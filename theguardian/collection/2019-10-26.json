Milat was one of six prime suspects in the cases of three women \u2013 Leanne Goodall, Robyn Hickie and Amanda Robinson \u2013 who all went missing near Newcastle, north of Sydney, near where he often worked as a road worker, within four months of each other between 1978 and 1979.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"47197834a9fef994c6d89490fe473f06aa8e39ab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/47197834a9fef994c6d89490fe473f06aa8e39ab/0_0_878_600/500.jpg\" alt=\"Ivan Milat\" width=\"500\" height=\"342\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Serial backpacker murderer Ivan Milat.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2002 Milat was<a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/coroner-criticises-police-over-missing-women-murders-20020705-gdffeq.html\"> called to give evidence at a coronial inquiry into their disappearances</a> but no charges were laid.</p> <p>The possibility that Milat did not act alone has been the subject of endless speculation.

In April 1992 they left Sydney again, with vague plans that seemed to involve heading south towards Victoria, or to Perth in Western Australia.</p> <p>When weeks passed without any contact with their parents, the two families sprang into action, alerting police in the UK and Australia and using the media to drum up interest in the case.</p> <p>It didn\u2019t take long for journalists to start linking their disappearance with other cases. In April 1992 an Australian television program followed Neugebauer\u2019s parents as they searched for their son, pointing to other missing backpackers.</p> <p>But it wasn\u2019t until September 1992, when two runners discovered the first of the bodies \u2013 Clarke and Walters \u2013 that the severity of the crimes began to emerge. Walters had been stabbed 21 times in the back and 14 times in the chest. Her spine had been severed by one vicious blow.

Was anyone waiting for him in Canberra?

Instead, he produced a gun and a length of rope, telling Onions: \u201cThis is a robbery.\u201d The backpacker made a run for it. The two fought and the man fired a shot before Onions managed to flag down a car and escape.</p> <p>He filed a report with police, who told him it was unlikely they would find the man responsible. But six years later Onions\u2019 testimony would be crucial to Milat\u2019s conviction. When police searched Milat\u2019s house in south-western Sydney in connection with the Onions robbery, they found items belonging to his victims. More belongings were discovered with his relatives.</p> <p>Milat was arrested in 1994 and convicted in 1996 after an 18-week trial. He was held in a high-security unit at Goulburn Supermax \u2013 home to Australia\u2019s most dangerous criminals.

      "bodyText": "When British backpackers Caroline Clarke and Joanne Walters were found brutally murdered in the Belanglo state forest in September 1992, the Sun ran the headline: \u201cBeast of the bush: Brit girls victims of Oz serial killer.\u201d The newspaper speculated that the killer \u201ccould be a fiend responsible for the disappearance of 20 people in the area over 20 years\u201d. Ivan Milat, who has died of cancer aged 74, was convicted in 1996 of the murder of seven people, aged 19 to 22, who disappeared while hitchhiking south of Sydney. But his death means his suspected involvement in several other disappearances may never be resolved. The backpacker killings became the subject of intense international media scrutiny and speculation after the discovery of seven victims\u2019 bodies in makeshift graves in 1992 and 1993. In the intervening years, Milat and the cold brutality of his crimes have held an enduring grip on the Australian psyche, and Belanglo has become a byword for horror. As the journalists Mark Whittaker and Les Kennedy wrote in their book about the case, Sins of the Brother, published in 1998, it was \u201ca peculiarly Australian story\u201d. The callous murders by the tanned, muscle-bound Australian with the Dennis Lillee moustache seemed to reveal something uncomfortable about the nation\u2019s character.

His father worked on the wharves in Sydney after migrating from Croatia after the first world war, while his devoted mother cared for the children. His father, a strict disciplinarian, eventually started a tomato plantation at the family property in Moorebank, western Sydney, where his sons were put to work. Neighbours have described the family as insular, and the young Milat did not stand out among his siblings. But as they grew older, the hold of his parents slipped.

Onions had managed to escape from Milat\u2019s vehicle in early 1990, and flew back to Australia during the investigation into the murders to identify him. In January 1990, three weeks after Everist and Gibson disappeared, Onions had hitched a ride to Canberra with a moustachioed man he would later describe as looking like the Australian cricketer Dennis Lillee. The trip began uneventfully but, as they made their way down the highway, Onions became unsettled by the questions the man, who gave his name as Bill, was asking: Did anyone know where he was headed?

      "body": "<p>Boris Johnson has been offered a route to securing the pre-Christmas election that he has been seeking, through a plan that would only require the support of a simple majority of MPs.</p> <p>With most Labour MPs still against the idea of a snap election, the prime minister looks set to lose his bid to secure a December poll on Monday in a vote that requires the backing of two-thirds of MPs. Other parties are also opposing an election until the EU has granted a three-month Brexit delay, although the DUP hinted on Saturday it could back the move.</p> <p>However, in a sign that the coalition opposed to an election is under strain, the Liberal Democrats have drawn up a plan allowing Johnson to secure a December poll with a simple majority of MPs, with the support of Jo Swinson\u2019s party and the SNP.</p> <p>Under the one-page Lib Dem bill, the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act would be amended to state that the next election would take place on 9 December, three days earlier than under Johnson\u2019s plans. It states that the new election date would be cancelled should the EU fail to grant a three-month Brexit extension.</p> <p>The party is asking Johnson to adopt the bill and guide it through parliament between Tuesday and Thursday of this week, before dissolving parliament.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has been offered a route to securing the pre-Christmas election that he has been seeking, through a plan that would only require the support of a simple majority of MPs. With most Labour MPs still against the idea of a snap election, the prime minister looks set to lose his bid to secure a December poll on Monday in a vote that requires the backing of two-thirds of MPs. Other parties are also opposing an election until the EU has granted a three-month Brexit delay, although the DUP hinted on Saturday it could back the move. However, in a sign that the coalition opposed to an election is under strain, the Liberal Democrats have drawn up a plan allowing Johnson to secure a December poll with a simple majority of MPs, with the support of Jo Swinson\u2019s party and the SNP. Under the one-page Lib Dem bill, the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act would be amended to state that the next election would take place on 9 December, three days earlier than under Johnson\u2019s plans. It states that the new election date would be cancelled should the EU fail to grant a three-month Brexit extension. The party is asking Johnson to adopt the bill and guide it through parliament between Tuesday and Thursday of this week, before dissolving parliament. It believes the timing of its plan means the prime minister would not be able to bring back his Brexit deal to the Commons before the election campaign starts \u2013 which he is currently threatening to do. Swinson said last night: \u201cBoris Johnson has missed his \u2018do-or-die\u2019 deadline and is now asking parliament to give him a general election and time for him to ram through his Brexit bill through parliament. That is a bad deal, and Liberal Democrats will not vote for it.

The Lib Dems and SNP are also writing to Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, calling on Brussels to offer Britain a Brexit extension to the end of January next year. The news comes with an Opinium poll for the Observer suggesting the Conservatives have a 16-point lead over Labour, which is split over an election. Jeremy Corbyn said on Saturday that his party would \u201cbe very happy to fight an election once all vestiges of a no-deal exit from the EU have been taken off the table\u201d.

The entire communities of Windsor and Healdsburg<strong>, </strong>where one of the original evacuation shelters was set up, were ordered to evacuate.</p> \n<p>The Sonoma county sheriff\u2019s office said it is expected to be the biggest evacuation in the county in more than 25 years<strong>,</strong> with warnings to be prepared to leave reaching the coast. Traffic snarled roadways leading out of the communities of Windsor and Healdsburg as residents scrambled to close up their homes, find last-minute accommodations and transport their livestock to safety.</p> \n<p>\u201cOnce we get that red-flag warning starting at 8pm and we get those high winds, we\u2019re going to see some erratic fire behavior,\u201d said the Cal Fire captain Stephen Volmer, a fire behavior analyst with the agency. \u201cThere is the potential for a lot of this fire-weakened timber to be falling down across power lines, across roads. There is also the potential for those long-ranged spotting issues that we have to ignite new fires.\u201d</p> \n<p>The National Weather Service described the conditions as \u201cthe strongest since the 2017 wine country fires and potentially a historic event given the strength and duration of the winds\u201d. The Tubbs fire of that year killed 22 people.</p> \n<p>The Kincade fire broke out late on Wednesday night and has so far destroyed nearly 50 structures. There have been no fatalities but a firefighter and two civilians were injured when they were overwhelmed by fire as they tried to evacuate from approaching flames, authorities said.<strong> </strong></p> \n<p>Meanwhile, millions across the state will have their power cut again as California\u2019s largest utility, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric (PG&amp;E), said it would shut off electricity for the third time in as many weeks. PG&amp;E said the power cuts would be implemented in stages through Saturday afternoon and evening for about 940,000 homes and businesses in 36 counties for 48 hours or longer throughout the San Francisco Bay Area, wine country and Sierra foothills. An estimated 2.35 million people are due to be affected, thousands more than previously predicted.</p> \n<p>Two previous power shutdowns were done amid concern that gusty winds could disrupt or knock down power lines and spark devastating wildfires.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5802cb58c442be9d996c96edbe6c8e645a261b55\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5802cb58c442be9d996c96edbe6c8e645a261b55/0_0_5600_3733/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Kincade fire burned near Geyserville, California on 24 October.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Kincade fire burned near Geyserville, California on 24 October.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Dasilva/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Another blaze that forced evacuations of 50,000 residents in suburbs north of Los Angeles grew to 4,615 acres overnight. The Tick fire, which started on Thursday, has destroyed nine homes and businesses while threatening 10,000 more, according to firefighters. While some evacuees were allowed back into their homes as of Friday night, certain mandatory evacuation orders still remained.</p> \n<p>As of Saturday afternoon the Tick fire was 25% contained, while the Kincade fire was 10% contained.</p> \n<p>California\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom, has declared a local emergency to assist with battling the blazes, and thousands of firefighters have been deployed to both locations. </p> \n<p>PG&amp;E has a history of sparking wildfires throughout the state, including two of the deadliest disasters in recent California history.</p> \n<p>Firefighters battling the Kincade fire discovered what appeared to be a broken jumper by a PG&amp;E transmission tower that had lost power. Though PG&amp;E had shut off power to the area as part of planned shutoff, the transmission lines remained energized, the utility said. The cause of the Kincade fire is still under investigation.</p> \n<p>The power shutoff in Geyserville created a dangerous challenge when it came time to evacuate residents as the blaze crept nearer. Typically during evacuations, local authorities deploy reverse 911 calls to alert individual residents. With the power out, evacuees reported being awakened in the early hours by frantic knocks on their front doors.</p> \n<p>Gavin Newsom has been highly critical of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/11/california-power-shutoffs-when-your-public-utility-is-owned-by-private-investors\">the investor-owned public utility</a> and the shutoffs, calling the impact \u201cunacceptable\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe gotta hold them accountable and we are going to do our best to get through these high wind events, and work Saturday, Sunday into Monday to get these lights back on and do everything in our power to make sure PG&amp;E is never in a position where they are doing this to us again,\u201d he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GavinNewsom/status/1188169722841272320\">said in a statement on Saturday</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ddfcc6ac-1dd5-4a69-ba17-1545ceded559\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Jrp9yqCUW40?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In San Diego county, where other small wildfires are burning, helicopters were forced to make the evacuation orders over loudspeaker because the power was shut off. San Diego runs its own utility and is conducting its own planned shutoffs during high-fire weather conditions.</p> \n<p>Californians in the vicinity of the fires faced a weekend of smokey haze and bad air quality. Sonoma county, where the Kincade fire rages, advised residents to cancel plans and stay indoors.</p> \n<p>In the Bay Area, with residents still leery after the heavy smoke event from last year\u2019s Camp fire, officials warned residents to close windows and use masks.

      "bodyText": "Californians braced for power cuts and a \u201cpotentially historic\u201d wind event on Saturday as a growing wildfire prompted fresh evacuations for 50,000 people in the northern Bay Area. The tumultuous Kincade fire spread to 25,455 acres in the wine-growing region of Sonoma county, with meteorologists warning of severe, windy conditions beginning Saturday night that could see gusts of up to 80mph. The entire communities of Windsor and Healdsburg, where one of the original evacuation shelters was set up, were ordered to evacuate. The Sonoma county sheriff\u2019s office said it is expected to be the biggest evacuation in the county in more than 25 years, with warnings to be prepared to leave reaching the coast. Traffic snarled roadways leading out of the communities of Windsor and Healdsburg as residents scrambled to close up their homes, find last-minute accommodations and transport their livestock to safety. \u201cOnce we get that red-flag warning starting at 8pm and we get those high winds, we\u2019re going to see some erratic fire behavior,\u201d said the Cal Fire captain Stephen Volmer, a fire behavior analyst with the agency. \u201cThere is the potential for a lot of this fire-weakened timber to be falling down across power lines, across roads. There is also the potential for those long-ranged spotting issues that we have to ignite new fires.\u201d The National Weather Service described the conditions as \u201cthe strongest since the 2017 wine country fires and potentially a historic event given the strength and duration of the winds\u201d. The Tubbs fire of that year killed 22 people. The Kincade fire broke out late on Wednesday night and has so far destroyed nearly 50 structures. There have been no fatalities but a firefighter and two civilians were injured when they were overwhelmed by fire as they tried to evacuate from approaching flames, authorities said. Meanwhile, millions across the state will have their power cut again as California\u2019s largest utility, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric (PG&amp;E), said it would shut off electricity for the third time in as many weeks. PG&amp;E said the power cuts would be implemented in stages through Saturday afternoon and evening for about 940,000 homes and businesses in 36 counties for 48 hours or longer throughout the San Francisco Bay Area, wine country and Sierra foothills. An estimated 2.35 million people are due to be affected, thousands more than previously predicted. Two previous power shutdowns were done amid concern that gusty winds could disrupt or knock down power lines and spark devastating wildfires. Another blaze that forced evacuations of 50,000 residents in suburbs north of Los Angeles grew to 4,615 acres overnight. The Tick fire, which started on Thursday, has destroyed nine homes and businesses while threatening 10,000 more, according to firefighters. While some evacuees were allowed back into their homes as of Friday night, certain mandatory evacuation orders still remained. As of Saturday afternoon the Tick fire was 25% contained, while the Kincade fire was 10% contained. California\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom, has declared a local emergency to assist with battling the blazes, and thousands of firefighters have been deployed to both locations. PG&amp;E has a history of sparking wildfires throughout the state, including two of the deadliest disasters in recent California history. Firefighters battling the Kincade fire discovered what appeared to be a broken jumper by a PG&amp;E transmission tower that had lost power. Though PG&amp;E had shut off power to the area as part of planned shutoff, the transmission lines remained energized, the utility said. The cause of the Kincade fire is still under investigation. The power shutoff in Geyserville created a dangerous challenge when it came time to evacuate residents as the blaze crept nearer. Typically during evacuations, local authorities deploy reverse 911 calls to alert individual residents. With the power out, evacuees reported being awakened in the early hours by frantic knocks on their front doors. Gavin Newsom has been highly critical of the investor-owned public utility and the shutoffs, calling the impact \u201cunacceptable\u201d. \u201cWe gotta hold them accountable and we are going to do our best to get through these high wind events, and work Saturday, Sunday into Monday to get these lights back on and do everything in our power to make sure PG&amp;E is never in a position where they are doing this to us again,\u201d he said in a statement on Saturday. In San Diego county, where other small wildfires are burning, helicopters were forced to make the evacuation orders over loudspeaker because the power was shut off. San Diego runs its own utility and is conducting its own planned shutoffs during high-fire weather conditions. Californians in the vicinity of the fires faced a weekend of smokey haze and bad air quality. Sonoma county, where the Kincade fire rages, advised residents to cancel plans and stay indoors. In the Bay Area, with residents still leery after the heavy smoke event from last year\u2019s Camp fire, officials warned residents to close windows and use masks. Local high school sporting events were canceled, while the University of California, Berkeley announced it was canceling all Saturday afternoon classes, as well as other indoor events and activities scheduled through Sunday. Though nine wildfires are currently burning throughout the state, none have reached the level of death and destruction witnessed in the past few years. Nevertheless fears remain, especially among those who lived through the devastation of the previous fires. The Kincade fire was raging near the path of the 2015 Valley fire, which killed four people and burned through more than 76,000 acres. The shadow of the Camp fire in Paradise, the deadliest in the state\u2019s history which left 86 dead, wasn\u2019t far off either. The senator and 2020 candidate Kamala Harris evoked the disaster in a tweet on Saturday. The harsh fire weather conditions have spread beyond the state, kicking up flames in parts of Baja California, just across the border from San Diego in Mexico. Mexican authorities say three people have died, with several fires forcing 1,645 people to evacuate their homes and burning more than 35,000 acres. \u201cThis is the strongest Santa Ana wind related-fires ever struck Baja California in its history, due to the number of cities and houses affected and the number of people that have perished,\u201d Antonio Rosquillas, the director of Baja California Civil Protection, told the San Diego Union-Tribune.

Few would argue with that. Kane\u2019s determination to haul himself into service and perform when, on occasion, he would have been excused an easier time of things is a burning testament to his character. With <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2019/jun/01/tottenham-hotspur-v-liverpool-champions-league-final-live\" title=\"\">that dispiriting night in Madrid</a> a notable exception, he has usually come good when the stakes are at their highest for Tottenham.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"d5d1eadb-a4b1-42cd-a335-32c1991d272f\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/aPWooE96p78?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>That includes the time 20 months ago at Anfield when Kane dusted himself down from a penalty miss to hold his nerve for a second spot\u2011kick and silence the Kop in the fifth minute of stoppage time, scoring his 100th Premier League goal just after Mohamed Salah appeared to have settled the issue for Liverpool. Spurs have not emerged from Liverpool\u2019s home with a win since May 2011, when Kane was still a loanee at Leyton Orient. He has scored there three times, though, and, on the back of a morale-boosting performance in Tuesday\u2019s cakewalk <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/22/tottenham-hotspur-red-star-belgrade-champions-league-match-report\" title=\"\">against Red Star Belgrade</a>, his appetite to give Van Dijk a sterner examination is evident.</p> \n<p>\u201cVan Dijk is a great defender but he is not invincible and Liverpool are not invincible,\u201d Kane said. On the former point he might have been harking back to an occasion in 2015 when he had the then Southampton player <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2017/dec/26/tottenham-hotspur-v-southampton-premier-league-live\" title=\"\">on toast at St Mary\u2019s</a>, opening the scoring after Van Dijk had let him in by swinging and missing wildly. Those mistakes might as well be hen\u2019s teeth nowadays but they are also the little morsels of knowledge \u2013 like knowing an opponent is clearly unfit \u2013 that players cling on to in those moments before knife\u2011edge confrontations.</p> \n<p>Kane is predictably keen to minimise scrutiny of the head\u2011to\u2011head. \u201cFrom my point of view it\u2019s just about playing my game and making my movements, doing my runs and trying to get on the scoresheet, trying to get assists,\u201d he said. In midweek he scored twice and for long periods dropped deep to act as a de facto playmaker. It was probably his best performance of the campaign, albeit against a poor side that offered none of the resistance Liverpool will present, and although there have been Tottenham players in far worse form it felt like a timely return to something approaching his maximum efficiency.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/26/alex-oxlade-chamberlain-adam-lallana-jurgen-klopp-liverpool-options\">Unlikely Liverpool heroes underscore J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s rich array of options</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Kane\u2019s figures have largely been down so far this season and, with Spurs grinding rather than flowing for the most part, that is little surprise. Opta statistics present an expected goals per game tally of 0.36 in the Premier League so far, by a considerable distance his lowest under Pochettino; the fact that his goal return of 0.56 per game (five in nine), although again on course to be his worst in a single season since 2013-14, comfortably exceeds that suggests the basics are still in good working order. But the numbers also show Kane is creating fewer chances, touching the ball less, engaging in fewer duels and winning a smaller percentage of them than at any point in the Argentinian\u2019s tenure. It is not to say that his performances have been poor; rather, that the side\u2019s wider malaise is doing few favours to the man everyone expects to keep on producing.</p> \n<p>On Friday, Pochettino rejected the notion that three points at Anfield would constitute a reset for his squad; a feat that might clear a few heads and persuade a few, inside and outside the club, that Spurs can still mix it with the very best. The idea was strange, he said, given they had already drawn at Manchester City and Arsenal. At the Emirates they frittered away a two\u2011goal lead, though, and since then the scars from Leicester, Brighton, Bayern Munich, Watford and even Colchester have mounted up.</p> \n<p>It all carries a faint resemblance to the autumn of 2016, when Spurs did not win in seven games before Kane \u2013 who was, familiarly, only just coming back from an ankle injury \u2013 turned a defeat into victory against West Ham with two goals at the very end. Pushing on to finish second in the league, as they did then, would be a remarkable feat in the current climate. \u201cMomentum\u2011wise, it would give us a huge lift,\u201d Kane said of any win against the undefeated league leaders. Through all this year\u2019s doubt and confusion, he remains the player best placed to deliver it.</p>",

With that dispiriting night in Madrid a notable exception, he has usually come good when the stakes are at their highest for Tottenham. That includes the time 20 months ago at Anfield when Kane dusted himself down from a penalty miss to hold his nerve for a second spot\u2011kick and silence the Kop in the fifth minute of stoppage time, scoring his 100th Premier League goal just after Mohamed Salah appeared to have settled the issue for Liverpool. Spurs have not emerged from Liverpool\u2019s home with a win since May 2011, when Kane was still a loanee at Leyton Orient. He has scored there three times, though, and, on the back of a morale-boosting performance in Tuesday\u2019s cakewalk against Red Star Belgrade, his appetite to give Van Dijk a sterner examination is evident. \u201cVan Dijk is a great defender but he is not invincible and Liverpool are not invincible,\u201d Kane said. On the former point he might have been harking back to an occasion in 2015 when he had the then Southampton player on toast at St Mary\u2019s, opening the scoring after Van Dijk had let him in by swinging and missing wildly. Those mistakes might as well be hen\u2019s teeth nowadays but they are also the little morsels of knowledge \u2013 like knowing an opponent is clearly unfit \u2013 that players cling on to in those moments before knife\u2011edge confrontations. Kane is predictably keen to minimise scrutiny of the head\u2011to\u2011head. \u201cFrom my point of view it\u2019s just about playing my game and making my movements, doing my runs and trying to get on the scoresheet, trying to get assists,\u201d he said. In midweek he scored twice and for long periods dropped deep to act as a de facto playmaker. It was probably his best performance of the campaign, albeit against a poor side that offered none of the resistance Liverpool will present, and although there have been Tottenham players in far worse form it felt like a timely return to something approaching his maximum efficiency. Kane\u2019s figures have largely been down so far this season and, with Spurs grinding rather than flowing for the most part, that is little surprise. Opta statistics present an expected goals per game tally of 0.36 in the Premier League so far, by a considerable distance his lowest under Pochettino; the fact that his goal return of 0.56 per game (five in nine), although again on course to be his worst in a single season since 2013-14, comfortably exceeds that suggests the basics are still in good working order. But the numbers also show Kane is creating fewer chances, touching the ball less, engaging in fewer duels and winning a smaller percentage of them than at any point in the Argentinian\u2019s tenure. It is not to say that his performances have been poor; rather, that the side\u2019s wider malaise is doing few favours to the man everyone expects to keep on producing. On Friday, Pochettino rejected the notion that three points at Anfield would constitute a reset for his squad; a feat that might clear a few heads and persuade a few, inside and outside the club, that Spurs can still mix it with the very best. The idea was strange, he said, given they had already drawn at Manchester City and Arsenal. At the Emirates they frittered away a two\u2011goal lead, though, and since then the scars from Leicester, Brighton, Bayern Munich, Watford and even Colchester have mounted up. It all carries a faint resemblance to the autumn of 2016, when Spurs did not win in seven games before Kane \u2013 who was, familiarly, only just coming back from an ankle injury \u2013 turned a defeat into victory against West Ham with two goals at the very end. Pushing on to finish second in the league, as they did then, would be a remarkable feat in the current climate. \u201cMomentum\u2011wise, it would give us a huge lift,\u201d Kane said of any win against the undefeated league leaders. Through all this year\u2019s doubt and confusion, he remains the player best placed to deliver it.",

Everything changed in September 2017, the day he had to give a coaching demonstration as part of his coursework. He received a phone call while he was waiting to go in from the Dragons head coach, Bernard Jackman. The club had suffered a sudden run of injuries and needed him on the bench for their game against the Southern Kings in the Pro 14. He did not go on, but did the next week, for the last 10 minutes of a 14-point defeat at the Cardiff Blues. \u201cThat was a massive step for me,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was then I realised it was going to be a lot more serious than I thought it would be.\u201d Wainwright ended up playing 25 games for the Dragons that season. The summer after it was over, Gatland gave him 30 minutes at the end of a Test against Argentina in San Juan. He made his first start against Tonga that November and since then he has featured in every Test as a starter or a replacement. In two years, Wainwright has gone from the university first XV to being man of the match in a World Cup quarter-final against France. If you had told him then that how his life was going to play out he says he would have laughed. A lot of his friends still are. \u201cI\u2019m still very friendly with a lot of the boys and they can\u2019t believe how far I\u2019ve come.\u201d A bunch of his old university teammates wanted to come over to support him but their student loans could not cover the airfare. Instead he will go and watch them as soon as he is home. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to get back and watch them playing on a Wednesday night.\u201d Because it is all so close, his ties to the community are pretty tight. He still does a lot of coaching down at Whiteside, using what he learned on his degree course. He was there working with them the night before he flew out to Japan. \u201cHaving that relationship is massive. The support they give me as well helps me every week. \u201cSome players come through a system in which they are put in an academy from a young age don\u2019t get that relationship with a grassroots club. I was very fortunate that my local club welcomed me with both arms and I\u2019ve still got a very good relationship with them.\u201d It means he has his feet on the ground, which is one reason why Warburton has suggested Wainwright may make a good captain. Gatland has already persuaded him to take on a leadership role and in the quarter\u2011final against France you could see him barking orders to teammates. Some of this success is natural talent. His father was a flanker too, for Caerphilly and some is what he has done with it; he was 80kg when he went to university but the Dragons wanted him to bulk up, so he worked his way up to 104kg in the next 18 months. But more of it is down to the system Gatland has created. There is a reason they have been able to make it this far even after they have lost key players to injuries and it is because they can spot the potential in a player such as Wainwright and given him everything he needs to help him fulfil it.",

      "bodyText": "The best personnel decision Donald Trump has made, Mitt Romney said in an interview published on Saturday, \u201cwas not choosing me\u201d. After winning the White House in 2016. Trump toyed with the idea \u2013 and in doing so rather cruelly toyed with the man \u2013 of appointing Romney secretary of state. The contender for the Republican nomination in 2008 and nominee in 2012 had already called Trump a \u201cphony\u201d. The job went to an oil baron. \u201cI would not have lasted as long as Rex Tillerson,\u201d Romney told the New York Times. Tillerson was fired by Trump \u2013 by tweet, reportedly while on the toilet \u2013 in March 2018, after a year on the job. Romney also told the New York Times he thought he would have lasted \u201cmaybe a little longer than Anthony Scaramucci\u201d. That was a reference to the hedge-funder-cum-White House communications director who served for less than two weeks. Tillerson reportedly called Trump \u201ca fucking moron\u201d while he was secretary of state but has largely remained quiet since leaving the administration. Scaramucci is now a vocal critic of the president, touring cable news shows to pontificate on the impeachment inquiry and plead for Trump\u2019s removal or defeat. Romney is now a senator from Utah and a more subtle but persistent critic. Trump recently called him \u201ca pompous ass\u201d and doubtlessly counted him among the \u201cNever Trumper\u201d Republicans he called \u201chuman scum\u201d in a tweet this week. The former Massachusetts governor\u2019s Times interview was part of a media campaign which this week saw him essentially out himself as \u201cPierre Delecto\u201d, a rather more secretive Twitter user than the man in charge. Republican critics of the decision to use a pseudonym, a practice formerly followed by Trump nemesis James Comey, generally chose not to comment on Trump\u2019s admitted use of assumed names to praise himself in the past. \u201cPeople say to me, \u2018If you\u2019re critical of the president you\u2019re hurting the party,\u2019\u201d Romney said. \u201cNo I\u2019m not \u2013 I\u2019m laying out a path for the party post the president.\u201d Trump might be defeated at the polls next year. Or if as seems likely he is impeached by the House, he might yet be convicted and removed by the Senate. That chamber is held by Republicans guided by Mitch McConnell, the majority leader and a staunch Trump ally. That makes it seem highly unlikely 20 Republicans will vote for Trump\u2019s removal. But some leading Republican voices have suggested enough senators could yet decide that defending Trump over his attempts to force Ukraine to investigate his political rivals is not worth their reputations or the cost to the party as a whole. Romney might then emerge as a figurehead. In accordance with reports McConnell is preparing his party for a trial, Romney told the Times he has been reading the Federalist Papers and other constitutional texts. Also on Saturday, Romney told the Washington Post: \u201cI am going to wait to see if impeachment articles come. If they do come, I will review all the facts as they are presented at that point and make a decision which I believe is right.\u201d The Post detailed Romney and Trump\u2019s long relationship and an attempted rapprochement earlier this year. Romney\u2019s niece Ronna McDaniel is chair of the Republican party, but she reportedly dropped Romney from her name at Trump\u2019s request. According to the Post, it took Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, formerly a fierce opponent of Trump but now a stout ally, to set up a private meeting. That went reasonably well, the Post said, but Romney soon publicly expressed his disappointment with Trump over foreign policy issues including Ukraine, China and Syria. Graham told the Post Trump now realises \u201cthe damage has been done\u201d. The senator also said: \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll go into marriage counselling.\u201d Romney told the Times his wife, Ann, had convinced him to run for the Senate last year in part by asking: \u201cWhat would your dad do?\u201d George Romney was a Michigan governor who ran for the Republican nomination as a moderate in the age of Barry Goldwater and the party\u2019s lurch to the right. \u201cYou know,\u201d Romney told the Times, \u201cjust because you weren\u2019t made general doesn\u2019t mean you stop fighting.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>It was a magnificent seventh for Frank Lampard and a glorious, if belated, start for Christian Pulisic. Chelsea gave their rookie manager a seventh straight win, taking them level on points with Leicester. The transformation of an ageing team has been propelled by homegrown youngsters, and a potentially tricky trip to Turf Moor became a sweet affair for the 21-year-old from Hershey, Pennsylvania. Pulisic\u2019s first Chelsea goals were a perfect hat-trick, in more ways than one, scored with his left foot, his right and his head, capping a stunning display. It offered ample evidence of why Chelsea paid \u00a358m for him and brought the rare sound of their fans chorusing: \u201cUSA, USA.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI am absolutely delighted for him,\u201d Lampard said. \u201cIt was a fantastic match-winning appearance. He showed the full package. There has been a lot of talk around Christian for the big price tag. He is quite rightly a star in his own country. I know the back story and the pressure of the move.

Pulisic has been overshadowed by Mason Mount and Tammy Abraham but, on his first league start since August, he upstaged them, taking the striker\u2019s record as Chelsea\u2019s youngest hat-trick scorer in the Premier League. A first treble of his senior career came as such a surprise to the scorer that he forgot to claim the match ball. His teammates duly collected and signed it.

      "bodyText": "It was a magnificent seventh for Frank Lampard and a glorious, if belated, start for Christian Pulisic. Chelsea gave their rookie manager a seventh straight win, taking them level on points with Leicester. The transformation of an ageing team has been propelled by homegrown youngsters, and a potentially tricky trip to Turf Moor became a sweet affair for the 21-year-old from Hershey, Pennsylvania. Pulisic\u2019s first Chelsea goals were a perfect hat-trick, in more ways than one, scored with his left foot, his right and his head, capping a stunning display. It offered ample evidence of why Chelsea paid \u00a358m for him and brought the rare sound of their fans chorusing: \u201cUSA, USA.\u201d \u201cI am absolutely delighted for him,\u201d Lampard said. \u201cIt was a fantastic match-winning appearance. He showed the full package. There has been a lot of talk around Christian for the big price tag. He is quite rightly a star in his own country. I know the back story and the pressure of the move. He [only] had a week\u2019s break in the summer, so why am I going to throw him in?\u201d Pulisic has had to be patient \u2013 \u201cI didn\u2019t think it was going to be super easy,\u201d he said \u2013 but after a frustrating two months, when the American has been a bit-part player and has not even made the bench at times, this was an explosion of excellence. Pulisic has been overshadowed by Mason Mount and Tammy Abraham but, on his first league start since August, he upstaged them, taking the striker\u2019s record as Chelsea\u2019s youngest hat-trick scorer in the Premier League. A first treble of his senior career came as such a surprise to the scorer that he forgot to claim the match ball. His teammates duly collected and signed it. It was the least they could do. Rewarded for his catalytic cameo against Ajax, when he set up Michy Batshuayi\u2019s winner, Pulisic made the most of his promotion. His opener was all of his own making. In different ways, he exposed three of the Burnley back four. He caught Matt Lowton dawdling in possession and surged away. He had the skill to dart past James Tarkowski and his angled shot went through Ben Mee\u2019s legs. Burnley were complicit in their own downfall and if Mee was luckless that Pulisic\u2019s second deflected in off him, Tarkowski had given the ball away to Willian, who sent the American powering into space. \u201cThe second goal is a killer,\u201d lamented Sean Dyche. \u201cBut you can\u2019t give away the chances we did tonight.\u201d Pulisic\u2019s third came with a glancing header from Mount\u2019s cross. \u201cBack in my youth days I scored a few headers, but professionally, no,\u201d said a surprised scorer. Willian drilled in the fourth from Abraham\u2019s pass. \u201cOur midfield combinations and movement were beautiful to watch,\u201d said Lampard. \u201cThere were so many great things to admire.\u201d His detractors could point out that the unloved Maurizio Sarri oversaw a four-goal victory at Turf Moor and that the Italian did so with a clean sheet. Yet this was emphatic and exhilarating, ambitious and auspicious. \u201cIt is a fun team to play with now,\u201d Pulisic said. The luckless Lowton was tormented while the demoted Callum Hudson-Odoi produced the wrong answer.

      "bodyText": "During the Senate estimates hearings this week, the main tactic government senators employed to obfuscate and delay answers has been to play dumb. And it should be said that they are very good in the role. Very, very good. They are so good that at times you can scarcely see the acting involved. I guess it is that \u201cinvisible school\u201d of acting where the aim is for viewers to think we are seeing the real person and not an act. Among the masters of obfuscation and pointless diversion is the finance minister, Mathias Cormann, who in the midst of the treasury secretary\u2019s testimony on Wednesday had a bit of a drive-by about spending by the ALP government during the GFC. Now it has been long known that the LNP is mostly GFC truthers \u2013 it was an event that happened elsewhere and thus there was no need for any stimulus spending. At this point in time they barely see any reason even for the stimulus they supported. As Katharine Murphy has noted, the current criticism of the GFC stimulus is out of a desire not to champion any fiscal stimulus given the calls for such measures now. Cormann brought a new twist to his criticism of the GFC stimulus when he suggested that it drove up interest rates and the value of our dollar. And he was very passionate about it \u2013 going full method-acting by taking the play out of estimates and onto Twitter, where he replied to Nine journalist Shane Wright\u2019s criticism, suggesting, \u201cYou have obviously forgotten what happened to the cash rate post Labor\u2019s reckless spending spree (pink batts, overpriced school halls etc). Or impact on exchange rate given very low cash rates and quantitative easing elsewhere after excessive Labor stimulus forced our rates up.\u201d Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Yep, it\u2019s 2019 and the Liberal party still wants to blame the ALP for high interest rates. It is instructive as to how much the Liberal party detests the thought of fiscal stimulus that Cormann was taking issue with the situation a decade ago where the cash rate fell from 7.25% to 3% in eight months and then took 19 months to rise to 4.75% \u2013 a rate lower than had existed throughout the final four years of the Howard government. And it is also instructive how lacking in logic the finance minister had to be to make such an argument.

But of course things were more complex. The notes from the RBA\u2019s meetings at the time show more was at play \u2013 namely that the RBA did not want to keep interest rates at emergency levels for longer than was needed. The RBA noted as it increased rates that \u201cpublic spending was prominent in driving aggregate demand for several quarters but this impact is now lessening\u201d. It also noted that \u201cthe cash rate was lowered quickly, to a very low level, in expectation of very weak economic conditions and a recognition that considerable downside risks existed. That basis for such a low interest rate setting has now passed.\u201d Would Cormann have wished those conditions did not pass? The RBA also continually noted \u201cinterest rates to most borrowers nonetheless remain lower than average.\u201d And as for the stimulus being the reason for the exchange rate going up, at that time our terms of trade (the price of our exports compared with our imports) rose 30% \u2013 the biggest increase ever recorded over such a period. You would hope Cormann might have remembered that. As the RBA noted when it increased the cash rate to 4.75%, \u201cthe exchange rate has risen significantly this year, reflecting the high level of commodity prices\u201d and \u201cthe economy is now subject to a large expansionary shock from the high terms of trade\u201d. In 2013, the RBA estimated that the mining boom caused the real exchange rate to be 44 per cent higher in 2013 than it otherwise would have been.

Worse still, the budget was structurally put into deficit with unfunded promises &amp; disastrous taxes (some which raised no money)\u201d. Well now. That is just flat out wrong. The Parliamentary Budget Office looked extensively into the structural position of the budget and determined that \u201cover two thirds\u201d of the decline in the structural budget position was due to the \u201ccumulative effect of the successive personal income tax cuts granted between 2003-04 and 2008-09\u201d and a further quarter of the fall was due to \u201ca decline in excise and customs duties\u201d because of \u201cthe abolition of petroleum fuels excise indexation in the 2001-02 budget and the decline in the consumption of cigarettes and tobacco over the period.\u201d It also noted that the \u201ctemporary fiscal stimulus spending in response to the GFC\u201d did not directly affect the structural position of the budget because, well, it was temporary.

The job of an employment consultant is basically tick and flick. You started at 8.30am and the phones would turn on at 9am. Until then they were on message bank, though no one knew the passcode to the message system so none of us could get into the system. If someone tried to do the right thing and call ahead of time, I would never know about it.</p> <p>After the phones came on, you\u2019d have appointments every half-hour. You\u2019d ask someone how they\u2019re going and whether they\u2019ve done their job search. Then you\u2019d have your lunch break and an hour at the end of the day to type up any notes.</p> <p>The other person who started with me quit six weeks in. When they left, my caseload doubled as all the permanent staff had quit, and I was the only case manager and sometimes the only person in the office. This meant I had 15 minutes to spend with people who were often incredibly vulnerable. The worst off among them would come in and you\u2019d know behind the scenes their life was a mess. They were homeless, or out on parole, or had addictions. Sometimes I had to cut off their payments for one bureaucratic infraction or another. I consider myself a fairly ethical person with a good sense of social justice. Before long I was asking myself, how the hell did I end up here doing this to these people?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I had 15 minutes to spend with people who were often incredibly vulnerable</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Sometimes I would cheat and mark off a non-attendance as something else, but then in July 2018 they started monitoring what we did from the departmental level. There\u2019s a code for everything and if you had too many codes it would ping. At the monthly performance review, you\u2019d get called in and they\u2019d grill you about it.</p> <p>It was still easy to game the system. Case managers have quotas for the number of people they have to get into work. You could have one person working five different jobs, over five days for one hour a day and that\u2019ll count as five separate jobs, which means you\u2019ve met your stream quota. You could easily take the statistics they report for the number of people they\u2019ve helped into jobs, halve it and halve it again for those who have enough work to live on. Who can live off one hour a week?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8acfc3210fa500df31b2a6d8847aede5f2535edf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8acfc3210fa500df31b2a6d8847aede5f2535edf/0_0_5616_3371/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018What the Jobactive network has done is turn unemployment into an industry.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018What the Jobactive network has done is turn unemployment into an industry.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lukas Coch/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The worst part was that there was a big meeting with employers and training organisations where they told the government about this. They explained how they gamed the system. Nothing changed. What the Jobactive network has done is turn unemployment into an industry. It\u2019s a way of taking someone who doesn\u2019t have discretionary income and turning them into a product to make money, which these companies are set up to feed on \u2013 and the government is paying for it all.</p> <h2><strong>Name: Anonymous</strong></h2> <h2><strong>Location: Victoria</strong></h2> <h2><strong>Experience: Currently working for a Jobactive provider</strong></h2> <p>Working at the Jobactive provider is honestly one of the most stressful jobs I have ever had..</p> <p>Generally, my job is to handle all the basic admin and meet people at the door, but they also put me in charge of managing cases even though I didn\u2019t have the time \u2013 or training. Generally, a person who deals with us is tranched by Centrelink into one of three streams, depending on how long they have been unemployed: Stream A, Stream B, or Stream C. I was put in charge of handling Stream As, who have only been receiving a payment for less than three months. In principle, they are considered to have no barriers to employment but the reality is the company makes no money from them and so doesn\u2019t really care about them. I even had a couple of cases where people in Stream A were guaranteed a job, but we couldn\u2019t help them pay for the necessary safety equipment, so they missed out.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The manager was always telling us not to be lenient</p> <footer> <cite></cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Of those I worked with, those who were new were always more understanding and more willing to make exemptions. The longer a person worked there, the more likely they were to just see jobseekers as walking dollar signs. Meanwhile, the manager was always telling us not to be lenient. If a jobseeker missed an appointment, she didn\u2019t want you to listen to their side of things and let it slide if you thought it was appropriate. She wanted you to penalise them \u2013 no matter what.

For example, if someone had submitted an exemption, and I could see it on their file, I would make a telephone appointment with them instead of asking them to come in.

      "bodyText": "About 400,000 unemployed Australians are obliged to engage with Jobactive, the government\u2019s main employment services program, in order to keep their social security payment. Since the late 1990s, Australia has paid private companies and non-profits to run the 1,800 job centres around the country. They are tasked with getting people into work. In February this year the Jobactive network was the subject of a Senate inquiry which heard from those who work within the system about the high turnover of staff, impossible caseloads, low levels of training, mistreatment by consultants and a lack of engagement from employers. Here, three people who have worked for Jobactive providers speak about the failings in the system. They have all chosen to remain anonymous because they fear for their jobs. Name: Anonymous Location: ACT Experience: Worked for a Jobactive provider for 16 months in 2017-19 I always thought I was a cynical person to start with, but my time with the Jobactive provider has made me worse. The job of an employment consultant is basically tick and flick. You started at 8.30am and the phones would turn on at 9am. Until then they were on message bank, though no one knew the passcode to the message system so none of us could get into the system. If someone tried to do the right thing and call ahead of time, I would never know about it. After the phones came on, you\u2019d have appointments every half-hour. You\u2019d ask someone how they\u2019re going and whether they\u2019ve done their job search. Then you\u2019d have your lunch break and an hour at the end of the day to type up any notes. The other person who started with me quit six weeks in. When they left, my caseload doubled as all the permanent staff had quit, and I was the only case manager and sometimes the only person in the office. This meant I had 15 minutes to spend with people who were often incredibly vulnerable. The worst off among them would come in and you\u2019d know behind the scenes their life was a mess. They were homeless, or out on parole, or had addictions. Sometimes I had to cut off their payments for one bureaucratic infraction or another. I consider myself a fairly ethical person with a good sense of social justice. Before long I was asking myself, how the hell did I end up here doing this to these people? Sometimes I would cheat and mark off a non-attendance as something else, but then in July 2018 they started monitoring what we did from the departmental level. There\u2019s a code for everything and if you had too many codes it would ping. At the monthly performance review, you\u2019d get called in and they\u2019d grill you about it. It was still easy to game the system. Case managers have quotas for the number of people they have to get into work. You could have one person working five different jobs, over five days for one hour a day and that\u2019ll count as five separate jobs, which means you\u2019ve met your stream quota. You could easily take the statistics they report for the number of people they\u2019ve helped into jobs, halve it and halve it again for those who have enough work to live on. Who can live off one hour a week? The worst part was that there was a big meeting with employers and training organisations where they told the government about this. They explained how they gamed the system. Nothing changed. What the Jobactive network has done is turn unemployment into an industry. It\u2019s a way of taking someone who doesn\u2019t have discretionary income and turning them into a product to make money, which these companies are set up to feed on \u2013 and the government is paying for it all. Name: Anonymous Location: Victoria Experience: Currently working for a Jobactive provider Working at the Jobactive provider is honestly one of the most stressful jobs I have ever had.. Generally, my job is to handle all the basic admin and meet people at the door, but they also put me in charge of managing cases even though I didn\u2019t have the time \u2013 or training. Generally, a person who deals with us is tranched by Centrelink into one of three streams, depending on how long they have been unemployed: Stream A, Stream B, or Stream C. I was put in charge of handling Stream As, who have only been receiving a payment for less than three months. In principle, they are considered to have no barriers to employment but the reality is the company makes no money from them and so doesn\u2019t really care about them. I even had a couple of cases where people in Stream A were guaranteed a job, but we couldn\u2019t help them pay for the necessary safety equipment, so they missed out. Of those I worked with, those who were new were always more understanding and more willing to make exemptions. The longer a person worked there, the more likely they were to just see jobseekers as walking dollar signs. Meanwhile, the manager was always telling us not to be lenient. If a jobseeker missed an appointment, she didn\u2019t want you to listen to their side of things and let it slide if you thought it was appropriate. She wanted you to penalise them \u2013 no matter what. I didn\u2019t agree with that. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning There were always a few cases where people were trying to take advantage, but they were rare. Most people, most of the time, were trying to do the right thing. There were a few situations where I\u2019d bend the rules to help someone. Others I know did the same. For example, if someone had submitted an exemption, and I could see it on their file, I would make a telephone appointment with them instead of asking them to come in. I wouldn\u2019t tell my manager about it as I was afraid of getting caught. If you weren\u2019t strict enough and she found out, she would take you aside and suggest you do things differently. There was never any direct threat to your job, but it was more of an implied threat.

CI Resources, which won the contract, includes the former Western Australian government minister for state development Clive Brown on its board. It was one of two parties to tender for the contract, an Australian Border Force spokesman said. Both border force and the company declined to say how many people were employed under the maintenance contract. However, the Union of Christmas Island Workers secretary, Gordon Thomson, told Guardian Australia CI Resources employed about eight cleaners and six gardeners at the detention centre. He said this was fewer than the approximately 25 cleaners and five to six gardeners employed when services giant Serco held the contract. Serco continues to provide guards to the detention centre as part of a separate master contract with home affairs worth a total of $2.5bn. Despite the lack of detainees, there are 96 Serco staff working at the centre, parliament heard on Monday. Christmas Island\u2019s only detainees are a family of two Tamil asylum seekers and their two Australian-born daughters, who are currently fighting moves by the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, to deport them to Sri Lanka. A border force spokesman said that under its contract, CI Resources is responsible for \u201crepairs, maintenance, cleaning and waste removal\u201d as well as transporting and booking rooms for detention centre staff. He said CI Resources \u201chas held contracts for similar services on Christmas Island\u201d. However, a company spokesman said it last worked at the centre about a decade ago. The maintenance contract has the potential to boost ailing profits at CI Resources, which controls a phosphate mine on Christmas Island that has been hit by poor demand for the fertiliser in its key markets of Malaysia and Indonesia. Sales of phosphate dropped from 643,000 tonnes to 486,000 tonnes in the 2018-19 financial year, the company said in its annual report, and profit fell from $21m to $8.6m. Thomson said his union was currently locked in battle with CI Resources over a round of redundancies at the mine. \u201cThey\u2019ve been telling us for some time they\u2019ll be reducing employment because they\u2019ve got reduced demand,\u201d he said. \u201cThey say the market\u2019s gone to shit and the price has gone to shit and everything has gone to shit.\u201d CI Resources, which claims to be directly or indirectly responsible for half the economic activity on Christmas Island, is closely linked to Malaysia\u2019s Tee family, whose Prosper Group is a large palm oil producer. Palm oil is a controversial commodity because it is linked to the large-scale destruction of forests. In the company\u2019s annual report, the managing director, Lai Ah Hong, said the detention centre contract was \u201ca wonderful result for [maintenance subsidiary] CIMS and the Christmas Island community!\u201d \u201cThis contract will provide continued employment opportunities for locals and contractors over its term while helping deliver on our diversification strategy,\u201d he said. Tender documents show the contract runs for three years from 1 July this year. \u201cThe contract provides facilities management services, staff accommodation management and concierge services,\u201d the border force spokesman said. \u201cFacilities management includes services such as repairs, maintenance, cleaning and waste removal. \u201cStaff accommodation management and concierge include services such as room bookings, check in, maintenance reporting and transport.\u201d However, Thomson said CI Resources was \u201cstill settling their services\u201d. \u201cThey haven\u2019t got a real handle on the job yet, so we\u2019ve objected,\u201d he said.

On 13 October, Kurdish leaders agreed to allow Syrian regime forces to enter some cities to protect them from being captured by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey\">Turkey</a>&nbsp;and its allies. The deal effectively hands over control of huge swathes of the region to Damascus.</p>\n    <p>That leaves north-eastern&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/syria\">Syria</a>&nbsp;divided between Syrian regime forces, Syrian opposition militia and their Turkish allies, and areas still held by the SDF \u2013 for now.</p>\n    <p>On 17 October Turkish president,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/recep-tayyip-erdogan\">Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan</a>, agreed with US vice-president Mike Pence, to suspend Ankara\u2019s operation for&nbsp; five days in order to allow Kurdish troops to withdraw. The following week, on 22 October, Erdo\u011fan and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/22/turkey-and-russia-agree-deal-over-buffer-zone-in-northern-syria\">agreed on the parameters of the proposed Turkish \u201csafe zone\u201d</a> in Syria.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How did the SDF come to control the region?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Before the SDF was formed in 2015, the Kurds had created their own militias who mobilised during the Syrian civil war to defend Kurdish cities and villages and carve out what they hoped would eventually at least become a semi-autonomous province.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>In late 2014, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/20/turkey-iraqi-kurds-kobani-isis-fighters-us-air-drops-arms\">Kurds were struggling</a>&nbsp;to fend off an Islamic State siege of Kobane, a major city under their control. With US support, including arms and airstrikes, the Kurds managed to beat back Isis and went on to win a string of victories against the radical militant group. Along the way the fighters absorbed non-Kurdish groups, changed their name to the SDF and grew to include 60,000 soldiers.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Why does Turkey oppose the Kurds?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>For years, Turkey has watched the growing ties between the US and SDF with alarm. Significant numbers of the Kurds in the SDF were also members of the People\u2019s Protection Units (YPG), an offshoot of the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 party (PKK) that has fought an insurgency against the Turkish state for more than 35 years in which as many as 40,000 people have died. The PKK initially called for independence and now demands greater autonomy for Kurds inside&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey\">Turkey</a>.</p>\n    <p>Turkey claims the PKK has continued to wage war on the Turkish state, even as it has assisted in the fight against Isis.

Because of the bombardment of the Kurdish-controlled north-east region of Syria, he was hastily buried without a funeral. \u201cPeople were too frightened,\u201d Elyas says. \u201cIt was too dangerous. When people gather, that\u2019s when the bombs come. He was buried without a funeral, without people saying goodbye.\u201d Elyas\u2019s father was forced from his home in northern Syria by a Turkish operation last year, and lived the last months of his life in a displaced people\u2019s camp before succumbing to a heart attack. Now, Elyas says he fears for his remaining family still trapped in Rojava. \u201cEvery second or third day, I can make contact with them,\u201d Elyas says through an interpreter, speaking Kurdish, the mother-tongue he\u2019s been restricted from speaking for much of his life. \u201cBut I worry all day, every day, for my brothers, my sisters and cousins. There are many children. I fear for their future, and for my people.\u201d Australia\u2019s Kurdish community says it has been devastated by the sudden withdrawal of US troops from north-east Syria, effectively greenlighting a long promised military operation by Turkey to clear the area on its border of what it alleges are insurgent Kurdish forces. But the Kurdish community in Australia says the allegations of terrorism are fabrications, and that the Turkish operation has far broader objectives: they fear a genocide. A declared ceasefire has ostensibly ended the current military operation but clashes continue, and the fragile truce has left Turkish troops occupying large swathes of territory in Syria\u2019s north-east, with Russian and Syrian troops controlling the rest of the frontier. Hundreds of Syrian refugees have been forced back into that country by Turkey, and Kurdish semi-autonomous control of Syria\u2019s north-east faces being forcibly extinguished. In Sydney, members of the Kurdish diaspora gather to comfort each other and to share the latest information on the military operation, the wellbeing of relatives and their hopes for the fragile ceasefire.

It\u2019s a badge of honour, but also frustrating because inside we\u2019re all screaming: \u201cgoji berry?

Many who\u2019ve never eaten it are curious about it now, since popular health literature has talked it up big. And so it should. Bitter melons are chock-a-block with fibre, vitamins, minerals and then some more. They\u2019re a hard sell for restaurants though \u2013 it\u2019s not called bitter for nothing. The strong flavour either needs to be celebrated, or muted.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"31826b91a6973304ce945ade08988bf449019e89\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/31826b91a6973304ce945ade08988bf449019e89/394_0_8760_3460/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An albino alligator (left) and a white bitter melon (right).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"395\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It was such a pretty vegetable, like a miniature albino alligator in vegetal form.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph:  Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I once grew a white variety for chef Peter Gilmore as a trial.

Perfect, except it would\u2019ve dominated the entire dish with its lovely medicinal bitterness. Not what most chefs are looking for \u2013 no matter how pretty.</p> <p>Instead, bitter melon is relegated to home cooking and more rustic kitchens, like our restaurants. We put it on our menu for the first time this year, during its peak season.

But I can understand why so many of us who grew up old-world feel indignant when foods get declared \u201cnewly discovered\u201d or \u201ca superfood\u201d. It\u2019s a badge of honour, but also frustrating because inside we\u2019re all screaming: \u201cgoji berry? We\u2019ve been sucking on those in our TCM soups from the womb!\u201d Turmeric, coconut oil, animal fats, all the fats \u2026 don\u2019t even get me started on ageing fish ... like I said, a badge of honour. So it is with bitter melon (Momordica charantia). Many who\u2019ve never eaten it are curious about it now, since popular health literature has talked it up big. And so it should. Bitter melons are chock-a-block with fibre, vitamins, minerals and then some more. They\u2019re a hard sell for restaurants though \u2013 it\u2019s not called bitter for nothing. The strong flavour either needs to be celebrated, or muted. I once grew a white variety for chef Peter Gilmore as a trial. It was such a pretty vegetable, like a miniature albino alligator in vegetal form, if you can imagine such a thing. It would\u2019ve made the perfect garnish on one of his daintily-gorgeous dishes, shaved paper-thin equatorially. Perfect, except it would\u2019ve dominated the entire dish with its lovely medicinal bitterness. Not what most chefs are looking for \u2013 no matter how pretty. Instead, bitter melon is relegated to home cooking and more rustic kitchens, like our restaurants. We put it on our menu for the first time this year, during its peak season. We did it because I wanted to eat it daily and because they were growing prolifically on the farm, and no one else would buy them. And you know what? So many people ordered it! It sold out. General consensus declared it the most pleasurably nostalgic dish. Diners were always describing the family member who best cooked it (often their grandma) and how what they\u2019d just eaten had made them reminisce. So next time you go to an Asian grocer and see that knobbly, green, alligator-looking veg, just remember \u201cbuy it, cook it, eat it \u2013 it\u2019s really good for you\u201d. Just don\u2019t scrunch up your pretty face when you taste it. Stuffed bitter melon in chicken broth (aka my happy soup) Read the recipe before you attempt this \u2013 there are a few steps that require advanced preparation. Serves four Step one: the stuffing 1 kg of pastured pork mince preferably 30% fat 6 cloves of garlic minced finely 1 small knob of organic ginger grated 1 tbs preserved salted radishes chopped finely 1 tsp white pepper 3 tbs Braggs Aminos protein or light soy sauce 1 tsp salt 3tbs best-quality sesame oil 2 organic free-range egg beaten Mix all the above ingredients together with your hands until well incorporated, then refrigerate, covered, with a tea towel, for at least an hour. Overnight is ideal. Step two: prepping the melon 4 medium bitter melons \u2013 choose ones that have rounded ridges Cut the melon into 10cm logs and core out the pith and seeds gently with a spoon. Stuff all the way to edges. If you have any stuffing left over, form it into meatballs. Step three: making the soup 2 litres chicken stock (homemade is best) 4 dried shiitake mushrooms rehydrated and quartered 1 bunch coriander \u2013 finely chop the stem and leaves, smack the roots until flattened 1 bunch spring onions finely sliced 2tbs of Braggs Aminos 2tbs best-quality fish sauce 1tsp ground white pepper 2tbs of shallot oil you made last week Bring the stock to boil with the flattened coriander root and shiitake mushrooms. Place the stuffed bitter melon and meatballs into the pot gently and simmer low for 20 minutes or until the pork has cooked all the way through and the bitter melon has softened. Season with Braggs and fish sauce. When ready to serve, portion out the bitter melon and extra meat balls, ladle broth over and garnish with coriander and spring onions, drizzle with the shallot oil and dust with the white pepper. Overnight this soup gets better, so always make more than you think you can eat, because your liver will thank you and you\u2019ll want to go do some chin-ups after.

      "body": "<p>D aniele De Rossi came to Buenos Aires to follow a dream. He was 36 and had a fine career behind him. He could have retired. He could have opted for a sinecure in the Middle East or China. He could have gone into coaching or television punditry. But instead, having spent his entire senior career at Roma, he signed for Boca Juniors.</p> <p>Things haven\u2019t gone according to plan, however. A persistent hamstring injury has restricted him to 334 minutes of football since arriving in July. De Rossi was on the bench for Tuesday\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/23/river-plate-held-by-boca-juniors-but-advance-to-copa-libertadores-final\" title=\"\">Copa Libertadores semi-final</a> against River Plate but he did not come on as Boca won 1-0 and went out 2-1 on aggregate. His presence seemed less about him potentially playing than about trying to use his experience to calm others and perhaps even letting him feel a <em>supercl\u00e1sico</em> close up.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/23/river-plate-held-by-boca-juniors-but-advance-to-copa-libertadores-final\">River Plate make Copa Libertadores final despite defeat to Boca Juniors</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What is clear is that this is not some ego trip for De Rossi and nor has he come for the money. When he arrived in Buenos Aires after a 13-hour flight, he headed immediately to Boca\u2019s base and trained with the rest of the squad that afternoon. The next day, he turned up at 6am, before anybody else, and put in an order for 100 Boca shirts so he could distribute them among his friends and family.</p> <p>His reasons for feeling such affection for Boca are not entirely clear. It is a club with historical links to Italy \u2013 one of their nicknames is <em>Los </em><em>Xeneizes</em>, the Genovese \u2013 but De Rossi\u2019s desire to play for them seems linked more to his respect for Boca\u2019s great icon of the past 30 years, Juan Rom\u00e1n Riquelme. He is part of a WhatsApp group with friends whose sole topic of discussion is midfielders; the group\u2019s avatar is Riquelme.</p> <p>The danger when such an obvious high-class player arrives is that he might dominate the dressing room or disdain his teammates, but others at the club have been struck by De Rossi\u2019s humility and his commitment in training. His Spanish is decent other than when the talk switches to tactics, when he has to rely on the translation skills of Carlos Tevez, Mauro Z\u00e1rate and Lisandro L\u00f3pez.</p> <p>Perhaps it is down to his lack of pitch time but the most striking aspect of De Rossi\u2019s spell in Argentina is how few ripples he has made. He has done one television interview, and that from the side of the training pitch rather than anything longer and more formal in a studio, and he seems rarely to leave his hotel in the redeveloped waterfront area of Puerto Madero, where he lives alone after his wife and children decided to remain in Rome. The only comment anybody can remember him making about Buenos Aires is to ask why there are so many street protests.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2a07efa8f17b932006e4f84797a6e92e087cb1ba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2a07efa8f17b932006e4f84797a6e92e087cb1ba/0_0_2274_1556/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An aerial view of La Bombonera as fireworks welcome the teams to the pitch before the Copa Libertadores semi-final second leg.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"684\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An aerial view of La Bombonera as fireworks welcome the teams to the pitch before the Copa Libertadores semi-final second leg.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tomas Cuesta/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>De Rossi is highly unusual.

      "bodyText": "D aniele De Rossi came to Buenos Aires to follow a dream. He was 36 and had a fine career behind him. He could have retired. He could have opted for a sinecure in the Middle East or China. He could have gone into coaching or television punditry. But instead, having spent his entire senior career at Roma, he signed for Boca Juniors. Things haven\u2019t gone according to plan, however. A persistent hamstring injury has restricted him to 334 minutes of football since arriving in July. De Rossi was on the bench for Tuesday\u2019s Copa Libertadores semi-final against River Plate but he did not come on as Boca won 1-0 and went out 2-1 on aggregate. His presence seemed less about him potentially playing than about trying to use his experience to calm others and perhaps even letting him feel a supercl\u00e1sico close up. What is clear is that this is not some ego trip for De Rossi and nor has he come for the money. When he arrived in Buenos Aires after a 13-hour flight, he headed immediately to Boca\u2019s base and trained with the rest of the squad that afternoon. The next day, he turned up at 6am, before anybody else, and put in an order for 100 Boca shirts so he could distribute them among his friends and family. His reasons for feeling such affection for Boca are not entirely clear. It is a club with historical links to Italy \u2013 one of their nicknames is Los Xeneizes, the Genovese \u2013 but De Rossi\u2019s desire to play for them seems linked more to his respect for Boca\u2019s great icon of the past 30 years, Juan Rom\u00e1n Riquelme. He is part of a WhatsApp group with friends whose sole topic of discussion is midfielders; the group\u2019s avatar is Riquelme. The danger when such an obvious high-class player arrives is that he might dominate the dressing room or disdain his teammates, but others at the club have been struck by De Rossi\u2019s humility and his commitment in training. His Spanish is decent other than when the talk switches to tactics, when he has to rely on the translation skills of Carlos Tevez, Mauro Z\u00e1rate and Lisandro L\u00f3pez. Perhaps it is down to his lack of pitch time but the most striking aspect of De Rossi\u2019s spell in Argentina is how few ripples he has made. He has done one television interview, and that from the side of the training pitch rather than anything longer and more formal in a studio, and he seems rarely to leave his hotel in the redeveloped waterfront area of Puerto Madero, where he lives alone after his wife and children decided to remain in Rome. The only comment anybody can remember him making about Buenos Aires is to ask why there are so many street protests. De Rossi is highly unusual. He is one of four Europeans playing in the Argentina top-flight, but the other three \u2013 Jos\u00e9 Mauri (Italy), Norberto Briasco (Armenia) and Dylan Gissi (Switzerland) \u2013 have Argentinian parents, with the first two being born in Argentina. The first European with no such heritage to sign for an Argentinian club since the Hungarian Ferenc Sas joined Boca in 1938, De Rossi has 117 caps. He was a mainstay of Italy for years. The only player of comparable status to move to Argentina, who was not playing a sentimental final season or two for a former club, is the former France forward David Trezeguet, who played for River Plate and Newell\u2019s Old Boys between 2012 and 2014, but his parents are Argentinian and he grew up in Buenos Aires. That is the grim truth of globalisation, the traffic is almost all one way. In Argentina, they talk of the talent doughnut: anybody of any promise leaves when they are in their teens. Some return in their 30s but anybody who is in their 20s and is playing in the Argentinian league either is not very good or has some particular reason why they cannot travel. Around 1,800 Argentinians are playing abroad. And that, necessarily, has an impact on the quality. Tuesday\u2019s supercl\u00e1sico, for its colour and passion, was a poor game, all free-kicks and corners. Of the impudent creativity of the No 10s, on which the myth of Argentinian football is based, the only trace was the mercurial Colombian Juan Fernando Quintero, who was on the bench for River, but in the circumstances never likely to come on. Despite the poverty of the play \u2013 and the dilapidated state of most of the grounds and the continuing threat of violence \u2013 Argentina still has the 11th-highest average attendance of any league in the world. Love of the clubs, and perhaps love of the sense of togetherness and common identity that can still be found on the terraces, overrides all else. Or at least that is the romantic explanation. But really, is that saying anything different to the marketing wonk who would about strong brand identification? To western European football, where the money is, where the best football is, Argentina is a market and, in as much as it exists beyond that, it is as a place of theatre, but theatre where the act is in the stand rather than the stage.

And lovely attacking football, too. Lesson in intelligent leadership for other clubs, possibly?\u201d</p> <p>Indeed. It was obvious from his first punditry shift that he could articulate the game better than most, and it seems his man-management is equally impressive.

      "bodyText": "Richard Jolly\u2019s match report has landed, so I\u2019ll leave you with that. Thanks for your company - goodnight! Havingt seen another replay, I think Pulisic\u2019s second might actually have been an own-goal from Ben Mee. Egil Ostenstadt had a hat-trick for Southampton against Manchester United taken off him by the Dubious Goals Panel in 1996-97; I\u2019ve no idea how it works these days. The thoughts of Christian Pulisic \u201cIt\u2019s unreal. What a day for me, obviously. I\u2019ve even happier with the result, although I wish we\u2019d kept a clean sheet. I honestly didn\u2019t even think about it [getting the match ball from the referee], but thankfully my team-mates reminded me. \u201cBack in my youth days I scored a few headers - but professionally, no This is only the second one I can remember. I was just able to flick it on, and when I turned round I couldn\u2019t believe it had gone in! \u201cThe first few months were definitely hard. I had a few starts earlier in the season and then I fell out of the team. The last two weeks I\u2019ve been able to help the team. I didn\u2019t think it would happen right away \u2013 when you come into a big club like this, it takes time. I\u2019m happy with the progress I\u2019ve made so far. The team have been fantastic, they\u2019ve given me so much help.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not normally one for praising promoting ex-players to managerial roles - rose-tinted selction glasses, etc. - but Lamps seems to be doing a brilliant job,\u201d says Bill Hargreaves. \u201cTo bring on youth like that, and move on players with amicable handshakes (a la Luiz) in order to remould the team in your shape, is pretty admirable, I think. And lovely attacking football, too. Lesson in intelligent leadership for other clubs, possibly?\u201d Indeed. It was obvious from his first punditry shift that he could articulate the game better than most, and it seems his man-management is equally impressive. That transfer ban was the best thing to happen to Chelsea, although I suspect Lampard would have prioritised the younger players anyway. Their success will hopefully have a knock-on effect throughout the Premier League. Peep peep! Another thrilling attacking performance from Chelsea gave a seventh consecutive win. Christian Pulisic scored a perfect hat-trick, the first of his career, to come of age as a Chelsea player, and Willian added a fourth bnefore the hour. A 4-0 scoreline would have been really harsh on Burnley. Two late goals gave a fairer reflection of an eventful match. 90+2 min Brady is booked for fouling Giroud. I\u2019m not sure why he bothered, because Giroud was moving at glacial pace. 90+1 min Four minutes of added time. 90 min Lowton\u2019s cross is headed behind by the stretching James. Vydra heads the corner over the bar. What a strange ending to the game this has been. That said, the scoreline is much fairer on Burnley. It\u2019s a funny old game. McNeil gives the scoreline a sheen of respectability with a 20-yard shot that deflects off Tomori and wrongfoots Arrizabalaga. Pick that out! Jay Rodriguez saunters forward and crashes a dipping shot from 30 yards that flies over Arrizabalaga and into the net. A second look suggests the keeper might have done better, as it was nowhere near the corner, but it was an explosive strike. 84 min Robbie Brady replaces Jeff Hendrick. While that happens, we\u2019re watching replays of the Hudson-Odoi booking. He was clearly pushed by Lowton - not enough for a penalty, but enough to affect his balance when he then tried to jump past Tarkowski. 80 min Hudson-Odoi fizzes a low cross-shot just wide. He\u2019s looked very sharp since coming on. The competition for places in Chelsea\u2019s attacking midfield positions is exceedingly healthy. 78 min An excellent point from Rob Hawthorne, the Sky Sports commentator: a few incidents today, including that non-penalty and the penalty that was given at Brighton, suggest the \u2018clear and obvious\u2019 bar has been lowered considerably since last weekend\u2019s games. What this means, in practice, is more subjective decision-making, more perceived injustice and more conversations about VAR. Drink! NO PENALTY! Hudson-Odoi is booked for diving. Frank Lampard has a wry smile on his face. My feeling is that it wasn\u2019t a penalty, because Tarkowski pulled his leg out of the way, but nor was it a dive - Hudson-Odoi went down because he tried to jump between two defenders and lost his balance. 76 min: PENALTY TO CHELSEA! Hudson-Odoi plays a nice one-two with Mount and goes down after a challenge from Tarkowski. This might be overturned by VAR. 75 min Mount\u2019s free-kick hits the wall. 74 min Hudson-Odoi is fouled just outside the area by Tarkowski. He\u2019d lost the ball but Michael Oliver gave the free-kick. It\u2019s a fair way to the left of centre, but I think Mount will go for goal... 73 min Hudson-Odoi\u2019s 20-yard curler is comfortably held by Pope as he falls to his left. 72 min Willian, who has swapped wings with Pulisic, wins a corner on the break. That\u2019s his last touch of the game; he is replaced by Callum Hudson-Odoi. It\u2019s been another excellent performance from Willian, who has been revitalised under Frank Lampard. 71 min For 55 minutes this was extremely hard work for Chelsea, but now they have the full strut on. They could easily score another couple. 70 min Tammy Abraham is replaced by Olivier Giroud. 68 min Willian\u2019s whipped shot from the edge of the area is blocked by Mee on the six-yard line. Then Pulisic\u2019s delicious chipped cross beats Pope and is headed behind by Lowton. 67 min Pieters is booked for a lunge on James. 66 min Life moves pretty fast in the Premier League, but at the moment Leicester and Chelsea look comfortably the best of the rest. Chelsea have been a revelation, not least because they\u2019ve been without their best player for much of the season. 65 min Rodriguez is booked for a foul on Kovacic. 64 min Superb defending from the substitute James, who blocks goalbound shoots from Westwood and McNeil in the space of two seconds. 64 min A \u2018perfect\u2019 hat-trick from Pulisic no less - left foot, right foot, header,\u201d says Callum Macauley. \u201cNot bad at all.\u201d 63 min A Chelsea substitution: Reece James replaces Marcos Alonso. Azpilicueta will move to left-back. And Burnley bring on Matej Vydra for poor Ashley Barnes, who has had a beast. 62 min Tomori keeps Chelsea\u2019s sheet clean with an immense recovery tackle on Rodriguez, who was through on goal and in the act of shooting when Tomori appeared from nowhere to block. 61 min Chelsea scored 24 away goals in 19 league games last season. This year they have 16 in five. 59 min The scoreline is seriously harsh on Burnley. But this is what Chelsea can do when they have space to break into. They have scored 16 away goals in the Premier League this season, more than any other team. William has made it 4-0 on the break. Kovacic played a penetrative pass into Abraham, who turned and eased a simple pass towards Willian in the inside-right channel. He ran at Pieters, moved the ball to the right and drove a crisp low shot into the far corner. What a time to be a Chelsea fan! What a story! Pulisic, recalled to the side tonight, has scored all three. The goal came when Mount\u2019s left-wing corner was headed back out to him. He curled a beautiful, dipping ball towards the near post, where Pulisic got in front of Rodriguez to score with a very clever header. He was moving away from goal so allowed the ball to deflect off the side of his head, from where it drifted into the far corner. There was doubtless a bit of luck involved as well, but I\u2019m pretty sure he intended that. Anyway, who gives a stuff: he\u2019s scored a hat-trick! Christian Pulisic gets his hat-trick! 53 min Willian is booked for pulling back McNeil. 51 min A smart snapshot from Rodriguez is well held by Arrizabalaga. Burnley have made enough openings in this match for Chelsea to be wary, even at 2-0. 49 min Cork flips a nice pass over the defence to Barnes, who mistimes an attempted volley on the turn. It sliced off the outside of his boot. 47 min Pieters\u2019 cross from the byline is shanked by Zouma into the face of Arrizabalaga and behind for a corner. I\u2019m not sure whether Zouma\u2019s shank would have gone into the net or wide of the far post; either way, it wasn\u2019t the most Baresian piece of defending. 46 min Peep peep! Chelsea begin the second half. Half-time reading Peep peep! Chelsea are well on course for a seventh consecutive win. The scoreline is harsh on Burnley in terms of the run of play, but they made egregious mistakes for both Christian Pulisic\u2019s goals. His selection, ahead of Callum Hudson-Odoi, was another inspired move from Frank Lampard. Another Burnley error, another goal. Tarkowski played a poor pass into midfield - he won\u2019t be doing that again - that was intercepted by Willian. His touch diverted the ball to Pulisic in the centre circle and he went straight for goal. He reached the edge of the area, made an angled run away from a couple of defenders and drove a low shot that took a big deflection off Mee and sneaked in at the near post. Pulisic has done it again! 43 min Willian\u2019s ambitious volley, from Pulisic\u2019s crossfield pass, is comfortably saved by Pope. Chelsea are having a fine spell. 42 min Chelsea move the ball really nicely to get Mount in behind the defence on the right, but his cross is intercepted by Westwood. 39 min Abraham, who has been quiet for much of the half, receives a pass from Pulisic and sweeps a curling shot just wide from inside the D. Pope had it covered. 37 min Lowton makes an important headed clearance from Pulisic\u2019s cross, which would otherwise have been headed towards goal by Alonso. 36 min A wishy-washy near-post clearance from Tarkowski goes straight to Pulisic 12 yards from goal. His shot is blocked. 35 min It\u2019s not news, this, but Dwight McNeil is seriously good for a 19-year-old. 34 min The lively McNeil plays a good pass into Barnes, who moves the ball away from Tomori but blasts high and wide from 15 yards. 32 min Chelsea are struggling to deal with Burnley\u2019s style, particularly their set pieces. 30 min: What a chance for Barnes! That should have been 1-1. Westwood floated a free-kick beyond the far post, where Mee towered above Alonso to loop a header back across goal. It took Kepa out of the game and reached the unmarked Barnes, who somehow headed wide from six yards. He must have been unsighted. 28 min: Fine save from Pope! Willian pinged a sweet crossfield pass to Pulisic on the left side of the area. He took the ball down on his chest and hit an early shot towards goal. It took a deflection off Lowton and forced an awkward but very good save from Pope, plunging to his left. 25 min Arrizabalaga makes a good save from Pieters\u2019 deflected volley. He was moving to his left but adjusted well to hold the top half of his body and punch the ball away. Burnley have responded superbly to going behind. 23 min McNeil\u2019s deep, inswinging corner is headed back into the six-yard box by Tarkowski, but Barnes can\u2019t direct his header on target. He was moving away from goal, which is why the header went sideways rather than towards goal. 23 min Barnes beats the offside trap on the right wing, moves into the area ... and then leaves the ball behind. It was a bad mistake from Lowton, who was caught in two minds and lost the ball to Pulisic just past the halfway line. He scurried into the penalty area, and although Tarkowski seemed to have pushed him wide, Pulisic managed to thread a low left-footed shot back across goal and into the corner. Christian Pulisic gets his first goal for Chelsea! 19 min A nice run from McNeil, who beats Jorginho and then Azpilicueta before crossing too close to Arrizabalaga. 19 min \u201cIf the photo is any guide, Chelsea are playing in white shirts and shorts with blue socks,\u201d says Charles Antaki. \u201cI like to see a good reverse kit, since most outfits don\u2019t really allow for it or produce the identical effect (any stripes) or abominations (reverse Arsenal doesn\u2019t bear thinking about). A rarity to be savoured.\u201d 17 min A long spell of Chelsea possession ends when Willian clips a cross straight out of play. It hasn\u2019t been a great start to the game. 15 min Pulisic leads a good Chelsea break and finds Mount in the area. He gets the ball out of his feet and hits a low shot that is really well blocked by Pieters. 14 min The second corner, from Westwood, is a poor one that swings straight out of play. 13 min Burnley win their first corner. McNeil swings it under the crossbar, forcing the stretching Zouma to head behind for another corner. 10 min Burnley are disrupting Chelsea\u2019s rhythm pretty effectively, and as a result the game hasn\u2019t really settled down. 8 min Zouma is receiving treatment after falling into the advertising boards. He looks okay. 5 min Willian has the first shot, crashing it high over the bar from 20 yards. 4 min Nopthing much to report so far. Chelsea have had plenty of the ball, but all in front of the Burnley defence. 1 min Peep peep! Burnley, in claret and blue, kick off from left to right as we watch. Chelsea are in white. The players emerge from the tunnel, all looking thoroughly ready for action. And why not. A Burnley win would lift them to fifth in the table. Chelsea will stay fourth regardless of the result, unless they win 12-0. Some pre-match reading Burnley (4-4-2) Pope; Lowton, Tarkowski, Mee, Pieters; Hendrick, Cork, Westwood, McNeil; Rodriguez, Barnes. Substitutes: Hart, Taylor, Bardsley, Long, Brady, Lennon, Vydra. Chelsea (4-3-3) Arrizabalaga; Azpilicueta, Zouma, Tomori, Alonso; Kovacic, Jorginho, Mount; Willian, Abraham, Pulisic. Substitutes: Caballero, James, Guehi, Pedro, Giroud, Hudson-Odoi, Batshuayi. Referee Michael Oliver. Hello. This is an intriguing rite of passage for Chelsea\u2019s young side - the unique challenge of playing at Turf Moor. Chelsea\u2019s away form has been exemplary since their unfortunate 4-0 defeat at Old Trafford on the opening weekend: five games, five wins, 15 goals scored. Burnley\u2019s home form has been equally good, with the exception of a heavy defeat to Liverpool. Burnley away on a bracing evening has become the new Stoke-on-a-wet-and-windy-night, the kind of game where happy young footballers supposed to be found out. If Chelsea win here, it will be another impressive statement. Kick off is at 5.30pm.",

      "body": "<p>The number of British citizens leaving for European Union countries is at a 10-year high, with the rate of departure accelerating since the referendum, new research has revealed.</p> <p>According to initial findings of a report on the migration of UK citizens, 84,000 people are expected to leave Britain for another EU nation this year, compared with 59,000 in 2008. It found that about 11,500 people moved from the UK to Germany in 2018, compared with more than 8,500 in 2008.</p> <p>The analysis \u2013 carried out by the Oxford in Berlin group and the WZB, the Berlin Social Science Centre \u2013 also found that the number of British people signing up for German citizenship had risen significantly. While 622 Britons received German citizenship in 2015, 7,493 were naturalised in 2017, a figure that is expected to rise this year. For the EU as a whole, naturalisations rose from 2,106 in 2015 to 14,678 in 2017.</p> <p>Daniel Tetlow, co-author of the study, which also looked at the changing nature of being British abroad, said that behind the figures lay the emergence of \u201ca new social phenomenon in British identity\u201d. \u201cOne of the things I find most striking is this new British-European identity that many refer to. And no, it\u2019s not just the privileged metro middle classes; I\u2019ve met proud British mechanics, ex-British forces, British ambulance drivers, British teachers and unemployed Brits, and because of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\" title=\"\">Brexit</a> almost all of them feel a new motivation in being active Europeans, and no less British as a result,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s partly self-preservation in these uncertain times, but I also see emerging a new social phenomenon in British identity and migration because people are now so convinced of the value of being British and European.\u201d</p> <p>The analysis used OECD figures and national government statistics. Qualitative research surveys were carried out over four months with British citizens in Germany who left the UK between 2008-2019. Of those interviewed, researchers said 30% had described Brexit as having had a direct impact on their mental health. Half said that they would consider giving up their British nationality if necessary to be able to keep their EU nationality. Securing citizenship allows Britons to retain the advantages of EU membership.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/oct/2019-10-25T12:56:05/embed.html\" data-alt=\"britons being naturalised in Germany\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/oct/2019-10-25T12:56:05/embed.html\">britons being naturalised in Germany</a> </figure>",

      "bodyText": "The number of British citizens leaving for European Union countries is at a 10-year high, with the rate of departure accelerating since the referendum, new research has revealed. According to initial findings of a report on the migration of UK citizens, 84,000 people are expected to leave Britain for another EU nation this year, compared with 59,000 in 2008. It found that about 11,500 people moved from the UK to Germany in 2018, compared with more than 8,500 in 2008. The analysis \u2013 carried out by the Oxford in Berlin group and the WZB, the Berlin Social Science Centre \u2013 also found that the number of British people signing up for German citizenship had risen significantly. While 622 Britons received German citizenship in 2015, 7,493 were naturalised in 2017, a figure that is expected to rise this year. For the EU as a whole, naturalisations rose from 2,106 in 2015 to 14,678 in 2017. Daniel Tetlow, co-author of the study, which also looked at the changing nature of being British abroad, said that behind the figures lay the emergence of \u201ca new social phenomenon in British identity\u201d. \u201cOne of the things I find most striking is this new British-European identity that many refer to. And no, it\u2019s not just the privileged metro middle classes; I\u2019ve met proud British mechanics, ex-British forces, British ambulance drivers, British teachers and unemployed Brits, and because of Brexit almost all of them feel a new motivation in being active Europeans, and no less British as a result,\u201d he said. \u201cYes, that\u2019s partly self-preservation in these uncertain times, but I also see emerging a new social phenomenon in British identity and migration because people are now so convinced of the value of being British and European.\u201d The analysis used OECD figures and national government statistics. Qualitative research surveys were carried out over four months with British citizens in Germany who left the UK between 2008-2019. Of those interviewed, researchers said 30% had described Brexit as having had a direct impact on their mental health. Half said that they would consider giving up their British nationality if necessary to be able to keep their EU nationality. Securing citizenship allows Britons to retain the advantages of EU membership.",

So far the only families to have gone public with their concerns about missing loved-ones are those of Pham Thi Tra My, a 26-year-old woman, and Nguyen Dinh Luong, 20.</p> \n<p>On Friday the family of Pham <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/25/vietnamese-family-fears-daughter-among-essex-lorry-victims\">revealed they had paid \u00a330,000 for her to travel</a> to the UK, but were increasingly fearful she was sealed inside the refrigerated container when she finally arrived.

Tu and Nhung had joined the huge numbers fleeing one of Vietnam\u2019s poorest provinces. According to a recent report by the Pacific Links Foundation, a US-based anti-trafficking organisation, more victims are trafficked from Nghe An than anywhere else in Vietnam to be exploited in Europe.</p> \n<p>\u201cNghe An is a top source province for labour or guest workers moving overseas,\u201d said the report.

For now, they can only pray. \u201cI will hold a ceremony to pray for them tonight,\u201d said Nam.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Throughout the day, prayers for the dead rang out over loudspeakers. Residents, their heads bowed, could be seen walking solemnly through Yen Thanh\u2019s rain-soaked streets. Situated in a remote stretch of Vietnam\u2019s Nghe An province, Yen Thanh is where many of the 39 people found dead in the back of a lorry 6,000 miles away in Essex are believed to have started their tragic journey. The district now finds itself at the epicentre of a global police inquiry into the smuggling ring thought to be responsible for the UK\u2019s biggest murder investigation since the 7/7 London bombings. One Catholic priest, Fr Anthony Dang Huu Nam, is among those who have started the macabre task of collating contact details for all the victims\u2019 families. \u201cThe whole district is covered in sorrow,\u201d Nam said. \u201cThis is a catastrophe for our community.\u201d On Saturday night, at the family house of Nguyen Dinh Tu in Phu Xuan, one of the people suspected to have died in the lorry, mourners streamed in and out all day to pay their respects. Inside the house, a dozen women sat on the floor on mats, their eyes red from crying. Tu, the youngest of five brothers and sisters, left home for Europe in March, paying 70m dong (\u00a32,350) to get to Romania, the Observer understands. After working in Romania for some months, he went to Germany and then decided to go to the UK, where his father in law lives, to earn more money. Tu\u2019s father-in-law helped him contact people smugglers who said they could help him get to England \u2013 for a cost of \u00a311,000. He made it to France but his family said they lost contact with him on 22 October. That was the last they heard from him. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard anything from my son,\u201d Nguyen Dinh Sat said. The scale of the tragedy emerged last Wednesday on a bleak industrial estate in Grays at 1.40am when a call was made to paramedics alerting them to a grisly discovery. Yet, four days on, major gaps in our knowledge remain. How the 31 men and eight women came to be in the truck is not yet known. Neither is exactly where all of the victims came from. Police are still desperately trying to track down the driver who delivered the trailer to the Belgian port in Zeebrugge before it was ferried on Tuesday afternoon across the channel to Purfleet in Essex. Belgian authorities have been tasked with \u201ctracking the route of the container\u201d and apprehending anyone responsible for \u201ccollaborating with the transport.\u201d CCTV at Zeebrugge tracked the sought-after lorry as it arrived at the terminal with reports indicating it was filmed 10 times at the port. On Saturday Dirk de Fauw, mayor of Bruges and chair of the port of Zeebrugge, confirmed no breakthrough had been made but was aware some of the suspected victims had been spotted in the country shortly before the tragedy. Among them was Vietnamese teenager Bui Thi Nhung, whose Facebook page showed her sightseeing in Brussels on 18 October, before she told friends she was making her way to France and onto the UK where she had relatives. On 21 October, two days before the doomed truck was discovered, a friend asked the 19-year-old how her journey was going. \u201cAlmost spring,\u201d Nhung responded, using a term in Vietnamese meaning she had almost reached her destination. The teenager then went quiet. On Saturday dozens of worried relatives gathered in the family\u2019s modest courtyard home where her distraught mother lies bedbound from anxiety. \u201cWe are waiting and hoping it\u2019s not her among the victims, but it\u2019s very likely. We pray for her everyday. There were two people from my village travelling in that group,\u201d said Hoang Thi Linh, Nhung\u2019s cousin. Despite an initial statement from Essex police that the 39 victims were Chinese, emerging evidence suggests it is increasingly likely that the majority of victims were from Vietnam. Essex police revealed on Saturday that detectives had met the Vietnamese ambassador and were \u201cengaging\u201d with the UK\u2019s Vietnamese community to try to identify victims, though could not rule out other nationalities among the dead. Previous similar tragedies suggest the identification process will take many more days. So far the only families to have gone public with their concerns about missing loved-ones are those of Pham Thi Tra My, a 26-year-old woman, and Nguyen Dinh Luong, 20. On Friday the family of Pham revealed they had paid \u00a330,000 for her to travel to the UK, but were increasingly fearful she was sealed inside the refrigerated container when she finally arrived. A sequence of messages stated: \u201cI\u2019m sorry Mum. My path abroad has not succeeded. Mum, I love you so much. I\u2019m dying because I can\u2019t breathe.\u201d Luong earlier this month told family that he planned to travel to Britain from France. His father has described receiving a call several days ago from a Vietnamese individual saying that \u201csomething unexpected happened\u201d. In Phu Xuan, Tu\u2019s family were in a state of agonising limbo, their relative\u2019s death not official, but strongly feared. Tu\u2019s wife, Hoang Thi Thuong, said she still owed money to the people smugglers who had offered to get him to Britain, although some reports yesterday said those responsible were handing out refunds to families of the dead. \u201cI have a big debt to pay, no hope, and no energy to do anything,\u201d she told Reuters. Tu and Nhung had joined the huge numbers fleeing one of Vietnam\u2019s poorest provinces. According to a recent report by the Pacific Links Foundation, a US-based anti-trafficking organisation, more victims are trafficked from Nghe An than anywhere else in Vietnam to be exploited in Europe. \u201cNghe An is a top source province for labour or guest workers moving overseas,\u201d said the report. Analysing the province\u2019s demographics, it found 58% of the population \u2013 1.8 million out of 3.1 million people \u2013 are eligible as \u201clabour resources\u201d and that many families in Nghe An have close relatives who work overseas, including a significant number of parents whose children are then left in the care of extended family For those who remain in the town, located 180 miles south of Hanoi, it remains to be a seen whether last week\u2019s tragedy will slow the exodus. For now, they can only pray. \u201cI will hold a ceremony to pray for them tonight,\u201d said Nam.",

      "body": "<p>It was 1am the night before we published <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/cambridge-analytica-files\" title=\"\">the Cambridge Analytica files</a> in March last year and I got an urgent message from my fellow reporter, Emma Graham-Harrison. Facebook, which that day had sent us a letter threatening legal action if we published, had issued a press release saying it had kicked Cambridge Analytica off its platform.</p> <p>It was a last-gasp attempt to get ahead of a story that Facebook knew was set to break. But it was too late. We worked through the night, brought forward our publishing time, and then the story was out there.</p> <p>If this seems like ancient history, it isn\u2019t. Because last week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/mark-zuckerberg\" title=\"\">Mark Zuckerberg</a> appeared before the US Congress\u2019s House financial services committee to talk about Facebook\u2019s plans for its Libra cryptocurrency and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/alexandria-ocasio-cortez\" title=\"\">Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</a>, the congresswoman for New York\u2019s 14th district, got <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/23/mark-zuckerberg-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-facebook-cambridge-analytica\" title=\"\">five minutes to grill him</a>.</p> <p>\u201cMr Zuckerberg, I think you of all people can appreciate using a person\u2019s past behaviour in order to determine, make decisions or predict people\u2019s future behaviour, and in order for us to make decisions about Libra I think we need to kind of dig into your past behaviour and Facebook\u2019s past behaviour with respect to our democracy. Mr Zuckerberg, what year and month did you personally become aware of Cambridge Analytica?\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>The fact is that the Cambridge Analytica data scandal is far from over. In some ways, it\u2019s only just beginning</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Watching it on a small screen on my phone, I was on the edge of my seat. This was the question that I and a small group of super-nerds, which includes <a href=\"https://www.lbc.co.uk/news/cambridge-analytica-dcms-evidence-brexit-leave-eu/\" title=\"\">MPs such as Damian Collins and Ian Lucas,</a> have been banging on about for more than a year. Because Zuckerberg last testified to Congress in April 2018 but so many more facts have come to light since. Facts that cast serious doubts over that testimony. Doubts that have opened up a serious question: did he lie on oath to Congress?</p> <p>This is what Ocasio-Cortez was trying to dig into. \u201cI\u2019m not sure of the exact time,\u201d said Zuckerberg. \u201cBut it was probably around the time when it became public, I think it was around March of 2018, I could be wrong.\u201d</p> <p>The problem for Zuckerberg is not that this defies common sense, though it does. It\u2019s that it opens up a whole new world of trouble for Facebook. To understand why, you need to go back to the four days that followed Facebook\u2019s legal threat to us and then its middle-of-the-night press release. Four days in which Facebook\u2019s stock market value plummeted more than $100bn and the company went into lockdown. When Zuckerberg finally emerged, a story was in place. The problem for him is that this has steadily been unravelling ever since.</p> <p>In July this year, a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigation revealed that employees knew that Cambridge Analytica, described as a \u201csketchy\u201d business, had been \u201cscraping\u201d Facebook data in 2015, before even the <em>Guardian</em>\u2019s first report.</p> <p>What about Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg? Ocasio-Cortez asked. When did she know? What about board member <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/peter-thiel\" title=\"\">Peter Thiel</a>? Zuckerberg drew a blank. His memory banks had nothing.</p> <p>\u201cThis was the largest data scandal with respect to your company that had catastrophic impacts with regard to 2016\u2026 and you don\u2019t know?\u201d asked Ocasio-Cortez.</p> <p>\u201cCongresswoman, we discussed it when we were aware of what happened.\u201d</p> <p>The evidence continues to mount. And the answers Zuckerberg gave Ocasio-Cortez only invite further questions. The fact is that the Cambridge Analytica data scandal is far from over. In some ways, it\u2019s only just beginning. It\u2019s not the crime, as the saying goes, it\u2019s the cover-up. And that continues.</p> <p>Because we know Facebook lied. The SEC investigation says that. To us at the <em>Observer</em>, in fact \u201c\u2026 when asked by reporters in 2017 about its investigation into the Cambridge Analytica matter, Facebook falsely claimed the company found no evidence of wrongdoing\u201d.</p> <p>On 7 November, I will give evidence to the international grand committee of parliamentarians from nine countries who have banded together to try to get answers from Facebook. But Zuckerberg has again refused to give evidence to the representatives of countries numbering more than half a billion people.</p> <p>We have to recognise that Facebook is a foreign company that operates beyond the reach of our laws and should be nowhere near our elections.</p> <p>I was in Tirana at a conference of data privacy commissioners from around the world when Ocasio-Cortez was grilling Zuckerberg. John Edwards, the commissioner for New Zealand, which since the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/christchurch-shooting\" title=\"\">Christchurch massacre </a>has been taking the fight to the tech giants, likened it to \u201cbringing a pocket knife not to a gunfight but to a nuclear explosion\u201d.</p> <p>We know our elections are unsafe. And until Facebook can prove it has fixed that, microtargeted political advertising based on unknown data from unknown sources should simply be banned.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>We know Facebook\u2019s platform was used to subvert and undermine elections in the US, the UK and multiple other countries</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>We are at an extraordinary crossroads. We have sufficient information to know that Facebook\u2019s platform was used to subvert and undermine elections in the US, the UK and many other countries. But we pretend to be helpless to prevent it happening again. We\u2019re not. We\u2019re simply hamstrung by a government and an opposition that have chosen to ignore it. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s bold questions don\u2019t just show Zuckerberg up but Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn also.</p> <p>Our elections are not safe.

      "bodyText": "It was 1am the night before we published the Cambridge Analytica files in March last year and I got an urgent message from my fellow reporter, Emma Graham-Harrison. Facebook, which that day had sent us a letter threatening legal action if we published, had issued a press release saying it had kicked Cambridge Analytica off its platform. It was a last-gasp attempt to get ahead of a story that Facebook knew was set to break. But it was too late. We worked through the night, brought forward our publishing time, and then the story was out there. If this seems like ancient history, it isn\u2019t. Because last week Mark Zuckerberg appeared before the US Congress\u2019s House financial services committee to talk about Facebook\u2019s plans for its Libra cryptocurrency and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the congresswoman for New York\u2019s 14th district, got five minutes to grill him. \u201cMr Zuckerberg, I think you of all people can appreciate using a person\u2019s past behaviour in order to determine, make decisions or predict people\u2019s future behaviour, and in order for us to make decisions about Libra I think we need to kind of dig into your past behaviour and Facebook\u2019s past behaviour with respect to our democracy. Mr Zuckerberg, what year and month did you personally become aware of Cambridge Analytica?\u201d Watching it on a small screen on my phone, I was on the edge of my seat. This was the question that I and a small group of super-nerds, which includes MPs such as Damian Collins and Ian Lucas, have been banging on about for more than a year. Because Zuckerberg last testified to Congress in April 2018 but so many more facts have come to light since. Facts that cast serious doubts over that testimony. Doubts that have opened up a serious question: did he lie on oath to Congress? This is what Ocasio-Cortez was trying to dig into. \u201cI\u2019m not sure of the exact time,\u201d said Zuckerberg. \u201cBut it was probably around the time when it became public, I think it was around March of 2018, I could be wrong.\u201d The problem for Zuckerberg is not that this defies common sense, though it does. It\u2019s that it opens up a whole new world of trouble for Facebook. To understand why, you need to go back to the four days that followed Facebook\u2019s legal threat to us and then its middle-of-the-night press release. Four days in which Facebook\u2019s stock market value plummeted more than $100bn and the company went into lockdown. When Zuckerberg finally emerged, a story was in place. The problem for him is that this has steadily been unravelling ever since. In July this year, a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigation revealed that employees knew that Cambridge Analytica, described as a \u201csketchy\u201d business, had been \u201cscraping\u201d Facebook data in 2015, before even the Guardian\u2019s first report. What about Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg? Ocasio-Cortez asked. When did she know? What about board member Peter Thiel? Zuckerberg drew a blank. His memory banks had nothing. \u201cThis was the largest data scandal with respect to your company that had catastrophic impacts with regard to 2016\u2026 and you don\u2019t know?\u201d asked Ocasio-Cortez. \u201cCongresswoman, we discussed it when we were aware of what happened.\u201d The evidence continues to mount. And the answers Zuckerberg gave Ocasio-Cortez only invite further questions. The fact is that the Cambridge Analytica data scandal is far from over. In some ways, it\u2019s only just beginning. It\u2019s not the crime, as the saying goes, it\u2019s the cover-up. And that continues. Because we know Facebook lied. The SEC investigation says that. To us at the Observer, in fact \u201c\u2026 when asked by reporters in 2017 about its investigation into the Cambridge Analytica matter, Facebook falsely claimed the company found no evidence of wrongdoing\u201d. On 7 November, I will give evidence to the international grand committee of parliamentarians from nine countries who have banded together to try to get answers from Facebook. But Zuckerberg has again refused to give evidence to the representatives of countries numbering more than half a billion people. We have to recognise that Facebook is a foreign company that operates beyond the reach of our laws and should be nowhere near our elections. I was in Tirana at a conference of data privacy commissioners from around the world when Ocasio-Cortez was grilling Zuckerberg. John Edwards, the commissioner for New Zealand, which since the Christchurch massacre has been taking the fight to the tech giants, likened it to \u201cbringing a pocket knife not to a gunfight but to a nuclear explosion\u201d. We know our elections are unsafe. And until Facebook can prove it has fixed that, microtargeted political advertising based on unknown data from unknown sources should simply be banned. We are at an extraordinary crossroads. We have sufficient information to know that Facebook\u2019s platform was used to subvert and undermine elections in the US, the UK and many other countries. But we pretend to be helpless to prevent it happening again. We\u2019re not. We\u2019re simply hamstrung by a government and an opposition that have chosen to ignore it. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s bold questions don\u2019t just show Zuckerberg up but Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn also. Our elections are not safe. And this month Facebook took the decision to make them even more unsafe. Just over a week after Zuckerberg held a closed-door meeting with Donald Trump, we discovered he\u2019d changed Facebook\u2019s policy to allow posts by politicians or parties containing \u201cdeceptive, false or misleading content\u201d. It\u2019s an extraordinary decision championed by Zuckerberg in a speech in which he said: \u201cI believe we must continue to stand for free expression.\u201d Facebook\u2019s global head of policy, Nick Clegg, who once railed against the \u201cblatant lies\u201d told in the European referendum, has now sanctioned their use in all political adverts in all elections in all countries across the world. We\u2019re not helpless. Ocasio-Cortez shows us that. We are just being betrayed by our government and our opposition. \u201cWhy is this lying bastard lying to me?\u201d is a traditional approach to journalism. We in Britain should be asking: why are these lying politicians not taking action over this lying company that is allowing lying politicians to lie to me?",

      "bodyText": "Championship Preston moved up to second after coming back from two goals down against Blackburn in a Lancashire derby. Things could not have started worse for the hosts when they went 1-0 down within 30 seconds when Sam Gallagher\u2019s rebounded off the post and went in via goalkeeper Declan Rudd\u2019s back. Gallagher doubled the lead 10 minutes later but Preston bounced back in the second-half and level things up through Tom Barkhuizen and Daniel Johnson\u2019s penalty. The game was settled in fitting style when Barkhuizen found the top corner from 25 yards. Leeds were the side leapfrogged as they could only muster a goalless draw with Sheffield Wednesday. The points were also shared between West Brom and Charlton, thanks to a 94th minute penalty Josh Cullen penalty, meaning the Baggies are two points clear of Preston. Gary Rowett started his career as Millwall manager with 2-0 victory over former employers Stoke City. James Wallace created the opener with a perfect cross for Ben Thompson to convert and then slotted home a penalty after being felled by Badou N\u2019Diaye. Stoke remain in the relegation zone where they are joined by managerless Barnsley who went behind to Christopher Schindler tap-in from a Karlan Grant cross at Huddersfield. Grant then scored himself, finding the top corner for his eighth goal of the season. Jacob Brown did pull a goal back but the Tykes lie bottom of the table. Completing the relegation zone are Middlesbrough following their 0-0 draw with 10-man Fulham. The result will be particularly disappointing considering visiting goalkeeper Marek Rodak was dismissed in the 17th minute for a handball outside the box. Two Jarrod Bowen strikes earned Hull all three points against Derby. One place above the Tigers sits Birmingham who saw off Luton Town as Lukas Jutkiewicz head home with eight minutes left on the clock. League One Sol Campbell witnessed his new Southend side lose 3-1 at home to first-placed Ipswich Town. James Norwood struck twice and Kayden Jackson got the other with Emile Acquah netting the consolation. The result leaves the two clubs 25 points apart with Paul Lambert\u2019s side joint-top with Wycombe Wanderers. The Chairboys went ahead in the fifth minute when Scott Kashket fired home from the edge of the box at Rotherham. Sunderland were brought back down to earth following their 5-0 midweek victory over Tranmere by losing to a single Jason Cummings goal at Shrewsbury. Mo Eisa earned Peterborough a dramatic draw against Coventry when he hit his 11th of the season in the 95th minute. The result leaves them third, one place above Fleetwood after Ched Evans capitalised on an error from MK Dons goalkeeper Lee Nicholls to prod home the winner with five minutes to go. Fifth place was claimed by Oxford United who brushed aside Rochdale, a task made easier when Aaron Wilbraham was dismissed for a reckless challenge. Portsmouth dropped two points against Bristol Rovers when the a corner hit goalkeeper Craig MacGillivray and bounced into the net. League Two Exeter made the most of Crewe and Cheltenham having their games postponed by beating Plymouth 4-0. Nicky Law struck twice with Tom Parkes and Randell Williams goals sandwiched in between. Swindon won by the same scoreline at Crawley, where Eoin Doyle picked up a hat-trick. Stevenage are off the bottom of the table after captain Scott Cuthbert headed home a late corner against Morecambe, who replaced them at the foot of the table.",

      "body": "<p>Emma Forrest is an acclaimed novelist, screenwriter and director. Born in London in 1976, she got her first break in journalism aged 15 and has since written three novels, <em>Namedropper</em>, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/jul/27/featuresreviews.guardianreview20\" title=\"\">Thin Skin</a></em> and <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/jun/12/fiction.features2\" title=\"\">Cherries in the Snow</a></em>, as well as a memoir, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jan/31/your-voice-my-head-emma-forrest-review\" title=\"\">Your Voice in My Head</a></em>. Her screenplays include <em>Liars (A-E)</em>, <em>Know Your Rights</em> and <em>Love Minus Zero</em>. Her directorial debut, <em>Untogether</em>, premiered at the Tribeca film festival in 2018 and was released in the UK in July this year. Her new novel, <em>Royals</em>, is a love story that explores the power of art and the pull of family ties.</p> <p><strong>What inspired you to write your new book?</strong><br>There was a different novel I\u2019d been working on for about eight years. In the middle of that, when I was still living in LA [she lives in London now], this book started coming to me in dreams. I\u2019ve had ideas in dreams before, but this was coming in consecutive dreams. I also had a useful pressure \u2013 my husband [the actor Ben Mendelsohn] and I were separating. I\u2019d agreed to be packed and out of the house by a certain date and I didn\u2019t even know where I was going to end up living. The house we shared had a little laundry room which turned into my office and I wrote feverishly, over three months. I wanted to write something loving, optimistic and hopeful. With the characters, I took a young gay guy and an heiress and gave them all the love that I didn\u2019t know what to do with.</p> <p><strong>The family dynamics in </strong><em><strong>Royals</strong></em><strong> are fascinating\u2026</strong><br>While I was writing it my grandma was dying. For her whole life she had affected an accent like the Queen or Sybil Fawlty, but towards the end she reverted to her real accent, which was strong Yiddish. She is very present in the characters of the aunties. In the past year, the art that I\u2019ve loved the most has also been about second-generation immigrants and relationships. I really love [Ocean Vuong\u2019s] <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jun/14/on-earth-we-are-briefly-gorgeous-ocean-vuong-review\" title=\"\">On Earth We</a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jun/14/on-earth-we-are-briefly-gorgeous-ocean-vuong-review\" title=\"\">\u2019re Briefly Gorgeou</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jun/14/on-earth-we-are-briefly-gorgeous-ocean-vuong-review\" title=\"\">s</a> \u2013 but I don\u2019t love it any more or less than I love the sitcom <em>Stath Lets Flats</em>; they both address the child\u2019s assimilation compared with the parents\u2019 and they both play with language in a way that someone who has grown up just speaking English doesn\u2019t get \u2013 there\u2019s a precision to the language.</p> <p><strong>The book explores the power of art</strong><strong>. Has it been an influence on you?</strong><br>Three female artists are the biggest influence. My dad took me to see Tracey Emin\u2019s <em>My Bed</em> when I was 12, and I think that\u2019s such a pivotal age. In my early 30s I saw a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/sep/23/kara-walker-turbine-hall-tate-modern-racially-charged\" title=\"\">Kara Walker</a> exhibition in LA with a framed letter to a previous lover. I was alone and had to sit down and gather myself as it was so overwhelming. Finally, Sophie Calle did that unbelievable <a href=\"https://www.perrotin.com/artists/Sophie_Calle/1/take-care-of-yourself-complete-set/12963\" title=\"\">Take Care of Yourself exhibition</a>, based on the break-up letter from her lover. I\u2019ve sat in front of all these works and cried my heart out. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Some books are so alarming you can\u2019t read at night, such as Deborah Levy\u2019s</p> <footer> <cite>Emma Forrest</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>What is your writing process?</strong><br>I\u2019m not embarrassed to say that I do transcendental meditation, which helps my ideas. In my 20s I was blocked. I couldn\u2019t do the one thing I was good at, and that became part of a downward spiral. There\u2019s a Rainer Maria Rilke quote: \u201cThe work of the eyes is done. Go now and do the heart-work on the images imprisoned within you.\u201d I couldn\u2019t live any more with all the images inside me. A huge part of my life throughout my 20s and early 30s was suicidal ideation \u2013 it took a lot of my creativity. When I had my daughter, those ideations stopped. In their vacuum, thank the universe, came writing. I\u2019m so grateful for everything that has helped me be able to sit still and work. I feel like I only figure things out by writing it down.</p> <p>During my marriage to Ben, he supported the household. I had never had the ability not to live in terror of how to pay the rent. It strikes me as unfortunate that my writing was elevated by not having to live in terror of my finances. That was such a huge gift \u2013 it\u2019s awful to write under that anxiety.</p> <p><strong>What are your favourite books?</strong><br>The same way people have day and night creams, I have day and night books. I read <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/30/kudos-rachel-cusk-review-final-part-trilogy\" title=\"\">Rachel Cusk\u2019s trilogy</a> at night because it\u2019s so calm and detached. I felt it reset my circadian rhythms. Then there are books that are so alarming you can\u2019t read them at night, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/deborah-levy\" title=\"\">Deborah Levy\u2019s</a>. One book I was reading alone at night, no longer part of a married couple, with my daughter in the next room, was <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/27/priestdaddy-by-patricia-lockwood-review\" title=\"\">Priestdaddy</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/27/priestdaddy-by-patricia-lockwood-review\" title=\"\"> by Patricia Lo</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/27/priestdaddy-by-patricia-lockwood-review\" title=\"\">ckwood</a>, and I would laugh so hard I was afraid I was becoming deranged, so I switched it to a day book. I also absolutely love Cash Carraway\u2019s memoir, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jul/14/homesick-why-i-live-shed-catrina-davies-skint-estate-cash-carraway-review\" title=\"\">Skint Estate</a></em>.</p> <p>I landed back in England aged 40, having kind of been a child prodigy, and it was a comfort and inspiration to find that all my favourite novels were by middle-aged women who were achieving things and taking their writing to the next level.</p> <p><strong>What books are currently on your bedside table?</strong><br>I just read <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/may/16/animals-emma-jane-unsworth-novel-review\" title=\"\">Adults</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/may/16/animals-emma-jane-unsworth-novel-review\" title=\"\"> by Emma Jane Unsworth</a>, which I loved. When I read <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jun/29/fleishman-is-in-trouble-taffy-brodesser-akner-review\" title=\"\">Fleishman Is </a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jun/29/fleishman-is-in-trouble-taffy-brodesser-akner-review\" title=\"\">in Trouble</a></em> [by Taffy Brodesser-Akner] I felt relief that people were right that it was so good. I\u2019m actually in a book club and got them to read <em>On Earth We</em><em>\u2019re Briefly Gorgeous</em>. I also love <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/murielspark\" title=\"\">Muriel Spark</a>, my north star, and often reread her books.</p> <p><strong>How do you stack your books?</strong><br>There\u2019s a quote from Robert Montgomery: \u201cThe people you love become ghosts inside of you.\u201d I feel like the books we love do too. I have a shelf just of the books my exes gave me. I have many books about M\u0101ori mythology on that shelf. Books have an energetic power \u2013 you can hold them in your hand and know that there\u2019s power.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Royals</em> by Emma Forrest is published by Bloomsbury (\u00a312.99).

Her new novel, Royals, is a love story that explores the power of art and the pull of family ties. What inspired you to write your new book? There was a different novel I\u2019d been working on for about eight years. In the middle of that, when I was still living in LA [she lives in London now], this book started coming to me in dreams. I\u2019ve had ideas in dreams before, but this was coming in consecutive dreams. I also had a useful pressure \u2013 my husband [the actor Ben Mendelsohn] and I were separating. I\u2019d agreed to be packed and out of the house by a certain date and I didn\u2019t even know where I was going to end up living. The house we shared had a little laundry room which turned into my office and I wrote feverishly, over three months. I wanted to write something loving, optimistic and hopeful. With the characters, I took a young gay guy and an heiress and gave them all the love that I didn\u2019t know what to do with. The family dynamics in Royals are fascinating\u2026 While I was writing it my grandma was dying. For her whole life she had affected an accent like the Queen or Sybil Fawlty, but towards the end she reverted to her real accent, which was strong Yiddish. She is very present in the characters of the aunties. In the past year, the art that I\u2019ve loved the most has also been about second-generation immigrants and relationships. I really love [Ocean Vuong\u2019s] On Earth We\u2019re Briefly Gorgeous \u2013 but I don\u2019t love it any more or less than I love the sitcom Stath Lets Flats; they both address the child\u2019s assimilation compared with the parents\u2019 and they both play with language in a way that someone who has grown up just speaking English doesn\u2019t get \u2013 there\u2019s a precision to the language. The book explores the power of art. Has it been an influence on you? Three female artists are the biggest influence. My dad took me to see Tracey Emin\u2019s My Bed when I was 12, and I think that\u2019s such a pivotal age. In my early 30s I saw a Kara Walker exhibition in LA with a framed letter to a previous lover. I was alone and had to sit down and gather myself as it was so overwhelming. Finally, Sophie Calle did that unbelievable Take Care of Yourself exhibition, based on the break-up letter from her lover. I\u2019ve sat in front of all these works and cried my heart out. What is your writing process? I\u2019m not embarrassed to say that I do transcendental meditation, which helps my ideas. In my 20s I was blocked. I couldn\u2019t do the one thing I was good at, and that became part of a downward spiral. There\u2019s a Rainer Maria Rilke quote: \u201cThe work of the eyes is done. Go now and do the heart-work on the images imprisoned within you.\u201d I couldn\u2019t live any more with all the images inside me. A huge part of my life throughout my 20s and early 30s was suicidal ideation \u2013 it took a lot of my creativity. When I had my daughter, those ideations stopped. In their vacuum, thank the universe, came writing. I\u2019m so grateful for everything that has helped me be able to sit still and work. I feel like I only figure things out by writing it down. During my marriage to Ben, he supported the household. I had never had the ability not to live in terror of how to pay the rent. It strikes me as unfortunate that my writing was elevated by not having to live in terror of my finances. That was such a huge gift \u2013 it\u2019s awful to write under that anxiety. What are your favourite books? The same way people have day and night creams, I have day and night books. I read Rachel Cusk\u2019s trilogy at night because it\u2019s so calm and detached. I felt it reset my circadian rhythms. Then there are books that are so alarming you can\u2019t read them at night, such as Deborah Levy\u2019s. One book I was reading alone at night, no longer part of a married couple, with my daughter in the next room, was Priestdaddy by Patricia Lockwood, and I would laugh so hard I was afraid I was becoming deranged, so I switched it to a day book. I also absolutely love Cash Carraway\u2019s memoir, Skint Estate. I landed back in England aged 40, having kind of been a child prodigy, and it was a comfort and inspiration to find that all my favourite novels were by middle-aged women who were achieving things and taking their writing to the next level. What books are currently on your bedside table? I just read Adults by Emma Jane Unsworth, which I loved. When I read Fleishman Is in Trouble [by Taffy Brodesser-Akner] I felt relief that people were right that it was so good. I\u2019m actually in a book club and got them to read On Earth We\u2019re Briefly Gorgeous. I also love Muriel Spark, my north star, and often reread her books. How do you stack your books? There\u2019s a quote from Robert Montgomery: \u201cThe people you love become ghosts inside of you.\u201d I feel like the books we love do too. I have a shelf just of the books my exes gave me. I have many books about M\u0101ori mythology on that shelf. Books have an energetic power \u2013 you can hold them in your hand and know that there\u2019s power. \u2022 Royals by Emma Forrest is published by Bloomsbury (\u00a312.99).

It consists in fellow feeling that puts you upon actually the same level with the fellow who suffers.\u201d</p> <p>Many of the world\u2019s religions share what we call the golden rule: treat others as you want to be treated.

His thesis is that we need to recover our moral purpose of freedom, equality and solidarity \u2013 enshrined in article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights: \u201cAll human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.\u201d Yes! Equal in the eyes of God. This means interdependency, interconnectedness as members of one race \u2013 the human race. We find our joy and human flourishing in company with others. And the rule of law should help us to put all our actions in check.</p> <p>Each statistic conceals a human being.

He walked 10 days through a forest, crossed Iran in the boot of a car, braved the sea in a dinghy at night and endured months in detention. He crossed 10 countries overland, slept under bridges and finally wound up in Italy, where he asked UNHCR how he could be reunited with his brother and sister who were living in the UK. Now he\u2019s in London, training to be a plumber. On the way, he picked up four languages.</p> <p>Farouk could have been murdered, drowned or died of hypothermia in his search for a worthwhile life.

In Christ\u2019s words: \u201cI was a stranger and you welcomed me.\u201d That was in 1974, when I was fleeing the regime of President Idi Amin in Uganda. So I know at first hand what it\u2019s like to depend on the fellow feeling of British people, to be allowed to work for a Cambridge doctorate and to have the privilege of serving in the church\u2019s ministry here for 40 years.</p> <p>Experience tells me the British are not hard-hearted.

Last century, the US president Woodrow Wilson wrote: \u201cBenevolence does not consist in those who are prosperous pitying and helping those who are not. It consists in fellow feeling that puts you upon actually the same level with the fellow who suffers.\u201d Many of the world\u2019s religions share what we call the golden rule: treat others as you want to be treated. It\u2019s a universal template for right behaviour towards one another. Ben Ryan, in his new book How the West Was Lost, compares various nations\u2019 treatment of asylum seekers, reminding us that in 2017 Germany, Austria and Sweden settled more than 3,000 refugees per million of their own population, compared with Britain and Bulgaria with 240 per million. His thesis is that we need to recover our moral purpose of freedom, equality and solidarity \u2013 enshrined in article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights: \u201cAll human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.\u201d Yes! Equal in the eyes of God. This means interdependency, interconnectedness as members of one race \u2013 the human race. We find our joy and human flourishing in company with others. And the rule of law should help us to put all our actions in check. Each statistic conceals a human being. The United Nations Refugee Agency tells the story of Farouk, who, in early 2018, aged 15, fled war in his home country of Afghanistan. He walked 10 days through a forest, crossed Iran in the boot of a car, braved the sea in a dinghy at night and endured months in detention. He crossed 10 countries overland, slept under bridges and finally wound up in Italy, where he asked UNHCR how he could be reunited with his brother and sister who were living in the UK. Now he\u2019s in London, training to be a plumber. On the way, he picked up four languages. Farouk could have been murdered, drowned or died of hypothermia in his search for a worthwhile life. In 2000, 58 migrants suffocated in a lorry in Dover, having set off from China weeks before. Each had paid \u00a320,000 to a Chinese gang. In 2015, the bodies of 71 people were found in an abandoned lorry on an Austrian motorway. Police suspected it was part of a human trafficking operation. There have been thousands of such fatalities this century. Human trafficking is a heinous crime of modern-day slavery. We are all implicated in what some criminals are doing because of our common identity as human beings. Ahmad al-Rashid was an asylum seeker from Syria, who has been reliving the nightmare of his journeys in the back of refrigerator lorries driven by people-smugglers in 2015. Last week, he told BBC News he had been at the mercy of the smugglers and that the trucks were locked from the outside. \u201cIt was a matter of death or life for me,\u201d he said, thinking of the carnage he had escaped in Syria. \u201cIf I go back to that situation at that exact time, the bombing and the shelling and the desperation, I think I would still do it.\u201d Eventually, he was granted asylum and permission for his wife and two daughters to join him in the UK. \u201cI\u2019m extremely lucky because I\u2019m alive and with my family and little angels. My heart goes out to those who lost their lives en route. Be kind, be the voices of the voiceless. Be a human being.\u201d There is a lurking suspicion that if Britain opens the door to more refugees, they will take the jobs of locals and destabilise the country. I think these fears are unfounded. A National Farmers\u2019 Union survey reveals another story. It shows that apple growers have been forced to leave 1,000 tons of fruit unpicked because of a 30% drop in labour. Brussels sprouts, cabbages and cauliflowers are also at risk because of an anticipated labour shortage in the period leading up to Christmas. That\u2019s because foreign workers have left, either through political uncertainty or because better wages are on offer elsewhere. There are unnecessarily bureaucratic obstacles in the path of refugees in the UK, holding them back from working when they are raring to go. Here\u2019s a typical quote from one of them: \u201cI want to work \u2013 I don\u2019t want any more hand-me-downs. I want to enjoy the reward of my sweat. I don\u2019t want to rely on the government\u2019s benefits. I want to work so I can prove myself to my children.\u201d I must declare an interest. In Christ\u2019s words: \u201cI was a stranger and you welcomed me.\u201d That was in 1974, when I was fleeing the regime of President Idi Amin in Uganda. So I know at first hand what it\u2019s like to depend on the fellow feeling of British people, to be allowed to work for a Cambridge doctorate and to have the privilege of serving in the church\u2019s ministry here for 40 years. Experience tells me the British are not hard-hearted. We just need to turn today\u2019s sentiments of sadness into a national policy of welcome. Becoming people with cool heads and warm hearts. \u2022 The Most Rev John Sentamu is the archbishop of York",

      "bodyText": "The MSNBC host Rachel Maddow has launched a stinging attack on her own bosses, accusing senior news executives at parent company NBC of being \u201ccomplicit in shielding\u201d Harvey Weinstein and Matt Lauer from accusations of sexual misconduct. Maddow told viewers NBC management allowed Ronan Farrow\u2019s reporting on Weinstein to \u201cget away\u201d, after Farrow took his work on the major #MeToo-era cases to the New Yorker, from where he won a Pulitzer prize. \u201cIt would be impossible for me to overstate the amount of consternation in this building,\u201d Maddow said. \u201cThe allegations about the behavior of Harvey Weinstein and Matt Lauer are gut-wrenching at baseline, no matter who you are or what your connection is to this story. \u201cBut accusations that people in positions of authority in this building may have been complicit in some way of shielding those guys from accountability, those accusations are very, very hard to stomach.\u201d This month, Farrow published Catch and Kill, a book which details his work on high-profile stories at the heart of the #MeToo era, exposing prominent men, often in the media, to allegations of sexual harrassment, misconduct and assault. The author has accused executives, including the NBC News president Noah Oppenheim, of knowing about allegations against Lauer but failing to act on them before the anchor was fired in November 2017. Oppenheim has rejected the claim and denied accusers were handed \u201cenhanced severance payouts\u201d in exchange for silence. \u201cNot only is this false, the so-called evidence Farrow uses in his book to support the charge collapses under the slightest scrutiny,\u201d Oppenheim wrote to NBC staff, rejecting the allegation reporting on Weinstein was squashed to protect Lauer. Maddow\u2019s outburst came as NBC announced it would release former employees from non-disclosure agreements. \u201cAny former NBC News employee who believes that they cannot disclose their experience with sexual harassment as a result of a confidentiality or non-disparagement provision in their separation agreement should contact NBC Universal and we will release them from that perceived obligation,\u201d a statement read. Speaking on Maddow\u2019s show, Farrow said the network deserved praise for the decision and that many women he had spoken to while writing his book \u201cfelt constrained\u201d and \u201cagonized\u201d by confidentially agreements. \u201cI think this will go a long way towards making them feel that they can discuss this openly,\u201d he said. Farrow has maintained that NBC executives ordered him to stop reporting on Weinstein\u2019s alleged behaviour because Weinstein threatened to expose allegations of sexual misconduct against Lauer, who was subsequently accused of raping an NBC staffer at the 2014 winter Olympics. Weinstein and Lauer deny all allegations of non-consensual sex. Farrow maintains that senior executives at NBC knew of the allegations against Lauer and the \u201cenhanced\u201d severance payments. \u201cThis is a documented pattern of secret settlements in this company,\u201d he told Maddow.",

We\u2019ve got <strike> loads of 3pm games </strike> just three Premier League matches kicking off at 3pm today. Thanks Europa League! Who knows, though, we could have 27 goals if we see three repeats of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/25/southampton-leicester-premier-league-match-report\">last night\u2019s ridiculous scoreline at Southampton</a>. Marco Silva gave himself some room to breathe last weekend as his Everton side impressed in a 2-0 home win over West Ham. <strong>Everton</strong> travel to <strong>Brighton</strong> this afternoon looking to build on that win. The Seagulls went down 2-1 to Aston Villa last weekend after having Aaron Mooy sent off in the first half but in their last home match they demolished Spurs 3-0 and will hope to get on the front foot against the Toffees, who haven\u2019t won away in the league this season. </p> <p>We also have what might be a spicy match at the London Stadium, where <strong>West Ham </strong>take on <strong>Sheffield United</strong>. The Blades hate the Hammers because they believe Carlos Tevez, who relegated them in 2007 after scoring the winning goal against Manchester United at Old Trafford, should not have been eligible to play for them. Jacob Steinberg goes into greater detail about the bad blood in this fine piece of writing here:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/25/west-ham-carlos-tevez-javier-mascherano-sheffield-united-premier-league\">Signing of Tevez and Mascherano nearly burst West Ham\u2019s bubble</a> </p> </aside>  <p>After a fine start to the season, West Ham aren\u2019t playing well and are in danger of going into freefall having not won a game for over a month. The Blades, meanwhile, are going to bounce into the capital full of beans after beating Arsenal on Monday. </p> <p>Bournemouth travel to rock-bottom and winless Watford in the last of the 3pm Premier League games. I fancy them to end that run against the Cherries. Watford were great against Spurs last weekend and deserved to take three points away from north London. Bournemouth haven\u2019t won since 20 September, when they won 3-1 at Southampton, a result that looks modest after Leicester\u2019s evisceration of the Saints. And that\u2019s your lot for the English top flight. </p> <p>I\u2019ll keep a close eye on goings on across the Football League and anything of interest in Europe, too. With <strong>Leeds</strong> currently in action at <strong>Sheffield Wednesday</strong>, Championship high-flyers <strong>West Brom</strong> will hope to beat mid-table <strong>Charlton</strong> to pull clear at the top. </p> <p>And if you\u2019re wondering who could have a worse weekend than Southampton, what about <strong>Southend</strong>? <strong>Sol Campbell </strong>officially takes charge of the League One club today in their home match against joint-top Ipswich having watched them lose 7-1 at home to Doncaster on Tuesday. </p> <p>In the <strong>Scottish Premiership</strong> (which already looks like a two-horse race), Rangers and Celtic both play tomorrow, having been in Europa League action on Thursday. If you want to check today\u2019s fixtures across Europe in all the leading leagues, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/fixtures\">use this handy link</a>. </p> <p>And I\u2019m a firm believer that the yellow ball above is rubbish. A winter football should be an orange Adidas Tango or nothing else. Also, they shouldn\u2019t be allowed to use a winter ball until after the clocks go back. Thoughts? </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-26T12:46:37.265Z\">at 1.46pm BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "And that\u2019s your lot. Be sure to join Rob Smyth for Burnley v Chelsea. Bye. Bayern are top of Bundesliga, as they always are. But Juventus\u2019s slip up at Lecce has given Inter the chance to go top of Serie A. It\u2019s the tale of Watford 0-0 Bournemouth, in which Ben Foster was a giant among men. Everton\u2019s Twitter feed sums up the general dark mood of Toffees after that defeat, in which they actually played the better football and were more than good value for a point. Here\u2019s Jacob Steinberg\u2019s report from the London Stadium. Here\u2019s Paul Doyle\u2019s report on a dramatic late win for the Seagulls at the Amex Stadium. Hibernian 2-2 Ross County Kilmarnock 1-0 St Mirren Livingston 0-0 Hearts St Johnstone 3-2 Hamilton Exeter 4-0 Plymouth Colchester 3-1 Newport Crawley 0-4 Swindon Leyton Orient 1-1 Carlisle Northampton 2-0 Cambridge Port Vale 0-0 Oldham Salford 1-1 Scunthorpe Stevenage 1-0 Morecambe Walsall 1-2 Mansfield Accrington 0-1 Gillingham Bristol Rovers 2-2 Portsmouth Burton A 0-0 Blackpool Fleetwood 1-0 MK Dons Oxford Utd 3-0 Rochdale Peterborough 2-2 Coventry Rotherham 0-1 Wycombe Shrewsbury 1-0 Sunderland Southend 1-3 Ipswich Birmingham 2-1 Luton Huddersfield 2-1 Barnsley Hull 2-0 Derby Middlesbrough 0-0 Fulham (well, what other score was it going to be?) Millwall 2-0 Stoke Preston 3-2 Blackburn West Brom 2-2 Charlton Preston are up to second. What a comeback that was! Brighton 3-2 Everton Watford 0-0 Bournemouth West Ham 1-1 Sheffield United That doesn\u2019t make pretty viewing for Everton and Manchester United fans. Championship: A late Charlton penalty has pegged West Brom back. They\u2019ve drawn 2-2. The Baggies are still top, but by two points instead of four. \u201cThanks for jinxing the Baggies victory,\u201d snipes JR in Illionois. Soz. It\u2019s all over. Digne trudges off looking crestfallen after handing three points to Brighton in a rollicking game. It\u2019s certainly the day\u2019s most entertaining, not that it had much competition. Epic stuff. Oh Lucas! Oh Everton! Oh Marco! That\u2019s three points for the Seagulls. Scenes at the Amex as Digne slides in to convert a low cross into his own net like a seasoned striker! It\u2019s another fine result for Chris Wilder\u2019s side. A deserved point thanks to Lys Mousset, who leapt off the bench to score his second goal this week to level the match in the second half. West Ham are still winless sine 22 September. Here\u2019s what\u2019s going on at Vicarage Road, where it\u2019s 0-0. Southend have got a goal back against Ipswich. Is the Sol-inspired comeback on? Given it\u2019s the 90th minute, not likely. Jordan Pickford is having one of those games for Everton. Having been at fault for Brighton\u2019s first goal, Gross\u2019s free-kick, he\u2019s just parried another one straight back into the middle of the penalty area when it looked for all the world like it should be a routine save. He\u2019s like a kid who\u2019s drunk too many sugary drinks at times. Far too jumpy. Championship: It\u2019s still 0-0 at Middlesbrough, where 10-man Fulham are holding out quite comfortably. Thousands of home fans have already gone home to get their kicks watching paint dry. Championship: Preston have come back from 2-0 down against Blackburn to lead 3-2. Barkhuizen has scored his second \u2013 and it\u2019s a delightful 20-yarder by all accounts. And West Brom are down to 10 men but have taken the lead against Charlton through Robson-Kanu. They\u2019re going four points clear! League One: It\u2019s Southend 0-3 Ipswich. Those Sol Campbell programmes might not be collectors\u2019 items after all. Are Fort William trying to \u201cHassenhutl\u201d it up against Albion Rovers? They\u2019re 5-0 down at home. Four more to go, lads. Neal Maupay bangs it straight down the middle. It\u2019s all square! Keane is adjudged to have stood on Connolly\u2019s foot and Brighton have a spot-kick! Everton are livid. They think it was soft. West Ham could, and probably should, be 2-1 up. Snodgrass slides Gazza at Euro 96-style towards a low cross, but he can\u2019t wrap his foot round it. League One: It\u2019s Southend 0-2 Ipswich. Oh Sol! And the substitute scores immediately. What an impact. What a substitution. Calvert-Lewin pounces to slide home from close range. Marco has got his magic back. Marco Silva has made a double-change as he tries to squeeze a winner out of his Everton side at Brighton. Calvert-Lewin and Delph are both on. Championship: Harry Cornick has leapt off the bench to score an equaliser for Luton at Birmingham . Harry Wilson is on for Bournemouth at Vicarage Road. Surely a free-kick is now the best chance of seeing a goal in that game. There\u2019s a supporter on as a fourth official at Southend. How neutral can he really be? It\u2019s still only 1-0 to Ipswich. Can Sol Campbell work his magic for the Shrimpers? Championship: Preston have battled back from 2-0 down against Blackburn and have levelled the match up at 2-2 thanks to goals from Tom Barkhuizen and Daniel Johnson, who just held his nerve to score from the penalty spot. The Blades are level. And it\u2019s Mousset, the man who scored the winner against Arsenal, who has come off the bench to score it, steering a right footed volley into the far corner. Pascal Gross has stabbed the ball home for Brighton \u2026 but he\u2019s flagged for offside. It\u2019s still 1-1 with Everton. Championship: Charlton have equalised against West Brom. Macauley Bonne has nodded home. It\u2019s 1-1. The Ideal Boiler mascot will be gutted! Karlan Grant has given Huddersfield a 2-0 lead against rock-bottom Barnsley. It\u2019s his seventh of the season. He\u2019s been so important this season. Serie A: Lecce have held Juventus to a 1-1 draw so Inter can go top if they beat Parma at home later. There have been some fun and games in Croatia this afternoon. Hajduk Split won 2-0. Can\u2019t imagine Slaven Belupo took it well. West Ham waste a three-on-two attack! Yarmolenko plays a lovely ball into Anderson who shoots straight at Henderson instead of squaring to Haller, who had an open goal. Will they regret that? Action at Vicarage Road! Action at Vicarage Road! There\u2019s almost a goal. Delufeu has a close-range stab at goal but Ramsdale does a Schmeichel-style star jump in front of him and deflects the ball wide for a corner. It\u2019s the second half in matches up and down the UK. There was quite the goal in the National League game between Stockport and Dover. We need footage of this. You know what, it might look like this: Scotland\u2019s not exactly raining goals, either: Hibernian 0-0 Ross County Kilmarnock 0-0 St Mirren Livingston 0-0 Hearts St Johnstone 1-1 Hamilton There aren\u2019t many goals around are there? Maybe it\u2019s the weather \u2013 or perhaps Leicester just took up the weekend\u2019s entire goals quota last night. Colchester 2-1 Newport Crawley 0-2 Swindon Leyton Orient 1-0 Carlisle Northampton 2-0 Cambridge Port Vale 0-0 Oldham Salford 1-1 Scunthorpe Stevenage 0-0 Morecambe Walsall 1-1 Mansfield Accrington 0-0 Gillingham Bristol Rovers 0-1 Portsmouth Burton Albion 0-0 Blackpool Fleetwood 0-0 MK Dons Oxford Utd 2-0 Rochdale Peterborough 0-1 Coventry Rotherham 0-1 Wycombe Shrewsbury 1-0 Sunderland Southend 0-1 Ipswich Birmingham 1-0 Luton Huddersfield 1-0 Barnsley Hull City 0-0 Derby Middlesbrough 0-0 Fulham Millwall 1-0 Stoke Preston 0-2 Blackburn West brom 1-0 Charlton I\u2019m not a betting man, but if I was, I\u2019d sell my house and put all the money on a 0-0 draw at Boro. Brighton 1-1 Everton Watford 0-0 Bournemouth West Ham 1-0 Sheffield United Lecce have equalised against Juventus. They\u2019re drawing 1-1. If they can hold on that would be some result. It would also give Inter the chance to go top in the late kick-off. What\u2019s happening at Watford v Bournemouth, you ask? Nothing. Nothing is happening. Well, that\u2019s blunted the Blades. Sheffield United fail to deal with a long ball forwards. Yarmolenko plays a simple square pass to Snodgrass, who races into the box and finishes clinically with his left foot. Lundstram has hooked a left-footed shot a few inches wide after a smart attack by the Blades at the London Stadium. They\u2019re finishing the half the stronger side. Ryan is having a solid game for Brighton. He\u2019s just got across smartly to prevent Everton taking a 2-1 lead after a shot deflected off Webster and looked to be heading into the corner of his goal only for him to stretch his long frame to get his hands to it. Half-time scores from the Bundesliga: Bayern 1-0 Union Berlin Freiburg 1-0 Leipzig Hertha Berlin 0-2 Hoffenheim Paderborn 1-0 Fortuna Dusseldorf Schalke 0-0 Dortmund Championship: Fulham are down to 10 men at Middlesbrough. If ever there was a chance for Boro to end their six-game winless run, it\u2019s today. they just don\u2019t score many goals, though. One of Everton\u2019s best players this season has been Bernard, but the poor chap has done himself some harm and may be out for some time. Just as I post that last update from east London, Sheffield United almost take the lead against the run of play. The ball bounced across McGoldrick in the six-yard box, who flicks a leg out and diverts the ball towards goal, where Roberto scrambles it away. Good save. West Ham are all over Sheffield United at the London Stadium but they haven\u2019t found a way through the Blades\u2019 defence yet. Pellegrini will be happy with the way his side are dominating possession, though. They\u2019ll have to be patient. League One: Shrewsbury have taken a 1-0 lead against Sunderland thanks to Jason Cummings and Oxford Utd are 1-0 up against Rochdale. Southend are still only 1-0 down to Ipswich too. The Sol effect! Walcott has a great chance to put Everton 2-1 up but Ryan is out off his line quickly to block the shot at the far post. The angle was against Walcott. It wasn\u2019t the easiest chance. A good response by Everton, though. Silva will be delighted. Well, that didn\u2019t last long. A simple corner to the near post that Richarlison heads against Webster and into the bottom corner. It may go down as an own goal. There\u2019s a VAR check on it but it will be given. Brighton are in control at the Amex. They\u2019re bossing possession with some lovely little triangular passing in midfield. \u201cThat burnt-orange Tango Rosario is truly a sight to behold. I would frame a giant photo print of the thing and hang it on the living room wall if the missus would let me,\u201d writes Peter Oh. \u201cAbout your quip that Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl should get the LMA Performance of the Week award. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has two more points than Hasenh\u00fcttl.\u201d Honk! Pascal Gross has belted a 20-yard free-kick past Pickford to give the Seagulls the lead! It went through Pickford\u2019s hands. He won\u2019t be happy with that. It was struck firmly but the keeper should be able to deflect that away. Championship: Matt Philips has put West Brom 1-0 up against Charlton. The ball deflected off his heel and into the top corner. Not a bad place for it to end up. There are still no goals in the Premier League. This was never going to be a classic clocko, was it? One for the purists. Watford have suffered an injury blow in their match against Bournemouth. Tom Cleverley has twanged a muscle and Will Hughes is on inhis stead. League One: Oh Sol! It\u2019s Southend 0-1 Ipswich. They held out for eight minutes and then James Norwood struck. The Shrimpers have shipped 24 goals in seven games. Oof! Declan Rudd has given Blackburn a 1-0 lead at Preston. That\u2019s a long time to hold on at Deepdale, mind. It\u2019s ended Exeter 4-0 Plymouth in the Scrumpy Jack derby. That\u2019s an impressive win \u2013 and it\u2019s lifted Exeter up to second in League Two. The 3pm kick-offs are under way! West Ham really should wheel Carlos Tevez out to do the half-time raffle in the match against Sheffield United today. It\u2019d spice the atmosphere up a bit. Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich are 1-0 up against the league\u2019s hippest club, Union Berlin. Benjamin Pavard scored the goal. Dortmund are being held at Schalke but there\u2019s plenty of time left yet. There\u2019s a special \u201cSol Campbell\u201d edition match programme at Roots Hall. Get yours now! Here\u2019s Jamie Jackson\u2019s match report from the Etihad, where Manchester City eventually cruised to a 3-0 win over Aston Villa: Chris Wilder has won an award which I believe they have just made up this season. It\u2019s called the LMA Performance of the Week award. Sheffield United\u2019s 1-0 win over Arsenal was deemed good enough for Wilder to receive said gong. They should really give it to Ralph Hassenhutl next week. It\u2019s a great result for West Brom, who kick-off against Charlton top of the Championship. A number of Football League games have been washed off today by biblical rain in the midlands and north-west of England. Here\u2019s an up-to-date list: Nottingham Forest v Reading Tranmere v Doncaster Lincoln v Bolton Forest Green v Crewe Grimsby v Cheltenham Macclesfield v Bradford Here\u2019s a picture of the only ball that should be used in winter months - not least because if it actually snows you can still see the thing, unlike the diabolical yellow one. Peep! It\u2019s all over at the Etihad. And here\u2019s how the Premier League table looks before the 3pm kick-offs. Manchester City are cruising to a 3-0 win against Aston Villa, though Fernandinho has managed to get himself sent off, which will give Pep Guardiola another headache/exciting tactical puzzle to solve in the coming weeks. Watford: Foster, Dawson, Cathcart, Kabasele, Janmaat, Cleverley, Chalobah, Doucoure, Masina, Deulofeu, Pereyra. Subs: Gomes, Prodl, Mariappa, Gray, Hughes, Quina, Foulquier. Bournemouth: Ramsdale, Smith, Steve Cook, Ake, Rico, Danjuma, Lerma, Billing, Fraser, Callum Wilson, King. Subs: Boruc, Francis, Solanke, Lewis Cook, Harry Wilson, Kelly, Mepham. Referee: Mike \u2018the Tranmere ultra\u2019 Dean (Wirral) Watford make two changes. Holebas, who is suspended, is replaced by Masina. And Deulofeu replaces the injured Welbeck. Danjuma, King and Lerma come in for Bournemouth. West Ham: Roberto, Zabaleta, Diop, Balbuena, Cresswell, Rice, Yarmolenko, Noble, Snodgrass, Felipe Anderson, Haller. Subs: Lanzini, Sanchez, Fornals, Ogbonna, Fredericks, Martin, Ajeti. Sheff Utd: Henderson, Basham, Egan, O\u2019Connell, Baldock, Lundstram, Norwood, Fleck, Stevens, McGoldrick, Robinson. Subs: Luke Freeman, McBurnie, Sharp, Jagielka, Mousset, Moore, Besic. Referee: David Coote (Nottinghamshire) Manuel Pellegrini has taken an axe to his West Ham team after the defeat at Everton. He\u2019s made five changes. Angelo Ogbonna, who was so influential in defence at the start of the season, is one of the casualties. Lanzini and Fornals also join him on the bench. Lys Mousset, who scored the winner against Arsenal, is on the Sheffield United bench today. He\u2019s replaced by Callum Robinson. Brighton: Ryan, Montoya, Webster, Dunk, Burn, Gross, Propper, Stephens, Alzate, Connolly, Maupay. Subs: Bissouma, Trossard, Balogun, Murray, March, Schelotto, Button. Everton: Pickford, Sidibe, Keane, Holgate, Digne, Andre Gomes, Davies, Walcott, Iwobi, Bernard, Richarlison. Subs: Delph, Calvert-Lewin, Sigurdsson, Schneiderlin, Coleman, Kean, Lossl. Referee: Andrew Madley (West Yorkshire) Mason Holgate is in for the injured Yerry Mina as Silva sticks with the Everton midfield and forwards who were so effective against West Ham. The 21-year-old Steven Alzate replaces the suspended Aaron Mooy in Brighton\u2019s midfield. With Liverpool not in action until their home game against Spurs tomorrow, Manchester City can close the gap at the top to three points. They Premier League champions are currently beating Aston Villa 2-0. You can follow it with Rob Smyth here: And if you want to keep an eye on what is going on in the Yorkshire scrap between second-placed Leeds and third-placed Sheffield Wednesday in the Championship, click this here link for a live match centre, including handy stats and everything. Afternoon. We\u2019ve got loads of 3pm games just three Premier League matches kicking off at 3pm today. Thanks Europa League! Who knows, though, we could have 27 goals if we see three repeats of last night\u2019s ridiculous scoreline at Southampton. Marco Silva gave himself some room to breathe last weekend as his Everton side impressed in a 2-0 home win over West Ham. Everton travel to Brighton this afternoon looking to build on that win. The Seagulls went down 2-1 to Aston Villa last weekend after having Aaron Mooy sent off in the first half but in their last home match they demolished Spurs 3-0 and will hope to get on the front foot against the Toffees, who haven\u2019t won away in the league this season. We also have what might be a spicy match at the London Stadium, where West Ham take on Sheffield United. The Blades hate the Hammers because they believe Carlos Tevez, who relegated them in 2007 after scoring the winning goal against Manchester United at Old Trafford, should not have been eligible to play for them. Jacob Steinberg goes into greater detail about the bad blood in this fine piece of writing here: After a fine start to the season, West Ham aren\u2019t playing well and are in danger of going into freefall having not won a game for over a month. The Blades, meanwhile, are going to bounce into the capital full of beans after beating Arsenal on Monday. Bournemouth travel to rock-bottom and winless Watford in the last of the 3pm Premier League games. I fancy them to end that run against the Cherries. Watford were great against Spurs last weekend and deserved to take three points away from north London. Bournemouth haven\u2019t won since 20 September, when they won 3-1 at Southampton, a result that looks modest after Leicester\u2019s evisceration of the Saints. And that\u2019s your lot for the English top flight. I\u2019ll keep a close eye on goings on across the Football League and anything of interest in Europe, too. With Leeds currently in action at Sheffield Wednesday, Championship high-flyers West Brom will hope to beat mid-table Charlton to pull clear at the top. And if you\u2019re wondering who could have a worse weekend than Southampton, what about Southend? Sol Campbell officially takes charge of the League One club today in their home match against joint-top Ipswich having watched them lose 7-1 at home to Doncaster on Tuesday. In the Scottish Premiership (which already looks like a two-horse race), Rangers and Celtic both play tomorrow, having been in Europa League action on Thursday. If you want to check today\u2019s fixtures across Europe in all the leading leagues, use this handy link. And I\u2019m a firm believer that the yellow ball above is rubbish. A winter football should be an orange Adidas Tango or nothing else. Also, they shouldn\u2019t be allowed to use a winter ball until after the clocks go back. Thoughts?",

In Germany, companies such as R\u00e4ubersachen allow parents to rent individual items such as winter coats and sleeping bags, which can become particularly pricey when used for only a short time. \u201cWool clothes are expensive, so it\u2019s better to borrow,\u201d said Kasia Reszel, who has a year-old son. \u201cThat way, I don\u2019t spend as much and he can have different jumpers every few months.\u201d Reszel, who works fulltime as a teacher in Berlin, said that although parent groups, for example on Facebook, enabled her to buy secondhand or make money from selling baby clothes, she did not have the time to relist items. \u201cI don\u2019t want to invest in things I won\u2019t have time to sell later,\u201d she said, \u201cand I don\u2019t plan on having any more babies, so what\u2019s the point in keeping them?\u201d In today\u2019s ever-smaller living spaces, keeping old clothes is often not an option. \u201cI live in a small flat and I don\u2019t have space to be sentimental,\u201d said Jones-Walter. \u201cI\u2019d love to keep them and look back in 30 years but we don\u2019t have room to do that.\u201d",

This is Blunt\u2019s industry. How could he not know this? Even if he\u2019s established enough not to feel the effects, why is he so insensitive to others? But then, while he didn\u2019t go to Eton, he went to (ta-da!) Harrow. Clearly when he said that \u201cour lives won\u2019t change\u201d, what he really meant was \u201cmy life won\u2019t change\u201d. In recent years, Blunt has made the odd self-deprecating quip that made him appear witty and \u201cblokey\u201d. But when it comes down to it, here he is: just another posh berk who has no idea and, crucially, couldn\u2019t care less what impact (multifaceted, relentless and devastating) Brexit would have on ordinary people and ordinary artists. Thanks, Rory Stewart \u2013 you\u2019ve shown your true colours Should former Tory Rory Stewart barricade himself indoors \u2013 for the sake of his campaign to be London mayor? Stewart described three young black men he filmed in east London while campaigning to be Tory leader as \u201cminor gangsters\u201d. He said: \u201cI can go to Brick Lane and three sort of minor gangsters can come up to me and spend a minute telling me I\u2019m an idiot.\u201d Smashing. Except why were they \u201cminor gangsters\u201d \u2013 would Stewart have said this about white men? All they did was calmly decline to be interviewed, because they \u201cdidn\u2019t fuck with politics\u201d. Otherwise, they were charming and friendly, chatting about being from Dublin, with one saying \u201cpeace, bro\u201d as he left. It turns out that the trio are a rap group called Hare Squead, who later described Stewart as \u201clooking a bit fucking creepy\u201d and a \u201ccorny, goofy-looking man\u201d. They also said his depiction of them was racist and that he should apologise. (Stewart did apologise on Twitter.) This was even more unacceptable in the week that official figures showed that black, Asian and minority ethnic people were still four times more likely to be subjected to a police stop and search. Note to Stewart: not all black men are \u201cminor gangsters\u201d, but too many are treated that way, even by self-styled \u201cstreetwise\u201d politicians. \u2022 Barbara Ellen is an Observer columnist",

There are campaigns to keep TV licences free for the 3.7 million aged over 75 while the BBC, which is currently suffering huge cuts to the finance needed to cover most of that \u00a3750m cost, should remain well funded to maintain its role as a cornerstone of British values. The eclectic and long wish list goes on and on, spanning calls for a sophisticated border force ready to keep out illegal immigrants and a national superfast broadband network to making sure that the Royal Navy, which has admitted that a quarter of its 76 ships are unseaworthy, has enough money to refit them. These bills add up to hundreds of billions of pounds over the next 20 years, a period when the population will age and Brexit will chase away many of those companies that have stationed themselves in the UK exactly to benefit from access to the EU. This is all before we have reviewed the broader welfare system and decided how much more money it needs to provide a decent living for disabled people, the elderly and those unable to find work. Such is the shortfall between what we want and what we can afford that something needs to give. We can tax more or borrow more or work harder and produce more stuff to sell.

Javid said last month he would spend around \u00a313.8bn extra a year, restoring the police and schools budgets to something near to their previous peaks. He has pledged to increase spending on infrastructure and has backed higher spending on health, increasing the NHS budget by \u00a320bn over a decade. But he knows this just scratches the surface of what is needed to make up for nine years of austerity and to keep pace with developments in the digital age. The Tory plan is to limit public spending on infrastructure to the bare minimum, leaving the bulk of the upgrade to the private sector. In the 21st century, that means leaving the building of nuclear power stations to the French, digital infrastructure to the Americans and Chinese, and steel manufacture to the Turkish military pension fund currently in the throes of buying British Steel. These foreign owners want two concessions: firstly to pay zero corporate taxes and, when they provide domestic services, charge a whopping rent. All of this might be affordable if we weren\u2019t paying such high rents to the owners of Britain\u2019s land and property. The US, France and Germany have their property hotspots, yet most of the land remains cheap and rents in large cities can be still be affordable. In the UK, we are all shelling out huge sums on rent and mortgages that could be used to pay tax on collective goods and services, or to buy those goods and services directly. In 2017, the total amount of rent paid by tenants in Britain soared to more than \u00a350bn, more than double the level seen a decade ago. The total level of mortgage payments has changed little in that time, as the old pay off their loans and own homes outright, while the young take on bigger loans over longer periods to pay ever higher property prices. It\u2019s easy to see why the left dodges the issue of rent when so many voters are either landlords themselves, invest in property or think property will one day be their financial saviour.

It describes a dangerous journey into a forbidden territory called the Zone, on which a writer and a scientist are guided by the eponymous Stalker. They are seeking \u201cthe room\u201d, a place where your innermost desires are granted, which may not be a good thing. Death and suicide are among the consequences for at least some of those who reach it. Be careful what you wish for, you might say.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a bit strange,\u201d muses the architect <a href=\"http://www.adamrichards.co.uk/about\" title=\"\">Adam Richards</a>, \u201cto base a house on such a bleak film.\u201d Indeed. Such, though, is exactly what he has done with <a href=\"http://adamrichards.co.uk/projects/nithurst-farm\" title=\"\">Nithurst Farm</a>, the sweetly named house he has designed for himself and his family in the soft, green, gently grand landscape of West Sussex. The building has been shortlisted for the RIBA House of the Year award, the winner of which will be unveiled on Channel 4\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.channel4.com/programmes/grand-designs\" title=\"\">Grand Designs</a></em><a href=\"https://www.channel4.com/programmes/grand-designs\" title=\"\"> </a>on 13 November.</p> <p>Richards, who is best known up to now for his sensitive additions to the <a href=\"http://www.ditchlingmuseumartcraft.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Ditchling Museum of Art and Craft</a> in East Sussex, has created a big hall that recalls a cathedral-like space that Tarkovsky\u2019s pilgrims enter before they reach the room. It is finished in raw concrete, in emulation of the post-industrial aesthetic that <em>Stalker </em>(before <em>Blade Runner</em>, for example, riffed on comparable themes) helped to pioneer. The hall is a bit mysterious, with rectangular towers cutting into its trapezoidal outline, such that you can\u2019t take in the whole space at once. Light comes round corners, through windows you can\u2019t see when you first enter the room.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9fd0e20b6984346f1b9c2a5ce5bffa263e6c2612\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9fd0e20b6984346f1b9c2a5ce5bffa263e6c2612/0_0_6732_4710/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nithurst Farm\u2019s \u2018stonking\u2019 hall.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"700\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The kitchen area of Nithurst Farm\u2019s \u2018stonking\u2019 hall.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 Brotherton Lock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The hall, to put it in practical terms, contains the kitchen, a dining area and a raised children\u2019s play zone; the towers contain supporting functions such as a utility room and a larder. At the far end, dead on the axis of what is a mostly symmetrical space, you enter a tight little passageway. You are then obliged to turn off the axis, left and then right, up a few steps, into the well-proportioned living room, filled with south light from high windows. A somewhat deadpan fireplace, which turns out to be the thing you circumnavigated on your way into the room, faces the glass; above it hangs a photograph by Simon Norfolk of the <a href=\"http://www.simonnorfolk.com/technologies/tech-10\" title=\"\">Large Hadron Collider</a>. Fire plus atom-smasher: two versions of energy, you might say.</p> <p>This living room, according to Richards\u2019s Tarkovskian conceit, which has been reached in a spatially roundabout way, is the one where your desires come true. There are other ideas, meanwhile, dancing around in what is a regular party of inspirations. The hall has a debt to those of large medieval houses, where all human and animal life went on. The concrete oblongs owe something, Richards says, to enigmatic objects that appear in the drawings of the Renaissance Dutch perspectivist <a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c0/Hans_Vredeman_de_Vries_and_Gillis_Mostaert_-_The_Sacrifice_at_Lystra.jpg\" title=\"\">Hans Vredeman de Vries</a>. The interrupted axis on the way from the hall to the living room is a device from Edwin Lutyens. On the upper floors of the house, behind what looks like a cupboard door, a staircase ascends to the light, in emulation of the <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/277303809\" title=\"\">celestial steps</a> in Powell and Pressburger\u2019s 1946 film <em>A Matter of Life and Death.</em></p> <p>All of which allusiveness could amount to little more than diverting chatter. Or, worse, a pretentious intellectual dressing to a design that may or may not have substance. The great thing about Nithurst Farm is that there is very much a there there. It is physically engaging and intriguing, the ferment of ideas having translated into a sort of compressed mineral energy. The building has both heft and bounce. Its weighty masonry seems always on the verge of springing into life.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4fb3bcb572ac3751e8971f4ad9a78ff84a59b94e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4fb3bcb572ac3751e8971f4ad9a78ff84a59b94e/0_0_4961_5457/909.jpg\" alt=\"The celestial staircase\u2026\" width=\"909\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The celestial staircase\u2026</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 Brotherton Lock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Seen from a distance, approached down a slope from the nearest road, the house aspires to an antiquity beyond that of the traditional farmyard buildings among which it sits. With big, semicircular details, the depth of their brick reveals exaggerated for effect, it\u2019s like (another allusion) a Roman ruin. At the same time the arches scatter across the elevation with nervy irregularity, the one at the top-left corner seeming to want to float away from its position altogether. To the sides of the windows are horizontal smudges of darker brickwork, which Richards says derive from the blurs that cartoonists apply to figures, to signify movement.</p> <p>The profile of the building is stepped, echoing the slope of a hill behind, while adding to the general sense of mass in motion. The house, though, is not about to jump out of your way: you have to walk round it, in search of a deliberately underplayed blunt rectangle of a front door. This is all part of the game of offer and denial that runs through the project.</p> <p>There are other subtleties. The mortar is unusually thick, such that you don\u2019t know if you\u2019re looking at little bricks or large joints, part of an ongoing ambiguity of scale. Sometimes the house seems smaller than it really is, sometimes bigger. What looks like rigid symmetry running down the spine of the house is undercut by varying window sill heights on either side, which set up contrasting relationships to the landscape outside. The materials \u2013 slightly mucky concrete, strong-grained timber floors \u2013 contribute to the feeling of innate liveliness. So do those subsidiary rooms buried in the concrete towers.</p> <p>What holds it all together is the consistent logic of its construction, which is a concrete box wrapped in a brick outer wall, and the scale and effect of the hall. This is a stonking space, whose almost ludicrous monumentality manages to unbend into a rich array of niches and territories that serve the project\u2019s primary purpose of creating a livable family home. The hall is all the better for not following the standard modern response \u2013 the panoramic glass wall \u2013 to a beautiful setting. Nature, seen from inside, unfolds, rather than being revealed all at once.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"75b65094edfba90b88e55c17d25e01fad3ac4aec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/75b65094edfba90b88e55c17d25e01fad3ac4aec/0_0_5906_4429/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nithurst Farm bedroom\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Room with a view\u2026</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nithurst</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The living room, though handsome, is less potent than the hall. If this is the ultimate goal of the <em>Stalker</em>-inspired narrative, it turns out that it was better to travel than to arrive. And, in the end, the Tarkovsky theme has to fade away: it doesn\u2019t continue upstairs, for one thing, and there is no way that architecture (especially of the domestic kind) can replicate the moral and emotional peril of the movie. You don\u2019t really want to live with an unending fable of tragic impossibility.</p> <p>It is not in fact necessary to know the <em>Stalker</em> story to enjoy this house. What the movie does contribute is in part a creative formwork or armature off which all the architectural devices can be constructed. It is also a useful antidote to the bland optimism, what Richards calls \u201cfixed-grin architecture\u201d, to which his profession is prone. It helps him to bring shadows and mystery \u2013 rather than outright misery \u2013 into his domestic universe.</p> <p>At 397 square metres for a family of five, on a rare and blessed plot in rural England, Nithurst Farm is not, as the saying goes, going to solve the housing crisis. But, on its own terms, it succeeds. It seeks to enrich and deepen, both physically and perceptually, the experience of living in a house, and this it does brilliantly. The late Russian director, did he but know it, has certainly helped.</p>",

What holds it all together is the consistent logic of its construction, which is a concrete box wrapped in a brick outer wall, and the scale and effect of the hall. This is a stonking space, whose almost ludicrous monumentality manages to unbend into a rich array of niches and territories that serve the project\u2019s primary purpose of creating a livable family home. The hall is all the better for not following the standard modern response \u2013 the panoramic glass wall \u2013 to a beautiful setting. Nature, seen from inside, unfolds, rather than being revealed all at once. The living room, though handsome, is less potent than the hall. If this is the ultimate goal of the Stalker-inspired narrative, it turns out that it was better to travel than to arrive. And, in the end, the Tarkovsky theme has to fade away: it doesn\u2019t continue upstairs, for one thing, and there is no way that architecture (especially of the domestic kind) can replicate the moral and emotional peril of the movie. You don\u2019t really want to live with an unending fable of tragic impossibility. It is not in fact necessary to know the Stalker story to enjoy this house. What the movie does contribute is in part a creative formwork or armature off which all the architectural devices can be constructed. It is also a useful antidote to the bland optimism, what Richards calls \u201cfixed-grin architecture\u201d, to which his profession is prone. It helps him to bring shadows and mystery \u2013 rather than outright misery \u2013 into his domestic universe. At 397 square metres for a family of five, on a rare and blessed plot in rural England, Nithurst Farm is not, as the saying goes, going to solve the housing crisis. But, on its own terms, it succeeds. It seeks to enrich and deepen, both physically and perceptually, the experience of living in a house, and this it does brilliantly. The late Russian director, did he but know it, has certainly helped.",

He was unable to kick at goal thereafter but ended up as England\u2019s joint-top tackler.</p> \n<p>\u201cOwen and the leaders on the field were absolutely exceptional,\u201d said Jones. \u201cThey kept the team discipline, kept to our gameplan, kept attacking where we thought New Zealand were weak and didn\u2019t divert from that. They were able to get a bit of physical ascendancy [in the forwards]. It\u2019s always a battle.\u201d</p> \n<p>Tuilagi was the chief protagonist the last time England beat New Zealand back in 2012 and he was among the standout performers again. In the past seven years he has been blighted by injuries and after his try proved decisive in seeing off the All Blacks he said: \u201cIt\u2019s beyond my dreams. It\u2019s an unbelievable feeling.

      "bodyText": "Eddie Jones has said England beat the \u201cgod of rugby\u201d with their historic World Cup semi-final win over New Zealand but believes they will have to get even better to lift the trophy next Saturday. England moved to No 1 in the world rankings for the first time since 2004 after reaching their first World Cup final in 12 years but Jones insisted his side must complete the job against either Wales or South Africa to justify that billing. Manu Tuilagi\u2019s second-minute try and four George Ford penalties sealed England\u2019s first World Cup win over the All Blacks and took them to within 80 minutes of emulating Clive Woodward\u2019s class of 2003 and achieve their own sporting immortality. It was a sixth career win for Jones against New Zealand and one of the most impressive performances in World Cup history. \u201cNew Zealand are the god of rugby, so we had to take it to them,\u201d he said. \u201cWe wanted to take it to them and show we could take the game to them, try to put them on the back foot as much as we could. \u201cThey are a great team. They have won two World Cups in a row. They have got a great coach, a great captain, so we had to battle hard. \u201cYou always go in with an idea of how you want the game to be, but it never goes exactly like that. You have got to give so much credit to New Zealand, the way they kept fighting right until the end. We had to dig deep.\u201d Regardless of who wins Sunday\u2019s second semi-final between Wales and South Africa, England will go into the final as favourites, having started Saturday\u2019s semi-final as underdogs, given that New Zealand were the reigning two-times world champions. Asked where it ranked in terms of England\u2019s greatest performances, Jones said: \u201cWe have another week and we\u2019re looking forward to it. We\u2019re not historians, we don\u2019t know but we know that we can play better next week. We\u2019re going to have to play better next week, whoever we play against.\u201d Jones will pit his wits against the Springboks, for whom he worked as a consultant for their 2007 World Cup triumph, or renew rivalries with Warren Gatland, but said he had no preference. \u201cWe don\u2019t control that. But I\u2019ll definitely come and watch the game,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to Wales and South Africa playing a 3-3 draw, so they have to play extra time, it\u2019s still 3-3 and they have to play more extra time.\u201d Making the victory all the more impressive was the fact that their captain, Owen Farrell, picked up a leg injury during the first half. He was unable to kick at goal thereafter but ended up as England\u2019s joint-top tackler. \u201cOwen and the leaders on the field were absolutely exceptional,\u201d said Jones. \u201cThey kept the team discipline, kept to our gameplan, kept attacking where we thought New Zealand were weak and didn\u2019t divert from that. They were able to get a bit of physical ascendancy [in the forwards]. It\u2019s always a battle.\u201d Tuilagi was the chief protagonist the last time England beat New Zealand back in 2012 and he was among the standout performers again. In the past seven years he has been blighted by injuries and after his try proved decisive in seeing off the All Blacks he said: \u201cIt\u2019s beyond my dreams. It\u2019s an unbelievable feeling. It was amazing to get through to the semis. Standing here now and we\u2019re in the final.\u201d The New Zealand head coach, Steve Hansen, who steps down after the World Cup after eight years at the helm, was magnanimous in defeat and conceded that England fully deserved their place in the final. He also acknowledged that with the benefit of hindsight he would not have selected Scott Barrett, a lock by trade, in the back row, having taken him off at half-time. He reacted angrily, however, when his captain, Kieran Read, was asked whether New Zealand had been hungry enough to achieve victory. He said: \u201cThey\u2019re desperate to win the game, just because I\u2019ve asked them at half-time to get hungrier doesn\u2019t mean they didn\u2019t turn up to be hungry. \u201cThere\u2019s a big difference and if you want to spend some time outside, I\u2019ll give you a rugby education on that one.

      "body": "<p>To be or not to be an active royal, that is the question raised last week on behalf of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/prince-harry\" title=\"\">Prince Harry</a>, Duke of Sussex. It was aired by a concerned media after Harry used the media \u2013 his friend Tom Bradby\u2019s ITV documentary <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/22/harry-and-meghan-documentary-an-utter-disaster-for-royals\" title=\"\">Harry &amp; Meghan: An African Journey</a></em> \u2013 to discuss his bitter feelings about the media.</p> <p>That circular progression forms the perimeter of the hole in which the 35-year-old prince finds himself trapped. He feels surrounded by the same intrusive lenses he blames for his mother\u2019s death and, like Diana, Princess of Wales, he has tried to break free from them with an emotional appearance on primetime television.</p> <p>Are his complaints legitimate or a case study in the kind of spoilt privilege that is normally filed under the phrase \u201cfirst-world problems\u201d? Certainly the dubious optics of discussing his own struggles against the distressing backdrop of African deprivation did not go unnoticed by his critics. Nevertheless, what seems beyond doubt is that Harry is a genuinely troubled soul, a 21st-century tortured prince.</p> <p>For many years he was known as the fun-loving brother, a walking-talking-drinking threat to stately protocol. If you were looking for one of the Queen\u2019s grandchildren to be photographed playing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/aug/25/prince-harry-las-vegas-party\" title=\"\">naked billiards with a woman in Las Vegas</a> or wearing a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/jan/13/royalsandthemedia.pressandpublishing\" title=\"\">swastika armband</a> at a fancy-dress party, then Harry was your man.</p> <p>He was Prince Hal, the riotous royal without a role, a wayward but essentially likable young bloke who seemed to react to his weighty birthright with an irrepressible instinct for rebellion. But more recently, his anguished ruminations have suggested another Shakespearean hero \u2013 Hamlet, the tormented prince who wants to avenge the death of a parent.</p> <p>To hear him speak in Bradby\u2019s film, and indeed to watch his body language, was to see a man who, at least by his own lights, was taking up arms against a sea of troubles.</p> <p>\u201cPart of this job,\u201d he told Bradby, \u201cand part of any job, like everybody, is putting on a brave face and turning a cheek to a lot of the stuff, but again, for me and again for my wife, of course there is a lot of stuff that hurts, especially when the majority of it is untrue. But all we need to do is focus on being real, and focus on being the people that we are, and studying up for what we believe in.\u201d</p> <p>It may not have been a soaring soliloquy with an innate understanding of poetic metre, and you sense Harry has spent more time reading self-help books than the Bard, but it was clearly heartfelt and it expressed perhaps the only good advice given by Polonius, the chief counsellor in Hamlet: to thine own self be true.</p> <p>But who is Harry? One of the things that the man who is sixth in line to the throne has always found difficult to accept is that millions of strangers, people he\u2019s never met, feel as if they know who he is and are therefore in a position to pass judgment on him.</p> <p>When he was 21 and a cadet at Sandhurst, he gave an interview in which he said: \u201cI\u2019m never going to \u2026 convince the general public of who I am or what I want them to think I am, because my image is always being portrayed as something else. I don\u2019t want to change. I am who I am. I\u2019m not going to change because I\u2019m being criticised in the press.\u201d</p> <p>Though he is older and wiser, the conviction that he is routinely and deliberately misrepresented remains unchanged. This sense of being made a caricature is an issue, he has said, that also aggrieved his father \u2013 in Prince Charles\u2019s case as a hapless and ineffectual busybody. It\u2019s not hard to imagine that Charles\u2019s obvious resentment of the media has helped inform his youngest son\u2019s suspicions.</p> <p>The problem is that the media are vital to the monarchy\u2019s survival, like a parasite on which the host comes to depend. If their visits, births and weddings ceased to be the subject of media attention, they would sink into irrelevance. Royalty \u2013 the idea of a superior bloodline \u2013 is a dying anachronism, but celebrity is alive and flourishing.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>All we need to do is focus on being real, and focus on being the people that we are</p> <footer> <cite>Prince Harry</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The Queen will very likely prove to be the last monarch to retain a regal distance from the outside world.

But it\u2019s hard to think what other game is available to a royal who wants to maintain a high profile.</p> <p>Harry\u2019s wife, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, has experience of the Hollywood kind of celebrity, a system controlled by ferocious publicists producing stage-managed interviews. According to a CNN report, based on \u201ca source close to the Sussexes\u201d, she seems to have believed she could play a role in reforming an antiquated institution to harness the \u201cvalue\u201d of a couple that has \u201csingle-handedly modernised the monarchy\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0e7bc751ec0d133e2ed0aedbce3ba357cd1707e0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e7bc751ec0d133e2ed0aedbce3ba357cd1707e0/0_99_2062_2060/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Harry and Meghan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Harry and Meghan at the WellChild Awards in London this month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That kind of controlled approach to image-maintenance may work with <em>Vanity Fair</em> but it\u2019s not going to play in a tabloid world in which off-the-record briefings and forthright opinions are the lifeblood of royal coverage.

As a mixed-race couple, they represent a refreshing break with the prejudices of the past.</p> <p>Moreover Harry, like his mother, has a winning personal touch with ordinary people. An executive at the Children\u2019s Society says that he recently did some work with the charity in which he charmed everyone he dealt with.</p> <p>Dylan Jones, the editor of <em>GQ</em>, says he\u2019s met the prince several times and always found him \u201capproachable, funny, engaging and whip-smart\u201d. He recalls a photo session in which David Bailey was on confrontational form, but Harry managed to win the banter contest.</p> <p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t suffer fools gladly,\u201d says Jones, \u201cbut then why should he? He\u2019s always come across as a leader.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps his greatest strength, at this particular juncture in history, is his vulnerability. By coming forward a couple of years ago to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/apr/17/prince-harry-grief-revelations-praise-mental-health-experts\" title=\"\">discuss his mental health problems</a>, he chimed with a younger generation eager to normalise the issue of mental illness. He spoke of how he shut down his emotions for 20 years after his mother died, and how he consulted a therapist.</p> <p>As someone who not only lost his mother at a tender age but also, according to his own testament, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/jan/21/prince-harry-afghanistan\" title=\"\">killed enemy fighters in Afghanistan</a>, he has a lot of haunting experiences to resolve. It doesn\u2019t help, of course, to be doing it under attack from a hostile media. Harry strongly implied to Bradby that his dark days had returned.</p> <p>If that is the case, he has two options. The first is to develop a zen-like indifference to the speculation and criticism that his life as a leading royal generates. To suffer, in other words, the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune. The other is to help revive \u201cthe Firm\u201d by cutting back on its numbers. He could take the large fortune he has, withdraw from public life, and devote himself to the good causes of his choice.</p> <p>That way he and his wife can live rather than, as she puts it, \u201cexist\u201d. To be or to thrive: that is the royal question the celebrity prince must face.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 29 October 2019 to clarify that the legal action is against News Group Newspapers (NGN), publisher of the <em>Sun</em>.</p>",

An executive at the Children\u2019s Society says that he recently did some work with the charity in which he charmed everyone he dealt with. Dylan Jones, the editor of GQ, says he\u2019s met the prince several times and always found him \u201capproachable, funny, engaging and whip-smart\u201d. He recalls a photo session in which David Bailey was on confrontational form, but Harry managed to win the banter contest. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t suffer fools gladly,\u201d says Jones, \u201cbut then why should he? He\u2019s always come across as a leader.\u201d Perhaps his greatest strength, at this particular juncture in history, is his vulnerability. By coming forward a couple of years ago to discuss his mental health problems, he chimed with a younger generation eager to normalise the issue of mental illness. He spoke of how he shut down his emotions for 20 years after his mother died, and how he consulted a therapist. As someone who not only lost his mother at a tender age but also, according to his own testament, killed enemy fighters in Afghanistan, he has a lot of haunting experiences to resolve. It doesn\u2019t help, of course, to be doing it under attack from a hostile media. Harry strongly implied to Bradby that his dark days had returned. If that is the case, he has two options. The first is to develop a zen-like indifference to the speculation and criticism that his life as a leading royal generates. To suffer, in other words, the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune. The other is to help revive \u201cthe Firm\u201d by cutting back on its numbers. He could take the large fortune he has, withdraw from public life, and devote himself to the good causes of his choice. That way he and his wife can live rather than, as she puts it, \u201cexist\u201d. To be or to thrive: that is the royal question the celebrity prince must face. \u2022 This article was amended on 29 October 2019 to clarify that the legal action is against News Group Newspapers (NGN), publisher of the Sun.",

The business minister Kwasi Kwarteng admitted on Saturday that it would be very difficult for Britain to leave the European Union next week, but he dismissed reports employees\u2019 rights would be slashed after Brexit as \u201cway exaggerated\u201d.

The US-born entrepreneur began her business at a glitter-strewn kitchen table in 1985. The luxury department store Bergdorf Goodman, in New York, was her first client and she has been quietly busy ever since. Today, <a href=\"https://merimeri.co.uk\" title=\"\">Meri Meri</a> stationery, homewares, toys and reusable party trimmings, in her trademark pastels and neons, line the shelves of stores across the world.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve always designed for parents like me, who want to add a bit of magic to their children\u2019s lives,\u201d says Stuart-Smith, a mother of two. Many of those designs began here in the Cheltenham home she shares with her husband and grown-up son (her daughter now works in Birmingham). The four-bedroom property is set in a stucco-fronted 1840 rectory, which was sliced into three apartments in the 1950s. \u201cThe proportions are grand, but it\u2019s not an overly elaborate house,\u201d says Stuart-Smith, who has kept the decor accordingly \u201cmodest\u201d. Walls are washed in a concert of bluey-whites; the original, wonky floorboards painted a shiny cocoa brown. Like her designs, the charm of this house lies in the details: a row of Surrealist plates, the swan-shaped cushion afloat on a petite sofa. \u201cI\u2019m drawn to things that are clean-lined, with a bit of fun thrown in,\u201d she enthuses. \u201cI love wallpaper and colour, but I couldn\u2019t live with that intensity.

The kitchen units are Ikea, the frugality offset by a long stretch of glossy stone worktop. Instead of pendant lights, a hand-blown glass mobile (from <a href=\"https://www.anthropologie.com/en-gb/\" title=\"\">Anthropologie</a>) dangles above. Thin, floating shelves are lined with Stuart-Smith\u2019s favourite Fornasetti plates and ceramics by local potter <a href=\"http://www.davidgarland.co.uk/\" title=\"\">David Garland</a>. \u201cNothing is precious \u2013 just to me.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I love wallpaper and colour, but I couldn\u2019t live with that intensity.

The shutters and fireplace are original, but the hearth is made from aubergine slate, originally used as the surface of a billiards table. The ceiling soars to almost 3m high but, like everything in this household, nothing is too formal or overdone. Gilded mirrors are propped nonchalantly against walls, mismatching rugs scattered across floors.</p> <p>The dining table, the setting for countless birthday parties, is Habitat; the Philippe Starck chairs, in a loud Missoni print, add requisite fun to the all-white setting. Instead of a \u201czillion dollar\u201d chandelier, a friend made a pendant light in the hallway from cardboard rolls wrapped in brown paper, for retro effect.</p> <p>Stuart-Smith, who moved to the UK in 1996, has always travelled light.

We did the renovation in stages, moving from room to room like nomads.\u201d A few years ago they uprooted the kitchen, from the basement, to the ground floor. \u201cI\u2019d read an article about Jasper Conran\u2019s apartment where he\u2019d put his kitchen in a classical room with a cornice and fireplace. I thought, \u2018That\u2019s what I want.\u2019\u201d An interior-designer friend, Pip Isherwood, helped out. The kitchen units are Ikea, the frugality offset by a long stretch of glossy stone worktop. Instead of pendant lights, a hand-blown glass mobile (from Anthropologie) dangles above. Thin, floating shelves are lined with Stuart-Smith\u2019s favourite Fornasetti plates and ceramics by local potter David Garland. \u201cNothing is precious \u2013 just to me.\u201d She added the new double doors that lead to the sitting room. The shutters and fireplace are original, but the hearth is made from aubergine slate, originally used as the surface of a billiards table. The ceiling soars to almost 3m high but, like everything in this household, nothing is too formal or overdone. Gilded mirrors are propped nonchalantly against walls, mismatching rugs scattered across floors. The dining table, the setting for countless birthday parties, is Habitat; the Philippe Starck chairs, in a loud Missoni print, add requisite fun to the all-white setting. Instead of a \u201czillion dollar\u201d chandelier, a friend made a pendant light in the hallway from cardboard rolls wrapped in brown paper, for retro effect. Stuart-Smith, who moved to the UK in 1996, has always travelled light. The few possessions that this low-key creative does have are treasured not for their value but for their meaning. \u201cAlmost everything here tells a story,\u201d she says. The steamer-trunk coffee table came from her first apartment in San Francisco. \u201cI always think about replacing it with something fabulous, but I can\u2019t seem to do it.\u201d Upstairs, the Victorian sofa belonged to her husband\u2019s family and doubled as a bed on their voyages to and from India. Some of her favourite pieces are the portraits of Native Americans by Leonard Baskin, a US-born academic and artist, who moved his family to Devon to be close to his friend, the poet Ted Hughes. \u201cI\u2019ve been collecting his work for 20 years,\u201d says Stuart-Smith. \u201cIt keeps me grounded.\u201d Art, interiors and fashion have always influenced her designs. It is what sets Meri Meri pieces apart and explains why Victoria Beckham has one of Stuart-Smith\u2019s sparkly reindeer backpacks and Sarah Jessica Parker was spotted assembling a Meri Meri flamingo pi\u00f1ata on Instagram. \u201cCouture\u201d fancy dress \u2013 swan capes, tulle skirts \u2013 is a recent addition to the range. \u201cLast year I went to the Heavenly Bodies show at the Met and found the perfect idea for our angel wings,\u201d she says. \u201cThe Mary Quant exhibition, at the V&amp;A flooded me with ideas for \u201970s-inspired patterns. At Meri Meri we\u2019re always ready to play.\u201d merimeri.com Interior styling by Sania Pell",

People live longer, healthier lives. Air quality is better, and individuals are on average twice as wealthy.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is the golden age for the region,\u201d says Marcin Piatkowski, a Polish economist who recently authored a book called Europe\u2019s Growth Champion, about the meteoric rise of Poland\u2019s economy over the past three decades. \u201cThe whole region has been successful, as reflected in the fact that on average, no Bulgarian, or Romanian or Pole has ever lived better than they do now, both in absolute terms and in relative terms compared to the west.\u201d</p> \n<p>Such optimism often feels misplaced, given that many people in the region still feel left behind. But the statistics show that since 1990, the Polish and Slovak economies have grown more than sevenfold, and those of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania and the Czech Republic more than fivefold.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/oct/2019-10-24T09:35:49/embed.html\" data-alt=\"chart\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/oct/2019-10-24T09:35:49/embed.html\">chart</a> \n</figure> \n<p>At the same time, the nations remain some of the most equal in the world, as measured by the Gini coefficient (one of the leading measures of wealth distribution).</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/oct/2019-10-24T09:48:06/embed.html\" data-alt=\"chart\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/oct/2019-10-24T09:48:06/embed.html\">chart</a> \n</figure> \n<p>There have been benefits when it comes to quality of life, too.

Young and enthusiastic as the transition came, he eagerly sought out any economic opportunities going. His first business involved repeated trips to Hamburg, where he would sleep in the car and return with a carload of spare automobile parts, which he could sell on for a profit. Later, he invested money in an internet startup, and then into construction. He now runs one of the city\u2019s biggest companies.</p> \n<p>The \u201cshock therapy\u201d reforms that speedily pushed Poland and other countries in the region into capitalism have come in for criticism, but Leszek Balcerowicz, the architect of Poland\u2019s reforms, still believes they were the best option for the country in the circumstances. \u201cIf you move fast from a bad system to a better one, you release new forces for growth,\u201d he says in an interview at the Warsaw School of Economics, where he is now a professor.</p> \n<p>While communism left the region an economic basket case, it did also provide some of the seeds for growth: well-educated societies with low levels of inequality. And crucially, unlike in Russia and Ukraine, central European countries largely avoided a situation where a few people walked off with the majority of the prized former state assets.</p> \n<p>Particularly in Poland, the transition led to a class of entrepreneurs like Grabski, rather than a small group of oligarchs. \u201cWe had the Solidarity movement in the factories and they were like a watchdog. So directors couldn\u2019t go into shabby deals like in Russia,\u201d says Balcerowicz.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"de3063353c61f2616cf03c44f9e16f3071b9166a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/de3063353c61f2616cf03c44f9e16f3071b9166a/0_28_5197_3118/1000.jpg\" alt=\"city\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Turning the tables.

With much of eastern Europe becoming part of the single market, it could be integrated into western European supply chains. For smaller businesses, it also meant operating in an improved institutional setting and convergence with EU standards. \u201cJoining the EU was the key moment, not because of subsidies, but because of frameworks: anti-monopoly rules, environmental protection and so on,\u201d says Grabski.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dcfa5d40dca8d2451ba3aa59e337e672721b8b58\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dcfa5d40dca8d2451ba3aa59e337e672721b8b58/0_0_3000_2291/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Locals mark Poland\u2019s accession to the EU in April 2004.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"764\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Locals mark Poland\u2019s accession to the EU in April 2004.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carsten Koall/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In some countries in the region, these institutional frameworks are still under attack from governments, but the situation compared with neighbouring Ukraine, for example, where the courts, police and tax authorities are hopelessly dependent on political and big business interests, is incomparable.</p> \n<p>Life under capitalism was not rosy for everyone. At the vast Gda\u0144sk shipyard, where Solidarity was born, the majority of orders came from the communist bloc and dried up after the transition.</p> \n<p>The shipyard was kept afloat with government subsidies, but these were deemed unfair according to EU competition laws. The shipyard was divided into several private enterprises, and little actual shipbuilding is still taking place. Many other communist-era factories across the region have gone the same way, unable to adapt to market conditions.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"33d73cc71635dc02fcdd2c00c2587f9b2eaab15b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/33d73cc71635dc02fcdd2c00c2587f9b2eaab15b/0_0_2286_3000/762.jpg\" alt=\"The shipyard in Gdansk struggled to adjust to the collapse of the communist bloc and to survive under EU competition laws and market conditions.\" width=\"762\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The shipyard in Gda\u0144sk struggled to adjust to the collapse of the communist bloc and to survive under EU competition laws and market conditions.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Czarek Soko\u0142owski/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>But in place of the hulking shipyard, a number of smaller companies building yachts have sprung up in Gda\u0144sk and elsewhere on Poland\u2019s Baltic coast, and many of them have become successful.</p> \n<p>However, if there is one factory that symbolises both central Europe\u2019s growth over the last three decades and the potential pitfalls going forward, it is not the Gda\u0144sk shipyard but the Audi plant at Gy\u0151r, in north-west Hungary.</p> \n<p>Audi first invested in the site in the early 1990s when it was a moribund heavy machinery factory for mainly communist bloc clients. </p> \n<p>Things took off when Hungary joined the EU in 2004 and could be integrated fully into the manufacturer\u2019s supply chain. Today, Audi Hungaria is a modern-day capitalist version of a Soviet <em>monogorod</em>, or one-factory town. The vast complex on the outskirts of Gy\u0151r is a set of nondescript white hangars linked by an internal road system, and the plant has its own restaurants, medical clinic, fire station and postal service.</p> \n<p>Every single Audi TT in the world is assembled here, while engines for many other models are also produced and shipped to Germany and elsewhere for assembly. In one vast hall, giant yellow Japanese robots whoosh and whir their way through the process of assembling the car bodies, cutting, welding, applying adhesives and piecing the cars together with minimal human input. Workers scurry between the halls, many with colour-coded polo-shirt collars denoting their status on the assembly line.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2f70a5212e2386c0b5d75e4b0ddcb1e2024649a0\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f70a5212e2386c0b5d75e4b0ddcb1e2024649a0/0_109_1890_1134/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A worker checks the engine compartment of an Audi TT Coupe at the Audi factory in Gyoer, Hungary.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A worker checks the engine compartment of an Audi TT Coupe at the Audi factory in Gy\u0151r, Hungary.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karoly Matusz/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The plant has over 13,000 employees, and when subcontractors and affiliated businesses are taken into account, it is estimated that between 25,000 and 30,000 people in Gy\u0151r work in the automobile industry, which could amount to as much as half of the working-age population.</p> \n<p>While Poland is more diversified, by virtue of being the region\u2019s biggest economy, for smaller countries in the region, the dependence on the German car market is huge, and some worry about the effects of a slump in the market on places like Gy\u0151r. \u201cIf Volkswagen can\u2019t sell to China, Slovakia gets hammered the next day,\u201d says Piatkowski.</p> \n<p>Going forward, the key will be moving away from an economic model of western European countries outsourcing production to the east, and towards one that sees ideas and innovation developed inside the region. Only in this way, analysts say, will the countries of the region be able to fully close the gap in wealth and living standards with the other half of Europe. So far, however, there is little sign of the spending on research and development, or institutional reforms, that would be required for such a long-term shift.</p> \n<p>\u201cSmart people across the region understand that the growth model is over, but whether real change is politically feasible is another question,\u201d says Milan Ni\u010d, head of the central and eastern Europe programme at the German Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cWhat I see is that businesses are looking for loopholes rather than changing the overall policies.\u201d</p> \n<p>This kind of supply-chain relationship amplifies regional disgruntlement at being regarded a \u201csecond-tier\u201d backwater by \u201cold Europe\u201d. Thirty years since the Velvet Revolution, some of those who helped bring down communism in 1989 are now supporters of populist governments who accrue political capital by attacking the EU.</p> \n<p>L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Nagy, one of the organisers of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/18/how-a-pan-european-picnic-brought-down-the-iron-curtain-hungarians-austrians\">pan-European picnic in 1989,</a> which presaged the fall of the Berlin Wall by allowing hundreds of East Germans to cross the Iron Curtain from Hungary to Austria and onwards to West Germany, complains that western Europe treats the new states like \u201cthe doormat of Europe\u201d, with a condescending and patronising attitude.</p> \n<p>Additionally, while the statistics may show that on average even the poorest parts of society are better off than they were 30 years ago, this is little comfort to those in former industrial areas or rural regions where there is an overwhelming sense of decay; indeed, that decay can feel ever more pressing when compared to the progress experienced in shinier areas.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a5947407-4f95-41fe-849d-e7d9248ebcb7\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Ever wondered why you feel so gloomy about the world - even at a time when humanity has never been this healthy and prosperous?

Jolanta Banach, a former Polish finance minister from a leftist party, puts much of the popularity of the country\u2019s current populist government in smaller towns and villages down to the unequal access to public services and infrastructure: while big cities in Poland are now linked by modern fast trains, public transport in rural areas is often poor, an issue across the wider region too.</p> \n<p>Public health and education services are generally in better shape than 30 years ago, but also remain underfunded. \u201cWhen you look at the Gini factor, it\u2019s not so bad, but that hides a lot of things. What you don\u2019t see in the statistics is the uneven access to public services and infrastructure,\u201d says Banach.</p> \n<p>The introduction of freedom of movement with EU accession has also led to millions of central and eastern Europeans heading west over the past 15 years. On the one hand, this has provided opportunities and experiences that were unimaginable to the previous generation who were stuck behind the Iron Curtain, but it has also combined with declining birth rates and a fear of immigration to contribute to shrinking societies.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"328d64852bd69def49deff79b190f92e2dfbb43b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/328d64852bd69def49deff79b190f92e2dfbb43b/59_180_3351_2011/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Riga, capital of Latvia, which has lost more than a quarter of its population in the last 30 years.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Riga, capital of Latvia, which has lost more than a quarter of its population in the last 30 years.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Chung/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In the three decades since independence, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/01/europe-south-and-east-worry-more-about-emigration-than-immigration-poll\">the populations of all the region\u2019s </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/01/europe-south-and-east-worry-more-about-emigration-than-immigration-poll\">countries have shrunk</a>. Latvia has lost more than a quarter of its population, Bulgaria and Romania around a fifth. With higher salaries a short and easy flight away, the process was inevitable. In parts of the region, this has led to chronic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/21/romanian-hospitals-in-crisis-as-emigration-take-its-toll\">shortages of doctors</a> and other skilled workers.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/03/popuation-change-zip/giv-3902leY08K5RYnIs/\" data-alt=\"chart\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/03/popuation-change-zip/giv-3902leY08K5RYnIs/\">chart</a> \n</figure> \n<p>In the long run, if the countries of central and eastern Europe can continue to catch up with the west, many of the emigres will be drawn back. With Brexit stalking the UK, there <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/feb/24/poles-return-east-higher-wages-job-uk-lose-brexit\">are already anecdotal signs of an incipient return</a>. There are flights from London and other western European hubs to dozens of cities in the region, often cheaply.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t lost these people,\u201d says Piatkowski. \u201cThe form of emigration has changed. In the 19th century a redneck from the Polish mountains would move to America and you\u2019d never hear of him for 100 years. Now you can get a \u20ac20 Ryanair flight back to Krak\u00f3w.\u201d</p> \n<p>As the economic gap between the east and the west of the continent continues to narrow, it is possible that many of these people will eventually return to their home countries, bringing with them money, skills and networks developed during their time abroad. </p> \n<p>For all the problems, Piatkowski says it\u2019s worth acknowledging just how fast things have improved.

      "bodyText": "Maciej Grabski looks out over a panoramic view of the Baltic Sea, from the 32nd floor of the Olivia Star tower in Gda\u0144sk, Poland. \u201cMy children never saw the dark, devastated atmosphere that I remember from the 1980s,\u201d he says. \u201cMany people take things for granted now.\u201d The tower, built by Grabski\u2019s construction company, is the centrepiece of a new business development on the outskirts of Gda\u0144sk, and filled with the offices of multinational companies. It is next door to the squat, concrete Olivia sports hall, where the Solidarity trade union movement held its first congress in 1981, heralding the beginning of the end for communism in the region. The economic demands of Solidarity, which had sprung up at the huge Gda\u0144sk shipyard and was led by Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa, rippled through Poland and then the rest of central and eastern Europe during the 1980s. By the end of the decade, borders were open, regimes collapsed and the Berlin Wall, concrete symbol of 45 years of European division, was being pulled down. What happened next was extraordinary, painful and unpredictable, as an entire region lurched into uncharted territory. Progress was fitful, messy and often unevenly distributed, sowing the seeds in some countries for the recent rise of populism. But 30 years on from the heady days of autumn 1989, a range of metrics demonstrate that the transition from communism to capitalism has been a remarkable success. Central and eastern Europe over the past 30 years has witnessed one of the most dramatic economic spurts of growth that any region of the world has ever experienced. People live longer, healthier lives. Air quality is better, and individuals are on average twice as wealthy. \u201cThis is the golden age for the region,\u201d says Marcin Piatkowski, a Polish economist who recently authored a book called Europe\u2019s Growth Champion, about the meteoric rise of Poland\u2019s economy over the past three decades. \u201cThe whole region has been successful, as reflected in the fact that on average, no Bulgarian, or Romanian or Pole has ever lived better than they do now, both in absolute terms and in relative terms compared to the west.\u201d Such optimism often feels misplaced, given that many people in the region still feel left behind. But the statistics show that since 1990, the Polish and Slovak economies have grown more than sevenfold, and those of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania and the Czech Republic more than fivefold. At the same time, the nations remain some of the most equal in the world, as measured by the Gini coefficient (one of the leading measures of wealth distribution). There have been benefits when it comes to quality of life, too. In 1990, the average Hungarian, Latvian or Romanian did not live to see their 70th birthday, and life expectancy in other east European countries was not much better. Since then, longevity has surged as much as 10% in some parts of the region, and east Europeans are now more likely to be nearer 80 than 70 when they die. Grabski, born in Gda\u0144sk in 1968, has a story similar to many of the generation of Polish entrepreneurs in the years after the collapse of communism. Young and enthusiastic as the transition came, he eagerly sought out any economic opportunities going. His first business involved repeated trips to Hamburg, where he would sleep in the car and return with a carload of spare automobile parts, which he could sell on for a profit. Later, he invested money in an internet startup, and then into construction. He now runs one of the city\u2019s biggest companies. The \u201cshock therapy\u201d reforms that speedily pushed Poland and other countries in the region into capitalism have come in for criticism, but Leszek Balcerowicz, the architect of Poland\u2019s reforms, still believes they were the best option for the country in the circumstances. \u201cIf you move fast from a bad system to a better one, you release new forces for growth,\u201d he says in an interview at the Warsaw School of Economics, where he is now a professor. While communism left the region an economic basket case, it did also provide some of the seeds for growth: well-educated societies with low levels of inequality. And crucially, unlike in Russia and Ukraine, central European countries largely avoided a situation where a few people walked off with the majority of the prized former state assets. Particularly in Poland, the transition led to a class of entrepreneurs like Grabski, rather than a small group of oligarchs. \u201cWe had the Solidarity movement in the factories and they were like a watchdog. So directors couldn\u2019t go into shabby deals like in Russia,\u201d says Balcerowicz. Life under capitalism Fifteen years after the transition, Poland and seven other former communist east European countries joined the EU. With much of eastern Europe becoming part of the single market, it could be integrated into western European supply chains. For smaller businesses, it also meant operating in an improved institutional setting and convergence with EU standards. \u201cJoining the EU was the key moment, not because of subsidies, but because of frameworks: anti-monopoly rules, environmental protection and so on,\u201d says Grabski. In some countries in the region, these institutional frameworks are still under attack from governments, but the situation compared with neighbouring Ukraine, for example, where the courts, police and tax authorities are hopelessly dependent on political and big business interests, is incomparable. Life under capitalism was not rosy for everyone. At the vast Gda\u0144sk shipyard, where Solidarity was born, the majority of orders came from the communist bloc and dried up after the transition. The shipyard was kept afloat with government subsidies, but these were deemed unfair according to EU competition laws. The shipyard was divided into several private enterprises, and little actual shipbuilding is still taking place. Many other communist-era factories across the region have gone the same way, unable to adapt to market conditions. But in place of the hulking shipyard, a number of smaller companies building yachts have sprung up in Gda\u0144sk and elsewhere on Poland\u2019s Baltic coast, and many of them have become successful. However, if there is one factory that symbolises both central Europe\u2019s growth over the last three decades and the potential pitfalls going forward, it is not the Gda\u0144sk shipyard but the Audi plant at Gy\u0151r, in north-west Hungary. Audi first invested in the site in the early 1990s when it was a moribund heavy machinery factory for mainly communist bloc clients. Things took off when Hungary joined the EU in 2004 and could be integrated fully into the manufacturer\u2019s supply chain. Today, Audi Hungaria is a modern-day capitalist version of a Soviet monogorod, or one-factory town. The vast complex on the outskirts of Gy\u0151r is a set of nondescript white hangars linked by an internal road system, and the plant has its own restaurants, medical clinic, fire station and postal service. Every single Audi TT in the world is assembled here, while engines for many other models are also produced and shipped to Germany and elsewhere for assembly. In one vast hall, giant yellow Japanese robots whoosh and whir their way through the process of assembling the car bodies, cutting, welding, applying adhesives and piecing the cars together with minimal human input. Workers scurry between the halls, many with colour-coded polo-shirt collars denoting their status on the assembly line. The plant has over 13,000 employees, and when subcontractors and affiliated businesses are taken into account, it is estimated that between 25,000 and 30,000 people in Gy\u0151r work in the automobile industry, which could amount to as much as half of the working-age population. While Poland is more diversified, by virtue of being the region\u2019s biggest economy, for smaller countries in the region, the dependence on the German car market is huge, and some worry about the effects of a slump in the market on places like Gy\u0151r. \u201cIf Volkswagen can\u2019t sell to China, Slovakia gets hammered the next day,\u201d says Piatkowski. Going forward, the key will be moving away from an economic model of western European countries outsourcing production to the east, and towards one that sees ideas and innovation developed inside the region. Only in this way, analysts say, will the countries of the region be able to fully close the gap in wealth and living standards with the other half of Europe. So far, however, there is little sign of the spending on research and development, or institutional reforms, that would be required for such a long-term shift. \u201cSmart people across the region understand that the growth model is over, but whether real change is politically feasible is another question,\u201d says Milan Ni\u010d, head of the central and eastern Europe programme at the German Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cWhat I see is that businesses are looking for loopholes rather than changing the overall policies.\u201d This kind of supply-chain relationship amplifies regional disgruntlement at being regarded a \u201csecond-tier\u201d backwater by \u201cold Europe\u201d. Thirty years since the Velvet Revolution, some of those who helped bring down communism in 1989 are now supporters of populist governments who accrue political capital by attacking the EU. L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Nagy, one of the organisers of the pan-European picnic in 1989, which presaged the fall of the Berlin Wall by allowing hundreds of East Germans to cross the Iron Curtain from Hungary to Austria and onwards to West Germany, complains that western Europe treats the new states like \u201cthe doormat of Europe\u201d, with a condescending and patronising attitude. Additionally, while the statistics may show that on average even the poorest parts of society are better off than they were 30 years ago, this is little comfort to those in former industrial areas or rural regions where there is an overwhelming sense of decay; indeed, that decay can feel ever more pressing when compared to the progress experienced in shinier areas. Not everyone is convinced that the impressive statistics tell the whole story. Jolanta Banach, a former Polish finance minister from a leftist party, puts much of the popularity of the country\u2019s current populist government in smaller towns and villages down to the unequal access to public services and infrastructure: while big cities in Poland are now linked by modern fast trains, public transport in rural areas is often poor, an issue across the wider region too. Public health and education services are generally in better shape than 30 years ago, but also remain underfunded. \u201cWhen you look at the Gini factor, it\u2019s not so bad, but that hides a lot of things. What you don\u2019t see in the statistics is the uneven access to public services and infrastructure,\u201d says Banach. The introduction of freedom of movement with EU accession has also led to millions of central and eastern Europeans heading west over the past 15 years. On the one hand, this has provided opportunities and experiences that were unimaginable to the previous generation who were stuck behind the Iron Curtain, but it has also combined with declining birth rates and a fear of immigration to contribute to shrinking societies. In the three decades since independence, the populations of all the region\u2019s countries have shrunk. Latvia has lost more than a quarter of its population, Bulgaria and Romania around a fifth. With higher salaries a short and easy flight away, the process was inevitable. In parts of the region, this has led to chronic shortages of doctors and other skilled workers. In the long run, if the countries of central and eastern Europe can continue to catch up with the west, many of the emigres will be drawn back. With Brexit stalking the UK, there are already anecdotal signs of an incipient return. There are flights from London and other western European hubs to dozens of cities in the region, often cheaply. \u201cWe haven\u2019t lost these people,\u201d says Piatkowski. \u201cThe form of emigration has changed. In the 19th century a redneck from the Polish mountains would move to America and you\u2019d never hear of him for 100 years. Now you can get a \u20ac20 Ryanair flight back to Krak\u00f3w.\u201d As the economic gap between the east and the west of the continent continues to narrow, it is possible that many of these people will eventually return to their home countries, bringing with them money, skills and networks developed during their time abroad. For all the problems, Piatkowski says it\u2019s worth acknowledging just how fast things have improved. Poland has moved from 25% of German income levels 30 years ago to 60% today. \u201cYou can\u2019t expect Poles to completely catch up with Germans within one generation. It\u2019s only natural for people to aspire to a good life as quickly as possible. But it\u2019s just unrealistic for this to happen. The whole region has been the dark periphery of Europe for the last 1,000 years,\u201d he says. Wa\u0142\u0119sa, Solidarity\u2019s leader and post-communist Poland\u2019s first president, who was in charge when the shock therapy reforms were made, has become a marginal figure on the Polish political scene, and his cantankerous criticisms of the current government are sometimes seen as counterproductive even by the opposition. But he is still respected for his role in bringing the country out of communism. Reflecting on today\u2019s economy, he thinks neoliberal economies require regulation to make sure they stay fair. \u201cWhen there was a communist bloc, the two systems were keeping each other in check to some extent,\u201d he says in an interview at his office in Gda\u0144sk. \u201cNow there is no control over the development of capitalism.

I was like: \u201cOh my days, there\u2019s someone out there that\u2019s willing to listen to a story how I would say it in my head.\u201d And because the characters were relatable, it made me look at my peers differently: I realised, we all have stories that deserve to be told.</p> <p><strong>Can you tell us about the play</strong><strong>?</strong><br>It\u2019s a storytelling triptych, of three teenagers relaying to us the times they grew up in. I don\u2019t understand why it hasn\u2019t been more done \u2013 the themes are so universal. We need to start archiving the way we speak in London, especially MLE [multicultural London English, a social dialect].

And I mixed in all sorts of music \u2013 as it\u2019s named after a garage song, I made sure the garage was flowing.</p> <p><strong>How important is music to you?</strong><br>It\u2019s another character in my work. The reason I chose [Shanks &amp; Bigfoot\u2019s 1999 track] <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qp6XhtoEv0\" title=\"\">Sweet Like Chocolate</a> is because it\u2019s my favourite song. But also the lyrics mean two things to me: number one, I am brilliant \u2013 to be black and British is a beautiful thing, even when it\u2019s been hard. But it also made me realise that your identity can very much be consumed and devoured, to the point where you are seen as confectionery.</p> <p><strong>You\u2019ve worked as an actor too.

Do we still see stereotyped or limited roles for young black men?</strong><br>I will never say to a black person \u201cnobody needs to hear that story\u201d, because it\u2019s hard out here as it is. But you need to actually listen to a varied selection of black creatives, and give black people the keys to the building, and then you\u2019ll see a varied selection of stories. But there\u2019s also the question about whether people actually do want to hear them or they\u2019re just running their mouth\u2026</p> <p><strong>Are some people in charge of theatres just running their mouths?</strong><br>Oh yes, absolutely. It\u2019s a tick-box exercise right now. It\u2019s a good way of getting some funding. I think we, as people, need to be better at sussing it out \u2013 and taking our money away from them.</p> <p><strong>Are we currently seeing a change in the people who get the keys?</strong><br>Artistic directors diversifying is a fantastic thing. But it\u2019s not enough. It\u2019s about the executive producers as well \u2013 the people handling money, all facets of the industry.</p> <p><strong>What shows have you always wanted to stage?</strong><br>I would love to do a play by <a href=\"https://newdramatists.org/marcus-gardley\" title=\"\">Marcus Gardley</a>. And I\u2019d like to do more shows by black British writers across the regions. If Brexit\u2019s taught us anything, it\u2019s that we need to be looking outside of London.</p>",

You\u2019ve said that Arinz\u00e9 Kene\u2019s Little Baby Jesus changed your life? It was one of the first plays I saw \u2013 I was 16 at the time \u2013 and the first that spoke in a language that was akin to what I heard in the playground, but mixed in with the poetry and imagination we\u2019d hear in English. I was like: \u201cOh my days, there\u2019s someone out there that\u2019s willing to listen to a story how I would say it in my head.\u201d And because the characters were relatable, it made me look at my peers differently: I realised, we all have stories that deserve to be told. Can you tell us about the play? It\u2019s a storytelling triptych, of three teenagers relaying to us the times they grew up in. I don\u2019t understand why it hasn\u2019t been more done \u2013 the themes are so universal. We need to start archiving the way we speak in London, especially MLE [multicultural London English, a social dialect]. It came at a time of resurgence of this poetic, narrative structure for young playwrights: after this came Chewing Gum Dreams by Michaela Coel [in 2014]. And Sabrina Mahfouz started popping up. It was a renaissance of this kind of style, which should be cherished, because it gives people you wouldn\u2019t expect a voice. This play should be on the GCSE syllabus! How closely have you been working with Arinz\u00e9 Kene? He\u2019s been very connected to the piece, but he\u2019s not put a hand on and said \u201cI do want this\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t want that\u201d. He\u2019s very open to me just trying out different things. How important are awards like the JMK award? Incredibly important. Because it gives me money! Let\u2019s be real \u2013 as much as it gives me kudos and standing, it also gives me actual money to put on an actual production to professional standard. You wrote the 2018 play Sweet Like Chocolate, Boy\u2026 It\u2019s about two black boys, one from present-day Britain and one from 90s Britain, looking at what it meant to be black British. And I mixed in all sorts of music \u2013 as it\u2019s named after a garage song, I made sure the garage was flowing. How important is music to you? It\u2019s another character in my work. The reason I chose [Shanks &amp; Bigfoot\u2019s 1999 track] Sweet Like Chocolate is because it\u2019s my favourite song. But also the lyrics mean two things to me: number one, I am brilliant \u2013 to be black and British is a beautiful thing, even when it\u2019s been hard. But it also made me realise that your identity can very much be consumed and devoured, to the point where you are seen as confectionery. You\u2019ve worked as an actor too. What prompted the move to directing? I still love acting, but I feel so in control when I\u2019m directing and writing \u2013 and I see the fruits of my labour. It gives you more control over what narratives you tell, too. Do we still see stereotyped or limited roles for young black men? I will never say to a black person \u201cnobody needs to hear that story\u201d, because it\u2019s hard out here as it is. But you need to actually listen to a varied selection of black creatives, and give black people the keys to the building, and then you\u2019ll see a varied selection of stories. But there\u2019s also the question about whether people actually do want to hear them or they\u2019re just running their mouth\u2026 Are some people in charge of theatres just running their mouths? Oh yes, absolutely. It\u2019s a tick-box exercise right now. It\u2019s a good way of getting some funding. I think we, as people, need to be better at sussing it out \u2013 and taking our money away from them. Are we currently seeing a change in the people who get the keys? Artistic directors diversifying is a fantastic thing. But it\u2019s not enough. It\u2019s about the executive producers as well \u2013 the people handling money, all facets of the industry. What shows have you always wanted to stage? I would love to do a play by Marcus Gardley. And I\u2019d like to do more shows by black British writers across the regions. If Brexit\u2019s taught us anything, it\u2019s that we need to be looking outside of London.",

I wish he had been right. But unfortunately, there was too much focus on the great firewall of China and not enough on how the Chinese Communist party was trying to shape its external environment.</p> <p><strong>When did China pivot from seeing the internet as a US-generated threat to something </strong><strong>it could use to discipline and punish its own population?</strong><br>It\u2019s not just the internet, it\u2019s technology in general. If you go back to even the late 1970s and early 80s, the way the Chinese Communist party (CCP) talks about technology is as a tool of social management. It\u2019s a way of not only coercive control, but also sort of cooperative control where you participate in your own management. It\u2019s this idea of shaping the environment, shaping how people think, how they\u2019re willing to act before they even know they\u2019re making a choice. That\u2019s the party\u2019s idea.</p> <p><strong>When did that </strong><strong>develop into what is called the social credit system?</strong><br>Former Chinese leader Jiang Zemin spoke<strong> </strong>about this in 2000. He said we need a social credit system to merge rule by law and rule by virtue. I don\u2019t see it as different from the way Hannah Arendt describes how regimes attempt to make the law inseparable from ethics in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/feb/01/totalitarianism-in-age-donald-trump-lessons-from-hannah-arendt-protests\" title=\"\">The Origins of Totalitarianism</a></em>.</p> <p><strong>How does the social credit system work </strong><strong>for the average citizen? As they are going about their lives, are they continually earning and losing points</strong><strong> based on</strong><strong> their behaviour?</strong><br>A pop cultural reference might be the <em>Black Mirror</em> episode <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/21/black-mirror-review-charlie-brooker-nightmare-sterile-world-is-only-five-minutes-away\" title=\"\">Nosedive</a>. But it isn\u2019t the same. It\u2019s not really a number score that goes up and down. There are multiple inputs. So you have, say, legal inputs, like a court record, and financial inputs. Then there are third-party inputs, such as surveillance video or data about your sentiment on social media. The system includes blacklists, records on public websites, and platforms to support decisions on creditworthiness that integrate things like \u201csentiment analysis\u201d. This applies to companies and individuals. Muji\u2019s Shanghai branch had a mark of dishonesty on its credit record with the Shanghai government because one of its products was labelled \u201cMade in Taiwan\u201d.</p> <p><strong>The number of people affected</strong><strong> is enormous: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/01/china-bans-23m-discredited-citizens-from-buying-travel-tickets-social-credit-system\" title=\"\">17.5 million people were prevented from buying flights in 2018</a>. Is there much pushback from the Chinese population about this system?</strong><br>An average person might not see how it\u2019s affecting them yet. Social credit is technology augmenting existing control methods. So if you\u2019re used to that system, you aren\u2019t necessarily seeing the change yet. Blacklists aren\u2019t new, but the technology supporting this social management is. And over time, as it becomes more effective, that\u2019s where more people will notice the impact.</p> <p><strong>So there isn\u2019t much concept of user privacy or anonymising data in China?</strong><br>Privacy matters to the average Chinese citizen and there are privacy regulations in place. But privacy stops where the party\u2019s power begins. And so, you know, the party state might put controls on how companies can share data. But again privacy stops where the party\u2019s power begins. And that\u2019s a huge difference in the system.</p> <p>One thing that\u2019s interesting to keep in mind is the system itself. When we think about China\u2019s authoritarianism, we think about surveillance cameras, we think about facial recognition. But we forget that a lot of the technology involved provides convenience.

      "body": "<p>Here\u2019s a question. Well, two questions, actually. One: how could an aircraft manufacturer long celebrated for its commitment to engineering excellence produce an airliner with aerodynamic characteristics that made it unstable under some circumstances \u2013 and then release it with remedial computer software that appeared to make it difficult for pilots to take control? And two: why did the government regulator approve the plane \u2013 and then dither about grounding the model after it had crashed?</p> <p>The aircraft in question is the Boeing 737 Max. The regulator is the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The questions are urgent because this model has crashed twice \u2013 first in the Java Sea last October with the deaths of 189 people, and then in Ethiopia in March with the deaths of 157 people. Evidence retrieved from the second crash site suggested that the plane had been <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/french-start-analysis-ethiopian-airlines-black-boxes-as-new-evidence-appears/2019/03/15/87770e8c-468f-11e9-94ab-d2dda3c0df52_story.html\" title=\"\">configured to dive</a> before it came down. And the Ethiopian transport minister was quoted by Al-Jazeera on 4 April as saying that the crew \u201cperformed all the procedures repeatedly provided by the manufacturer but was not able to control the aircraft\u201d. The FAA initially reaffirmed the airworthiness of the plane on 11 March but then <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737_MAX#Accidents_and_incidents\" title=\"\">grounded it</a> on 13 March. </p> <p>The full story of this catastrophe remains to be told, but we already know the outlines of it. Like many other spectacular failures \u2013 for example the Nasa Challenger disaster in 1986 \u2013 it involves the interaction of lots of factors. As Diane Vaughan found in her <a href=\"https://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/C/bo22781921.html\" title=\"\">monumental study of Challenger</a>, technology, organisational culture and commercial (or, sometimes, political) considerations are all involved. And therefore the 737 Max story has lessons that go way beyond aircraft manufacture.</p> <p>The 737 Max was Boeing\u2019s response to the A320neo aircraft <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_between_Airbus_and_Boeing\" title=\"\">made by its only competitor</a> \u2013 Airbus. Originally, the intention was to design a new plane from scratch, but Boeing\u2019s management decided instead just to modify its existing 737 model, principally by adding two new, more fuel-efficient, engines.</p> <p>These engines were so large, however, that they couldn\u2019t be hung under the wing without scraping the ground. The solution was to mount them up and in front of the wing. But this had some serious implications. According to <a href=\"http://www.b737.org.uk/mcas.htm\" title=\"\">Boeing\u2019s technical documentation</a>, the new location and larger nacelle (the engine casing) \u201ccause the vortex flow off the nacelle body to produce lift at high AoA [angles of attack]. As the nacelle is ahead of the C of G [centre of gravity], this lift causes a slight pitch-up effect \u2026 which could lead the pilot to inadvertently pull the yoke further aft than intended bringing the aircraft closer towards the stall.\u201d</p> <p>The solution to this intrinsic aerodynamic instability was to add a new software component called MCAS (Manoeuvring Characteristics Augmentation System) to the flight-control system. This would turn down the nose of the plane whenever an AoA sensor in the nose detected an impending stall, regardless of the speed. Crucially, however, it seems that the new software was linked to only one of the two AoA sensors, and no provision was made for it to check with the sensor on the other side. So, <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/154944/boeing-737-max-investigation-indonesia-lion-air-ethiopian-airlines-managerial-revolution\" title=\"\">as one analysis puts it</a>, \u201cthe system was programmed to turn the nose down at the feedback of a single (and somewhat flimsy) sensor\u201d \u2013 and to do that repeatedly. Which may explain why the pilots on the two fatal flights were unable to overcome their computerised hijacker.</p> <p>This flaw was probably an honest mistake and one that would normally have been picked up in the certification process operated by the FAA. But it wasn\u2019t, and here the story gets murky.</p> <p>There are two strands to it. The first is how the organisational culture of Boeing had changed over the years since it acquired McDonnell Douglas, a failing aerospace contractor, in 1997. Boeing\u2019s organisational culture is <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/danpontefract/2019/03/18/boeings-737-max-crisis-is-a-leadership-issue/#959f3556a0ac\" title=\"\">now radically different</a> from its old engineering-led ethos.

      "body": "<p>Life has been quite a trip for Sir Richard Branson so far, and this weekend will be no exception as he flies to the US from Tel Aviv via London with space rockets on his mind. </p> <p>He is heading to Wall Street to ring the opening bell on the New York Stock Exchange as his spaceflight company, Virgin Galactic, becomes a listed company tomorrow.</p> <p>Speaking to the <em>Observer</em> on board Virgin Atlantic\u2019s inaugural flight from London to Tel Aviv last week, Branson revisited his long-delayed promise: \u201cNext year I hope to be floating in space.\u201d</p> <p>There is a certain urgency. It is 35 years since he launched his airline, Virgin Atlantic, and Branson is contemplating his 70th birthday next year. While apparently he hasn\u2019t tired of hamming it up for the cameras, there is perhaps a little less spring in his step. But he remains Virgin\u2019s rock-star draw on the Tel Aviv trip. </p> <p>Brexit is a particular source of sadness. \u201cIt must have become apparent to most people in the last three-and-a-half years just what a mistake it was,\u201d Branson says. \u201cIn my ideal world there should be another referendum. If a soft Brexit happens, it won\u2019t bankrupt the country \u2013 but it will be very sad for young people, who won\u2019t be able to live or work in these beautiful countries.\u201d</p> <p>He attributes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/thomascookgroup\" title=\"\">Thomas Cook</a>\u2019s demise directly to the Brexit vote, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/02/everything-you-need-to-know-monarch-airlines-collapse-explainer\" title=\"\">Monarch</a>\u2019s likewise, \u201cand Flybe we picked up for a pound\u201d. A hard Brexit would do irreparable damage to Britain, he says, but those airlines had already suffered too much from the 20% drop in the value of the pound. \u201cAll their costs would have been in dollars \u2013 maintenance, leasing, fuel \u2013 and less people could travel overseas.\u201d</p> <p>Virgin Atlantic is another airline failing to make a profit, but it is not in danger, Branson says. \u201cWe are survivors. And it\u2019s got the advantage of other Virgin companies: if the worst comes to the worst we can help it out, occasionally.\u201d</p> <p>The airline is now backed (or controlled, rivals say) by US giant Delta. \u201cNo question, Delta have been fantastic partners,\u201d says Branson, whose <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/27/richard-branson-cedes-control-of-virgin-atlantic\" title=\"\">sale of his majority stake to Air France-KLM</a> has yet to get full regulatory approval.</p> <p>Expansion to new routes has been off the agenda until recently, but now Virgin is planning on growth: back to Mumbai, adding S\u00e3o Paulo in Brazil, as well as the new Israel route. Sensitivities are such that cabin crew were sent for cultural awareness training among the Jewish community in Golders Green, north London. Last year, the airline took \u201cPalestinian couscous\u201d off the inflight menu. Branson says he wasn\u2019t aware of the couscous controversy, but \u201cif it was done for political reasons, I would say it was a mistake\u201d.</p> <p>Domestically, he remains animated by Virgin Atlantic\u2019s push to engage the old enemy, British Airways, at Heathrow. Branson and Virgin have informally aligned with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/23/heathrow-accuses-ba-acting-against-uk-consumer-interests\" title=\"\">airport\u2019s management against BA</a> to build the third runway and get more slots. </p> <p>\u201cOur team punch above its weight out of Heathrow but BA should have a competitor that has 35-40% [of slots] at least \u2026 We\u2019re going to fight our corner.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"92787ef43cbd2bc112bbf982b90a80fe9dff0b74\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/92787ef43cbd2bc112bbf982b90a80fe9dff0b74/0_132_1796_1078/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Virgin Galactic test flight in the Mojave desert last year\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Virgin Galactic test flight in the Mojave desert last year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Virgin Galactic/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Meanwhile, the climate emergency has enveloped aviation. BA recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/10/british-airways-offset-domestic-flight-emissions-from-next-year\" title=\"\">pledged to reach net-zero emissions</a> by 2050, and Branson says Virgin will do the same: \u201cWe have said we\u2019re going to go net zero by 2050, we\u2019ve been very clear, and I think we should try to make it less than that.\u201d (Virgin Atlantic\u2019s chief executive, Shai Weiss, is more coy: \u201cWe\u2019ve kind of said it.\u201d)</p> <p>In Branson\u2019s view, \u201crealistically, people are not going to stop flying \u2013 the most avid of marchers are going to fly. What\u2019s critical is that we enable them to fly as environmentally friendly as possible.\u201d</p> <p>He says there is a \u201cwhole list of things\u201d that Virgin is doing. \u201cI\u2019m lobbying to get government to impose the equivalent of a carbon tax on all companies in Britain, to have the companies invest 100% of that money directly into green energy investment.\u201d He has championed LanzaTech, \u201ca wonderful company that turn waste from aluminium and steel [processing] into aviation fuel. They need billions to build more factories.\u201d More modern planes are cutting Virgin\u2019s fuel burn by 25-30%. And, he adds, \u201cby the time we get those slots at Heathrow, hopefully some short-haul planes will be completely battery-driven\u201d.</p> <p>Is this wishful thinking? \u201cThey are not hypotheticals, it\u2019s just getting the quantity. We need to make sure we get the trillions and trillions needed to speed up the processes of all these things.\u201d</p> <p>He remains resolutely positive: \u201cSome people think that every other problem apart from aviation in the world will be ticked, and aviation will never be ticked. I disagree: I think aviation can also be carbon neutral, and sooner than people realise.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, fresh adventures remain on planet Earth. Next month Branson will join the sea trials off Marseille of Virgin\u2019s first cruise ship, pitching his lone vessel to \u2013 once again \u2013 disrupt a market dominated by two or three big players.</p> <p>And his optimism remains undimmed. Next time you are in the US, he says, don\u2019t just hop over to the Mojave desert to see the Galactic set-up \u2013 \u201cstunning, beautiful rockets\u201d \u2013 but also go and see Hyperloop One \u2013 the magnetically propelled high-speed transport system being developed with the aim of moving people and things at airline speeds on the ground. Its test track in Nevada could be followed by a full-scale project in India, pending approval: \u201cWe\u2019ve got the first track we\u2019re building soon, between Mumbai to Pune.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s definitely going to work.\u201d</p> <h2>Branson\u2019s businesses</h2> <p><strong>Virgin Atlantic</strong><br>Launched in 1984, the airline was successful for many years but has struggled recently. Branson cashed in by selling 49% to Singapore Airways for \u00a3600m in 1999 and in 2017 he agreed to sell 31% to Air France-KLM.</p> <p><strong>Virgin Records</strong><br>The young Branson founded his record label in the early 70s. Its first release was Mike Oldfield\u2019s global hit LP Tubular Bells. It then signed the Sex Pistols and 80s names such as Culture Club before being sold in 1992 for a reported $1bn.</p> <p><strong>Virgin Trains</strong><br>Virgin received more than \u00a3300m in dividends during its 22-year operation of the London-Glasgow line. In April, Branson protested when the government refused to approve its partner, Stagecoach, for rail franchise bids. Now the name will vanish from UK rail.</p> <p><strong>Virgin Money</strong><br>Branson bought the remnants of Northern Rock in 2011 for \u00a3747m and merged it with his financial firm. It was sold last year to the owner of Clydesdale and Yorkshire banks for \u00a31.7bn but will pay to use the Virgin brand.</p> <p><strong>Virgin Brides</strong><br>Launched in 1996 with a shot of Branson in a wedding dress, the one-stop marriage shop was the idea of a member of Virgin Atlantic\u2019s cabin crew. It closed in 2007. \u201cMaybe it was the picture that put people off,\u201d he said.</p> <p><strong>Virgin Cola</strong><br>Branson rammed a tank into a wall of Coke cans in New York in 1998 to launch this venture in the US. But Virgin\u2019s version offered nothing new and Coke applied pressure to distributors. Branson concluded: \u201cDeclaring a soft drink war on Coke was madness.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Virgin Vie</strong><br>In 1997 Branson predicted his cosmetics line would be in 100 high street stores within five years. The venture never took off and in 2009 Virgin paid \u00a38.8m and wrote off \u00a321m of debt for new owners to take over.</p> <p><strong>Virgin America</strong><br>Branson launched his domestic US airline in 2007 because flying in the US was \u201cawful\u201d. It was sold to Alaska Airlines in 2016 for $2.6bn against his wishes. Still, he received about \u00a3550m from the sale.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Life has been quite a trip for Sir Richard Branson so far, and this weekend will be no exception as he flies to the US from Tel Aviv via London with space rockets on his mind. He is heading to Wall Street to ring the opening bell on the New York Stock Exchange as his spaceflight company, Virgin Galactic, becomes a listed company tomorrow. Speaking to the Observer on board Virgin Atlantic\u2019s inaugural flight from London to Tel Aviv last week, Branson revisited his long-delayed promise: \u201cNext year I hope to be floating in space.\u201d There is a certain urgency. It is 35 years since he launched his airline, Virgin Atlantic, and Branson is contemplating his 70th birthday next year. While apparently he hasn\u2019t tired of hamming it up for the cameras, there is perhaps a little less spring in his step. But he remains Virgin\u2019s rock-star draw on the Tel Aviv trip. Brexit is a particular source of sadness. \u201cIt must have become apparent to most people in the last three-and-a-half years just what a mistake it was,\u201d Branson says. \u201cIn my ideal world there should be another referendum. If a soft Brexit happens, it won\u2019t bankrupt the country \u2013 but it will be very sad for young people, who won\u2019t be able to live or work in these beautiful countries.\u201d He attributes Thomas Cook\u2019s demise directly to the Brexit vote, Monarch\u2019s likewise, \u201cand Flybe we picked up for a pound\u201d. A hard Brexit would do irreparable damage to Britain, he says, but those airlines had already suffered too much from the 20% drop in the value of the pound. \u201cAll their costs would have been in dollars \u2013 maintenance, leasing, fuel \u2013 and less people could travel overseas.\u201d Virgin Atlantic is another airline failing to make a profit, but it is not in danger, Branson says. \u201cWe are survivors. And it\u2019s got the advantage of other Virgin companies: if the worst comes to the worst we can help it out, occasionally.\u201d The airline is now backed (or controlled, rivals say) by US giant Delta. \u201cNo question, Delta have been fantastic partners,\u201d says Branson, whose sale of his majority stake to Air France-KLM has yet to get full regulatory approval. Expansion to new routes has been off the agenda until recently, but now Virgin is planning on growth: back to Mumbai, adding S\u00e3o Paulo in Brazil, as well as the new Israel route. Sensitivities are such that cabin crew were sent for cultural awareness training among the Jewish community in Golders Green, north London. Last year, the airline took \u201cPalestinian couscous\u201d off the inflight menu. Branson says he wasn\u2019t aware of the couscous controversy, but \u201cif it was done for political reasons, I would say it was a mistake\u201d. Domestically, he remains animated by Virgin Atlantic\u2019s push to engage the old enemy, British Airways, at Heathrow. Branson and Virgin have informally aligned with the airport\u2019s management against BA to build the third runway and get more slots. \u201cOur team punch above its weight out of Heathrow but BA should have a competitor that has 35-40% [of slots] at least \u2026 We\u2019re going to fight our corner.\u201d Meanwhile, the climate emergency has enveloped aviation. BA recently pledged to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, and Branson says Virgin will do the same: \u201cWe have said we\u2019re going to go net zero by 2050, we\u2019ve been very clear, and I think we should try to make it less than that.\u201d (Virgin Atlantic\u2019s chief executive, Shai Weiss, is more coy: \u201cWe\u2019ve kind of said it.\u201d) In Branson\u2019s view, \u201crealistically, people are not going to stop flying \u2013 the most avid of marchers are going to fly. What\u2019s critical is that we enable them to fly as environmentally friendly as possible.\u201d He says there is a \u201cwhole list of things\u201d that Virgin is doing. \u201cI\u2019m lobbying to get government to impose the equivalent of a carbon tax on all companies in Britain, to have the companies invest 100% of that money directly into green energy investment.\u201d He has championed LanzaTech, \u201ca wonderful company that turn waste from aluminium and steel [processing] into aviation fuel. They need billions to build more factories.\u201d More modern planes are cutting Virgin\u2019s fuel burn by 25-30%. And, he adds, \u201cby the time we get those slots at Heathrow, hopefully some short-haul planes will be completely battery-driven\u201d. Is this wishful thinking? \u201cThey are not hypotheticals, it\u2019s just getting the quantity. We need to make sure we get the trillions and trillions needed to speed up the processes of all these things.\u201d He remains resolutely positive: \u201cSome people think that every other problem apart from aviation in the world will be ticked, and aviation will never be ticked. I disagree: I think aviation can also be carbon neutral, and sooner than people realise.\u201d Meanwhile, fresh adventures remain on planet Earth. Next month Branson will join the sea trials off Marseille of Virgin\u2019s first cruise ship, pitching his lone vessel to \u2013 once again \u2013 disrupt a market dominated by two or three big players. And his optimism remains undimmed. Next time you are in the US, he says, don\u2019t just hop over to the Mojave desert to see the Galactic set-up \u2013 \u201cstunning, beautiful rockets\u201d \u2013 but also go and see Hyperloop One \u2013 the magnetically propelled high-speed transport system being developed with the aim of moving people and things at airline speeds on the ground. Its test track in Nevada could be followed by a full-scale project in India, pending approval: \u201cWe\u2019ve got the first track we\u2019re building soon, between Mumbai to Pune. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely going to work.\u201d Branson\u2019s businesses Virgin Atlantic Launched in 1984, the airline was successful for many years but has struggled recently. Branson cashed in by selling 49% to Singapore Airways for \u00a3600m in 1999 and in 2017 he agreed to sell 31% to Air France-KLM. Virgin Records The young Branson founded his record label in the early 70s. Its first release was Mike Oldfield\u2019s global hit LP Tubular Bells. It then signed the Sex Pistols and 80s names such as Culture Club before being sold in 1992 for a reported $1bn. Virgin Trains Virgin received more than \u00a3300m in dividends during its 22-year operation of the London-Glasgow line. In April, Branson protested when the government refused to approve its partner, Stagecoach, for rail franchise bids. Now the name will vanish from UK rail. Virgin Money Branson bought the remnants of Northern Rock in 2011 for \u00a3747m and merged it with his financial firm. It was sold last year to the owner of Clydesdale and Yorkshire banks for \u00a31.7bn but will pay to use the Virgin brand. Virgin Brides Launched in 1996 with a shot of Branson in a wedding dress, the one-stop marriage shop was the idea of a member of Virgin Atlantic\u2019s cabin crew. It closed in 2007. \u201cMaybe it was the picture that put people off,\u201d he said. Virgin Cola Branson rammed a tank into a wall of Coke cans in New York in 1998 to launch this venture in the US. But Virgin\u2019s version offered nothing new and Coke applied pressure to distributors. Branson concluded: \u201cDeclaring a soft drink war on Coke was madness.\u201d Virgin Vie In 1997 Branson predicted his cosmetics line would be in 100 high street stores within five years. The venture never took off and in 2009 Virgin paid \u00a38.8m and wrote off \u00a321m of debt for new owners to take over. Virgin America Branson launched his domestic US airline in 2007 because flying in the US was \u201cawful\u201d. It was sold to Alaska Airlines in 2016 for $2.6bn against his wishes. Still, he received about \u00a3550m from the sale.",

Shortly after a press conference outside Grays police station in Essex on Saturday, police in Ireland announced it had arrested a man in his early 20s at Dublin\u2019s port wanted in relation to the case. Four people arrested earlier in the week remain in custody. Asked whether the focus of the investigation had now shifted from the Chinese to Vietnamese community, after the force initially declared the victims were Chinese, DCI Martin Pasmore said: \u201cThe investigation hasn\u2019t shifted anywhere.

The force is liaising with Vietnamese authorities to agree a \u201cfast-track\u201d method to share fingerprints, and potentially even DNA from possible family members, to help identify the victims. \u201cIt may well be that there are people watching this tonight that are thinking \u2018I\u2019m here in the UK and I\u2019m here illegally and I want to come forward, I want to obviously try and identify my loved ones and be reunited\u2019, but they are frightened to come forward,\u201d Pasmore said.

He added that the Essex force was investigating lines of inquiry to \u201cestablish whether there is a wider conspiracy involved\u201d in the deaths of the people found in the refrigerated lorry. It comes as the Vietnamese prime minister ordered an investigation into human trafficking allegations surrounding the deaths of people who are believed to have been smuggled into the UK. The Vietnamese embassy in London has set up a hotline to help families seeking information about their loved ones following the tragedy, after a number of Vietnamese families came forward with information that their relatives may be among the victims.",

However, the city bounced back. \u201cThese events can damage the city\u2019s image but this conflict isn\u2019t going to continue for ever and we\u2019ll get back to normal,\u201d said Gabriel Jen\u00e9, president of Barcelona Oberta. \u201cWe\u2019re more worried about the ability of politicians to deal with the conflict than the capacity of the city to overcome it.\u201d",

Mary Shelley: her scandalous life will make must-see TV Nineteenth-century female authors might have had to pretend they were men in order to have their work published, but finally, at long last, now is the moment to be corseted, writerly and long dead. Apple is launching its TV subscription service with, among others, Dickinson, about the poet Emily, who would definitely have been on Tumblr and used black lipstick Instagram filters were she here to see the internet age. Now HBO has upped the stakes by ordering a pilot about my favourite, Mary Shelley, who lived such a biopic-friendly life it\u2019s a wonder there isn\u2019t a new film about her every year. As a teenager, she began an affair with Percy Bysshe Shelley, a married man, whose wife later killed herself; they fled the country while unmarried and travelled around Europe with her stepsister, who may or may not have been involved with Percy romantically. Then, when she was 18, she practically invented modern horror by writing Frankenstein, a novel so much richer than any plastic Halloween mask could ever begin to hint at. Somehow, this powder keg of a life was turned into a so-so film last year but the new series, The Shelley Society, sounds like it will be far less faithful to history and more indebted to the spirit of this incredible woman.

      "body": "<p>In the two years and four months since the country awoke to horrific images of a burning tower block, Edward Daffarn has \u201clived and breathed Grenfell 24 hours a day\u201d. Efforts to find some normality \u2013 reading a novel, going to the cinema, playing sports \u2013 have had little success. The other day, while visiting an art gallery with a cousin, a fire alarm went off. \u201cThat freaked me out. I\u2019m not good with alarms and sirens. The only way I can escape Grenfell is by leaving the country,\u201d he says.</p> <p>For Daffarn, who escaped from the 16th floor of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/grenfell-tower-fire\" title=\"\">Grenfell Tower</a> in the early hours of 14 June 2017, the trauma \u2013 and the battle for truth and justice \u2013 has never diminished while, inevitably, public attention has gone elsewhere. But on 30 October the first <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/04/grenfell-tower-report-to-be-released-a-day-before-brexit-deadline\" title=\"\">report of the public inquiry</a> into the tragedy which claimed 72 lives will bring the appalling events of the night sharply back into focus.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a very significant moment for us,\u201d says Daffarn, 57, a key figure in <a href=\"https://www.grenfellunited.org.uk\" title=\"\">Grenfell United</a>, which represents survivors and the bereaved. He was also the co-author of a community blog that, seven months before the fire, warned: \u201c<a href=\"https://grenfellactiongroup.wordpress.com/2016/11/20/kctmo-playing-with-fire/\" title=\"\">Only a catastrophic event will expose the ineptitude and incompetence of our landlord</a>.\u201d</p> <p>Phase one of the public inquiry, chaired by the retired judge <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jun/29/sir-martin-moore-bick-grenfell-tower-inquiry-profile\" title=\"\">Sir Martin Moore-Bick</a>, examined the events of the night, including how the fire started in a fourth-floor flat and spread to the top of the building in less than 30 minutes, and the response of the fire brigade and other emergency services. Phase two, due to start in January, will investigate the lead-up to the fire, including decisions made by the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, the tower\u2019s landlord, the Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation (KCTMO), architects and contractors.</p> <p>This week\u2019s report will draw on seven months of hearings, including testimony from survivors, families and the emergency services, and 200,000 documents. \u201cIt\u2019s very personal to us, but it\u2019s important to the whole country. After all, we don\u2019t live in dangerous buildings any more, but thousands of people go to sleep at night in homes effectively covered with liquid paraffin,\u201d says Daffarn. \u201cThe fact is that this catastrophe was predictable. There was a series of forces in play that led to this. Accidents do happen, but this wasn\u2019t an accident.\u201d</p> <p>In the hours after the blaze, Daffarn\u2019s blog, spurred by \u201crage at the sheer injustice of how we were treated\u201d, recorded some three million hits, earning him the epithet the \u201cprophet of Grenfell\u201d. \u201cEverything you need to know about Grenfell is contained within the pages of that blog,\u201d he says.</p> <p>He lived in Flat 134 of Grenfell Tower for 16 years. \u201cWe had a beautiful community; people from different cultural backgrounds, all different races and different financial backgrounds. We all lived in one block side by side and got along well. We often joked that the reason why we knew each other so well was because we spent so long waiting in the foyer because of the defective lifts,\u201d he said in his witness statement to the inquiry.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bdcb416e678c987349f89a497ccffa7ce0bec5f8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bdcb416e678c987349f89a497ccffa7ce0bec5f8/0_478_3744_3742/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Edward Daffarn\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Edward Daffarn co-authored a community blog which had warned of the risk of fire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karen Robinson/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On the night of the fire, he was listening to the radio in bed when he heard his neighbour Joe\u2019s smoke alarm go off. \u201cI assumed Joe had burnt some toast or something,\u201d his statement said. But then he heard shouting. He got out of bed, opened his door a fraction. \u201cThe whole hallway outside my flat was full of black and white smoke all mixed together.\u201d</p> <p>His instinct was to stay in the flat, but another neighbour phoned him to tell him to get out quickly. With a wet towel wrapped around his face, he opened his front door again. \u201cI couldn\u2019t see beyond the end of my nose \u2026 The smoke was aggressive and bellowing against me.\u201d Panicking, disorientated, and thinking he was about to die, he was grabbed by a firefighter and helped to find the stairwell. \u201cI ran for my life,\u201d he told the inquiry.</p> <p>Speaking to the <em>Observer</em>, he describes Grenfell as \u201ca tragedy in three acts: a community ignored and abused; the trauma of that awful night; and the aftermath \u2013 being abandoned by the state\u201d. He talks cautiously about justice. \u201cJustice is a word that has a different meaning for each person,\u201d he says. \u201cSay half a dozen people go to prison and social policy changes for the better \u2013 will that bring us justice?\u201d And: \u201cJustice can\u2019t bring back the people we lost, it can\u2019t replace our community.\u201d</p> <p>Nevertheless, Daffarn is hoping for some specific outcomes in this week\u2019s report. \u201cOne of the most important things is that Moore-Bick finds the building was non-compliant with regulations. If he does, then phase two can concentrate on which corporate bodies were responsible. If he doesn\u2019t, phase two will be mired in uncertainty.\u201d</p> <p>He also wants to see \u201cclear exoneration\u201d of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/06/grenfell-tower-inqury-kitchen-fire-resident-behailu-kebede-media-scapegoat\" title=\"\">Behailu Kebede</a>, in whose fourth-floor flat the fire started and who was vilified in some media reports in the days after the inferno.</p> <p>Daffarn expects the actions and decisions by the London Fire Brigade to be closely examined. \u201cIt\u2019s really unhelpful that this issue is looked at through the prism of heroes and villains. We need to know about the management, policies, training and advice, and how all these things contributed.</p> <p>\u201cMy life was saved by a brave firefighter. But at the same time there are many questions \u2013 the risk assessment of buildings, the radios that didn\u2019t work, the \u2018stay put\u2019 policy [residents were told to stay in their flats and await rescue rather than escape the building]. When I came out of the building at 1.37am, there were numerous people shouting up to those inside, telling them to get out. That tells its own story.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f1282432e2a41b1e56856d8228ab2b951805deb9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f1282432e2a41b1e56856d8228ab2b951805deb9/0_93_3500_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Messages of condolence at the base of Grenfell Tower.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Messages of condolence at the base of Grenfell Tower.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hannah McKay/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s vitally important that we understand why the stay put policy was in place for as long as it was [the advice was abandoned two hours after the first 999 call], and why we weren\u2019t evacuated sooner.\u201d</p> <p>He also wants to see the \u201cbehaviour and culture\u201d of KCTMO, the company that managed the tower, scrutinised in the report. \u201cWe were up against an incredibly powerful and incredibly abusive non-functioning mini-mafia, and I hope and pray that by the end of the inquiry this is widely known.\u201d</p> <p>The visceral anger of survivors and bereaved relatives, which was vented in distressing and frustrating community meetings with officials in the aftermath of fire, has not dissipated, he says. \u201cIt\u2019s still raw. The anger is valid and authentic but it needs to be channelled into bringing change.\u201d</p> <p>Daffarn was a mental health social worker until he took time out to care for his sick mother, and later his stepfather. Over the last couple of years, he has spent about 120 hours in police interviews, and now is devoting much of his time with his solicitor preparing to give evidence to phase two of the inquiry. He also has regular counselling.</p> <p>He struggles to imagine a time when his life could move beyond Grenfell. \u201cAll of us [survivors] are on different paths. Some went back to work really quickly. For me, it\u2019s like I\u2019m on a train journey and though there have been plenty of times I want to get off, I have to follow through to the end.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re determined not to be remembered for the way we were treated before the fire, but for the changes we bring. Our next fight will be to ensure the report\u2019s recommendations are implemented and not swept under the carpet. We\u2019re already steeling ourselves for the next part of this battle.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "In the two years and four months since the country awoke to horrific images of a burning tower block, Edward Daffarn has \u201clived and breathed Grenfell 24 hours a day\u201d. Efforts to find some normality \u2013 reading a novel, going to the cinema, playing sports \u2013 have had little success. The other day, while visiting an art gallery with a cousin, a fire alarm went off. \u201cThat freaked me out. I\u2019m not good with alarms and sirens. The only way I can escape Grenfell is by leaving the country,\u201d he says. For Daffarn, who escaped from the 16th floor of Grenfell Tower in the early hours of 14 June 2017, the trauma \u2013 and the battle for truth and justice \u2013 has never diminished while, inevitably, public attention has gone elsewhere. But on 30 October the first report of the public inquiry into the tragedy which claimed 72 lives will bring the appalling events of the night sharply back into focus. \u201cThis is a very significant moment for us,\u201d says Daffarn, 57, a key figure in Grenfell United, which represents survivors and the bereaved. He was also the co-author of a community blog that, seven months before the fire, warned: \u201cOnly a catastrophic event will expose the ineptitude and incompetence of our landlord.\u201d Phase one of the public inquiry, chaired by the retired judge Sir Martin Moore-Bick, examined the events of the night, including how the fire started in a fourth-floor flat and spread to the top of the building in less than 30 minutes, and the response of the fire brigade and other emergency services. Phase two, due to start in January, will investigate the lead-up to the fire, including decisions made by the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, the tower\u2019s landlord, the Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation (KCTMO), architects and contractors. This week\u2019s report will draw on seven months of hearings, including testimony from survivors, families and the emergency services, and 200,000 documents. \u201cIt\u2019s very personal to us, but it\u2019s important to the whole country. After all, we don\u2019t live in dangerous buildings any more, but thousands of people go to sleep at night in homes effectively covered with liquid paraffin,\u201d says Daffarn. \u201cThe fact is that this catastrophe was predictable. There was a series of forces in play that led to this. Accidents do happen, but this wasn\u2019t an accident.\u201d In the hours after the blaze, Daffarn\u2019s blog, spurred by \u201crage at the sheer injustice of how we were treated\u201d, recorded some three million hits, earning him the epithet the \u201cprophet of Grenfell\u201d. \u201cEverything you need to know about Grenfell is contained within the pages of that blog,\u201d he says. He lived in Flat 134 of Grenfell Tower for 16 years. \u201cWe had a beautiful community; people from different cultural backgrounds, all different races and different financial backgrounds. We all lived in one block side by side and got along well. We often joked that the reason why we knew each other so well was because we spent so long waiting in the foyer because of the defective lifts,\u201d he said in his witness statement to the inquiry. On the night of the fire, he was listening to the radio in bed when he heard his neighbour Joe\u2019s smoke alarm go off. \u201cI assumed Joe had burnt some toast or something,\u201d his statement said. But then he heard shouting. He got out of bed, opened his door a fraction. \u201cThe whole hallway outside my flat was full of black and white smoke all mixed together.\u201d His instinct was to stay in the flat, but another neighbour phoned him to tell him to get out quickly. With a wet towel wrapped around his face, he opened his front door again. \u201cI couldn\u2019t see beyond the end of my nose \u2026 The smoke was aggressive and bellowing against me.\u201d Panicking, disorientated, and thinking he was about to die, he was grabbed by a firefighter and helped to find the stairwell. \u201cI ran for my life,\u201d he told the inquiry. Speaking to the Observer, he describes Grenfell as \u201ca tragedy in three acts: a community ignored and abused; the trauma of that awful night; and the aftermath \u2013 being abandoned by the state\u201d. He talks cautiously about justice. \u201cJustice is a word that has a different meaning for each person,\u201d he says. \u201cSay half a dozen people go to prison and social policy changes for the better \u2013 will that bring us justice?\u201d And: \u201cJustice can\u2019t bring back the people we lost, it can\u2019t replace our community.\u201d Nevertheless, Daffarn is hoping for some specific outcomes in this week\u2019s report. \u201cOne of the most important things is that Moore-Bick finds the building was non-compliant with regulations. If he does, then phase two can concentrate on which corporate bodies were responsible. If he doesn\u2019t, phase two will be mired in uncertainty.\u201d He also wants to see \u201cclear exoneration\u201d of Behailu Kebede, in whose fourth-floor flat the fire started and who was vilified in some media reports in the days after the inferno. Daffarn expects the actions and decisions by the London Fire Brigade to be closely examined. \u201cIt\u2019s really unhelpful that this issue is looked at through the prism of heroes and villains. We need to know about the management, policies, training and advice, and how all these things contributed. \u201cMy life was saved by a brave firefighter. But at the same time there are many questions \u2013 the risk assessment of buildings, the radios that didn\u2019t work, the \u2018stay put\u2019 policy [residents were told to stay in their flats and await rescue rather than escape the building]. When I came out of the building at 1.37am, there were numerous people shouting up to those inside, telling them to get out. That tells its own story. \u201cIt\u2019s vitally important that we understand why the stay put policy was in place for as long as it was [the advice was abandoned two hours after the first 999 call], and why we weren\u2019t evacuated sooner.\u201d He also wants to see the \u201cbehaviour and culture\u201d of KCTMO, the company that managed the tower, scrutinised in the report. \u201cWe were up against an incredibly powerful and incredibly abusive non-functioning mini-mafia, and I hope and pray that by the end of the inquiry this is widely known.\u201d The visceral anger of survivors and bereaved relatives, which was vented in distressing and frustrating community meetings with officials in the aftermath of fire, has not dissipated, he says. \u201cIt\u2019s still raw. The anger is valid and authentic but it needs to be channelled into bringing change.\u201d Daffarn was a mental health social worker until he took time out to care for his sick mother, and later his stepfather. Over the last couple of years, he has spent about 120 hours in police interviews, and now is devoting much of his time with his solicitor preparing to give evidence to phase two of the inquiry. He also has regular counselling. He struggles to imagine a time when his life could move beyond Grenfell. \u201cAll of us [survivors] are on different paths. Some went back to work really quickly. For me, it\u2019s like I\u2019m on a train journey and though there have been plenty of times I want to get off, I have to follow through to the end. \u201cWe\u2019re determined not to be remembered for the way we were treated before the fire, but for the changes we bring. Our next fight will be to ensure the report\u2019s recommendations are implemented and not swept under the carpet. We\u2019re already steeling ourselves for the next part of this battle.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>One scene in Alice Birch\u2019s new play would alone make the journey to the Donmar worthwhile. It is a feast scene \u2013 and an all-women scene \u2013 and in its apparently leisurely way it\u2019s as provoking and unexpected as the celebrated banquet in Caryl Churchill\u2019s <em>Top Girls</em>.</p> <p>A lawyer is bringing her new girlfriend to meet old friends. These include a headteacher, a therapist and a documentary film-maker. One of them owns a flat in Berlin. One of them gets her dealer to bring round some coke. They talk about labneh and yoga and doing good in Bolivia. There are early ripples of satire, cleverly muted but cleverly rippling. There is at the centre a galvanising, totally surprising, not-to-be disclosed incident: it involves wee, and not in a good way. Crucially, though, the scene, taking on a woman excited by the idea of hashtagging along to #MeToo, delivers a dexterously argued attack not only on liberal smugness \u2013 you might have seen that coming \u2013 but on the evacuation of hard political content, of talk about systems as well as individuals, from so-called political discussion. You don\u2019t often hear this. You might say Birch works a minor revolution, were it not that the term \u201crevolution\u201d is here so ably inspected, dissected \u2013 and judged mostly to be misused.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.donmarwarehouse.com/production/7193/blank\" title=\"\">[Blank]</a> </strong>marks the 40th anniversary of Clean Break, the theatre company that works with women affected by the criminal justice system. Other scenes are jagged shards. A woman breaks into her mother\u2019s home to find money. In a prison cell, a woman asks for her television to be taken away: she knows how to electrocute herself with it: \u201cit\u2019s a straightforward activity\u201d. An official \u2013 inexperienced and nervous \u2013 visits a woman she has not met before to tell her that her daughter is dead; she has hanged herself. On Rosie Elnile\u2019s pale, boxed design, these scenes \u2013 in which the character\u2019s names are those of the actors \u2013 are not continuous, but they are linked by common difficulties, recurring themes.</p> <p>Together, one of the questions they raise is to what extent the damage caused to these women \u2013 and their children \u2013 is an unbreakable chain of harm: whether what looks predetermined could have been stopped. Irony and paradox are at work, for there is nothing predestined about <em>[Blank]</em>. The scenes so well acted here have been selected by the director, Maria Aberg, from a collection of 100 (the play text runs to over 500 pages): Birch leaves it up to each new director to decide on the number and the order. As if, even with the most difficult of starts, you might have alternatives.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b8e3b5e06ff05ce90de0af94430fd599e0b2427d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b8e3b5e06ff05ce90de0af94430fd599e0b2427d/185_372_4797_2879/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Matt Smith and Claire Foy in Duncan Macmillan\u2019s Lungs at the Old Vic.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Matt Smith and Claire Foy in Duncan Macmillan\u2019s Lungs at the Old Vic: \u2018vibrantly well acted\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Helen Maybanks</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Choice \u2013 the chief luxury that comes with money \u2013 is at the core of <strong><a href=\"https://www.oldvictheatre.com/whats-on/2019/lungs\" title=\"\">Lungs</a></strong>, Duncan Macmillan\u2019s 2011 play in which a couple consider the pleasures and perils \u2013 for themselves and the planet \u2013 of having a baby. Like its fiancees \u2013 jittery but monogamous woman; sexually adventurous chap \u2013 it is a suprisingly conservative work from the dramatist who tore the stage apart with <em>People, Places and Things</em> and his adaptation of <em>1984</em>. But it\u2019s a surefire success: intricately, often dashingly written; sharply directed by Matthew Warchus and vibrantly well acted.</p> <p>Claire Foy and Matt Smith chuck the ermine and epaulettes they wore as that other couple in <em>The Crown</em>, in favour of dungarees (her) and T-shirt (him) in a similar soft grey: they could be best friends who have decided to dress like each other. Each provides a repertoire of distinctive gestures and mannerisms, which stops just short of stereotype. Her hands whir like little windmills; his shoulders shift and roll. She talks nonstop in breathless bursts, interrupting herself to plead: \u201cjust let me talk\u201d. He lounges and (probably) listens. Each skilfully slices, volleys and bounces Macmillan\u2019s lines: \u201cI want to split you apart\u2026\u201d he says a bit sheepishly. She comes back with: \u201cIn the right context, that\u2019s fine.\u201d At their most intense they are often far away from each other, lying back at opposite sides of a stage designed by Rob Howell from solar panels and glinting crystal slabs. The bare space doesn\u2019t change but is said to do so, often to witty effect: ooh, we are in a queue in Ikea; ooh, we are in bed; ooh, we are \u2013 finally, and in rather a tacked-on gabble \u2013 stumbling towards a care home.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e2727c099806774638b538656c67ed3a088aef3f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e2727c099806774638b538656c67ed3a088aef3f/556_0_3609_3609/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Siobhan Redmond in Vassa at the Almeida.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Coolly commanding\u2019: Siobhan Redmond in Vassa at the Almeida.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marc Brenner</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Since <em>Lungs</em> was first staged, its ecological concerns \u2013 the couple fret about avocados and plastic bags as well as the carbon footprint of a baby \u2013 have become more pressing.

This is an absorbing evening not because of any large environmental claims but because of the needling but generous dialogue that takes you into the heart of a couple.</p> <p>Mike Bartlett \u2013 writer of<em> King Charles III</em> and <em>Doctor Foster</em> \u2013 has adapted Maxim Gorky\u2019s 1910 attack on capitalism in tsarist Russia. <strong><a href=\"https://almeida.co.uk/whats-on/vassa/7-oct-2019-23-nov-2019\" title=\"\">Vassa</a> </strong>could be the perfect corrective to traditional Chekhov stagings. No one is wiltingly aristocratic; nearly everyone has a mercantile heart; a few characters are seriously scathed, but most are unremittingly scathing.

      "bodyText": "One scene in Alice Birch\u2019s new play would alone make the journey to the Donmar worthwhile. It is a feast scene \u2013 and an all-women scene \u2013 and in its apparently leisurely way it\u2019s as provoking and unexpected as the celebrated banquet in Caryl Churchill\u2019s Top Girls. A lawyer is bringing her new girlfriend to meet old friends. These include a headteacher, a therapist and a documentary film-maker. One of them owns a flat in Berlin. One of them gets her dealer to bring round some coke. They talk about labneh and yoga and doing good in Bolivia. There are early ripples of satire, cleverly muted but cleverly rippling. There is at the centre a galvanising, totally surprising, not-to-be disclosed incident: it involves wee, and not in a good way. Crucially, though, the scene, taking on a woman excited by the idea of hashtagging along to #MeToo, delivers a dexterously argued attack not only on liberal smugness \u2013 you might have seen that coming \u2013 but on the evacuation of hard political content, of talk about systems as well as individuals, from so-called political discussion. You don\u2019t often hear this. You might say Birch works a minor revolution, were it not that the term \u201crevolution\u201d is here so ably inspected, dissected \u2013 and judged mostly to be misused. [Blank] marks the 40th anniversary of Clean Break, the theatre company that works with women affected by the criminal justice system. Other scenes are jagged shards. A woman breaks into her mother\u2019s home to find money. In a prison cell, a woman asks for her television to be taken away: she knows how to electrocute herself with it: \u201cit\u2019s a straightforward activity\u201d. An official \u2013 inexperienced and nervous \u2013 visits a woman she has not met before to tell her that her daughter is dead; she has hanged herself. On Rosie Elnile\u2019s pale, boxed design, these scenes \u2013 in which the character\u2019s names are those of the actors \u2013 are not continuous, but they are linked by common difficulties, recurring themes. Together, one of the questions they raise is to what extent the damage caused to these women \u2013 and their children \u2013 is an unbreakable chain of harm: whether what looks predetermined could have been stopped. Irony and paradox are at work, for there is nothing predestined about [Blank]. The scenes so well acted here have been selected by the director, Maria Aberg, from a collection of 100 (the play text runs to over 500 pages): Birch leaves it up to each new director to decide on the number and the order. As if, even with the most difficult of starts, you might have alternatives. Choice \u2013 the chief luxury that comes with money \u2013 is at the core of Lungs, Duncan Macmillan\u2019s 2011 play in which a couple consider the pleasures and perils \u2013 for themselves and the planet \u2013 of having a baby. Like its fiancees \u2013 jittery but monogamous woman; sexually adventurous chap \u2013 it is a suprisingly conservative work from the dramatist who tore the stage apart with People, Places and Things and his adaptation of 1984. But it\u2019s a surefire success: intricately, often dashingly written; sharply directed by Matthew Warchus and vibrantly well acted. Claire Foy and Matt Smith chuck the ermine and epaulettes they wore as that other couple in The Crown, in favour of dungarees (her) and T-shirt (him) in a similar soft grey: they could be best friends who have decided to dress like each other. Each provides a repertoire of distinctive gestures and mannerisms, which stops just short of stereotype. Her hands whir like little windmills; his shoulders shift and roll. She talks nonstop in breathless bursts, interrupting herself to plead: \u201cjust let me talk\u201d. He lounges and (probably) listens. Each skilfully slices, volleys and bounces Macmillan\u2019s lines: \u201cI want to split you apart\u2026\u201d he says a bit sheepishly. She comes back with: \u201cIn the right context, that\u2019s fine.\u201d At their most intense they are often far away from each other, lying back at opposite sides of a stage designed by Rob Howell from solar panels and glinting crystal slabs. The bare space doesn\u2019t change but is said to do so, often to witty effect: ooh, we are in a queue in Ikea; ooh, we are in bed; ooh, we are \u2013 finally, and in rather a tacked-on gabble \u2013 stumbling towards a care home. Since Lungs was first staged, its ecological concerns \u2013 the couple fret about avocados and plastic bags as well as the carbon footprint of a baby \u2013 have become more pressing. Still, they seem to me lightly tethered to the plot rather than truly tugging it. This is an absorbing evening not because of any large environmental claims but because of the needling but generous dialogue that takes you into the heart of a couple. Mike Bartlett \u2013 writer of King Charles III and Doctor Foster \u2013 has adapted Maxim Gorky\u2019s 1910 attack on capitalism in tsarist Russia. Vassa could be the perfect corrective to traditional Chekhov stagings. No one is wiltingly aristocratic; nearly everyone has a mercantile heart; a few characters are seriously scathed, but most are unremittingly scathing. Not least the antiheroine of the title, an unbending matriarch, eager to secure the fortune of her dying husband, possibly by hastening his end: Siobhan Redmond slices the air mercilessly with the edge of her voice and her coolly commanding gestures. Meanwhile, one of her daughters is having it off with her uncle, who has blackmailed her over an abortion; another turns out to have children by an adulterous liaison. There is infanticide and suicide and unremitting suspicion. All relations are skewed and the air is thick with insults. One person is called \u201ca weird monastic crone\u201d; another is jeered at for being fat; one of Vassa\u2019s sons, who has a disability, complains to his mother that people look at him \u201cas if I\u2019m a freak\u201d.

Manchester City won their last home game 5-1; Aston Villa won their last away game by the same scoreline. Something has to give today. And, while the likelihood is that Villa\u2019s defensive dignity will be the first thing to go, they will take plenty of encouragement from Wolves\u2019 smash-and-grab victory at the Etihad earlier this month. </p> <p>Villa sit in 12th after a quietly impressive start to their Premier League return. City have had a slightly odd couple of months. They equalled their worst start to a season since the Abu Dhabi takeover, whith two shocking defeats to Norwich and Wolves, yet they could end the weekend only three points behind Liverpool. </p> <p>They have a few injuries in defence, with Rodri and Oleksandr Zinchenko joining Aymeric Laporte in the rehabilitation wing, so Villa might fancy their chances going forward. The difficult part is at the other end.</p> <p><strong>Kick off is at 12.30pm BST. </strong></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-26T10:21:38.719Z\">at 11.21am BST</time></p>  </div>",

But if I do it may become a legal matter for me, and I\u2019m skint. The Premier League say \u2018the goalscorer is under review\u2019. My instinct is that it touched Silva\u2019s studs, though it\u2019s very hard to be sure. I suspect the goal will be given to De Bruyne to save face. It\u2019s so, so boring. I suspect that goal will be awarded to David Silva, even though a Silva goal would probably have been disallowed for offside. VAR: Clearing Things Up Since 2017. Kevin De Bruyne speaks \u201cDavid said he touched it (for the goal). I have no idea. We had some difficulties in the first half today \u2013 maybe lack of intensity, the rhythm was not there. The second half was a much better performance after Raz\u2019s goal. In the end we deserved to win. We\u2019re just doing our job \u2013 let\u2019s keep it going.\u201d That was a funny old game, though nobody seems to be laughing. After a frustrating first half, Manchester City flexed their muscles in the second half and deserved their win against a game Aston Villa.

Ederson charged from his lunch to make a good save from Davis before McGinn\u2019s follow-up whistled through him and onto the inside of the post. 90+2 min Jesus floats a chip onto the crossbar after a mix-up between Heaton and Mings. It bounced back straight into the hands of Heaton. \u201cLuck of the devil\u201d and all that. 90+1 min Three minutes of added time. 90 min Foden, who had a shot beaten away by Heaton just before the red card, wins a corner after an elegant run down the inside-left channel. 88 min Stones is flattened by a fierce cross from Davis, which hits him just below the neck. He looks pretty groggy. 87 min Manchester City\u2019s tactical fouls are starting to catch up with them. Fernandinho is sent off for a second yellow card, having been adjudged to have pulled back Davis. I\u2019m not sure it was a foul, in truth, but City get away with so many sly fouls that they can\u2019t really complain. 85 min \u201cSurely Sterling was offside both for the De Bruyne cross and the flick from Silva?\u201d says Francis Lee. \u201cHe was right in front of Heaton and obviously interfering with play even if he didn\u2019t touch the ball? Or have the rules changed since I left England 30 years ago?\u201d I think Sterling was onside for the original cross and then offside if it got a touch off David Silva. Hopefully the Premier League will award the goal to Silva after the game, and the entire VAR technology will explode on the grounds that Sterling was offside and a Silva goal does not compute. Then we can return to football being a bit of fun rather than a particularly po-faced episode of Perry Mason. 84 min Anwar El-Ghazi replaces the limping Jack Grealish for Villa. 81 min Gundogan is booked for a tactical foul on Trezeguet. 80 min Grealish, who is on a yellow card, overruns the ball and fouls Joao Cancelo. Some referees would have said \u2018off you pop\u2019 for that; Graham Scott is not one of them. He\u2019s had a very good game. 77 min If Silva got a touch, Sterling was arguably interfering with play when the goal was scored. And I\u2019m not entirely convinced that the ball didn\u2019t brush Sterling\u2019s shorts as well. Does it count as a touch if it hits only the fabric of your shots? I haven\u2019t a clue any more. I do know that the last question was never asked of Gary Lineker. 76 min The reliably brilliant Kevin De Bruyne - who has been given the second goal - is replaced by Phil Foden, and Sergio Aguero comes on for the inspirational Raheem Sterling. 75 min Villa shouldn\u2019t be too disheartened by this, even if it ends 4- or 5-0. They have played very well for large parts of the game. 74 min \u201cAs a (former) librarian I fully support your coinage,\u201d says David C Hunter. \u201cNothing we\u2019d like better than 50,000 attendees who are quiet, studious, and enjoying themselves, though we do prefer to \u2018do it\u2019 indoors.\u201d 73 min A change apiece. Angelino replaces Mendy for City, Keinan Davies replaces Wesley for Villa. It came from a right-wing corner, taken by De Bruyne. Fernandinho touched the ball around the defence at the near post and leathered it across the face of goal. Bernardo Silva couldn\u2019t guide it into an open net, such was the pace on the ball. But Villa could only partially clear it to Gundogan, who waited for the ball to bounce up and lashed a vertical scissor-kick that went through a posse of bodies and into the net. That was a fine bit of improvisation. It\u2019s turning into a rout! GOAL GIVEN! I\u2019ll be honest: I don\u2019t know who scored or whether it was the correct decision to award a goal. I think the answers are \u2018David Silva\u2019 and \u2018yes\u2019. But apparently the goal has been given to De Bruyne. It came from a wicked inswinging cross from De Bruyne, which may have got a touch from Silva on its way into the net. I don\u2019t think Sterling touched it. VAR check There\u2019s a check for offside against Sterling. If he touched the ball he\u2019s offside, and it may have brushed his shorts as he tried to get out of the way. Who knows. That should be the match for City. 62 min Villa are still having plenty of the game. Douglas Luiz\u2019s snappy header, from Guilbert\u2019s cross, is straight at Ederson. 61 min \u201cLibrarial is a real word if you say it is, Rob,\u201d says Alexander Sharkey. \u201cJust depends whether the rest of us adopt your neologism. I think it\u2019s a winner. Same import but easier to say than Emiratial.\u201d 60 min De Bruyne sweeps a left-footed shot well wide from the edge of the area. 58 min McGinn\u2019s high free-kick from the left is fumbled by Ederson, but the ball lands safely for City. In Ederson\u2019s defence, he was baulked by a couple of his own team-mates. 57 min Fernandinho is booked for a foul on Grealish. 55 min: Mings makes a spectacular goalline clearance! Engels\u2019 abysmal ball out of defence went straight to Sterling, who squared it to find Jesus in space in the area. His low shot went through Heaton and bounced up awkwardly on the goalline, where the backpedalling Mings improvised brilliantly to knee it over the bar. 54 min \u201cAs a Liverpool fan I\u2019d like the club sign one creative and established player and it seems that there is a nice pool of upcoming English midfielders,\u201d says Michal. \u201cIf you were the Reds\u2019 director of football, who would target out of Grealish, Sancho and Maddison?\u201d For Liverpool, Maddison I reckon. 53 min A fine run from Mendy, who nutmegs McGinn on the left of the area before hitting a shot that spins just wide off Engels. 50 min De Bruyne\u2019s wicked free-kick from the right flashes right across the face of goal. 49 min \u201cYou just said that 12 teams could conceivably go down,\u201d says Daniel Wighton. \u201cAre you including Man Utd in that gaggle?\u201d Not yet. 47 min Jesus beat Mings in the air to create the goal, which is less than idea from Villa\u2019s perspective. From City\u2019s point of view, it\u2019s yet another goal for the inevitable Raheem Sterling. It was Villa\u2019s kick off as well. The goal came from Ederson\u2019s long ball, which was headed on by Jesus towards Sterling. The last man Engels was wrongfooted by the angle of the header, which allow Sterling to scurry into the area and slide the ball under Heaton. We won\u2019t be seeing Sergio Aguero yet. Raheem Sterling has scored after 20 seconds of the second half! 46 min Peep peep! Aston Villa get the second half under way. No substitutions, although it won\u2019t be long before we see Sergio Aguero if it stays 0-0. \u201cHi Rob,\u201d says James Broughton. \u201cOn that Stones blocked shot, that then touched both hands, but was not given by VAR. The question I have is, how does that fit with the now consistent approach being taken of \u2018all handballs are fouls\u2019? Think back to the City v Spurs game earlier this season and Jesus\u2019 goal was disallowed because VAR concluded the ball had trimmed a City player\u2019s nails before reaching Jesus. It seemed we were getting to a point of any time the ball touched a hand it was a foul. It touched both of Stones\u2019 hands. In short, please clarify.\u201d I had a look at the new law at half-time and I was wrong - VAR man was correct not to give a penalty. Essentially (though there is a degree of ambiguity), it\u2019s not a penalty if the ball deflects off another part of your body onto the arm. Half-time reading Peep peep! A frustrating half for City, who with the exception of Raheem Sterling have been nowhere near their best. Half their players are moaning at the referee, though I\u2019m not sure why. It would be worse for City but for Ederson\u2019s excellent save from John McGinn. See you in 10 minutes for the second half. 45 min Douglas Luiz crosses from the left towards Trezeguet, who loses the sleeping Stones but makes no contact with an attempted stooping header. 43 min David Silva misses City\u2019s best chance of the game. It was made by the superb Sterling, who ran infield, onto Gundogan\u2019s return pass, and eased the ball back towards Silva. He dragged a low, first-time shot just wide of the far post. 43 min Sergio Aguero is having a great game. 42 min Grealish gets away with a foul on David Silva, having lost the ball in a dangerous area. Had the foul been given, that would almost certainly have been a second yellow card. Then again, the first one was harsh. See, it does all even itself out in the end, every now and then. 40 min \u201cVilla fan here,\u201d says David Bertram. \u201cAny chance this side stays up? I feel there\u2019s so much to like about them but the 38-game season will be too short.\u201d Too short?! I think they\u2019ll stay up reasonably comfortably. It\u2019s not easy to call this year, as there are maybe 12 teams that could conceivably go down, but Villa have a lot going for them \u2013 a high-class coaching team, solid defence, arguably England\u2019s best keeper, enough quality in midfield and a home support than will win a few extra points. 38 min Sterling misses a decent chance, flicking a header wide from Gundogan\u2019s stabbed, outside-of-the foot cross. The ball was slightly behind him, which made it a tougher chance than it first looked. 36 min Grealish is booked for fouling Sterling, though it looked like Sterling just slipped. 35 min Villa have three shots blocked in the same attack. The second of those, from Trezeguet, hit Stones\u2019 arm as he fell after originally making a superb block. VAR says ... no penalty. I thought that might be given. 34 min Ederson\u2019s superb long pass puts Sterling through on goal, only for Heaton to charge from the area and calmly chest the ball away. Modern goalkeeping, right there 34 min Yes, I know librarial isn\u2019t actually a word. 33 min The atmosphere at the Etihad is somewhat librarial. Villa will be thrilled with how things are going. 32 min \u201cAs a Baggies fan,\u201d says Alan Davis, \u201cI\u2019m delighted to see that Villa\u2019s change shirts appear to be inscribed WBA.\u201d It\u2019s a reach \u2013 but I\u2019m going to allow it! Oneupmanship given! 30 min David Silva plays the ball straight out of play. City are not, in the parlance of our time, at it. 29 min The Villa fans have a special chant for the day: \u201cChampions of Europe, you\u2019ll never sing that.\u201d 28 min City are not at their slick attacking best. Sterling has looked lively; that\u2019s about it so far. There\u2019s still plenty of time for them to win 5-0, but at the moment it\u2019s a much more even game than most expected. 27 min \u201cYou have to think,\u201d says Phil Grey, \u201cthat Leicester would be three up by now, whichever team they were playing, or possibly even if they were playing Man City and Villa at the same time.\u201d Have I missed something? I watched Monty Don last night. 25 min Stones\u2019 looping header from a corner is palmed over by Heaton. It was probably going onto the roof of the net anyway but he decided to play safe rather than risking a Pickford. 24 min Good game, this. Villa\u2019s posiutive attitude has been really impressive. 23 min: Now Villa are appealing for a penalty! Ederson made a fine diving save from McGinn\u2019s curler, following an abysmal pass from Stones, and then Douglas Luiz went over under challenge from Cancelo as he tried to get to the rebound. I don\u2019t think it was a foul. The ball also hit Douglas Luiz\u2019s hand, so lord knows what it all means. It was a superb save from Ederson in the first place. VAR says... no penalty. 21 min Heaton makes his first save, doing well to hold Joao Cancelo\u2019s long-range shot. The save itself was comfortable; the catch, in these wet conditions, was more impressive. 20 min: NO PENALTY I\u2019m not certain Engels\u2019 arm was in an entirely natural position, but VAR has cleared it. It was never a penalty in old money, as he was just trying to block the shot. 19 min: VAR check City appeal for a penalty when Sterling\u2019s shot hits a Villa defender and spins wide. It did hit Engels on the arm, and this might be given under the absurd new rules. 18 min \u201cThat Villa kit is awful,\u201d says Kevin Ryan. \u201cIt looks like they just grabbed some green training tops and put \u2018em over the black tops. Question: who has the worst change kit in the Premier League?\u201d Sorry, I assumed that was a rhetorical question. 16 min Another good Villa break yields a corner when McGinn\u2019s cross takes a deflection and loops onto the roof of the net. City look more vulnerable to the counter-attack than usual. 15 min Although City have dominated the first 15 minutes, Villa haven\u2019t parked the bus. They are getting forward in numbers when possible, and there\u2019s a smooth confidence to their passing. 13 min A promising counter-attack from Villa ends when Trezeguet is dispossessed by Gundogan on the edge of the area. City counter-counter-attack, and Sterling\u2019s low shot from the edge of the area is blocked by Mings. He didn\u2019t really get hold of it. 10 min Lovely play from Sterling, who twists Guilbert inside out on the left of the area before crossing towards Bernardo Silva at the far post. Targett nips in to clear. 9 min \u201cHi again!\u201d says Ben Woods. \u201cWhen Gerrard and Lampard were 19 they played 29 and 31 Premier League matches for Liverpool and West Ham respectively. Doesn\u2019t Foden need to play similar numbers if he is to reach their levels?\u201d Not necessarily. Paul Scholes didn\u2019t become a regular in the Manchester United midfield until just before his 23rd birthday. Every case is different. But I expected Foden to be starting at least 1 in 4 league games by now. 6 min City are into their work now. After a lovely through pass from Gundogan, Sterling\u2019s low cross towards Jesus is put behind by the sliding Guilbert. 5 min Jesus misses a good chance, shooting just wide on the turn after a ricochet in the box. 4 min It\u2019s been a confident start from Villa, who win the first corner of the match - and make a WTFHWT mess of it. Mendy then charges down the left to win City\u2019s first corner. 1 min Peep peep! City, in blue, kick off from left right. The players have emerged from the tunnel, into the rain. Villa are sporting their new green and black third kit. \u201cIf Phil Foden isn\u2019t going go start this match,\u201d says Ben Woods, \u201cwhen will he be starting?\u201d Last Tuesday? I agree with you, though - I am very surprised how few league games he has started, and he must be starting to wonder whether he needs to do the Sancho. You\u2019d expect him to replace David Silva over the next two years, but he can\u2019t be entirely thrilled with three Premier League starts in two-and-a-bit years. If you\u2019re into the whole rugby thing, you may well want to read about an entirely immense performance from England, who hammered New Zealand 19-7 in Yokohama to reach the World Cup final. Believe it or not, the scoreline flattered the All Blacks. England were mind-blowingly good. It\u2019s a vile day in Manchester, with the rain sheeting down. I can\u2019t decide whether a drenched pitch makes life easier or more difficult for Villa. Pre-match reading Manchester City (4-3-3) Ederson; Cancelo, Stones, Fernandinho, Mendy; De Bruyne, Gundogan, D Silva; B Silva, Gabriel Jesus, Sterling. Substitutes: Bravo, Walker, Aguero, Angelino, Mahrez, Otamendi, Foden. Aston Villa (4-1-4-1) Heaton; Guilbert, Engels, Mings, Targett; Nakamba; Trezeguet, Douglas Luis, McGinn, Grealish; Wesley. Substitutes: Steer, Taylor, Lansbury, Ngoyo, Hourihane, El Ghazi, Davis. Referee Graham Scott. Hello. Manchester City won their last home game 5-1; Aston Villa won their last away game by the same scoreline. Something has to give today. And, while the likelihood is that Villa\u2019s defensive dignity will be the first thing to go, they will take plenty of encouragement from Wolves\u2019 smash-and-grab victory at the Etihad earlier this month. Villa sit in 12th after a quietly impressive start to their Premier League return. City have had a slightly odd couple of months. They equalled their worst start to a season since the Abu Dhabi takeover, whith two shocking defeats to Norwich and Wolves, yet they could end the weekend only three points behind Liverpool. They have a few injuries in defence, with Rodri and Oleksandr Zinchenko joining Aymeric Laporte in the rehabilitation wing, so Villa might fancy their chances going forward. The difficult part is at the other end. Kick off is at 12.30pm BST.",

Ederson saved a McGinn effort to his left, the ball spilled to Douglas Luiz and as Fernandinho and Jo\u00e3o Cancelo closed on the midfielder he went down but City escaped. When David Silva and Ilkay G\u00fcndogan\u2019s radars are off City can struggle, though Ederson\u2019s ability to fire 60-yard passes \u2013 such as the one Heaton raced out to chest away \u2013 illustrates their all-round potency. Guardiola has been concerned at the chances conceded by his team, with Tr\u00e9z\u00e9guet and Wesley given room to shoot in the penalty area. As half-time approached the lack of ruthlessness in the opposite box was also illustrated when Sterling teed up David Silva but he sprayed wide. Twenty-three seconds into the second half and Sterling showed Silva how. A high ball was knocked into his path and, after advancing on Heaton\u2019s goal, he fired his finish through the goalkeeper\u2019s legs. This was Sterling\u2019s 13th strike of the term for City and his seventh in the league, two behind the top scorer, Jamie Vardy. When City score once they often do so a second time or more. Not long after the opener, Benjamin Mendy\u2019s shot could have doubled the margin, then Jesus missed a second sitter of the contest, unable to finish from a few yards out. This had Guardiola stamping in fury. It also left Villa in the contest and when Douglas Luiz rose and headed straight at Ederson City were left relieved. Soon they had a second goal. De Bruyne swapped passes with Mendy from corner on the left. The Belgian swung the ball in, and it passed David Silva and Sterling and went in. Cue a VAR delay to see if Sterling was offside before the goal was ruled to be good and credited to De Bruyne. Dean Smith was in no doubt. \u201cThe second goal I believe is offside,\u201d he said, before pointing to the Belgian being awarded it, believing Silva to have touched the ball. \u201cThat\u2019s a get-out for the officials.\u201d City were soon 3-0 up: following a melee at a corner G\u00fcndogan volleyed sweetly home. There was more bad news for Smith when Grealish was seen on crutches. He may miss Wednesday\u2019s Carabao Cup tie with Wolves.",

      "body": "<p>It can take a generation to put right a wrong. For the American artist Jann Haworth it has taken half a century to correct a particularly high-profile piece of historical bias.</p> <p>In 1967, Haworth and her then husband Peter Blake made one of the most famous commercial artworks of the modern age: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/nov/29/sir-peter-blake-this-much-i-know\" title=\"\">the cover of the Beatles album</a> <em>Sgt Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band</em>. Among the <a href=\"https://www.integral-domain.org/rgriffiths/sgtpepper/images/pepper_people.jpg\" title=\"\">65 different people</a> it featured, from Albert Einstein, Fred Astaire and HG Wells to the occultist Aleister Crowley, there were only 12 women and, as Haworth admits, three of those were different images of child star Shirley Temple.</p> <p>What is more, Haworth, a young female artist at the time, found her own key role in creating the cover was ignored for years.</p> <p>Now Haworth and her daughter, Liberty Blake, are bringing to Britain a work they started together in 2016 to set straight the record of women\u2019s achievements. Their <em><a href=\"https://pallant.org.uk/whats-on/jann-haworth-close-up/\" title=\"\">Work in Progress</a></em><a href=\"https://pallant.org.uk/whats-on/jann-haworth-close-up/\" title=\"\"> mural</a> \u2013 seven panels, 28ft long and 8ft wide \u2013 displays the faces of more than 100 influential women who have either been written out of history or marginalised.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d8edfcfac724481f46c5edf7e123c3e300dc78c5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d8edfcfac724481f46c5edf7e123c3e300dc78c5/0_0_12916_3705/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Work in Progress by Jann Haworth and Liberty Blake.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"287\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Work in Progress by Jann Haworth and Liberty Blake.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Johnstone/Courtesy of the artist</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe have notable women there, like Twiggy, the judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the aviator Amelia Earhart, notorious spy Mata Hari, and Rosalind Franklin, the scientist whose crystallography enabled the discovery of DNA,\u201d said Haworth, 77.</p> <p>\u201cReally the point of this project is that you will recognise some of the faces, but not others. The feeling of knowing and yet not knowing these women\u2019s full stories is part of the meaning. It makes it distinct and it almost makes you shiver.\u201d</p> <p>The artist, who collaborated in workshops with volunteers from Salt Lake City, near her home in Utah, to make the artwork, believes it is important this project remains unfinished, a work in progress, because it would impossible to correct centuries of conventional history that have left women out.</p> <p>\u201cIt is also significant that other people contribute, because I know very little about, say, astrophysics and women in other fields. And women\u2019s real value in the world is not just about their place in history books. So the workshop process is almost more important than the outcome,\u201d she said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d626bfe182b257f8720276aa4777406df081dc31\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d626bfe182b257f8720276aa4777406df081dc31/0_0_2442_2263/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Beatles\u2019 Sgt Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band album cover.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"927\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Beatles\u2019 Sgt Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band album cover.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2009, Haworth brought another attention-grabbing feminist work over to Britain: her <a href=\"http://www.modernwestfineart.com/jann-haworth/\" title=\"\">Mannequin Defectors</a> series, which showed corset-wearing shop clothes dummies rebelling by carrying protest placards. It has always upset her that most of the female images on <em>Sgt Pepper</em> were decorative figures.</p> <p>\u201cWe asked the Beatles to give us names of their heroes and none of them came up with women,\u201d she said. \u201cI take some responsibility though for the fact that Peter and I only used a few.\u201d In her view the \u201conly good one\u201d they included was the sassy film star Mae West.</p> <p>The Blakes had known the Beatles for four years when they were asked to design the front of their eighth studio album, the psychedelically-inspired LP that went on to spend 27 weeks at the top of the British charts and features songs such as Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds, With a Little Help from my Friends, and When I\u2019m Sixty-Four.</p> <p>Paul McCartney has claimed he had the original idea for the image and John Lennon later sketched a final version, but Blake and Haworth created it together, choosing the characters and ruling out suggestions, including Lennon\u2019s that Adolf Hitler should appear.</p> <p>Neither Blake nor Haworth heard the tracks on the album until after they watched the cover photographed by Michael Cooper in his studio.

      "bodyText": "It can take a generation to put right a wrong. For the American artist Jann Haworth it has taken half a century to correct a particularly high-profile piece of historical bias. In 1967, Haworth and her then husband Peter Blake made one of the most famous commercial artworks of the modern age: the cover of the Beatles album Sgt Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band. Among the 65 different people it featured, from Albert Einstein, Fred Astaire and HG Wells to the occultist Aleister Crowley, there were only 12 women and, as Haworth admits, three of those were different images of child star Shirley Temple. What is more, Haworth, a young female artist at the time, found her own key role in creating the cover was ignored for years. Now Haworth and her daughter, Liberty Blake, are bringing to Britain a work they started together in 2016 to set straight the record of women\u2019s achievements. Their Work in Progress mural \u2013 seven panels, 28ft long and 8ft wide \u2013 displays the faces of more than 100 influential women who have either been written out of history or marginalised. \u201cWe have notable women there, like Twiggy, the judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the aviator Amelia Earhart, notorious spy Mata Hari, and Rosalind Franklin, the scientist whose crystallography enabled the discovery of DNA,\u201d said Haworth, 77. \u201cReally the point of this project is that you will recognise some of the faces, but not others. The feeling of knowing and yet not knowing these women\u2019s full stories is part of the meaning. It makes it distinct and it almost makes you shiver.\u201d The artist, who collaborated in workshops with volunteers from Salt Lake City, near her home in Utah, to make the artwork, believes it is important this project remains unfinished, a work in progress, because it would impossible to correct centuries of conventional history that have left women out. \u201cIt is also significant that other people contribute, because I know very little about, say, astrophysics and women in other fields. And women\u2019s real value in the world is not just about their place in history books. So the workshop process is almost more important than the outcome,\u201d she said. In 2009, Haworth brought another attention-grabbing feminist work over to Britain: her Mannequin Defectors series, which showed corset-wearing shop clothes dummies rebelling by carrying protest placards. It has always upset her that most of the female images on Sgt Pepper were decorative figures. \u201cWe asked the Beatles to give us names of their heroes and none of them came up with women,\u201d she said. \u201cI take some responsibility though for the fact that Peter and I only used a few.\u201d In her view the \u201conly good one\u201d they included was the sassy film star Mae West. The Blakes had known the Beatles for four years when they were asked to design the front of their eighth studio album, the psychedelically-inspired LP that went on to spend 27 weeks at the top of the British charts and features songs such as Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds, With a Little Help from my Friends, and When I\u2019m Sixty-Four. Paul McCartney has claimed he had the original idea for the image and John Lennon later sketched a final version, but Blake and Haworth created it together, choosing the characters and ruling out suggestions, including Lennon\u2019s that Adolf Hitler should appear. Neither Blake nor Haworth heard the tracks on the album until after they watched the cover photographed by Michael Cooper in his studio. Haworth constructed the figures on the cover like a stage set with full-size models she made, as well as waxworks borrowed from Madame Tussauds. The couple were paid only \u00a3200. \u201cWe were all young and foolish at the time,\u201d Haworth recalled. \u201cPeter would have done it as a small-scale collage but I wanted the front row to be three-dimensional.\u201d After a painful divorce in 1984, Haworth returned to America. She now feels that the mural of women she has made with their 51-year-old daughter, which goes on show at Pallant House in Chichester from 2 November, is a powerful way of bridging that family \u201crift\u201d: \u201cLibby, like her father, is a detailed collagist and she is very much part of this project. So in some way this is a synthesis and a healing,\u201d Haworth said. There was a discussion about whether to include Princess Diana in the mural, someone only famous by marriage, and Haworth also admits to over-ruling the face of Margaret Thatcher. \u201cIt is my artwork after all,\u201d she said.",

      "body": "<p>Police and volunteers in Cambodia are searching for a missing British woman last seen by friends in the early hours of Thursday at a beach party on the island of Koh Rong.</p> <p>Amelia Bambridge, 21, from Worthing in Sussex, went to a party on Wednesday at <a href=\"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1808558-d10308115-Reviews-Police_Beach_Party_Zone-Koh_Rong_Koh_Kong_Province.html\">Police Beach</a>, which is popular with backpackers and located off the south-west coast of the South-East Asian country. Her handbag, containing her phone and bank cards, was found on the beach on Thursday but she has not been seen since the event.</p> <p>Concern was raised on Thursday when Bambridge was not seen at the <a href=\"https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Hotel_Review-g1808558-d11627371-Reviews-Nest_Beach_Club-Koh_Rong_Koh_Kong_Province.html\">Nest Beach Club</a> hostel on Koh Rong, where she had stayed and left her passport. She also failed to meet a friend for a scheduled ferry trip.</p> <p>On Saturday morning police teams and volunteers searched the island and the surrounding ocean for signs of her. Bambridge\u2019s parents have spoken to British embassy staff and on Saturday were travelling to Cambodia.</p> <p>Amelia\u2019s sister, Georgie Bambridge, 19, told the Guardian that she spoke to her sibling from the UK shortly before Amelia went to the party. Georgie said that after her backpacking trip Amelia, a former student of Brighton Hove and Sussex sixth form college, planned to train as an English language teacher in Vietnam, where her father works.</p> <p>\u201cShe was telling me about travelling [and about how] she felt more confident and so much more happy,\u201d Georgie said. \u201cShe was excited about going to this party. She\u2019s officially missing now. The police started involvement in the search party this [Saturday] morning. They\u2019re searching, and they\u2019re searching the sea.\u201d</p> <p>Koh Rong\u2019s regular Police Beach parties have a reputation for extreme hedonism.

He went to a Police Beach party on the night he arrived on the island.</p> <p>Ryan did not return to Police Beach for the party Bambridge attended on Wednesday, just before she went missing. He said he was in contact with a female friend of Bambridge\u2019s who had been at the event with her.</p> <p>\u201cShe [the friend] said that the last time she saw Amelia she wasn\u2019t on anything,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was sober, she\u2019d had a few drinks. The last time she saw her she was fine.\u201d</p> <p>In 2013 a 55-year-old US tourist named Katherine Grgich was <a href=\"https://english.cambodiadaily.com/features/left-for-dead-77524/\">killed on Koh Rong</a> in what police said was an aggravated robbery that escalated to murder. A local man was identified as a suspect but no one has been brought to trial for the death.</p> <p>Hannah Clark, 21, a friend of Bambridge\u2019s, was helping to raise awareness of her disappearance on social media from the UK. She described Bambridge as her \u201cmost reliable friend\u201d, adding that she would be hugely unlikely to break off contact from loved ones voluntarily.</p> <p>Ryan said of Bambridge: \u201cShe\u2019s lovely, a really nice girl. She\u2019s just a normal, outgoing person. She\u2019ll happily chat to anyone. I cut her hair in Phnom Penh \u2013 there were three girls there who\u2019d just moved into our hostel, and she was chatting away for the whole hour.</p> <p>\u201cThe last time I saw her I said: \u2018I\u2019ll see you in Siem Reap.\u2019\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Police and volunteers in Cambodia are searching for a missing British woman last seen by friends in the early hours of Thursday at a beach party on the island of Koh Rong. Amelia Bambridge, 21, from Worthing in Sussex, went to a party on Wednesday at Police Beach, which is popular with backpackers and located off the south-west coast of the South-East Asian country. Her handbag, containing her phone and bank cards, was found on the beach on Thursday but she has not been seen since the event. Concern was raised on Thursday when Bambridge was not seen at the Nest Beach Club hostel on Koh Rong, where she had stayed and left her passport. She also failed to meet a friend for a scheduled ferry trip. On Saturday morning police teams and volunteers searched the island and the surrounding ocean for signs of her. Bambridge\u2019s parents have spoken to British embassy staff and on Saturday were travelling to Cambodia. Amelia\u2019s sister, Georgie Bambridge, 19, told the Guardian that she spoke to her sibling from the UK shortly before Amelia went to the party. Georgie said that after her backpacking trip Amelia, a former student of Brighton Hove and Sussex sixth form college, planned to train as an English language teacher in Vietnam, where her father works. \u201cShe was telling me about travelling [and about how] she felt more confident and so much more happy,\u201d Georgie said. \u201cShe was excited about going to this party. She\u2019s officially missing now. The police started involvement in the search party this [Saturday] morning. They\u2019re searching, and they\u2019re searching the sea.\u201d Koh Rong\u2019s regular Police Beach parties have a reputation for extreme hedonism. One online reviewer wrote that they were known for \u201cfree drug usage with no police, no restrictions\u201d. Another review stated: \u201cSome questionable things always seem to happen at the parties, so visitors should stay aware when they are there just in case.\u201d Ryan Harris, 18, from Worcester, befriended Bambridge in Phnom Penh then travelled with her and other friends to Koh Rong on 19 October. He went to a Police Beach party on the night he arrived on the island. Ryan did not return to Police Beach for the party Bambridge attended on Wednesday, just before she went missing. He said he was in contact with a female friend of Bambridge\u2019s who had been at the event with her. \u201cShe [the friend] said that the last time she saw Amelia she wasn\u2019t on anything,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was sober, she\u2019d had a few drinks. The last time she saw her she was fine.\u201d In 2013 a 55-year-old US tourist named Katherine Grgich was killed on Koh Rong in what police said was an aggravated robbery that escalated to murder. A local man was identified as a suspect but no one has been brought to trial for the death. Hannah Clark, 21, a friend of Bambridge\u2019s, was helping to raise awareness of her disappearance on social media from the UK. She described Bambridge as her \u201cmost reliable friend\u201d, adding that she would be hugely unlikely to break off contact from loved ones voluntarily. Ryan said of Bambridge: \u201cShe\u2019s lovely, a really nice girl. She\u2019s just a normal, outgoing person. She\u2019ll happily chat to anyone. I cut her hair in Phnom Penh \u2013 there were three girls there who\u2019d just moved into our hostel, and she was chatting away for the whole hour. \u201cThe last time I saw her I said: \u2018I\u2019ll see you in Siem Reap.\u2019\u201d",

All the kids who lived around me didn\u2019t go to the same school, so I spent a lot of time alone. Television was my friend, and not in a sad way. I loved TV. I preferred TV to people. As a result, I\u2019m quite self-reliant. Even now, my perfect week involves lots of TV.</p> <p><strong>Because of my</strong> father\u2019s job, we lived in 13 houses in 17 years. That means you have to be quite flexible in terms of fitting in when you go to a new school. You find ways not to be the kid who\u2019s bullied, so I guess what I found was a weird combination of either being funny or blending into the background.</p> <p><strong>My parents were</strong> both funny. My mother has a sharp wit and, like me, can jump in with a quick judgment. My father could tell a good story, an Irish yarn. My sense of humour is closer to my mother\u2019s.</p> <p><strong>Being gay, </strong>I had to leave Ireland to find myself. I couldn\u2019t wait to get out. Some people didn\u2019t leave. The ones who stayed and fought and chipped away with placards and petitions \u2013 they\u2019re the heroes.</p> <p><strong>The most formative</strong> thing that ever happened to me was getting stabbed in 1989. It gave me real perspective on life and what mattered. Before that I was at drama school, caught up in the search for success. I went back to drama school and people were slamming doors because of the roles they got and I was like: \u201cUh, I nearly died. I\u2019m just really happy to be alive.\u201d Now if I get worried about something, I can put it into perspective.</p> <p><strong>My dogs, Bailey and Madge, </strong>bring me great joy and great sorrow. They\u2019re a daily lesson in mindfulness because they live in the present. All they think is, \u201cAm I thirsty? Am I horny? Am I tired?\u201d But they\u2019re about to bring deep sadness because they\u2019re ancient. Bailey is 15 and I\u2019ve discovered this year that Madge is actually older than him. It will be terrible when they go.</p> <p><strong>I love going home</strong> to Ireland now. I have a house in County Cork. When you\u2019re a kid you want everything to be fast and shiny, but slow and dull has its own richness and that\u2019s what Ireland kind of has, as well as community.</p> <p><strong>I always get excited</strong> about returning to the chat show. Each time there\u2019s a slight sense of, \u201cOoh, can I still do this?\u201d But then you see the people on the sofa and the 600 people in the audience all geed up and you think, \u201cActually, I don\u2019t suck at this job. There\u2019s a reason I\u2019ve been doing it so long.\u201d It\u2019s good to remind yourself of that occasionally.</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006xnzc\">The Graham Norton Show</a> is on BBC One at 10.35pm on Fridays</em></p>",

My mother has a sharp wit and, like me, can jump in with a quick judgment. My father could tell a good story, an Irish yarn. My sense of humour is closer to my mother\u2019s. Being gay, I had to leave Ireland to find myself. I couldn\u2019t wait to get out. Some people didn\u2019t leave. The ones who stayed and fought and chipped away with placards and petitions \u2013 they\u2019re the heroes. The most formative thing that ever happened to me was getting stabbed in 1989. It gave me real perspective on life and what mattered. Before that I was at drama school, caught up in the search for success. I went back to drama school and people were slamming doors because of the roles they got and I was like: \u201cUh, I nearly died. I\u2019m just really happy to be alive.\u201d Now if I get worried about something, I can put it into perspective. My dogs, Bailey and Madge, bring me great joy and great sorrow. They\u2019re a daily lesson in mindfulness because they live in the present. All they think is, \u201cAm I thirsty? Am I horny? Am I tired?\u201d But they\u2019re about to bring deep sadness because they\u2019re ancient. Bailey is 15 and I\u2019ve discovered this year that Madge is actually older than him. It will be terrible when they go. I love going home to Ireland now. I have a house in County Cork. When you\u2019re a kid you want everything to be fast and shiny, but slow and dull has its own richness and that\u2019s what Ireland kind of has, as well as community. I always get excited about returning to the chat show. Each time there\u2019s a slight sense of, \u201cOoh, can I still do this?\u201d But then you see the people on the sofa and the 600 people in the audience all geed up and you think, \u201cActually, I don\u2019t suck at this job. There\u2019s a reason I\u2019ve been doing it so long.\u201d It\u2019s good to remind yourself of that occasionally. The Graham Norton Show is on BBC One at 10.35pm on Fridays",

The discs were probably worn on a special garment as ornaments. The mirror was probably made specially for its owner.</p> <p>Experts said the graves of both women indicated that they played powerful roles in their communities, contradicting traditional stereotypes about prehistoric culture.</p> <p>For Rosen, this is a chance to unlock the meaning that was attributed to these objects when their owners touched them for the last time. \u201cThere is no such thing as a human being who is not intertwined with the objects of their lives,\u201d he says. \u201cWe express ourselves in the objects that we make, acquire, buy or inherit. It\u2019s not possible to conceive of the idea of consciousness separate from the objects through which we express ourselves.\u201d</p> <p>He believes poetry can help to interpret the emotions contained and conveyed in ancient burial objects that have lost their symbolic power. \u201cYou can place an object in a museum and ask people to stare at it. But for many of us, like myself, we need some kind of mediation, some way of understanding the object that is more than we can get off the surface of it.\u201d</p> <p>The moment people begin to speculate about the purpose of an object, he says, they enter the realm of imagination and interpretation. \u201cPoetry combines feelings with ideas in quite an intuitive sort of a way. It is one of the ways people\u2019s curiosity can be aroused.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bd39429940c21b4548882d2606b8575d0f9d806e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bd39429940c21b4548882d2606b8575d0f9d806e/0_146_4368_2621/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Rosen\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Rosen says poetry can help people connect with the objects and their makers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Godwin/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rosen hopes his poetry will enable people to understand the connections that existed between the objects and their makers. \u201cI am fascinated by what these objects say about people and what people were saying about the objects.\u201d</p> <p>It is a conversation that he thinks was always meant to be had beyond the grave. \u201cSomeone has crafted these objects with all sorts of intentions and these aren\u2019t closed. They are not the end of a conversation.

      "bodyText": "Three are chalk cylinders, buried with a six-year-old child. Four are shiny gold discs and one is an ancient bronze mirror. For thousands of years, they lay in the cold dark earth, their names forgotten, their meaning lost, waiting to be found. Now, for the first time, they are being held up to the light, with three new poems by Michael Rosen that celebrate the spectacular prehistoric objects buried in Britain\u2019s early graves. The poems, which Rosen will read aloud on Halloween at the British Museum, were commissioned by the museum and the universities of Reading and Manchester as part of a project to understand the significance of ancient British burial objects and why their owners would have wanted them in their graves. Researchers asked Rosen to write about three specially selected items: the Folkton drums, buried with a small child in North Yorkshire around 5,000 years ago; the Knowes of Trotty discs that were buried with a woman on Orkney in 2,000 BC; and the intricately decorated Portesham mirror, buried with an old woman in Dorset around AD 40-50. Archaeologists speculate that the drums may have been part of a measuring device \u2013 and perhaps charted a child\u2019s growth. The discs were probably worn on a special garment as ornaments. The mirror was probably made specially for its owner. Experts said the graves of both women indicated that they played powerful roles in their communities, contradicting traditional stereotypes about prehistoric culture. For Rosen, this is a chance to unlock the meaning that was attributed to these objects when their owners touched them for the last time. \u201cThere is no such thing as a human being who is not intertwined with the objects of their lives,\u201d he says. \u201cWe express ourselves in the objects that we make, acquire, buy or inherit. It\u2019s not possible to conceive of the idea of consciousness separate from the objects through which we express ourselves.\u201d He believes poetry can help to interpret the emotions contained and conveyed in ancient burial objects that have lost their symbolic power. \u201cYou can place an object in a museum and ask people to stare at it. But for many of us, like myself, we need some kind of mediation, some way of understanding the object that is more than we can get off the surface of it.\u201d The moment people begin to speculate about the purpose of an object, he says, they enter the realm of imagination and interpretation. \u201cPoetry combines feelings with ideas in quite an intuitive sort of a way. It is one of the ways people\u2019s curiosity can be aroused.\u201d Rosen hopes his poetry will enable people to understand the connections that existed between the objects and their makers. \u201cI am fascinated by what these objects say about people and what people were saying about the objects.\u201d It is a conversation that he thinks was always meant to be had beyond the grave. \u201cSomeone has crafted these objects with all sorts of intentions and these aren\u2019t closed. They are not the end of a conversation. People are using these objects for purposes beyond themselves. \u201cAnd by making them durable, they must have had some sense that these objects could last, and therefore that different people would find them and look at them, whether that was in the afterworld \u2013 or another place.\u201d Neil Wilkin, curator of early Europe at the British Museum, believes the poems will be a useful resource for teachers, now that the government has added Britain\u2019s ancient history to the national curriculum. \u201cTeachers have been given this task of teaching about prehistory,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s really quite unfair, because teachers don\u2019t have a lot of background knowledge about this period.\u201d It is particularly challenging because there are so few texts from the period that people can engage with, he says. \u201cWe don\u2019t have written text.

What he lacks in coherent strategy, he makes up for in shock and awe. Trump will send in the tanks and take no prisoners.</p> <p>It appears that most Republicans are still willing to march behind him, not by defending what many see as indefensible \u2013 the president\u2019s offer of a quid pro quo to Ukraine \u2013 but by throwing <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/24/us/politics/trump-republicans-impeachment.html\">sand into the gears of the impeachment process.</a> With the help of Fox News, they are set to intensify attacks on the legitimacy of the inquiry itself, demonising its leaders and sowing doubt wherever possible.</p> <p>The great unknown is whether the approach will prove as effective as their efforts to undermine the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/25/mueller-report-trump-justice-department-democrats-grand-jury-evidence\">special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation</a>, potentially boosting Trump in the 2020 election, or the case against him will be so compelling that he will be removed from office or defeated at the polls.</p> <p>\u201cTrump is using the same approach he did to subvert the Mueller report: undermining the legitimacy of the messenger, assigning political motives to those who testify and relying on the Fox News firewall to serve up propaganda to his base,\u201d said <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kurtbardella?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Kurt Bardella,</a> a former spokesperson and senior adviser for Republicans on the House oversight committee.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>No matter who\u2019s working in the White House, we already know it will be blown to hell by Trump\u2019s tweets on any given day</p> <footer> <cite>Kurt Bardella</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe difference is that with Mueller we had a lot of time where we didn\u2019t know anything.

The testimony of a Pentagon official was postponed by more than five hours. The members complained about lack of transparency as evidence is being given behind closed doors.</p> <p>It was not their only gambit. Earlier in the week Republicans attempted to censure Adam Schiff, the chair of the House intelligence committee, for his handling of the impeachment inquiry, only for the Democratic majority to set the resolution aside. On Thursday Lindsey Graham, the chair of the Senate judiciary committee and a Trump loyalist, introduced a resolution condemning the inquiry as an unfair, secretive and designed to embarrass the president.</p> <p>In an ominous development, the justice department stepped up its review of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/24/justice-department-opens-criminal-inquiry-into-origins-of-russia-investigation-source\">origins of Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation,</a> giving prosecutors the ability to issue subpoenas, potentially form a grand jury and compel witnesses to give testimony and bring federal criminal charges. The move raised fears of a politically motivated ploy to burnish the overall narrative that Trump is a victim of the deep state, casting impeachment as Mueller 2.0.</p> <p>But there was still little sign of a war bunker where a strategy is being coordinated. Instead it appears to be a case of a scattergun and \u201cfire at will\u201d, a measure of how ill-equipped the White House is for the battle to come. More than 1,000 days into Trump\u2019s presidency, its ranks are severely depleted.</p> <p>The chief strategist Steve Bannon is long gone.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump has shown little taste for military adventure. He avoided the draft in Vietnam. He fell out with his once-beloved generals. He stunned the world by pulling troops out of Syria and abandoning America\u2019s Kurdish allies. But on the political battlefield, the president has shown how he and his allies intend to fight impeachment: with a blitzkrieg aimed at deflecting, distracting and discrediting. What he lacks in coherent strategy, he makes up for in shock and awe. Trump will send in the tanks and take no prisoners. It appears that most Republicans are still willing to march behind him, not by defending what many see as indefensible \u2013 the president\u2019s offer of a quid pro quo to Ukraine \u2013 but by throwing sand into the gears of the impeachment process. With the help of Fox News, they are set to intensify attacks on the legitimacy of the inquiry itself, demonising its leaders and sowing doubt wherever possible. The great unknown is whether the approach will prove as effective as their efforts to undermine the special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation, potentially boosting Trump in the 2020 election, or the case against him will be so compelling that he will be removed from office or defeated at the polls. \u201cTrump is using the same approach he did to subvert the Mueller report: undermining the legitimacy of the messenger, assigning political motives to those who testify and relying on the Fox News firewall to serve up propaganda to his base,\u201d said Kurt Bardella, a former spokesperson and senior adviser for Republicans on the House oversight committee. \u201cThe difference is that with Mueller we had a lot of time where we didn\u2019t know anything. In the impeachment inquiry we are getting a steady stream of new information that is providing context.\u201d House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry is a month old. Unlike Mueller it has moved at warp speed, subpoenaing witnesses, gathering testimony and building evidence against the president some say makes it inevitable he will be impeached by the House and put on trial by the Republican-controlled Senate. This week Bill Taylor, the top US diplomat in Ukraine, made the most damning allegations yet about a quid pro quo in which Trump threatened to suspend military aid and the offer of a White House meeting unless Ukraine agreed to announce investigations into political rivals including the former vice-president Joe Biden, a potential opponent in next year\u2019s presidential election. Taylor, a respected Vietnam war veteran with half a century of public service, also described an \u201cirregular, informal policy channel\u201d by which the Trump administration was pursuing objectives in Ukraine \u201crunning contrary to the goals of longstanding US policy\u201d. His evidence reportedly prompted \u201ca lot of sighs and gasps\u201d in the hearing room. The backlash from Trump was as swift as it was expected. Since the shadow of impeachment fell, the president has put down a daily barrage of tweets. Responding to Taylor and other members of his own party he sees as disloyal, he described \u201cNever Trumper Republicans\u201d as \u201chuman scum\u201d. On the same day, about 30 House Republicans barged into the secure facility where the impeachment depositions are being taken and ordered pizza. The testimony of a Pentagon official was postponed by more than five hours. The members complained about lack of transparency as evidence is being given behind closed doors. It was not their only gambit. Earlier in the week Republicans attempted to censure Adam Schiff, the chair of the House intelligence committee, for his handling of the impeachment inquiry, only for the Democratic majority to set the resolution aside. On Thursday Lindsey Graham, the chair of the Senate judiciary committee and a Trump loyalist, introduced a resolution condemning the inquiry as an unfair, secretive and designed to embarrass the president. In an ominous development, the justice department stepped up its review of the origins of Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation, giving prosecutors the ability to issue subpoenas, potentially form a grand jury and compel witnesses to give testimony and bring federal criminal charges. The move raised fears of a politically motivated ploy to burnish the overall narrative that Trump is a victim of the deep state, casting impeachment as Mueller 2.0. But there was still little sign of a war bunker where a strategy is being coordinated. Instead it appears to be a case of a scattergun and \u201cfire at will\u201d, a measure of how ill-equipped the White House is for the battle to come. More than 1,000 days into Trump\u2019s presidency, its ranks are severely depleted. The chief strategist Steve Bannon is long gone. Stephanie Grisham, the press secretary, has never given a formal briefing to reporters in the west wing. Trump does not have a permanent chief of staff, only Mick Mulvaney in an acting capacity. Earlier this month Mulvaney held a disastrous briefing in which he blurted out a confession of a quid pro quo with Ukraine, only to issue a retraction later. It means there are fewer guardrails on a president who would be capricious, impulsive and mendacious even if surrounded by the best and the brightest. Bardella added: \u201cNo matter who\u2019s working in the White House, we already know it will be blown to hell by Trump\u2019s tweets on any given day. You can have the best organisation in the world but it\u2019s useless if the principal is so undisciplined.\u201d \u2018Clinton had a pretty good approach\u2019 The lack of structure could not be more different from the last president to be impeached, Bill Clinton, who set up a dedicated \u201cwar room\u201d while getting on with the business of governing. Graham, now working with the White House on a better coordinated strategy but then an impeachment manager in the House, told reporters this week the Clinton example should be followed because he \u201chad a team that was organised, that had legal minds that could understand what was being said versus the legal proceedings in question, and they were on message every day\u201d. The senator from South Carolina added: \u201cPresident Clinton defended himself but he never stopped being president.

      "body": "<p>Here\u2019s one of the most audacious, esoteric British stars of our times, shuffling into an anonymous industrial unit between Heaton and Byker in Newcastle (the city\u2019s Blank Studios, where he records, are housed here). His look brings to mind a wayward Father Christmas off-season: a tweed-patched baseball cap over silvery hair and a beard, a plaid shirt over a T-shirt celebrating Finnish metal band the Circle. From his right hand swings a bunch of six bananas. \u201cWould you like one?\u201d Richard Dawson gestures, shyly. </p> <p>We\u2019re here because of Dawson\u2019s one-of-a-kind, state-of-the-nation new opus, which is called, very simply, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/oct/11/richard-dawson-2020-review-domino-album-britain\" title=\"\"><em>2020</em></a>, and has been hailed by more than one reviewer as a masterpiece. It\u2019s a record about the bleak lives of civil servants, convulsing fulfilment centre workers, and homeless people sleeping in alleyways next to happy families coming out of Nando\u2019s. It\u2019s a very different proposition to his last LP, 2017\u2019s <em>Peasant</em>, a research-heavy odyssey set between AD400 and 600, mixing together the rawer moments of folk, punk\u2019s attack and squiggling psychedelia. It nevertheless made many end-of-year lists, partly because Dawson has a way with a tune despite his avant garde leanings, but also because of his incredible voice. At times, it\u2019s the plangent roar of an ancient summoner. At others, it\u2019s a sad, high quiver, as if Neil Young had gone northern. (When I first saw Dawson sing a cappella at the 2017 Green Man festival, the power of the experience floored me: I was rooted to the spot, agog and in tears.)</p> <p><em>2020</em> adds BBC 6 Music-friendly poppy choruses and riffs to Dawson\u2019s musical palette (bar one track, he plays every instrument on the album). Its first singles, Jogging and Two Halves, are particularly earwormy, but listen more closely. Jogging is about a man recently made redundant, getting paranoid about \u201cpeople getting nastier\u201d in lonely middle England. Two Halves describes a boy playing football and being hectored from the touchline, leaping between comedy (\u201cstop fannying around\u201d) and tortured sadness (\u201cat the final whistle I am inconsolable\u201d).</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGiQ_-Ktpvc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UGiQ_-Ktpvc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://youtu.be/UGiQ_-Ktpvc\">Watch the video for Jogging by Richard Dawson</a>.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>\u201cI wanted to make these almost anthemic choruses, so it sounds like pop or what have you,\u201d Dawson begins, arranging two chairs in the corner of the studio, his bananas now sitting next to him on an amp. \u201cSome sort of slightly skewed version of what might be coming out of someone\u2019s radio, for the songs to seem quite glorious, but once you start digesting them a bit, they get stuck in your throat. Maybe like a slight queasiness.\u201d He describes his approach, and indeed lots of things today, in sweetly wonky terms. \u201cThe sound\u2019s a bit more, \u2018I\u2019ve seen that outfit before\u2019, but the clothes are a bit too small for the people in the songs. Or too baggy. Like these more standard kinds of modes would not fit the characters well. So we click into something else, something deeper, as we listen.\u201d</p> <p>Born in 1981, Dawson was the youngest of three children in an upwardly mobile Newcastle family. (\u201cWe moved into a house with dado rails when I was little,\u201d he says, by way of explanation. \u201cOoh! We\u2019ve made it!\u201d) His mother was an A&amp;E paediatric nurse who became a child protection officer, his father a packaging worker who was twice made redundant, then became a running coach.

Settling down with pints of Guinness, we get talking about Dawson\u2019s degenerative eye condition, juvenile retinoschisis, which began in his childhood; it generally stabilises in young adulthood, before getting worse in middle age. Dawson\u2019s older brother has it too and is now registered blind.

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s one of the most audacious, esoteric British stars of our times, shuffling into an anonymous industrial unit between Heaton and Byker in Newcastle (the city\u2019s Blank Studios, where he records, are housed here). His look brings to mind a wayward Father Christmas off-season: a tweed-patched baseball cap over silvery hair and a beard, a plaid shirt over a T-shirt celebrating Finnish metal band the Circle. From his right hand swings a bunch of six bananas. \u201cWould you like one?\u201d Richard Dawson gestures, shyly. We\u2019re here because of Dawson\u2019s one-of-a-kind, state-of-the-nation new opus, which is called, very simply, 2020, and has been hailed by more than one reviewer as a masterpiece. It\u2019s a record about the bleak lives of civil servants, convulsing fulfilment centre workers, and homeless people sleeping in alleyways next to happy families coming out of Nando\u2019s. It\u2019s a very different proposition to his last LP, 2017\u2019s Peasant, a research-heavy odyssey set between AD400 and 600, mixing together the rawer moments of folk, punk\u2019s attack and squiggling psychedelia. It nevertheless made many end-of-year lists, partly because Dawson has a way with a tune despite his avant garde leanings, but also because of his incredible voice. At times, it\u2019s the plangent roar of an ancient summoner. At others, it\u2019s a sad, high quiver, as if Neil Young had gone northern. (When I first saw Dawson sing a cappella at the 2017 Green Man festival, the power of the experience floored me: I was rooted to the spot, agog and in tears.) 2020 adds BBC 6 Music-friendly poppy choruses and riffs to Dawson\u2019s musical palette (bar one track, he plays every instrument on the album). Its first singles, Jogging and Two Halves, are particularly earwormy, but listen more closely. Jogging is about a man recently made redundant, getting paranoid about \u201cpeople getting nastier\u201d in lonely middle England. Two Halves describes a boy playing football and being hectored from the touchline, leaping between comedy (\u201cstop fannying around\u201d) and tortured sadness (\u201cat the final whistle I am inconsolable\u201d). \u201cI wanted to make these almost anthemic choruses, so it sounds like pop or what have you,\u201d Dawson begins, arranging two chairs in the corner of the studio, his bananas now sitting next to him on an amp. \u201cSome sort of slightly skewed version of what might be coming out of someone\u2019s radio, for the songs to seem quite glorious, but once you start digesting them a bit, they get stuck in your throat. Maybe like a slight queasiness.\u201d He describes his approach, and indeed lots of things today, in sweetly wonky terms. \u201cThe sound\u2019s a bit more, \u2018I\u2019ve seen that outfit before\u2019, but the clothes are a bit too small for the people in the songs. Or too baggy. Like these more standard kinds of modes would not fit the characters well. So we click into something else, something deeper, as we listen.\u201d Born in 1981, Dawson was the youngest of three children in an upwardly mobile Newcastle family. (\u201cWe moved into a house with dado rails when I was little,\u201d he says, by way of explanation. \u201cOoh! We\u2019ve made it!\u201d) His mother was an A&amp;E paediatric nurse who became a child protection officer, his father a packaging worker who was twice made redundant, then became a running coach. Dawson\u2019s older sister Gina and brother were sporty too, and now work in that field; the young Dawson, conversely, was a bit of a swot. \u201cBut then I really messed up at school. Because once I got my guitar, I was just obsessed with songs. Everything else disappeared.\u201d Dawson was the kid who put a poster up in the canteen wanting somebody to be in his band, who spent hours watching Iron Maiden videos. \u201cAll the big sets and the moves!

Turns out you don\u2019t need to be gay after all. There are some wonderful people of the opposite sex out there, you just haven\u2019t found them yet.</p> <p>This \u201cadvice\u201d is brought to you by actor-singer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/miley-cyrus\">Miley Cyrus</a> who is currently having a heterosexual dalliance with a man called Cody Simpson, who has very blonde hair and is a God amongst the tweens. Last Sunday Cyrus and Simpson giggled together on Instagram Live while Cyrus <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/eleanorbate/miley-cyrus-gay-men-evil-cody-simpson\">shared some relationship advice</a>.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t give up,\u201d Cyrus told her audience. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be gay, there are good people with dicks out there, you just gotta find them. You just gotta find a dick that\u2019s not a dick, you know what I mean?\u201d</p> <p>Cyrus continued this eloquent train of thought: \u201cI always thought I had to be gay, because I just thought all guys are evil, but that\u2019s not true,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are good people out there that just happen to have dicks. I\u2019ve only ever met one, and he\u2019s on this live.\u201d</p> <p>If you don\u2019t know much about Cyrus\u2019s personal life because you have far better things to do with your own life, a quick recap: the star used to be married to Liam Hemsworth and then briefly dated Kaitlynn Carter before shacking up with Simpson. Despite largely dating men, Cyrus has been very vocal about the fact she is \u201cpansexual\u201d and \u201cgenderqueer\u201d, so her flippant comments came as a shock to many. Pretty much every single queer person out there has been told that their sexuality is just a phase, or they haven\u2019t found the right person to be heterosexual with yet; hearing those damaging misconceptions repeated by a celebrity who has made much of her own queerness is hugely disappointing. Also disappointing is the fact that Cyrus\u2019s comments about \u201cevil men\u201d propagate the idea that lesbians are man-haters who \u201cchoose\u201d to be gay because they can\u2019t stand dudes.</p> <p>Following a backlash, Cyrus went on Instagram again to <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Culture/miley-cyrus-clarifies-gay-comments/story?id=66441504\">clarify the matter</a>. \u201cI was talking shit about sucky guys, but let me be clear, YOU don\u2019t CHOOSE your sexuality,\u201d she wrote. \u201cYou are born as you are. It has always been my priority to protect the LGBTQ community I am part of.\u201d</p> <p>Sorry Cyrus, but I think you need to do a little better than that. Calling yourself \u201cpansexual\u201d or \u201cgenderqueer\u201d does not give you carte blanche to repeat damaging stereotypes about the queer community. You don\u2019t get to use queerness as an exotic PR platform one day and then turn around and treat homosexuality as the losers\u2019 option the next. Cyrus may brush off her comments as a joke but excuse me if I don\u2019t find anything particularly funny about a couple in a heterosexual relationship giggling over the woman\u2019s gay past like it is a hilarious phase. Cyrus has an enormous platform and a young fan base; what she says matters. Particularly during a time when <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2019/06/28/anti-gay-hate-crimes-rise-fbi-says-and-they-likely-undercount/1582614001/\">LGBTQ hate crime is on the rise</a>. You don\u2019t choose your sexuality as she belatedly pointed out.

      "bodyText": "Sign up for The week in patriarchy, a newsletter on feminism and sexism sent every Saturday. Miley Cyrus needs to get her facts straight Huddle around homosexuals, I have great news! Turns out you don\u2019t need to be gay after all. There are some wonderful people of the opposite sex out there, you just haven\u2019t found them yet. This \u201cadvice\u201d is brought to you by actor-singer Miley Cyrus who is currently having a heterosexual dalliance with a man called Cody Simpson, who has very blonde hair and is a God amongst the tweens. Last Sunday Cyrus and Simpson giggled together on Instagram Live while Cyrus shared some relationship advice. \u201cDon\u2019t give up,\u201d Cyrus told her audience. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be gay, there are good people with dicks out there, you just gotta find them. You just gotta find a dick that\u2019s not a dick, you know what I mean?\u201d Cyrus continued this eloquent train of thought: \u201cI always thought I had to be gay, because I just thought all guys are evil, but that\u2019s not true,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are good people out there that just happen to have dicks. I\u2019ve only ever met one, and he\u2019s on this live.\u201d If you don\u2019t know much about Cyrus\u2019s personal life because you have far better things to do with your own life, a quick recap: the star used to be married to Liam Hemsworth and then briefly dated Kaitlynn Carter before shacking up with Simpson. Despite largely dating men, Cyrus has been very vocal about the fact she is \u201cpansexual\u201d and \u201cgenderqueer\u201d, so her flippant comments came as a shock to many. Pretty much every single queer person out there has been told that their sexuality is just a phase, or they haven\u2019t found the right person to be heterosexual with yet; hearing those damaging misconceptions repeated by a celebrity who has made much of her own queerness is hugely disappointing. Also disappointing is the fact that Cyrus\u2019s comments about \u201cevil men\u201d propagate the idea that lesbians are man-haters who \u201cchoose\u201d to be gay because they can\u2019t stand dudes. Following a backlash, Cyrus went on Instagram again to clarify the matter. \u201cI was talking shit about sucky guys, but let me be clear, YOU don\u2019t CHOOSE your sexuality,\u201d she wrote. \u201cYou are born as you are. It has always been my priority to protect the LGBTQ community I am part of.\u201d Sorry Cyrus, but I think you need to do a little better than that. Calling yourself \u201cpansexual\u201d or \u201cgenderqueer\u201d does not give you carte blanche to repeat damaging stereotypes about the queer community. You don\u2019t get to use queerness as an exotic PR platform one day and then turn around and treat homosexuality as the losers\u2019 option the next. Cyrus may brush off her comments as a joke but excuse me if I don\u2019t find anything particularly funny about a couple in a heterosexual relationship giggling over the woman\u2019s gay past like it is a hilarious phase. Cyrus has an enormous platform and a young fan base; what she says matters. Particularly during a time when LGBTQ hate crime is on the rise. You don\u2019t choose your sexuality as she belatedly pointed out. But you do choose to be a moron.

Over-50s account for about 924,000 of a record 3.2 million people who regularly work through the night. The figure has increased by 173,000 over the past five years as older people stay in work longer and more such jobs are created, like those in social care, according to the analysis by the Trades Union Congress (TUC). The research indicated that 222,000 people over the age of 60 were working nights, and 69,000 aged over 65. The TUC said the number of people regularly working night shifts was at its highest level since official records began in 2005, and the figure is 100,000 higher compared with five years ago. Over-50s account for all of the increase in overnight work since 2014, while fewer young people do late shifts, the union said. The TUC general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady, said working unsociable hours can disrupt a person\u2019s family life and affect their health.

The government is not doing enough to protect these workers. They need better notice of their shifts and proper compensation if work is cancelled.\u201d Jobs most likely to involve night shifts include care work, nursing, road transport and security, the report said. A study in 2018 found that working night shifts can disrupt the body\u2019s natural rhythms so much that the brain and digestive system end up completely out of kilter with one another. Patrick Thomson, from the Centre for Ageing Better, said it was important to ensure that people were not being pushed into strenuous, insecure or isolated work at unsociable hours through a lack of alternative available work. He added: \u201cMany more of us are living and working for longer, so we need to make sure that jobs are designed to support our changing needs as we age, whether they are for flexible working, planning for retirement, caring for others or managing a health condition. \u201cWith increasing numbers of over-50s in night jobs that can often be arduous, it\u2019s ever more important that employers can support health at work.\u201d The government is proposing changes that would give flexible workers, including night workers, new rights and protections.

      "bodyText": "Theresa May was \u201csurly\u201d and \u201cnot particularly pleasant\u201d during the Tories\u2019 ill-fated general election campaign in 2017, her former joint chief of staff has claimed. Fiona Hill was forced to become the former prime minister\u2019s full-time minder after she \u201cbegan to crumble\u201d amid mounting criticism, according to a new biography, which says May insisted that she did not want the presidential-style campaign to be focused on her. Historian Sir Anthony Seldon has interviewed nearly all of the most influential figures during her premiership for his book, May at 10, and he concluded that the campaign \u201ccruelly exposed her unusually inflexible and introverted character\u201d. The biography, serialised in the Times, describes the initial reaction to the Tory manifesto as positive but claims that the controversy over the eventually revised social care policy \u2013 labelled the \u201cdementia tax\u201d \u2013 led to the unravelling of May\u2019s credibility. \u201cHer team had thought the most likely manifesto backlash would come over a fuel allowance change,\u201d he writes. \u201cSocial care had played well in focus groups when tested. [May\u2019s election adviser Lynton] Crosby approved of it. The sceptic was Hill, who foresaw what would happen. \u201cIt became the focus of her most bitter disagreement with [fellow No 10 chief of staff Nick] Timothy during their time together in No 10. May backed him. \u2018If I don\u2019t have it in my manifesto, it will become an empty manifesto,\u2019 she said.\u201d Former aides of May told Seldon that she sought to avoid speaking to journalists or revealing personal details. \u201cThis is not what I believe in,\u201d she would reportedly say. \u201cI want to be out campaigning.\u201d Hill, with Timothy, said she was forced to travel by May\u2019s side. \u201cShe was surly and not particularly pleasant,\u201d she told Seldon. \u201cShe was very quiet and seemed unhappy.\u201d Another said: \u201cShe was a terrible campaigner. She came across as grumpy, entitled and expecting to win, and then visibly irritated when she came under scrutiny.\u201d The Conservatives had been expected to win a landslide victory in June 2017, but although the party increased its share of the vote it lost 13 seats and its majority as support for Labour surged. However, after the election result May is said to have blamed her advisers and \u201ccomplained bitterly that she had done exactly what they had told her to do and this was the result\u201d. In the aftermath, Timothy offered to resign, at which point Hill recalls May as saying: \u201cI think you both need to resign.\u201d May, whose premiership lasted slightly longer than Neville Chamberlain\u2019s, was also criticised over what was said to be her failure to show a strong face to the public after terrorist attacks in Manchester and London. Seldon, the vice-chancellor of the University of Buckingham who has also written political biographies of Margaret Thatcher, John Major, Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and David Cameron, writes that the campaign \u201ccruelly exposed her unusually inflexible and introverted character\u201d. But he reveals that May did not appear to have the final say over some of the messaging. She is said not to have liked the \u201cstrong and stable\u201d slogan. \u201cI\u2019m the leader of the Conservative party, not a presidential candidate,\u201d May said, according to the book. \u201cI\u2019m not comfortable.

      "body": "<p>The atmosphere inside the <a href=\"https://www.robinson.cam.ac.uk/college-life/red-brick-cafe-bar\" title=\"\">Red Brick Cafe Bar</a> on the night of 11 February 2018 was unexpectedly raucous. The Robinson College student venue \u2013 which, alongside undergrad-cheap pints, sells bags of dried pasta and tins of baked beans \u2013 was booked for an evening of music and comedy from a lineup of black and minority ethnic (BME) Cambridge University students. When one of the acts, standup comic Hasan Al-Habib, arrived, however, he was surprised to see the bar packed with revellers, many obviously drunk from a beer festival that had run throughout the day. So many people had spilled into the venue that the audience for the open-mic night had been pushed into a corner. \u201cI walked in and immediately knew it was going to be terrible,\u201d Habib recalls.</p> <p>At 8pm the lights fell and, undeterred, the first act struggled to make her rendition of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1TKfqSdEtQ\" title=\"\">Nina Simone\u2019s </a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1TKfqSdEtQ\" title=\"\">I Loves You Porgy</a> heard over the din. Next, Habib, a Muslim who grew up in Birmingham, took to the stage. The point of the evening was to provide a space where BME performers could articulate their frustrations and struggles, and Habib had included a few jokes about race. \u201cMicroaggressions are small acts of everyday discrimination, but they do build up,\u201d he ventured. \u201cThey can be really subtle things, like someone saying, \u2018Where are you actually from?\u2019 or, \u2018Your English is really good.\u2019 Or, \u2018What\u2019s in the bag, you fucking terrorist?\u2019\u201d Most of the crowd talked over the punchline. Habib limped through the rest of the set.</p> <p>After a second standup act, the organisers took a break to address some technical issues. While the performers encouraged one another in a back room, one of the night\u2019s organisers, Sara Poursafar, entered in tears. There had been a complaint, she explained, that Habib\u2019s material was \u201cracist to white people\u201d. Customers had told bar staff they wanted to dance, not listen to comedy, she added. Despite the fact that the venue was booked, staff had decided to cancel the event. Poursafar was told she was free to reschedule.</p> <p>Every standup comic has endured a rough gig in front of an uninterested crowd, but this was something else. \u201cLiterally and metaphorically, the night was created as a space for BME students to be heard,\u201d Poursafar wrote <a href=\"https://flygirlsofcambridge.com/2018/02/11/statement-on-bme-open-mic-night-sara-poursafar-and-michelle-wong/\" title=\"\">in a blog</a><a href=\"https://flygirlsofcambridge.com/2018/02/11/statement-on-bme-open-mic-night-sara-poursafar-and-michelle-wong/\" title=\"\">post</a> the following morning. The cancellation had sent a clear message, she argued: \u201cWhite comfort is more important than BME voices.\u201d</p> <p>In any other city, the cancellation of a student comedy night would be provincial news. But Cambridge is home to <a href=\"https://www.cambridgefootlights.org/\" title=\"\">Footlights</a>, Britain\u2019s most illustrious and elite comedy society. Throughout the 20th century and well into the 21st, Footlights has been the club where writers, performers and producers meet as students and move, seemingly without friction, into establishment jobs in radio, television and film.

If an industry routinely accused of being too white and too male is to diversify, Cambridge student comedy has a key role to play in nurturing precisely the kind of new voices booked at the Red Brick Cafe Bar.

The contestant, David Mitchell\u2019s double-act partner <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/robert-webb\" title=\"\">Robert Webb</a>, was asked what advice he might give to someone hoping for a career in comedy. \u201cHe gave this long-winded answer about Footlights,\u201d Habib recalled. \u201cAt the end, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/john-humphrys\" title=\"\">John Humphrys</a> said, \u2018So, basically what you\u2019re saying is go to Cambridge?\u2019 Webb laughed and said, \u2018Yeah.\u2019 And I thought, OK, I\u2019ll go to Cambridge.\u201d</p> <p>At 18, Habib applied to study chemical engineering. He was pooled (recommended for consideration by colleges other than the one to which he had applied), then rejected. He took a year out, then reapplied, only to be pooled and rejected again. After three years studying biochemistry at Imperial College London, he took his master\u2019s in radiation biology at Oxford University. Then, in a final effort to enter Footlights\u2019 orbit, he applied for a PhD at Cambridge. Finally he received an offer. A few weeks later, at the university freshers\u2019 fair, Habib spied the Footlights stand. Here was the institution within an institution that, for seven years, had been his siren call. \u201cI could have cried,\u201d he recalls.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e2308960ecf7557a7cdac9668a6b8e3a7a7afbe9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e2308960ecf7557a7cdac9668a6b8e3a7a7afbe9/206_208_2904_1743/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Robert Webb and David Mitchell, 2005.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Footlights alumni Robert Webb and David Mitchell, 2005.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Despite the club\u2019s daunting history, Habib was confident that he could secure a spot performing in a \u201csmoker\u201d, the name given to Footlights\u2019 informal late-night performances. (A contraction of \u201csmoking concerts\u201d, the smokers of the early 1900s were cabaret nights watched by an exclusively male audience wearing dinner jackets; today women are permitted to both watch and perform, but smoking is forbidden.) Having regularly performed standup in London, Habib felt his material was strong. But three consecutive auditions in 2016, in which he performed routines about growing up in a Muslim household and joked about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2014/nov/03/isis-in-crisis-is-downton-abbey-dog-best-character-die\" title=\"\">Isis (the dog from Downto</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2014/nov/03/isis-in-crisis-is-downton-abbey-dog-best-character-die\" title=\"\">n Abbey)</a>, were met with silence by the all-white judging panel.</p> <p>First years who try out for Footlights shows are often left disappointed. (Webb, who describes the Footlights committee as \u201cthe ruling elite, the cr\u00e8me de la clown\u201d, was turned down in every audition during his first year.) Still, Habib suspected the theme, not the quality, of his work had led to his trio of rejections. \u201cYou could just see this reaction on their faces, like, \u2018There is no way we can laugh at this,\u2019\u201d he recalls. (When he finally performed the Isis the dog sketch at a smoker the following year, it received a warm reception.)</p> <p>Habib is not alone in his suspicion that the lack of cultural diversity in Footlights at that time created an unconscious bias against certain kinds of material. \u201cOld-fashioned sketch comedy, in the style of Monty Python or Peter Cook, say, has a very white, specifically English sensibility,\u201d says Wang who, like Habib, applied to Cambridge principally to join Footlights. \u201cIf the committee adheres too much to those old sensibilities, those who don\u2019t embody them \u2013 who maybe, like me, also grew up on American standup and Asian comedy \u2013 can feel shut out during auditions.\u201d</p> <p>Exclusivity goes against the founding tenets of the club, which was started as a rival to Cambridge\u2019s <a href=\"https://cuadc.org/\" title=\"\">Amateur Dramatic Club</a> (ADC), membership of which was once described as being limited to old members of the Eton and Harrow cricket elevens. In more recent times, Footlights has failed to reflect the diversity of the broader university population. While former club presidents include the comedians <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/richard-ayoade\" title=\"\">Richard Ayoade</a>, whose father is Nigerian, and Wang, whose father is Malaysian, diversity in the club has continued to lag behind that of the wider university, where <a href=\"https://www.cam.ac.uk/news/increase-in-black-student-numbers\" title=\"\">26.8% </a><a href=\"https://www.cam.ac.uk/news/increase-in-black-student-numbers\" title=\"\">of students currently identify as BME</a>. \u201cFrom my first foray into Footlights, I was hyperaware of the lack of BME comedians involved,\u201d says Adrianna Hunt, a biracial student and current member of Footlights. \u201cIt compounded the overwhelming feeling of impostor syndrome, which naturally comes with studying at Cambridge when your identity diverges from white and privately educated.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5819a44a34c10f896969ca1633275ba84fb48421\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5819a44a34c10f896969ca1633275ba84fb48421/67_794_3416_4267/801.jpg\" alt=\"Current member Adrianna Hunt\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Current member Adrianna Hunt: \u2018We are at the beginning of a long journey to make Footlights more accessible.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gareth Iwan Jones/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When Alex Franklin, who performed and wrote for Footlights\u2019 Edinburgh show this year, appeared in a Footlights sketch show in his first year, it became, he says, \u201cone of the most, if not <em>the</em> most diverse comedy night that year\u201d (his mother is Chinese). The singular background of the Footlights committee had, seemingly, resulted in a kind of collective myopia; material about race was usually rejected. \u201cMany of the old guard perceived it as too \u2018edgy\u2019 to be performed under the name of a supposedly apolitical society,\u201d Hunt says. (While Footlights has a long tradition of lampooning political figures, overtly political material has traditionally been discouraged, members say; though the choice to keep material apolitical is, of course, a political one.)</p> <p>In response, Habib began performing at BME-only open mic nights around Cambridge, where his politically charged material was actively encouraged \u2013 until the show at the Red Brick Cafe Bar.</p> <p>***</p> <p>The shutdown that night would prove to be a watershed moment in Cambridge comedy. At first, the story went broadly unnoticed. Varsity, a student paper, reported it, but there was little fallout from an incident one attendee, Jun Pang, claimed revealed the \u201cinability of white people to handle jokes about whiteness\u201d. No apologies were made and Footlights \u2013 by far the most powerful Cambridge comedy society \u2013 issued no statement.</p> <p>A month later, the university hosted one of its best-known comedy nights, the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/wolfsonhowler/\" title=\"\">Wolfson Howler</a>, where students perform alongside professional comics (previous headliners include <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/joshwiddicombe\" title=\"\">Josh Widdicombe</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sara-pascoe\" title=\"\">Sara Pascoe</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/aug/06/desiree-burch-how-dominatrix-comic-plans-to-top-fringe-hit\" title=\"\">Desiree Burch</a> and <a href=\"https://www.paulsinha.com/\" title=\"\">Paul Sinha</a>). The 2018 event took place on International Women\u2019s Day but, due to a last-minute drop-out, featured an all-male lineup. This time, Footlights did not remain silent. The next day the club\u2019s president, Ruby Keane, issued a statement criticising the lack of female representation. It was, she wrote on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/cambridgefootlights/\" title=\"\">the Footlights Facebook page</a>, \u201ca seriously misjudged move from one of Cambridge\u2019s most high-profile gigs\u201d.</p> <p>This public call-out rankled Habib. In the comments beneath the post, he pointed out Footlights\u2019 all-white audition panel and the fact that the club\u2019s largest show of the year, <a href=\"https://www.varsity.co.uk/theatre/14977\" title=\"\">the Spring Revue</a>, had had an all-white lineup. \u201cPretty much everything you do,\u201d he wrote, accusingly, \u201cis all-white.\u201d</p> <p>Habib\u2019s comments \u201cset off a snowball effect\u201d, he says. Keane deleted her post; another member of the committee claimed Habib\u2019s accusations could \u201cdiscourage BME performers from auditioning\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>People who are privately educated come to Cambridge ready to perform comedy. They know how to put on a show</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>With tensions high, Keane called a meeting to tackle what she describes as \u201cFootlights\u2019 racial \u2018blind spot\u2019. \u201cKeane says she wrote to the 11 other committee members, asking them to attend, but only two showed up. Nevertheless, the decision was made to host an open meeting in the Maypole pub next to the ADC theatre, home of the Footlights, where BME performers could air their grievances and discuss potential solutions. Keane, along with fellow committee member Louisa Keight, scheduled an event to take place a few days later.</p> <p>Attendees recall a spirit of historic reckoning reminiscent of that forced by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/eric-idle\" title=\"\">Eric Idle</a> who, in 1964, helped secure the admission of women as members. (Women had been accepted as performers since the late 50s, but not members; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/germainegreer\" title=\"\">Germaine Greer</a>, then a mature student from the University of Melbourne, became the first female Footlight.) </p> <p>This time, ten of the eleven Footlights committee members attended. \u201cIt was rammed,\u201d recalls Habib, who estimates between 50 and 80 performers showed up. Ken Cheng, a former committee member who, in 2015, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p06gsxtr\" title=\"\">reached the final of the BBC </a><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p06gsxtr\" title=\"\">new </a><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p06gsxtr\" title=\"\">comedy </a><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p06gsxtr\" title=\"\">award</a>, compered. Cheng, who is British-born Chinese, invited BME members of the audience to begin by sharing their perspectives. There was no shortage of volunteers and people spoke, uninterrupted, for a full hour. \u201cMultiple problems were raised,\u201d Franklin recalls. \u201cWe discussed why Footlights was so disproportionately white, so private school-dominated, the huge problem of nepotism and how that accentuates biases.\u201d</p> <p>Unlike many other clubs at Cambridge, the Footlights\u2019 committee was, at the time, hand-picked by the outgoing members. It was claimed they would often choose friends or people they went to school with. The situation was galling, people at the meeting explained, because of the powers this conferred: members can cast themselves as a writer or a performer in any of the society\u2019s shows, including the one that goes to the Edinburgh fringe, one of the largest comedy festivals in the world, and performs in front of prospective agents. \u201cPeople who weren\u2019t actually very good were still getting on the committee and performing at Footlights Spring Revues,\u201d Habib says. </p> <p>Keane agreed there was a need for systemic change. She proposed moving to an open-voting system, which would block the outgoing committee from choosing their friends to replace them. \u201cWe agreed that anyone who had performed comedy in Cambridge should be able to sign up to vote,\u201d she says. But while the conclusions of the meeting were unanimously agreed by the three Footlights members in attendance, when Keane reported back to the rest of the committee, she was overruled. \u201cI think they had benefited from the system, and they weren\u2019t keen to see it change,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Having publicly promised change, Keane felt unable to continue in her role as president. In a resignation email sent to the Footlights mailing list later that week, she wrote: \u201cI hope\u2026 I have proven how sincerely I believe the committee and voting system needs to change if we\u2019re ever going to have an inclusive comedy scene in Cambridge. In many ways it comes down to who is \u2018in\u2019 and who is \u2018out\u2019, and how incredibly hard it is to get \u2018in\u2019.\u201d She urged the committee members to consider supporting open auditions and open-mic nights.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cb105f5c143d3d7894f1594b1931a771a650cf87\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb105f5c143d3d7894f1594b1931a771a650cf87/270_555_4307_2584/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Monty Python members Graham Chapman, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, John Cleese and Michael Palin, 1970\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Monty Python members Graham Chapman, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, John Cleese and Michael Palin, 1970.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Keane\u2019s resignation made the national news. \u201cDiversity row at Cambridge Footlights as its president quits over lack of opportunities for non-white students,\u201d ran <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5568427/Cambridge-Footlights-comedy-society-embroiled-diversity-row-president-resigns.html\" title=\"\">one Daily Mail headline</a>, to a stream of furious reader comments accusing Keane of being a \u201csilly girl\u201d and \u201centitled little thing\u201d. Meanwhile, some members of the committee refused to acknowledge Keane\u2019s resignation as one of protest, alleging she was pushed out after a miscommunication resulted in Footlights being temporarily deregistered as a university club. (Keane says the allegation was \u201ca needless deflection of the issues at hand\u201d.)</p> <p>But her surprise resignation had a ripple effect. When the year ended, the committee members who had been against reform moved on, and the new committee went ahead and implemented everything Keane had promised. In 2019, for the first time in its 136-year history, Footlights is without a president, led, instead, by a democratically <a href=\"https://www.cambridgefootlights.org/members\" title=\"\">elected committee</a>. \u201cIt\u2019s not that we\u2019ll never have a president again,\u201d says Amelia Hill, the current secretary. \u201cBut while the society remains in a transitional phase, this is the way we need to be organised.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>Close to midnight, in a snug venue at this year\u2019s Edinburgh festival fringe, Habib took to the stage alongside fellow Cambridge students <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100013316774927&amp;__tn__=K-R&amp;eid=ARCNnNwSvsIK-6OG1K9UnPfK-IshHpaX-cLY3KpLZ-dcNk8_j00MwIxDsgsYNfjvLuTZh_jzrfCjU_CH&amp;fref=mentions&amp;__xts__[0]=68.ARAAcc-lQBlQrNvQGyRAdS77-Yg8nA8JzVWiOd8RA1r5mGw1zgg9txMEGFegsTUseNaEX70MMuebMxV16KqJNK65fVlD3HPQaTpJX_Z4vmMDz0b9VA1aZVHdiFan7jL7GnCRYpKDHXSUf1vBqTVdLpS-04qPHzAesC8yH6-EMM8E6RGgznPjWKFlWXOmSC7HFbHJVb4IbHjktjndn_j8g4zcokhFODlGpzRjQ5QGGQj4WGC7ZaJM8-ycrb6uOWtTKgvGPzHt3Y4L85Tpj3oLWkW1WSlf_QeD8bJXKyG8Sq2cQ1DN3LHFoxUeTHn3oPJjDbF5N2Ktem7wlXT24g_yo7k\" title=\"\">Danny Baalbaki</a> and Patrick Sylla. The trio call themselves the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/footdarks?lang=ko\" title=\"\">Foot</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/footdarks?lang=ko\" title=\"\">Darks</a> (\u201cWe prefer alt-white,\u201d they joke in the blurb for their event) and are the first BME-only troupe of Footlights performers. \u201cWe are not the only two Muslims in Footlights. We are the only two Muslims in Cambridge,\u201d Habib jokes, as he introduces Baalbaki to the tightly squeezed-in audience. Their set is deliciously funny and challenging in the way it engages with race, class and privilege \u2013 politically pointed in a way that the main Footlights show, performed across the road in a more leisurely afternoon slot, is not.</p> <p>A few hours before the night\u2019s performance, I meet the three young men in the courtyard of a Hotel du Vin. Despite <a href=\"https://www.comedy.co.uk/fringe/2019/footdarks/\" title=\"\">performing at </a><a href=\"https://www.comedy.co.uk/fringe/2019/footdarks/\" title=\"\">the Edinburgh fringe</a>, Baalbaki and Sylla tell me they still don\u2019t feel as if they belong here. It is a sense of alienation that was instilled, Baalbaki says, at school. \u201cI was sat down by my teacher and told: \u2018We saw you put Cambridge down as an option. You should take it out.\u2019\u201d Nobody at his school had received an Oxbridge offer before. \u201cThey said, \u2018If anyone\u2019s going to go there, it\u2019s not going to be you.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSome teachers told me to lower my sights,\u201d says Sylla, who was also discouraged. \u201cI had a teacher who said, \u2018In the past, we wouldn\u2019t have suggested for certain kids to go to Oxbridge, because they\u2019ll have a hard time.\u2019 He meant black kids. I was like, \u2018You\u2019re an old white dude who is on my side, and even you think it\u2019s going to be hard for me.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Messages like these teach a child, Sylla argues, that they do not have a right to exist in certain spaces. \u201cPeople who are privately educated come to Cambridge ready to perform comedy. They\u2019ve done plays, they\u2019ve done drama, they\u2019ve done theatre, they know how to put on a show. They\u2019ve grown up with a sense of belonging.\u201d For years, Footlights has earned a high proportion of its income by staging workshops and performances at private schools. A lack of exposure heightens the sense of alienation for minorities when auditioning for it, Baalbaki says. \u201cIf you come from a similar kind of school to those on the panel, you share a sensibility. You share cultural capital. So there\u2019s an instant divide.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>With so much fame and privilege behind this society, we should use that power for good</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This year, as part of the swingeing changes to the way in which Footlights operates, the society visited state schools in Manchester, Chester, Essex, Croydon and Dorset to host workshops for less-advantaged pupils \u2013 the first time, in recent years at least, that the club has made a concerted effort to engage with institutions from which it would not turn a profit (the troupe performed ticketed events in each town, using the proceeds to pay for the school visits). \u201cWe taught some general acting for the younger kids, demonstrated what a pullback and reveal was,\u201d Hill explains. Many students, she says, have no understanding of the term \u201csketch comedy\u201d until they explain it is similar to the skits they see on YouTube or the website <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/collegehumor?app=desktop\" title=\"\">College</a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/collegehumor?app=desktop\" title=\"\">Humo</a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/collegehumor?app=desktop\" title=\"\">r</a>. \u201cIt just gives them a little head start,\u201d she adds.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a727aaee6549665dee64c9f852a34d3b02f33ae3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a727aaee6549665dee64c9f852a34d3b02f33ae3/37_836_3794_4742/800.jpg\" alt=\"Former Footlights president Phil Wang.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Former Footlights president Phil Wang.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While the society\u2019s 2018 crisis may seem like a closed chapter, the challenge now is to lock in change. \u201cWe are still very much at the beginning of a long journey to making the Footlights more accessible and open,\u201d Hunt says. As well as an increase in the number of BME-only comedy nights, Footlights now supports <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/stockingscomedy/\" title=\"\">Stockings</a>, comedy nights for women to try out jokes in a supportive environment. Footlights\u2019 membership system has been overhauled. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to set elected roles in stone to avoid nepotism in those future years when, for example, you have a lot of friends coming together,\u201d Hill says. \u201cWe can\u2019t guarantee it; we can only hope. But with so much fame and privilege behind this society, we should use that power for good.\u201d</p> <p>Not everyone is convinced of the usefulness of women- or BME-only nights, however. \u201cThe unforeseen negative effect of putting on special nights is that, if you give a certain demographic their special night, it can feel like you\u2019ve ticked the box, so there\u2019s no need for more profound change,\u201d says Wang, whose mother studied at Cambridge in the 70s and encouraged her son to apply. \u201cThe imperative is on Footlights to ensure they\u2019re diverse. Measures towards inclusion shouldn\u2019t wind up having the effect of segregation.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s an argument Sylla understands: \u201cIf people from ethnic minority backgrounds perform only at their shows, it creates separation,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I can\u2019t communicate the awkwardness of arriving somewhere and not understanding how to navigate the spaces. In my experience, these nights create a space where people who wouldn\u2019t otherwise feel comfortable are able to perform.\u201d</p> <p>The issues with which Footlights has been reckoning reflect those in the wider industry. \u201cFrom a purely comedic perspective, diversity of voices is just more interesting,\u201d Hunt says. She became so fed up in her first year of hearing similar jokes about middle-class \u201cquirks\u201d that she kept a tally of the times hummus was mentioned on stage.

Diversity of membership means diversity of perspective.

      "bodyText": "The atmosphere inside the Red Brick Cafe Bar on the night of 11 February 2018 was unexpectedly raucous. The Robinson College student venue \u2013 which, alongside undergrad-cheap pints, sells bags of dried pasta and tins of baked beans \u2013 was booked for an evening of music and comedy from a lineup of black and minority ethnic (BME) Cambridge University students. When one of the acts, standup comic Hasan Al-Habib, arrived, however, he was surprised to see the bar packed with revellers, many obviously drunk from a beer festival that had run throughout the day. So many people had spilled into the venue that the audience for the open-mic night had been pushed into a corner. \u201cI walked in and immediately knew it was going to be terrible,\u201d Habib recalls. At 8pm the lights fell and, undeterred, the first act struggled to make her rendition of Nina Simone\u2019s I Loves You Porgy heard over the din. Next, Habib, a Muslim who grew up in Birmingham, took to the stage. The point of the evening was to provide a space where BME performers could articulate their frustrations and struggles, and Habib had included a few jokes about race. \u201cMicroaggressions are small acts of everyday discrimination, but they do build up,\u201d he ventured. \u201cThey can be really subtle things, like someone saying, \u2018Where are you actually from?\u2019 or, \u2018Your English is really good.\u2019 Or, \u2018What\u2019s in the bag, you fucking terrorist?\u2019\u201d Most of the crowd talked over the punchline. Habib limped through the rest of the set. After a second standup act, the organisers took a break to address some technical issues. While the performers encouraged one another in a back room, one of the night\u2019s organisers, Sara Poursafar, entered in tears. There had been a complaint, she explained, that Habib\u2019s material was \u201cracist to white people\u201d. Customers had told bar staff they wanted to dance, not listen to comedy, she added. Despite the fact that the venue was booked, staff had decided to cancel the event. Poursafar was told she was free to reschedule. Every standup comic has endured a rough gig in front of an uninterested crowd, but this was something else. \u201cLiterally and metaphorically, the night was created as a space for BME students to be heard,\u201d Poursafar wrote in a blogpost the following morning. The cancellation had sent a clear message, she argued: \u201cWhite comfort is more important than BME voices.\u201d In any other city, the cancellation of a student comedy night would be provincial news. But Cambridge is home to Footlights, Britain\u2019s most illustrious and elite comedy society. Throughout the 20th century and well into the 21st, Footlights has been the club where writers, performers and producers meet as students and move, seemingly without friction, into establishment jobs in radio, television and film. Its alumni have set the tone of cultural eras from the 60s to today, via shows such as Beyond The Fringe, Monty Python, The Goodies, Not The Nine O\u2019Clock News and, more recently, Peep Show, QI and The Great British Bake-Off. If an industry routinely accused of being too white and too male is to diversify, Cambridge student comedy has a key role to play in nurturing precisely the kind of new voices booked at the Red Brick Cafe Bar. Footlights\u2019 silence on the event was telling. Founded in 1883, Footlights has, during its 136-year history, produced a panoply of luminaries, including Peter Cook, John Cleese, Emma Thompson, Hugh Laurie, Douglas Adams, Sandi Toksvig and Stephen Fry. \u201cLike a night sky in the countryside, the more you look, the more stars you see,\u201d wrote comedian and Footlights alumnus David Mitchell in his 2013 memoir, Back Story. \u201cFootlights seem[s] to be behind about half of the stuff worth paying attention to.\u201d YouTube and podcasts, those freshly paved routes to success for young comedians, have done little to blunt the society\u2019s influence in recent times. Former Footlights members continue to dominate positions of power and influence \u2013 from Olivia Colman, this year\u2019s Oscar-winner for best actress, to John Oliver, America\u2019s leading satirist du jour. Standup and 2012 Footlights president Phil Wang describes membership as a form of entry to the comedy mafia. \u201cThere\u2019s a little nod,\u201d he tells me, of encountering a fellow former Footlight on the circuit, \u201cand you just know.\u201d For Habib, Footlights was the root of his ambition to study at Cambridge, seeded at the age of 15 when he watched an episode of Celebrity Mastermind. The contestant, David Mitchell\u2019s double-act partner Robert Webb, was asked what advice he might give to someone hoping for a career in comedy. \u201cHe gave this long-winded answer about Footlights,\u201d Habib recalled. \u201cAt the end, John Humphrys said, \u2018So, basically what you\u2019re saying is go to Cambridge?\u2019 Webb laughed and said, \u2018Yeah.\u2019 And I thought, OK, I\u2019ll go to Cambridge.\u201d At 18, Habib applied to study chemical engineering. He was pooled (recommended for consideration by colleges other than the one to which he had applied), then rejected. He took a year out, then reapplied, only to be pooled and rejected again. After three years studying biochemistry at Imperial College London, he took his master\u2019s in radiation biology at Oxford University. Then, in a final effort to enter Footlights\u2019 orbit, he applied for a PhD at Cambridge. Finally he received an offer. A few weeks later, at the university freshers\u2019 fair, Habib spied the Footlights stand. Here was the institution within an institution that, for seven years, had been his siren call. \u201cI could have cried,\u201d he recalls. Despite the club\u2019s daunting history, Habib was confident that he could secure a spot performing in a \u201csmoker\u201d, the name given to Footlights\u2019 informal late-night performances. (A contraction of \u201csmoking concerts\u201d, the smokers of the early 1900s were cabaret nights watched by an exclusively male audience wearing dinner jackets; today women are permitted to both watch and perform, but smoking is forbidden.) Having regularly performed standup in London, Habib felt his material was strong. But three consecutive auditions in 2016, in which he performed routines about growing up in a Muslim household and joked about Isis (the dog from Downton Abbey), were met with silence by the all-white judging panel. First years who try out for Footlights shows are often left disappointed. (Webb, who describes the Footlights committee as \u201cthe ruling elite, the cr\u00e8me de la clown\u201d, was turned down in every audition during his first year.) Still, Habib suspected the theme, not the quality, of his work had led to his trio of rejections. \u201cYou could just see this reaction on their faces, like, \u2018There is no way we can laugh at this,\u2019\u201d he recalls. (When he finally performed the Isis the dog sketch at a smoker the following year, it received a warm reception.) Habib is not alone in his suspicion that the lack of cultural diversity in Footlights at that time created an unconscious bias against certain kinds of material. \u201cOld-fashioned sketch comedy, in the style of Monty Python or Peter Cook, say, has a very white, specifically English sensibility,\u201d says Wang who, like Habib, applied to Cambridge principally to join Footlights. \u201cIf the committee adheres too much to those old sensibilities, those who don\u2019t embody them \u2013 who maybe, like me, also grew up on American standup and Asian comedy \u2013 can feel shut out during auditions.\u201d Exclusivity goes against the founding tenets of the club, which was started as a rival to Cambridge\u2019s Amateur Dramatic Club (ADC), membership of which was once described as being limited to old members of the Eton and Harrow cricket elevens. In more recent times, Footlights has failed to reflect the diversity of the broader university population. While former club presidents include the comedians Richard Ayoade, whose father is Nigerian, and Wang, whose father is Malaysian, diversity in the club has continued to lag behind that of the wider university, where 26.8% of students currently identify as BME. \u201cFrom my first foray into Footlights, I was hyperaware of the lack of BME comedians involved,\u201d says Adrianna Hunt, a biracial student and current member of Footlights. \u201cIt compounded the overwhelming feeling of impostor syndrome, which naturally comes with studying at Cambridge when your identity diverges from white and privately educated.\u201d When Alex Franklin, who performed and wrote for Footlights\u2019 Edinburgh show this year, appeared in a Footlights sketch show in his first year, it became, he says, \u201cone of the most, if not the most diverse comedy night that year\u201d (his mother is Chinese). The singular background of the Footlights committee had, seemingly, resulted in a kind of collective myopia; material about race was usually rejected. \u201cMany of the old guard perceived it as too \u2018edgy\u2019 to be performed under the name of a supposedly apolitical society,\u201d Hunt says. (While Footlights has a long tradition of lampooning political figures, overtly political material has traditionally been discouraged, members say; though the choice to keep material apolitical is, of course, a political one.) In response, Habib began performing at BME-only open mic nights around Cambridge, where his politically charged material was actively encouraged \u2013 until the show at the Red Brick Cafe Bar. *** The shutdown that night would prove to be a watershed moment in Cambridge comedy. At first, the story went broadly unnoticed. Varsity, a student paper, reported it, but there was little fallout from an incident one attendee, Jun Pang, claimed revealed the \u201cinability of white people to handle jokes about whiteness\u201d. No apologies were made and Footlights \u2013 by far the most powerful Cambridge comedy society \u2013 issued no statement. A month later, the university hosted one of its best-known comedy nights, the Wolfson Howler, where students perform alongside professional comics (previous headliners include Josh Widdicombe, Sara Pascoe, Desiree Burch and Paul Sinha). The 2018 event took place on International Women\u2019s Day but, due to a last-minute drop-out, featured an all-male lineup. This time, Footlights did not remain silent. The next day the club\u2019s president, Ruby Keane, issued a statement criticising the lack of female representation. It was, she wrote on the Footlights Facebook page, \u201ca seriously misjudged move from one of Cambridge\u2019s most high-profile gigs\u201d. This public call-out rankled Habib. In the comments beneath the post, he pointed out Footlights\u2019 all-white audition panel and the fact that the club\u2019s largest show of the year, the Spring Revue, had had an all-white lineup. \u201cPretty much everything you do,\u201d he wrote, accusingly, \u201cis all-white.\u201d Habib\u2019s comments \u201cset off a snowball effect\u201d, he says. Keane deleted her post; another member of the committee claimed Habib\u2019s accusations could \u201cdiscourage BME performers from auditioning\u201d. With tensions high, Keane called a meeting to tackle what she describes as \u201cFootlights\u2019 racial \u2018blind spot\u2019. \u201cKeane says she wrote to the 11 other committee members, asking them to attend, but only two showed up. Nevertheless, the decision was made to host an open meeting in the Maypole pub next to the ADC theatre, home of the Footlights, where BME performers could air their grievances and discuss potential solutions. Keane, along with fellow committee member Louisa Keight, scheduled an event to take place a few days later. Attendees recall a spirit of historic reckoning reminiscent of that forced by Eric Idle who, in 1964, helped secure the admission of women as members. (Women had been accepted as performers since the late 50s, but not members; Germaine Greer, then a mature student from the University of Melbourne, became the first female Footlight.) This time, ten of the eleven Footlights committee members attended. \u201cIt was rammed,\u201d recalls Habib, who estimates between 50 and 80 performers showed up. Ken Cheng, a former committee member who, in 2015, reached the final of the BBC new comedy award, compered. Cheng, who is British-born Chinese, invited BME members of the audience to begin by sharing their perspectives. There was no shortage of volunteers and people spoke, uninterrupted, for a full hour. \u201cMultiple problems were raised,\u201d Franklin recalls. \u201cWe discussed why Footlights was so disproportionately white, so private school-dominated, the huge problem of nepotism and how that accentuates biases.\u201d Unlike many other clubs at Cambridge, the Footlights\u2019 committee was, at the time, hand-picked by the outgoing members. It was claimed they would often choose friends or people they went to school with. The situation was galling, people at the meeting explained, because of the powers this conferred: members can cast themselves as a writer or a performer in any of the society\u2019s shows, including the one that goes to the Edinburgh fringe, one of the largest comedy festivals in the world, and performs in front of prospective agents. \u201cPeople who weren\u2019t actually very good were still getting on the committee and performing at Footlights Spring Revues,\u201d Habib says. Keane agreed there was a need for systemic change. She proposed moving to an open-voting system, which would block the outgoing committee from choosing their friends to replace them. \u201cWe agreed that anyone who had performed comedy in Cambridge should be able to sign up to vote,\u201d she says. But while the conclusions of the meeting were unanimously agreed by the three Footlights members in attendance, when Keane reported back to the rest of the committee, she was overruled. \u201cI think they had benefited from the system, and they weren\u2019t keen to see it change,\u201d she says. Having publicly promised change, Keane felt unable to continue in her role as president. In a resignation email sent to the Footlights mailing list later that week, she wrote: \u201cI hope\u2026 I have proven how sincerely I believe the committee and voting system needs to change if we\u2019re ever going to have an inclusive comedy scene in Cambridge. In many ways it comes down to who is \u2018in\u2019 and who is \u2018out\u2019, and how incredibly hard it is to get \u2018in\u2019.\u201d She urged the committee members to consider supporting open auditions and open-mic nights. Keane\u2019s resignation made the national news. \u201cDiversity row at Cambridge Footlights as its president quits over lack of opportunities for non-white students,\u201d ran one Daily Mail headline, to a stream of furious reader comments accusing Keane of being a \u201csilly girl\u201d and \u201centitled little thing\u201d. Meanwhile, some members of the committee refused to acknowledge Keane\u2019s resignation as one of protest, alleging she was pushed out after a miscommunication resulted in Footlights being temporarily deregistered as a university club. (Keane says the allegation was \u201ca needless deflection of the issues at hand\u201d.) But her surprise resignation had a ripple effect. When the year ended, the committee members who had been against reform moved on, and the new committee went ahead and implemented everything Keane had promised. In 2019, for the first time in its 136-year history, Footlights is without a president, led, instead, by a democratically elected committee. \u201cIt\u2019s not that we\u2019ll never have a president again,\u201d says Amelia Hill, the current secretary. \u201cBut while the society remains in a transitional phase, this is the way we need to be organised.\u201d *** Close to midnight, in a snug venue at this year\u2019s Edinburgh festival fringe, Habib took to the stage alongside fellow Cambridge students Danny Baalbaki and Patrick Sylla. The trio call themselves the FootDarks (\u201cWe prefer alt-white,\u201d they joke in the blurb for their event) and are the first BME-only troupe of Footlights performers. \u201cWe are not the only two Muslims in Footlights. We are the only two Muslims in Cambridge,\u201d Habib jokes, as he introduces Baalbaki to the tightly squeezed-in audience. Their set is deliciously funny and challenging in the way it engages with race, class and privilege \u2013 politically pointed in a way that the main Footlights show, performed across the road in a more leisurely afternoon slot, is not. A few hours before the night\u2019s performance, I meet the three young men in the courtyard of a Hotel du Vin. Despite performing at the Edinburgh fringe, Baalbaki and Sylla tell me they still don\u2019t feel as if they belong here. It is a sense of alienation that was instilled, Baalbaki says, at school. \u201cI was sat down by my teacher and told: \u2018We saw you put Cambridge down as an option. You should take it out.\u2019\u201d Nobody at his school had received an Oxbridge offer before. \u201cThey said, \u2018If anyone\u2019s going to go there, it\u2019s not going to be you.\u2019\u201d \u201cSome teachers told me to lower my sights,\u201d says Sylla, who was also discouraged. \u201cI had a teacher who said, \u2018In the past, we wouldn\u2019t have suggested for certain kids to go to Oxbridge, because they\u2019ll have a hard time.\u2019 He meant black kids. I was like, \u2018You\u2019re an old white dude who is on my side, and even you think it\u2019s going to be hard for me.\u2019\u201d Messages like these teach a child, Sylla argues, that they do not have a right to exist in certain spaces. \u201cPeople who are privately educated come to Cambridge ready to perform comedy. They\u2019ve done plays, they\u2019ve done drama, they\u2019ve done theatre, they know how to put on a show. They\u2019ve grown up with a sense of belonging.\u201d For years, Footlights has earned a high proportion of its income by staging workshops and performances at private schools. A lack of exposure heightens the sense of alienation for minorities when auditioning for it, Baalbaki says. \u201cIf you come from a similar kind of school to those on the panel, you share a sensibility. You share cultural capital. So there\u2019s an instant divide.\u201d This year, as part of the swingeing changes to the way in which Footlights operates, the society visited state schools in Manchester, Chester, Essex, Croydon and Dorset to host workshops for less-advantaged pupils \u2013 the first time, in recent years at least, that the club has made a concerted effort to engage with institutions from which it would not turn a profit (the troupe performed ticketed events in each town, using the proceeds to pay for the school visits). \u201cWe taught some general acting for the younger kids, demonstrated what a pullback and reveal was,\u201d Hill explains. Many students, she says, have no understanding of the term \u201csketch comedy\u201d until they explain it is similar to the skits they see on YouTube or the website CollegeHumor. \u201cIt just gives them a little head start,\u201d she adds. While the society\u2019s 2018 crisis may seem like a closed chapter, the challenge now is to lock in change. \u201cWe are still very much at the beginning of a long journey to making the Footlights more accessible and open,\u201d Hunt says. As well as an increase in the number of BME-only comedy nights, Footlights now supports Stockings, comedy nights for women to try out jokes in a supportive environment. Footlights\u2019 membership system has been overhauled. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to set elected roles in stone to avoid nepotism in those future years when, for example, you have a lot of friends coming together,\u201d Hill says. \u201cWe can\u2019t guarantee it; we can only hope. But with so much fame and privilege behind this society, we should use that power for good.\u201d Not everyone is convinced of the usefulness of women- or BME-only nights, however. \u201cThe unforeseen negative effect of putting on special nights is that, if you give a certain demographic their special night, it can feel like you\u2019ve ticked the box, so there\u2019s no need for more profound change,\u201d says Wang, whose mother studied at Cambridge in the 70s and encouraged her son to apply. \u201cThe imperative is on Footlights to ensure they\u2019re diverse. Measures towards inclusion shouldn\u2019t wind up having the effect of segregation.\u201d It\u2019s an argument Sylla understands: \u201cIf people from ethnic minority backgrounds perform only at their shows, it creates separation,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I can\u2019t communicate the awkwardness of arriving somewhere and not understanding how to navigate the spaces. In my experience, these nights create a space where people who wouldn\u2019t otherwise feel comfortable are able to perform.\u201d The issues with which Footlights has been reckoning reflect those in the wider industry. \u201cFrom a purely comedic perspective, diversity of voices is just more interesting,\u201d Hunt says. She became so fed up in her first year of hearing similar jokes about middle-class \u201cquirks\u201d that she kept a tally of the times hummus was mentioned on stage. (It\u2019s a trend, Wang says, that extends beyond Cambridge: \u201cFor a while everybody seemed to have a hummus bit.\u201d) Hunt goes on: \u201cEndless pastiches of Monty Python and Mitchell and Webb are wearying. Diversity of membership means diversity of perspective. And diversity of perspective is the only thing, ultimately, that prevents comedy from becoming hackneyed.\u201d The complex issues of structural inequality, bias and class seen in Footlights also define the wider world of professional comedy. Some alumni are choosing to take up the fight here, on the wider stage. Having completed her studies at Cambridge, Keane, the first Footlights president to resign, has joined NextUp, a company that helps women and non-white comedians film their shows. Meanwhile, Habib has returned from the FootDarks run at Edinburgh with a diary full of meetings with agents. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting,\u201d he texts me, with the news. \u201cBut I have very few people to turn to for advice.\u201d \u2022 If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication). \u2022 This article was amended on 30 October 2019.

But when he was wondering what to do next, an intriguing opportunity emerged. Saul Isaksson-Hurst, a coach who used to work at Chelsea, got in touch and asked if Aarons fancied doing some one-to-one training. They hit it off and Aarons took a year away from traditional football, combining his solo sessions with Isaksson-Hurst with his school work. \u201cIt was taking my game to another level,\u201d he says. \u201cI felt sharper than doing any group training.\u201d</p> <p>Aarons does not know anyone who has done something similar.

Todd Cantwell, Ben Godfrey and Lewis are regulars in the first team.</p> <p>Norwich, who host Manchester United on Sunday afternoon, have not let go of the expansive style that enabled them to win the Championship last season.

It might not be long before Aarons, who admires Kyle Walker\u2019s game, is competing with Trent Alexander-Arnold and Aaron Wan-Bissaka for a place in the England side.

I had about six games there, which put me in really good stead.\u201d His father had contacted Gregg Broughton, who left Luton for Norwich\u2019s academy in 2014. \u201cI was on trial for three or four weeks before signing as a scholar,\u201d Aarons says. \u201cWhen I came here it almost felt like home because I knew a lot of the staff here and a lot of the players I played with at Luton who had come here with Gregg.\u201d Aarons looks around and marvels at Norwich\u2019s new academy complex, which was unveiled during the summer. When he first arrived there were portable buildings everywhere. There was certainly no 3G pitch. Progress has been rapid and Aarons is not the only graduate who has broken into the first team. Todd Cantwell, Ben Godfrey and Lewis are regulars in the first team. Norwich, who host Manchester United on Sunday afternoon, have not let go of the expansive style that enabled them to win the Championship last season. They did not lose faith with playing out from the back when they lost at Liverpool on the opening weekend. Yet they have not won since beating Manchester City at Carrow Road last month. Their defending was appalling in the recent 5-1 home defeat by Aston Villa and they are in the bottom three. Nonetheless, Aarons believes Daniel Farke is right to trust in his philosophy. \u201cThere were times last year where it wasn\u2019t going well, but we stuck to it and came up as champions,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re all learning but our main focus was not to sway from what got us here. That will be good in the long run.\u201d Aarons has made rapid progress since his debut in August 2018, earning a spot in the Championship team of the season. He is an England Under-21 international and was linked with United in the summer. Spurs are also likely to need a new right-back soon. There is no shortage of talented young English full-backs. It might not be long before Aarons, who admires Kyle Walker\u2019s game, is competing with Trent Alexander-Arnold and Aaron Wan-Bissaka for a place in the England side. He loves to attack and it is no surprise to hear he started out as a winger. \u201cYou need full-backs to deliver goals and assists and be defensively solid,\u201d he says. \u201cThe role now is tougher than ever but it has more rewards.\u201d Talk of England leads us to the abhorrent scenes in Bulgaria this month. Aarons was on under-21s duty and watched the game with Leicester\u2019s James Justin. He was shocked and angered when he witnessed the racist abuse from the Bulgarian crowd. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be happening in this day and age,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s disgusting. I couldn\u2019t believe what was going on.\u201d Aarons has a multicultural background. His father\u2019s parents came to Britain from Jamaica and he has relatives there. He is in touch with his roots and has not forgotten his early struggles. He speaks to Isaksson-Hurst on a regular basis and is determined not to let success change him. \u201cSometimes you do sit back and think: \u2018Wow,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s been a great 18 months but I need to carry it on. I want to stay level-headed.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "For over a decade attempts to build a monument to German unity have been hampered by technical problems, spiralling costs and huge disagreement over its purpose. The latest hurdle is a colony of 60 rare bats that took up residence in the pedestal of the planned 50-metre-long seesaw steel bowl, which will rock from side to side when people climb on to it. On the advice of nature conservationists, the Daubenton\u2019s bats \u2013 a Eurasian species recognisable by their small ears \u2013 will have to be rehoused near the planned site of the monument. Their careful removal and the construction of a new home for them are likely to further delay the monument and add considerably to the final costs of a project that is already hugely over budget and behind schedule. The budgetary committee of the Bundestag recently approved extra funding for the monument, bringing the costs up to \u20ac17m from an original sum of \u20ac10m. The decision to build the monument to freedom and unity was made by the Bundestag in 2007. It was supposed to be completed in time for the 30th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall next month, but there is now considerable doubt as to whether even a later date \u2013 3 October 2020, three decades after the reunification of East and West Germany took place \u2013 can be met. The bowl of the winning design, by the architects Milla &amp; Partner, is to be inscribed with the words, \u201cWir sind das Volk, wir sind ein Volk\u201d\u2013 we are the people, we are one people, echoing the rallying cry of demonstrators in former East Germany in the months leading up to the fall of the Wall. The appeal to move the bats came from the Nature Protection Association, Nabu, who took legal action in an attempt to halt the project. They argue that the Daubenton\u2019s bats, Myotis daubentonii, have turned the pedestal of the monument, on which the tilting bowl is supposed to sit, into both their summer and winter quarters. Once the bats have been removed, they advised that a tarpaulin should prevent them from re-entering the pedestal. As well as being found a new place to live, the bats will also require a suitable hunting ground. According to a report in the Tagesspiegel newspaper, conservationists are hoping some or all of a 600-metre stretch of the River Spree will be renaturated, at an estimated cost of more than \u20ac1m, to provide a new habitat and a sufficient supply of insects on which the bats can live. Milla &amp; Partner dispute that the bats are still in the pedestal, arguing that they have already moved to the wooded area of Pl\u00e4nterwald in the east of Berlin, driven out by the noise and artificial lighting at the memorial construction site.",

It looked for all measure like the ball had crossed the line after coming off the inside of the post and along Daniel Lopar\u2019s line - but was it the whole ball?</p> <p>The visitors dominated play - in midfield, in possession - but they couldn\u2019t find a knock out blow. Milos Ninkovic hitting the crossbar early on, while Kosta Barbarouses spurned at least two gild-edged chances to notch the winner.</p> <p>A brilliant rearguard effort from the Wanderers marshalled expertly by Matthew Jurman. And a stoinking goal to decide it - go find a look at Mitchell Duke\u2019s headed winner - it was a thing of beauty.</p> <p>A terrific exhibition of Australian football, and nearly 30,000 fans going home, if not very happy, but at least hugely entertained.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5db422368f0898437061c349\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-26T10:40:36.104Z\">11.40am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>\u201cWe dominated the whole game.

That said, I was up and out at 7.45am to take my eldest boy to his cricket game. His team\u2019s result first: they won their fourth straight game and my son opened the batting, hitting two fours in the first over before being run out in a hilarious display of running between the wickets that you would, well, sort of expect from 10-year-olds. </p> <p>Now, the WBBL result: Adelaide Strikers have brought the Hurricanes back down to earth with a hard-fought three-run win.</p> <p>This, from the kind people at Australia Associated Press:</p> <p>\u201cThe Adelaide Strikers have snapped Hobart\u2019s winning start to the WBBL season after holding on for a three-run win over the Hurricanes at Allan Border Field. After being restricted to 8-113 from their 20 overs, the Strikers were firmly on the back foot in the field, particularly while Hobart\u2019s Nicola Carey (39) was at the crease. But some tight bowling on a challenging deck in the closing four overs stalled the Hurricanes\u2019 charge, which ended at 7-110.</p> <p>After the asking rate had dipped below a run a ball, the \u2018Canes suddenly required 11 off the last over, bowled by Sophie Devine. With five needed off two balls, Carey creamed Devine powerfully to cow corner but straight down the throat of Katie Mack, centimetres inside the rope, before Maisy Gibson could only muster a single off the last delivery.</p> <p>Amanda Wellington (2-18), Tahlia McGrath (1-12) and Megan Schutt (1-13) bowled superbly for the Strikers, who had looked out of the running when Schutt and Sarah Coyte dropped absolute sitters in the fifth over.<br></p> <p>Earlier, two desperately close run-outs and a plethora of soft, spooned dismissals sabotaged the Strikers\u2019 innings before Coyte\u2019s lusty 24 off 13 balls from No.9 with the bat, lifted them from an inadequate total to one that proved competitive. Gibson (2-15), Tayla Vlaeminck (2-18) and Carey (2-25) were the pick of the bowlers for the Hurricanes.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5db26e018f0804be7279b896\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/scott-heinrich\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-26T04:07:51.611Z\">5.07am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Preamble</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Good afternoon, sports fans.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s one of the pedigree fixtures of the season, and after much handwringing over the demise of Australia\u2019s domestic football competition it\u2019s fair to say, the A-League is back, baby. A sold out Parramatta Stadium, a pulsating atmosphere for 90 minutes - and a derby win for the Wanderers, albeit by the finest of margins. Sydney FC\u2019s Steve Corica was an unhappy man after his side appeared to score a goal that wasn\u2019t awarded. It looked for all measure like the ball had crossed the line after coming off the inside of the post and along Daniel Lopar\u2019s line - but was it the whole ball? The visitors dominated play - in midfield, in possession - but they couldn\u2019t find a knock out blow. Milos Ninkovic hitting the crossbar early on, while Kosta Barbarouses spurned at least two gild-edged chances to notch the winner. A brilliant rearguard effort from the Wanderers marshalled expertly by Matthew Jurman. And a stoinking goal to decide it - go find a look at Mitchell Duke\u2019s headed winner - it was a thing of beauty. A terrific exhibition of Australian football, and nearly 30,000 fans going home, if not very happy, but at least hugely entertained. \u201cWe dominated the whole game. I\u2019m very proud of how we played, I\u2019m disappointed we didn\u2019t score.\u201d \u201cMy opinion, it went over the line - we could have had a penalty too. They\u2019ve got the technology to make sure they got it right, let\u2019s hope they got it right.\u201d That\u2019s the word from Sydney FC\u2019s head coach, Steve Corica. Still a little aggrieved, but to be expected given the atmosphere. Sydney FC with 68% possession, but just four shots on target for their 20 attempts. \u201cWe were a little fortunate, but look - we are a young side and we have to take our luck and believe in ourselves.\u201d It\u2019s a relieved Marcus Babbel post-game. But he sees his side remain the only perfect-record side in the league: three games played, three games won. Top of the table. It\u2019s a relieved skipper and match-winning Mitch Duke who chat\u2019s post-game. \u201cThese derby matches are all about one key moment and lucky enough we took it.\u201d His bullet header really was something special - a goal worthy of winning any game, let alone a derby. It\u2019s been a looooong time coming - but in the return to the new-look Parramatta Stadium, it\u2019s the Wanderers who emerge on top! Almost 1,000 days since their last derby win. What an atmosphere - what a night. Terrific stuff. 90 + 4 min: They\u2019ve got about seven players in a line up front, Sydney FC - a lumped ball into the box falls to a man in a blue shirt - would you believe it\u2019s Ninkovic, free - but he\u2019s blocked!! Terrific recovery from his former teammate, Jurman. Has he just saved the three points for his new club? 90 + 3 min: Sydney look to force the play, what can they come up with. The Wanderers fans start to whistle for full-time, but we\u2019ve still got a few minutes to run. 90 + 1 min: Ach. It\u2019s a nasty clash of heads - and it\u2019s the two brothers McGowan, and they\u2019re both laid out flat. They eventually get back to their feet, Ryan a little more groggily. He\u2019s staying forward as a makeshift striker, and looking to cause some havoc in the box. 89 min: Ninkovic tries a shot - it deflects and falls almost to Adam Le Fondre, who tries the spectacular bicycle kick! But it sails high. 18 shots to five is the official tally. It really has been all Sydney FC this second half. Four minutes is the added time. And a fair turnout, as the official crowd figure for tonight is confirmed: 85 min: And that\u2019s Luke Brattan in the book for Sydney FC. It\u2019s beginning to feel like it\u2019s not going to be their night, the Sky Blues. It feels a long time between drinks for derby wins for the Wanderers - could it be tonight? And the big news from the Rugby World Cup - the defending champions, chasing a three-peat, the all-conquering All Blacks are out. What a terrific performance from Eddie Jones\u2019 England: 81 min: And there\u2019s the Poznan! Back at Parramatta Stadium, and what a treat to see. The RBB raise the decibel level once again. What an evening this has been - and what a breath of fresh air, in a league that some were saying had got a little stale. Stadiums custom-made for football, with sold out crowds, full of highly engaged fans. What more do you want? 79 min: Another talking point as Retre collapses in a heap inside the box. He was rising for a header, but Baccus burrows under the left back, and he lands heavily. No suggestion of a penalty - and Corica is again raging on the touchline! It\u2019s not his night, the Sydney FC coach - expect some words after full-time. 77 min: It\u2019s one-way traffic here, but that won\u2019t faze Marcus Babbel too much, as long as his side hold on. Sydney are probing and testing, but they still haven\u2019t found a way past Lopar. What a big call that was from Babbel to tear up the long-term contract of Vedran Janjetovic and bring in a visa-spot \u2018keeper. But you\u2019d have to say it\u2019s paid off handsomely. 74 min: They\u2019re funnelling deep, Western Sydney, but they\u2019ve not been unduly put under pressure, yet. That said, Ninkovic slides a perfect ball for Barbarouses, and he\u2019s one-on-one through with the \u2018keeper - but Lopar denies him! Great save with the outstretched left leg. That should have been the equaliser! 72 min: That\u2019s the end of the shift for Baumjohann, who gets the jeers from his old fans. It\u2019s Anthony Caceres who takes his place for Sydney FC. 68 min: A terrific intervention from Schwegler - he\u2019s been everywhere tonight, the Wanderers holding midfielder, as he slides in to cut out a dangerous cross from Grant. Le Fondre then looks to bend one, but he leans back and it flies a little high. 65 min: A fine whipped cross across the face from Duke, but there\u2019s no Wanderers arriving to tap home. They\u2019re finding great joy on the fast transition - imagine if they\u2019d made it two! 63 min: Barbarouses looks to fire a fast break for Sydney FC, but it\u2019s won back by Duke. Baumjohann wins a corner - they\u2019re still pushing, the Sky Blues. Can they find the goal though? 59 min: A slight lull in proceedings after the real burst of venom. Incredible that we don\u2019t have a definitive answer on the Sydney FC goal/non-goal yet. A case for goal-line technology independent of VAR perhaps? 57 min: Grant concedes a corner, trying to chest back to his \u2018keeper but it goes into touch. Meier with a near-post flick, but it flies past the near post, and doesn\u2019t trouble Andrew Redmayne. 54 min: This game is bubbling now - Grant gets a talking to from the referee. The crowd\u2019s getting involved, Schwegler\u2019s in the mix of it again. Schwegler and Grant have a coming together - and Corica gets imbroiled in the touchline melee as well! Fiery stuff. A yellow card to both Grant and Schwegler. Seemingly no punishment, yet for Corica. 51 min: Post! My, oh my. What a charmed life this Wanderers\u2019 goal is leading! It\u2019s Barbarouses\u2019s header that comes off the inside of the post - has that crossed the line? The TV replays suggest it has - and yet VAR has dismissed the claims. Steve Corica is blowing up. Surely there has to be a definitive answer from the video men - from the naked eye it looked a goal! 50 min: Sydney FC look to get their passing game going in midfield, and they\u2019ve earned a corner off Baccus. What can O\u2019Neill make from this? 48 min: An injury concern for Sullivan, who is down with a potential groin issue. It could be an early chance for the Wanderers. And he does make way - it\u2019s the teenager Mohamed Adam who comes on in his place. Kick-off - second half: Sydney derby! 45 min: We\u2019re back, and let\u2019s see what this second stanza brings. Wanderers coach Babbel tells the commentary team his side needs to defend better as a collective - let\u2019s see if there\u2019s a little sting in Western Sydney\u2019s first few minutes. But! Back to our feature match - from the A-League, and a new-look Parramatta Stadium where there\u2019s a sell-out crowd for the first Sydney derby of 2019-20. Second half is just about to get underway. And from the Rugby Union World Cup, an horrific error from the lineout has given the All Blacks their first foothold in the game. It\u2019s been imperious from England so far - but have they just let the foxes into the henhouse? And a pretty impressive result from the rugby league - Tonga putting on a masterclass against a combined Great Britain team. John Davidson is our eyes at the stadium for that one: And a between-innings update from the WBBL - a flurry of late wickets and the scoring slows a little towards the end - they notch 8-132 (20) Sydney Thunder. Will it be enough? Plenty of starts but no big scores to bring it home - Rachel Hayne\u2019s 36 off 33 the pick with the bat. Maitlin Brown and Sophie Molineux with three wickets each for the Renegades. 45 min: Another chance, Sydney FC! It\u2019s a tough tackle in midfield that releases Le Fondre, but Lopar races off his line to clear! A fast finish to the half, they\u2019ve got stronger and stronger Sydney FC, and yet they still trail. A pulsating first forty-five, the second stanza will only be better, you\u2019d imagine. What an atmosphere - exactly what the A-League needs. 42 min: It\u2019s blocked by the wall. But from the following play they\u2019ve clattered the post, Sydney FC! It might have been scratched off for offside anyway, but what a letoff for the Wanderers. They\u2019re on the back foot here. 41 min: Baccus in the book for a clumsy barge in the back against Baumjohann. And here\u2019s a fine shooting chance from a good position just outside the box - and guess, who - it\u2019s the German, Baumjohann who\u2019s over it. Wouldn\u2019t this be a storyline. 39 min: Nice feet from Bacchus as Wanderers open up the play, but they can\u2019t find the final crossed delivery. Sydney with some slick short-passing between their small, clever forward line. But it ends with a shot wide from Barbarouses from outside the box. Lopar won\u2019t mind that - it didn\u2019t look too threatening in the end. 37 min: O\u2019Neill with a placed shot from outside the box, but it\u2019s blocked. They\u2019ve shuffled well, the Wanderers backline - Matt Jurman and Dylan McGowan more or less getting it down. We\u2019ve seen little of Le Fondre so far. But he only ever needs half a sniff, the English poacher. 35 min: Brilliant ball in from Schwegler and Duke tries to glance it goalwards - but it\u2019s too faint! It deflects behind for a corner. And for all their huffing and puffing, Sydney FC, it\u2019s Wanderers who have created the two best chances - both almost against the run of play. 33 min: Schwegler penalised for a foul on Ninkovic. He\u2019ll have to watch himself, the Wanderers holder, he\u2019s already been fortunate to avoid a booking for an earlier professional foul. Sydney FC deliver the set piece well, and it\u2019s Ryan McGowan arriving for the header - but it flies over the crossbar! 30 min: Kosta Barbarouses tries to pin the ears and take on the teenager Wilmering. He looks for a ball inside to Ninkovic, and finds him - it\u2019s a first-time poked effort - saved! Great combination. And seconds later it\u2019s Barbarouses - but he drags the shot wide! Ninkovic is pulling the strings out there - terrific lead-up work by the former Johnny Warren medallist. 26 min: Another cross in, and again it\u2019s a late-arriving Mitchell Duke, but that one just evades the Wanderers\u2019 skipper. Warning signs for Steve Corica - Paulo Retre\u2019s not a natural left back and Georgievski\u2019s enjoying himself down the right flank. 24 min: Alexander Baumjohann tries one from a long way out - but it doesn\u2019t bend back round. To the delight of the home fans in the \u201csafe standing zone\u201d behind that goal. Gee, they\u2019re making some din, the RBB. 21 min: And a bit of a dust-up! Sullivan and McGowan come together and the referee hands them both yellow cards. The youngster will have to be careful - he\u2019s only three games into his A-League career, they can\u2019t afford 70 minutes with 10. Very little in that, to be honest - the Sydney FC defender pushed the youngster so he could get a freekick taken quickly. Put that all down to this intense atmosphere - drums, chantings, clapping. It\u2019s terrific to see in the A-League. 18 min: Hello. On the transition, it\u2019s a fast break from Wanderers after Retre gives it away cheaply - it\u2019s a fine cross from Georgievski and what a thumping header from Duke! He\u2019s come from deep, and that\u2019s smacked the back of the net. He\u2019s got a head like a traction engine! Brilliant headed goal. 15 min: Sydney FC enjoying a good patch here, as Lopar is again forced into a save. It\u2019s all coming down the right-hand side of Grant and Baumjohann. And it\u2019s Le Fondre with a flicked header, but it\u2019s kept out well by the Wanderers\u2019 \u2018keeper. 13 min: Crossbar! A terrific ball from O\u2019Neill over the top of the defence to find Milos Ninkovic - he gets a faint touch to knock it past the outrushing Lopar, but gets too much on it, and it clatters back off the crossbar, to the relief of the Wanderers\u2019 Swiss shot-stopper. 10 min: Ninkovic and Georgievski tussle for the ball - watch that space, if anyone\u2019s bound to get \u201clively\u201d in a derby setting it could be our Daniel. Doesn\u2019t mind a two-footer. Grant with a shot, but he\u2019s sliced that badly and it loops harmlessly over Lopar\u2019s bar. 8 min: Yeboah looks to push Retre into an early error, but the FC fullback clears well. Marcus Babbel is prowling the touchline in his now customary \u201cPeaky Blinders\u201d look. Terrific noise inside the stadium, but very much a \u201cfeeling each other out\u201d phase to this one so far. 5 min: Wanderers with the early possession, passing it round the back. Sydney FC now with it as O\u2019Neill rakes a splendid pass out to Grant, who earns Sydney\u2019s first corner. 3 min: Don\u2019t forget, there\u2019s also the subplot of Alexander Baumjohann lining up for Sydney FC - he had some parting shots about Wanderers\u2019 lack of ambition when he left, let\u2019s see if he comes in for any special attention. And of course, Matt Jurman - a six-season Sydney FC player - lining up in the heart of defence for the Wanderers. A-League, Sydney Derby - kick off! 1 min: And we\u2019re off! What a crowd, what an atmosphere, what a build up. Now to see if the football can match. A reminder, the Rugby World Cup semi-final between England and New Zealand is currently underway. And with 25 minutes gone it\u2019s looking pretty bright for the northern hemisphere side. Lee Calvert is our eyes and ears there: They\u2019re one v two on the A-League ladder - it\u2019s been a tough few years for the giants of Western Sydney, who have had a tough time in exile. Let\u2019s not mention the ghoulish Spotless Stadium. But the atmosphere inside Parramatta Stadium is absolutely heaving. It\u2019s a sold-out capacity crowd - our players are in the tunnel. The 23rd Sydney derby is just minutes away! And a quick score check in the WBBL - Sydney Thunder are 1-52 off six, so still scoring at a fair clip, despite that slow first over. The innings is building nicely - could be a fair first tally to chase for the Renegades. To team news: Just the one change for the Wanderers as Kwame Yeboah replaces Mo Adam, who drops to the bench. Don\u2019t be fooled by the graphic, it will be a 4-3-3 from Marcus Babbel, with Schwegler the sole holder, and Sullivan and Baccus pushing on to Sydney\u2019s two sitting midfielders. It worked a treat last week against the Victory - will it do the job in the derby? And for Sydney FC there\u2019s still no Michael Zullo at left back, so Paulo Retre gets the nod to deputise there again, ahead of the youngster Joel King. Brothers Dylan and Ryan McGowan face off against each other. Would you believe when they moved back to Australia they bought houses next to each other. Hopefully no fence wars start up following this match. So - let\u2019s turn our attention to the Sydney derby. They\u2019re always pretty special, but there just seems to be a little bit more about this fixture. So great to see the RBB marching through Parramatta earlier in the day - three years they\u2019ve waited for that, the Wanderers fans, let\u2019s hope their team can put a performance for them. And if you missed the earlier headline from the WBBL - here\u2019s the write up on the Marizanne Kapp show: Meanwhile Rachel Priest has just gone BANG on Sophie Molineaux\u2019s first over - 4,4,6 - but falls on the last delivery! 14 off the over but a wicket? I guess you\u2019d take it if you\u2019re the Renegades. And we\u2019re underway in our fourth and final WBBL fixture of the day, where the Melbourne Renegades have won the toss and put the Thunder in to bat first. Tidy first over from Lea Tahuhu, just the one off it. It\u2019s a first win in the A-League for Reds coach Gertjan Verbeek - what a week the club has had, just days after it secured back-to-back FFA Cup trophies. Three points, and they\u2019ve earned their rest for next week\u2019s bye. A frustrating day for the Jets, it\u2019s never nice to lose at home, especially after dominating early on - especially to a \u2018keeping error from the experienced Glen Moss. A-League - 90 + 3 mins: Newcastle Jets 1-2 Adelaide United Oh my! It\u2019s the skipper Boogaard with a stooping, diving header across the face - but there\u2019s no teammate on hand to bundle it home! Nobody anticipated the defender\u2019s dexterity there. A real chance for the leveller. A-League - 90 + 1 mins: Newcastle Jets 1-2 Adelaide United Five minutes added on is the verdict from the touchline. Petratos, Dimi, looks to fire a set piece into the box, but Boogaard is pinged for a foul on an Adelaide defender. They\u2019re huffing and puffing, the Jets, but can they blow the door down? A-League - 87 mins: Newcastle Jets 1-2 Adelaide United Ooph. Maria with a clearance from under the crossbar, they are starting to besiege the Adelaide goal, the home side. Can they fashion a decisive shot though? Outside of that superb Arroyo goal it\u2019s been the story of the match for the Jets. As Paul Keating would say - all tip, and no iceberg. A-League - 83 mins: Newcastle Jets 1-2 Adelaide United It\u2019s an A-League debut for Makis Petratos - incredibly the fourth Petratos sibling on the books at the Jets. They\u2019re like the Fowlers - Mary, Quivi, Ciari and co - what great footballing dynasties we\u2019re enjoying. Newcastle still struggling to break down this obdurate Reds defence, as brother Dimi tries to twist and turn inside the box. A-League - 78 mins: Newcastle Jets 1-2 Adelaide United What can Merrick\u2019s men muster here - they\u2019re running out of time, about 15 min to play up in Newcastle. The home side have a corner but it\u2019s cleared twice by Adelaide\u2019s central defensive duo of Marrone and Jakobsen. Hi all! Cheers Scott, sounds like a good bex and a lie down is in order - a sterling effort as always. We\u2019re T-minus ONE HOUR for the Sydney derby. A first back at the refurbished Parramatta Stadium, and with the Wanderers resurgent early in the season, it also doubles as a top-of-the-table clash. Should be an absolute corker. In the interim, we\u2019ll try and keep an eye across Newcastle v Adelaide, and there will be some more WBBL shortly. Like the three-headed hound of Hades, it never sleeps, Sportwatch. Well, folks, that is all from me. You\u2019ve worn me out, but I like it like that. Now you can mete out a dose of mental disintegration in the direction of Richard Parkin. Over to you, Parko! A-League: GOAL! Newcastle Jets 1-2 Adelaide United (McGree, 61 mins) That goal from McGree has seen Newcastle retreat into their shell and this second goal was most definitely coming. Moss, the Jets keeper, has a bit of a nightmare judging McGree\u2019s corner in the blustery conditions, allowing the ball to sail over him and into the goal at the far post. It is all Adelaide in this second half. A-League: 56 mins: Newcastle Jets 1-1 Adelaide United Man down. Izzo is on his back receiving treatment for a heavy knock. Substitute keeper Richards springs to life like my ageing staffy Ted when I open the fridge door, but Izzo carries on. He\u2019ll have a headache tomorrow, though. A-League: GOAL! Newcastle Jets 1-1 Adelaide United (McGree, 49 mins) Sloppy is one word for Newcastle\u2019s defending here. Atrocious is another. They were just so casual at the back, allowing Troisi to put it on a plate for McGree, who stabs it past the keeper from six or so yards to restore parity. A-League: 47 mins: Newcastle Jets 1-0 Adelaide United A yellow card for D\u2019Arrigo and a richly deserved one at that after somewhat cynically brings down Fitzgerald. Commentating for Fox Sports, Andy Harper calls for a penalty \u201csomewhere between a yellow and a red\u201d for such a brazen indiscretion. Not sure what that would be, but it\u2019s interesting nonetheless. A-League: 46 mins: Newcastle Jets 1-0 Adelaide United Adelaide go for broke at the earliest opportunity, and address some obvious issues, by making a double change at half-time - Opseth off for Mileusnic, and Kitto off for Maria. The lead-up to the gargantuan Rugby World Cup semi-final between New Zealand and England has begun. Too early isn\u2019t early enough to start a liveblog when it\u2019s a match-up like this. Go on, click on the link below. A-League: HT: Newcastle Jets 1-0 Adelaide United Well, it wasn\u2019t always pretty but an isolated bit of brilliance from Arroyo separates these teams at the break. The play has mostly belonged to the Jets, with 12 shots to four telling the story. The FFA Cup winners have lots to do if they\u2019re to salvage anything from this match. A-League: GOAL! Newcastle Jets 1-0 Adelaide United (Arroyo, 37 mins) A real striker\u2019s goal from the Panamanian and a nice way to open his Jets account. A long, long throw from Millar finds the chest of Arroyo, who brings the ball down in the box, swivels and volleys past Izzo to make it 1-0. Pretty to watch. A-League: 34 mins: Newcastle Jets 0-0 Adelaide United Adelaide\u2019s best chance of the match by far and probably a better one than McGree figured at the time, having been released by Opseth but getting very little on his shot inside the box. A-League: 28 mins: Newcastle Jets 0-0 Adelaide United This match, a little tepid to this point, bares its fangs with Troisi hacking down Ridenton to attract a yellow card on his Reds debut. We\u2019re still without a goal, however, and one hasn\u2019t really looked like coming after that Jets chance in the opening 20 seconds of the match. A-League: 15 mins: Newcastle Jets 0-0 Adelaide United A rather cagey opening to this match with neither side really exerting any dominance, Newcastle\u2019s near miss in the opening seconds notwithstanding. The windy conditions don\u2019t look to be helping. Toure showing good pace and control down the left for Adelaide to force a corner. Adelaide Strikers (113-8) beat Hobart Hurricanes (110-7) by three runs. Player of the match: Sarah Coyte (24 runs, one catch, 1-28) Sydney Sixers (108-2) beat Melbourne Stars (107-9) by eight wickets with 17 balls remaining, Player of the match: Marizanne Kapp (3-16 ... and a hat-trick!) Perth Scorchers (147-1) beat Brisbane Heat (146-7) by nine wickets with 10 balls remaining. Player of the match: Amy Jones (60 not out off 49 balls) A-League: 1 min: Newcastle Jets 0-0 Adelaide United Barely 20 seconds in and a genuine chance for the Jets goes by the wayside, Koutroumbis producing the cross but Hoffman unable to finish the job. Over to McDonald Jones Stadium for a taste of A-League action between winless teams Newcastle and Adelaide. It\u2019s windy there, too. The start is not far away. Newcastle (4-2-3-1): Moss (GK); Koutroumbis, Topor-Stanley, Boogaard, Millar; Ridenton, Ugarkovic; Fitzgerald, D Petratos, Hoffman; Arroyo. Subs: Italiano (GK), Thurgate, Langlois, Y Petratos, Kantarovski, Burns, Jackson. Adelaide (4-3-3): Izzo (GK); Kitto, Jakobsen, Marrone, Strain; Troisi, McGree, D\u2019Arrigo; Toure, Opseth, Halloran. Subs: Richards (GK), Maria, Mileusnic, Lia, Konstandopoulos, Brook. Back to the BBL ... In Sydney, on the back of a hat-trick to Marizanne Kapp, Sydney Sixers have strolled to an easy eight-wicket win over Melbourne Stars. Having held the Stars to 107-9, the Sixers always looked likely with opener and skipper Ellyse Perry hitting an unbeaten 39. In Brisbane, Meg Lanning and Amy Jones put on 129 for the first wicket to put Perth Scorchers within touching distance of Brisbane Heat\u2019s 146-7. The visitors have four overs with which to score the remaining 17 runs for victory. Game 3 of the World Series is done and dusted. And, thankfully for the sake of the series, the Astros have found some form, beating the Nationals 4-1 to cut their deficit in the best-of-seven extravaganza to 2-1. Here\u2019s the minutiae. Seriously, is there anything Sam Kerr can\u2019t do? Please don\u2019t respond by listing all the the things she can\u2019t do. It\u2019s a rhetorical question. Don\u2019t know where you are, but where I am it\u2019s frightfully windy today. It\u2019s also blowing a gale at Phillip Island, where Saturday\u2019s qualifying sessions in the Australian MotoGP have been put off until tomorrow. This, again, from AAP: \u201cSaturday\u2019s qualifying sessions for the Australian MotoGP have been postponed until Sunday, with the windswept Phillip Island circuit deemed unsafe by riders. Fourth practice was red-flagged soon after Miguel Oliveira suffered a scary high-speed crash on his Red Bull KTM Tech 3. As the Portuguese rider was taken to the medical centre, a safety commission meeting was convened and the 21 remaining riders voted to abandon racing for the rest of the day.\u201d It\u2019s time to head around the grounds in the WBBL (well, we have to justify the expense of sending our intrepid reporters to these locales somehow): Melbourne Stars totalled a thin-looking 107-9 in Sydney, with Mignon du Preez\u2019s 44 off 47 balls the only thing to get remotely excited about. In response, Sydney Sixers are 16-0 after three overs with the mighty opening pair of Ellyse Perry and Alyssa Healy yet to be separated. And hats off to Sixers seamer Marizanne Kapp, who only went and took a late-innings HAT-TRICK to wrap up the Stars\u2019 dig. In Brisbane, Beth Mooney clobbered 67 off 55 balls (putting on 70 for the third wicket with Maddy Green) as Brisbane Heat posted 146-7. In reply, Perth Scorchers are 5-0 in the second over. The world is a large place, and our good friends in the United States are rather keen on their sport(s), too. If what\u2019s going down on these pages isn\u2019t enough for you, which of course it is, why don\u2019t you mosey on over to Hunter Felt\u2019s blow-by-blow description of game three of the World Series. And then hurry right back, okay? An early game\u2019s a good game, and my did the WBBL shenanigans start early in Brisbane this morning. That said, I was up and out at 7.45am to take my eldest boy to his cricket game. His team\u2019s result first: they won their fourth straight game and my son opened the batting, hitting two fours in the first over before being run out in a hilarious display of running between the wickets that you would, well, sort of expect from 10-year-olds. Now, the WBBL result: Adelaide Strikers have brought the Hurricanes back down to earth with a hard-fought three-run win. This, from the kind people at Australia Associated Press: \u201cThe Adelaide Strikers have snapped Hobart\u2019s winning start to the WBBL season after holding on for a three-run win over the Hurricanes at Allan Border Field. After being restricted to 8-113 from their 20 overs, the Strikers were firmly on the back foot in the field, particularly while Hobart\u2019s Nicola Carey (39) was at the crease. But some tight bowling on a challenging deck in the closing four overs stalled the Hurricanes\u2019 charge, which ended at 7-110. After the asking rate had dipped below a run a ball, the \u2018Canes suddenly required 11 off the last over, bowled by Sophie Devine. With five needed off two balls, Carey creamed Devine powerfully to cow corner but straight down the throat of Katie Mack, centimetres inside the rope, before Maisy Gibson could only muster a single off the last delivery. Amanda Wellington (2-18), Tahlia McGrath (1-12) and Megan Schutt (1-13) bowled superbly for the Strikers, who had looked out of the running when Schutt and Sarah Coyte dropped absolute sitters in the fifth over. Earlier, two desperately close run-outs and a plethora of soft, spooned dismissals sabotaged the Strikers\u2019 innings before Coyte\u2019s lusty 24 off 13 balls from No.9 with the bat, lifted them from an inadequate total to one that proved competitive. Gibson (2-15), Tayla Vlaeminck (2-18) and Carey (2-25) were the pick of the bowlers for the Hurricanes.\u201d Good afternoon, sports fans. It\u2019s a good day to be alive, isn\u2019t it? Season five of the WBBL continues with three games, two A-League fixtures will be decided (highlighted by this evening\u2019s mouthwatering Sydney derby) and it\u2019s qualifying time at the Australian MotoGP. But all of that takes a back seat to the sheer wonder of tonight\u2019s Rugby World Cup semi-final between New Zealand and England. That really will be one for the ages. Best of all, the good folk at Guardian Towers will bring you all the updates. Right here. So don\u2019t be going anywhere, ya hear?

The government\u2019s flood information service has 13 warnings where \u201cimmediate action is required\u201d across Yorkshire, the Midlands and Wales on Saturday. There are four Met Office weather warnings in place for rain, covering parts of Wales as well as northern and south-western parts of England. Early on Saturday morning, Devon and Somerset fire and rescue service said crews had been sent to help motorists who had driven into flood water. It said on Twitter that large volumes of flood water in north Devon were making driving conditions hazardous, adding that officers had attended to \u201ca number of people who have driven into floodwater\u201d. The service said: \u201cDrivers are asked to respect road closures, not diverting to minor roads which are more treacherous. Avoid travel.\u201d Fire crews were called to homes in the market town of Wem and Market Drayton in Shropshire after water was threatening electrical systems. West Mercia and Shrewsbury police said many rural roads were under water, while South Worcestershire police said officers had rescued three people from a car in flood water in Green Lane, Droitwich. Humberside police said a number of roads were impassable because of flooding and urged drivers to avoid the area around the B1246 at Warter. As much as 120mm of rain could fall in parts of Wales with the Met Office warning fast-flowing flood water was \u201clikely\u201d in the area which could cause a \u201cdanger to life\u201d. Libanus in south Wales has had 93mm of rainfall in the past 24 hours. In Nuneaton, Warwickshire, fire crews said conditions were \u201cvery hazardous\u201d with several incidents across the county of people \u201cmarooned in flood water\u201d. The showers have also resulted in travel disruption and events being cancelled, particularly in the Midlands, Greater Manchester and Wales. Several rail lines in and out of Shrewsbury have been affected and replacement buses are being used. There are also reports of problems on some major roads including the A49, A53 and A442. Stockport council said it had closed the A555 between the oil terminal and the A34 junction at Handforth Dean in both directions. Transport for Wales said lines from Shrewsbury to Welshpool, Wrexham and Crewe were closed with rail replacement buses requested. In a statement, the rail operator told the BBC: \u201cCustomers travelling on these routes should not to travel unless absolute necessary. Road transport is extremely limited and there are reports of issues on the roads.\u201d Heavy rain also flooded the railway through Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, with National Rail stating that the disruption would last until the end of the day. Transport for Wales said severe rail service delays had been reported between Shrewsbury, Wolverhampton and Birmingham and no replacement road transport was available. In Derbyshire, the Matlock Bath Illuminations was cancelled because the river Derwent has flooded, while Nottingham Forest football club called off its match in the Championship against Reading as the pitch was in an \u201cunplayable condition\u201d. Meanwhile, a burst of \u201cpolar maritime air\u201d is also expected to bring colder temperatures to northern parts of the UK on Saturday before hitting the rest of the country on Sunday and into next week. This is expected to bring colder weather with the first widespread frost of the season anticipated over the weekend as well as a dusting of snow on higher ground.",

Dressed in a black Vivienne Westwood number, silver choker and towering tartan platform boots, she is sporting a panoply of piercings, her hair pulled into braids. It is a contrast with previous looks: specs and baggy basketball sweats, a full nu-metal uniform (Slipknot tee, studded wristbands) and even a mermaid phase, during which she called herself Wavy Spice. To call Frasqueri a shapeshifter would be an understatement. </p> <p>Although known mostly as a rapper, over her career she has mined everything from emo and punk to ballroom, folk and lo-fi house. Today she declares herself a \u201clittle hippy stoner\u201d and \u201can old soul\u201d, \u201chonest, normal and lovely\u201d and \u201cvery intelligent\u201d.

Not in front of me. I\u2019m not a docile, complacent person when it comes to racial aggressions.\u201d Later in the verse, she likens herself to a female Colin Kaepernick. \u201cThat was a metaphor about me standing for what I believe in.

An NYC native of Puerto Rican descent, she was raised in Harlem until the age of 10, when her mother died from an Aids-related illness. The grieving pre-teen was shunted into various foster homes, one of which she has previously described as physically abusive, before running away to live with her grandmother in the Lower East Side when she was 15. She started songwriting when she was 12. \u201cI was a happy-go-lucky gothic girl who had an optimistic spirit cos I was suffering a lot at home,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019d been suffering all of my life. I think comedians and artists, we do that. We know how to be the life of the party and enjoy exuberance outside of pain.\u201d</p> <p>When Frasqueri dropped her first single on SoundCloud in 2010, fans were drawn to a savvy artist who could flip from utter irreverence (Bitch I\u2019m Posh) to shrewd commentary on colonial history (Yaya). For her new record, she is trying something new: due next year it was recorded between Puerto Rico, Los Angeles and New York, and saw her work with jazz musicians, freestyling and sometimes creating as many as 10 songs in three hours.</p> <p>According to Frasqueri, one of the record\u2019s producers has compared her creative output to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/aug/15/joni-mitchells-albums-ranked\">Joni Mitchell</a>. \u201cHe said: \u2018You\u2019re emotional and you\u2019re powerful and you\u2019re this really witchy woman.

As we segue from the themes in her single to wider topics to do with society, such as whether the US has regressed since 2017, she seems unwilling to talk. \u201cTo be honest with you, I\u2019m really trying to make my articles centred around music solely,\u201d she says firmly. \u201cA lot of journalists like to ask a lot of questions that are very non sequitur to the topic at hand. I don\u2019t want to go into public zeitgeist because I don\u2019t do press a lot and I\u2019m allowing you to do this and ask me questions and I\u2019m very intelligent so I talk a lot but I can\u2019t go into worldly issues. This is about Princess Nokia music.\u201d</p> <p>She is similarly reluctant to discuss the clear ballroom influences in her single\u2019s video; in this instance she is wary about being seen as a spokesperson for an important part of the LGBTQ community. \u201cBallroom is a tricky topic that I\u2019m not going to bring up. People want to latch on to it because it\u2019s very popular right now. I don\u2019t want to be a spokesperson for it because once I say I vogued in high school, people want to latch on to that, and they don\u2019t want to latch on to other things that are more important.\u201d She stops for a breath. \u201cI just have to be very adamant on these things.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"58c57fe4ef2d60aa6b91c8b3e1bf763d052dfe19\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/58c57fe4ef2d60aa6b91c8b3e1bf763d052dfe19/0_149_4511_2706/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lean, mean...

      "bodyText": "Destiny Frasqueri, the multi-hyphenate musician otherwise known as Princess Nokia, arrives at her north London label offices a little late and a lot punk. Dressed in a black Vivienne Westwood number, silver choker and towering tartan platform boots, she is sporting a panoply of piercings, her hair pulled into braids. It is a contrast with previous looks: specs and baggy basketball sweats, a full nu-metal uniform (Slipknot tee, studded wristbands) and even a mermaid phase, during which she called herself Wavy Spice. To call Frasqueri a shapeshifter would be an understatement. Although known mostly as a rapper, over her career she has mined everything from emo and punk to ballroom, folk and lo-fi house. Today she declares herself a \u201clittle hippy stoner\u201d and \u201can old soul\u201d, \u201chonest, normal and lovely\u201d and \u201cvery intelligent\u201d.

      "body": "<p>Frodon may have to be as tough as Denman to make a winning return to the track on Sunday afternoon, according to his trainer, Paul Nicholls. The popular little chaser was front-page news when last seen in public, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/mar/14/bryony-frost-first-woman-ride-grade-one-winner-jumps-cheltenham-festival-horse-racing\" title=\"\">winning the Ryanair Chase</a> in March and making his jockey, Bryony Frost, the first woman to ride a Grade One winner over fences at the Cheltenham Festival.</p> \n<p>On Sunday, he and Frost are reunited as he begins his winter\u2019s work in the same race as last year, Aintree\u2019s Old Roan Chase, carrying at least a stone more than all his rivals. That is a direct consequence of last season\u2019s exploits that raised his rating to 169. \u201cI think the only horse I\u2019ve ever had close to winning a handicap off that sort of mark was Denman,\u201d Nicholls said.</p> \n<p>Denman is still remembered for one of the all-time great weight carrying performances, defying a rating of 174 to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/nov/28/denman-hennessy-gold-cup-newbury\" title=\"\">win his second Hennessy Gold Cup</a> 10 years ago. The Old Roan is nothing like as competitive as a standard Hennessy but it is still asking a huge amount for Frodon \u2013 who lacks Denman\u2019s impressive build \u2013 to carry so much more than classy rivals such as Kalashnikov and Flying Angel, both Grade One winners.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a huge weight, so he\u2019s got to put up a huge performance,\u201d Nicholls said. \u201cIt\u2019s his prep for the Betfair Chase, so this is not the be-all and end-all. He always comes on for a run.\u201d</p> \n<p>Nicholls, who was among the winners here on Saturday, has been finding that most of his horses are in need of their first run at this early stage of the new jumps season. That should not be such a factor for Frodon or Clan Des Obeaux, his contender for Down Royal\u2019s Champion Chase next Saturday. In order to put an edge on their fitness, he took the pair for a racecourse gallop recently. \u201cThey\u2019re fit enough to run very, very well,\u201d said the 11-times champion trainer.</p> \n<p>Quel Destin, who won a juvenile hurdle for Nicholls at Cheltenham, was typical of his recent runners, in that he improved enormously for a recent run on the Flat at Bath, having been arguably disappointing in defeat that day. Black Corton will have to be further forward when he represents the yard in the Charlie Hall at Wetherby next Saturday, when Elegant Escape is likely to line up against him.</p> \n<p>It seems unlikely there were many serious Festival clues on offer on Saturday\u2019s Cheltenham card, though Saint Calvados improved for a wind operation to win a handicap under top weight. He could be a challenger for December\u2019s Altior-free Tingle Creek.</p> \n<p>But the joy of this card was that racing was taking place at all, on a day when quality Flat-racing cards were abandoned at Doncaster and Newbury, both waterlogged. Cheltenham had expected to miss most of the rain but an inspection proved necessary, less than an hour before the first race, a total of 30mm having fallen in the previous 24 hours.</p> \n<p>Few horses were as comfortable sloshing through the resultant muck than Tobefair, who battled to a narrow victory in the Pertemps Qualifier. It was the second time this year he has made it to the hallowed winner\u2019s enclosure here, surrounded by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/mar/12/tobefair-cheltenham-festival-favourite-owned-17-regulars-pub\" title=\"\">his 17 owners</a>, all of them regulars at the Cresselly Arms near Pembroke.

      "bodyText": "Frodon may have to be as tough as Denman to make a winning return to the track on Sunday afternoon, according to his trainer, Paul Nicholls. The popular little chaser was front-page news when last seen in public, winning the Ryanair Chase in March and making his jockey, Bryony Frost, the first woman to ride a Grade One winner over fences at the Cheltenham Festival. On Sunday, he and Frost are reunited as he begins his winter\u2019s work in the same race as last year, Aintree\u2019s Old Roan Chase, carrying at least a stone more than all his rivals. That is a direct consequence of last season\u2019s exploits that raised his rating to 169. \u201cI think the only horse I\u2019ve ever had close to winning a handicap off that sort of mark was Denman,\u201d Nicholls said. Denman is still remembered for one of the all-time great weight carrying performances, defying a rating of 174 to win his second Hennessy Gold Cup 10 years ago. The Old Roan is nothing like as competitive as a standard Hennessy but it is still asking a huge amount for Frodon \u2013 who lacks Denman\u2019s impressive build \u2013 to carry so much more than classy rivals such as Kalashnikov and Flying Angel, both Grade One winners. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge weight, so he\u2019s got to put up a huge performance,\u201d Nicholls said. \u201cIt\u2019s his prep for the Betfair Chase, so this is not the be-all and end-all. He always comes on for a run.\u201d Nicholls, who was among the winners here on Saturday, has been finding that most of his horses are in need of their first run at this early stage of the new jumps season. That should not be such a factor for Frodon or Clan Des Obeaux, his contender for Down Royal\u2019s Champion Chase next Saturday. In order to put an edge on their fitness, he took the pair for a racecourse gallop recently. \u201cThey\u2019re fit enough to run very, very well,\u201d said the 11-times champion trainer. Quel Destin, who won a juvenile hurdle for Nicholls at Cheltenham, was typical of his recent runners, in that he improved enormously for a recent run on the Flat at Bath, having been arguably disappointing in defeat that day. Black Corton will have to be further forward when he represents the yard in the Charlie Hall at Wetherby next Saturday, when Elegant Escape is likely to line up against him. It seems unlikely there were many serious Festival clues on offer on Saturday\u2019s Cheltenham card, though Saint Calvados improved for a wind operation to win a handicap under top weight. He could be a challenger for December\u2019s Altior-free Tingle Creek. But the joy of this card was that racing was taking place at all, on a day when quality Flat-racing cards were abandoned at Doncaster and Newbury, both waterlogged. Cheltenham had expected to miss most of the rain but an inspection proved necessary, less than an hour before the first race, a total of 30mm having fallen in the previous 24 hours. Few horses were as comfortable sloshing through the resultant muck than Tobefair, who battled to a narrow victory in the Pertemps Qualifier. It was the second time this year he has made it to the hallowed winner\u2019s enclosure here, surrounded by his 17 owners, all of them regulars at the Cresselly Arms near Pembroke. It is expected the celebrations will continue until at least kick-off time in Wales\u2019s Rugby World Cup semi-final on Sunday morning. The Vertem Futurity, which was to have been Doncaster\u2019s feature race, is to be restaged on Newcastle\u2019s Tapeta track on Friday evening, with the entries thrown open to new runners. Neither the timing nor the switch to an all-weather surface seem ideal but evidently the ARC racecourse group was determined to keep the contest at one of its tracks.

      "body": "<p>When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/charlotte-gainsbourg\" title=\"\">Charlotte Gainsbourg</a> was 16, she came home from school to find her mother distraught and the police waiting for her. They had just discovered that she was the target of a kidnapping plot. A gang of upper-class teenagers \u2013 journalists called them the <em>blousons dor\u00e9s</em> (golden jacket) gangsters \u2013 had planned to kill a police officer and steal his uniform. Then, using this disguise, they were going to abduct Gainsbourg and demand a 5m franc ransom from her famous parents, Jane Birkin and Serge Gainsbourg. The gang, who had already committed several armed robberies, had found a country house where they were going to hide Gainsbourg. They had even bought shovels with which to bury the police officer.</p> <p>Gainsbourg laughs as she recounts the episode: \u201cI thought it was so cool.\u201d Her mother and father weren\u2019t quite so blase. \u201cI remember my parents being extremely scared and my father made me go to school with a bodyguard.\u201d She stares into her coffee, stirring in milk for longer than is necessary. \u201cI was so ashamed.\u201d</p> <p>Gainsbourg and I are sitting in a chic but uncomfortable corner booth in a hotel cafe in Greenwich Village, New York. The singer, actor and style champion has just come back from Paris fashion week; French<strong> </strong>Vogue is full of pictures of her looking glam in a see-through shirt and tailored suit. She is dressed more simply today, wearing what she describes as her \u201cjean uniform\u201d: skinny jeans and a white T-shirt that, upon closer inspection, bears a Saint Laurent logo and probably costs a small fortune. She leads a jet-set life and works in the most extrovert of industries, but remains notoriously private and uncomfortable with attention. She fiddles anxiously with her necklace as we talk, avoiding too much eye contact. Having to be trailed by bodyguards as a teenager, having all eyes on her while her would-be kidnappers were arrested and, eventually, <a href=\"https://www.lesoir.be/art/%252Findulgence-pour-trois-fils-a-papa_t-19891016-Z02228.html\" title=\"\">sentenced to several years in jail</a>, must have been mortifying.</p> <p>But Gainsbourg spent her childhood in the public eye, with a mother who epitomised 60s cool and a father <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2011/feb/28/serge-gainsbourg-20-scandalous-moments\" title=\"\">whose provocative and often alcohol-soaked antics </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2011/feb/28/serge-gainsbourg-20-scandalous-moments\" title=\"\">often made headlines</a>. There was the time he appeared with Whitney Houston on primetime TV and announced that he wanted \u201cto fuck her\u201d, for example. On another live TV show, he burned a 500 franc note to protest against what he considered excessive taxation. Gainsbourg\u2019s classmates didn\u2019t respond very kindly to that stunt. \u201cAt school, the kids took my worksheet and they burned it,\u201d she says. She laughs quietly. \u201cSo I did get\u2026 I did get bullied.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"04b501a06765e074798d3f445e0818ea9ef79f31\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/04b501a06765e074798d3f445e0818ea9ef79f31/205_96_3446_2068/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With her father Serge, her mother Jane Birkin and half-sister Kate, 1978.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With her father Serge, her mother Jane Birkin and half-sister Kate, 1978.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Her father died of a heart attack in 1991, when Gainsbourg was just 19. She still seems to worship him and says she misses being \u201cable to ask him all the questions about music that I have today\u201d. She speaks fondly of the way he used to come up with melodies and test them on a little focus group consisting of her, her mother, and his artistic director. \u201cWe\u2019d make little asterixes next to the melodies we preferred,\u201d she remembers. \u201cEven though I was just a kid, he wanted my point of view.\u201d</p> <p>When she was 12, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/09/charlotte-gainsbourg-art-shouldnt-be-censored\" title=\"\">Gainsbourg made her musical debut alongside him </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/09/charlotte-gainsbourg-art-shouldnt-be-censored\" title=\"\">on </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/09/charlotte-gainsbourg-art-shouldnt-be-censored\" title=\"\">the song Lemon Incest</a> \u2013 a play on <em>un zeste de citron</em> (a lemon zest). In the infamous video, Gainsbourg is sprawled on a bed while her topless dad caresses her and sings about the love they will never make together. The song, recorded in 1984, was accused of glamorising abuse and paedophilia, but despite the scandal \u2013 or perhaps because of it \u2013 Lemon Incest peaked at No 2 in the French charts.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"139c645a1f3e2722ea6ec03649da3e949e341611\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/139c645a1f3e2722ea6ec03649da3e949e341611/5_919_3335_4167/800.jpg\" alt=\"With her father Serge in the Lemon Incest video, 1985.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With her father Serge in the Lemon Incest video, 1985.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Gainsbourg has spent decades fielding questions about Lemon Incest and is less than thrilled when I ask her whether something similar could be released today, let alone spend 10 weeks in the Top 10, in the era of #MeToo. \u201cIt was already shocking at the time,\u201d she says with faint exasperation. \u201cI remember my father having to explain himself, and his lyrics, because he plays with the <em>jeu de mots</em>, how do you say that? When you play with the sounds of the words, like a double meaning?\u201d Gainsbourg is bilingual, but French is her first language; she pauses occasionally in our conversation to search around for <em>le mot juste</em>. We settle on \u201cpun\u201d and she continues. \u201cIncest is so shocking and so taboo. It\u2019s as if he was amusing himself with that. But when you listen to the lyrics, he\u2019s just talking about the infinite love of a father for his daughter and of a daughter for her father \u2013 and you can\u2019t condemn that. Because there\u2019s nothing physical. So, yes, he <em>says</em> incest, but that\u2019s it. I find it terrible that you can\u2019t talk about things that are\u2026\u201d she trails off, searching around for the right word. \u201cDifficult?\u201d I suggest. \u201cNuanced?\u201d She shrugs. \u201cYou hear the word \u2018incest\u2019 and conversation gets shut off,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s no dialogue.\u201d</p> <p>Social media has made it harder, I suggest: you can imagine the Twitter storms Lemon Incest would provoke today. \u201cYes, but I think my father would be condemned in every move he made,\u201d she says. \u201cEverything now is so politically correct. So boring. So expected. And everyone is so scared of what will happen if they go too far.\u201d Men, in particular, she says, have reason to be scared. \u201cA few tweets and it\u2019s done\u2026 their career is over.\u201d Her dad, she says, would have been miserable today, \u201cbecause it did matter to him what people felt, what people thought, when he got criticised\u201d. He is known as a provocateur, but he was sensitive, Gainsbourg says. \u201cHe got very wounded by a lot of stuff. There were a lot of antisemitic things going on during his life.\u201d And not just during the war, she adds, when, as a 10-year-old in Nazi-occupied France, he was forced to wear a yellow star to mark him as a Jew. \u201cEven afterwards, France was still very antisemitic.\u201d So much so that, when Serge Gainsbourg released <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aux_armes_et_c%C3%A6tera_(album)\" title=\"\">a reggae version of the Marseillaise</a> (a characteristic provocation) in 1979, one newspaper critic accused him of bringing antisemitism upon himself, by \u201ctrying to make money with the national anthem\u201d.</p> <p>Still, Gainsbourg says brightly, she had a \u201ccompletely normal and very simple childhood\u201d. She was born in London, but grew up in Paris. Apart from regular ferry trips to England to see her maternal grandparents, the family travelled little; her father was scared of planes. Her parents split up when she nine, but Gainsbourg remained close to both, as well as her half-sister Kate Barry, the late fashion photographer (Birkin\u2019s first daughter, with the English composer John Barry). All in all, she says, life \u201cwas very square\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Von Trier pushes you into really dark places. I want someone to push me where it\u2019s difficult, where I\u2019m uncomfortable</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>These days, Gainsbourg seems drawn to square pegs in round holes: men like her father who are both outsiders and insiders, who use outrage as a weapon against a society in which they have never felt welcome. Some might call them provocateurs, others perverts. One of her most notable collaborators is the Danish film director <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/lars-von-trier\" title=\"\">Lars </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/lars-von-trier\" title=\"\">von Trier</a>, whose dark, psychological films Gainsbourg has appeared in \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/feb/20/nymphomaniac-volumes-1-and-2-von-trier-bradshaw-review\" title=\"\">Nymphomaniac</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/jul/24/antichrist-lars-von-trier-review\" title=\"\">Antichrist</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/may/18/cannes-2011-review-melancholia\" title=\"\">Melancholia</a> \u2013 reflect his battles with alcoholism, depression and various phobias. (Like Gainsbourg\u2019s father, Von Trier is terrified of flying.) In Von Trier\u2019s films, these battles are often acted out violently on Gainsbourg\u2019s body: in Antichrist, she plays a grieving mother who cuts off her clitoris with a pair of scissors; in Nymphomaniac, her character has graphic sex with strangers.</p> <p>Gainsbourg has often been called Von Trier\u2019s \u201cmuse\u201d \u2013 but that is too passive a word to describe the actor. Part of her allure is that as a performer she is impossible to categorise neatly. She is not a stereotypical sex symbol or a damsel in distress, and she is not just an instrument for older men to act out their provocations; she uses them just as much as they use her. In all of her parts, you get the sense that she is the one in control.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1254c8be58e31594ab4aefcb41a73250ebe98e08\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1254c8be58e31594ab4aefcb41a73250ebe98e08/0_5_5926_7404/800.jpg\" alt=\"Styling: Paul Sinclaire.

In 2017, as #MeToo started to become a mainstream movement, Bj\u00f6rk claimed that she had been sexually harassed by an unnamed film director many assumed to be Von Trier. He denied the allegations.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s true Von Trier pushes you into really dark places,\u201d Gainsbourg says. \u201c[But] that\u2019s what I\u2019m looking for in acting \u2013 I want someone to push me places where I haven\u2019t been, where it\u2019s difficult, where I\u2019m uncomfortable. That\u2019s all I want. For me, a lot of the work is letting go and trusting him all the way.\u201d While she won\u2019t speak for Bj\u00f6rk, she feels her own trust in Von Trier was never betrayed. In Antichrist and Nymphomaniac, for example, he walked through every frame with her to make sure she was comfortable. \u201cI said, the only thing I\u2019m really uncomfortable with are my boobs. So he said OK, and I\u2019m wearing a T-shirt the whole time [in the sex scenes]. I trusted him.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"24611bff7d3dc785f0143c324a6ef30f6cc10210\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/24611bff7d3dc785f0143c324a6ef30f6cc10210/0_101_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In Lars von Trier\u2019s Antichrist, 2009. \" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In Lars von Trier\u2019s Antichrist, 2009.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Gainsbourg released her first album, Charlotte For Ever, when she was 15, then took a long hiatus from music. She didn\u2019t release anything new until 5:55 in 2006, which sold well and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/aug/13/shopping\" title=\"\">had </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/aug/13/shopping\" title=\"\">favourable reviews</a>. She has kept going ever since, exploring a cinematic strain of disco pop, close in spirit to Goldfrapp. While working on her most recent album, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/nov/16/charlotte-gainsbourg-rest-review-musical-chameleon-finds-her-voice\" title=\"\">2017\u2019s Rest</a>, she asked French novelist and provocateur, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/michelhouellebecq\" title=\"\">Michel Houellebecq</a>, if he would write the lyrics. When I bring this up, she looks puzzled. \u201cWho?\u201d \u201cHouellebecq,\u201d I repeat, in my best French accent. \u201cAh!\u201d she says, finally, \u201cHouellebecq! Yes, my producer [S\u00e9bastien Akchot\u00e9] and I had the same passion for his genius. My record company did ask him, but he wasn\u2019t very interested. Anyway, then I realised that I wanted to write the lyrics myself. I do love other people\u2019s writing. I feel very lucky to have worked with Jarvis Cocker and Beck. But it\u2019s so different to write your own lyrics. Touring and being on stage had a purpose. It changed everything.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Gainsbourg and Attal are not married. 'It was never a goal. My mother got married and it was not a success'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Rest is one of her rawest and most personal albums, and a lot of it stems from grief. In December 2013, her half-sister Kate died after falling from a fourth-floor window in Paris. Her death made living in Paris unbearable, Gainsbourg says. A few months after the tragedy, she decamped to New York with her partner and their three children. \u201cI was coming from a very dark place,\u201d she says. In the US, \u201cI was breathing again and seeing new sky. I thought: how come I haven\u2019t done this before? It\u2019s wonderful to just take a bag and go somewhere else.\u201d</p> <p>The anonymity of New York wasn\u2019t just cathartic; it was creatively liberating. \u201cHere, I feel I\u2019m being myself with nobody noticing,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not noticing. I feel very different, because I\u2019m not looking at myself all the time. I don\u2019t think in France I could have released my album and written the lyrics myself.\u201d The album, which blends French and English, reflects on everything from motherhood to the loss of her sister. On Kate, she sings: \u201c<em>On d\u2019vait vieillir ensemble</em> [we were going to grow old together].\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b3d559e1b5b8974ea14d815acc74e1e4d2d5d337\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b3d559e1b5b8974ea14d815acc74e1e4d2d5d337/260_41_2359_2947/800.jpg\" alt=\"Playing live in London, 2012.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Playing live in London, 2012.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In France, Gainsbourg is recognised wherever she goes and is known, first and foremost, as the daughter of Birkin and Serge. In New York, she is finally starting to break free from that history. \u201cI feel ashamed saying this, but when people recognise me here it\u2019s about me,\u201d she says. \u201cThe films I\u2019ve done, a lot of Lars\u2019s films, and my music. I don\u2019t get recognised that often, but when it happens I\u2019m really proud.\u201d</p> <p>At this point, a stocky man, dressed neatly in black, walks in and starts addressing her in French. I assume it is an adoring fan, but it is her partner, the French-Israeli actor and director Yvan Attal. After a second, he apologises to me for being rude and continues in English \u2013 he just wants a quick word about their lunch plans. The quick word is had and he disappears, presenting the perfect opportunity to start talking about him behind his back.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2da238da0ff4373115e2617302b63d2513f9463d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2da238da0ff4373115e2617302b63d2513f9463d/0_62_5926_7404/800.jpg\" alt=\"Charlotte Gainsbourg\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Now, to French people, I sound totally British \u2013 to British people, I don\u2019t.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Colls/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Gainsbourg has been with Attal for 27 years \u2013 they met when she was 19 \u2013 but they are not married. \u201cIt was never a goal,\u201d she says. \u201cOn the contrary. My mother got married [to John Barry, before her relationship with Serge Gainsbourg] and it was not a success. So I felt that it wasn\u2019t part of my plans. And Yvan, he didn\u2019t care at all. Later on, we felt that for the children maybe it would be nice for them, for me to have the same name \u2013 but then I became so superstitious. I\u2019ve heard of a lot of couples who live a long life together, and they get married and split. I thought it was bad luck.\u201d</p> <p>Hang on, I say: if she had chosen to get married, she would have changed her name? \u201cNo, not at all,\u201d she backtracks. \u201cI\u2019m very attached to my name, because of my father. But what\u2019s funny is that I was registered<strong> </strong>under Gainsbourg, which was not my father\u2019s real name. He was called Ginsberg and he changed it for work. On his passport, it was still Ginsberg. When I was 18, I asked to go back to my old name, just to have the same as him. It was such a big deal to go through all the paperwork, but we did it. I\u2019m very proud of it, because that\u2019s my story.

      "bodyText": "When Charlotte Gainsbourg was 16, she came home from school to find her mother distraught and the police waiting for her. They had just discovered that she was the target of a kidnapping plot. A gang of upper-class teenagers \u2013 journalists called them the blousons dor\u00e9s (golden jacket) gangsters \u2013 had planned to kill a police officer and steal his uniform. Then, using this disguise, they were going to abduct Gainsbourg and demand a 5m franc ransom from her famous parents, Jane Birkin and Serge Gainsbourg. The gang, who had already committed several armed robberies, had found a country house where they were going to hide Gainsbourg. They had even bought shovels with which to bury the police officer. Gainsbourg laughs as she recounts the episode: \u201cI thought it was so cool.\u201d Her mother and father weren\u2019t quite so blase. \u201cI remember my parents being extremely scared and my father made me go to school with a bodyguard.\u201d She stares into her coffee, stirring in milk for longer than is necessary. \u201cI was so ashamed.\u201d Gainsbourg and I are sitting in a chic but uncomfortable corner booth in a hotel cafe in Greenwich Village, New York. The singer, actor and style champion has just come back from Paris fashion week; French Vogue is full of pictures of her looking glam in a see-through shirt and tailored suit. She is dressed more simply today, wearing what she describes as her \u201cjean uniform\u201d: skinny jeans and a white T-shirt that, upon closer inspection, bears a Saint Laurent logo and probably costs a small fortune. She leads a jet-set life and works in the most extrovert of industries, but remains notoriously private and uncomfortable with attention. She fiddles anxiously with her necklace as we talk, avoiding too much eye contact. Having to be trailed by bodyguards as a teenager, having all eyes on her while her would-be kidnappers were arrested and, eventually, sentenced to several years in jail, must have been mortifying. But Gainsbourg spent her childhood in the public eye, with a mother who epitomised 60s cool and a father whose provocative and often alcohol-soaked antics often made headlines. There was the time he appeared with Whitney Houston on primetime TV and announced that he wanted \u201cto fuck her\u201d, for example. On another live TV show, he burned a 500 franc note to protest against what he considered excessive taxation. Gainsbourg\u2019s classmates didn\u2019t respond very kindly to that stunt. \u201cAt school, the kids took my worksheet and they burned it,\u201d she says. She laughs quietly. \u201cSo I did get\u2026 I did get bullied.\u201d Her father died of a heart attack in 1991, when Gainsbourg was just 19. She still seems to worship him and says she misses being \u201cable to ask him all the questions about music that I have today\u201d. She speaks fondly of the way he used to come up with melodies and test them on a little focus group consisting of her, her mother, and his artistic director. \u201cWe\u2019d make little asterixes next to the melodies we preferred,\u201d she remembers. \u201cEven though I was just a kid, he wanted my point of view.\u201d When she was 12, Gainsbourg made her musical debut alongside him on the song Lemon Incest \u2013 a play on un zeste de citron (a lemon zest). In the infamous video, Gainsbourg is sprawled on a bed while her topless dad caresses her and sings about the love they will never make together. The song, recorded in 1984, was accused of glamorising abuse and paedophilia, but despite the scandal \u2013 or perhaps because of it \u2013 Lemon Incest peaked at No 2 in the French charts. Gainsbourg has spent decades fielding questions about Lemon Incest and is less than thrilled when I ask her whether something similar could be released today, let alone spend 10 weeks in the Top 10, in the era of #MeToo. \u201cIt was already shocking at the time,\u201d she says with faint exasperation. \u201cI remember my father having to explain himself, and his lyrics, because he plays with the jeu de mots, how do you say that? When you play with the sounds of the words, like a double meaning?\u201d Gainsbourg is bilingual, but French is her first language; she pauses occasionally in our conversation to search around for le mot juste. We settle on \u201cpun\u201d and she continues. \u201cIncest is so shocking and so taboo. It\u2019s as if he was amusing himself with that. But when you listen to the lyrics, he\u2019s just talking about the infinite love of a father for his daughter and of a daughter for her father \u2013 and you can\u2019t condemn that. Because there\u2019s nothing physical. So, yes, he says incest, but that\u2019s it. I find it terrible that you can\u2019t talk about things that are\u2026\u201d she trails off, searching around for the right word. \u201cDifficult?\u201d I suggest. \u201cNuanced?\u201d She shrugs. \u201cYou hear the word \u2018incest\u2019 and conversation gets shut off,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s no dialogue.\u201d Social media has made it harder, I suggest: you can imagine the Twitter storms Lemon Incest would provoke today. \u201cYes, but I think my father would be condemned in every move he made,\u201d she says. \u201cEverything now is so politically correct. So boring. So expected. And everyone is so scared of what will happen if they go too far.\u201d Men, in particular, she says, have reason to be scared. \u201cA few tweets and it\u2019s done\u2026 their career is over.\u201d Her dad, she says, would have been miserable today, \u201cbecause it did matter to him what people felt, what people thought, when he got criticised\u201d. He is known as a provocateur, but he was sensitive, Gainsbourg says. \u201cHe got very wounded by a lot of stuff. There were a lot of antisemitic things going on during his life.\u201d And not just during the war, she adds, when, as a 10-year-old in Nazi-occupied France, he was forced to wear a yellow star to mark him as a Jew. \u201cEven afterwards, France was still very antisemitic.\u201d So much so that, when Serge Gainsbourg released a reggae version of the Marseillaise (a characteristic provocation) in 1979, one newspaper critic accused him of bringing antisemitism upon himself, by \u201ctrying to make money with the national anthem\u201d. Still, Gainsbourg says brightly, she had a \u201ccompletely normal and very simple childhood\u201d. She was born in London, but grew up in Paris. Apart from regular ferry trips to England to see her maternal grandparents, the family travelled little; her father was scared of planes. Her parents split up when she nine, but Gainsbourg remained close to both, as well as her half-sister Kate Barry, the late fashion photographer (Birkin\u2019s first daughter, with the English composer John Barry). All in all, she says, life \u201cwas very square\u201d. These days, Gainsbourg seems drawn to square pegs in round holes: men like her father who are both outsiders and insiders, who use outrage as a weapon against a society in which they have never felt welcome. Some might call them provocateurs, others perverts. One of her most notable collaborators is the Danish film director Lars von Trier, whose dark, psychological films Gainsbourg has appeared in \u2013 Nymphomaniac, Antichrist and Melancholia \u2013 reflect his battles with alcoholism, depression and various phobias. (Like Gainsbourg\u2019s father, Von Trier is terrified of flying.) In Von Trier\u2019s films, these battles are often acted out violently on Gainsbourg\u2019s body: in Antichrist, she plays a grieving mother who cuts off her clitoris with a pair of scissors; in Nymphomaniac, her character has graphic sex with strangers. Gainsbourg has often been called Von Trier\u2019s \u201cmuse\u201d \u2013 but that is too passive a word to describe the actor. Part of her allure is that as a performer she is impossible to categorise neatly. She is not a stereotypical sex symbol or a damsel in distress, and she is not just an instrument for older men to act out their provocations; she uses them just as much as they use her. In all of her parts, you get the sense that she is the one in control. Von Trier\u2019s films have frequently been described as misogynistic, but Gainsbourg rejects that idea, saying that she has done some of her best work with him. \u201cHe gives such wonderful parts to women,\u201d she says. \u201cHow can he be misogynistic if he\u2019s portraying women like that?\u201d What about Bj\u00f6rk, I ask, who starred in his film Dancer In The Dark? In 2017, as #MeToo started to become a mainstream movement, Bj\u00f6rk claimed that she had been sexually harassed by an unnamed film director many assumed to be Von Trier. He denied the allegations. \u201cIt\u2019s true Von Trier pushes you into really dark places,\u201d Gainsbourg says. \u201c[But] that\u2019s what I\u2019m looking for in acting \u2013 I want someone to push me places where I haven\u2019t been, where it\u2019s difficult, where I\u2019m uncomfortable. That\u2019s all I want. For me, a lot of the work is letting go and trusting him all the way.\u201d While she won\u2019t speak for Bj\u00f6rk, she feels her own trust in Von Trier was never betrayed. In Antichrist and Nymphomaniac, for example, he walked through every frame with her to make sure she was comfortable. \u201cI said, the only thing I\u2019m really uncomfortable with are my boobs. So he said OK, and I\u2019m wearing a T-shirt the whole time [in the sex scenes]. I trusted him.\u201d Gainsbourg released her first album, Charlotte For Ever, when she was 15, then took a long hiatus from music. She didn\u2019t release anything new until 5:55 in 2006, which sold well and had favourable reviews. She has kept going ever since, exploring a cinematic strain of disco pop, close in spirit to Goldfrapp. While working on her most recent album, 2017\u2019s Rest, she asked French novelist and provocateur, Michel Houellebecq, if he would write the lyrics. When I bring this up, she looks puzzled. \u201cWho?\u201d \u201cHouellebecq,\u201d I repeat, in my best French accent. \u201cAh!\u201d she says, finally, \u201cHouellebecq! Yes, my producer [S\u00e9bastien Akchot\u00e9] and I had the same passion for his genius. My record company did ask him, but he wasn\u2019t very interested. Anyway, then I realised that I wanted to write the lyrics myself. I do love other people\u2019s writing. I feel very lucky to have worked with Jarvis Cocker and Beck. But it\u2019s so different to write your own lyrics. Touring and being on stage had a purpose. It changed everything.\u201d Rest is one of her rawest and most personal albums, and a lot of it stems from grief. In December 2013, her half-sister Kate died after falling from a fourth-floor window in Paris. Her death made living in Paris unbearable, Gainsbourg says. A few months after the tragedy, she decamped to New York with her partner and their three children. \u201cI was coming from a very dark place,\u201d she says. In the US, \u201cI was breathing again and seeing new sky. I thought: how come I haven\u2019t done this before? It\u2019s wonderful to just take a bag and go somewhere else.\u201d The anonymity of New York wasn\u2019t just cathartic; it was creatively liberating. \u201cHere, I feel I\u2019m being myself with nobody noticing,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not noticing. I feel very different, because I\u2019m not looking at myself all the time. I don\u2019t think in France I could have released my album and written the lyrics myself.\u201d The album, which blends French and English, reflects on everything from motherhood to the loss of her sister. On Kate, she sings: \u201cOn d\u2019vait vieillir ensemble [we were going to grow old together].\u201d In France, Gainsbourg is recognised wherever she goes and is known, first and foremost, as the daughter of Birkin and Serge. In New York, she is finally starting to break free from that history. \u201cI feel ashamed saying this, but when people recognise me here it\u2019s about me,\u201d she says. \u201cThe films I\u2019ve done, a lot of Lars\u2019s films, and my music. I don\u2019t get recognised that often, but when it happens I\u2019m really proud.\u201d At this point, a stocky man, dressed neatly in black, walks in and starts addressing her in French. I assume it is an adoring fan, but it is her partner, the French-Israeli actor and director Yvan Attal. After a second, he apologises to me for being rude and continues in English \u2013 he just wants a quick word about their lunch plans. The quick word is had and he disappears, presenting the perfect opportunity to start talking about him behind his back. Gainsbourg has been with Attal for 27 years \u2013 they met when she was 19 \u2013 but they are not married. \u201cIt was never a goal,\u201d she says. \u201cOn the contrary. My mother got married [to John Barry, before her relationship with Serge Gainsbourg] and it was not a success. So I felt that it wasn\u2019t part of my plans. And Yvan, he didn\u2019t care at all. Later on, we felt that for the children maybe it would be nice for them, for me to have the same name \u2013 but then I became so superstitious. I\u2019ve heard of a lot of couples who live a long life together, and they get married and split. I thought it was bad luck.\u201d Hang on, I say: if she had chosen to get married, she would have changed her name? \u201cNo, not at all,\u201d she backtracks. \u201cI\u2019m very attached to my name, because of my father. But what\u2019s funny is that I was registered under Gainsbourg, which was not my father\u2019s real name. He was called Ginsberg and he changed it for work. On his passport, it was still Ginsberg. When I was 18, I asked to go back to my old name, just to have the same as him. It was such a big deal to go through all the paperwork, but we did it. I\u2019m very proud of it, because that\u2019s my story. I feel very close to that past.\u201d How does England fit into her story, I ask? She was born in London and her mother is English, but she lived only in France, before moving to New York. \u201cI feel I\u2019m pretending to be English,\u201d she says, quickly. \u201cFor a long time [growing up], I was very proud of being French. I had a very thick French accent and I wasn\u2019t making any effort [to be English]; I was the French cousin. But gradually I wanted to feel part of that world. Now, to French people, I sound totally British \u2013 to British people, I don\u2019t. I have this pride in being English, but at the same time there\u2019s nothing really there. Anytime I go to London, I feel like I don\u2019t belong.\u201d The English \u201cdon\u2019t let you in very easily\u201d, she explains. Has Brexit made her feel even less English? \u201cNo,\u201d she says. \u201cI am very proud of my British passport. It is so stupid. It\u2019s a little booklet, but I cherish it. Maybe it\u2019s my mother, who transmitted something, some pride in that nationality.\u201d She has lived in New York for five years, but says there is a cultural divide she hasn\u2019t been able to bridge. \u201cI haven\u2019t been able to get close to American friends. I feel I don\u2019t understand them completely. It\u2019s hard to \u2013 I feel stupid making generalities, but it\u2019s so money-oriented. In France, we\u2019re all about having lunch, dinner. It\u2019s a real art of life, art de vivre,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what I love. I love time off.\u201d In the US, she says, everyone is working all the time. \u201cI feel they pretend that\u2019s what they want, but they\u2019re just forced to work all the time.\u201d For all this, Gainsbourg admits that she is a workaholic herself. She has released five albums and been in more than 40 movies; her latest is a French comedy called My Dog Stupid, directed by Attal and featuring her son, 22-year-old Ben (her daughters, Alice, 16, and Joe, eight, live with her in New York). She also models, and is the face of Saint Laurent. But while she doesn\u2019t show any signs of slowing down, she has started to worry that the work will dry up as she gets older. \u201cI\u2019m not at peace with [ageing] at all,\u201d she says. \u201cI think maybe when I\u2019m 60 I\u2019ll be at peace with it, because I\u2019ll be an old lady and it\u2019ll show.\u201d For the moment, she is \u201choping that I still look young\u201d, although occasionally she finds herself surprised when she looks in the mirror and sees that \u201cI do have wrinkles\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s tough,\u201d she says of getting older in the entertainment industry. \u201cIt\u2019s a job where you\u2019re not supposed to age. The parts get thinner and thinner. The work will become less and less consistent. But, in a way, I\u2019ve already passed that. I had an agent who said: \u2018Past 40, you\u2019re going downhill,\u2019 which was so depressing.\u201d Now she is approaching 50 and still getting parts, still making music. After decades of grappling with the burden of her name, Gainsbourg is starting to consider herself a success in her own right; to feel that it is OK to be proud of herself. She may worry about wrinkles, but she is finally comfortable in her own skin. \u2022 Charlotte Gainsbourg wears Saint Laurent by Anthony Vaccarello If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication). \u2022 Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure discussion remains on topics raised by the writer.

Although he allows himself only one direct reference to \u201cBritain\u2019s deluded, masochistic departure from the European Union\u201d, in an author\u2019s note at the end, the publication of <em>The Man in the Red Coat</em> couldn\u2019t be more timely. An elegant mix of biography, history and art, it tells the life story of a now little-known 19th-century Paris doctor, whom he deploys as \u201ca sort of pilot fish\u201d to explore the murky waters beneath the glittering surface of the belle epoque, \u201can age of neurotic, even hysterical national anxiety, filled with political instability, crises and scandals\u201d.</p> <p>In fact the germ of the book dates back to 2015, before the referendum, when the author\u2019s curiosity was piqued by a painting in the National Portrait Gallery\u2019s John Singer Sargent exhibition. While most of the portraits were of famous people, the man in the red coat was one Dr Samuel Pozzi, a gynaecologist. He was also, the label informed him, a Don Juan. \u201cWhen I first saw him I didn\u2019t think he was anything to do with us here now,\u201d Barnes says of that initial encounter with <em><a href=\"https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/644345\" title=\"\">Dr Pozzi a</a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/644345\" title=\"\">t Home</a></em>, but the more he researched the period, the more unavoidable the parallels became. \u201cExtreme nationalism, nativism, antisemitism, xenophobia: they were very lurid times and we have very lurid times now.\u201d</p> <p>So why not write a satire, a la <em>England, England</em>, or, more recently, Ian McEwan\u2019s comic Brexit parable <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/oct/07/the-cockroach-ian-mcewan-review\" title=\"\">Cockroach</a></em>? \u201cI\u2019m a writer who takes time to discover what he wants to write about,\u201d he replies. \u201cSo I\u2019m very glad that my old, dear friend Ian has gone straight for it. I\u2019m not that kind of writer. I write mine in advance, you see, and then reality happens!\u201d</p> <p>Then why not tell the story of Pozzi and his circle \u2013 with its duels, infidelities and \u201cspectacular ending\u201d \u2013 as a novel, like the fictionalised biography of the Russian composer Dmitri Shostakovich in Barnes\u2019s 2016 novel <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/22/the-noise-of-time-by-julian-barnes-shostakovich-stalin-review\" title=\"\">The Noise of Time</a></em>, or the similarly fact-based <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/jun/26/fiction.shopping\" title=\"\">Arthur and George</a></em> (2005), or even <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/mar/05/fiction.julianbarnes\" title=\"\">Flaubert\u2019s Parrot</a></em> back in 1984? \u201cHe is known to us by a real portrait,\u201d Barnes says. \u201cI somehow felt that if I did it as a fiction it might be more ordinary, you might think these melodramatic Technicolor episodes were just invented by the writer. It is good to get back to the rigour of non-fiction occasionally.\u201d</p> <p>He was intrigued by the idea of an \u201cintellectual and aesthetic shopping trip\u201d to London, on which Pozzi embarked in the summer of 1885, accompanied by Prince Edmond de Polignac and Count Robert de Montesquiou. This \u201cstrange trio\u201d \u2013 \u201ca famously heterosexual commoner alongside two aristocrats of \u2018Hellenic tendencies\u2019\u201d \u2013 were given a letter of introduction from Sargent to Henry James. \u201cThey were the big five,\u201d he says. The dandy Montesquiou owned a pet tortoise, whose shell was painted gold and studded with precious stones: with its accumulation of discrete yet interconnected narratives and sparkly details, all polished to a high Barnesian sheen, the book might have been called Montesquiou\u2019s Tortoise. \u201cIf I had 6p or a euro since <em>Flaubert\u2019s Parrot</em> for every time someone suggested Pushkin\u2019s Button or Tolstoy\u2019s Gerbil \u2026 \u201d Barnes smiles patiently.

He is often described as \u201curbane\u201d (he winces at \u201cgentlemanly\u201d \u2013 \u201ca bit patronising\u201d): genial but gently mocking in manner, crisply dressed and carefully spoken (a self-confessed stickler, he started out as a lexicographer on the <em>OED</em>), he would be well cast in a le Carr\u00e9 adaptation.</p> <p><em>Nothing to Be Frightened Of </em>describes \u201cthe decent dullness\u201d of his postwar upbringing; his parents, both French teachers, moved from Leicester to Northwood, north-west London, the \u201cMetroland\u201d of his debut, shortly after he was born. Next March, it will be 40 years since the publication of that first book: he has written 13 novels \u2013 not including the four crime novels written in the 80s under the pseudonym Dan Kavanagh \u2013 and been shortlisted for the Booker prize four times, winning it in 2011 for <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jul/26/sense-ending-julian-barnes-review1\" title=\"\">The Sense of an Ending</a></em>. We have Barnes to thank for the description of the Booker as <a href=\"https://www.lrb.co.uk/v09/n20/julian-barnes/diary\" title=\"\">\u201cposh bingo\u201d</a>, coined back in 1987: to treat it as such is the only way to survive being shortlisted, he says now. \u201cUntil such a time as you win ... \u201d</p> <p>Last Sunday marked the 11th anniversary of the death of Barnes\u2019s wife, the formidable literary agent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/oct/22/publishing-kavanagh-julian-barnes\" title=\"\">Pat Kavanagh</a>. \u201cI was 32 when we met, 62 when she died,\u201d he writes in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/apr/10/levels-life-julian-barnes-review\" title=\"\">Levels of Life</a></em>, his devastating 2013 reckoning with grief. \u201cThe heart of my life; the life of my heart.\u201d For three decades they were an imposing presence in a London literary scene that included McEwan, Martin Amis, Kazuo Ishiguro and Salman Rushdie: a British \u201cBig Five\u201d writing at the end of the century, with their own share of spats and scandal. In the 1980s as in the 1880s, \u201cthe rich gallimaufry of fame\u201d, as Barnes writes, was predominantly male. Today, although he has good male friends, he says, \u201cI prefer women\u2019s company \u2013 there\u2019s no sense of stags head-butting, that sort of stuff.\u201d And nothing makes him cry \u201clike the women\u2019s rowing coxless pair or four or eight winning a gold medal, which I don\u2019t do with male sport.\u201d</p> <p>He is a fan of football (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/06/julian-barnes-leicester-city-premier-league-stupid-love\" title=\"\">a lifelong Leicester City supporter</a>), Roger Federer (who lacks \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/may/15/the-mighty-fed-julian-barnes-reviews-federer-and-me-story-obsession-william-skidelsky\" title=\"\">all that strutting male bullshit</a>\u201d), food (he wrote a column called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/nov/02/houseandgarden.foodanddrink\" title=\"\">The Pedant in the Kitchen</a> for this paper) \u2013 and \u201cthe big F\u201d Flaubert, to whom he remains unswervingly devoted. From <em>Metroland</em> onwards, Barnes\u2019s work might be summed up by the title of his 1996 collection of short stories <em>Cross Channel</em>: anchored somewhere, as he puts it, in the sea. And <em>The Man in the Red Coat</em> is no exception: the adverb \u201cFrenchly\u201d popping up cheekily throughout. His fiction is famous for its cool dissection of Englishness combined with a European cerebral playfulness and, as his mother noted, rather a lot of \u201cfilth\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ve written about sex in my books before,\u201d he notes drolly. But in France, where he has a loyal following and was awarded the L\u00e9gion d\u2019honneur in 2017, he is regarded as quintessentially <em>anglais</em>. An early interview with a French journalist reported that he walks his dog in the morning and mows his lawn in the afternoon. He doesn\u2019t have a dog, and mows his lawn \u201cwith extreme reluctance\u201d, he laughs.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>What people got up to in bed, so long as there was no violence or cruelty or lack of consent, 120 years ago \u2013 how much does it matter?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The French have \u201calways been nice to me\u201d, he says. \u201cThey just took <em>Flaubert\u2019s Parrot</em> on board. They were so much more welcoming than if some unheard-of French novelist had written an upside-down, semi-fictional book about Dickens.\u201d And they have been quick to claim last year\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/26/the-only-story-julian-barnes-review\" title=\"\">The Only Story</a></em>, about a love affair between a 19-year-old graduate and a much older woman set in leafy Surrey, as their own. \u201c<em>Aha, c\u2019est comme Madame Macron</em>!\u201d</p> <p>Barnes feels President Macron has been \u201cheld back by Madame Merkel\u201d in his dealings with the British government over Brexit. \u201cI think they would have gone much harder in on us. What do you expect if our prime minister is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2019/jun/28/boris-johnson-i-dont-remember-calling-the-french-turds-video\" title=\"\">on record as having referred to the French as turds</a>? Our former foreign secretary [Jeremy Hunt] said the European Union was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/oct/01/jeremy-hunt-draws-eu-ire-over-soviet-prison-comparison\" title=\"\">like the Soviet Union</a>. And the one before that, Johnson, said the EU\u2019s plans for Europe were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/16/tories-divided-by-boris-johnsons-eu-hitler-comparison\" title=\"\">the same as Hitler\u2019s plans for Europe</a>. Do you expect them to cut us a good deal? So childish. And so stupid,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are about to enter a negotiation for a trade deal that might take 10 years. They will get their money one way or another.\u201d</p> <p>He despairs at the insularity of the English political elite, and finds himself in support of \u201calmost all of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s major policies\u201d: on nuclear disarmament, renationalising the railways, removing charitable status from public schools, taxing the rich. </p> <p>Barnes has lived in the same house in Tufnell Park, north London, since 1983; writing in the same study and on the same IBM 196c electric typewriter. He reserves his computer for journalism, nothing \u201cmore creative\u201d. But while writing <em>Arthur and George</em>, both his typewriter and emergency back-up broke down \u2013 his punishment for mocking its hero Conan Doyle\u2019s spiritualism, perhaps. \u201cI thought \u2018God \u2013 you are doing it!\u2019\u201d he jokes, shaking his fist at the sky. He wrote three chapters on the computer and printed them out, but \u201cit didn\u2019t sound like me\u201d. Instead of a \u201cloose, free-flowing first draft, I got a three-quarters corrected one\u201d. McEwan loves the computer\u2019s ability to cut and paste, which he sees as \u201ca reflection of the human brain. But it\u2019s not a reflection of my human brain. It\u2019s completely silent. It\u2019s inert, whereas the electric typewriter has this lovely hum and then it goes clatter clatter clatter clatter. It hums as if to say: \u2018At your leisure, but I\u2019m still here. I\u2019m ready to take dictation.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>He has similarly strong feelings about listening to music while writing, a sure sign that \u201cyou haven\u2019t got any of your own music. How can you hear the rhythm of a sentence?\u201d he asks sternly. He doesn\u2019t invent characters and then ask what will happen to them, but rather: \u201cWhat should they do?\u201d \u201cMoral questions often show themselves more clearly and more immediately in sexual relationships than elsewhere,\u201d he says. \u201cSome might think that I let Pozzi off,\u201d he says of the doctor\u2019s reputation as an \u201cincorrigible seducer\u201d. \u201cI lay out the evidence such as I can be sure of. But what people got up to in bed, so long as there was no violence or cruelty or lack of consent, 120 years ago \u2013 how much does it matter?\u201d</p> <p>He loves writing as much, if not more than ever, and gets \u201cgrumpy\u201d if he doesn\u2019t write for a few days. \u201cI enjoy the solitude of it. I always have.\u201d And it was writing that kept him sane after Kavanagh\u2019s death: \u201cAs a writer you have the advantage of being able to express lucidly terrible things that have happened. I don\u2019t say that makes it any easier to bear, but it does mean that you know what you are talking about.\u201d</p> <p>Barnes has thought about his own death every day since his early teens. \u201cThat\u2019s how I am.\u201d His work can be read as a lifelong disquisition on ageing, memory and the inevitability of extinction: \u201call that stuff\u201d. But at 73 he is in good spirits. Spending time with Pozzi has left him feeling upbeat, and <em>The Man in the Red Coat</em> isn\u2019t written in the melancholy key of many of his books. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll start writing about being young and cheerful,\u201d he says.</p> <p>But he is only cautiously optimistic about our current impasse: \u201cI think we have to be very ingenious. And we have to be very concordial and recognise our similarities and our weaknesses,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think we are very good at that.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022 The Man in the Red Coat by Julian Barnes is published by Jonathan Cape (RRP \u00a318.99).

Or maybe not. This hybrid form most closely resembles Nothing to Be Frightened Of, Barnes\u2019s 2008 memoir-cum-meditation on mortality, which \u201cmoves around in the way that the brain moves around when thinking about death and family and stuff like that,\u201d he explains. \u201cThat\u2019s how I think and therefore that\u2019s how I write.\u201d It is also how he talks, his conversation full of ready quotations, answering questions with anecdotes; the wry indirectness of his writing is reflected in his slightly disconcerting habit of seeming to address an invisible third party, before turning to deliver the punchline. He is often described as \u201curbane\u201d (he winces at \u201cgentlemanly\u201d \u2013 \u201ca bit patronising\u201d): genial but gently mocking in manner, crisply dressed and carefully spoken (a self-confessed stickler, he started out as a lexicographer on the OED), he would be well cast in a le Carr\u00e9 adaptation. Nothing to Be Frightened Of describes \u201cthe decent dullness\u201d of his postwar upbringing; his parents, both French teachers, moved from Leicester to Northwood, north-west London, the \u201cMetroland\u201d of his debut, shortly after he was born. Next March, it will be 40 years since the publication of that first book: he has written 13 novels \u2013 not including the four crime novels written in the 80s under the pseudonym Dan Kavanagh \u2013 and been shortlisted for the Booker prize four times, winning it in 2011 for The Sense of an Ending. We have Barnes to thank for the description of the Booker as \u201cposh bingo\u201d, coined back in 1987: to treat it as such is the only way to survive being shortlisted, he says now. \u201cUntil such a time as you win ... \u201d Last Sunday marked the 11th anniversary of the death of Barnes\u2019s wife, the formidable literary agent Pat Kavanagh. \u201cI was 32 when we met, 62 when she died,\u201d he writes in Levels of Life, his devastating 2013 reckoning with grief. \u201cThe heart of my life; the life of my heart.\u201d For three decades they were an imposing presence in a London literary scene that included McEwan, Martin Amis, Kazuo Ishiguro and Salman Rushdie: a British \u201cBig Five\u201d writing at the end of the century, with their own share of spats and scandal. In the 1980s as in the 1880s, \u201cthe rich gallimaufry of fame\u201d, as Barnes writes, was predominantly male. Today, although he has good male friends, he says, \u201cI prefer women\u2019s company \u2013 there\u2019s no sense of stags head-butting, that sort of stuff.\u201d And nothing makes him cry \u201clike the women\u2019s rowing coxless pair or four or eight winning a gold medal, which I don\u2019t do with male sport.\u201d He is a fan of football (a lifelong Leicester City supporter), Roger Federer (who lacks \u201call that strutting male bullshit\u201d), food (he wrote a column called The Pedant in the Kitchen for this paper) \u2013 and \u201cthe big F\u201d Flaubert, to whom he remains unswervingly devoted. From Metroland onwards, Barnes\u2019s work might be summed up by the title of his 1996 collection of short stories Cross Channel: anchored somewhere, as he puts it, in the sea. And The Man in the Red Coat is no exception: the adverb \u201cFrenchly\u201d popping up cheekily throughout. His fiction is famous for its cool dissection of Englishness combined with a European cerebral playfulness and, as his mother noted, rather a lot of \u201cfilth\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ve written about sex in my books before,\u201d he notes drolly.

He doesn\u2019t have a dog, and mows his lawn \u201cwith extreme reluctance\u201d, he laughs. The French have \u201calways been nice to me\u201d, he says. \u201cThey just took Flaubert\u2019s Parrot on board. They were so much more welcoming than if some unheard-of French novelist had written an upside-down, semi-fictional book about Dickens.\u201d And they have been quick to claim last year\u2019s The Only Story, about a love affair between a 19-year-old graduate and a much older woman set in leafy Surrey, as their own. \u201cAha, c\u2019est comme Madame Macron!\u201d Barnes feels President Macron has been \u201cheld back by Madame Merkel\u201d in his dealings with the British government over Brexit. \u201cI think they would have gone much harder in on us. What do you expect if our prime minister is on record as having referred to the French as turds? Our former foreign secretary [Jeremy Hunt] said the European Union was like the Soviet Union. And the one before that, Johnson, said the EU\u2019s plans for Europe were the same as Hitler\u2019s plans for Europe. Do you expect them to cut us a good deal? So childish. And so stupid,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are about to enter a negotiation for a trade deal that might take 10 years. They will get their money one way or another.\u201d He despairs at the insularity of the English political elite, and finds himself in support of \u201calmost all of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s major policies\u201d: on nuclear disarmament, renationalising the railways, removing charitable status from public schools, taxing the rich. Barnes has lived in the same house in Tufnell Park, north London, since 1983; writing in the same study and on the same IBM 196c electric typewriter. He reserves his computer for journalism, nothing \u201cmore creative\u201d. But while writing Arthur and George, both his typewriter and emergency back-up broke down \u2013 his punishment for mocking its hero Conan Doyle\u2019s spiritualism, perhaps. \u201cI thought \u2018God \u2013 you are doing it!\u2019\u201d he jokes, shaking his fist at the sky. He wrote three chapters on the computer and printed them out, but \u201cit didn\u2019t sound like me\u201d. Instead of a \u201cloose, free-flowing first draft, I got a three-quarters corrected one\u201d. McEwan loves the computer\u2019s ability to cut and paste, which he sees as \u201ca reflection of the human brain. But it\u2019s not a reflection of my human brain. It\u2019s completely silent. It\u2019s inert, whereas the electric typewriter has this lovely hum and then it goes clatter clatter clatter clatter. It hums as if to say: \u2018At your leisure, but I\u2019m still here. I\u2019m ready to take dictation.\u2019\u201d He has similarly strong feelings about listening to music while writing, a sure sign that \u201cyou haven\u2019t got any of your own music. How can you hear the rhythm of a sentence?\u201d he asks sternly. He doesn\u2019t invent characters and then ask what will happen to them, but rather: \u201cWhat should they do?\u201d \u201cMoral questions often show themselves more clearly and more immediately in sexual relationships than elsewhere,\u201d he says. \u201cSome might think that I let Pozzi off,\u201d he says of the doctor\u2019s reputation as an \u201cincorrigible seducer\u201d. \u201cI lay out the evidence such as I can be sure of. But what people got up to in bed, so long as there was no violence or cruelty or lack of consent, 120 years ago \u2013 how much does it matter?\u201d He loves writing as much, if not more than ever, and gets \u201cgrumpy\u201d if he doesn\u2019t write for a few days. \u201cI enjoy the solitude of it. I always have.\u201d And it was writing that kept him sane after Kavanagh\u2019s death: \u201cAs a writer you have the advantage of being able to express lucidly terrible things that have happened. I don\u2019t say that makes it any easier to bear, but it does mean that you know what you are talking about.\u201d Barnes has thought about his own death every day since his early teens. \u201cThat\u2019s how I am.\u201d His work can be read as a lifelong disquisition on ageing, memory and the inevitability of extinction: \u201call that stuff\u201d. But at 73 he is in good spirits. Spending time with Pozzi has left him feeling upbeat, and The Man in the Red Coat isn\u2019t written in the melancholy key of many of his books. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll start writing about being young and cheerful,\u201d he says. But he is only cautiously optimistic about our current impasse: \u201cI think we have to be very ingenious. And we have to be very concordial and recognise our similarities and our weaknesses,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think we are very good at that.\u201d \u2022 The Man in the Red Coat by Julian Barnes is published by Jonathan Cape (RRP \u00a318.99).

Meanwhile, the BBC reported that Nguyen Dinh Luong, 20, was also feared to be among the 39 victims. Three of the families, all with missing sons \u2013 one born in 2004 \u2013 had been sent word that their loved ones would shortly arrive in Britain. \u201cThey said they received information that their family members were about to reach the UK on 23 October, that they should be prepared to pay. But then the contact disappeared,\u201d Hoa Nghiem, a coordinator at Human Rights Space, a civic network based in Vietnam, said. It was also reported that two other Vietnamese families have relatives missing: a 26-year-old man and a 19-year-old woman. The 19-year-old\u2019s brother told the BBC she called him early on Tuesday to say she was getting into a container and would be switching her phone off to avoid detection. They have not heard from her since and the people smugglers have since returned money to the family. Relatives of the 26-year-old, with whom she was travelling, have also been given some money back. The Vietnamese embassy in London confirmed it had contacted police to seek further information. A spokesman said it had been contacted by a family in Vietnam who claimed their daughter had been missing since the lorry was found. The BBC later reported that Pham\u2019s family had to pay \u00a330,000 to traffickers for her journey to the UK. A family acquaintance confirmed to the Guardian that Pham\u2019s family had to remortgage their home to pay the sum. Trafficked migrants are rarely on any kind of formal manifesto and victims\u2019 families may in some cases be in danger themselves if they acknowledge their disappearance. They may also fear that by going public they will put their loved one at risk of arrest if they are in fact still alive. Essex police urged anyone who thinks their friends or relatives may have been in the trailer to contact them \u2013 even individuals who may be \u201cliving illegally in this country\u201d. \u201cPlease come forward and speak to us without fear,\u201d Mills said. \u201cI can assure you that your information will be received in strictest confidence and no criminal action will be taken against you.\u201d Mimi Vu, a leading expert on trafficking of Vietnamese young people to Europe and the UK, said the texts appeared to be authentic. \u201cShe writes her name and where she is from, which is very important, to tell people where she should be buried. It is important for the body to be returned to the place of birth,\u201d said Vu, who has been working in Vietnam on trafficking and slavery issues for the past seven years. She noted that occasionally people were given false Chinese passports if they were trafficked through China, which could lead to confusion. Following Pham\u2019s disappearance, her brother posted a message on a forum regularly used by Vietnamese people looking for missing relatives. He wrote that Pham, who lived in the Nghen township in Can Loc district, left the rural province of Ha Tinh in northern Vietnam on 3 October before travelling to the capital, Hanoi, to \u201cfinalise her papers to go China\u201d. She then flew to France and on to the UK, he said. However, she was allegedly arrested on arrival in the UK before being sent back to France. In the post, her brother added: \u201cShe was arrested a few days ago by UK police and they returned her to France. Now we heard that she might have died. I am posting to ask for her whereabouts and if you tell me your projection about her situation.\u201d Nghiem said she had spoken with a lawyer who was trying to help the family. She said: \u201cThe girl\u2019s family got in touch with the lawyer \u2013 who has dealt with cases like this before \u2013 asking if she could help. They are desperate for any information about their daughter.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>As Hong Kong marched for an 11th consecutive week in August, 20 miles away a drone floated noiselessly over the Shenzhen Bay Sports Centre. It captured coordinated teams of men running across the lush grass-painted lines of a football pitch, but there were no footballs in sight. Instead, dozens of paramilitary vehicles from China\u2019s People\u2019s Armed Police paraded the streets of Shenzhen and settled in the arena. Satellite pictures showed more than 100 sitting tidily around the perimeter of the pitch. The military exercises were widely perceived to be an intimidation tactic, to show what China could do in Hong Kong if it really wanted to. Sports and politics were in perfect harmony.</p> <p>There will be none of those vehicles on show at the Shenzhen Bay Sports Centre. Instead, the eight best women\u2019s tennis players and doubles teams in the world have descended on the complex as the WTA Finals comes to Shenzhen for the first time.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/16/coco-gauff-wimbledon-generation-tennis\">Coco Gauff: \u2018My generation has just decided it is time to speak up\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Pound for pound, it is essentially the most lucrative tennis event in history \u2013 men\u2019s or women\u2019s. The figures are astonishing: the total prize money stands at $14m (\u00a310.75m), far outstripping the $8m on offer by the ATP\u2019s equivalent event at the O<sub>2</sub> Arena in London. If undefeated, the champion will take home $4.725m compared with the record $3.8m pocketed by the US Open champions this year.</p> <p>Steve Simon, the WTA\u2019s CEO, has said: \u201cThere was a true commitment here, trying to do something about \u2018walking the walk\u2019 when it comes to women\u2019s empowerment. It made a huge impression on us when we saw someone who didn\u2019t just talk the talk.\u201d</p> <p>It is clearly a symbolic moment: women being paid more than men, slowly gaining even more access to the money usually reserved for male athletes.</p> <p>Money is always symbolic in women\u2019s tennis because of everything it comes from. Forty\u2011nine years ago, the Women\u2019s Tennis Association was forged partly in the defiant flames of a different era of protests. In <em>We Have Come A Long Way,</em> her 1989 history of women\u2019s tennis, Billie Jean King wrote: \u201cThe issues of the previous decade [the 60s] \u2013 the Vietnam war, racial prejudice, the environment and women\u2019s rights \u2013 were more a part of our consciousness than ever.\u201d</p> <p>In a sport governed from top to bottom by men, female players had long grown accustomed to competing for fractions of the prize money gifted to their male colleagues.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2c2fb459c82cc1cb5e9cc759fa524f3ef89cf6ea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2c2fb459c82cc1cb5e9cc759fa524f3ef89cf6ea/0_118_2500_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Thousands of Chinese military personnel perform drills at the Shenzhen Bay Sports Centre in August.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thousands of Chinese military personnel perform drills at the Shenzhen Bay Sports Centre in August.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: STR/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Just before the 1970 US Open, the tennis promoter Jack Kramer offered the men prize money of $12,500 and the women $1,500 for the Pacific Southwest Championships in California. Women who failed to reach the quarter-finals would earn nothing but he implored them to play for the love of the game.</p> <p>It was an insult too far. As Kramer threatened to banish them from his US Lawn Tennis Association and their status in other major events came under fire, a group of players led by King risked everything by choosing to boycott his event in favour of forming their own tour.</p> <p>In 1973, the Virginia Slims Circuit made way for the WTA Tour and soon became the machine that now makes millionaires on a monthly basis. On the day the \u201cOriginal Nine\u201d announced that they would boycott Kramer\u2019s event, they signed a contract worth $1 and each held up a dollar bill to the sky.</p> <p>It can be easy to forget just how big women\u2019s tennis is. In an intolerant world where even its greatest player, Serena Williams, still receives scorn for the audacity of being an athlete with muscles, women\u2019s tennis is a triumph. For the past 49 years, it has been the largest women\u2019s sport \u2013 nothing else comes close. On the Forbes list of highest-paid female athletes this year, the top 11 names are tennis players. On and off the court, the WTA has proven capable of generating transcendent superstars and delivering profound cultural moments.</p> <p>None of those moments have been more pivotal to recent WTA history than the rise of Li Na, the charismatic Chinese player who broke away from the centralised tennis system and became a champion. Her triumphs at the French Open in 2011 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jan/25/li-na-wins-australian-open-final-dominika-cibulkova\" title=\"\">the Australian Open in 2014 </a>made small ripples in the west but in China she reshaped the sporting scene in her image.</p> <p>The WTA has since spent more than half a decade pushing hard into China. It now has offices in Beijing and holds nine tournaments in the country, while eight remain in the United States. One day at a Chinese tournament makes it clear why. Their Chinese partners do not think small; with each new event comes a towering new stadium and vast sums from major sponsors to tennis projects stretching far beyond the tournament.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"87881ede6d1fb90d3bceee6182c4876450af69bc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/87881ede6d1fb90d3bceee6182c4876450af69bc/0_631_7494_4495/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A satellite image of the huge gathering of personnel and military vehicles in Shenzhen, just a few miles from Hong Kong.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A satellite image of the huge gathering of personnel and military vehicles in Shenzhen, just a few miles from Hong Kong.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Maxar Technologies/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While the WTA was in the midst of a mammoth eight weeks in China, the way people speak about the country\u2019s rising presence in world sporting events shifted. When the Houston Rockets general manager, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/07/nba-hong-kong-protests-china-houston-rockets-daryl-morey\" title=\"\">Daryl Morey, tweeted </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/07/nba-hong-kong-protests-china-houston-rockets-daryl-morey\" title=\"\">his </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/07/nba-hong-kong-protests-china-houston-rockets-daryl-morey\" title=\"\">support </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/07/nba-hong-kong-protests-china-houston-rockets-daryl-morey\" title=\"\">for the Hong Kong pro-democracy protests</a>, China\u2019s incensed reaction pushed the league into an international incident. China promised retribution and has acted, most recently refusing to show the opening game of the NBA season.</p> <p>The NBA\u2019s attempts to simultaneously appease China and the US has garnered criticism across the board. The widespread attempts for sporting leagues to capitalise on the capital China possesses has come under greater scrutiny, and there are few sporting bodies navigating China as zealously as the WTA.</p> <p>The saga should be a point of reflection for the WTA, in part because, unlike most other sporting leagues, it is an organisation born out of fighting oppression and the status quo, and its foundations are about much more than just tennis.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/20/andy-murray-european-open-final-stan-wawrinka-tennis\">Tearful Andy Murray wins first singles title since returning from injury</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Taking the big money from a country with an authoritarian government will always come at a cost and presenting its business decision in terms of empowerment is unreasonable as long as Hong Kong burns next door and Uighur Muslims are being sent to re-education camps on the other side of the country.</p> <p>One reason Chinese municipal governments are so willing to collaborate with the WTA is because it is an opportunity to project the best of their cities on to the big stage. Between random beautiful camera shots of the city\u2019s skyline, Shenzhen will showcase an exciting period for the WTA as young players such as Naomi Osaka, Bianca Andreescu and Ashleigh Barty continue to form new rivalries and contest thrilling matches. They may just be thrilling enough for viewers to forget momentarily what is happening 20 miles away and the tanks that lined up in the city weeks earlier. For the city government, that is probably the point.</p> <p>The WTA has unwittingly landed in the middle of the biggest sports politics story of the year, but that was its choice. More stories like this one will unfold over the next weeks, months and years. Questions will be asked of where the WTA stands and how much its money means to it. The organisation will be judged accordingly.</p>",

      "bodyText": "As Hong Kong marched for an 11th consecutive week in August, 20 miles away a drone floated noiselessly over the Shenzhen Bay Sports Centre. It captured coordinated teams of men running across the lush grass-painted lines of a football pitch, but there were no footballs in sight. Instead, dozens of paramilitary vehicles from China\u2019s People\u2019s Armed Police paraded the streets of Shenzhen and settled in the arena. Satellite pictures showed more than 100 sitting tidily around the perimeter of the pitch. The military exercises were widely perceived to be an intimidation tactic, to show what China could do in Hong Kong if it really wanted to. Sports and politics were in perfect harmony. There will be none of those vehicles on show at the Shenzhen Bay Sports Centre. Instead, the eight best women\u2019s tennis players and doubles teams in the world have descended on the complex as the WTA Finals comes to Shenzhen for the first time. Pound for pound, it is essentially the most lucrative tennis event in history \u2013 men\u2019s or women\u2019s. The figures are astonishing: the total prize money stands at $14m (\u00a310.75m), far outstripping the $8m on offer by the ATP\u2019s equivalent event at the O2 Arena in London. If undefeated, the champion will take home $4.725m compared with the record $3.8m pocketed by the US Open champions this year. Steve Simon, the WTA\u2019s CEO, has said: \u201cThere was a true commitment here, trying to do something about \u2018walking the walk\u2019 when it comes to women\u2019s empowerment. It made a huge impression on us when we saw someone who didn\u2019t just talk the talk.\u201d It is clearly a symbolic moment: women being paid more than men, slowly gaining even more access to the money usually reserved for male athletes. Money is always symbolic in women\u2019s tennis because of everything it comes from. Forty\u2011nine years ago, the Women\u2019s Tennis Association was forged partly in the defiant flames of a different era of protests. In We Have Come A Long Way, her 1989 history of women\u2019s tennis, Billie Jean King wrote: \u201cThe issues of the previous decade [the 60s] \u2013 the Vietnam war, racial prejudice, the environment and women\u2019s rights \u2013 were more a part of our consciousness than ever.\u201d In a sport governed from top to bottom by men, female players had long grown accustomed to competing for fractions of the prize money gifted to their male colleagues. Just before the 1970 US Open, the tennis promoter Jack Kramer offered the men prize money of $12,500 and the women $1,500 for the Pacific Southwest Championships in California. Women who failed to reach the quarter-finals would earn nothing but he implored them to play for the love of the game. It was an insult too far. As Kramer threatened to banish them from his US Lawn Tennis Association and their status in other major events came under fire, a group of players led by King risked everything by choosing to boycott his event in favour of forming their own tour. In 1973, the Virginia Slims Circuit made way for the WTA Tour and soon became the machine that now makes millionaires on a monthly basis. On the day the \u201cOriginal Nine\u201d announced that they would boycott Kramer\u2019s event, they signed a contract worth $1 and each held up a dollar bill to the sky. It can be easy to forget just how big women\u2019s tennis is. In an intolerant world where even its greatest player, Serena Williams, still receives scorn for the audacity of being an athlete with muscles, women\u2019s tennis is a triumph. For the past 49 years, it has been the largest women\u2019s sport \u2013 nothing else comes close. On the Forbes list of highest-paid female athletes this year, the top 11 names are tennis players. On and off the court, the WTA has proven capable of generating transcendent superstars and delivering profound cultural moments. None of those moments have been more pivotal to recent WTA history than the rise of Li Na, the charismatic Chinese player who broke away from the centralised tennis system and became a champion. Her triumphs at the French Open in 2011 and the Australian Open in 2014 made small ripples in the west but in China she reshaped the sporting scene in her image. The WTA has since spent more than half a decade pushing hard into China. It now has offices in Beijing and holds nine tournaments in the country, while eight remain in the United States. One day at a Chinese tournament makes it clear why. Their Chinese partners do not think small; with each new event comes a towering new stadium and vast sums from major sponsors to tennis projects stretching far beyond the tournament. While the WTA was in the midst of a mammoth eight weeks in China, the way people speak about the country\u2019s rising presence in world sporting events shifted. When the Houston Rockets general manager, Daryl Morey, tweeted his support for the Hong Kong pro-democracy protests, China\u2019s incensed reaction pushed the league into an international incident. China promised retribution and has acted, most recently refusing to show the opening game of the NBA season. The NBA\u2019s attempts to simultaneously appease China and the US has garnered criticism across the board. The widespread attempts for sporting leagues to capitalise on the capital China possesses has come under greater scrutiny, and there are few sporting bodies navigating China as zealously as the WTA. The saga should be a point of reflection for the WTA, in part because, unlike most other sporting leagues, it is an organisation born out of fighting oppression and the status quo, and its foundations are about much more than just tennis. Taking the big money from a country with an authoritarian government will always come at a cost and presenting its business decision in terms of empowerment is unreasonable as long as Hong Kong burns next door and Uighur Muslims are being sent to re-education camps on the other side of the country. One reason Chinese municipal governments are so willing to collaborate with the WTA is because it is an opportunity to project the best of their cities on to the big stage. Between random beautiful camera shots of the city\u2019s skyline, Shenzhen will showcase an exciting period for the WTA as young players such as Naomi Osaka, Bianca Andreescu and Ashleigh Barty continue to form new rivalries and contest thrilling matches. They may just be thrilling enough for viewers to forget momentarily what is happening 20 miles away and the tanks that lined up in the city weeks earlier. For the city government, that is probably the point. The WTA has unwittingly landed in the middle of the biggest sports politics story of the year, but that was its choice. More stories like this one will unfold over the next weeks, months and years. Questions will be asked of where the WTA stands and how much its money means to it. The organisation will be judged accordingly.",

The currency will be serviced by a collective of companies called the 'Libra Association'. It functions as what is known as a 'stablecoin', pegged to existing assets like the dollar or euro, in the aim of making it less subject to the volatility that many cryptocurrencies experience.</p>\n    <p>The Libra Association is described by Facebook as an independent, not-for-profit organisation based in Switzerland. Within the Libra Association will be a governing body called the Libra Association Council, comprised of a representative of each member of the association, which will vote on policy and operating decisions.</p>\n    <p>Facebook claims that although it created the Libra Association and the Libra Blockchain, once the currency is launched in 2020 the company will withdraw from a leadership role and all members of the association will have equal votes in governance of Libra. The companies who contributed a minimum of $10m(\u00a38m) to be listed as founding members of the Libra Association include tech companies such as PayPal, Ebay, Spotify, Uber and Lyft, as well as financial and venture capital firms such as Andreessen Horowitz, Thrive Capital, Visa and Mastercard.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>However in October 2019 several of the companies that had been backing the initiative <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/11/payment-firms-back-out-in-painful-blow-to-facebooks-cryptocurrency-libra\">announced that they were pulling out</a>, including Visa, Mastercard, PayPal and Stripe.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How and when can I use it?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>With regulators asking questions and backing companies dropping out, it is unclear now if Libra is still viable. Facebook's original plans were that users could download Calibra, a digital wallet, that would allow them to send the currency to anyone with a smartphone. It is no longer clear which countries the coin will launch in first, if at all, though Facebook had said 'almost anybody' in the world with a smartphone would be able to download the app.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/kari-paul\"><b>Kari Paul</b></a>&nbsp;in <i>San Francisco</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Facebook has started to roll out the new ad-checking features to US fact checkers, and the company says it will communicate with international fact checkers before it launches overseas.</p> \n<p>As a result of the lack of communication, some fact checkers only learned that their responsibilities were shortly about to change due to media reports of the new policy around political adverts.

      "body": "<p>In the two years since #MeToo reshaped the public conversation around sexual assault, my friends and I have begun to whisper among ourselves \u2013 what if the exposure of predatory behavior by Harvey Weinstein had not raised our standards for men\u2019s behavior, but actually lowered them? After all, Weinstein was routinely held up as an example of what kind of sexual abuse was unacceptable, but not in such a way that acknowledged the prevalence of his sort of exploitation and abuse of power, but in a way that seemed to suggest that anything short of his level of high-profile, organized, serial rape and assault wasn\u2019t really so bad.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s no Harvey Weinstein,\u201d we were told of the men who \u201cmerely\u201d harassed, or \u201cmerely\u201d groped. \u201cHe\u2019s not <em>that </em>bad.\u201d How bad does he have to be to be worth talking about? The threshold kept rising. \u201cThere is a difference between a Harvey Weinstein and an Aziz Ansari,\u201d we were repeatedly warned by critics of the #MeToo movement, and yes, there is. But the implication seemed to be not that there was a difference in the quality of the harm these men did, or a difference in the ways we should seek justice for the women they hurt. The difference, these critics seemed to imply, was between what women could reasonably complain about and what they should be expected to just shut up and endure.</p> <p>I thought, in other words, that the forces of misogyny were willing to make Harvey Weinstein something a sacrificial lamb, a man they were willing to concede was an abuser, so long as they could also maintain that none of the innumerable less brazen or egregious offenses other men commit are worthy of censure. I thought that they were willing to concede, at least, that a man of incredible power who allegedly used that power to coerce and force sex from dozens of unconsenting women was unacceptable, that he should not be welcome in the community. I was wrong.</p> <p>I was proved wrong on Thursday night, when Harvey Weinstein, still a free and very rich man, made an appearance at a club called the Downtime Bar, on Manhattan\u2019s Lower East Side. He was there to see the club\u2019s monthly showcase for young talent, Actor\u2019s Hour, and he arrived with an entourage, sitting in a prime booth to watch the set. Understandably, performers were uncomfortable with his presence. \u201cI didn\u2019t know we had to bring our own mace and rape whistles to actor\u2019s hour,\u201d joked the comedian Kelly Bachman during her set. In <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B3-0I45JgSw/\">a video</a> of her performance, men\u2019s voices can immediately be heard booing her once she voices discomfort with Weinstein\u2019s presence. \u201cShut up!\u201d one yells. \u201cShut up,\u201d Bachman replies. \u201cReally? This kills at group therapy for rape survivors.\u201d At intermission, according to witnesses, a weeping woman in the audience complained about Weinstein\u2019s presence. She was thrown out.</p> <p>Weinstein\u2019s presence at the Downtime Bar is the latest in a string of increasingly brazen returns to public life by men who were credibly and multiply accused of sexual assault during the #MeToo era. Louis CK is performing again, sometimes showing up, like Weinstein, unannounced, surprising women club goers who then have to decide between enduring the discomfort of being in his presence and sacrificing the price of their ticket. Aziz Ansari just put out a comedy special in which he decries \u201cwokeness\u201d and \u201ccancel culture\u201d and implies that he considers himself a victim. Al Franken, fresh on the heels of the revelation that a ninth woman has accused him of groping her, has been booked for an appearance at this weekend\u2019s <a href=\"https://politicon.com/speaker/al-franken/\">Politicon conference</a> in Nashville.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Matt Lauer, the former news host who is alleged to have kept a button under his desk to lock unwilling women inside his office, recently gave an off the record interview to Jeff Zeigler of Mediate, his first since being fired over assault and harassment allegations from NBC. The resulting podcast, which came on the heels of a new rape allegation against Lauer in Ronan Farrow\u2019s book Catch and Kill, was defensive and even laudatory of Lauer, with Zeigler joining Glenn Beck to declare that Lauer is innocent of the allegations against and has not had a chance to tell his side of the story. In fact Lauer has already told his story to quite a large audience, having published his response to Farrow\u2019s reporting in a lengthy letter that was printed by Variety, a national media outlet.</p> <p>Critics of the #MeToo movement have described being accused of sexual assault as akin to summary execution for a man, and have loudly bemoaned men\u2019s ruined careers and social deaths. But these men are not dead. They are very much still alive, and in many cases they are still working. They will not go away, and they seem unwilling, even, to stop demanding our attention, stop showing up uninvited in our newsfeeds, on our television screens, and in the comedy bars where we go to have a laugh and relax. We\u2019re told they\u2019re dead, but they keep appearing everywhere, still here and still very much capable of inflicting further harm. In the set that got her booed at the Downtime Bar, Bachman compared Weinstein to the horror villain Freddy Krueger, and in his zombielike ability to reemerge and torment women where they expect to be at ease, this comparison seems particularly apt.</p> <p>Really, that these men would attempt to make a comeback after their abuses were exposed is not very surprising. We already know that they are vain, entitled, lacking in self awareness and largely impervious to shame \u2013 after all, these are the qualities that allowed them to abuse women in the first place. What is surprising, instead, is how readily they\u2019ve been welcomed.</p> <p>In her set addressing Weinstein\u2019s presence, Bachman spoke of being a rape survivor, and in the video, female voices can be heard cheering her. But the men in the room had already booed, expressing not only support for Weinstein but hostility toward the woman who said his behavior should be enough to exclude him from polite society. Even Weinstein, the man who it seemed even the #MeToo movement\u2019s most committed antagonists were willing to concede was a monster, had allies in that room, allies who were not afraid to side with a monster against a woman who wanted to stand up for herself. Maybe feminists like me and my friends were wrong to think that even Weinstein\u2019s behavior could be condemned as too hurtful to be tolerated. For this culture\u2019s hatred of women, there is no bottom.</p> <ul> <li><p>Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnist</p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "In the two years since #MeToo reshaped the public conversation around sexual assault, my friends and I have begun to whisper among ourselves \u2013 what if the exposure of predatory behavior by Harvey Weinstein had not raised our standards for men\u2019s behavior, but actually lowered them? After all, Weinstein was routinely held up as an example of what kind of sexual abuse was unacceptable, but not in such a way that acknowledged the prevalence of his sort of exploitation and abuse of power, but in a way that seemed to suggest that anything short of his level of high-profile, organized, serial rape and assault wasn\u2019t really so bad. \u201cHe\u2019s no Harvey Weinstein,\u201d we were told of the men who \u201cmerely\u201d harassed, or \u201cmerely\u201d groped. \u201cHe\u2019s not that bad.\u201d How bad does he have to be to be worth talking about? The threshold kept rising. \u201cThere is a difference between a Harvey Weinstein and an Aziz Ansari,\u201d we were repeatedly warned by critics of the #MeToo movement, and yes, there is. But the implication seemed to be not that there was a difference in the quality of the harm these men did, or a difference in the ways we should seek justice for the women they hurt. The difference, these critics seemed to imply, was between what women could reasonably complain about and what they should be expected to just shut up and endure. I thought, in other words, that the forces of misogyny were willing to make Harvey Weinstein something a sacrificial lamb, a man they were willing to concede was an abuser, so long as they could also maintain that none of the innumerable less brazen or egregious offenses other men commit are worthy of censure. I thought that they were willing to concede, at least, that a man of incredible power who allegedly used that power to coerce and force sex from dozens of unconsenting women was unacceptable, that he should not be welcome in the community. I was wrong. I was proved wrong on Thursday night, when Harvey Weinstein, still a free and very rich man, made an appearance at a club called the Downtime Bar, on Manhattan\u2019s Lower East Side. He was there to see the club\u2019s monthly showcase for young talent, Actor\u2019s Hour, and he arrived with an entourage, sitting in a prime booth to watch the set. Understandably, performers were uncomfortable with his presence. \u201cI didn\u2019t know we had to bring our own mace and rape whistles to actor\u2019s hour,\u201d joked the comedian Kelly Bachman during her set. In a video of her performance, men\u2019s voices can immediately be heard booing her once she voices discomfort with Weinstein\u2019s presence. \u201cShut up!\u201d one yells. \u201cShut up,\u201d Bachman replies. \u201cReally? This kills at group therapy for rape survivors.\u201d At intermission, according to witnesses, a weeping woman in the audience complained about Weinstein\u2019s presence. She was thrown out. Weinstein\u2019s presence at the Downtime Bar is the latest in a string of increasingly brazen returns to public life by men who were credibly and multiply accused of sexual assault during the #MeToo era. Louis CK is performing again, sometimes showing up, like Weinstein, unannounced, surprising women club goers who then have to decide between enduring the discomfort of being in his presence and sacrificing the price of their ticket. Aziz Ansari just put out a comedy special in which he decries \u201cwokeness\u201d and \u201ccancel culture\u201d and implies that he considers himself a victim. Al Franken, fresh on the heels of the revelation that a ninth woman has accused him of groping her, has been booked for an appearance at this weekend\u2019s Politicon conference in Nashville. Meanwhile, Matt Lauer, the former news host who is alleged to have kept a button under his desk to lock unwilling women inside his office, recently gave an off the record interview to Jeff Zeigler of Mediate, his first since being fired over assault and harassment allegations from NBC. The resulting podcast, which came on the heels of a new rape allegation against Lauer in Ronan Farrow\u2019s book Catch and Kill, was defensive and even laudatory of Lauer, with Zeigler joining Glenn Beck to declare that Lauer is innocent of the allegations against and has not had a chance to tell his side of the story. In fact Lauer has already told his story to quite a large audience, having published his response to Farrow\u2019s reporting in a lengthy letter that was printed by Variety, a national media outlet. Critics of the #MeToo movement have described being accused of sexual assault as akin to summary execution for a man, and have loudly bemoaned men\u2019s ruined careers and social deaths. But these men are not dead. They are very much still alive, and in many cases they are still working. They will not go away, and they seem unwilling, even, to stop demanding our attention, stop showing up uninvited in our newsfeeds, on our television screens, and in the comedy bars where we go to have a laugh and relax. We\u2019re told they\u2019re dead, but they keep appearing everywhere, still here and still very much capable of inflicting further harm. In the set that got her booed at the Downtime Bar, Bachman compared Weinstein to the horror villain Freddy Krueger, and in his zombielike ability to reemerge and torment women where they expect to be at ease, this comparison seems particularly apt. Really, that these men would attempt to make a comeback after their abuses were exposed is not very surprising. We already know that they are vain, entitled, lacking in self awareness and largely impervious to shame \u2013 after all, these are the qualities that allowed them to abuse women in the first place. What is surprising, instead, is how readily they\u2019ve been welcomed. In her set addressing Weinstein\u2019s presence, Bachman spoke of being a rape survivor, and in the video, female voices can be heard cheering her. But the men in the room had already booed, expressing not only support for Weinstein but hostility toward the woman who said his behavior should be enough to exclude him from polite society. Even Weinstein, the man who it seemed even the #MeToo movement\u2019s most committed antagonists were willing to concede was a monster, had allies in that room, allies who were not afraid to side with a monster against a woman who wanted to stand up for herself. Maybe feminists like me and my friends were wrong to think that even Weinstein\u2019s behavior could be condemned as too hurtful to be tolerated. For this culture\u2019s hatred of women, there is no bottom. Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnist",

Flying less and eating less meat and dairy also make big cuts in your impact, as does driving fewer petrol-powered miles and insulating your home.</p> <p><strong>How can we build on the urgency we\u2019ve seen from many campaigners in 2019 and keep the spotlight fixed firmly on the big changes we need?</strong><br><br>We are in a race against time and it\u2019s not at all certain that we are going to win.

Prograis and Taylor are both unbeaten world champions in the super-lightweight division and their unification contest at the O<sub>2</sub> Arena should be riveting.</p> <p>I interviewed both men last week and they offer an intriguing study in contrast. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/21/josh-taylor-boxing-interview\" title=\"\">Taylor, a 28-year-old Scot who lives just outside Edinburgh</a>, is likable yet concentrated in his searing focus on Prograis, while also revealing a passion for motorbike racing. The 30-year-old Prograis, meanwhile, is erudite and laconic. He discusses books and history, poverty and morality. In London he has visited the Churchill War Rooms and plans were made for him to meet the historian Andrew Roberts. An unlikely encounter between a heavily tattooed American boxer and Churchill\u2019s biographer didn\u2019t happen this time but it\u2019s an example of Prograis\u2019s difference to most fighters.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/21/josh-taylor-boxing-interview\">Josh Taylor: \u2018I was always smaller than everyone \u2026 I would fight them straight away\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Prograis and I have emailed each other regularly over the past few months and I have been sending him a stream of books which he has read and written about in interesting ways. His desire to read, and to one day write a book himself, is at the heart of our exchange. Prograis also highlights his voracious appetite for reading as one of the reasons why he will handle the unsettling intensity of this fight.</p> <p>\u201cI love reading about the psychology and history of boxing,\u201d Prograis says. \u201cHaving read so much about intimidation it seems to me that Taylor is more intimidated than I am. If you look at his body language, you can see it. He\u2019s very intense. I\u2019m so cool. I\u2019m collected. You can\u2019t bother me. When I told him: \u2018You try to look at me all mean, but that don\u2019t matter,\u2019 I think it bothered him. He is used to being an intimidator at this weight [140lb] because he\u2019s so tall and with a long reach. I can see how he could intimidate some people. But I come to him with a lot of knowledge, a lot of skill and a lot of power.\u201d</p> <p>Prograis looks strong but he smiles when I mention the size difference between him and Taylor. \u201cI always fought bigger people. It comes easy to me. I told Taylor straight: \u2018Even if you have all those advantages, you still can\u2019t beat me. You can be stronger, you can be faster, you can hit harder, you\u2019re obviously taller and you got the longer reach. That doesn\u2019t matter. None of that stuff wins the fight.\u2019 It comes down to skill and will. He is talking much more angrily that I am. I think that was because, when the fight got postponed while I sorted out my contract, he was convinced I was scared of him. That was never was the case. It was about the money.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"28cf8b2c1c70006830728206a49a06e7ad156141\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/28cf8b2c1c70006830728206a49a06e7ad156141/0_132_2415_3368/717.jpg\" alt=\"Regis Prograis takes on Josh Taylor at the O2 on Saturday evening.\" width=\"717\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Regis Prograis takes on Josh Taylor at the O2 on Saturday evening.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Couldridge/Action Images via Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cNow he might be a little worried because I\u2019ve been here three weeks.

I am ready and I am not scared of him one bit. It\u2019s understandable that he should be more worried than me.\u201d</p> <p>Prograis, who is from New Orleans, talks in a relaxed drawl which hides the menace of a fighter who has knocked out 80% of his opponents. Does he feel any animosity towards Taylor, who has spoken of how Prograis will \u201c<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/boxing/50156104\" title=\"\">get chinned in a dog fight</a>\u201d? He shakes his head: \u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>Does it help a fighter if he is driven by resentment or dislike of his rival? \u201cNot for me. I always fight calm. You want to hurt the opponent, of course, but I never think of damaging him. So I don\u2019t have to be mad at them. For me, fighting is just something I love to do.\u201d</p> <p>Fourteen years ago, in August 2005, Prograis\u2019s life changed for ever when his family home and much of New Orleans was devastated by Hurricane Katrina. His family lost everything and he had to start a new life in Houston \u2013 where boxing became his salvation. \u201cEveryone wants me to say Katrina was hard,\u201d Prograis suggests. \u201cI was 16 so it definitely forced me to grow up early. Looking back, it was the best thing that ever happened to me. It\u2019s hard for me to look at it as a bad thing because so much good came out of it. It changed my life for the better.</p> <p>\u201cBut, at the time, it was a shock. It was like: \u2018You were here in New Orleans, your life was like this and that\u2019s it. That life is gone for ever. Wiped away.\u2019 You can type in your zip code and see your area. We did it because we were seeing all the hurricane stuff on the news. We were seeing water drowning the city. But we didn\u2019t know if our exact location was full of water. So we typed in the zip code and our house was like a lake. Our whole neighbourhood was under water. Where I lived in New Orleans was right next to a lake and you couldn\u2019t tell the difference. I knew we\u2019re never going back there again.</p> <p>\u201cFor me and my sister it was fun because we were out of school. It was like vacation. We were used to hurricane season every year and the warnings to evacuate. You got to put tape on your windows, fill your gas tanks up, get water. Then nothing happens. You might get a tree knocked over. That happened a few times over the years but this was different. The mayor was on the news and he said: \u2018It\u2019s gonna be like Hurricane Betsy.\u2019 When Hurricane Betsy happened [in 1965] my grandma remembers her and her daddy getting around in boats. She said: \u2018If it\u2019s going to be like that, we gotta go.\u2019 That\u2019s why we left the day before Katrina.\u201d</p> <p>His New Orleans roots still run deep. \u201cIt\u2019s home,\u201d Prograis says simply. \u201cWhere I come from, the people around you determine your success. Of course we all want money. When I was young I always looked at rich people and thought: \u2018I wanna have those things.\u2019 Katrina took away everything we had, and we did not have much, but as I get older I realise it\u2019s the people that matter. It\u2019s the relationships you have, the love you have.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI once looked at my grandparents as being unsuccessful. They had nothing. They were always real poor. She was a maid for 25 years. When we used to leave for school we would drop her off \u2013 at the house she used to clean. My grandpa worked two jobs for 40 years. He was a janitor and he worked on the garbage truck. At first you think those are not good careers. But if you look at my grandma and grandpa, they succeeded in life because everybody loves them. My grandma calls everybody every day. She talks to everybody. That\u2019s just how she is. I\u2019m a fighter but I try to be like that because it\u2019s the right way.\u201d</p> <p>Prograis had started boxing in New Orleans a few months before Katrina but when his family moved to Houston he embraced this dark old trade. Boxing and books soon became the cornerstones of his new life. \u201cBecause I started boxing late I was at a disadvantage. I had to catch up. And, for me, catching up was reading and studying. Everybody works hard in the gym. But you got to think about what\u2019s outside the gym. When you done training, what\u2019s going to be the difference? For me, it\u2019s your mind.</p> <p>\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jan/24/mike-tyson-interview-pain-escape-violent-past\" title=\"\">I learned that Mike Tyson was a student of the game</a>. I thought: \u2018I wanna do that.\u2019 So I just watched thousands of fights. Almost all the greatest fighters you can name, I watched all their fights from their pro debut to their last bout. I also started reading. I read about someone who was trying to go to the Olympics and they substituted TV for books. At one time I was probably watching five hours of TV a day. I was like: \u2018Damn, imagine if I read that much. Imagine how much I will know.\u2019 I started doing that. Of course I don\u2019t read as much as I used to because I got two kids and I\u2019m busy now. But when I first started, I was reading six, seven hours a day. Read, read, read.

      "bodyText": "\u201cIf I didn\u2019t read as much as I did, and study the history, I\u2019d probably be intimidated by this fight and by Josh Taylor,\u201d Regis Prograis says as he faces the dangerous ordeal that awaits him and his opponent on Saturday night. Prograis and Taylor are both unbeaten world champions in the super-lightweight division and their unification contest at the O2 Arena should be riveting. I interviewed both men last week and they offer an intriguing study in contrast. Taylor, a 28-year-old Scot who lives just outside Edinburgh, is likable yet concentrated in his searing focus on Prograis, while also revealing a passion for motorbike racing. The 30-year-old Prograis, meanwhile, is erudite and laconic. He discusses books and history, poverty and morality. In London he has visited the Churchill War Rooms and plans were made for him to meet the historian Andrew Roberts. An unlikely encounter between a heavily tattooed American boxer and Churchill\u2019s biographer didn\u2019t happen this time but it\u2019s an example of Prograis\u2019s difference to most fighters. Prograis and I have emailed each other regularly over the past few months and I have been sending him a stream of books which he has read and written about in interesting ways. His desire to read, and to one day write a book himself, is at the heart of our exchange. Prograis also highlights his voracious appetite for reading as one of the reasons why he will handle the unsettling intensity of this fight. \u201cI love reading about the psychology and history of boxing,\u201d Prograis says. \u201cHaving read so much about intimidation it seems to me that Taylor is more intimidated than I am. If you look at his body language, you can see it. He\u2019s very intense. I\u2019m so cool. I\u2019m collected. You can\u2019t bother me. When I told him: \u2018You try to look at me all mean, but that don\u2019t matter,\u2019 I think it bothered him. He is used to being an intimidator at this weight [140lb] because he\u2019s so tall and with a long reach. I can see how he could intimidate some people. But I come to him with a lot of knowledge, a lot of skill and a lot of power.\u201d Prograis looks strong but he smiles when I mention the size difference between him and Taylor. \u201cI always fought bigger people. It comes easy to me. I told Taylor straight: \u2018Even if you have all those advantages, you still can\u2019t beat me. You can be stronger, you can be faster, you can hit harder, you\u2019re obviously taller and you got the longer reach. That doesn\u2019t matter. None of that stuff wins the fight.\u2019 It comes down to skill and will. He is talking much more angrily that I am. I think that was because, when the fight got postponed while I sorted out my contract, he was convinced I was scared of him. That was never was the case. It was about the money. \u201cNow he might be a little worried because I\u2019ve been here three weeks. I came over early to be well-adjusted to the weather, the people, the food, the time difference, everything. He sees now I am really serious. It\u2019s not a game. I am ready and I am not scared of him one bit. It\u2019s understandable that he should be more worried than me.\u201d Prograis, who is from New Orleans, talks in a relaxed drawl which hides the menace of a fighter who has knocked out 80% of his opponents. Does he feel any animosity towards Taylor, who has spoken of how Prograis will \u201cget chinned in a dog fight\u201d? He shakes his head: \u201cNo.\u201d Does it help a fighter if he is driven by resentment or dislike of his rival? \u201cNot for me. I always fight calm. You want to hurt the opponent, of course, but I never think of damaging him. So I don\u2019t have to be mad at them. For me, fighting is just something I love to do.\u201d Fourteen years ago, in August 2005, Prograis\u2019s life changed for ever when his family home and much of New Orleans was devastated by Hurricane Katrina.

      "body": "<p>Halloween is nearly upon us, and if it still feels like a bit of a false festival in Britain \u2013 where the silly rigours of trick-or-treating and pumpkin carving seem a long way from becoming standard \u2013 a horror-movie marathon remains the best and easiest way to acknowledge its existence. The increased chill in the air, the sudden earlier onset of darkness: all ideal conditions for snuggling down with red wine and something a bit jumpy and blood-freezing to watch.</p> <p>Most streaming services attempt to capitalise on this seasonal shift in some way or another, though some do it better than others. Unless you\u2019re a diehard fan of Netflix\u2019s <strong>Riverdale</strong> \u2013 a lightly spooked-out update of the <a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/ba/PepComics36a.jpg\" title=\"\">Archie comics</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/watch/80133268\" title=\"\">fourth series</a> of which began this month \u2013 the streaming giant\u2019s scary-season offerings aren\u2019t the best. Their glossiest horror premiere for October is <strong>Wounds</strong>, a Sundance-acquired US debut for the British-Iranian director Babak Anvari, and a bit of a disappointment following his elegant, Tehran-set chiller <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jan/22/dvd-review-under-the-shadow-blair-witch-magnificent-seven-review\" title=\"\">Under the Shadow</a></em>.</p> <p>Its story of a New Orleans bartender (Armie Hammer) pulled into a grotesque occult dimension via a customer\u2019s left-behind mobile lands a few neat jolts, and builds to a genuinely eye-scarring climax. Yet despite a faintly solemn depiction of alcoholism, it\u2019s a shallow stunt, short on human feeling or meaning. It\u2019ll start your marathon with a suitable shiver, but if you\u2019ve never seen <em>Under the Shadow</em> \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/watch/80096786\" title=\"\">also streaming on Netflix</a>, conveniently enough \u2013 that\u2019s the better bet.</p> <p>Over to Shudder, the dedicated all-horror streaming service, which you\u2019d expect to have a little more to offer. Sure enough, landing <a href=\"https://www.shudder.com/movies/exclusive-original/Exclusive%20&amp;%20Original\" title=\"\">on </a><a href=\"https://www.shudder.com/movies/exclusive-original/Exclusive%20&amp;%20Original\" title=\"\">its menu</a> this week is ideal Halloween-party fodder: <strong>Nightmare Cinema</strong>, a nifty new anthology film with a lot of fast style and a lot of easy scares, only a few of which will linger in your brain afterwards. It comprises five shorts, each about 20 minutes long, bound by a tenuous framing device with Mickey Rourke as a creepy cinema projectionist.</p> <p><em>Gremlins</em> veteran Joe Dante is the star attraction here for horror geeks, and his plastic-surgery themed short <em>Mirare</em> is a fun diversion. The pick of the bunch, however, comes from British director David Slade (<em>Hard Candy</em>), whose <em>This Way to Egress</em>, about a woman gradually losing her grip on reality in a doctor\u2019s waiting room, has sharp, skin-crawling staying power. Slade has directed a few episodes of <em>Black Mirror</em>, and this plays like an exceptional one.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3STondh5fE0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3STondh5fE0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3STondh5fE0\">Watch a trailer for Nightmare Cinema.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>If your horror tastes veer more classic or arthouse, Mubi has you covered: their Celebration of Horror season currently includes Michael Powell\u2019s <strong>Peeping Tom</strong> and a <a href=\"https://mubi.com/specials/del-toro\" title=\"\">Guillermo </a><a href=\"https://mubi.com/specials/del-toro\" title=\"\">del Toro double bill</a> of <strong>Pan\u2019s Labyrinth</strong> and the gorgeous, visceral ghost story<strong> The Devil\u2019s Backbone</strong> (still my preferred of the two), with <strong>The Bird</strong> set to descend on All Hallows\u2019 Eve itself. Fresh from the London film festival, they also have Bertrand Bonello\u2019s fascinating, politically inflamed, Haiti-set shapeshifter <strong><a href=\"https://mubi.com/films/zombi-child\" title=\"\">Zombi Child</a></strong>: its twisting of zombie-film tropes as a metaphor for postcolonial trauma may be a bit lateral for some Halloween marathons, but it\u2019s a must-see on any day.</p> <p>Finally, Ari Aster\u2019s extraordinary <strong>Midsommar</strong> (Entertainment, 18) hits DVD and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Midsommar-Florence-Pugh/dp/B07YRH734K/ref=sr_1_3?crid=3CYWQQX8IA9GM&amp;keywords=midsommar+directors+cut&amp;qid=1571663290&amp;sprefix=midsommar+direc%2Caps%2C140&amp;sr=8-3\" title=\"\">VOD</a> just in time for the big day.

      "bodyText": "Halloween is nearly upon us, and if it still feels like a bit of a false festival in Britain \u2013 where the silly rigours of trick-or-treating and pumpkin carving seem a long way from becoming standard \u2013 a horror-movie marathon remains the best and easiest way to acknowledge its existence. The increased chill in the air, the sudden earlier onset of darkness: all ideal conditions for snuggling down with red wine and something a bit jumpy and blood-freezing to watch. Most streaming services attempt to capitalise on this seasonal shift in some way or another, though some do it better than others. Unless you\u2019re a diehard fan of Netflix\u2019s Riverdale \u2013 a lightly spooked-out update of the Archie comics, the fourth series of which began this month \u2013 the streaming giant\u2019s scary-season offerings aren\u2019t the best. Their glossiest horror premiere for October is Wounds, a Sundance-acquired US debut for the British-Iranian director Babak Anvari, and a bit of a disappointment following his elegant, Tehran-set chiller Under the Shadow. Its story of a New Orleans bartender (Armie Hammer) pulled into a grotesque occult dimension via a customer\u2019s left-behind mobile lands a few neat jolts, and builds to a genuinely eye-scarring climax. Yet despite a faintly solemn depiction of alcoholism, it\u2019s a shallow stunt, short on human feeling or meaning. It\u2019ll start your marathon with a suitable shiver, but if you\u2019ve never seen Under the Shadow \u2013 also streaming on Netflix, conveniently enough \u2013 that\u2019s the better bet. Over to Shudder, the dedicated all-horror streaming service, which you\u2019d expect to have a little more to offer. Sure enough, landing on its menu this week is ideal Halloween-party fodder: Nightmare Cinema, a nifty new anthology film with a lot of fast style and a lot of easy scares, only a few of which will linger in your brain afterwards. It comprises five shorts, each about 20 minutes long, bound by a tenuous framing device with Mickey Rourke as a creepy cinema projectionist. Gremlins veteran Joe Dante is the star attraction here for horror geeks, and his plastic-surgery themed short Mirare is a fun diversion. The pick of the bunch, however, comes from British director David Slade (Hard Candy), whose This Way to Egress, about a woman gradually losing her grip on reality in a doctor\u2019s waiting room, has sharp, skin-crawling staying power. Slade has directed a few episodes of Black Mirror, and this plays like an exceptional one. If your horror tastes veer more classic or arthouse, Mubi has you covered: their Celebration of Horror season currently includes Michael Powell\u2019s Peeping Tom and a Guillermo del Toro double bill of Pan\u2019s Labyrinth and the gorgeous, visceral ghost story The Devil\u2019s Backbone (still my preferred of the two), with The Bird set to descend on All Hallows\u2019 Eve itself. Fresh from the London film festival, they also have Bertrand Bonello\u2019s fascinating, politically inflamed, Haiti-set shapeshifter Zombi Child: its twisting of zombie-film tropes as a metaphor for postcolonial trauma may be a bit lateral for some Halloween marathons, but it\u2019s a must-see on any day. Finally, Ari Aster\u2019s extraordinary Midsommar (Entertainment, 18) hits DVD and VOD just in time for the big day. Beginning with its title, it doesn\u2019t quite match the seasonal conditions I described at the top of this column: it\u2019s high-heat horror, played out almost entirely in glaring, punishing sunlight. Following a group of American students on a trip to observe an outwardly wholesome Scandi summer festival, its terrifying subversion of folk ritual, as the group splinters, prompted multiple Wicker Man comparisons, but there are dark adult echoes of Alice in Wonderland and The Wizard of Oz in its bright, strange stew. If you caught it at the cinema, the three-hour director\u2019s cut is also getting a release: prepare to be unsettled and surprised afresh. Also new to streaming and DVD this week The Before Trilogy (Criterion, 15) Richard Linklater\u2019s decades-spanning trilogy of walking-and-talking romances gets richer and more resonant with age. This gorgeous Criterion box set will be on a many a cinephile\u2019s Christmas wishlist. Vita and Virginia (Thunderbird, 12) Director Chanya Button\u2019s distinctive take on the romance between Virginia Woolf and Vita Sackville-West doesn\u2019t pull off all its modernist flourishes, but Elizabeth Debicki is a brilliant, otherworldly Woolf. A Good Woman Is Hard to Find (Signature, 18) A riveting performance by Sarah Bolger as a widowed Belfast mother accidentally entangled in grisly underworld dealings keeps Abner Pastoll\u2019s blackly comic thriller on course, even as its tone lurches. Photograph (Curzon Artificial Eye, 15) After a stint in starry English-language cinema, Indian director Ritesh Batra returns to the terrain of The Lunchbox with this slow-paced but sweet-natured cross-class romance, set vibrantly in Mumbai.",

      "body": "<p>When he was a teenager growing up in Phoenix, Maryland, Dan Piepenbring would often head to Walmart to check out the new release CDs. It was 1999 and the height of rap rock and nu metal, of Limp Bizkit and Korn, of hirsute man-boys with snapback hats and chain wallets. Piepenbring\u2019s curiosity was aroused by something else \u2013 a record called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYjAR0JD5nw\" title=\"\">Rave Un2 The Joy Fantastic</a>. \u201cThe singer was wearing a blue shiny outfit,\u201d he recalls. \u201cNot quite superhuman, but extraterrestrial. He had no name and looked so effeminate. He seemed to be of indeterminate ethnic origin. And I was a little afraid. He just seemed so weird. I remember handling the CD on successive visits to the store and thinking, \u2018What is this?\u2019 It was so gloriously out of sync with everything else on the shelves.\u201d</p> <p>That was Piepenbring\u2019s first encounter with Prince. In 2004, he listened to Purple Rain and was smitten. \u201cI became obsessed,\u201d he says over hamburger and fries in a Greenwich Village bar. Now 33, he has the underfed eloquence of the eternal postgrad. \u201cI had this sense that I was listening to someone who combined so many fascinating strains of popular music, from the last 50 years, in an original package.\u201d In 2016, Piepenbring was working as an editor at the New York-based literary journal Paris Review, when his agent told him Prince was searching for a co-writer to work on his memoir. He turned in a pitch-cum-love-letter: \u201cFrom my first encounter with Prince I knew he was a master storyteller,\u201d he wrote. \u201cTo help him tell his stories in a new mode would be a once-in-a-lifetime honour.\u201d</p> <p>Less than a day later, he was summoned to meet the singer at his Paisley Park complex in Minnesota. He got the assignment. What followed he describes as a \u201cbizarre, three-month detour in my life, a strange and voluptuous period. And so surreal.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Piepenbring and Prince went to concerts, parties and a private screening of Kung Fu Panda 3 together</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Piepenbring was a surprising choice, being all the things Prince was not: white, young, college-educated, outside the musical world, completely unknown. But Prince was famously secretive about his life, as well as dismissive of interviewers. He described writers as \u201cmamma-jammas wearing glasses and an alligator shirt behind a typewriter\u201d and claimed, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing a critic can tell me that I can learn from.\u201d Piepenbring remembers him saying that he regarded most of what had been written about him as \u201cgarbage\u201d. The Paris Review is best known for its extended interviews with authors, but this did not stop the young editor becoming Prince\u2019s amenuensis. \u201cMy first Monday coming back from Paisley Park, we gave over the weekly staff meeting to having me retell the story of that weekend. Then I was like: if any of this gets out I will never get this job!\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ba2d9ca5be3a81119847ab303787a733480133ac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ba2d9ca5be3a81119847ab303787a733480133ac/112_323_1603_2098/764.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Hey, did you know that too much sex makes your hair grow?\u2019; a high school comic strip stored at Paisley Park.\" width=\"764\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Hey, did you know that too much sex makes your hair grow?\u2019; a high school comic strip stored at Paisley Park.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Copyright The Prince Estate</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Over the next few weeks, Piepenbring and Prince went to concerts, parties and a private screening of Kung Fu Panda 3 together. They had conversations over the phone and in Prince\u2019s black Lincoln MKT (his driving, particularly his turn signalling, was excellent). The singer mentioned how at high school he\u2019d punched a kid who\u2019d thrown a racial slur at him \u2013 and that his best friend growing up was Jewish. He spoke about the death of an early love \u2013 the singer Vanity. \u201cHe had a great, deadpan and warm sense of humour. I was surprised by his autonomy and his ability to put people around him, including me, at ease.\u201d</p> <p>The writer flew to Australia where Prince, who was checking into hotels under the name Peter Bravestrong, discussed with him his ideas for the book. \u201cIs it about the music industry? His parents? A handbook for the black community? His ideas could change in the course of a single conversation. I don\u2019t know which one he would have settled on,\u201d he says.</p> <p>A degree of trust had been established \u2013 Prince referred to Piepenbring as \u201cmy brother Dan\u201d \u2013 and the singer talked of having the pair\u2019s distinct voices merge over the course of the narrative. Thinking back to the epilepsy he suffered as a child, Prince suggested, \u201cWe could use seizures as a way of blending our voices. Blackouts.\u201d I tell Piepenbring this sounds more like avant-garde fiction than a traditional rock memoir. \u201cWhich I was so looking forward to! The fact that he wanted to produce something so formalist and postmodern and strange was the most surprising thing. Especially because, at this point in his career, he was writing songs in various generic modes rather than, as he did in the 1980s, shattering those modes. But what a burden! There\u2019s no guarantee it would have been readable, or necessarily true to what he had imagined.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e715685ed08e6175b49c16716de1687043ed7369\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e715685ed08e6175b49c16716de1687043ed7369/152_327_1553_2059/754.jpg\" alt=\"One of a series of shots Prince took in the bathroom mirror of a rented house in the Hollywood Hills, Los Angeles, 1978\" width=\"754\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of a series of shots Prince took in the bathroom mirror of a rented house in the Hollywood Hills, Los Angeles, 1978.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Copyright The Prince Estate</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On 21 April, barely three months after they had started collaborating, Prince\u2019s death was announced; he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/mar/27/prince-had-exceedingly-high-level-of-fentanyl-in-body-when-he-died\" title=\"\">had overdosed on fentanyl</a>. The last time the two men had spoken was four days earlier, when Prince had phoned, talked a lot about his parents\u2019 influence on his life, ending: \u201cI just wanted to call and let you know that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been thinking about.

There was no real method to the madness. In one room you\u2019d find something from 1979, and within arm\u2019s reach there\u2019d be something from 2002. There\u2019d be these moments of intense intentionality \u2013 he\u2019d gathered up all his handwritten lyrics from across his career, clipped them together, and kept them in one place. Or he\u2019d gathered artefacts pertaining to his father\u2019s jazz band. It seemed very ad hoc and very personal.\u201d</p> <p>The estate, which is currently run from the Carver County courts in Minnesota, limited access to the physical vault, pre-curating the material by digitising sections of the archive, which were uploaded on to a dedicated site from which Piepenbring selected material. So he hasn\u2019t seen everything. \u201cIt\u2019s Rumsfeldian,\u201d he laughs. \u201cThere are known unknowns, and there are unknown unknowns.\u201d Still, responding to some of the words Prince repeatedly came back to during their conversations (freedom, creativity, community) he has fashioned a riveting anthology that includes many unseen photographs of Prince as a teenager, handwritten lyrics, and photographic contact sheets that illuminate the creative guile the singer put into finessing the persona that shocked and seduced the general public.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>They keep trying to ram Katy Perry and Ed Sheeran down our throats, and we don\u2019t like it,\" Prince wrote</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThere are thousands of staged photoshoots of Prince,\u201d Piepenbring observes. \u201cI wanted things that gave me the same frisson as when we met. I could hardly believe I was seeing a mirror selfie of Prince. And that he went on taking them through his life \u2013 almost as a way of checking in on himself. I also love that photo of him with a guitar: it\u2019s the two objects that most readily come to mind when you think of Prince \u2013 guitar and bed \u2013 in a perfect combination of virtuosity and intimacy. He\u2019s got this very intense but abstract and insouciant look on his face. He seems almost lost in thought, and there\u2019s a bit of melancholy in there, too. It\u2019s such a lovely image.\u201d Asked why he has included so few photos from after 1986 in the book, Piepenbring argues not that Prince was too busy to maintain his archive but that, by then, \u201cPrince is in such professional hands that the choreography is complete.\u201d</p> <p>The book contains cartoons by Prince (he called them \u201cPrince\u2019s Funnies\u201d), details of his first kiss, memories of watching R-rated movies at the local drive-in, and disses of the media conglomerates who control contemporary US music (\u201cWe need to tell them that they keep trying to ram Katy Perry and Ed Sheeran down our throats and we don\u2019t like it no matter how many times they play it\u201d). Of his mother, he recalls, \u201cShe would spend up what little $ the family had 4 survival on partying with her friends, then trespass in2 my bedroom, \u2018borrow\u2019 my personal $ that N\u2019d gotten from babysitting local kids, &amp; then chastise me 4 even questioning her regarding the broken promise she made 2 pay me back.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"83c93f5e82cb7bd646f2f7032b905355d0c3500f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/83c93f5e82cb7bd646f2f7032b905355d0c3500f/568_322_3544_3545/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Outtakes from the cover shoot for Parade, released in 1986.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Outtakes from the cover shoot for Parade, released in 1986.

      "bodyText": "When he was a teenager growing up in Phoenix, Maryland, Dan Piepenbring would often head to Walmart to check out the new release CDs. It was 1999 and the height of rap rock and nu metal, of Limp Bizkit and Korn, of hirsute man-boys with snapback hats and chain wallets. Piepenbring\u2019s curiosity was aroused by something else \u2013 a record called Rave Un2 The Joy Fantastic. \u201cThe singer was wearing a blue shiny outfit,\u201d he recalls. \u201cNot quite superhuman, but extraterrestrial. He had no name and looked so effeminate. He seemed to be of indeterminate ethnic origin. And I was a little afraid. He just seemed so weird. I remember handling the CD on successive visits to the store and thinking, \u2018What is this?\u2019 It was so gloriously out of sync with everything else on the shelves.\u201d That was Piepenbring\u2019s first encounter with Prince. In 2004, he listened to Purple Rain and was smitten. \u201cI became obsessed,\u201d he says over hamburger and fries in a Greenwich Village bar. Now 33, he has the underfed eloquence of the eternal postgrad. \u201cI had this sense that I was listening to someone who combined so many fascinating strains of popular music, from the last 50 years, in an original package.\u201d In 2016, Piepenbring was working as an editor at the New York-based literary journal Paris Review, when his agent told him Prince was searching for a co-writer to work on his memoir. He turned in a pitch-cum-love-letter: \u201cFrom my first encounter with Prince I knew he was a master storyteller,\u201d he wrote. \u201cTo help him tell his stories in a new mode would be a once-in-a-lifetime honour.\u201d Less than a day later, he was summoned to meet the singer at his Paisley Park complex in Minnesota. He got the assignment. What followed he describes as a \u201cbizarre, three-month detour in my life, a strange and voluptuous period. And so surreal.\u201d Piepenbring was a surprising choice, being all the things Prince was not: white, young, college-educated, outside the musical world, completely unknown. But Prince was famously secretive about his life, as well as dismissive of interviewers. He described writers as \u201cmamma-jammas wearing glasses and an alligator shirt behind a typewriter\u201d and claimed, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing a critic can tell me that I can learn from.\u201d Piepenbring remembers him saying that he regarded most of what had been written about him as \u201cgarbage\u201d. The Paris Review is best known for its extended interviews with authors, but this did not stop the young editor becoming Prince\u2019s amenuensis. \u201cMy first Monday coming back from Paisley Park, we gave over the weekly staff meeting to having me retell the story of that weekend. Then I was like: if any of this gets out I will never get this job!\u201d Over the next few weeks, Piepenbring and Prince went to concerts, parties and a private screening of Kung Fu Panda 3 together. They had conversations over the phone and in Prince\u2019s black Lincoln MKT (his driving, particularly his turn signalling, was excellent). The singer mentioned how at high school he\u2019d punched a kid who\u2019d thrown a racial slur at him \u2013 and that his best friend growing up was Jewish. He spoke about the death of an early love \u2013 the singer Vanity. \u201cHe had a great, deadpan and warm sense of humour. I was surprised by his autonomy and his ability to put people around him, including me, at ease.\u201d The writer flew to Australia where Prince, who was checking into hotels under the name Peter Bravestrong, discussed with him his ideas for the book. \u201cIs it about the music industry? His parents? A handbook for the black community? His ideas could change in the course of a single conversation. I don\u2019t know which one he would have settled on,\u201d he says. A degree of trust had been established \u2013 Prince referred to Piepenbring as \u201cmy brother Dan\u201d \u2013 and the singer talked of having the pair\u2019s distinct voices merge over the course of the narrative. Thinking back to the epilepsy he suffered as a child, Prince suggested, \u201cWe could use seizures as a way of blending our voices. Blackouts.\u201d I tell Piepenbring this sounds more like avant-garde fiction than a traditional rock memoir. \u201cWhich I was so looking forward to! The fact that he wanted to produce something so formalist and postmodern and strange was the most surprising thing. Especially because, at this point in his career, he was writing songs in various generic modes rather than, as he did in the 1980s, shattering those modes. But what a burden! There\u2019s no guarantee it would have been readable, or necessarily true to what he had imagined.\u201d On 21 April, barely three months after they had started collaborating, Prince\u2019s death was announced; he had overdosed on fentanyl. The last time the two men had spoken was four days earlier, when Prince had phoned, talked a lot about his parents\u2019 influence on his life, ending: \u201cI just wanted to call and let you know that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been thinking about. And I\u2019m OK.\u201d Was he lying? Was he, in fact, in great pain? \u201cMy thinking on this changes hour to hour. There were moments when I was certain he must have known, because to do those stripped-down Piano &amp; A Microphone shows, and to pair that with an autobiography seems so summative. It\u2019s rooted in a past that for the longest time he would have eschewed. Prince may have known he was in poor health, but there\u2019s a difference between that and knowing he was dying.\u201d His death seemed to spell the end for The Beautiful Ones (named after a song on the Purple Rain album), whose imminent publication had delighted fans. \u201cAfter he died, I was a mess,\u201d Piepenbring says. \u201cI was cranky, depressed. And I also felt a fool for feeling depressed: I didn\u2019t really even know this guy that well. But often I felt hurt and deprived and confused and angry at myself. And sometimes even at him.\u201d Prince died without making a will and in the months following his death his estate was run from the courts, with advisers coming and going, claims from various family members, constant threats of litigation. \u201cA book wasn\u2019t on the top of anyone\u2019s mind,\u201d says Piepenbring. \u201cThey needed to bring in a lot of income, and quickly. They were probably thinking: which album can we release?

There was no real method to the madness. In one room you\u2019d find something from 1979, and within arm\u2019s reach there\u2019d be something from 2002.

      "bodyText": "While conventional airlines struggle for more environmentally friendly alternatives to jet fuel, a host of startups are betting on zero-emission flight using electric power. They will not carry a hundred passengers across the Atlantic \u2013 but in the global race to develop an air taxi, two firms - one British and one German - have unveiled significant recent breakthroughs this month. The Bristol-based Vertical Aerospace flew its Seraph prototype around an airfield in Wales, carrying a load of 250kg. Meanwhile, in Munich its rival Lilium released footage of its futuristic electric jet making the key transition from a vertical takeoff to forward flight. These technical milestones have been accompanied by announcements of further investment: a factory for Lilium that will be capable of building 100 aircraft a year, while Vertical Aerospace have snapped up a Formula One consultancy to bring in extra engineering expertise to hone the final model. Both companies claim a potential transformation of domestic transport could be only three to five years away. Dozens of firms are jostling for a slice of the market in this emerging sector \u2013 electric-powered vertical takeoff and landing (eVtol) aircraft \u2013 which analysts at UBS predict will be worth \u00a3150bn by 2040. Most are happy to use the shorthand of \u201cflying taxi\u201d, although Lilium and Vertical Aerospace say the aircraft\u2019s useful range is further than just short hops around a city, such as those on test at Volocopter and Uber Elevate. Earlier this week, Volocopter sent its electric helicopter lookalike for a test flight around Singapore\u2019s Marina Bay. It has a range of about 22 miles and can reach almost 70mph.

The jet, he says, could operate for longer and go at least six times faster than a taxi, while fuel costs would be negligible. Both deflect sceptical questions by comparing the delay and expense in conventional transport infrastructure, not least HS2. Fitzpatrick believes his aircraft could operate by 2022, long before any new high-speed rail tracks: \u201cYou could be between Manchester and Leeds in 20 minutes \u2013 from rooftop to rooftop - think how that would transform the northern powerhouse.\u201d Many transport experts, however, aren\u2019t convinced.

In a matter of months, I\u2019d be going to stay with her Stuttgart-based family for a week, and shortly after that, she\u2019d come and stay on the Welsh border, with me. I was 13. The whole thing was thrilling.</p> <p>Her house was warm, spotless and deliciously different. I remember ornamental candles, and rugs on a tiled floor, the furniture sleek and well-designed, and a shining upright piano in the corner, which Hanna, of course, played very well. On arrival, Hanna\u2019s mother asked me what I wanted for breakfast, and when I didn\u2019t immediately answer, she began listing all the foodstuffs she had available. Around about item six or seven, I recognised the German for cake, so I said, \u201cCake, please.\u201d</p> <p>Hanna\u2019s mother was a magnificent cook. I particularly remember the clear soup with dumplings and the sausage with lentils, and every morning of my visit, presumably because she thought that\u2019s what I was used to, she gave me cake for breakfast. It was glorious.</p> <p>I kept in touch with Hanna for years, and when I was 15, the family invited me, with incredible generosity, to accompany them on a month-long trip to Italy. So, it was with Hanna and her family that I first saw the Mediterranean and first tasted shellfish.</p> <p>I came home from Italy thirsty for more European adventures. I got myself a French pen pal called Adele, with whom in due course I went to stay in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/brittany\" title=\"\">Brittany</a>. There I watched her mother make cr\u00eapes, the region\u2019s speciality, on the <em>bilig</em>, a large, circular griddle: they were the most delicious things I\u2019d ever eaten, even including the Italian lobster. When out of sight of adults, I took advantage of the cheapness of French cigarettes and practised my nascent smoking habit, trying really hard to like Gitanes, and almost succeeding.</p> <p>When I turned 16, my best friend and I cooked up the idea of going backpacking in Austria for a couple of weeks. Looking back, I do slightly wonder what our parents were thinking, letting us go: two schoolgirls with a smattering of German heading off on a coach with no fixed plans and no accommodation booked. We emerged from the experience unscathed: we successfully read the foreign train timetables, always managed to find accommodation, swam in ice-cold mountain lakes under brilliant sunlight and travelled from town to town as the fancy took us.</p> <p>As I grew older, my determination to cross the Channel, even if alone or with insufficient funds, grew. If you had an Interrail ticket, surely one of the best inventions of all time, you could simply catch another train if you couldn\u2019t find a room, or else doze in the station until the next one arrived. I took off alone at 19 to wander around France, a jaunt that ended abruptly with the theft of my wallet.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Many children, including my own eldest daughter, wouldn\u2019t have been born without the frictionless travel the EU gave us</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>However, I was soon back again, because I spent a year in Paris as part of my French degree. My mother, a quiet Francophile with a half-French father, was delighted to visit me there; my father, possibly less so, given my perennially unsuccessful pleas to waiters to understand that <em>bien cuit</em> in his case meant there must be no pink at all in the middle of the steak.</p> <p>I was 25 when my mother died, at which point I stopped pretending I wanted any kind of office job. Now I did what came most naturally: grabbed the dog-eared manuscript of the children\u2019s book I\u2019d been writing for a few months and took off across the Channel again. Disorientated with grief, I\u2019d chosen one of the three teaching jobs offered to me almost at random. It was in Portugal, a country I didn\u2019t know, and where I couldn\u2019t speak a word of the language.</p> <p>Teaching English abroad is a perfectly respectable profession, but nobody who has done it can deny that it attracts its fair share of misfits and runaways. I was both. Nevertheless, I fell in love with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/jan/29/porto-portugal-city-guide-local-guide-cafe-restaurant-hotel\" title=\"\">Porto</a> and I love it still. I was enchanted by fado, the melancholy folk music that reflects the Portuguese themselves, who in my experience had a quietness and gentleness unique among Latin peoples I\u2019d encountered so far. The city\u2019s spectacular bridges, its vertiginous riverbanks, steep with ancient buildings, the old port houses, the wide squares: I was entranced by them all.</p> <p>We all have shining memories of our youth, made poignant because they\u2019re freighted with knowledge of what happened later to companions, and what lay ahead for ourselves. Back then we were allowed to roam freely across Europe in a way that shaped and enriched us, while benefiting from the longest uninterrupted spell of peace this continent has ever known. Lifelong friendships, love affairs and marriages could never have happened. Several children of my acquaintance, including my own eldest daughter, wouldn\u2019t have been born without the frictionless travel the EU gave us.</p> <p>At the time of writing, it\u2019s uncertain whether the next generation will enjoy the freedoms we had. Those of us who know exactly how deep a loss that is, are experiencing a vicarious sense of bereavement, on top of our own dismay at the threatened rupture of old ties.</p> <p>I think again of my teenage pen friend Hanna, as I reach for a quotation by Voltaire. She rarely let me get away with anything, so she\u2019d probably have accused me of choosing a French philosopher in a spirit of pure provocation.</p> <p>Well, Hanna was right about many things, but on this she\u2019d be wrong. The truth is that I\u2019m thinking of her now because she was my first friend from continental Europe, and because the words of Voltaire that hold so much meaning for me now are these: \u201c<em>L\u2019amiti\u00e9 est la patrie.</em>\u201d \u201cWhere there is friendship, there is our homeland.\u201d And Hanna, I really don\u2019t want to lose my homeland.</p> <h2><strong>In the passport queue</strong></h2> <p><em>Jeffrey Boakye</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"67f181c491cd3b242372fd70d4713e579749c357\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/67f181c491cd3b242372fd70d4713e579749c357/0_0_280_280/280.png\" alt=\"Jeffrey Boakye Circular panelist byline DO NOT USE FOR ANY OTHER PURPOSE!\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s always at the airport. In that queue waiting to show your passport and be given entry into the country in question, with a sprint of thoughts rushing through the mind, competing fears about how and if you are going to be accepted. In that final step you always feel so other, so different, clinging to your British identity, leather-bound in red, hoping it will keep you buoyant in unfamiliar seas. That\u2019s the point when you feel most far from home; the wrong colour, in the wrong country, with the wrong language and feeling the wrong cocktail of apprehensions.</p> <p>But then, you get to the Perspex booth, and something happens. There\u2019s a smile, or a chat, or a comment \u2013 some kind of exchange that reminds you that you belong, at least, to this moment. That it\u2019s not always aggression or suspicion. That sometimes, it\u2019s a welcome. You collect those moments, because they are valuable.

I worked as a short order cook at a coffee shop in Golders Green. Colette was our manager and she hailed from Ireland. French Sarah and Marie waited tables and there were many others whose names have sadly faded. I was born in London of Indian parents, but we were all young Londoners full of curiosity for our city and the wide world beyond. We spent much of our spare time together, in bedsits and shared houses.</p> <p>Then one day, Sarah became bored or homesick or both. She was taking off for her mother\u2019s house in the south of France and I was invited. I had already been to Paris several times, had a French A-level and a little reading of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/albertcamus\" title=\"\">Camus</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/22/jean-paul-sartre-refuses-nobel-prize-literature-50-years-books\" title=\"\">Sartre</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/aug/20/was-simone-de-beauvoir-as-feminist-as-we-thought\" title=\"\">De Beauvoir</a>. Yet there is nothing quite like the opportunity to stay with a family, sharing their food, shelter and stories. That kindness \u2013 repeated many times in the years that followed \u2013 helped shape me. </p> <p>Some months later Anya, a German friend and fellow law student, invited a few of us, first to her home in Frankfurt and then to Berlin to celebrate New Year\u2019s Eve. What a night. During the day there were all sorts of restrictions on how to cross the divide via the Brandenburg Gate or Checkpoint Charlie, depending on your nationality. As midnight approached, the sheer numbers of revellers made policing redundant. I found myself hauled up by human hydraulics and then, moments later, I was in the East. I went home to London with beautiful graffitied fragments from the once so brutally permanent wall that was not to last the year. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9b675aaa1496480ff751d3176852d3088b292a9d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b675aaa1496480ff751d3176852d3088b292a9d/0_122_4252_2552/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Liverpool v Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach in the 1973 Uefa Cup final.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Liverpool v Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach in the 1973 Uefa Cup final.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ullstein Bild/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>You\u2019ll never walk alone</strong></h2> <p><em>Frank Cottrell Boyce</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"c930b9a883e24b85572a60bd7ca98eaffd922ecc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c930b9a883e24b85572a60bd7ca98eaffd922ecc/0_0_280_280/280.png\" alt=\"Frank Cottrell Boyce.

After the match, the Prussian police herded thousands of ecstatic scousers on to the waiting charter planes. It was only when he came down to earth with a bump at Liverpool airport that Billy remembered he\u2019d gone to the match in his van. The van that was \u2013 he hoped \u2013 still neatly parked in the shade of the maples in the Bunter Garten a thousand miles away.</p> <p>That night was the start of our love affair with Europe. Until then, Liverpool\u2019s gaze was fixed the other way \u2013 over the sea to Ireland, New York, Valpara\u00edso \u2013 the old sea routes our fathers had travelled, returning with the monkeys and parrots that played around our tenement balconies long after those trades had stopped.</p> <p>It was football that bounced Europe into our lives. Liverpool often felt disconnected from the rest of England, but football connected us to Europe like a perfectly weighted pass. Young men who might barely have travelled beyond their own neighbourhoods became familiar with the bus and metro routes of Paris, Rome, Amsterdam and of course M\u00f6nchengladbach. I remember sitting in the Liverpool Irish Centre one evening when a whole crowd of slightly merry Dutch fans in orange burst in, saying, \u201cIrish!? We\u2019re with you. Orange and Green, yes?\u201d As though in Ireland the orange and green were just two colours that went together well, rather than the blazons of an ancient blood feud. Everyone cheered them and bought them pints. I ended up driving four of them to Anfield.</p> <p>I have lived in France and Spain. I\u2019ve worked in Italy. But I always end up back here in my hometown. I\u2019m rooted, as Yeats said, in \u201cone dear perpetual place\u201d. But I hold in my heart a truth that our current leaders are constantly trying to erase \u2013 the truth that you can dedicate yourself to one place while revelling in the fact that it is part of something greater, that we never walk alone.</p> <p>Love and kisses from Liverpool.</p> <h2><strong>A larger life</strong></h2> <p><em>Alan Hollinghurst</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"bc6b262bbae2bb83e21a66be0d48f62b85db3034\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bc6b262bbae2bb83e21a66be0d48f62b85db3034/0_0_280_280/280.png\" alt=\"Alan Hollinghurst.

What will never be forgotten is the sense of impatience for the other side, for Calais, Amiens, Paris. To learn how to get from the Gare du Nord to the Gare de Lyon, to find a room and order a beer and a croque monsieur, was to take command of a larger life, something we\u2019d been raised and readied for and where we felt at once we belonged.</p> <p>Mile after mile, night after day, the journey went on: Marseille, Ventimiglia, Turin, Milan, possibilities turning to practical certainties, even Venice itself. This was something much larger and deeper than a holiday. We knew we belonged in Europe as our own country belonged there; all my adult life has been spent as a citizen of Europe as well as of Britain, each thing felt keenly to be both a privilege and a right. The mood, the madness, of our time is to destroy concord, cooperation, and as an inevitable result to destroy ourselves. If it\u2019s already too late to halt the destruction, it is also too late to efface the knowledge that we share in our millions, that we are Europeans.</p> <h2><strong>A new </strong><strong>European song</strong></h2> <p><em>Mary Beard</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"ddb3797789e9dd42f1e7f28e95469f5f3c8da6b9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ddb3797789e9dd42f1e7f28e95469f5f3c8da6b9/0_0_280_280/280.png\" alt=\"Mary Beard Circular panelist byline DO NOT USE FOR ANY OTHER PURPOSE!\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>My career as an academic can be measured against the history of the Common Market, the EEC and the EU. I left school in 1972, and over those last forty-something years, what I do, the context in which I do it, and how I define myself and my job has changed dramatically, taking a decidedly European turn that is, without doubt, a turn for the better.</p> <p>I now expect to find students from all over Europe in my classes. Some of my closest colleagues in my department in Cambridge come from Italy, Germany and Greece. It\u2019s two-way traffic as our staff and students have come simply to assume that \u201cthe Continent\u201d \u2013 as we used to call it, as if it wasn\u2019t us \u2013 is as open to them as the UK is. It\u2019s open for conversation, for resources and for collaboration. This doesn\u2019t just add to the local colour; the mix of cultures and languages, of educational backgrounds and different traditions of expertise has widened all our horizons.</p> <p>And it has changed how we think about our subject, our opportunities, and even about the very nature of education itself. To put it another way, whereas back in the 1980s I would have introduced myself as a British academic, maybe even an English one, I now also think of myself and call myself European, and I mean also. You don\u2019t give up feeling British when you start to feel European.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We didn\u2019t work hard enough over the decades to share the benefits of Europe of which we were so rightly proud</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But there\u2019s another less optimistic side to this, and that comes down to the question of who exactly the beneficiaries of what I\u2019m calling this New European culture have been. It\u2019s all very well for intellectuals to enjoy the new linguistic Babel of their common rooms, or of the students at elite universities to take advantage of the new horizons that come with cultural European collaboration. But none of that means very much to the unemployed of, say, Boston, Lincolnshire.</p> <p>Those of us who have been the beneficiaries of New Europe must face the uncomfortable fact that we are partly to blame for the vote going, in our terms, so badly wrong. Because we didn\u2019t stop, or we didn\u2019t stop long enough, to think of those who are on the other side of the cultural divide. We didn\u2019t work hard enough over the decades, not just over the months of the referendum campaign, to share the benefits of which we were so certain and so rightly proud.</p> <h2><strong>Not someone like you</strong></h2> <p><em>Michel Faber</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"4da6123984162b8c2ae2b88c402f6b5c10c87bc2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4da6123984162b8c2ae2b88c402f6b5c10c87bc2/0_0_280_280/280.png\" alt=\"Michel Faber Circular panelist byline DO NOT USE FOR ANY OTHER PURPOSE!\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>\u201cOh, it won\u2019t come to that, surely?\u201d This is a phrase I\u2019ve heard many times in the last three years.

Since that day, they\u2019ve reassured themselves that the fracture in our society can be reversed, as if a pane of glass can be talked out of the crack in it, as if a burst balloon can be made to see that staying intact is the best thing all round.</p> <p>I tell them that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\" title=\"\">Brexit</a> reclassifies me an illegal alien, officially \u201cUnsettled\u201d, unless I apply to Britain\u2019s xenophobic government for permission to stay. \u201cBut you\u2019re British, surely?\u201d No, I am not British. \u201cBut you\u2019ve lived here for so long.\u201d Yes, but that\u2019s not the point.

The obvious place is the Netherlands, where I was born. But I remember almost nothing from the first seven years of my life. They were spent in Den Haag, apparently, but Den Haag to me is just a railway station.</p> <p>Two decades ago, when the Dutch translation of <em>Under the Skin</em> was about to be published and I travelled to Holland to help promote it, a local journalist drove me to the neighbourhood where I spent my early years. He was intrigued by what I\u2019d said in interviews about childhood trauma, the factors that led my parents to cut themselves off from their other children and emigrate with me to Australia, the frighteningly blank spaces in my memory where most people have formative stories. He was convinced that if he took me to the place where I\u2019d lived, parked me in the street where I\u2019d played, something would come back to me. We sat in the car for a while, with the tape recorder running. I thanked him for his kindness. Then we returned to the hotel, and I packed my bag for the airport.</p> <p>A love letter to Europe?

Although Germany and Denmark share a border, at first the conflict stayed south. Then, on 9 April 1940 the Germans moved north and invaded Denmark. Life for the Danes changed for ever. </p> <p>In the first year or so of occupation what the Germans called the \u201cJewish problem\u201d was not raised with the Danes. Denmark did not have a large Jewish population. There were just under 8,000 members of the community living across the country. As far as I am aware my grandparents didn\u2019t know any Jews personally but, in the autumn of 1943, word was leaked that the Jews of Denmark were to be deported to concentration camps. On 29 September the Danish Jews were warned by the chief rabbi of Denmark to go into hiding immediately.</p> <p>Farfar (Danish for Father\u2019s father) built a false wall in the apartment and painted it to look like the end of their sitting room. Behind this theatrical piece of set he and Farmor (Father\u2019s mother) concealed Jewish families on the run. My father, still a little boy, went door to door, removing Jewish names from doorbells and replacing them with ordinary Danish ones. One day my grandparents got word that the German authorities were coming to raid the apartment. Farmor took a knife and cut her legs, applying theatrical makeup to the wounds. When the men arrived, she was lying on a sofa. The terrible running sores on her legs persuaded the invaders they did not want to stay. The apartment was not searched, and the hidden family not found.</p> <p>Sweden was neutral in the war and, on 2 October that year, the Swedish government announced its willingness to take all Danish Jews. This land of freedom lay just 10 miles or so across open water. Fishermen up and down the coast gathered with any boat they could find. Across the \u00d8resund the exodus of the Jews began. Not every Dane behaved well and not every German behaved badly. Life is not that clear-cut. But in the end over 99% of Danish Jews escaped the Holocaust. It was the finest example of cooperation in the face of injustice. My family had no reason to risk their lives for strangers, but when I asked my father why they had done it he simply shrugged and said: \u201cIt was the right thing to do.\u201d</p> <p>I think of this when I walk on that beach and look out to the stretch of sea that was once the site of that astonishing rescue. I hope I would have the same courage to do the right thing. I tell the story because history matters. Since the end of the second world war and the wonderful decision by European countries to work together, we have had peace. Almost 75 years of it. I love peace and quiet.

      "bodyText": "Writing home JK Rowling The letter was written on thin, pale blue paper. The handwriting was neat and rounded. My brand-new German pen friend, Hanna, introduced herself in excellent English. Our schools had decided that Hanna and I would be a good fit as pen pals because we were both, not to put too fine a point on it, swots. In a matter of months, I\u2019d be going to stay with her Stuttgart-based family for a week, and shortly after that, she\u2019d come and stay on the Welsh border, with me. I was 13. The whole thing was thrilling. Her house was warm, spotless and deliciously different. I remember ornamental candles, and rugs on a tiled floor, the furniture sleek and well-designed, and a shining upright piano in the corner, which Hanna, of course, played very well. On arrival, Hanna\u2019s mother asked me what I wanted for breakfast, and when I didn\u2019t immediately answer, she began listing all the foodstuffs she had available. Around about item six or seven, I recognised the German for cake, so I said, \u201cCake, please.\u201d Hanna\u2019s mother was a magnificent cook. I particularly remember the clear soup with dumplings and the sausage with lentils, and every morning of my visit, presumably because she thought that\u2019s what I was used to, she gave me cake for breakfast. It was glorious. I kept in touch with Hanna for years, and when I was 15, the family invited me, with incredible generosity, to accompany them on a month-long trip to Italy. So, it was with Hanna and her family that I first saw the Mediterranean and first tasted shellfish. I came home from Italy thirsty for more European adventures. I got myself a French pen pal called Adele, with whom in due course I went to stay in Brittany. There I watched her mother make cr\u00eapes, the region\u2019s speciality, on the bilig, a large, circular griddle: they were the most delicious things I\u2019d ever eaten, even including the Italian lobster. When out of sight of adults, I took advantage of the cheapness of French cigarettes and practised my nascent smoking habit, trying really hard to like Gitanes, and almost succeeding. When I turned 16, my best friend and I cooked up the idea of going backpacking in Austria for a couple of weeks. Looking back, I do slightly wonder what our parents were thinking, letting us go: two schoolgirls with a smattering of German heading off on a coach with no fixed plans and no accommodation booked. We emerged from the experience unscathed: we successfully read the foreign train timetables, always managed to find accommodation, swam in ice-cold mountain lakes under brilliant sunlight and travelled from town to town as the fancy took us. As I grew older, my determination to cross the Channel, even if alone or with insufficient funds, grew. If you had an Interrail ticket, surely one of the best inventions of all time, you could simply catch another train if you couldn\u2019t find a room, or else doze in the station until the next one arrived. I took off alone at 19 to wander around France, a jaunt that ended abruptly with the theft of my wallet. However, I was soon back again, because I spent a year in Paris as part of my French degree. My mother, a quiet Francophile with a half-French father, was delighted to visit me there; my father, possibly less so, given my perennially unsuccessful pleas to waiters to understand that bien cuit in his case meant there must be no pink at all in the middle of the steak. I was 25 when my mother died, at which point I stopped pretending I wanted any kind of office job. Now I did what came most naturally: grabbed the dog-eared manuscript of the children\u2019s book I\u2019d been writing for a few months and took off across the Channel again. Disorientated with grief, I\u2019d chosen one of the three teaching jobs offered to me almost at random. It was in Portugal, a country I didn\u2019t know, and where I couldn\u2019t speak a word of the language. Teaching English abroad is a perfectly respectable profession, but nobody who has done it can deny that it attracts its fair share of misfits and runaways. I was both. Nevertheless, I fell in love with Porto and I love it still. I was enchanted by fado, the melancholy folk music that reflects the Portuguese themselves, who in my experience had a quietness and gentleness unique among Latin peoples I\u2019d encountered so far. The city\u2019s spectacular bridges, its vertiginous riverbanks, steep with ancient buildings, the old port houses, the wide squares: I was entranced by them all. We all have shining memories of our youth, made poignant because they\u2019re freighted with knowledge of what happened later to companions, and what lay ahead for ourselves. Back then we were allowed to roam freely across Europe in a way that shaped and enriched us, while benefiting from the longest uninterrupted spell of peace this continent has ever known. Lifelong friendships, love affairs and marriages could never have happened. Several children of my acquaintance, including my own eldest daughter, wouldn\u2019t have been born without the frictionless travel the EU gave us. At the time of writing, it\u2019s uncertain whether the next generation will enjoy the freedoms we had. Those of us who know exactly how deep a loss that is, are experiencing a vicarious sense of bereavement, on top of our own dismay at the threatened rupture of old ties. I think again of my teenage pen friend Hanna, as I reach for a quotation by Voltaire. She rarely let me get away with anything, so she\u2019d probably have accused me of choosing a French philosopher in a spirit of pure provocation. Well, Hanna was right about many things, but on this she\u2019d be wrong. The truth is that I\u2019m thinking of her now because she was my first friend from continental Europe, and because the words of Voltaire that hold so much meaning for me now are these: \u201cL\u2019amiti\u00e9 est la patrie.\u201d \u201cWhere there is friendship, there is our homeland.\u201d And Hanna, I really don\u2019t want to lose my homeland. In the passport queue Jeffrey Boakye It\u2019s always at the airport. In that queue waiting to show your passport and be given entry into the country in question, with a sprint of thoughts rushing through the mind, competing fears about how and if you are going to be accepted. In that final step you always feel so other, so different, clinging to your British identity, leather-bound in red, hoping it will keep you buoyant in unfamiliar seas. That\u2019s the point when you feel most far from home; the wrong colour, in the wrong country, with the wrong language and feeling the wrong cocktail of apprehensions. But then, you get to the Perspex booth, and something happens. There\u2019s a smile, or a chat, or a comment \u2013 some kind of exchange that reminds you that you belong, at least, to this moment. That it\u2019s not always aggression or suspicion. That sometimes, it\u2019s a welcome. You collect those moments, because they are valuable. You hope that they won\u2019t become rare. Near Year\u2019s Eve, Berlin Shami Chakrabarti It was the late 1980s and my long vacation from law studies at the LSE. I worked as a short order cook at a coffee shop in Golders Green. Colette was our manager and she hailed from Ireland. French Sarah and Marie waited tables and there were many others whose names have sadly faded. I was born in London of Indian parents, but we were all young Londoners full of curiosity for our city and the wide world beyond. We spent much of our spare time together, in bedsits and shared houses. Then one day, Sarah became bored or homesick or both. She was taking off for her mother\u2019s house in the south of France and I was invited. I had already been to Paris several times, had a French A-level and a little reading of Camus, Sartre and De Beauvoir. Yet there is nothing quite like the opportunity to stay with a family, sharing their food, shelter and stories. That kindness \u2013 repeated many times in the years that followed \u2013 helped shape me. Some months later Anya, a German friend and fellow law student, invited a few of us, first to her home in Frankfurt and then to Berlin to celebrate New Year\u2019s Eve. What a night. During the day there were all sorts of restrictions on how to cross the divide via the Brandenburg Gate or Checkpoint Charlie, depending on your nationality. As midnight approached, the sheer numbers of revellers made policing redundant. I found myself hauled up by human hydraulics and then, moments later, I was in the East. I went home to London with beautiful graffitied fragments from the once so brutally permanent wall that was not to last the year. You\u2019ll never walk alone Frank Cottrell Boyce Dear Europe, Remember that time in 1973 when Uncle Billy went to watch the Reds beat Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach 3\u20132 (on aggregate) in the final of the Uefa Cup? After the match, the Prussian police herded thousands of ecstatic scousers on to the waiting charter planes. It was only when he came down to earth with a bump at Liverpool airport that Billy remembered he\u2019d gone to the match in his van. The van that was \u2013 he hoped \u2013 still neatly parked in the shade of the maples in the Bunter Garten a thousand miles away. That night was the start of our love affair with Europe. Until then, Liverpool\u2019s gaze was fixed the other way \u2013 over the sea to Ireland, New York, Valpara\u00edso \u2013 the old sea routes our fathers had travelled, returning with the monkeys and parrots that played around our tenement balconies long after those trades had stopped. It was football that bounced Europe into our lives. Liverpool often felt disconnected from the rest of England, but football connected us to Europe like a perfectly weighted pass. Young men who might barely have travelled beyond their own neighbourhoods became familiar with the bus and metro routes of Paris, Rome, Amsterdam and of course M\u00f6nchengladbach. I remember sitting in the Liverpool Irish Centre one evening when a whole crowd of slightly merry Dutch fans in orange burst in, saying, \u201cIrish!? We\u2019re with you. Orange and Green, yes?\u201d As though in Ireland the orange and green were just two colours that went together well, rather than the blazons of an ancient blood feud. Everyone cheered them and bought them pints. I ended up driving four of them to Anfield. I have lived in France and Spain. I\u2019ve worked in Italy. But I always end up back here in my hometown. I\u2019m rooted, as Yeats said, in \u201cone dear perpetual place\u201d. But I hold in my heart a truth that our current leaders are constantly trying to erase \u2013 the truth that you can dedicate yourself to one place while revelling in the fact that it is part of something greater, that we never walk alone. Love and kisses from Liverpool. A larger life Alan Hollinghurst It\u2019s hard now to remember the boat-train and even the ferry itself, beyond the unstoppable moment when it cast off, the catch of the breath as the quay stepped sideways and everything realigned. What will never be forgotten is the sense of impatience for the other side, for Calais, Amiens, Paris. To learn how to get from the Gare du Nord to the Gare de Lyon, to find a room and order a beer and a croque monsieur, was to take command of a larger life, something we\u2019d been raised and readied for and where we felt at once we belonged. Mile after mile, night after day, the journey went on: Marseille, Ventimiglia, Turin, Milan, possibilities turning to practical certainties, even Venice itself. This was something much larger and deeper than a holiday. We knew we belonged in Europe as our own country belonged there; all my adult life has been spent as a citizen of Europe as well as of Britain, each thing felt keenly to be both a privilege and a right. The mood, the madness, of our time is to destroy concord, cooperation, and as an inevitable result to destroy ourselves. If it\u2019s already too late to halt the destruction, it is also too late to efface the knowledge that we share in our millions, that we are Europeans. A new European song Mary Beard My career as an academic can be measured against the history of the Common Market, the EEC and the EU. I left school in 1972, and over those last forty-something years, what I do, the context in which I do it, and how I define myself and my job has changed dramatically, taking a decidedly European turn that is, without doubt, a turn for the better. I now expect to find students from all over Europe in my classes. Some of my closest colleagues in my department in Cambridge come from Italy, Germany and Greece. It\u2019s two-way traffic as our staff and students have come simply to assume that \u201cthe Continent\u201d \u2013 as we used to call it, as if it wasn\u2019t us \u2013 is as open to them as the UK is. It\u2019s open for conversation, for resources and for collaboration. This doesn\u2019t just add to the local colour; the mix of cultures and languages, of educational backgrounds and different traditions of expertise has widened all our horizons. And it has changed how we think about our subject, our opportunities, and even about the very nature of education itself. To put it another way, whereas back in the 1980s I would have introduced myself as a British academic, maybe even an English one, I now also think of myself and call myself European, and I mean also. You don\u2019t give up feeling British when you start to feel European. But there\u2019s another less optimistic side to this, and that comes down to the question of who exactly the beneficiaries of what I\u2019m calling this New European culture have been. It\u2019s all very well for intellectuals to enjoy the new linguistic Babel of their common rooms, or of the students at elite universities to take advantage of the new horizons that come with cultural European collaboration. But none of that means very much to the unemployed of, say, Boston, Lincolnshire. Those of us who have been the beneficiaries of New Europe must face the uncomfortable fact that we are partly to blame for the vote going, in our terms, so badly wrong. Because we didn\u2019t stop, or we didn\u2019t stop long enough, to think of those who are on the other side of the cultural divide. We didn\u2019t work hard enough over the decades, not just over the months of the referendum campaign, to share the benefits of which we were so certain and so rightly proud. Not someone like you Michel Faber \u201cOh, it won\u2019t come to that, surely?\u201d This is a phrase I\u2019ve heard many times in the last three years. It\u2019s uttered by friendly, cultured, open-minded people in my town \u2013 the sort of people who woke up on the morning of 24 June 2016 blinking in disbelief at finding their values outvoted. Since that day, they\u2019ve reassured themselves that the fracture in our society can be reversed, as if a pane of glass can be talked out of the crack in it, as if a burst balloon can be made to see that staying intact is the best thing all round. I tell them that Brexit reclassifies me an illegal alien, officially \u201cUnsettled\u201d, unless I apply to Britain\u2019s xenophobic government for permission to stay. \u201cBut you\u2019re British, surely?\u201d No, I am not British. \u201cBut you\u2019ve lived here for so long.\u201d Yes, but that\u2019s not the point. This whole business is about rejecting multiculturalism, sorting out who\u2019s Us and who\u2019s Them. I am not Us. \u201cWell, can\u2019t you just apply?\u201d Of course I can apply. But I don\u2019t want to. It\u2019s wrong. It stinks. \u201cYou\u2019ve got nothing to worry about, surely? I mean, come on, they\u2019re not going to send police to your flat to deport you. Not someone like you.\u201d I don\u2019t know what to say to these soft-hearted British Europhiles with their quaint notions of where the march of history will be too principled to go, their feeling that a Dutchman who speaks English ever so well and wrote The Crimson Petal and the White would surely be exempted from government regulations. I wonder where I\u2019ll go, if I have to leave. The obvious place is the Netherlands, where I was born. But I remember almost nothing from the first seven years of my life. They were spent in Den Haag, apparently, but Den Haag to me is just a railway station. Two decades ago, when the Dutch translation of Under the Skin was about to be published and I travelled to Holland to help promote it, a local journalist drove me to the neighbourhood where I spent my early years. He was intrigued by what I\u2019d said in interviews about childhood trauma, the factors that led my parents to cut themselves off from their other children and emigrate with me to Australia, the frighteningly blank spaces in my memory where most people have formative stories. He was convinced that if he took me to the place where I\u2019d lived, parked me in the street where I\u2019d played, something would come back to me. We sat in the car for a while, with the tape recorder running. I thanked him for his kindness. Then we returned to the hotel, and I packed my bag for the airport. A love letter to Europe? I already wrote it, 26 years ago, to Britain, and I thought the answer was yes. On peace and quiet Sandi Toksvig In 1939, when the second world war broke out, my grandparents were living in Copenhagen, writing and acting. Although Germany and Denmark share a border, at first the conflict stayed south. Then, on 9 April 1940 the Germans moved north and invaded Denmark. Life for the Danes changed for ever. In the first year or so of occupation what the Germans called the \u201cJewish problem\u201d was not raised with the Danes. Denmark did not have a large Jewish population. There were just under 8,000 members of the community living across the country. As far as I am aware my grandparents didn\u2019t know any Jews personally but, in the autumn of 1943, word was leaked that the Jews of Denmark were to be deported to concentration camps. On 29 September the Danish Jews were warned by the chief rabbi of Denmark to go into hiding immediately. Farfar (Danish for Father\u2019s father) built a false wall in the apartment and painted it to look like the end of their sitting room. Behind this theatrical piece of set he and Farmor (Father\u2019s mother) concealed Jewish families on the run. My father, still a little boy, went door to door, removing Jewish names from doorbells and replacing them with ordinary Danish ones. One day my grandparents got word that the German authorities were coming to raid the apartment. Farmor took a knife and cut her legs, applying theatrical makeup to the wounds. When the men arrived, she was lying on a sofa. The terrible running sores on her legs persuaded the invaders they did not want to stay. The apartment was not searched, and the hidden family not found. Sweden was neutral in the war and, on 2 October that year, the Swedish government announced its willingness to take all Danish Jews. This land of freedom lay just 10 miles or so across open water. Fishermen up and down the coast gathered with any boat they could find. Across the \u00d8resund the exodus of the Jews began. Not every Dane behaved well and not every German behaved badly. Life is not that clear-cut. But in the end over 99% of Danish Jews escaped the Holocaust. It was the finest example of cooperation in the face of injustice. My family had no reason to risk their lives for strangers, but when I asked my father why they had done it he simply shrugged and said: \u201cIt was the right thing to do.\u201d I think of this when I walk on that beach and look out to the stretch of sea that was once the site of that astonishing rescue. I hope I would have the same courage to do the right thing. I tell the story because history matters. Since the end of the second world war and the wonderful decision by European countries to work together, we have had peace. Almost 75 years of it. I love peace and quiet. I love Europe. Odyssey Tony Robinson The first book I ever remember reading was about Odysseus and his agonisingly long journey home. Then I encountered Theseus and the Minotaur, Jason and his fleece, and the other musclebound ancient Greek heroes and sometimes vengeful, always long-suffering heroines. In my teens, to the accompaniment of the Beatles\u2019 \u201cI Wanna Hold Your Hand\u201d and wearing a Ban the Bomb badge, I absorbed myself in Camus, Sartre, De Beauvoir and Malraux. They dripped with meaning, although I wasn\u2019t quite sure what the meaning was. At 19 I played the middle-aged dupe Orgon in Moli\u00e8re\u2019s excoriating play Tartuffe, my hair plastered with white liquid makeup, and sporting a limp and a stick to indicate my character\u2019s advanced years. I worked alongside Donald Sinden in Ibsen\u2019s majestic Enemy of the People, a play that should be required reading in these dark days. In my kaftan, and through heavily smudged John Lennon glasses, I read Hermann Hesse, G\u00fcnter Grass and Thomas Mann. Then Cervantes, Goethe and Dante until in my 50s I finally realised I\u2019d been imbibing far too much testosterone and turned my attention to writers such as Colette and George Sand. I am currently feasting on Elena Ferrante\u2019s glorious Neapolitan novel sequence. On this odyssey I\u2019ve never once thought of any of the above authors as exotic, foreign or outside my sphere of understanding. They are as much part of me as Shakespeare, the Bront\u00ebs and the Beatles. They shaped me, moulded me, wrought me. I am British and I am European. Neither diminishes the other. Both enhance the other. A love letter to Europe Neil Gaiman Dear Europe, I loved feeling part of you.

In fact, the dictators repeatedly made terrible mistakes and appear to have had few if any lasting achievements.

When Dik\u00f6tter writes that the dry-as-dust <em>Short Course on the History of the All-Union Communist Party</em>, in whose composition Stalin participated, \u201cdeified Stalin as the living fount of wisdom\u201d, I wonder if he has actually read it.</p> <p>For me, the most entertaining chapters of this book were about the dictators I was least familiar with. It is intriguing to read that the remains of Mengistu\u2019s predecessor, Emperor Haile Selassie, were possibly \u201cburied underneath his office, placing his desk right above the corpse\u201d. The stand-out dictator, in terms of entertainment value, is Duvalier, with his personal militia the Tonton Macoutes, who \u201cdressed like gangsters, with shiny blue-serge suits, dark, steel-rimmed glasses and grey homburg hats\u201d for their enforcement duties. Duvalier modelled himself on Baron Samedi, the Vodou spirit of the dead and guardian of cemeteries, and sometimes dressed the part, all in black, with top hat and carrying a cane. Dik\u00f6tter characterises him as a \u201cdictator\u2019s dictator\u201d, by which I think he means the stripped-down model with \u201cno true party\u201d and without the \u201cpretence of ideology\u201d. Certainly Duvalier has a claim to be the <em>reductio ad absurdum</em>.</p> <p>He is one of two dictators in the book with dynastic ambitions for their sons, the other \u2013 and more successful over the long term \u2013 being Kim. That seems to me an important difference from the others, including all the \u201cbig\u201d ones, but Dik\u00f6tter does not remark on it. Overall, his argument is that dictators\u2019 cults are not peripheral phenomena but lie \u201cat the very heart of tyranny\u201d. He holds that, contrary to widespread belief, the dictators had not \u201ccaptured the souls of their subjects and \u2026 cast a spell on them\u201d. \u201cThere never was a spell. There was fear, and when it evaporated the entire edifice collapsed.\u201d This seems a strange conclusion when it comes to Stalin, whose successors wrestled with his legacy for decades, and an even stranger one for Mao, the dictator closest to Dik\u00f6tter own field of expertise. But denying any contemporary popularity or lasting impact to the dictators seems to be the main point of the book.</p> <p>While Dik\u00f6tter is explicitly dealing with 20th-century dictators, the stage is set in the preface by France\u2019s 18th-century Sun King, Louis XIV, a great practitioner of political theatre, remembered for his aphorism \u201c<em>L\u2019\u00c9tat, c\u2019est moi</em>\u201d. But if Louis was a model for any of the 20th-century dictators, we don\u2019t hear of it in this book. For that matter we learn little about whom the dictators modelled themselves on (or against) and how they reacted to each other. Yet surely Mussolini, Hitler and Stalin kept an interested eye on each other\u2019s PR practices and on occasion quietly imitated them; and Mao was scarcely indifferent to Stalin\u2019s example.</p> <p>Questions of chronology, sequence and influence are not much discussed here. The mid 20th century is generally considered the heyday of dictators of the right and the left, but Dik\u00f6tter does not explore why this might have been so, and even obscures the issue by including chronological outliers such as Mengistu. It is important to study dictators, he suggests, because they are an eternal threat to democracy and freedom \u2013 but not, it seems an acute current threat. \u201cDictators today, with the exception of Kim Jong-un, are a long way from instilling the fear their predecessors inflicted on their population at the height of the twentieth century \u2026 Even a modicum of historical perspective indicates that today dictatorship is on the decline.\u201d That\u2019s reassuring.

Murphy\u2019s 2018 mega-deal with Netflix sealed his title as \u201cthe most powerful man in TV\u201d, but he has earned his crown creating groundbreaking shows both about and starring people whom TV has traditionally ignored.</p> <p>Before the first episode even aired, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/mar/21/pose-review-ryan-murphy-show-voguing-underground-ballroom-new-york\">Pose</a> was already making history, with five of the leads \u2013 Indya Moore, Mj Rodriguez, Dominique Jackson, Hailie Sahar and Angelica Ross \u2013 played by transgender women, and another 45 trans performers cast in the wider ensemble, the most ever in a scripted television show. Season two jumps forward 18 months to the summer of 1990, when Madonna\u2019s Vogue was No 1 in the charts, and ballroom culture was going mainstream.

      "bodyText": "It is a rainy Friday morning on an unprepossessing street in the Bronx. Step inside the squat, utilitarian collection of buildings, however, and it\u2019s a very different story. Statuesque, extravagantly coiffed figures strut about the corridors in wigs, sequins and retro block-colour suits. Elsewhere, lithe dancers in garish-glamorous leisurewear languidly limber up, presided over by MC Pray Tell (recent Emmy winner Billy Porter), in an extravagant ensemble befitting a pearly king. In the middle of it all, underneath the biggest disco ball imaginable, is powerhouse television hit-maker Ryan Murphy. We are on the set of Pose, Murphy\u2019s flamboyant drama (co-created with long-term collaborator Brad Falchuk) set in the New York underground ballroom scene of the late 1980s, and his latest bid to capture the zeitgeist through a story from the recent past. Murphy\u2019s 2018 mega-deal with Netflix sealed his title as \u201cthe most powerful man in TV\u201d, but he has earned his crown creating groundbreaking shows both about and starring people whom TV has traditionally ignored. Before the first episode even aired, Pose was already making history, with five of the leads \u2013 Indya Moore, Mj Rodriguez, Dominique Jackson, Hailie Sahar and Angelica Ross \u2013 played by transgender women, and another 45 trans performers cast in the wider ensemble, the most ever in a scripted television show. Season two jumps forward 18 months to the summer of 1990, when Madonna\u2019s Vogue was No 1 in the charts, and ballroom culture was going mainstream. Yet it was also a time when New York\u2019s LGBTQ community was hit by the HIV/Aids emergency. \u201cI was interested in the idea of a community in crisis and under siege,\u201d says Murphy, who is also directing today\u2019s episode. \u201cThe medications that have helped stop the plague, the holocaust, came out in 1996, so I hope to end the show right as that happened, to really show the decimation of a world.\u201d A self-declared \u201cgay kid from Indiana who moved to Hollywood in 1989 with $55 in savings in my pocket\u201d, Murphy has always been drawn to the margins. And, difficult though it may be to recall, there once was a time when \u2013 rather than the man who, last February, signed a whopping $300m deal with Netflix \u2013 he was \u201csomebody who couldn\u2019t sell a script and was being told that everything I did was too gay or too out-there\u201d. The feedback did not cause him to deviate from his vision. \u201cI only wrote or created shows that I really wanted to watch, so they inevitably had gay characters and trans characters and minorities,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I made them the leads instead of the sidekicks, because that is what I did in my own life.\u201d Murphy, 53, has been writing for a living since his late teens, first working as an entertainment journalist before moving into screenwriting in the late 1990s with the teen comedy Popular. He truly came to prominence, however, with Nip/Tuck, his dark psychological comedy set in a plastic-surgery practice. Since then, he has indisputably changed the industry, taking mainstream his offbeat celebration of the camp with high-school pep-squad musical comedy-drama Glee, teen murder mystery Scream Queens, and the miniseries Feud: Bette and Joan, a colourful dramatisation of the rivalry between Bette Davis (Susan Sarandon) and Joan Crawford (Jessica Lange) during the making of Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?. If that wasn\u2019t enough, Murphy is also responsible for popularising the much-imitated anthology format both with the twisted American Horror Story, which features a rotating cast of Murphy regulars (Sarah Paulson, Jessica Lange, Kathy Bates) in a range of ghoulish setups, and the ripped-from-the-headlines American Crime Story, which has earned acclaim for its retelling of the OJ Simpson trial and the 1997 murder of Gianni Versace. But, beyond the colourful content and genre-busting approach to format, what makes Murphy most notable is what his collaborator, the writer, producer and director Janet Mock \u2013 with Pose, the first trans woman of colour in the writers\u2019 room of a Hollywood television series, and also the first to direct an episode of a TV show \u2013 calls \u201cshowrunning as advocacy\u201d. With his radical, pro-LGBTQ hiring policies and representation, Murphy is changing the face of the industry, on both sides of the camera. \u201cI think I only really began to understand the power of the medium around the time of OJ and The Normal Heart [the film Murphy directed about the Aids crisis in New York City in the 1980s],\u201d he says, speaking in front of a red glitter curtain between takes. \u201cThe Normal Heart aired, and I remember looking at Twitter, and so many young people had posted about it, saying: \u2018I had no idea this happened.\u2019 And then I saw it with OJ, with the rehabilitation of [prosecutor] Marcia Clark, from shill to feminist hero.\u201d With Pose, he says, \u201cthe whole theme of the show is: what does it feel like when you are invited to the party, when you suddenly have a place at the table?

      "body": "<p>A decade ago, paddleboarding was something people did on holiday, or if they were American. Pretty soon, it started to spring up anywhere there was a canal, unless it was a filthy canal, and before long it was available at music festivals. This sealed its place, for me, as a bit of a hipster\u2019s affectation, a way to exercise while still looking countercultural; as if you would never be seen dead exercising (see also in this category: surfing; lindy hop). </p> <p>Paddleboarding is a mix between surfing and kayaking: you stand on the board (about 10-11ft long) and then propel yourself along with the paddle. I have a go in Paddington Basin, which I\u2019m a bit scared of, because the daughter of a policeman told me her father had once found a hand in there. But I\u2019m more scared of balancing on a paddleboard, one of those skills (like parenting or making choux pastry) that you don\u2019t know you\u2019ll be able to master until it\u2019s too late to back out. Yes, you really do have to get off the jetty and stand on the board. You have to brace your abs enough that you keep your balance, but not tense up so completely that you disturb your entire relationship with gravity. In the interests of not tensing up, I imagine it would be a bit easier if you were slightly drunk to start with, but I wasn\u2019t and, again, it was too late.</p> <p>Once you\u2019re on the board, you\u2019ll need a bit of time just familiarising yourself with not falling in. The most useful way to do this is with the mantra: \u201cFalling in is not the end of the world; there are no hands in Paddington Basin.\u201d However, don\u2019t spend too long doing this: the momentum of moving has a stabilising effect.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/sep/07/reformer-pilates-zoe-williams-fit-in-my-40s\">Fit in my 40s: I hated Pilates the first time I tried it.

It doesn\u2019t make huge demands on your upper body, and you pick up a fair amount of speed even with novice strokes.

      "bodyText": "A decade ago, paddleboarding was something people did on holiday, or if they were American. Pretty soon, it started to spring up anywhere there was a canal, unless it was a filthy canal, and before long it was available at music festivals. This sealed its place, for me, as a bit of a hipster\u2019s affectation, a way to exercise while still looking countercultural; as if you would never be seen dead exercising (see also in this category: surfing; lindy hop). Paddleboarding is a mix between surfing and kayaking: you stand on the board (about 10-11ft long) and then propel yourself along with the paddle. I have a go in Paddington Basin, which I\u2019m a bit scared of, because the daughter of a policeman told me her father had once found a hand in there. But I\u2019m more scared of balancing on a paddleboard, one of those skills (like parenting or making choux pastry) that you don\u2019t know you\u2019ll be able to master until it\u2019s too late to back out. Yes, you really do have to get off the jetty and stand on the board. You have to brace your abs enough that you keep your balance, but not tense up so completely that you disturb your entire relationship with gravity. In the interests of not tensing up, I imagine it would be a bit easier if you were slightly drunk to start with, but I wasn\u2019t and, again, it was too late. Once you\u2019re on the board, you\u2019ll need a bit of time just familiarising yourself with not falling in. The most useful way to do this is with the mantra: \u201cFalling in is not the end of the world; there are no hands in Paddington Basin.\u201d However, don\u2019t spend too long doing this: the momentum of moving has a stabilising effect. This is not a very technical sport; the paddles go in, at a clean angle, and come out again. It doesn\u2019t make huge demands on your upper body, and you pick up a fair amount of speed even with novice strokes. You can put more welly into it when you\u2019re more confident but, in the first instance, most of your energy is in the muscular effort of keeping your balance, plus the intellectual donkey work of relentless self-congratulation: here I am, moving along through water with my own brute strength. Ah, here I am again: behold my tremendous thighs, which would normally be giving up on this mini-squat position, were it not for the watery peril. It reminded me a bit of callanetics, the huge 1980s weight-loss trend: the theory behind it was that tiny, pulsing movements, repeated over an hour, would help tone you.

Conventional wisdom holds that, in the wake of the damning testimony of the acting ambassador to Ukraine, Bill Taylor, of a quid pro quo, House Democrats\u2019 inquiry will inevitably result in Trump\u2019s impeachment before the end of this year but the Republican-controlled Senate will then acquit him. \u201cI do think the House will send it over to the Senate for a trial,\u201d Weld said before a recent campaign stop in New Hampshire. \u201cI don\u2019t really have a prediction on the Senate. I have no idea what the chances are. \u201cA straw in the wind was provided by former senator [Jeff] Flake of Arizona recently when he said if there was a secret ballot, there would be 30 to 35 votes to convict. Well, all you need is 20. I think from Senator Flake that was a trial balloon to plant the idea in Leader [Mitch] McConnell\u2019s head that maybe a secret ballot would inform his judgment. If they go to a secret ballot, I think you could see some real movement.\u201d A secret ballot could shield some Republicans from the wrath of Trump\u2019s fervent base ahead of primary elections. Few have been willing to speak out against Trump over the past two and a half years, although his decision to withdraw US troops from Syria, and his abortive attempt to host the next G7 summit at one of his properties, sparked rare dissent this month. Weld, who at 74 is a year older than Trump, has been here before. Along with Hillary Clinton, a fellow aspiring lawyer at the time, he was on a bipartisan team recruited by the House judiciary committee to write a congressional memo entitled Constitutional Grounds for Presidential Impeachment during the Watergate scandal of the 1970s. \ufeff Watergate eventually led to the resignation of former president Richard Nixon before he could be impeached. Trump\u2019s actions have been even more egregious, Weld argues, because they invited foreign interference in American democracy and, in his view, are tantamount to treason. \u201cWorse than Watergate? Almost no comparison. Watergate was a single lie. Did the president know? This is a tissue of lies, to use the British expression,\u201d he said. But Weld does see some parallels between Trump\u2019s predicament and Nixon\u2019s slow then sudden downfall. Weld said: \u201cThe one thing that strikes me most vividly is political and it\u2019s that the president is hanging the members of his own party out to dry in forcing them to go through the draining, even exhausting effort of defending him. \u201cThe Republicans in the Senate were defending Nixon up until the day when the tapes became public and then two days later he had 0% in the Senate. Dick Nixon had won 49 states not so long before that.\u201d He added: \u201cMy sense more broadly, being on the hustings, is everyone\u2019s exhausted by Trump. They\u2019re very tired and so they really don\u2019t want to be forced to wallow in Trump. They\u2019d rather think about healthcare and other issues that have more to do with their daily lives.\u201d Taking the oath of office in 1974, Nixon\u2019s successor, Gerald Ford, declared: \u201cMy fellow Americans, our long national nightmare is over.\u201d Just as it did then, the Republican party can regroup and turn over a new leaf, according to Weld, who has been joined in the primary by the former South Carolina governor Mark Sanford and ex-congressman Joe Walsh. \u201cFirst of all I think all the Republican senators who defend Mr Trump will lose next year so they\u2019ll be very much diminished in their ranks,\u201d he said. \u201cSecond, I think as soon as Mr Trump is gone by whatever mechanism \u2013 whether it\u2019s election or removal \u2013 everyone\u2019s going to say: \u2018That was a bad dream. Is it safe to come out now?\u2019 So I don\u2019t think his influence is going to be permanent. Things can move quickly in a good direction as well as in a bad direction.\u201d",

      "body": "<p><strong>Name:</strong> Michael<br><strong>Age:</strong> 48<br><strong>Occupation:</strong> Big Issue vendor, Bristol<br><strong>Income:</strong> Up to \u00a3100 a week</p> <p>I\u2019ve been homeless and addicted to drugs for most of my life. I started with pot and hallucinogenics and ended up mainly on heroin and crack. I wanted to try everything. I\u2019d say \u201cI won\u2019t try that\u201d, and then I did it anyway. I\u2019ve done everything I said I wouldn\u2019t.</p> <p>In my 30s I was a functioning addict; I worked as a successful chef. But I lost my job when I was caught using drugs at work. I was in a relationship for about 12 years but when we split up I was back on the streets again, which caused me to relapse.</p> <p>Being on the streets isn\u2019t good when you\u2019re trying to be clean. I\u2019ve tried to be clean for a long time. I\u2019m older and more mature now. I\u2019ve been clean for about eight months.</p> <p>The turning point was when an outreach worker found me sleeping in a car park in Clifton, Bristol, one morning. He offered me coffee, said that help was available if I wanted it, and that I could get a prescription for methadone.</p> <p>Within 24 hours I had a prescription and he\u2019d found me a place to sleep in an old council building that turns into emergency accommodation during the winter.</p> <p>I\u2019m now staying in a massive Salvation Army hostel, where I have my own room and bathroom. It costs me \u00a325 a week, which includes bills and breakfast. There are a lot of people here. There are about 30 on my landing and there are four floors with a similar number. I keep myself to myself and spend a lot of time in my room.</p> <p>There\u2019s a shared kitchen at the end of my hallway but I\u2019ve never seen anyone use it. A lot of places offer free food anyway. I have a fridge in my room. My food wouldn\u2019t last five minutes if it was in a communal fridge.</p> <p>I\u2019ve been selling the Big Issue on and off for 15 years. I started again 11 months ago after a Big Issue worker saw me busking in the street and asked whether I\u2019d like to become a vendor.</p> <p>I\u2019d split up with my partner and ended up homeless and wanted to make a living. It\u2019s all right. I have a laugh. I meet people. I don\u2019t have a boss. If I want to take the afternoon off to watch the football, I can. Or if I want to work 15 hours a day, I can.</p> <p>I buy the magazine for \u00a31.25 an issue and sell it for \u00a32.50. Some people say \u201ckeep the change\u201d. My pitch is on the harbour side in Bristol. I have a few regulars who buy it weekly. But a lot are holidaymakers and sightseers. I try and sell 10 to 15 magazines a day.

      "bodyText": "Name: Michael Age: 48 Occupation: Big Issue vendor, Bristol Income: Up to \u00a3100 a week I\u2019ve been homeless and addicted to drugs for most of my life. I started with pot and hallucinogenics and ended up mainly on heroin and crack. I wanted to try everything. I\u2019d say \u201cI won\u2019t try that\u201d, and then I did it anyway. I\u2019ve done everything I said I wouldn\u2019t. In my 30s I was a functioning addict; I worked as a successful chef. But I lost my job when I was caught using drugs at work. I was in a relationship for about 12 years but when we split up I was back on the streets again, which caused me to relapse. Being on the streets isn\u2019t good when you\u2019re trying to be clean. I\u2019ve tried to be clean for a long time. I\u2019m older and more mature now. I\u2019ve been clean for about eight months. The turning point was when an outreach worker found me sleeping in a car park in Clifton, Bristol, one morning. He offered me coffee, said that help was available if I wanted it, and that I could get a prescription for methadone. Within 24 hours I had a prescription and he\u2019d found me a place to sleep in an old council building that turns into emergency accommodation during the winter. I\u2019m now staying in a massive Salvation Army hostel, where I have my own room and bathroom. It costs me \u00a325 a week, which includes bills and breakfast. There are a lot of people here. There are about 30 on my landing and there are four floors with a similar number. I keep myself to myself and spend a lot of time in my room. There\u2019s a shared kitchen at the end of my hallway but I\u2019ve never seen anyone use it. A lot of places offer free food anyway. I have a fridge in my room. My food wouldn\u2019t last five minutes if it was in a communal fridge. I\u2019ve been selling the Big Issue on and off for 15 years. I started again 11 months ago after a Big Issue worker saw me busking in the street and asked whether I\u2019d like to become a vendor. I\u2019d split up with my partner and ended up homeless and wanted to make a living. It\u2019s all right. I have a laugh. I meet people. I don\u2019t have a boss. If I want to take the afternoon off to watch the football, I can. Or if I want to work 15 hours a day, I can. I buy the magazine for \u00a31.25 an issue and sell it for \u00a32.50. Some people say \u201ckeep the change\u201d. My pitch is on the harbour side in Bristol. I have a few regulars who buy it weekly. But a lot are holidaymakers and sightseers. I try and sell 10 to 15 magazines a day. I reckon I work about 50 hours a week and I\u2019m lucky if I make \u00a3100 a week. I do my grocery shopping daily as it depends on how many issues I\u2019ve sold. I don\u2019t do a weekly shop. If it\u2019s a been a good day, I might buy steak and chips. If not, it\u2019s a shit microwave meal. I spend \u00a35 to \u00a310 a day on food. A lot of my money goes on tobacco. I buy two packets a week which costs about \u00a325.

I then decided to transform the villa into an anti-mafia museum and a vacation home for tourists.\u201d Cal\u00ec, moved to Milan in the meantime and says he lost count of the threats. In 2014, a local mafia boss, now a police informant, stated that he had decided to shoot Cal\u00ec with a .45 calibre pistol that year. Fortunately the police arrested him a few days later. Cal\u00ec sleeps with a gun under his pillow and drives an armoured car, but he says he has not given up. His extortionist, the mafia boss Antonino Virruso, was sentenced to 11 years in prison last September. A sign on the villa gate reads: \u201cIn the house, the Mafia has lost\u201d. If you ask him whether the guests will be safe spending the night there, after the hardships suffered by himself and his family, Cal\u00ec points to the dozens of security cameras. \u201cThe only time someone tried to break in, in 2014, an arrest was made the following day. \u201cThere is also law enforcement, who patrol this area and protect me and my customers. The mafia and the Grecos shouldn\u2019t frighten anyone,\u201d he adds. Michele Greco was arrested in 1986. He joined hundreds of other defendants in a large anti-mafia trial that lasted six years and became known as the Maxi-Trial. Greco was charged with ordering 78 murders and sentenced to life imprisonment. He died in prison in 2008, two years before Cal\u00ec bought the villa. The men who orchestrated his downfall are the same two depicted in the photo now hanging inside. \u201cI could care less what Greco must be thinking from hell about what has become of his villa,\u201d says Cal\u00ec. \u201cBut I\u2019m confident that, from heaven, Falcone and Borsellino, just like in that photo, are doubled over in laughter.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A visitor was heading to the exit of the Edgar Allan Poe House and Museum. \u201cThank you for coming to Baltimore,\u201d said Shauntee Daniels, a local heritage official, \u201cwith our rats and all.\u201d Turning in the doorway, the visitor, a middle-aged woman, replied: \u201cI know better than that. I know too many good people here.\u201d Daniels\u2019 rodent reference was an ironic nod to Donald Trump who last July launched a war of words on Baltimore, a black-majority city near Washington. The US president described it on Twitter as a \u201crat and rodent-infested mess,\u201d and a \u201cdangerous and filthy place\u201d where \u201cno human being would want to live\u201d. Not for the first time, Trump moved swiftly on but the victim of his verbal assault could not. Several national and international conventions halted plans to come to the city because of the tweets, according to Al Hutchinson, president and chief executive of Visit Baltimore, a tourism organization that hosted the Guardian last week. \u201cWhen negative comments like that are made, especially on a national platform, they matter, they make a difference,\u201d Hutchinson said. But Baltimore, less than 45 miles from the White House, fought back. The city took out ads in three major newspapers celebrating its positive side. Trump was condemned by a punchy local newspaper editorial headlined \u201cBetter to have a few rats than to be one\u201d. When Trump ventured to the city last month, was greeted by a giant inflatable rodent with the slogan: \u201cTrump is a rat\u201d. Then last week, as Baltimore reeled from the death of congressman Elijah Cummings, a target of Trump\u2019s invective, it so happened that Hutchinson was visiting the White House to make his case to top officials. \u201cWe shared all the good news stories about Baltimore and we asked the administration to be helpful in the travel and tourism conversation, help us to promote this great city, help us to promote job creation, help us to create great travel to this city,\u201d he said. \u201cWe said to them that it was very important that they tone down the rhetoric. We want them to celebrate Baltimore, but the bigger story is we want them to celebrate all great cities in this country because we believe that travel and tourism creates a lot of jobs, a lot of tax revenue comes into these communities, and we need the administration to be a friend of travel and tourism and not a foe.\u201d Hutchinson plans a major rebranding of the city next year intended to pull together its different communities and attractions for the first time. Among the bright spots likely to be highlighted is R House, a food hall and space for pop-ups that opened in an abandoned garage in 2016 and now attracts nearly a million people a year. Thibault Manekin, co-founder of the company behind it, Seawall Development, had been \u201cliving out of a backpack\u201d for six years doing NGO work in the Middle East and Africa before deciding to return here. \u201cI had a completely different appreciation of this city, having left for so long,\u201d he said. \u201cI love the place because of the people. People that live in the city are so resilient. Everybody bets against Baltimore because of shows like The Wire and the way it\u2019s portrayed. But people here love it and are addicted to the place. It\u2019s a small pool and you can have massive impact.\u201d R House allows chefs to rent a space of 300 square feet instead of 5,000 square feet so they can concentrate on cooking rather than the bureaucracy of running a business. One bustling lunchtime last week, Manekin observed: \u201cWithout a doubt, this is the most racially diverse place you will visit in Baltimore.\u201d The 41-year-old rejected Trump\u2019s derisive words about Maryland\u2019s biggest city. \u201cI have two kids. We talked about bullying. If it\u2019s not true, you don\u2019t let it affect you. Our resilience allowed us to move past that quickly and move onwards through action and not words.\u201d Yet crime does cast a long shadow in Baltimore. There have been 277 murders so far this year, following 309 last year and 342 the year before, according to the Baltimore Sun newspaper. A landmark New York Times magazine article in March was headlined \u201cThe Tragedy of Baltimore \u2026 Inside the crackup of an American city.\u201d And some here still carry the weight of the HBO drama series The Wire, which depicted drug kingpins, corrupt politicians and morally exhausted cops with matchless potency, putting Baltimore on the map only to become a millstone around its neck. From schools to infrastructure, the problems are thrown into sharp relief by neighboring Washington, currently enjoying an economic boom, a slew of new hotels and restaurants and even sporting success with a team in baseball\u2019s World Series. But Baltimore residents are unwilling to be portrayed as the ugly sibling. More than 26 million visitors came to Baltimore last year, up 2% from 2017 and 14.6% from 2012.

Castle Water started in Scotland, but has since bought up a number of other water businesses across the UK. Clearly the reason for the transfer of accounts was not clearly communicated in your case.</p> <p>Our intervention seems to have broken the logjam. Thames Water says an admin error meant your property was listed as being non-household rather than domestic so when it sold the non-household customer base to Castle Water you were switched, too.</p> <p>Thames insists: \u201cWe\u2019re sorry for any confusion but are investigating how this has occurred.

After receiving assurances that the mistake would be rectified and that Thames would claim the money we\u2019ve paid to Castle, we received two bills for nearly \u00a31,000 from Thames Water. We have not received any refunds from Castle Water so this would mean paying for our water twice. I have also sent an inquiry to the Consumer Council for Water but have received no reply yet. Our first complaint was in mid July 2019 and I haven\u2019t heard from Thames Water for at least two weeks. GC, London SW6 You are one of many unwittingly caught up in the acquisition of Thames Water\u2019s (supposed) business accounts by Castle Water, which describes itself as a dedicated water retailer to business customers. Castle Water started in Scotland, but has since bought up a number of other water businesses across the UK. Clearly the reason for the transfer of accounts was not clearly communicated in your case. Our intervention seems to have broken the logjam. Thames Water says an admin error meant your property was listed as being non-household rather than domestic so when it sold the non-household customer base to Castle Water you were switched, too. Thames insists: \u201cWe\u2019re sorry for any confusion but are investigating how this has occurred. We are working with Castle Water and the customer to ensure they\u2019re not left out of pocket.\u201d Castle Water has now refunded you \u00a3818 \u2013 based on its tariff \u2013 but the bill from Thames Water was \u00a3874. Thames Water is, in the meantime, offering you an instalment plan. The Consumer Council for Water says Castle Water has remained above the industry average for complaints over the last 18 months. The 88-year-old asked to \u2018prove\u2019 he was over 18 Since August 2018 I have used Amazon to send my uncle bottles of Ricard \u2013 his favourite pastis. He is 88, has limited mobility, no driving licence, no passport and no other form of photo ID. However, Amazon now requires the recipient to present some form of photo ID to prove they\u2019re over 18. He is therefore ineligible to receive certain products. Amazon assures me that there are no exceptions. I think this is unfair and discriminatory. BL, Surbiton, Surrey We sense your irritation over an 88-year-old being asked for documentary evidence that they are over 18. However, online retailers are expected to ask for proof of age to comply with the law. Some may say it is a sledgehammer to crack a nut, others that it is an essential tool to stop potentially harmful and dangerous goods getting into (younger) hands. In England and Wales (with similar rules for Scotland) trading standards has to enforce the law relating to age-restricted products, including alcohol, cigarettes and tobacco, fireworks, offensive weapons such as knives, solvents (all 18) and party poppers, petrol, aerosol spray paints, lottery and \u201cinstant win\u201d cards (all 16). Amazon referred us to its \u201cstrict\u201d age restrictions for delivering alcohol. If an adult over 18 is not available at an address, or an adult cannot show valid photo ID, the item is redelivered the following day. And finally \u2026 CB of Norwich made a second visit to Orkney on the revamped Caledonian Sleeper advertised as a \u201chotel on wheels\u201d. But, she says, it was a great disappointment. \u201cOld rolling stock, filthy and no food or refreshment \u2013 not even drinking water \u2013 until we all made a fuss. After 10 days its head of customer services called \u2026 I felt I had been taken seriously and was happy to accept all the apologies and explanations. I now have two return tickets for my next trip \u2013 using my Cally Sleeper freebies.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The possibility of another general election was met with little enthusiasm by both leave and remain voters in Watford this week, with some saying they had lost faith in the political process altogether. \u201cCarnage,\u201d is how one leave voter described it bluntly, shaking his head at the prospect. \u201cUtter carnage.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a way too divided nation to go down the route of picking a leader again,\u201d he said, adding an election would be an unappealing prospect for a floating voter. \u201cI feel like traditionally [I am] very much Conservative \u2013 Labour. I personally don\u2019t feel like I can associate with either of those now. So then you go down the route of \u2018should I go for a protest vote?\u2019\u201d Others said they could not see the point in voting at all any more. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t vote. Why should I bother to vote?\u201d one woman said. Another woman asked: \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of voting again?\u201d Focus groups run by the thinktank BritainThinks asked a cross-section of voters \u2013 eight from the leave and eight from the the remain camp \u2013 to discuss the state of UK politics for their Brexit Diaries project. Among the questions was how they felt about being sent back to the polls. Sitting around a table in a community centre 15 miles north of London, the leave group went first and showed sheer fatigue at the thought of another election as well as disdain for the two main political parties. One woman rushed to say: \u201cBecause Labour and the Conservatives are so split, I would find anybody who feels passionately about Brexit \u2013 and most people do \u2013 would feel themselves drawn to vote Liberal Democrat, or the Brexit party.\u201d She said that would create a situation of people backing political parties they know very little about in terms of their domestic policies. \u201cThis is why we\u2019ve got to get this issue out the way before we go to an election,\u201d she added. The issue of integrity, or lack of it among politicians, also permeated the discussion. \u201cWe voted for MPs in 2015 and 2017. A lot of them are no longer in the parties we voted for either. Who can we trust?\u201d a member of the leave group asked. And older man jumped in: \u201cThere is no integrity.\u201d While being downbeat about an election, participants of the leave group were surprisingly tolerant of a second referendum \u2013 normally the preserve of a remain voter. On whether there should be a public vote with Johnson\u2019s deal or remain on the ballot paper, three of the eight said they wouldn\u2019t mind that as an option. The bleak outlook on another election did not improve in the remain group either. A young man said: \u201cIf you want another vote it\u2019s the lesser of two evils [compared to a second referendum] but it\u2019s a waste of time.\u201d He added later: \u201cMore red buses, more lies, more politicians\u2019 \u2018BS\u2019.\u201d A woman among the remain participants said: \u201cI feel like the result would be the same. I think it will still be a Tory government. It just delays it further as well which is annoying everyone \u2026 because you just want it over and done with.\u201d Another female participant added: \u201cNothing will change and they are just spending more money.\u201d However, one man thought it could provide much needed clarity and was more positive about the prospect than anyone in the leave group, despite many in that discussion seeing Johnson as a relatively strong leader. \u201cTheresa May was unelected [sic], Boris Johnson was unelected,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I would like a clear general election where you have a party with the most MPs that can pass through bills going forward.\u201d Deborah Mattinson, the founding partner of BritainThinks, said the 16 members of the public had presented some powerful examples of disillusionment which might make any upcoming election difficult to predict. She said: \u201cFor lots of reasons this coming election is going to be particularly hard to call and one of the reasons is people are so disillusioned with all politicians that I think it\u2019s very hard to judge what turnout will look like. \u201cI think a lot of people think, \u2018Well I voted last time, they didn\u2019t do any of the things I asked them to do, I don\u2019t trust them to do what I\u2019m going to ask them to do now, so why bother?\u2019 \u201cThere\u2019s this complete dejection really, and rejection of the process.\u201d",

The situation in northern Syria has become dramatically more dangerous, including for those in the camps, after the US president, Donald Trump, declared US troops would be leaving, paving the way for a Turkish invasion. While the UK government and other European nations have flagged taking advantage of a five-day ceasefire to repatriate their own citizens, the Australian government has maintained its position that it would not risk a single Australian life to retrieve anyone, and that their return could pose a risk to the community. There are about 65 Australians, the wives and children of Isis fighters, in the al-Hol camp, and a group of 36 \u2013 mostly from Melbourne and mostly children \u2013 have formally suggested they could be placed under restrictive anti-terrorism control orders. First reported in the Australian, the offer was put forward this week in an attempt to find common ground with the government. Control orders were established in 2005 under counter-terrorism legislation, but have only been used a handful of times. The orders can be applied to an individual if doing so \u201csubstantially helps prevent a terrorist attack\u201d, or if the person has trained or taken part in training with a listed terrorist organisation, engaged in a hostile activity in a foreign country, or been convicted with terrorism offences in Australia or overseas. Sarah Condon, a lawyer from Stary Norton Halphen, said the offer was not an admission of anything by the group. \u201cIt\u2019s a recognition that community protection in Australia, for obvious reasons, has to take some level of primacy in all of this,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a show from our clients that says we accept that you\u2019re concerned and we understand why. What the proposal does is it rises to meet that concern, by way of all the various mechanism that come within it.\u201d The control order suggestion does not address the Australian government\u2019s concerns about the risk of an extraction operation, which Condon said was a separate issue. \u201cBut our position in relation to extraction process is that we\u2019ve had multiple journalists flooding into the camp this week and by their reports it\u2019s relatively safe during the ceasefire period,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Kurdish authorities have said to us they\u2019ll do everything they can to assist the extraction \u2013 whether that\u2019s delivering people to the border or an embassy in Erbil or wherever. \u201cIn our dealings with the Kurdish they\u2019ve been incredibly careful and helpful \u2026 but the request has to come from the Australian government.

The orders last for a maximum of 12 months or three months if the subject is between the ages of 14 and 18. They cannot be applied on children under the age of 14. Kamalle Dabboussy, whose daughter and three grandchildren are trapped in the camp, said the proposal attempted to find a solution for the women and children within the legal framework the minister had created. \u201cWe were really motivated by concerns for the children, they need to be removed from that environment and we are trying to find a way where that might be possible,\u201d Dabboussy said. Dabboussy represents a group of 63 Australians \u2013 19 women and 44 children \u2013 and said all 19 women had indicated they would accept a control order as a condition of repatriation to Australia. Dabboussy said he understood the government\u2019s position that some of the women, such as his daughter Mariam, were tricked or coerced into travelling to Syria but that others went willingly to the conflict zone. \u201cWithout any admission of guilt, all of the women have agreed to accepting these orders if it means the children can removed from harm,\u201d he said.

      "bodyText": "A Cameroonian journalist who was denied a visa for Australia because the government believed she might not leave has questioned if they made assumptions about her because she is African. Mimi Mefo, an award-winning journalist who is currently based in Berlin and working for Deutsche Welle, was booked to appear at the Integrity 20 conference in Brisbane on Friday. Mefo was due to speak about press freedom and her experiences reporting on the Cameroon conflict, in a speech entitled \u201cWithout fear or favour\u201d. However, applications for a visa were refused because Australian immigration authorities \u201cwere not satisfied that the applicant\u2019s employment and financial situation provide an incentive to return following [her] stay in Australia or to abide by the conditions to which the visa would be subject\u201d. Mefo dismissed suggestions she would seek asylum in Australia, noting she had a two-year contract and a home in Berlin, and was booked to fly on from Brisbane to speak at another conference in South Africa, alongside Nobel prize-winning economist Joseph E Stiglitz. \u201cI\u2019ve been to so many countries in the world where I could seek asylum,\u201d told Guardian Australia. \u201cThere is no way I would come and be in Australia when I have a job in Germany. \u201cI think they took that position based on stereotyped assumptions on Africans and that is totally wrong.\u201d Mefo\u2019s case has prompted widespread criticism of the Australian government, which has made international headlines over its encroachments on the press, including raids on journalists\u2019 homes and offices. The visa refusal occurred in the same week that Australian media launched a coordinated campaign for press freedom. \u201cAustralia seems to be a country struggling in that direction and they might have thought we would bring some of these issues into the limelight,\u201d Mefo said. \u201cThey possibly saw the invitation [to Integrity 20] and saw that it was on press freedom and was organised by a prestigious university in Australia.\u201d Mefo was rejected twice for her visa to Australia.

What do you think he made of you? A bit obsessed with getting as much free food out of the Guardian as possible. Did you go on somewhere? To a pub for one more. And... did you kiss?

The anguish of the decision to stay or leave is eked out through Al-Kateeb\u2019s inquisitive gaze, making this a heroic work of personal documentary. <em>Ammar Kalia</em></p> <h2><strong>Great Australian Railway Journeys <br>8pm, BBC Two</strong></h2> <p>Michael Portillo boards the 2,000-mile-long Ghan Railway, one of the world\u2019s loveliest rides, from the southern harbour of Port Augusta to the port of Darwin on the north coast. En route he discovers the history of the stretch, and meets the indigenous Arrernte people in Alice Springs. <em>Ali Catterall</em></p> <h2><strong>Westwood: Punk \u2013 Icon \u2013 Activist <br>9pm, BBC Two</strong></h2> <p>Originator of the punk aesthetic and now eco-fashion warrior, Vivienne Westwood is the focus of this feature-length doc. Westwood is typically acerbic as candid footage shows the increasing toll running a fashion empire has on the then 76-year-old. Yet there are no signs of her slowing down.<strong> </strong><em>AK</em></p> <h2><strong>Spiral <br>9pm, BBC Four</strong></h2> <p>Another scintillating double bill, and it\u2019s un jeu de two halves.

Though I love the movie, and I\u2019m glad this last-minute rerelease got me off my bum to see it in a cinema a second time, I\u2019d like to issue a clarifying warning to anyone thinking of buying a ticket: manage your expectations!</p> <p>The new footage isn\u2019t added scene work.

Though I love the movie, and I\u2019m glad this last-minute rerelease got me off my bum to see it in a cinema a second time, I\u2019d like to issue a clarifying warning to anyone thinking of buying a ticket: manage your expectations!

      "bodyText": "The Los Angeles weather forecast has been consistent this week: sunny, hot and potentially deadly. LA is known around the world as a beachy paradise, with palm trees lining the streets and perpetually pleasant weather. But the climate crisis has increasingly turned some days into a special kind of hell. For the county\u2019s 10 million residents, the month of October, when blistering heat and dangerous winds combine to make the threat of catastrophic fires a daily reality, has become particularly worrisome. Across southern California this week, residents were coping with what scientists and government officials say is the \u201cnew normal\u201d in autumn: debilitating heat, an endless fire season, mandatory mass evacuations and forced power shutdowns to prevent new blazes. A heatwave this week turned the city of Anaheim, home to Disneyland, into the hottest place in the United States. The Tick fire forced 50,000 people to flee their homes, many in the middle of the night. And with strong winds and temperatures nearing 100F (38C), authorities are bracing for continued fire hazards heading into the weekend. The utility company Southern California Edison proactively shut off power to more than 24,000 customers in five counties on Thursday and could cut power to more over the weekend. Earlier this month, the Sandalwood fire destroyed a mobile home community 70 miles east of LA, killing an 89-year-old woman. The Saddleridge fire north of the city burned nearly 9,000 acres (3,642 hectares), forced 100,000 people to evacuate, destroyed dozens of homes, and blanketed the city with dirty and dangerous levels of smoke. And a separate brush fire in Pacific Palisades threatened multimillion-dollar homes near the beach. \u201cMy dad has a horrible cough, my mom has eye problems, we all have damage to our respiratory systems,\u201d said Maddhi Jayagoda, whose family survived the Holy fire in southern California last year. The extreme conditions of the past weeks have given the 25-year-old flashbacks to fleeing flames. But her typical remedy to anxiety is often not an option \u2013 she can\u2019t go on a run when air is so toxic, it hurts to breathe. \u201cWe don\u2019t have anywhere else we can go,\u201d said Jayagoda, who works at an ad agency in West Hollywood. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re just stuck having to deal with this.\u201d The hazards are on track to get much worse. LA has long been notorious as one of the worst cities for pollution, smog, and traffic, though the state as a whole has made progress in recent years in reducing emissions. But the crisis of wildfires, which release large amounts of carbon dioxide into the air, has dramatically derailed that progress. The Golden State suffered its most destructive year of wildfires in 2018, when more than 1.8m acres (728,400 hectares) burned, 17,000 homes and 700 businesses were destroyed, and more than 100 people died. \u201cWe\u2019re expecting to see more and bigger wildfires if the climate continues in its current path,\u201d said Yifang Zhu, environmental health sciences professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. The climate crisis has created conditions across the American west more favorable for wildfires, including drier and warmer forests. \u201cNow we can have wildfires anytime of year,\u201d said Ed Avol, clinical medicine professor and air pollution expert at the University of Southern California. \u201cThey seem to be longer, more serious and more persistent \u2026 This is becoming a regular way of life for us.\u201d In addition, the expansion of housing in and around high-risk areas in southern California has escalated the risks of fires and put more people potentially in harm\u2019s way. The long-term health effects of fire exposure are uncertain, Avol said. But it is clear that this new norm of heat and bad air looks dramatically different for different populations, in a region plagued by extreme income inequality, poverty, and health disparities. While wealthier neighborhoods and coastal areas tend to enjoy more shade, air conditioning and breezes, inland suburbs regularly overheat and expose lower-income residents to extreme temperatures indoors and outside. That means October can be especially brutal for those who already suffer significant disadvantages. Rita Dunn, a 39-year-old woman who has been homeless and living outside for about two years, is currently sleeping in a makeshift structure by train tracks in the San Fernando Valley, not far from the Saddleridge fire. \u201cI wore these goggles, but it\u2019s impossible to do anything, and you can\u2019t get away from it,\u201d she said, recounting the peak of the fire, which sent hot embers in her direction.

It\u2019s like you\u2019re smoking,\u201d she said. Gary Williams, a 65-year-old Skid Row resident at the URM, said the heat was making people irritable, distressed and prone to conflict: \u201cIt drives you crazy. It does something to your brain.\u201d When the temperatures get above 90F (32C), Joe Nicchi, who runs a popular ice-cream truck in the region, says his business suffers a noticeable drop. \u201cYou would think ice cream does well [in the heat], but people don\u2019t go outside. They go from an air conditioned car to an air conditioned house. We struggle.\u201d Workers at Disneyland adjust their outfits \u2013 removing bowties, vests and other layers \u2013 when it gets this hot, said Chris Duarte, president of the union that represents the employees. For day laborers and domestic workers, many of whom are undocumented and don\u2019t have health insurance, the fires can mean lost work, untreated illness, or hazardous jobs, said Maegan Ortiz, director of a not-for-profit that has assisted immigrant workers affected by the fires. Some workers tend to houses in wealthy neighborhoods after their employers have evacuated, she said: \u201cWe hear about these persistent coughs that won\u2019t go away, tightness in the chest, not feeling like you can breathe deeply.\u201d At Griffith Park, a popular LA destination for Hollywood sign selfies, Tony Garcea said the bad air quality would not stop him from getting exercise: \u201cI almost passed out, but then I found some shade,\u201d he said as he stretched on a park bench.

Maybe a Nationals sweep wouldn\u2019t be so bad for the league, despite the potential missed revenue.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5db37c6d8f0859498cfb38db\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-25T23:20:44.653Z\">12.20am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Preamble</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Well, who expected the World Series to start like this? The heavily favorite Houston Astros began the series at home with the one-two punch of Gerrit Cole and Justin Verlander starting Games 1 and 2. Maybe it wasn\u2019t shocking that the Nationals were able to pull off an upset in Game 1\u2014especially considering that they were coming off a sweep of the St Louis Cardinals in the NLCS\u2014but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2019/oct/23/world-series-game-2-washington-nationals-v-houston-astros-live\">their 12-3 shellacking </a>of Houston in Game 2 certainly seemed like a statement game by a team prepared to make this a short series.<br></p> <p>Needles to say, this makes Game 3 a major deal for the Astros. The number of MLB teams that have come back from an 0-3 start in a seven game postseason series? That would be one: the 2004 Boston Red Sox, who memorably defeated the New York Yankees in that year\u2019s ALCS. The Astros need to win this game, and it doesn\u2019t help that they will have to pull it off on the road, in the district\u2019s first World Series game since before World War 2, against a team that has just won eight straight.</p> <p>The good news? The pitching matchup should favor them. In theory, Houston\u2019s Zack Greinke is as a ridiculously overqualified Number 3 starter as you can imagine and Washington\u2019s Anibal Sanchez is only starting because the Nationals needed Patrick Corbin to come out of the bullpen to help squelch a potential Astros comeback back in Game 1. </p> <p>Of course, Greinke has struggled a bit this postseason and Sanchez has been <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2019/10/25/anibal-sanchez-is-difference-between-nationals-astros-starting-pitching/\">as sturdy-as-they-come </a>for Washington, even taking a no-hitter into the eighth inning against the St Louis Cardinals. Plus, it won\u2019t matter at all unless the vaunted Astros offense can stop stranding runners in scoring position. If the Astros lose today, they will have a bullpen game in tomorrow\u2019s Game 4. They can\u2019t be confident about that.</p> <p>So, this could be the series. Should the Astros survive, they are absolutely talented enough to at least take two out of three here at Nationals Park and take the series back to Houston. If they lose, they could just be playing out the string. Stay tuned here to our liveblog to see how it turns out.

Tomorrow\u2019s Game 4 (or later today\u2019s Game 4 depending on one\u2019s time zone) could go even longer as the Houston Astros will put together a bullpen game against the Washington Nationals\u2019 Patrick Corbin. We\u2019ll have live coverage of that game, and of every game of the 2019 World Series, here at the Guardian. Until then, thanks to everybody who followed along with today\u2019s liveblog, particularly those who contributed. Ciao! Yep, that sounds like what cats do. It wasn\u2019t to be, but even the most hardcore Nationals fan had to know it wouldn\u2019t be that easy. Josh James gets the win coming out of the bullpen for getting one out. Roberto Osuna gets the save. The Washington Nationals remains up 2-1 but Houston is right back in this series. Astros 4-1 Nationals, FINAL Juan Soto takes a ball and then a strike. 1-1. He offers at the next pitch. 1-2. The Nationals are down to their last strike. Oscuna\u2019s next pitch is high and Soto doesn\u2019t offer. Soto also doesn\u2019t swing at the next pitch, but it\u2019s right down the middle. The Astros have won Game 3 of the World Series! Astros 4-1 Nationals, bottom 9th Rendon swings at the first pitch that he sees and hits a foul pop out. That was not ideal and Washington is down their final out. Astros 4-1 Nationals, bottom 9th Eaton hits one right in no man\u2019s land between the outfielders. The Nationals have a runner on base with one out. Astros 4-1 Nationals, bottom 9th Astros closer Roberto Osuna comes into the game to a chorus of boos for obvious reasons. He falls behind Turner 3-1 before getting the benefit of a call on a ball just outside of the zone. The next pitch is fouled off. 3-2. Turner gets a lot of the next pitch, but not enough, it\u2019s just a flyball to the outfield. Astros 4-1 Nationals, top 9th Suero gets Gurriel to strike out looking and we\u2019re heading into the bottom of the ninth. The Nationals need three runs to keep the game going and they have three outs to do it. Astros 4-1 Nationals, top 9th Turner makes a fantastic jumping catch to rob Bregman for the second out of the inning. Astros 4-1 Nationals, top 9th Wander Suero, who has the coolest name on either of the roster, is in to pitch the top of the ninth for the Nationals. Brantley is up to bat. Suero\u2019s first pitch wanders out of the strikes zone. 1-0. Brantley swings and misses on the next pitch then fouls off the next before flying out to Soto. Astros 4-1 Nationals, bottom 8th Gomes cannot. He grounds out to third to end the inning. We\u2019re heading into the ninth inning. Astros 4-1 Nationals, bottom 8th Robles gets called out looking. It\u2019s up to catcher Yan Gomes, who is apparently on the Nationals roster, to see if he can do anything. Astros 4-1 Nationals, bottom 8th Howie Kendrick pops up in the game for the Nationals and he manages to nail one of the submarining Smith\u2019s offerings and poke it down the middle for a one-out single. Astros 4-1 Nationals, bottom 8th Joe Smith will handle the bottom of the 8th, because we\u2019re into the generic name portion of each team\u2019s bullpen. He gets ahead of Ryan Zimmerman 1-2 before getting him to swing at something that is in a completely different zip code of where anybody was expecting it. Astros 4-1 Nationals, top 8th Springer hits a single off of Ross\u2019s foot, this has been a very painful-looking game. Altuve\u2019s next pitch is also right at Ross but it ends up becoming a groundball out. Astros 4-1 Nationals, top 8th Ross, who is still pitching by the way, will now face a pinch-hitting Yordan Alvarez, who pops up to Turner for the second out. Astros 4-1 Nationals, top 8th Chirinos grounds out to start the 8th. Man, maybe these relievers should have started the game, maybe we\u2019d have had a quicker start. Roger Kirkby: The most annoying thing in baseball? It\u2019s got to be \u201clet\u2019s go Yankees\u201d no question, no argument One again, as I\u2019m writing here from the Boston area, I will plead the fifth. Astros 4-1 Nationals, bottom 7th Cabrera gets underneath a pitch and pops it to third. That was some very quick work from Harris and we\u2019re heading into the eighth. Astros 4-1 Nationals, bottom 7th Juan Soto takes a healthy cut and comes out empty. 0-1. Looks at a strike. 0-2. And then can\u2019t check his swing. That\u2019s a three pitch strikeout. Astros 4-1 Nationals, bottom 7th Will Harris come out for the bottom of the 7th? Yes, yes Harris will. Rendon is up with his goal to get on no matter what. At this point, with three down and three innings remaining, the Nationals need baserunners badly. Rendon works yet another full count, the three millionth of the night, and then fouls the next one back. We remain at 3-2. He hits one long but it\u2019s not long enough and Springer gets under it for the first out of the inning. I normally post a version of \u201cTake Me Out To The Ballgame\u201d here but spare me this one indulgence tonight. Astros 4-1 Nationals, top 7th Josh Reddick is up next and he at least makes Ross work, getting into a full count. There seems to be a lot of those in this game, hence the game time. On 3-2 he gets Reddick to fly out. Seventh Inning Stretch time! Astros 4-1 Nationals, top 7th Ross gets Correa to pop up. He\u2019s not wasting any time here. Astros 4-1 Nationals, top 7th Is this \u201cCan You Get To That?\u201d by Funkadelic coming out of the break? Okay this is now the greatest World Series broadcast of all time. That was enough to motivate this blogger, I\u2019ve gotten my second wind here. Let\u2019s do this. Our new pitcher Joe Ross gets Gurriel to ground out to start the inning. Astros 4-1 Nationals, bottom 6th Harris and the rest of the Astros think that they have Eaton struck out on an 0-2 pitch but the umpire calls \u201cno swing.\u201d It ends up not mattering as Eaton grounds out to the end the inning. We\u2019re headed to the seventh\u2026 wait, only the seventh? Miles to go, my friends. Astros 4-1 Nationals, bottom 6th Will Harris is in to pitch with two on and just one out. This feels like the Nationals\u2019 best shot at getting back in the game. Turner just barely stays alive on a 2-2 count, fouling one right of himself. The trainers come in to see if he can keep in the game. He heads back to the plate, even though it looks like that he got hurt in a very, very sensitive area. After gritting his way through all of that, his reward is striking out on a nasty breaking ball. The Tomahawk Chop is something well beyond annoying. Astros 4-1 Nationals, bottom 6th Matt Adams in in here for a pinch-hitting appearance. Matt Adams fall behind 0-2, but Robles does manage to get himself into scoring position with a straight steal. Adams takes two balls, the second of which is nearly a wild pitch. Adams fouls off the 2-2 pitch and then takes a pitch. Brad Peacock\u2019s run another full count and, now, his second straight walk. Guess what, we\u2019re going to have a pitching change! (I warned you.) Astros 4-1 Nationals, bottom 6th Robles is in next and he also works a full count against the deceptive Peacock before Robles gets on base after a checked-swing call goes his way. Astros 4-1 Nationals, bottom 6th And they are doing \u201cBaby Shark\u201d chants at Nationals Park as Gerardo Parra hits for a possibly hurt Kurt Suzuki. Is this really how the song goes? No wonder my friends with kids hate it with a passion. Brad Peacock is in to pitch for Josh James and he gets Parra to strike out on a 3-2 count. Ryan Zimerman narrowly escaping a beaning is a total mood, as they say on Twitter. Astros 4-1 Nationals, top 6th The Nationals intentionally walk Brantley to get to Bregman who grounds out to end the inning. As often happens in Rodney appearances, there\u2019s a lot of drama but somehow no runners score. Astros 4-1 Nationals, top 6th Now the trainers are out for Suzuki whose body has taken a pummeling in the series. There are runners on first and third with still just one out. Altuve takes a strike to start off his at-bat then fouls off the next pitch. He\u2019s already down 0-2 but falling behind in the count doesn\u2019t seem to be affecting the Houston hitters that much tonight. Somehow, Rodney\u2019s next pitch hits Altuve\u2019s jersey but nobody says anything. Springer takes second on the \u201cball.\u201d On the next pitch Altuve grounds out into a fielder\u2019s choice. Tucker gets caught in a rundown but that allows the runners to get to second and third. Astros 4-1 Nationals, top 6th With a runner on third and just one out, Rodney has no choice but to concentrate on his hitter, who happens to be the dangerous George Springer who works a walk. Suzuki barely blocks the ball to keep Tucker from having a shot at coming home. Astros 4-1 Nationals, top 6th Fernando Rodney is pitching, so it\u2019s seat-belt time. Right out the gate, Tucker steals second and then makes it to third after Suzuki\u2019s throw goes into the outfield. Astros 4-1 Nationals, top 6th Kyle Tucker is up, hitting in the pitcher\u2019s spot and he works a full count off a possibly tiring Sanchez who is now at 92 pitches. The 93rd pitch? That\u2019s outside of the zone and that\u2019s going to be Sanchez\u2019s night. I hope you like pitching changes because we\u2019re going to be getting plenty of them from here on out. Astros 4-1 Nationals, top 6th There\u2019s no catching that one! Chirinos hits a home run that stays on the friendly side of the foul pole. The Astros have a three-run lead! Astros 3-1 Nationals, top 6th Reddick hits one into right field but Adam Eaton takes a dive and snowcones it for the first out of the inning. Astros 3-1 Nationals, bottom 5th Zimmerman\u2019s back up and seems to be unaffected by hitting the ground but James\u2019s next pitch is even higher and couldn\u2019t find the strike zone with a Geiger counter, as Tom Waits would say. Zimmerman just fouls off the next two pitches to keep the count at 2-2 with 2 out and 2 on. There\u2019s a conference on the mound. Kind of a key spot, this. The next pitch is somewhere around his shoulders. On 3-2, Zimmerman swings and misses! The Astros escape! Onto the sixth inning! Astros 3-1 Nationals, bottom 5th Josh James is out of the bullpen to face Ryan Zimmerman with runners on second and third. James\u2019s first pitch starts up and out of the zone but hits the top part of the plate. 0-1. James\u2019s next pitch just catches the plate. Absolutely filthy pitch that and the next one\u2026 almost hits Zimmerman\u2019s head. Zimmerman goes down hard and the trainers are in to check to see if he\u2019s okay. Astros 3-1 Nationals, bottom 5th The inning\u2019s down to Cabrera who gets ahead of Greinke 3-1. Just getting him out of the game sooner rather than latter would be a good idea for Washington. He\u2019s been quite good tonight. Well that might help the cause, Cabrera hits a booming double but Eaton has to hold at third thanks to a quality throw by Josh Reddick and that will indeed do it for Greinke. Astros 3-1 Nationals, bottom 5th Juan Soto, showing some plate discipline that belies his age, works a full count but Greinke gets his sixth strike out on his 90th pitch of the game. Soto is angry at himself and the Nationals are in danger of not even advancing the leadoff runner. Astros 3-1 Nationals, bottom 5th Adam Eaton starts off the bottom of the 5th by managing a single on a lowball that he had no business swinging at. Rendon follows that up by flying out on the first pitch he sees. Astros 3-1 Nationals, top 5th The Nationals bullpen is starting to loosen as Sanchez\u2019s pitch count hits the 80s. Luckily for the Nationals, they manage to just barely get Correa out at first on a groundout to short. The inning is over, but Houston got the run they gave up right back. Astros 3-1 Nationals, top 5th Gurriel hits a base hit literally off of Sanchez, it rattles off his glove so there are two on now with two out for Houston. Astros 3-1 Nationals, top 5th Sanchez, still not entirely thrilled by the umpire\u2019s calls, gets Bregman to fly out. Astros 3-1 Nationals, top 5th Sanchez falls behind Brantley 3-1 on a borderline ball call. It\u2019s something of a tight strike zone here. On the next pitch, Brantley singles in Altuve. Astros 2-1 Nationals, top 5th Jose Altuve golfs a low pitch into the outfield for a one-out double. Astros 2-1 Nationals, top 5th Sanchez is back out there and Springer quickly grounds out. I almost called Greinke hitting a home run in this game, but wisely decided against it. (Although theoretically there\u2019s still time.) Astros 2-1 Nationals, bottom 4th Sanchez is hitting for himself here for the Nationals and he fails to get a bunt down, striking out after bunting one foul. Turner then grounds out to the pitcher to end the inning. Martinez might take some heat for not pinch-hitting his pitcher there. Astros 2-1 Nationals, bottom 4th Robles hits a ball that bounces around in the corner and the Nationals are on the board thanks to an RBI triple! Astros 2-0 Nationals, bottom 4th Suzuki is up next and he strikes out yet again. Can\u2019t be the hero every night. Astros 2-0 Nationals, bottom 4th Zimmerman is up and he\u2019s immediately in an 0-2 hole and then, after a ball, hits one sounds like a home run that goes just foul. Zimmerman shows some patience at the plate and works a full count and then a walk. Astros 2-0 Nationals, top 4th Normally I would take this moment to mock National League rules, but Greinke is one of like three or four starting pitchers who are actually worth watching at the plate. Greinke takes some mighty hacks against Sanchez including one at 2-2 that proves his undoing. A 1-2-3 inning for Sanchez. Astros 2-0 Nationals, top 4th And we get a call out from the International Space Station, cheering on Houston\u2019s Astros. Let\u2019s see if that Space Mojo helps their hitters here at the top of the fourth. Well it doesn\u2019t help Chirinos who strikes out. Now the inning\u2019s down to Greinke. Astros 2-0 Nationals, top 4th Man there\u2019s been a lot of drama already. I have no idea how I\u2019m going to get through this game. Reddick is here to start off the inning and he pops up to Rendon for the first out. Astros 2-0 Nationals, bottom 3rd Cabrera is up in a huge spot after that quality at-bat by Soto. He holds up on a pitch outside. 1-0. Greinke hits the corner with his next pitch and then finds the other side of the plate with the third. Cabrera\u2019s already down 1-2 in the blink of an eye. Cabrera now has to protect the plate, fouling off the fourth pitch of the at-bat. Still, 1-2. On the next pitch, Cabrera can\u2019t connect and Greinke gets out of the jam. Astros 2-0 Nationals, bottom 3rd Greinke\u2019s first two pitches to Soto are both balls but the third pitch just catches the plate. 2-1. This feels like a pivotal moment here in the ballgame. Ball three is so high and inside that it pushes him a little off the plate, which is possibly the purpose. 3-1. Greinke\u2019s next pitch is a fastball right down the middle. Soto probably would like that pitch back. 3-2. Greinke looks back the runner, the crowd predictably boos. The next pitch\u2026 that\u2019s way too low and the bases are loaded with two out. Astros 2-0 Nationals, bottom 3rd Rendon is up with a chance to do damage but he hits one up high to the outfield. It\u2019s birthday boy Juan Soto\u2019s time now. Astros 2-0 Nationals, bottom 3rd Adam Eaton is up next, he takes two pitches outside before fouling off a 2-0 offering. He takes another two balls and that will be Greinke\u2019s first walk of the game. Astros 2-0 Nationals, bottom 3rd Greinke has turned himself into one of the league\u2019s most consistent pitchers while managing social anxiety disorder (something which some New York Yankees fans mocked him for during the ALCS). It would be nice to talk about that while he picks up a strikeout or something like that, but instead Trea Turner works a full count against him and hits a one-out single. Astros 2-0 Nationals, bottom 3rd Greinke gets his counterpart to strike out as Sanchez goes out swinging. I\u2019ll be honest here: It would be nice to see Zack Greinke get a win. He\u2019s one of baseball\u2019s best stories. Email from Roger Kirkby: Hi Hunter, sweep? Sweep? Let\u2019s have no talk of that. Twists, turns, fireworks, errors and bullpens are still to unfold. Settle in for the long run would be my suggestion. I said it would be a sweep if the Nationals won tonight. I did, however, also predict that they wouldn\u2019t. So far, Houston is on pace but we have a very long way to go. Astros 2-0 Nationals, top 3rd Two quicks out for Sanchez after a bit of lousy luck on the first two hitters. Brantley steals second on Sanchez after a first-pitch ball. The book is to run on Anibal, the booth takes pains to mention. Correa gets ahead of the count 3-1 but Correa takes a strike for a full count. This feels like a key moment here, to see if Sanchez can limit the damage. He does! Correa swings and misses and the inning is over. Astros 2-0 Nationals, top 3rd Gurriel pops one up for the second out. Astros 2-0 Nationals, top 3rd Bregman flies out for the first out of the inning and Brantley has to head back to first. Astros 2-0 Nationals, top 3rd Why is the booth interviewing Martinez right now? Brantley hits an infield hit that scores Altuve and the booth misses the entire thing. (Oh and the Altuve triple actually ends up being a double and an error, so that\u2019s an unearned run on Sanchez, if you\u2019re a stickler for such things.) Astros 1-0 Nationals, top 3rd Altuve scalds a double just fair\u2026 no wait, the ball rattles around in the corner and Altuve makes it to third! A leadoff triple for Altuve! Astros 1-0 Nationals, bottom 2nd Robles is up next and he takes a solid cut on Greinke\u2019s first pitch. 0-1. Greinke knows that if he gets this out he\u2019ll just have to deal with the pitcher Sanchez next. His next pitch is outside. 1-1. And it turns out he won\u2019t even have to worry about Sanchez, he gets Robles to grind into a double play to end the inning. That\u2019s one way to save a pitch count. Astros 1-0 Nationals, bottom 2nd Kurt Suzuki who broke a 2-2 tie in Game 2 is up now with a golden chance. Greinke gets him to fish on a 1-1 changeup but can\u2019t get him to go on a 1-2 change out of the zone. 2-2. Suzuki fouls the next one off and then hits one super-long but quite foul. 2-2, still. He\u2019s making Greinke work. Suzuki fouls one off AGAIN but Greinke gets first strikeout of the game on a pitch on the corner. One down. Astros 1-0 Nationals, bottom 2nd Ryan Zimmerman, longtime National, gets his first World Series at-bat at home. Greinke gets ahead 0-2 but he can\u2019t get a call on two pitches out of the zone. Zimmerman fouls the next one off. Still 2-2, Zimmerman laces one into the outfield. Runners on first and second and still nobody out. Astros 1-0 Nationals, bottom 2nd Asdrubal Cabrera is up and he gets a leadoff single off of Greinke Astros 1-0 Nationals, top 2nd Springer is up here with a chance to give Houston a 3-0 lead with a single but he falls behind 0-2. Sanchez can\u2019t put him away though and in a blink it\u2019s a full count. He grounds out to end the inning, which could have gone a lot worse for Washington. Still, the Astros are ahead early. Astros 1-0 Nationals, top 2nd This is a solid spot for Greinke, a rare decent-hitting pitcher, who has a chance to drive in a run here while still making an out. Instead, he bunts to get Chirnos to second. Reddick can\u2019t score on this either. Astros 1-0 Nationals, top 2nd Robinson Chirinos is up next with one out and a runner on second. He gets ahead of Sanchez 3-1 and then laces a single. Josh Reddick can\u2019t score, however, so there\u2019s just runners on the corners Astros 1-0 Nationals, top 2nd Josh Reddick is up next with one out and a runners on second. Reddick ignores the first two pitches, both of them balls. He stays patient on the next pitch, but Sanchez gets the call on that one. 2-1. On the next pitch, Reddick drives in Correa! The Astros have a hit with a runner in scoring position! And a lead! Reddick takes second on a high throw to home. Astros 0-0 Nationals, top 2nd Yuli Gurriel is up and then he\u2019s down. He lines out on the first pitch. Carlos Correa, after taking a strike, doubles into leftfield. I\u2019m guessing the word on Sanchez is swing early. Numbers don\u2019t lie. Astros 0-0 Nationals, bottom 1st Juan Soto grounds out to end the inning, both sides have left a runner on second in the first. Try saying that three times fast. Astros 0-0 Nationals, bottom 1st Anthony Rendon is up next, he takes a low ball and then souls off Greinke\u2019s next pitch. 1-1. The next pitch is a called strike, low in the zone. 1-2. Greinke\u2019s next pitch curves a bit out of the zone. 2-2. On 3-2, Greinke doesn\u2019t get a call on what seems like a low strike. Rendon is still alive and he stays that way by fouling off the next pitch. Then he gets a good swing on the next one and makes his way to second base for a two-out double. He might have to thank the home plate umpire for that one. Astros 0-0 Nationals, bottom 1st Adam Eaton grounds out to first swiftly afterwards. Astros 0-0 Nationals, bottom 1st Now it\u2019s time for the Nationals to come to bat against Zack Greinke. Greinke\u2019s first pitch is a ball as his second. And the third. Greinke gets a call on a high slider for a strike one and on the next pitch it looks like Trea Turner has gotten all of it but it ends up just being a scary flyball out. If the Nationals win tonight, it will be a sweep. I\u2019m saying that right now. Astros 0-0 Nationals, top 1st Alex Bregman is up next and he takes a high strike on the corner. Sanchez has only thrown 11 pitches but it feels like he\u2019s thrown just as many to his first baseman. On his 12th pitch, Bregman fouls one off. 0-2. Bregman takes a ball outside. 1-2. The next pitch is a ball and, finally, Springer springs for second and makes it there without a throw. It doesn\u2019t matter, Sanchez strikes out Bregman on the next pitch. The Astros have already left a runner in scoring position, it feels like it would have been less demoralizing if Springer had just stayed on first. Astros 0-0 Nationals, top 1st Brantley is up with one on and now one out, he fouls the first pitch of the at-bat off. Sanchez\u2019s next pitch is a borderline ball. 1-1. Man, he\u2019s absolutely fixated on Springer at first, he keeps throwing to first. On 1-1, the gets Brantley to swing and miss on a high cut fastball. 1-2. The crowd wants its first strikeout of the game. Instead Brantley gets jammed and pops out to Robles. Two out. Astros 0-0 Nationals, top 1st One on for Jose Altuve. After a few throws to first, Sanchez throws his first pitch to Altuve, it\u2019s a ball. Sanchez then throws over to first again. Altuve swings at the second actual pitch of the at-bat, 1-1. He skies one that Victor Robles manages to turn around and catch near the outfield. It sure looked like that one was going to fall. Springer has to run back to first Astros 0-0 Nationals, top 1st Springer starts things off with an infield hit that Sanchez can\u2019t corral but Springer would have been safe at first no matter what. Astros 0-0 Nationals, top 1st Anibal Sanchez, who hasn\u2019t pitched in two weeks, throws the first pitch to George Springer. It\u2019s called for a strike. Game 3 is officially on the way. Of course I trust anybody with the handle The Real Ringo. Peace and love, peace and love. Oh, R.I.P. all of the \u201cJuan Soto Is Only 20 Years Old!\u201d commentary. Today was his birthday, so he is now 21. The positive news it that he\u2019ll be able to legally drink champagne in a clubhouse should the opportunity arrive. Our anthem singer? Well, D.C. Washington. That\u2019s fitting enough. He zooms through it with his resonant booming voice and I dig it. No filler, all killer. 9/10. The crowd seems slightly more into it with the announcement of the Nationals starters. No Howie Kendrick in the lineup for Washington as Asdrubal Cabrera is in his place in this National League game. 1. Trea Turner, SS 2. Adam Eaton, RF 3. Anthony Rendon, 3B 4. Juan Soto, LF 5. Asdrubal Cabrera, 2B 6. Ryan Zimmerman, 1B 7. Kurt Suzuki, C 8. Victor Robles, CF 9.

Zack Greinke, P Predictions Well last time around I had the Nationals upsetting the Astros in Game 1 but had Houston eventually winning the whole series. I\u2019m pretty much stuck here in predicting that the Astros will flip the script on the Nationals and pull off a road win. I\u2019m guessing, a 6-5 Washington victory, probably in extra innings because it feels inevitable that we\u2019re going to get at least one of those in this series. Agree? Disagree? You can email them to us (to hunter.felt.freelance@theguardian.com) or just tweet them out (@HunterFelt). And, of course, Alex Rodriguez and David Ortiz, who were on different sides of that 2004 ALCS immediately bring it up to start the FOX pregame show. Am I mentioning this for the second time just because I happen to be to blogging here from the Greater Boston area. I will be issuing no further comments on the matter at this time. Sticking to non-sports department An update on the controversy in Houston. The Astros fired assistant GM Brandon Taubman after confirming that he targeted female reporters with aggressive taunts and then lied about his behavior. They have, however, issued no apologies for releasing a statement that discredited the Sports Illustrated writer who broke the story. It\u2019s sounding like Astros owner Jim Crane is attempting to declare the story dead. It should be noted that the MLB is still investigating the incident and how Houston responded Luckily Washington won\u2019t have to deal with any particular cultural fault lines, right? Oh wait, what\u2019s that? Trump is going to be in attendance if there\u2019s a Game 5 (although he will not throw out the first pitch). Maybe a Nationals sweep wouldn\u2019t be so bad for the league, despite the potential missed revenue. Well, who expected the World Series to start like this? The heavily favorite Houston Astros began the series at home with the one-two punch of Gerrit Cole and Justin Verlander starting Games 1 and 2. Maybe it wasn\u2019t shocking that the Nationals were able to pull off an upset in Game 1\u2014especially considering that they were coming off a sweep of the St Louis Cardinals in the NLCS\u2014but their 12-3 shellacking of Houston in Game 2 certainly seemed like a statement game by a team prepared to make this a short series. Needles to say, this makes Game 3 a major deal for the Astros. The number of MLB teams that have come back from an 0-3 start in a seven game postseason series? That would be one: the 2004 Boston Red Sox, who memorably defeated the New York Yankees in that year\u2019s ALCS. The Astros need to win this game, and it doesn\u2019t help that they will have to pull it off on the road, in the district\u2019s first World Series game since before World War 2, against a team that has just won eight straight. The good news? The pitching matchup should favor them. In theory, Houston\u2019s Zack Greinke is as a ridiculously overqualified Number 3 starter as you can imagine and Washington\u2019s Anibal Sanchez is only starting because the Nationals needed Patrick Corbin to come out of the bullpen to help squelch a potential Astros comeback back in Game 1. Of course, Greinke has struggled a bit this postseason and Sanchez has been as sturdy-as-they-come for Washington, even taking a no-hitter into the eighth inning against the St Louis Cardinals. Plus, it won\u2019t matter at all unless the vaunted Astros offense can stop stranding runners in scoring position. If the Astros lose today, they will have a bullpen game in tomorrow\u2019s Game 4. They can\u2019t be confident about that. So, this could be the series. Should the Astros survive, they are absolutely talented enough to at least take two out of three here at Nationals Park and take the series back to Houston. If they lose, they could just be playing out the string. Stay tuned here to our liveblog to see how it turns out. If you would like the contribute, feel free to send us your thoughts either via email (to hunter.felt.freelance@theguardian.com) or on Twitter (to @HunterFelt). First pitch is scheduled right around 8:08pm EST (although I wouldn\u2019t set your watch that that) but we\u2019ll be back well before then. It\u2019s Game 3 of the World Series between the Houston Astros and the Washington Nationals at Nationals Park! Hunter will be here shortly. In the meantime here\u2019s a look back at Game 2, where the Nationals took a commanding two-games-to-none lead.",

She also has hypoxia, and each power outage means she has to use oxygen tanks instead of an oxygen concentrator \u2013 a costly expense. </p> \n  <p>So let this be a reminder that these outages definitely don\u2019t just affect the privileged. \u201cThere\u2019s kind of this myth that disasters affect everyone and they\u2019re this great equalizer and that\u2019s just absolutely not true,\u201d said Samantha Montano, an assistant professor of emergency management and disaster science at the University of Nebraska Omaha \u2013 and in the case of the shutoffs, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/11/california-pge-utility-power-shutoff-disabled\">people with disabilities</a> and lower income suffered the most.</p> \n  <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re middle class and have money in the bank, losing a refrigerator worth of food isn\u2019t great, but you can go out and replace that and be OK,\u201d Montano said. \u201cBut a family living paycheck to paycheck, they\u2019re going to be struggling to be able to replace that food that is lost. That is another example where we\u2019re seeing a disproportional impact.\u201d </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-25T21:41:54.431Z\">at 10.41pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5db34f4f8f08993584c8b671\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-25T19:47:45.645Z\">8.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>My intrepid colleague <strong>Sam Levin</strong> is still on the scene of <strong>Tick fire</strong> evacuations in southern California, and he\u2019s reporting on a crucial issue that often comes up during these disasters \u2013 what to do with evacuees\u2019 pets.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SamTLevin/status/1187809809078243328\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Trish Bathory, 28, says her dog, Zeus, got covered in ash from the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/tickfire?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#tickfire</a>. \u201cHe needs a bath.\u201d<br><br>\u201cI\u2019m trying to tire him out.

Here\u2019s a quick update on where everything stands:</p> \n  <p>The <strong>Kincade fire </strong>in the Sonoma county wine region in the north San Francisco Bay Area has now burned up <strong>21,900 acres</strong> and destroyed 49 homes, businesses and other structures. </p> \n  <p>The <strong>Tick fire</strong> in the northern Los Angeles county community of Santa Clarita has now burned up <strong>4,300 acres.</strong></p> \n  <p>Both fires are only 5% contained \u2013 for those unfamiliar with wildfire terminology, containment means exactly what it sounds like. Firefighters try to establish a perimeter around the blaze to keep it from spreading. It\u2019s tough, arduous work that requires more than just hoses and water \u2013 it\u2019s a lot of digging, pushing flames toward natural barriers like cliffsides, cutting down vegetation and sometimes setting more fire in holding lines to scorch the earth and prevent the uncontrollable wildfire from catching. Containment can fluctuate \u2013 at one briefing the public information officer will say it\u2019s 5% contained and then later in the day it will only be 3% \u2013- that\u2019s because these situations are incredibly fluid and despite the firefighters\u2019 best efforts, wildfires will grow in size and affect containment percentages. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-25T19:44:24.463Z\">at 8.44pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5db347f28f08142786c50fed\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-25T19:16:41.747Z\">8.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Early afternoon summary</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The wildfires are still raging in northern and southern California and folks are in for an anxious Friday and a dangerous weekend.</p> \n  <p>I\u2019m handing over from New York to my colleague in California, Vivian Ho, now, and she\u2019ll take you though the afternoon.</p> \n  <p>Here are the main developments of note so far today:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>California\u2019s largest utility company, <strong>PG&amp;E</strong>, admits it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2019/oct/25/california-fires-wildfires-smoke-spreads-across-san-francisco-area-live?page=with:block-5db3441a8f0859498cfb37fd#block-5db3441a8f0859498cfb37fd\">may</a> have started the <strong>Kincade fire</strong> now raging in wine country.

It\u2019s been a busy day, with firefighters battling blazes from the wine country north of San Francisco to northern Mexico. As we head into the weekend, it\u2019s worth noting that the confluence of weather elements, combined with potentially having to evacuate residents in the face of a power outage, could make for a pretty hairy few days. Winds are expected to pick up starting Saturday night, with speeds that some estimate could reach up to 80mph. In short, it\u2019s a weather event that meteorologists are calling unprecedented. \u201cThis is the kind of event that makes me personally nervous, as somebody who has friends and family living in the fire zones in the Bay Area, and I don\u2019t say that about all the events,\u201d Daniel Swain, climate scientist with UCLA and the National Center for Atmospheric Research, told the Los Angeles Times. \u201cHopefully, we get lucky and there are no major ignitions. But if they happen, it\u2019s going to be really hairy Saturday night and Sunday. It\u2019s looking really, really extreme.\u201d And here\u2019s a quick look back at the afternoon before I sign off for the day: My colleague Vivian Ho took us through what \u201ccontaining\u201d a fire actually entails \u2013 efforts that include \u201ca lot of digging, pushing flames toward natural barriers like cliffsides, cutting down vegetation and sometimes setting more fire in holding lines to scorch the earth and prevent the uncontrollable wildfire from catching\u201d. Gavin Newsom, the governor of California, has issued an emergency proclamation for Sonoma and Los Angeles counties for the Kincade fire and the Tick fire. Later in the day he pledged $75m to help communities prepare for future wildfires and blackouts. The money can go toward equipment like generators or be used to improve infrastructure. Pacific Gas and Electric is considering yet another massive power shutoff across 36 of the state\u2019s 58 counties, starting Saturday evening and heading into Monday morning. Just like the one the took place earlier this month, this one will include parts of Oakland, Berkeley and the coast as well as the Sierra foothills. A fire that sparked in San Diego county tore through the area so quickly that officials had to fly over the neighborhood and tell residents to evacuate the area over a loudspeaker. Parts of Baja California, just across the Mexican border from San Diego, is also on fire, fanned by the same wind event driving fires in southern California. The Mexico Daily News reported firefighters had already responded to more than 100 fires by Friday afternoon. The lights are back on for 99% of the customers who lost power in the latest planned power shutdown, Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&amp;E) reports. As of 5pm, the only customers who remained in the dark are those living in Sonoma county, where the Kincade fire has been burning since Wednesday night. PG&amp;E says about 178,000 customers were impacted by the shutdown, including the Sierra Foothills, North Bay, San Mateo and Kern counties. Here\u2019s a timelapse video of Kincade fire. California governor Gavin Newsom today pledged $75 m to help communities prepare for future blackouts and wildfires. The grant funding can be used to purchase generators and generator connections, fuel storage or backup energy sources or to improve critical infrastructure. Partly because of climate change, both wildfires and blackouts are widely expected to recur, and the one-time $75 mn in funds could help communities offset costs as they prepare for future disruptions. \u201cPG&amp;E failed to maintain its infrastructure and Californians are facing hardship as a result. For decades, they have placed greed before public safety,\u201d Newsom said in a statement. \u201cWe must do everything we can to support Californians, especially those most vulnerable to these events. These funds will help local governments address these events and assist their most vulnerable residents.\u201d In a tweet, Newsom was a bit more pointed in his critique of PG&amp;E. \u201cDecades of greed and mismanagement by PG&amp;E have led us to this moment. Californians are infuriated -- I am too. We just a launched $75 million fund to help communities across our state dealing with these power shutoffs,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. California isn\u2019t suffering alone. Parts of Baja Calfornia, just across the border from San Diego, are ablaze, fanned by the same wind event fueling fires in southern California. Mexico Daily News reported that in the last 48 hours, firefighters have responded to more than 100 fires in Tijuana alone, 19 of them forest fires, and three of them categorized as major. Officials have closed schools in the municipalities of Tijuana, Playas de Rosarito and Tecate as a precautionary measure. In a piece just published, my reporting colleagues Vivian Ho, Susie Cagle, Sam Levin and Joanna Walters team up to take a statewide look at the damage and fear caused by wildfires, including one that has forced the evacuation of about 50,000 residents in suburbs north of Los Angeles. Among the highlights my colleagues\u2019 story: Kathryn Barger, a Los Angeles county supervisor, said on Friday that LA suburb Santa Clarita has undergone its largest evacuation ever. There, crews worked overnight to contain the Tick fire, which started on Thursday and has already charred 4,300 acres and threatens 15,000 homes and businesses. Images and videos posted on social media show flames shooting up residential hillsides, fanned by winds of up to 50mph. Pacific Gas &amp; Electric has announced it plans to shut off power across northern California over the weekend, when gusts of wind are expected to reach up to 75mph. More than 2 million people are expected to be affected by the blackouts. California\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom, declared a local emergency to assist with battling the blazes. Firefighters still face weather conditions that makes battling the blazes extremely challenging. Strong winds, low humidity and high temperatures of up to 90F have come together to create a weather event one meteorologist described as an \u201catmospheric hairdryer\u201d. For some residents, fleeing wildfires has become both gut-wrenching and routine. Sam Levin spoke with Brenda Taylor, a Santa Clarita resident who estimated that her family has had to evacuate eight or nine times in the last 20 years. \u201cIt has become the normal for us,\u201d she said. California has over the past two decades has experienced an upswing of large, dangerous fires \u2013 15 of the 20 largest wildfires in state history have occurred since 2000 \u2013 and they\u2019re most likely to happen at this time of the year, when vegetation is bone-dry and hot, gusty winds whip through the state. The Washington Post has a good description of the way winds contribute to California\u2019s wildfires. This extreme weather event is occurring during the time of year when desiccating and damaging offshore winds tend to rage in parts of California. In northern California, these winds are known as Diablo winds, while in southern California, they\u2019re given a slightly less frightening name: Santa Ana winds. In both cases, they form from weather systems over and around the state that in a certain configuration can funnel air at high speeds through the narrow canyons around Los Angeles, for example, and from mountain peaks to valleys in California wine country. As the air is compressed, it tends to heat up, leading to temperatures along the coastline well above average. Highs in the Los Angeles and San Diego metro areas on Thursday were into the 90s, and Marine Corps Air Station Miramar was the hottest spot in the Lower 48 states, with a high of 102 degrees. And conditions could expected to worsen over the weekend, especially in northern California, where dangerously dry air will combine with strong winds that could reach up to 75mph. Gavin Newsom, the California governor, this afternoon visited the area affected by the Kincade fire, north of Santa Rosa, where nearly 22,000 acres and at least 49 buildings have burned \u2013 and as of the governor\u2019s visit the fire was only 5% contained. PG&amp;E, California\u2019s biggest utility that\u2019s already been held liable for sparking previous fires, says a broken jumper wire was found on a transmission tower near where the fire broke out. Newsom said the area looked like a \u201cwar zone\u201d and took note of the unpredictable way fires tear through communities. Evacuations are underway in San Diego county, where a blaze firefighters have called the Miller fire has broken out. Helicopters are currently circling over the community telling residents over a loudspeaker to leave. The fire started around 1pm and by 1.32pm Cal Fire said the fire was at six acres and burning in heavy fuels, NBC 7 San Diego reported. The NBC 7 meteorologist Sheena Parveen said fast-moving, dry winds could could make the firefight more challenging. \u201cRight now is the worst of it. Things will be getting better as we head through the late afternoon hours and especially as we head into the evening,\u201d Parveen said. Thomas Shoots, a Cal Fire captain, said it\u2019s especially important for those with compromised immune systems to evacuate early to avoid breathing in the smoke. \u201cWhen it comes to air quality, really \u2013 you don\u2019t have to be in an evacuation order area to really experience and have issues. Anybody who already has a compromised immune system, already has trouble getting down to their house \u2013 those people, we want to evacuate early,\u201d Shoots told NBC 7. Mario Koran here, picking up where my colleague Vivian Ho left off. Vivian, by the way, has been in the field for much of the week reporting on the fires from the ground. In all the coverage about power shutoffs and how they\u2019ve been handled by the PG&amp;E power company, one thing it\u2019s easy to lose sight of is the fact that actually being stuck in the middle of a fire would be, well, completely terrifying. Here\u2019s a description of a story from yesterday, where Viv talked to folks camped out at a shelter near Geyserville, north of Santa Rosa, that helps put the fire in a more visceral perspective: At the Healdsburg community center near Geyserville, which became a makeshift American Red Cross shelter on Thursday, evacuees milled around the outdoor spaces, checking their phones and waiting for news. \u201cI\u2019m sleepwalking,\u201d said Tina Tavares, 70. Tavares and her husband, Victor, woke to pitch-black chaos at 5.30am. \u201cYou wake up and they\u2019ve turned off the electricity and all of a sudden you don\u2019t know where you\u2019re going,\u201d Tavares said. \u201cYou go into a wall and you\u2019re feeling around because you can\u2019t feel anything and you have somebody banging on your door saying, \u2018Get out, get out!\u2019 \u201cThe smoke was so thick you couldn\u2019t see my hand,\u201d she said. \u201cAll you could see was red, red, red, red. I just covered my mouth and got right into the car.\u201d Read the rest of the piece here. Passing the blog on to my colleague Mario Koran. In the meantime, take a look at our slideshow of photos from the wildfires: Pacific Gas and Electric is considering yet another massive power shutoff across 36 of the state\u2019s 58 counties, starting Saturday evening and heading into Monday morning. Just like the one the took place earlier this month, this one will include parts of Oakland, Berkeley and the coast as well as the Sierra foothills. Gavin Newsom, the governor of California, has issued an emergency proclamation for Sonoma and Los Angeles counties for the Kincade fire and the Tick fire. Let\u2019s take a look back at the power shutoffs that have been taking place around the state in hopes of preventing wildfires. First, read my brilliant colleague Susie Cagle for some background on what exactly is going on with these power outages: Long story short, California\u2019s utility companies - in particular, Pacific Gas and Electric, the country\u2019s largest investor-owned utility - have a history of sparking wildfires. They have decided to shut off power during high-fire weather in regions with high-fire risk. These outages got national attention this month when they hit the Bay Area. Fair enough \u2013 there\u2019s an irony in the tech-rich Silicon Valley and generally actually dollar-rich wine country existing without electricity. But there\u2019s been talk that these outages affect only the privileged, and that\u2019s just wrong. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m making all of you sit through this blogpost. Yes, California is the fifth-largest economy in the world. Yes, new tech millionaires do street-park their Teslas and flaunt their wealth like it will never run out. But the Bay Area is only a small portion of the shutoff zones. And there were a number of previous outages that occurred around the state before the two massive ones that drew national attention this month. In Butte county, one of the regions most affected by both wildfires and the power outages, the per capita income is $26,000. This was the county that was hit hard by the 2018 Camp fire, and here, 18.1% live in poverty. In Lake county, which was hit hard by the Valley fire in 2015, the per capita income is $23,000. Here, 20.2% live in poverty. \u201cNot everybody can go out and get a generator,\u201d 59-year-old Deanne Mediati told me in an interview earlier this month. \u201cThey\u2019re expensive. These are the easy solutions everybody has, but until you\u2019ve lived it, shut your mouth.\u201d Mediati lives in Grass Valley, where the per capita income is $27,000 and 26.3% live in poverty. She also has hypoxia, and each power outage means she has to use oxygen tanks instead of an oxygen concentrator \u2013 a costly expense. So let this be a reminder that these outages definitely don\u2019t just affect the privileged. \u201cThere\u2019s kind of this myth that disasters affect everyone and they\u2019re this great equalizer and that\u2019s just absolutely not true,\u201d said Samantha Montano, an assistant professor of emergency management and disaster science at the University of Nebraska Omaha \u2013 and in the case of the shutoffs, people with disabilities and lower income suffered the most. \u201cIf you\u2019re middle class and have money in the bank, losing a refrigerator worth of food isn\u2019t great, but you can go out and replace that and be OK,\u201d Montano said. \u201cBut a family living paycheck to paycheck, they\u2019re going to be struggling to be able to replace that food that is lost. That is another example where we\u2019re seeing a disproportional impact.\u201d My intrepid colleague Sam Levin is still on the scene of Tick fire evacuations in southern California, and he\u2019s reporting on a crucial issue that often comes up during these disasters \u2013 what to do with evacuees\u2019 pets. When I was up north at an American Red Cross evacuation center for Kincade fire evacuees yesterday, Sonoma county authorities had the Cuddle Shuttle parked out front for small pets to get out of the heat and rest while their owners figured out what to do. Tina Tavares, 70, who fled her Geyserville home amid a cloud of smoke with her husband, Victor, and two chihuahua mixes, Jake and Savannah, made good use of the Cuddle Shuttle, putting her pups away while she and Victor caught their breath. Hey all, Vivian Ho taking over the blog for now. Here\u2019s a quick update on where everything stands: The Kincade fire in the Sonoma county wine region in the north San Francisco Bay Area has now burned up 21,900 acres and destroyed 49 homes, businesses and other structures. The Tick fire in the northern Los Angeles county community of Santa Clarita has now burned up 4,300 acres. Both fires are only 5% contained \u2013 for those unfamiliar with wildfire terminology, containment means exactly what it sounds like. Firefighters try to establish a perimeter around the blaze to keep it from spreading. It\u2019s tough, arduous work that requires more than just hoses and water \u2013 it\u2019s a lot of digging, pushing flames toward natural barriers like cliffsides, cutting down vegetation and sometimes setting more fire in holding lines to scorch the earth and prevent the uncontrollable wildfire from catching. Containment can fluctuate \u2013 at one briefing the public information officer will say it\u2019s 5% contained and then later in the day it will only be 3% \u2013- that\u2019s because these situations are incredibly fluid and despite the firefighters\u2019 best efforts, wildfires will grow in size and affect containment percentages. The wildfires are still raging in northern and southern California and folks are in for an anxious Friday and a dangerous weekend. I\u2019m handing over from New York to my colleague in California, Vivian Ho, now, and she\u2019ll take you though the afternoon. Here are the main developments of note so far today: California\u2019s largest utility company, PG&amp;E, admits it may have started the Kincade fire now raging in wine country. Its shares took a hit. In southern California, residents of the Santa Clarita valley north of Los Angeles have spoken to the Guardian\u2019s Sam Levin, there, about evacuating from the Tick fire, some by the skin of their teeth. Talk of the climate crisis is in the air. San Francisco and area airports are likely to be affected by smoke blowing down from the Kincade fire. Public schools in the Los Angeles unified school district are closed today, including all those in the San Fernando Valley. The pink stuff Here\u2019s LA county fire department battling to contain the Tick fire. And more smoke coming your way. California\u2019s biggest utility, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, on Friday admitted its electrical equipment may have ignited the ruinous wildfire spreading over the state\u2019s wine country, despite blackouts imposed across the region to prevent blazes. The disclosure came as firefighters simultaneously battled flames in both northern and southern California: the fire amid Sonoma County\u2019s vineyards, called the Kincade fire and a wind-whipped blaze that destroyed homes near Los Angeles, in Tick Canyon in the Santa Clarita valley, labeled the Tick fire. The fire near the northern California town of Geyserville has burned at least 49 buildings and 34 sq miles and prompted evacuation orders for some 2,000 people, the Associated Press writes. It was driven by the strong winds that had prompted Pacific Gas &amp; Electric to impose sweeping blackouts affecting a half-million people in northern and central California. Power was restored to most people by Thursday evening, PG&amp;E said. PG&amp;E resorted to shutoffs after fallen power lines and other electrical equipment were blamed for several blazes in recent years that killed scores of people, burned thousands of homes and ran up billions of dollars in claims that drove the utility into bankruptcy. The PG&amp;E CEO, Bill Johnson, said it was too soon to know if the faulty equipment sparked the fire. He said the tower had been inspected four times in the past two years and appeared to have been in excellent condition. Investors were leery, though, and PG&amp;E stock fell more than 20% during the day. In shutting off the electricity, PG&amp;E cut power to the distribution lines that supply homes, but not to its long-distance transmission lines. High winds in northern California had died down on Friday morning, but they are expected to pick up over the weekend, with gusts of 40 to 60mph in many places. PG&amp;E warned it may black out an even larger region. The PG&amp;E chief meteorologist, Scott Strenfel, said northern California could be in for the strongest offshore winds in years. \u2018With global warming I do worry\u2019 Large wildfires require a cocktail of conditions, such as favorable wind speed and direction, fuel, terrain and, of course, ignition, which can be as simple as a trailer throwing sparks by scraping on a road, my Guardian US environment reporter colleague Oliver Milman wrote in a report after the last bout of devastating wildfires in California. Broadly speaking, however, the climate crisis is making conditions more conducive to wildfires in the American west. Of the 20 largest wildfires in California\u2019s recorded history, 15 have occurred since 2000, at a time when forests have become drier and warmer. Since 1970, temperatures in the west have increased by about double the global average, lengthening the western wildfire season by several months and drying out large tracts of forests, making them more fire-prone. \u201cClimate change is increasing the vulnerability of many forests to ecosystem changes and tree mortality through fire, insect infestations, drought and disease outbreaks,\u201d a major climate assessment by the US government states. Out in Santa Clarita this morning, our reporter in the field, Sam Levin, caught an echo from one evacuee, Jeanne Weiss. \u2018We have everything that\u2019s important to us here right now\u2019 The Guardian\u2019s LA correspondent, Sam Levin, rushed to the Tick fire zone this morning and has been speaking to people who escaped the flames by a squeak. He popped into an evacuation center in Santa Clarita. \u2018There was a wall of black smoke\u2019 \u2018It was the strongest wind we\u2019ve ever experienced\u2019 People who have fled the Tick wildfire in the Santa Clarita Valley about 40 miles from Los Angeles have been talking to my reporter colleague on the spot, Sam Levin. Brenda Taylor, 46, estimated that her family has had to evacuate eight or nine times in the last 20 years. \u201cIt has become the normal for us,\u201d she said, as her two dogs ran in circles and barked outside an evacuation center in Santa Clarita. \u201cThey get really stressed,\u201d she told Sam Levin. She said this was one of the closest calls she has ever experienced. \u201cThe wind was very, very loud and aggressive,\u201d she said. \u201cYou could see the flames. It looked like it was right there.\u201d She said she\u2019s grown accustomed to fleeing fires. \u201cYes this is a home, but it\u2019s a house so let\u2019s just get out,\u201d she said, adding that she grabbed photos and her children\u2019s diplomas. \u201cI\u2019ve just gotten used to it. This is life out here.\u201d \u2018Confident we can put a dent in this\u2019 That\u2019s the most optimistic lens the LA county fire department can put on the Tick wildfire raging now, which began in Tick Canyon (such a pretty name) and has spread \u201caggressively\u201d in the Santa Clarita Valley north of Los Angeles in the last 24 hours. The operations section chief Mike Inman just issued an update saying the fire\u2019s rapid spread was hastened by 30mph winds and it was a 2am \u201csignificant wind event\u201d today that caused it to jump the 14 Freeway on the south-eastern flank of the fire. There is also a northern flank as it spreads west. Inman said the fire crews are battling on the ground but fire retardant issued from aircraft is what they expect will help to contain the fire on both flanks as the day goes on. \u201cWe are confident we can put a dent in this,\u201d he said. Here\u2019s a tweet of the operational update from just moments ago. It\u2019s the climate crisis... Climate scientists warned for several days before the wildfires broke out in California that this would be a week of especially intense fire weather across the state, my colleague Susie Cagle writes. The worse could yet be to come this weekend. Fire risk remains critical across much of southern California through Friday night, and wind gusts reaching up to 90mph are expected in the remote mountainous peaks in the north bay region from Saturday evening through Monday morning. NBC meteorologist Rob Mayeda called the statewide weather event of especially strong winds and low humidity an \u201catmospheric hairdryer\u201d. At an evacuation center in Santa Clarita near the Tick fire, Marcia Cooper Marquez said she was in bed at midnight when she heard authorities on her street ordering mandatory evacuations. \u201cI was in bed thinking this will pass,\u201d the fifth grade teacher tells my colleague Sam Levin minutes ago. \u201cFor awhile everything was good, the winds had calmed. And then it got so bad.\u201d She hadn\u2019t prepared a \u201cto-go\u201d bag, and in a panic grabbed as much jewelry as she could find, including some pieces her husband had made. She also took sentimental photos \u2014 and she grabbed ten library books. \u201cI\u2019m a book lover and a teacher. I didn\u2019t want them to burn,\u201d she said, adding that she realized she forgot to grab important identification documents. She said she was still waiting for news about her neighborhood, but was glad she was safe: \u201cLast night was scary, because I didn\u2019t know what was happening ... but I made it through the night.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know what is happening at my home,\u201d she added. Did utility company start the Kincade inferno now burning in California wine country? Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, the huge utility that provides power to a huge swath of northern California, is conducting an internal investigation into how the Kincade wildfire burning in Sonoma County began. The utility company is not, at this time, taking responsibility for sparking the inferno on Wednesday night, which is still raging out of control today amid bone-dry conditions, high temperatures and strong seasonal winds. PG&amp;E was responsible for the deadliest wildfire in California history, last November, an investigation by the state fire agency Cal Fire found earlier this year. The Camp fire, which killed 85 people and almost completely incinerated the town of Paradise, was sparked by transmission lines owned by Pacific Gas &amp; Electric in the early morning of 8 November, 2018, investigators concluded. \u201cTinder dry vegetation\u201d and high winds \u201ccaused extreme rates of spread\u201d, Cal Fire said in a statement in May. Since the Kincade fire began on Wednesday night, PG&amp;E has filed a report with the California Public Utilities Commission, saying there was a malfunction in one of its transmission towers in the Geyserville area just before the fire started, the Washington Post has just reported. The fires currently burning in northern and southern California are not on the scale at this stage of the appalling and deadly infernos that fried huge parts of the state in 2017 and 2018. The current blazes continue to worsen dangerously, however, as firefighters battle to bring them under control amid erratic, dry winds. Here is my colleague Alastair Gee\u2019s report on PG&amp;E this spring. Reports are coming in that San Francisco airport could start to be affected by smoke from the Kincade Fire as early as 11AM local time today. Oakland and San Jose airports are also expected to have problems today, with the prospect of them worsening as the afternoon proceeds. We\u2019ll bring you more on this asap. Here\u2019s a tweet with air traffic control-related meteorological chat, about expected problems with visibility at the airports today. Evacuation orders remain in effect in Sonoma County Sonoma County sheriff Mark Essick addressed a rumor that had been circulating on social media that evacuations orders had been lifted. \u201cThat is not accurate. All evacuations orders and warnings remain in effect,\u201d Essick said, according to this report in the San Francisco Chronicle. Red Flag warnings for 18 million The National Weather Service in the Los Angeles area notes that Red Flag Warnings, which notify firefighting and land management agencies that conditions are ideal for wildfires to start and spread rapidly, will remain in effect for Ventura County and Los Angeles County all day. Meanwhile, in northern California, around 2,000 people have been under evacuation order as a result of the Kincade fire, around Geyserville, and no new evacuations are expected there this hour. As more than 1,500 firefighters struggle to contain the two main wildfires raging north of San Francisco and just outside Los Angeles right now, tens of thousands of people have already been evacuated and, as the infernos worsen amid powerful, dry winds, thousands more have been waking up today to the prospect that they, too, may have to evacuate. The Los Angeles County fire department is reporting that the so-called Tick Fire in the Santa Clarita Valley, which sprang into life just after 1PM local time yesterday on Tick Canyon Road, is nowhere near contained and jumped a main road artery overnight, the 14 Freeway that runs east-west past Santa Clarita before joining Interstates 5 and 405 that enter Los Angeles from the north-west. Early today, the fire department is reporting erratic winds up to 45mph and temperatures in the 90s F in the region, with low humidity - excessively dangerous fire conditions. Approximately 40,000 residents are currently under evacuation orders and the authorities are working on where people can evacuate. Some 10,000 structures are threatened and so far there are no reports of injuries either to the public or firefighters. Kincade, Tick and many more The two largest wildfires raging in California right now are the Kincade fire Sonoma County in wine country north of the San Francisco Bay Area and west of state capital Sacramento, and the Tick fire just to the north of Los Angeles. There are many smaller fires raging and Time magazine has a report that includes a map monitoring the locations of the different blazes, with live updates. So far, the two main fires have burned up around 30 square miles in total. They are not under control and are getting worse. All Los Angeles Unified School District campuses in the San Fernando Valley will be closed Friday due to smoke and fire concerns. Community, Roscomare, Topanga, Valley View, Wonderland and Elementary schools will also be closed, the district announced, and the LA Times reported today. The Tick fire, on the outskirts of Santa Clarita, just north of LA, has accelerated and, fed by the Santa Ana winds, jumped the 14 Freeway earlier today, rampaging through dry undergrowth. Sky Cornell, a spokesperson for the Los Angeles County Fire Department, urged residents to evacuate when directed by police and fire officials. \u201cWe know people want to stay, but really that does nothing but hurt you and us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need the water pressure and we need the roads clear to be able to get in there.\u201d The National Weather Service in Oxnard reported that: \u201cThe strongest Santa Ana winds will continue to be focused across Los Angeles and Ventura counties Friday morning, with gusts of up to 65 mph,\u201d the weather service said in a tweet. Winds and gusts will be strongest in the mountains, the tweet said, and the weather brings with it \u201cvery rapid fire spread and extreme fire behavior possible with new ignitions.\u201d Latest smoke forecasts from the Kincade Fire in northern California say that smoke is spreading into the Bay Area this morning and will become more widespread this afternoon. The worst of the smoke is expected to sweep down over San Francisco by late morning and into the afternoon. My west coast colleague in Oakland, Susie Cagle, reported overnight that: California is in the middle of a dire stretch of especially hot, windy weather that\u2019s driving wild fires both small and large across the northern and southern regions of the state. In Sonoma county wine country in the north San Francisco Bay Area, the Kincade fire burned more than 16,000 acres in and around the small town of Geyserville, and destroyed 49 structures. Electric utility PG&amp;E had begun rolling blackouts in order to reduce fire risk in the area before the fire ignited, but told state regulators Thursday that one of its still-powered high voltage transmission towers broke near the suspected ignition point shortly before the fire\u2019s start. Fires sparked across the southland throughout Thursday evening and afternoon. In the northern Los Angeles county community of Santa Clarita, the Tick fire forced upwards of 40,000 people from their homes and burned roughly 3,950 acres. County supervisor Kathryn Barger said at least six residences had been destroyed. \u201cBut that number may rise,\u201d she told reporters at a press conference. \u201cWe cannot let our guard down.\u201d",

So on October 26, Wilson\u2019s grandfathers and others briefly held the title deeds, before leasing the park back to the commonwealth for 99 years.</p> <p>The Northern Territory\u2019s chief minister at the time, Ian Tuxworth, made no secret of the fact that he was deeply opposed to the handover.</p> <p>\u201cWe in the Territory believe we have been sold out and compromised by the federal government,\u201d Tuxworth said. He complained that \u201cthe rock was being taken away from all Australians\u201d and given to a \u201ctiny vested interest group of very unsophisticated people who are totally manipulated by a couple of smart white advisers\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/25/uluru-is-a-very-important-place-its-not-disneyland\">Uluru is a very important place, it's not Disneyland | First Dog on the Moon</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Tuxworth claimed that visitors would be locked out of the park.</p> <p>\u201cThis action is wrong and does not have the support of the majority of the Australian people,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Yankunytjatjara man Yami Lester was involved in the negotiations for the handover, and he was MC at the handback ceremony. So much had been made of fears that Anangu would lock people out that he joked: \u201cThanks to all the people who have come to see this ceremony at Ayers Rock. Thank you for coming out to this place to see the rock. By tomorrow that rock will be missing, the Aboriginal people are going to take it away.\u201d</p> <p>Then Lester translated into Pitjantjatjara for the governor general, Sir Ninian Stephen, who told the crowd: \u201cUluru has seen countless generations come and go and, as a national park \u2013 long after all of us here today are long gone and quite forgotten \u2013 will remain for Australians a place of wonder and a place of strange beauty.\u201d</p> <p>It was a happy day.

      "bodyText": "As the sun rose over Uluru this morning, on the first day since Anangu closed the climb, traditional owner Sammy Wilson said the rock would finally have a \u201cwell-earned rest\u201d. Small groups of people were walking quietly around the base, in and out of the spinifex. Police and park rangers stationed in the climb carpark said it was an eerily quiet morning after the hubbub of the past several months. For Sammy Wilson, the day had been a long time coming, a day of reflection. \u201cI am thinking about all the old people who waited for this day to arrive, and who held tjukurrpa (Anangu law) strong,\u201d he said. \u201cThe rock will be resting, so we will feel rested. We often ask, what is it [tourists] are looking for, in doing that [climbing]? We\u2019d like to show them what the place is really about, and for them to learn and understand from Anangu.\u201d It was one of many important days at the rock that form part of a history marked by Anangu\u2019s patience and persistence in the face of disrespect. It is 34 years since the traditional owners were handed the title deeds to Uluru, in a ceremony that marked the end of a protracted land rights battle with the Commonwealth and Northern Territory governments, as well as pastoralists, tourism operators and mining companies. In 1985, the Hawke government agreed to return the land if it was run as a national park under a system of joint management, with a board made up by a majority of Anangu traditional owners. So on October 26, Wilson\u2019s grandfathers and others briefly held the title deeds, before leasing the park back to the commonwealth for 99 years. The Northern Territory\u2019s chief minister at the time, Ian Tuxworth, made no secret of the fact that he was deeply opposed to the handover. \u201cWe in the Territory believe we have been sold out and compromised by the federal government,\u201d Tuxworth said. He complained that \u201cthe rock was being taken away from all Australians\u201d and given to a \u201ctiny vested interest group of very unsophisticated people who are totally manipulated by a couple of smart white advisers\u201d. Tuxworth claimed that visitors would be locked out of the park. \u201cThis action is wrong and does not have the support of the majority of the Australian people,\u201d he said. Yankunytjatjara man Yami Lester was involved in the negotiations for the handover, and he was MC at the handback ceremony. So much had been made of fears that Anangu would lock people out that he joked: \u201cThanks to all the people who have come to see this ceremony at Ayers Rock. Thank you for coming out to this place to see the rock. By tomorrow that rock will be missing, the Aboriginal people are going to take it away.\u201d Then Lester translated into Pitjantjatjara for the governor general, Sir Ninian Stephen, who told the crowd: \u201cUluru has seen countless generations come and go and, as a national park \u2013 long after all of us here today are long gone and quite forgotten \u2013 will remain for Australians a place of wonder and a place of strange beauty.\u201d It was a happy day. But, according to spectators a light aircraft flew over the events, towing a banner which said, \u201cAyers Rock for all Australians\u201d, a popular phrase used by the Northern Territory government at the time. The NT government boycotted the handback ceremony. In the late afternoon on Friday, a long way from the crowds and chaos of the closing climb at Uluru, Sammy Wilson was sitting on a sandhill overlooking his country at Patji. It is a priceless and powerful view: Uluru to the east, Kata-Tjuta to the west, and the Musgrave ranges to the south. \u201cIn 1985 the traditional owners were so happy to get the land back and look after tjukurrpa here,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a time of great celebration, and they went about looking after it according to the law.\u201d Anangu tolerated the climb, but because it traversed several important and sacred sites they patiently explained their preferences with the simple message \u201cplease don\u2019t climb\u201d. A detailed explanation has been part of park information materials and on a large sign at the base of the rock since the early 1990s. The climb was damaging to the rock itself and there were perennial safety concerns. Thirty-seven people died climbing, most from heart attack. It was a challenging ascent made harder by wind conditions and heat. Tourists were injured, others needed rescuing. Climbers left rubbish at the summit and some used it as a toilet. In 2010, an exotic dancer called Alizee Sery was filmed stripping on the summit in a video posted to YouTube. That same year images surfaced of Sam Newman supposedly hitting a golfball from the top of Uluru. In the rains, the human waste left up there washed down, polluting waterholes. The regular stream of minga (the Pitjantjatjara word for \u201cants\u201d is also used to describe tourists who climb) has worked a scar into the rock that Vince Forrester, an Anangu man from Mutitjulu, said he did not think would go away in his lifetime. In 2010, the park board agreed it would close the climb, when it was satisfied that there were enough alternative experiences on offer, or when the proportion of visitors who climbed fell below 20%, or when the cultural and natural experiences on offer were the main reasons to visit. In 2017, the board agreed those criteria had been met, announced it would close the climb, and gave the world two years\u2019 notice. At the time, Wilson was chair of the board and said: \u201cWe welcome tourists here. Closing the climb is not something to feel upset about but a cause for celebration. Let\u2019s come together; let\u2019s close it together.\u201d Sitting at Patji at sunset, Wilson said he was thinking of the old people. \u201cThey were really patient, but they always thought about tjukurrpa, and today with the climb being closed I think about them. \u201cWe\u2019ve continued our story and continued to work towards that over all that time and that actually makes me feel sad, the memory of those old people and the great love they had for land and law and what they taught us. So I\u2019m feeling a bit sad but knowing we\u2019ve actually done what they wanted. \u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019re really happy they\u2019re here in the country and in spirit.\u201d Wilson\u2019s family offers tourism a different side to the country. The Uluru family tours venture is partly funded by their share of the income received from the operation of the park. Traditional owners receive 25% of gate takings and each year they allocate some of their rent income to community development projects.

At Mutitjulu the rent income has built a much-loved public pool. \u201cTjukurrpa is really important to us,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cWe are driving around in motorcars and there\u2019s all these changes to our life, but that\u2019s our belief system.

      "bodyText": "Questions have been raised about the accuracy of the citizenship declaration made by Scott Morrison in the aftermath of the constitutional eligibility crisis that engulfed the last parliament. On Friday the New Zealand Department of Internal Affairs confirmed advice from citizenship law experts that Morrison was entitled to be a New Zealand citizen at the time of his birth \u2013 but that to take it up his mother would have had to apply for him to be registered. Morrison\u2019s office said the prime minister stood by his declaration that he was not a New Zealand citizen. Only the person concerned is able to check the register. If Morrison was not registered, he would not be disqualified by section 44 of the Australian constitution, which prohibits dual citizens from running for parliament. In his citizenship statement lodged with parliament in December 2017, Morrison declared that while his maternal grandfather was born in New Zealand, he was not a New Zealand citizen. This was because the \u201cNZ government website confirms that citizens by descent can not pass NZ citizenship to children they have outside NZ\u201d. Anna Hood, a specialist in immigration law at the University of Auckland, told the Guardian Morrison\u2019s statement was \u201cproblematic\u201d because it did not address the correct basis of his possible New Zealand citizenship. The statement suggested that Morrison\u2019s mother, Marion, who was born in 1943 in New South Wales, was a New Zealand citizen by descent through her New Zealand-born father. If this was the case, she could not have passed citizenship to her Australian-born son. But in fact Marion Morrison was a citizen in her own right, and could have chosen to have Scott registered as a New Zealand citizen. The prime minister\u2019s mother and grandfather would both have become New Zealand citizens in 1948, under the British Nationality and NZ Citizenship Act, section 16 of which made all children of fathers born in New Zealand citizens of that country. The Act specifies that male children born outside New Zealand were citizens by descent \u2013 but females are not mentioned, meaning they were made citizens in their own right, or in legal terms \u201cother than by descent\u201d, and thus able to pass on their citizenship to their children. The New Zealand Department of Internal Affairs declined to comment on Morrison\u2019s case, saying that only the person concerned could check the situation by applying for an evidentiary certificate. However, the department confirmed Hood\u2019s understanding of the law. Prof Kim Rubenstein, an expert in constitutional law at the Australian National University, said the issue highlighted that section 44 was outdated and should be removed or modified by a constitutional referendum. Rubenstein said it was extremely difficult for prospective parliamentarians to check their citizenship status, because of the complexity of relevant laws worldwide. The laws could also change between elections. She said the cost and difficulty of making adequate checks acted as a disincentive for Australians of diverse backgrounds to run for parliament, and the provision therefore \u201cundermines representative democracy\u201d. Rubenstein said recent controversy about the Liberal MP Gladys Liu\u2019s alleged links to the Chinese Communist party confirmed that section 44 was irrelevant. Liu\u2019s loyalties had been questioned despite the fact that she is not a Chinese citizen. \u201cThe politicians say that changing the constitution by referendum is impossible but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case if it is bipartisan,\u201d Rubenstein said. She advocated giving parliament the power to make laws on eligibility, with all MPs and senators required to make public declarations about their citizenship status. These could be referred to by voters, and during parliamentary debates where division of loyalties might be relevant. The parliamentary eligibility crisis began in 2017 when the eligibility of several MPs was questioned. Since then, 15 sitting politicians have been ruled ineligible by the high court, or resigned over the issue. They included then deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce, who was a citizen of New Zealand by descent, and senator Jacqui Lambie \u2013 a citizen of Britain by descent. More recently, treasurer Josh Frydenberg\u2019s status has been challenged in the court of disputed returns because his mother might have been automatically considered a Hungarian citizen, despite the fact that the family were rendered stateless refugees by Nazi persecution. \u2022 This story was amended at 12.30pm on Saturday 26 October to clarify comments from the prime minister\u2019s office.",

      "bodyText": "Kari Paul logging off for the night. Here is the top news of the last few hours: The Republican National Committee voted to publicly support Donald Trump as he faces impeachment, condemning what it calls a \u201cnakedly partisan impeachment investigation.\u201d Lawyers for the whistleblower who outed Trump for his operations with Ukraine said the government operative does not deserve to have their identity outed. Trump tweeted some feelings about iPhone design at Apple CEO Tim Cook this afternoon. Microsoft won a $10 billion contract with the Department of Defenseover Amazon, who had also made a bid for the partnership. The US deficit hits $984 billion in 2019, increasing 26% in the past year under Trump. Have a good weekend, folks! \u2022 This segment was amended on 29 October 2019 because the Department of Defense contract won by Microsoft is for $10 billion, not $10 million as an earlier version said. Kamala Harris is pulling out of a criminal justice forum in South Carolina on Saturday after Trump received an award there on Friday. Harris said she objected to the group\u2019s decision to give Trump its Bipartisan Justice Award for the First Step Act, which has allowed thousands of nonviolent offenders to gain early release from federal prison. Harris received the award in 2016. \u201cDonald Trump is a lawless President,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cNot only does he circumvent the laws of our country and the principles of our Constitution, but there is nothing in his career that is about justice, for justice, or in celebration of justice.\u201d Instead, the candidate said she has opted to hold her own criminal justice roundtable. The US government deficit has ballooned nearly to $1 trillion as of 2019, the Treasury Department announced Friday, growing 26% in the past year under the Trump Administration. In the past year the fiscal imbalance in the US widened for a fourth consecutive year despite a sustained run of economic growth, the Washington Post reported. As the debt rises under Trump, Republicans have had little to say - via the Washington Post: Republican policymakers have made little noise about the deficit under Trump, a contrast with their dire predictions about rising red ink under President Obama. In 2013, when federal debt totaled $16.7 trillion, Trump tweeted: \u201cObama is the most profligate deficit &amp; debt spender in our nation\u2019s history.\u201d The federal government is now more than $22 trillion in debt, according to the White House. Microsoft won a $10 billion contract with the Department of Defense, it was announced on Friday. From the New York Times report: The decision, announced Friday, was a surprise because Amazon had been considered a front-runner to win the 10-year contract for the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, known by the cinematic acronym JEDI. But that was before President Trump began his criticisms of Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon and, for the past several years, the owner of The Washington Post \u2014 a news organization the president refers to as the \u201cAmazon Washington Post.\u201d \u2022 This segment was amended on 29 October 2019 because the Department of Defense contract won by Microsoft is for $10 billion, not $10 million as an earlier version said. Donald Trump seemed to have a suggestion for Apple CEO Tim Cook on Twitter Friday evening, saying the home button on the iPhone was \u201cfar better\u201d than the swipe function on new models. iPhone removed the home button in 2017 with its release of the iPhone X. Representative Ilhan Omar said on Friday she believes Senator Bernie Sanders has \u201ccomplete fluency in the struggles of working people.\u201d Sanders recently secured sought-after endorsements from left-wing favorites Omar and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Omar will be joining Sanders at a Minnesota rally on Nov. 3. Basketball player Charles Barkley said in an interview on Friday Mike Pence \u201cneeds to shut the hell up,\u201d after the vice president criticized the NBA for being too accommodating to China. Pence condemned the NBA for bending to Chinese influence after Daryl Morey, the general manager of the Houston Rockets, landed in hot water for tweeting support of the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong. Although Morey deleted his tweets, league\u2019s Chinese partners quickly suspended ties and state broadcaster CCTV halted all broadcasts of preseason games. Following the controversy, Pence and others accused the NBA of prioritizing business interests over American values, but Barkley noted many countries - including the US - do business in China regardless. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why these holier than thou politicians \u2014 if they\u2019re so worried about China, then why don\u2019t they stop all transactions with China?\u201d Barkley said. The band Weezer will be performing at a campaign event for candidate Andrew Yang in Iowa next week. Yangapalooza will take place in Des Moines Iowa as campaigning in the state heats up ahead of the February 2020 Caucuses. Yang is not the only candidate with musicians backing him. His opponent Bernie Sanders has garnered support from dozens of artists in recent years, including Killer Mike, Diplo, and Cat Power. The identity of the whistleblower who revealed Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to gain intel from Ukraine to aid in his 2020 campaign is no longer relevant, their lawyers argued in the Washington Post on Friday. The whistleblower filed a complaint regarding the president\u2019s behavior in August, which led to a finding the complaint was \u201curgent\u201d and \u201ccredible.\u201d Throughout the process, Trump and his allies have continued to ask \u201cWhere\u2019s the whistleblower?\u201d and the president went as far as suggesting the whistleblower should be executed. The lawyers argue this behavior is \u201coutrageous\u201d and revealing the identity of the whistleblower is not necessary. They noted in the instance of Republican-led Benghazi investigation, there were no such partisan efforts to reveal the whistleblower\u2019s identity. \u201cIn that case, no one threatened \u2014 let alone attempted \u2014 to expose those whistleblowers as a form of retribution,\u201d the lawyers wrote. \u201cThe focus was getting to the truth of what happened, as difficult as that truth may have been for some to accept.\u201d The Republican National committee said on Friday that it \u201cwholeheartedly\u201d backs Trump as he faces an impeachment probe from House Democrats. The party\u2019s governing body voted to express solidarity with Trump, condemning what it calls a \u201cnakedly partisan impeachment investigation.\u201d Trump has sought to align his plight with the entire Republican party and keep GOP lawmakers by his side, telling reporters Friday, \u201cThis isn\u2019t a takedown of the president. It\u2019s a takedown of the Republicans.\u201d The RNC executive committee voted unanimously by phone to approve the resolution. It states that the committee \u201cnow more than ever wholeheartedly supports President Trump and his administration in making America great again.\u201d Traditionally, the party approves resolutions at its twice-annual meetings. \u201cToday, members of the RNC Executive Committee unanimously passed a resolution of support for our president and the Graham-McConnell resolution condemning the unprecedented actions of House Democrats,\u201d said RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel. \u201cHowever baseless this inquiry may be, if House Democrats are intent on pursuing their political vendetta against President Trump, he should at least be afforded the same due process as every other American.\u201d Hello readers, Kari Paul here taking over for the next few hours. More news to come. That\u2019s it from me this week. My west coast colleague, Kari Paul, will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: A federal judge ordered the Justice Department to grant the House judiciary committee access to grand jury material that was redacted from special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report, marking a key legal victory for congressional Democrats. However, the Trump administration will almost certainly appeal the ruling. Two White House budget officials who have refused to testify in the impeachment inquiry were subpoenaed, along with a top aide to secretary of state Mike Pompeo. John Bolton, Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, is reportedly in talks to sit for a deposition in the impeachment inquiry. The funeral for the late congressman Elijah Cummings was held in Baltimore, where a number of prominent Democrats \u2013 including Barack Obama \u2013 delivered eulogies. Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, was heard discussing his need for money and bashing Joe Biden in two separate butt-dial messages left for an NBC News reporter. Hours before the butt-dial report was published, Trump defended Giuliani as \u201cone of the greatest crimefighters and corruption-fighters,\u201d while dismissing longtime diplomat Bill Taylor as a \u201cnever-Trumper.\u201d Taylor testified earlier this week that he was told Ukrainian military assistance was held up to pressure officials there to publicly announce investigations into Biden and the 2016 election. Kari will have more on all of the news of the day, so stay tuned. The executive director of the group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington celebrated the ruling on the Mueller grand jury material as a victory for checks and balances. However, the editor-in-chief of the Lawfare blog immediately warned those cheering the ruling that the Justice Department will almost certainly appeal. Judge Beryl Howell specifically cited the White House\u2019s refusal to cooperate with the impeachment inquiry as a reason why the Justice Department should allow the House judiciary committee access to the Mueller grand jury materials. In a letter written earlier this month announcing the White House would not cooperate with the investigation, lawyer Pat Cipollone told senior House Democrats: \u201cAs you know, you have designed and implemented your inquiry in a manner that violates fundamental fairness and constitutionally mandated due process. ... \u201cIn order to fulfill his duties to the American people, the Constitution, the Executive Branch, and all future occupants of the Office of the Presidency, President Trump and his Administration cannot participate in your partisan and unconstitutional inquiry under these circumstances.\u201d In her ruling, judge Beryl Howell specifically addressed some Republicans\u2019 argument that the impeachment inquiry is illegitimate because the House never held a formal vote to launch it. Howell wrote that this argument, which has been adopted by the White House, \u201chas no textual support in the U.S. Constitution [or] the governing rules of the House.\u201d Judge Beryl Howell wrote in her ruling granting the House judiciary committee access to the Mueller grand jury materials that Congress is \u201cthe appropriate body to resume where the Special Counsel left off.\u201d The Justice Department will almost certainly attempt to appeal the judge\u2019s decision, but her sweeping defense of congressional oversight could still put Trump and his allies in a difficult position. In her ruling ordering the Justice Department to turn over the Mueller grand jury information to the House judiciary committee, Judge Beryl Howell also crucially concluded that House Democrats are in the midst of an impeachment inquiry. This ruling could thus undercut arguments from the White House and some of Trump\u2019s congressional allies that the inquiry is illegitimate because no formal vote was held to launch the investigation. The judge, Beryl Howell, wrote in her ruling that the House judiciary committee should gain access to \u201c[a]ll portions of Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s Report on the Investigation Into Russian Interference In The 2016 Presidential Election that were redacted pursuant to\u201d grand jury restrictions. Howell also gave the Justice Department an Oct. 30 deadline to turn over \u201cany underlying transcripts or exhibits referenced in the portions of the Mueller Report that were redacted.\u201d House Democrats have been fighting for months to gain more access to the information Mueller learned in the course of his investigation. A federal judge has just ruled that the Justice Department must grant the House judiciary committee access to the grand jury material redacted from special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report by Wednesday. The ruling marks a major win for House Democrats, who have fought to gain more access to the information Mueller obtained through the course of his investigation. The focus of the impeachment inquiry has obviously now shifted to the Ukraine controversy, but the grand jury material could potentially provide evidence for the articles of impeachment that House Democrats are expected to eventually file. The report that Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, repeatedly butt-dialed an NBC News reporter immediately sparked a lot of Twitter jokes and a number of unfortunate puns. Meanwhile, NBC News is reporting that Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, repeatedly butt-dialed one of its reporters and was overheard talking about Joe Biden and his need for cash. NBC News reports: Late in the evening on Oct. 16, Rudy Giuliani made a phone call to this reporter. ... The call came in at 11:07 p.m. and went to voicemail; the reporter was asleep. The next morning, a message exactly three minutes long was sitting in his voicemail. In the recording, the words tumbling out of Giuliani\u2019s mouth were not directed at the reporter. He was speaking to someone else, someone in the same room. ... Giuliani can be heard telling the man that he\u2019s \u2018got to call Robert again tomorrow.\u2019 \u2018Is Robert around?\u2019 Giuliani asks. \u2018He\u2019s in Turkey,\u2019 the man responds. Giuliani replies instantly. \u2018The problem is we need some money.\u2019 The reporter noted that, in a separate butt-dial message left more than two weeks earlier, Giuliani can be overheard trashing Biden and his son. The former New York mayor repeated many of the unfounded corruption allegations against the Bidens that Trump has spouted in recent weeks. And it appears that Giuliani has somewhat of a habit of mistakenly calling journalists, per a Washington Post reporter. In his remarks on criminal justice reform, Trump quipped that Jared Kushner, his son-in-law who pushed for passage of the First Step Act, \u201ccould be a liberal.\u201d The president also joked (sort of?) about wishing Kushner, who serves as a senior White House adviser, would \u201cleave me alone.\u201d Trump is currently delivering remarks on criminal justice reform at the historically black Benedict College in Columbia, South Carolina. The president was introduced by Matthew Charles, who said his release from prison was made possible by the First Step Act that Trump signed into law. When the president started speaking, he spent the first few minutes patting himself on the back for the First Step Act and then thanked the Republican lawmakers in attendance. The president singled out governor Henry McMaster \u2013 who, Trump said, supported him \u201cbefore it was fashionable.\u201d Trump added: \u201cI never want to see his approval rating above mine.\u201d Trump is expected to soon start speaking about criminal justice reform at Benedict College, a historically black school in Columbia, South Carolina. However, a large portion of the small audience will reportedly be the president\u2019s allies and guests, ensuring a warm reception. Senator Lindsey Graham boasted that 50 of his Republican colleagues have now signed on as co-sponsors of a resolution criticizing House Democrats\u2019 handling of the impeachment inquiry. It appears that only three Senate Republicans have not yet put their names on the resolution: Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Mitt Romney of Utah. Trump has repeatedly criticized Romney by name in recent weeks after the senator voiced concerns about the president\u2019s communications with Ukraine. In the weeks before Trump released the delayed military aid to Ukraine, a number of Republican lawmakers and administration officials reportedly urged him to do so. CNN reports: In a phone call on September 11, Ohio Sen. Rob Portman made one last pitch to the President, telling him that with the end of the fiscal year fast approaching, if he didn\u2019t act soon there wouldn\u2019t be time to get the money out the door, according to six sources familiar with the call. Trump put up his usual defenses with Portman, claiming the US was getting a poor deal in Ukraine and that European allies weren\u2019t doing their fair share to help the embattled former Soviet republic, the sources said. But in a move that surprised officials from Washington to Kiev, after months of holding up the money the President finally relented. That evening after his call with Portman, Trump released the funds. ... Portman\u2019s call was part of a broader congressional campaign to push Trump to lift the hold on the aid. Vice President Mike Pence -- who was in the room with Trump when he spoke to Portman -- had just returned from a meeting in Poland with Ukraine\u2019s new president and was urging Trump to release the money. While speaking to reporters before leaving for South Carolina, Trump criticized the diplomat who testified in the impeachment inquiry earlier this week and defended his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani. The president said Bill Taylor, the acting US ambassador to Ukraine who said he was told that Ukrainian military assistance was being held up in exchange for public announcements of investigations into Joe Biden and the 2016 election, was a \u201cnever-Trumper.\u201d When a reporter pointed out that Taylor had been selected by secretary of state Mike Pompeo, Trump replied: \u201cEverybody makes mistakes.\u201d Trump also defended Giuliani, who was reportedly involved in efforts to pressure Ukraine to open the investigations, as \u201cone of the greatest crimefighters and corruption-fighters.\u201d The president added: \u201cHe looks for corruption everywhere he goes.\u201d Meanwhile, Trump has arrived in South Carolina, where he will deliver remarks on criminal justice reform at the historically black Benedict College this afternoon. The president was greeted on the tarmac by some of the state\u2019s Republican lawmakers and a group of supporters, but protests against his speech were occurring elsewhere in the city of Columbia. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month that Michael Duffey, one of the OMB officials who has now been subpoenaed by the House committees leading the impeachment inquiry, played a key role in holding up military aid to Ukraine. The Journal reported: While career civil servants put an initial hold on the aid, Michael Duffey, associate director of national security programs in OMB, was given the authority for continuing to keep the aid on hold after the career staff began raising their concerns to political officials at OMB, according to the people familiar with the matter. Mr. Duffey also began overseeing the process for approving and releasing funds, called apportionment, for other foreign aid and defense accounts, according to a public document indicating the change. The House committees also issued a subpoena to Ulrich Brechbuhl, a state department official who serves as a top aide to Mike Pompeo. The depositions of the three officials are set for early November, confirming that the impeachment inquiry\u2019s interviews will continue into next month. Some House Democrats reportedly hope to start public hearings on impeachment in mid-November, but others are skeptical of that timeline as the committees continue to seek interviews with more witnesses. The House committees leading the impeachment inquiry against Trump have subpoenaed two senior White House budget officials who have refused to testify. Russ Vought, the acting director of the office of management and budget, announced in a tweet earlier this week that employees of the agency would not be complying with deposition requests. Michael Duffey, the OMB\u2019s associate director of national security programs who was reportedly involved in holding up military aid to Ukraine, was originally scheduled to testify in the impeachment inquiry on Wednesday. Given that they are currently employed in the Trump administration, it seems unlikely that the officials will comply with the subpoenas. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: John Bolton, Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, is reportedly in talks to sit for a deposition in House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry. Reports have indicated that Bolton raised concerns about Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal layer, getting involved in US-Ukrainian relations. The funeral of the late congressman Elijah Cummings is currently taking place in Baltimore, where Barack Obama just finished delivering a eulogy. Democrats accused the Trump administration of using the Justice Department as a political weapon following reports that the DOJ is opening a criminal investigation into the Russia probe. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned. Former president Bill Clinton just finished speaking at Elijah Cummings\u2019 funeral, and Barack Obama is now delivering his eulogy to the late congressman. Clinton said Cummings\u2019 legacy would be \u201chow ardently he honored his oath to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.\u201d Cummings served as the chairman of the House oversight committee and played a key role in Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry against Trump. A number of political commentators expressed surprise \u2013 and in some cases, glee \u2013 at the news that John Bolton is in talks to sit for a deposition in House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry. Trump\u2019s former national security adviser reportedly expressed concerns about the role of Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, in outreach to Ukrainian officials. The Trump Organization is reportedly considering a sale of its Washington hotel, which has been at the center of a host of ethical concerns since the president took office. The Wall Street Journal reports: The Trump Organization is exploring a sale of the rights to the company\u2019s opulent Washington, D.C., hotel, a move it says is motivated partly by criticism that the Trumps are flouting ethics laws by profiting from the property. President Trump\u2019s family business has hired the real-estate firm JLL to market the Trump International Hotel, Eric Trump, an executive vice president at the Trump Organization, told The Wall Street Journal. ... The company is hoping to fetch more than $500 million for the lease rights, or a price of about $2 million a room key, say people familiar with the matter. That would make the sale one of the highest-priced hotel deals ever by this popular industry valuation metric. However, the sale itself could raise new concerns about conflicts of interest, particularly if foreign investors move to purchase the hotel in an effort to gain influence with the White House. Speaking to reporters on the South Lawn before departing for South Carolina, Trump defended his use of the word \u201clynching\u201d to describe House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry. The president was harshly criticized for using the tern earlier this week, as many accused him of making light of the decades of racist violence that left thousands of African Americans dead. However, when asked whether he would apologize for his use of the term, Trump replied that Democrats had used the term in the past. Joe Biden was forced to apologize earlier this week after a 1998 clip resurfaced of the then-senator calling Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment a \u201cpartisan lynching.\u201d A Democratic congresswoman, Katie Hill of California, is threatening to sue the Daily Mail after the outlet printed nude photos of the freshman lawmaker. The Guardian\u2019s Tom McCarthy reports: Lawyers for Katie Hill, 32, a Democratic, first-term representative from a suburban Los Angeles district, sent a cease-and-desist letter to the Mail demanding that \u2018you remove these photos from publication at once\u2019. The lawsuit, which was first reported by Politico, also suggested that the Daily Mail had defamed Hill by stating that she has a Nazi-inspired tattoo on her body, which Hill denied. The bipartisan House ethics committee opened an investigation of Hill this week for possibly having engaged in a relationship with a staff member in violation of House rules. Hill has said that she had an \u2018inappropriate\u2019 relationship with a staffer. China has responded to Mike Pence\u2019s speech yesterday on the future of the US-Chinese relationship, in which the vice president criticized Beijing\u2019s response to the protests in Hong Kong. Bloomberg News reports: Hua Chunying, a spokeswoman for China\u2019s foreign ministry, blasted Pence\u2019s \u2018arrogance\u2019 and said no force would stop the country\u2019s progress. She accused him of seeking \u2018to disrupt China\u2019s unity or internal stability\u2019 and called Hong Kong, Taiwan and the far west region of Xinjiang \u2018internal affairs.\u2019 \u2018The U.S. has already abandoned and cast aside its morality and credibility,\u2019 Hua said. \u2018We hope these Americans can look at themselves in the mirror to fix their own problems and get their own house in order.\u2019 Pence\u2019s speech came at a crucial moment in the US-Chinese relationship as the two countries continue to engage in trade talks. Trump announced earlier this month that the US and China had agreed on a \u201cphase one\u201d trade deal, but Beijing is reportedly requesting more negotiations before signing the agreement. Kellyanne Conway, a senior adviser to Trump, criticized the process of House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry while speaking to reporters at the White House. Conway said: \u201cIn a constitutional democracy, respectfully, do not get to substance until you go through process ... do you want to skip or subvert the process?\u201d This echoes an argument from many of Trump\u2019s congressional allies who have accused House Democrats of being secretive in their handling of the inquiry, while generally avoiding comment on the quid pro quo allegations against the president. Conway also denied she had threatened a Washington Examiner reporter when she raised the possibility of digging into the journalist\u2019s personal life. Conway said: \u201cIt\u2019s not a threat. I never threatened her ... If I threaten someone, you\u2019ll know it.\u201d Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee, criticized the attorney general over reports that the Justice Department is launching a criminal investigation of the Russia probe. Warner also called for Barr to testify before Congress on the matter, but it seems unlikely that his panel will sign off on that, given Republicans\u2019 control of the Senate. However, the Democratic-controlled House may be inclined to demand that Barr publicly explain the investigation. Nancy Pelosi received a standing ovation when she began delivering her eulogy for the late congressman Elijah Cummings in Baltimore, where the House speaker was born. In her eulogy, Pelosi nodded to Cummings\u2019 significant role in the impeachment inquiry against Trump, given that the Democratic congressman served as the chairman of the House oversight committee. The White House is avoiding questions on John Bolton after reports emerged that Trump\u2019s former national security adviser is in talks to speak to impeachment investigators. Bolton was reportedly critical of Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, becoming involved in relations with Ukraine despite being a private citizen. The sixth Democratic debate will be held in Los Angeles on Dec. 19 and be hosted by PBS and Politico, the Democratic National Committee announced. The DNC has also raised the thresholds for participating, which could threaten the qualification of all but the top five candidates \u2013 Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg and Kamala Harris. Candidates will now have to hit 4 percent in at least four qualifying polls to make the cut. Alternatively, they can qualify by hitting 6 percent in two early-state polls. Candidates must also receive contributions from at least 200,000 donors, but the fundraising qualification has proven easier to hit in past debates. Considering this could be the first time that only the top-polling candidates will face off against each other, it\u2019s unfortunate that viewership will likely be low. The debate falls on the Thursday before Christmas and will be the sixth such event of this election cycle so far. The funeral for the late congressman Elijah Cummings is being held in his longtime home of Baltimore, which he represented in the House for more than 20 years. A number of prominent Democrats \u2013 including Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Nancy Pelosi \u2013 are expected to speak at the funeral. Some of Cummings\u2019 congressional colleagues also offered their memories of him during a ceremony yesterday at the Capitol, where he was lying in state. Barbara Van Gelder, lawyer for White House official, Tim Morrison, just sent the Guardian this line: \u201cIf subpoenaed, Mr. Morrison plans to appear for his deposition. We will not be commenting on what he will say to the Committees.\u201d Morrison\u2019s deposition in the impeachment hearings is highly significant as he is senior director for Europe and Russia in the national security council and is reported to have taken part in the 25 July phone call between Donald Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, which is at the core of the impeachment case. Reports suggest he will confirm testimony by acting ambassador Bill Taylor and other witnesses, saying that Trump was putting pressure on Zelenskiy to investigate his political opponents. Morrison was brought into the NSC by John Bolton. The two share a ultra-hawkish attitude to arms control, opposing constraints on US military might. He is considered a Boltonite, not a Trumpite. The author of an anonymous New York Times op-ed last year, who claimed to be part of an internal White House \u201cresistance\u201d against Trump, is writing a book and reportedly plans to quote from conversations with the president. Axios reports: The anonymous \u2018senior Trump administration official\u2019 who will release a tell-all book, \u2018A Warning,\u2019 next month was a frequent participant in meetings with President Trump and plans to recount specific conversations, sources tell me. The state of play: The author, who has been silent since last year\u2019s mysterious New York Times op-ed, has access to extensive, internal notes that will be revealed in the book, out Nov. 19. \u2018You will hear a great deal from Donald Trump directly, for there is no better witness to his character than his own words,\u2019 the author writes on the book\u2019s back cover. However, if the person intends to quote directly from conversations with Trump, it remains unclear how he or she will maintain anonymity. Mark Esper, the secretary of defense, confirmed that a small number of US troops will remain in Syria to prevent the Islamic State from gaining access to key oil resources. The announcement comes weeks after Trump announced he was withdrawing all US troops from northern Syria and less than an hour after the president tweeted that troops were \u201cCOMING HOME.\u201d This announcement will likely do little to assure Trump\u2019s base that the president is moving to end US engagements in the Middle East. John Bolton, Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, is reportedly in talks to sit for a deposition with the House committees investigating impeachment. CNN reports: Former NSC official Fiona Hill testified before the committee last week that she saw \u2018wrongdoing\u2019 in the American foreign policy and tried to report it to officials including the National Security Council\u2019s attorney, according to multiple sources. \u2018She saw wrongdoing related to the Ukraine policy and reported it,\u2019 one source said. The same source told CNN that Hill testified that Bolton referred to Giuliani -- Trump\u2019s personal attorney -- as a \u2018hand grenade\u2019 who was \u2018going to blow everybody up.\u2019 Bolton also reportedly instructed Hill at one point to tell White House lawyers: \u201cI am not part of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up,\u201d referring to the US ambassador to EU and Trump\u2019s acting chief of staff. Bolton left the administration rather abruptly last month after Trump announced his departure in a tweet, and the former official has since been publicly critical of the president\u2019s foreign policy. Trump seems to be lashing out against reports that hundreds of US troops will remain in northern Syria, despite the president\u2019s announcement that he was withdrawing American forces from the region. The Wall Street Journal reports: The White House is considering options for leaving about 500 U.S. troops in northeast Syria and for sending dozens of battle tanks and other equipment, officials said Thursday, the latest in an array of scenarios following President Trump\u2019s decision this month to remove all troops there. The options, presented by military officials, would represent a reversal from the American withdrawal Mr. Trump wanted. It also would modify U.S. objectives\u2014from countering Islamic State extremists to also safeguarding oil fields in eastern Syria with additional troops and new military capability. However, Trump was on Twitter this morning insisting things in Syria were \u201cgong well\u201d and US troops were \u201cCOMING HOME.\u201d The president is also exaggerating the situation he inherited in Syria. There was never any agreement to completely withdraw from Syria after a month, and US forces only became involved in the country in 2014. Trump is essentially demanding credit for a promise that he has not kept. Good morning, live blog readers! We are almost to the end of a very damaging week for the president, with more evidence of a quid pro quo in the Ukraine scandal coming to light, but it appears that the Trump administration may be using every tool at its disposal to fight back. News broke last night that the Justice Department has opened a criminal investigation into its own Russia investigation, which Donald Trump spent more than two years criticizing as a \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d. The New York Times reports: Justice Department officials have shifted an administrative review of the Russia investigation closely overseen by Attorney General William P. Barr to a criminal inquiry, according to two people familiar with the matter. The move gives the prosecutor running it, John H. Durham, the power to subpoena for witness testimony and documents, to convene a grand jury and to file criminal charges. The opening of a criminal investigation is likely to raise alarms that Mr. Trump is using the Justice Department to go after his perceived enemies. Mr. Trump fired James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director under whose watch agents opened the Russia inquiry, and has long assailed other top former law enforcement and intelligence officials as partisans who sought to block his election. Adam Schiff and Jerry Nadler, the Democratic chairmen of the House intelligence and judiciary committees, issued a statement last night warning that the reported criminal investigation could signal the Justice Department has become \u201ca tool of political retribution\u201d. Schiff and Nadler said: \u201cThese reports, if true, raise profound new concerns that the Department of Justice under AG Barr has lost its independence and become a vehicle for President Trump\u2019s political revenge. \u201cIf the Department of Justice may be used as a tool of political retribution, or to help the President with a political narrative for the next election, the rule of law will suffer new and irreparable damage.\u201d Here\u2019s what else the blog is keeping its eye on: Trump will participate in a criminal justice reform forum in Columbia, South Carolina, before traveling to Camp David. The funeral for the late congressman Elijah Cummings will be held in Baltimore. A number of notable Democrats \u2013 including Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Nancy Pelosi \u2013 are expected to speak. Game 3 of the World Series will take place tonight in Washington as the city\u2019s Nationals play the Houston Astros. The blog will have much more coming up, so stay tuned.",

      "bodyText": "Marcia Cooper Marquez had ignored the calls to evacuate for hours. But when, at midnight on Thursday, police began shouting outside her home in Canyon Country, California, about the approaching wildfire, she scrambled out of bed. She grabbed clothing, photos hanging on her walls, her wedding album, jewelry, and at the last minute, 10 library books. \u201cI\u2019m a book lover, I didn\u2019t want them to burn,\u201d said Marquez, who later realized she had left behind critical documents. The fifth-grade teacher was one of an estimated 50,000 residents in the Santa Clarita area in southern California ordered to evacuate as the Tick fire burned more than 4,000 acres, destroyed homes and spread at a rapid pace on Thursday night. At a Red Cross center on a college campus 30 miles north of downtown Los Angeles, hundreds of evacuees anxiously waited on Friday for news of when they could return home \u2013 and if their houses were still standing. The Tick fire was one of several major fires threatening California this week, as high temperatures and dangerous winds have created hazards up and down the state, leading to mass evacuations and preventive power shutdowns. \u201cIt has become normal for us,\u201d said Brenda Taylor, 46, who estimated that her family has had to evacuate eight or nine times due to fires in the last two decades. Holding her two small, barking dogs at the evacuation center, she said she had developed a routine when fleeing: grab photos of her children, their college diplomas, awards and other sentimental items. \u201cThis is life out here,\u201d she said. Taylor said she and her family did not consider the fire risk when they moved to the area and that this week\u2019s disaster was \u201cthe strongest wind we\u2019ve ever experienced, almost like we were in a tornado\u201d, adding: \u201cThe fire danger is getting more frequent. It\u2019s becoming less predictable. We are really considering, do we want to keep doing this? We\u2019re getting old.\u201d She noted that the region was also continuing to build new housing developments in the area, which is expected to exacerbate the fire crises. \u201cThat\u2019s scary. How bad can it get? I guess we will find out.\u201d Nearby in the parking lot, Nancy Hilliard, 66, was trying to figure out what to do with her seven dogs and five cats she had evacuated the night before. She put her three great danes in cages and bought a large tent to try to give them shade, but the strong winds kept knocking it down. \u201cWe are blowing away,\u201d she said, as she and her daughter tried to fix the collapsing tent. She said she suspected her house would be fine, but she hadn\u2019t heard from a friend who lived very close to the fire. She said she was trying to stay positive: \u201cI\u2019m not going to complain. This is where we live and this is what we have to deal with. I don\u2019t have any control over it.\u201d By midday Friday, the fire had destroyed at least six homes, authorities said. For Trish Bathory, 28, escaping the fire was a new experience. When the retail manager moved to California a year and a half ago, she was worried about earthquakes but had not considered the fire risks. \u201cIt\u2019s surreal,\u201d she said. \u201cNow it seems like there\u2019s a fire every week.\u201d Her dog, Zeus, was covered in ash from the fires: \u201cHe needs a bath.\u201d She was walking the husky around the parking lot, trying to tire him out, so that he might want to sleep. She hadn\u2019t been able to get any sleep since fleeing to the Red Cross center, which had taken in roughly 400 people and set up rows of cots in a gymnasium. \u201cI just want to know when I can go home and when I can go back to normal,\u201d said Bathory. Some recounted harrowing experiences of fleeing smoke, hot embers, and ash raining down and engulfing their neighborhoods. \u201cIt was like I\u2019m in hell. Everything was orange,\u201d said Annick Tuluenga, 17, who fled with her family. \u201cIt just started coming closer and closer \u2026 then there was smoke everywhere.\u201d The Tick fire, which was creating toxic air quality throughout the region, started about a mile from Charles Lindsey\u2019s home. \u201cThere was a wall of black smoke \u2026 then 20- to 30-foot flames,\u201d the 68-year-old said, adding that he tried to protect his home for hours but eventually decided to evacuate: \u201cEmbers in the wind will fly everywhere and do whatever the wind does \u2026 It was blowing straight at us. I saw the glow over the top of the hill.\u201d Before Lindsey evacuated, Southern California Edison had also shut off his power. The utility company and Pacific Gas &amp; Electric in northern California has faced intense scrutiny for their preventative blackouts, affecting more than half a million people. But Lindsey said he was not bothered: \u201cThey\u2019re damned if they do, damned if they don\u2019t. They do what they have to do.\u201d While the fire got very close, Lindsey said he wasn\u2019t worried: \u201cThis is our climate \u2026 I\u2019m a California native. I\u2019ve been through fires.\u201d The cause of the fire was unknown. Sharell Cerda, a 57-year-old nurse, evacuated with her family and six dogs: \u201cWe have everything that\u2019s important to us here right now. Everything else can be replaced.\u201d Her daughter Hunter, 26, added that even if their home survived, she knew this wouldn\u2019t be the last time they went through this: \u201cWe are for sure going to catch fire again.\u201d",
