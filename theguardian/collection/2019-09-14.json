      "bodyText": "That is from me, thanks for following our La Liga coverage. There is plenty more live action on the site tomorrow, including Championship football and Sunday\u2019s Premier League offerings. It is all over (it has been for quite a while). A consolation. How cute. 89 mins: Great commitment from Jordi Alba to get out and block Lee\u2019s shot from the edge of the box. His side are 5-1 but he throws himself in the line of fire, somewhere in the home counties John Terry shows his appreciation. 87 mins: Vidal tries to get in on the act as he ghosts into the box down the left channel. Paulista does well to cut out the cross and Cillessen gathers. 85 mins: This was a contest at half-time but since Pique\u2019s goal Valencia have hardly carried any threat. The defence has not let Gameiro run in behind them this half and ultimately the quality of Bar\u00e7a in attack has overwhelmed the visitors. He sneaks it in again! Barcelona could have scored three times in the build-up to that goal but eventually it comes to Suarez who walks into the strike and sweeps it past Cillessen at the keeper\u2019s near post. That was very clever finish. 78 mins: Gomez goes into the book for a late lunge. Lenglet is still down. 74 mins: That\u2019s not far away from Busquets. I have hardly seen him all game but he has probably just been ticking away in midfield, doing that metronome thing. Suddenly he is curling a shot from 30 yards just wide of Cillessen\u2019s left-hand post. 72 mins: More changes, Rodrigo heads off and Gomez is on for Valencia. Valverde swaps Arthur with Arturo Vidal for Bar\u00e7a. 68 mins: Perez should be booked for a hack on Rodrigo but gets away with it. De Jong goes off for Rakitic in the aftermath. 67 mins: Couple of Valencia changes, Guedes and Torres off, Cheryshev and Kang-in Lee on. Lee almost immediately booked. 63 mins: Cillessen was at fault for the third but he has saved a fifth there. Perez drives at the Valencia defence, creating panic, when the ball is only half cleared it falls back to the forward who drives low and forces Cillessen into an acrobatic save with his feet, Griezmann\u2019s second effort from further out is then gathered well. Who needs fun when you can precision accuracy? On for more than a minute and Suarez has ended this as contest. A dummy on the edge of the box sells his defender then the Uruguayan takes a second swing, curling his shot off the base of the inside of the left post. 60 mins: Ernest Valverde clearly does not like fun. Luis Suarez is on and Ansu Fati, the game\u2019s outstanding player, is off. 58 mins: More probing from Barcelona which only seems to come to life when Ansu Fati gets on the ball. There is a dummy, a feint and the noise rises at Camp Nou. Nothing comes of it but the game is more fun when the kid is on the ball. 55 mins: Semedo cuts into the area from the right and pulls the trigger only to see his effort rebound back off the post. That as such soft defending from Valencia, the full-back was just allowed to wander into the box under non-existent pressure. 53 mins: Alba is cautioned for a shirt pull. What is he doing there? Griezmann\u2019s low strike is fumbled by Cillessen and Gerard Pique is there to poe past the hapless keeper from the rebound. The centre half had must have stayed forward from the corner just beforehand. 50 mins: Fati tries a cross from the right but Ezequiel Garay is composed at the back post and chests the ball back to Cillessen. 47 mins: Great start from the visitors. They immediately romp up the right-hand side, an initial cross gets a suspicious looking block from Pique at the front post. The second comes to Gameiro but his effort is high and wide. Shades of handball as Pique cut out the first ball in. 46 mins: Valencia get us back underway. Ansu Fati the star of the show at the break. He has scored one, created the other for De Jong and generally carried the Bar\u00e7a threat. If not for the pesky Gameiro, Valencia would be buried. As it is, the visitors have been able to count on Gameiro and the Frenchman certainly has the hosts\u2019 back line running scared. 44 mins: Griezmann, overshadowed so far, tries to make his mark on the game with an ambitious effort from distance which is a little too ambitious and sails harmlessly over. 39 mins: Ansu Fati should have had a penalty! A delightful piece of skill from the youngster sees him flick a ball over a defender\u2019s head to spin away and create a chance, the members loved that. A couple of phases later he is brought down in the box as he skipped past a challenge. It looked soft initially but from the replay there was enough contact for a foul, he is after all little more than a child. 37 mins: Bar\u00e7a nearly gift Gameiro another allowing a hamrless counter attack to turn into a couple of genuine chances. Firstly Ter Stegen has to be smart to rush out and prevent the striker rounding him, then the keeper comes up big when the ball is recycled into the box and Gameiro attempts a bicycle kick. The Frenchman\u2019s pace looks capable of creating something when he\u2019s running at the Barcelona back line. 33 mins: Ansu Fati is again in the thick of it, firing at goal from distance. This one is a bit more wayward than his previous efforts but the 16-year-old is finding acres of space on the left hand side. Just before Camp Nou was screaming for a couple of penalties, neither should have been given. 30 mins: First card of the game goes to Rodrigo after he clips De Jong, harsh for a yellow that. Gameiro thinks he has scored! He\u2019s through on goal and fires past Ter Stegen but it is ruled out... wait we are going to VAR for an offside check. It looks good and after an inexplicably long wait it is given, game on! 23 mins: Perhaps Bar\u00e7a just need to keep scoring. They look most secure when popping it around the Valencia box, probing from side to side in search of an opening. It is slow but alluring, more like watching golf than football. A pretty passage ends with Arthur trying to dink a pretty pass into Griezmann but probably wanted a sand wedge rather than a nine iron. 19 mins: Here is the weakness of this Bar\u00e7a team. Valencia apply a modicum of pressure and suddenly it looks as if the house might collapse. Gameiro twice bursts away from the Barcelona defence, the first time he is forced to check back, resulting in a messy scramble to clear, then he gets in behind but cannot find the target with a left-footed shot. 16 mins: Ansu Fati is inches away from getting his second! The kid cuts from the right and flashes a curling shot between two defenders that leaves Cillessen standing and drifts just past the far post. 12 mins: How do Valencia come back from this? Albert Celades finds his side 2-0 down inside ten minutes in his first game in charge. They look shellshocked but perhaps some hope exists on the counter.

      "bodyText": "Gillian Marshall from Newtown in Wales is an epilepsy patient. She takes three different medications to manage her epilepsy \u2013 even changing the brand of one of these medications has seen Gillian admitted to hospital in the past. The Yellowhammer papers recently published reported that crashing out of the European Union will lead to medicine shortages, meaning Gillian may not have access to these vital medicines. Boris Johnson\u2019s hardline Brexit government is pursuing a policy that would put Gillian\u2019s health, and that of many others, at risk. It is pursuing a policy that will lead to food and fuel shortages, with the poorest in our country set to suffer the most from rising prices. And his utter disrespect for the Good Friday Agreement is threatening peace on the island of Ireland \u2013 not that he\u2019s bothered to meet any of the border communities. This government has no mandate for putting our country in such grave danger. The Conservative manifesto for the 2017 general election clearly said that every effort would be made to get a deal. All this pain and damage for what? So that Johnson gets to play at prime minister. Because that\u2019s what this is to him. A game. Because neither he nor any of the ministers around his cabinet table will be there when Gillian can\u2019t renew her prescription, or when redundancy notices are handed out and mortgage repayments missed. In his first four days in parliament, Johnson lost six votes, two senior ministers and 21 MPs. He likes to play the strongman, demeaning our police force by using them as a backdrop for his political games, but he is really making a habit of losing. Boris Johnson is running scared \u2013 being held to account by the people\u2019s representatives doesn\u2019t suit him, so he decided to shut down our democracy and threatened to disobey the rule of law. Boris Johnson is not fit to be prime minister. Nor is Jeremy Corbyn. This is a man who, faced with the biggest challenge our country has seen in generations, literally can\u2019t decide which side to take. Labour\u2019s position is now that they will negotiate a Brexit deal with the EU, put it to a referendum and then maybe campaign against it. It is less having your cake and eating it, and more having your cake and throwing it in the bin. Brexit has truly sent the Labour party into political meltdown. When asked in an interview last week whether she would rather go into coalition with the Liberal Democrats or the Brexit Party, Labour MP Emma Lewell-Buck said that she would put Nigel Farage into government. A man who stood in front of that famous Breaking Point poster and stokes hatred and division on a daily basis is now the preferred partner of government for a Labour MP, such is their commitment to delivering Brexit. It has been sad to watch the path Labour has taken. The party has betrayed the values it has stood for for decades.

Climate change does not create bushfires, but it can and does make them worse. A number of factors contribute to bushfire risk, including temperature, fuel load, dryness, wind speed and humidity.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the evidence on rising temperatures? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.bom.gov.au/state-of-the-climate/\">Bureau of Meteorology and the CSIRO</a>&nbsp;say Australia has warmed by 1C since 1910 and temperatures will increase in the future. The<a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/AR5_SYR_FINAL_SPM.pdf\">&nbsp;Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a>&nbsp;says it is extremely likely increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases since the mid-20th century is the main reason it is getting hotter. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bnhcrc.com.au/news/blogpost/richard-thornton/2019/grim-fire-season-looms-many-australians-remain-unprepared\">Bushfire and Natural Hazards research centre</a>&nbsp;says the variability of normal events sits on top of that. Warmer weather increases the number of days each year on which there is high or extreme bushfire risk.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What other effects do carbon emissions have?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Dry fuel load - the amount of forest and scrub available to burn - has been linked to rising emissions. Under the right conditions, carbon dioxide acts as a kind of fertiliser that increases plant growth.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>So is climate change making everything dryer? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Dryness is more complicated. Complex computer models have not found a consistent climate change signal linked to rising CO2 in the decline in rain that has produced the current eastern Australian drought. But higher temperatures accelerate evaporation. They also extend the growing season for vegetation in many regions, leading to greater transpiration (the process by which water is drawn from the soil and evaporated from plant leaves and flowers). The result is that soils, vegetation and the air may be drier than they would have been with the same amount of rainfall in the past.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What do recent weather patterns show?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The year coming into the 2019-20 summer has been unusually warm and dry for large parts of Australia. Above average temperatures now occur most years and 2019 has been the fifth driest start to the year on record, and the driest since 1970.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>I had a check of my skin because this week the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JasonClareMP/status/1169781893509726208\">Labor MP Jason Clare tweeted</a> an image of his bandaged leg after he had had a melanoma removed.</p> \n<p>It was one of those cases where whenever you hear of anyone who has had a melanoma removed it is used as the perfect time to remind everyone to go get checked, to wear sunscreen and to do all you can in effect not to get skin cancer.</p> \n<p>But when a bushfire or a cyclone or a drought occurs, there is conversely always the push to not politicise it, to not talk about climate change.

While I contemplated the anxiety of what that could mean I did not sit there wondering which day it was that I got sunburned which caused the corruption of a cell that has started to turn the mole abnormal. Was it from the time I spent summers working as a fruit-picker during university? Or those many afternoons down on the banks of the River Murray swimming with friends during high school? Was it the time I got absolutely burned to a crisp on an overcast day holidaying on the Gold Coast in my early 20s? We don\u2019t ask this because it is in essence unanswerable, but we also know that \u2013 as the advert says \u2013 every tan is doing you damage.

We don\u2019t stop to ask for a specific causal event to give us proof of the link between sunburn or a tan and skin cancer.

The summer ahead looks to be a horror one for bushfires, with the latest Bureau of Meteorology outlook suggesting most of the continent has a less than 30% chance of exceeding its average rainfall for October to December.

But on climate change we are like some old bloke who has spent his life in the sun saying sunburn never killed him, all the while ignoring the mole on his back growing larger and more discoloured every month. Most of our politicians \u2013 and certainly our government \u2013 are not even at the stage of adaptation, let alone ready to take actions that might prevent further damage. I had a check of my skin because this week the Labor MP Jason Clare tweeted an image of his bandaged leg after he had had a melanoma removed. It was one of those cases where whenever you hear of anyone who has had a melanoma removed it is used as the perfect time to remind everyone to go get checked, to wear sunscreen and to do all you can in effect not to get skin cancer. But when a bushfire or a cyclone or a drought occurs, there is conversely always the push to not politicise it, to not talk about climate change. I suspect this is because if we did so we might have to start wondering why we were not doing anything about it. So we had the bizarre situation this week of the minister for natural disasters, David Littleproud, telling Guardian Australia in writing that \u201cI don\u2019t know if climate change is manmade\u201d. He then went on Sky News and told the same thing to David Speers before in parliament on Thursday suggesting that it was all a mistake and he really does think climate change is manmade. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Littleproud is not one of the climate change looneys in the government, so it did smack a little bit of him seeking to placate the ignorant in his party before realising that it made him look ignorant before the entire nation. The ALP was not exactly covering itself in climate change sunscreen this week either. On Wednesday the Greens moved a motion which, after acknowledging the early fire season and the critical role of emergency services, called on the government to \u201curgently take action to address climate change and manage the risk and severity of bushfires, invest in community adaptation efforts to build resilience to climate change in moderate and high risk areas, and commit to action to progress a rapid and just transition to clean and renewable energy sources to reduce the harmful emissions driving climate change\u201d. In essence, to act and adapt. The ALP voted against the motion because, as senator Katy Gallagher stated, it sought \u201cto politicise the emergency in Queensland, where 72 fires are currently burning\u201d. The ALP senator Murray Watt echoed these thoughts on Twitter and he replied when I (and others) criticised him by referring to a speech he had made on the issue the day before. In that speech on the bushfires his one reference to climate change was this: \u201cIt is of concern that so many bushfires of this severity are occurring so early in the year, and this should prompt further thought by all in this place.\u201d Yeah. That\u2019ll do it. It is bizarre the Cancer Council hasn\u2019t gone with the campaign slogan of \u201cthe growing number of moles on your body should prompt further thought\u201d. We need to be as loud and active about combating climate change as we are about skin cancer. Stop seeking excuses not to act, stop demanding definitive proof for every single incident, and look at the overall trends.

      "bodyText": "More than 80% of the welfare recipients who had their income support suspended under the controversial ParentsNext program were not at fault, new figures show. After the Coalition expanded the national pre-employment scheme last year, about 75,000 people who get parenting payments \u2013 mostly single mothers \u2013 were for the first time required to attend meetings and undertake education, training, or parenting programs such as playgroup to keep their payments. But critics of the program have repeatedly warned that many parents are struggling to meet their mutual obligations, which had previously only been imposed upon on those considered to be jobseekers, such as people on Newstart. Now, figures released to the Greens senator Rachel Siewert this week reveal that although a large proportion of all ParentsNext participants had their payments suspended for failing to meet their mutual obligations, most were not at fault. Of the 33,620 parents who had their income support temporarily cut off last financial year, only 4,868 did not have a \u201cvalid excuse\u201d and were handed a \u201cdemerit point\u201d by their job agency, the figures show. It means 85% had their payments suspended despite having a valid reason. The initial suspension of payments is a mostly automated process a under new job seeker compliance regime introduced last year. The government argues that people who have their payments suspended do not necessarily miss a payment and that if they are delayed, recipients receive backpay. But Siewert said the compliance regime of welfare suspensions and penalties should not be applied to those on the ParentsNext program, who can have children as young as six months old. \u201cIt does depend on when the suspension applies, but \u2026 it\u2019s not as if people have savings,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so if you get a suspension, you don\u2019t have any money. That directly impacts on a parent with children. \u201cWhen you put on top of that the fact that a whole lot of [the suspensions] are because the provider has stuffed up, people \u2026 basically have nothing to fall back on. People talk about having to go to Food Bank and not knowing whether they\u2019re going to be able to feed their kids.\u201d In one case last year, a woman had her payments suspended because she was admitted to hospital while 33 weeks pregnant and could not report to Centrelink. Participants have complained about first learning they had been placed on the program when their payments were suspended, while one mother told Guardian Australia she had their income support temporarily cut for taking her children to kindergarten rather than story time at the library. Labor\u2019s employment spokesman, Brendan O\u2019Connor, said: \u201cThe government\u2019s implementation of the ParentsNext program is deeply flawed, with evidence it is causing parents and their children great distress.\u201d But the employment minister, Michaelia Cash, said the government\u2019s new welfare compliance that was introduced last year was \u201cless punitive\u201d. She said financial penalties \u2013 where a person\u2019s payments are docked or forfeited rather than just suspended and delayed \u2013 had reduced by 90% compared to the old rules, while attendance rates also increased. \u201cWe know this because in the year following the implementation of the new TCF there was an approximate 90% reduction in financial penalties compared to the old framework, and the attendance rate at appointments improved to 75% (from 71% in the last year of the old framework).\u201d \u201cWhere participants have a legitimate reason for not meeting their mutual obligation, they can inform their provider ahead of time and they will not experience any suspension at all.\u201d Meanwhile, O\u2019Connor also accused the government of selectively releasing data about welfare sanctions, while refusing to release the official quarterly data. \u201cLabor recently asked for the latest job seeker compliance data through a Freedom of Information request, and was denied access to any information, yet coincidently the latest data has ended up in media articles today,\u201d he said. O\u2019Connor was referencing a Newscorp story which said participants in the Jobactive program had their payments suspended 2.36 million times last financial year. The data was not released publicly. The government has failed to release the official welfare compliance statistics this year. Last month, the Daily Telegraph reported data showing that 78% of participants in the Jobactive employment program had their payments suspended. The story prompted a much-maligned \u201cdole bludger\u201d segment on Sunrise. Guardian Australia requested the data referenced by the minister as well as separate figures. It showed more than 120,000 welfare recipients who had their payments suspended were not at fault.",

I turned 58. I have a 40-year work history and a bachelor of science with a double major in physics and chemistry, plus a string of other qualifications. I even have a forklift licence, and used to run the quality testing lab at the factory where I worked for eight years before it closed in 2012.</p> <p>According to my Jobactive provider, none of it happened. All they see is my age.</p> <p>When I became unemployed it was unexpected, and despite my confidence I struggled. Everywhere I applied said I was too qualified and they\u2019d have to pay me too much. When I started going to these providers, my 20-something caseworker suggested I should simply delete my qualifications from my resume.</p> <p>And just like that, at the push of a button, my whole working life was erased.</p> <p>Afterwards they started shunting me into jobs for which I was unsuited. They made me take cleaning jobs, even though I had arthritis. Once a caseworker asked me whether I had any retail experience. In 40 years I had not worked a day in retail but she said she had found the job for me and moved the screen around so I could see it. It was a job in sales. Up the top it said in big, bold letters that applicants must have a minimum of five years\u2019 retail experience. She even bought me interview clothes that didn\u2019t fit.</p> <p>If I didn\u2019t go to the interview my payments would have been cut, so I went along anyway in my clothes that didn\u2019t fit to explain why I was applying for a job I was entirely unqualified for.</p> <p>I keep getting into trouble because I won\u2019t use their version of my resume. They say I\u2019m not allowed to and that I have to show proof of my qualifications. So I take in my university degree \u2013 I\u2019ve got it framed \u2013 I take the whole thing in there and say, \u201cLook, this is my university degree and my forklift licence,\u201d and they still don\u2019t put it on to the system.</p> <p>And then at the next appointment I\u2019ll have another new 20-year-old caseworker who I have to explain myself to once more because there\u2019s nothing on the system. When I finish she says she doesn\u2019t believe me and threatens to cut off my payments if I don\u2019t do what she says.</p> <p>That\u2019s it. You\u2019re treated like a child by a child in an infinite loop, constantly afraid they\u2019ll cut off your payments again and you\u2019ll fall behind on your bills.</p> <h2><strong>Anonymous, 49, Perth</strong></h2> <p>Once you\u2019re in the system you\u2019re completely at the mercy of any person who is incompetent or has a grudge. You cope with gallows humour. Dealing with the Jobactive provider reminds me of those old Asterix comics where the Gauls had to navigate their way around the Roman bureaucracy. They\u2019d go up to one window and be told, no, you have to go to Room 1. At Room 1, they\u2019d be told they actually had to go to Room 2.</p> <p>I\u2019ve been cut off Centrelink so many times I\u2019ve lost count. It\u2019s mostly because of the soaring incompetence of the people running the system. If they don\u2019t want to deal with you, or a person with an attitude decides you\u2019re a \u201cnon-compliant person\u201d, they send you to Centrelink out of spite.</p> <p>The last time I was cut off, I was sent to do a Work for the Dole activity at a place ironically called \u201cPeople Who Care\u201d. We were doing busywork. It was terribly run. Twice they lost my paperwork but instead of losing my shit I politely asked whether they might take a look in their desk drawer.</p> <p>So later you get a text \u2013 they send you this text message to say you have been cut off because you haven\u2019t attended your work appointment. But I had. It turned out they had two separate managers on each day who hadn\u2019t bothered to do the paperwork. Apparently everyone who was there on those two days got cut off.</p> <p>This is pretty normal. Other people I know will get cut off if they\u2019re five minutes late to call their Jobactive provider. I\u2019ve been cut off because I\u2019ve called at the right time and the phone has been busy so it goes to message bank. Five minutes later I\u2019ll get a text message saying \u201cYou\u2019ve been cut off because you haven\u2019t reported in.\u201d So you call them back and then you get admonished because you didn\u2019t call at the correct time. Or they say they were on the phone.</p> <p>So then I ask: \u201cIf you knew I was going to call, why were you on the phone?\u201d</p> <p>I don\u2019t blame them though. All the people working in these places are just poor assholes who are just stuck in the same system. The person sitting on the other side of the desk from me in these places, that person could be me. They could end up on the side of the desk that I\u2019m sitting on. And that\u2019s what they\u2019re scared of.</p> <h2><strong>Anonymous, 32, South Australia </strong></h2> <p>My strange experience with a Jobactive provider happened back in November 2015. It was a week of pure, concentrated weirdness.</p> <p>The provider found me a job with a charity. They handled everything. My case manager even took the picture for the photo ID.</p> <p>There was a man who handled what limited training there was by phone. The day after, I had a trial shift. I had to collect money door-to-door with no information about what the charity actually did, who ran it or what the money we were raising was for \u2013 only that it was for children in the Philippines.</p> <p>The leaflets they gave us to hand out were about cancer, copied and pasted from Wikipedia, even though the charity was supposedly about education. When I spoke to people I couldn\u2019t even answer basic questions. And people were still generous. A blind man gave me $20. It was absurd and awful.</p> <p>When I asked my point of contact questions, he grew frustrated and aggressive with me. He told me to look on the website but it was just pictures of kids with vague descriptions; no programs, no initiatives. It\u2019s been taken down since, but the mission statement was just a copy of the tax definition of a charity.</p> <p>I looked up as much as I could about the company. I found the names associated with it had run similar charities that had been exposed as frauds by the ABC. These names weren\u2019t on the website or any training materials. [This charity] didn\u2019t have anything a normal charity had.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t know what to do, so I reported this to the ACCC and even made a police report. When I told my caseworker, they tried to make me keep doing the job. They told me they\u2019d had their office look it up and that the charity was properly registered, but anyone can register for a business name. I read charities have a year before they\u2019re audited.</p> <p>When my questions about how the collected money was spent still weren\u2019t answered, the case manager called my point of contact. That\u2019s when they agreed that something wasn\u2019t right and that I didn\u2019t have to do it any more. They joked nervously about ending up on A Current Affair.</p> <p>A few weeks later I had another appointment and my case manager casually mentioned that another client was still collecting money for [the charity]. She knew they were shonky and still nothing had been done.</p> <h2><strong>Todd Taranto, 27, West Gippsland</strong></h2> <p>Everything, I should say, started out fine. I\u2019m on the disability support pension, so when I was placed with the Jobactive provider I found the people there lovely and I was actually hopeful I may get a job. But I live in West Gippsland and there isn\u2019t much work here. I had no bites or anything.</p> <p>So six months in the Jobactive people started enrolling me in these mini job classes. They include things like interview prep, the different qualifications needed for a job, and were basically pointless. They were there to make it look like we were doing something. I was there two or three times a week to keep me occupied. And I did that for six weeks.</p> <p>At that time the case managers I dealt with kept changing as the company restructured. I went through three of them and eventually ended up with a disability consultant who suggested I look at doing a Certificate V in business and retail. It was supposed to be six months of doing two hours a week online.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9f227ad8e5a49058da943ce60a8e7b8e326ad82f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f227ad8e5a49058da943ce60a8e7b8e326ad82f/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Todd Taranto speaks to The Guardian about his personal experience with Centrelink.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Todd Taranto speaks to The Guardian about his personal experience with Centrelink.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Hopkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I agreed because it was better than jumping through their other hoops. I already had a bachelor in communications and an advanced diploma in business studies, so I thought this might be another qualification to add to my CV. But after the first few units, I realised I had already held a higher level qualification in the same area, so I already knew everything. When I later went through a period of unwellness, they allowed me to take a week or two off and I spoke to the consultant off-the-cuff. That\u2019s when she said she wouldn\u2019t have recommended I do the course. They basically let me waste my time for about six months.</p> <p>Then, at the end of 2018, I had a letter from Centrelink saying that it was worse than that: I wasn\u2019t required to attend appointments with a Jobactive provider at all. I didn\u2019t believe it at first, but then someone from Centrelink rang me to explain I was officially considered a \u201cvolunteer\u201d. They said I could continue going to appointments and looking for work if I wanted to, but then I\u2019d have to sign a contract which would lock me in.</p> <p>I thought something was wrong or there had been a mistake. The next time I went into the provider and spoke to my consultant, I told her about the phone call. We laughed about it because we agreed Centrelink must have made a mistake. Of course I was supposed to be here. I\u2019d been going to appointments for nearly two years.</p> <p>About a minute or two, she stopped, looked something up on her computer and told me Centrelink actually had it right: I didn\u2019t need to be there at all. I\u2019d spent two years of my life jumping through hoops for no reason.</p> <h2><strong>Anonymous, 27, South Australia</strong></h2> <p>I recently went for a pre-interview phone call at a Jobactive provider where I had to explain I worked for five years managing Work for the Dole before quitting. A series of unrelated life events forced a mental health crisis and a hospitalisation. Now I\u2019m on Newstart to supplement my income while I start a business. It\u2019s hard and embarrassing, especially as I know just how powerless you are as a job seeker.</p> <p>The whole system is broken, on both ends. I have so many stories from when I managed the Work for the Dole program. One that really affected me involved a client who was sent to work at a golf club. While on the job, he fell off some scaffolding that wasn\u2019t set up correctly and landed on his face. He had to be hospitalised and the breakages caused him breathing difficulties and disfiguration. That was really horrible and I took that guilt home with me after realising there was no support for him.</p> <p>I think Work for the Dole is like slave labour. There was no food provided for those doing the activities and people had to bring their own lunch. The subsidy for getting to the activity was an extra $20.80 a fortnight. To my knowledge this hasn\u2019t changed since 1997. You\u2019re essentially getting a bunch of people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds doing work that is often quite degrading. Meanwhile they are working for free for organisations that are making money off them. When I worked there, each individual placement was worth $1,000, or $3,500 for \u201ctraining\u201d activities. That money gets paid by the government to the organisation.</p> <p>Looking back on it, my family says that working [as a Work for the Dole manager] in my early 20s made me jaded. There were too many times I had people crying on the phone, saying they didn\u2019t have money for food and I was forced by law to say, \u201cWell, you didn\u2019t meet your mutual obligation, we have to notify Centrelink.\u201d Even if you go in wanting to help people, the system doesn\u2019t let you. Over time, one of two things happen: you either harden your heart and become a robot, or you take your work home with you and have a breakdown.</p> <h2><strong>Anonymous, 29, Northern Territory</strong></h2> <p>Last year Centrelink put me on the ParentsNext program. Dealing with them has been really frustrating as I\u2019m not supposed to be on this program. I\u2019m a mother of two children and I was studying and working when they put me on it.</p> <p>At first I thought I would go in and report to them and that was it. The lady I was going through at the Jobactive provider made my appointments once every two months at the start. Then about two or three weeks ago, I had a new consultant who said I shouldn\u2019t be on that program at all. They said I was working too much. Someone at Centrelink though decided I didn\u2019t have a job, even though I\u2019ve been working at the same organisation for the past two years for pay. That\u2019s when Centrelink wanted to make me start looking for 10 jobs a week.</p> <p>After that, Centrelink started bringing me in for appointments with my Jobactive provider more often. During the middle of a work day, I would have to tell my boss, \u201cSorry, but I have to leave to go to these appointments.\u201d My boss was supportive and wrote me a letter to try to help, which I showed the Jobactive people, but it didn\u2019t change anything.</p> <p>When I spoke to someone from Centrelink about it over the phone, they said the rules meant I had to look for 10 jobs. When I told them I wouldn\u2019t, they said I had to. I said to them: \u201cYou don\u2019t own me. I don\u2019t care. I\u2019m my own person.\u201d</p> <p>The case manager I deal with at the Jobactive is good though and can see I shouldn\u2019t be there, so she\u2019s started calling me via the phone so I don\u2019t have to go in. I\u2019m trying to get off ParentsNext now but Centrelink won\u2019t let me leave. Last week I was told to provide 13 weeks of payslips to exit the ParentsNext program. More paperwork.</p> <p>It\u2019s like when I talk, they don\u2019t listen.</p> <p><em>The unnamed contributors to this story are known to the journalist and asked to remain anonymous</em></p> <p><em>Reporting in this series is supported by VivCourt through the Guardian Civic Journalism Trust</em></p>",

Since then the system has grown and evolved into a network of 1,700 providers across Australia, with companies competing for public money and the right to triage some 750,000 unemployed people on Newstart into a series of government schemes with questionable outcomes such as Work for the Dole, ParentsNext and the PaTh Program.

That\u2019s when they agreed that something wasn\u2019t right and that I didn\u2019t have to do it any more. They joked nervously about ending up on A Current Affair. A few weeks later I had another appointment and my case manager casually mentioned that another client was still collecting money for [the charity]. She knew they were shonky and still nothing had been done. Todd Taranto, 27, West Gippsland Everything, I should say, started out fine. I\u2019m on the disability support pension, so when I was placed with the Jobactive provider I found the people there lovely and I was actually hopeful I may get a job. But I live in West Gippsland and there isn\u2019t much work here. I had no bites or anything. So six months in the Jobactive people started enrolling me in these mini job classes. They include things like interview prep, the different qualifications needed for a job, and were basically pointless. They were there to make it look like we were doing something. I was there two or three times a week to keep me occupied. And I did that for six weeks. At that time the case managers I dealt with kept changing as the company restructured. I went through three of them and eventually ended up with a disability consultant who suggested I look at doing a Certificate V in business and retail. It was supposed to be six months of doing two hours a week online. I agreed because it was better than jumping through their other hoops. I already had a bachelor in communications and an advanced diploma in business studies, so I thought this might be another qualification to add to my CV. But after the first few units, I realised I had already held a higher level qualification in the same area, so I already knew everything. When I later went through a period of unwellness, they allowed me to take a week or two off and I spoke to the consultant off-the-cuff. That\u2019s when she said she wouldn\u2019t have recommended I do the course. They basically let me waste my time for about six months. Then, at the end of 2018, I had a letter from Centrelink saying that it was worse than that: I wasn\u2019t required to attend appointments with a Jobactive provider at all. I didn\u2019t believe it at first, but then someone from Centrelink rang me to explain I was officially considered a \u201cvolunteer\u201d. They said I could continue going to appointments and looking for work if I wanted to, but then I\u2019d have to sign a contract which would lock me in. I thought something was wrong or there had been a mistake. The next time I went into the provider and spoke to my consultant, I told her about the phone call. We laughed about it because we agreed Centrelink must have made a mistake. Of course I was supposed to be here. I\u2019d been going to appointments for nearly two years. About a minute or two, she stopped, looked something up on her computer and told me Centrelink actually had it right: I didn\u2019t need to be there at all. I\u2019d spent two years of my life jumping through hoops for no reason. Anonymous, 27, South Australia I recently went for a pre-interview phone call at a Jobactive provider where I had to explain I worked for five years managing Work for the Dole before quitting. A series of unrelated life events forced a mental health crisis and a hospitalisation. Now I\u2019m on Newstart to supplement my income while I start a business. It\u2019s hard and embarrassing, especially as I know just how powerless you are as a job seeker. The whole system is broken, on both ends. I have so many stories from when I managed the Work for the Dole program. One that really affected me involved a client who was sent to work at a golf club. While on the job, he fell off some scaffolding that wasn\u2019t set up correctly and landed on his face. He had to be hospitalised and the breakages caused him breathing difficulties and disfiguration. That was really horrible and I took that guilt home with me after realising there was no support for him. I think Work for the Dole is like slave labour. There was no food provided for those doing the activities and people had to bring their own lunch. The subsidy for getting to the activity was an extra $20.80 a fortnight. To my knowledge this hasn\u2019t changed since 1997. You\u2019re essentially getting a bunch of people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds doing work that is often quite degrading. Meanwhile they are working for free for organisations that are making money off them. When I worked there, each individual placement was worth $1,000, or $3,500 for \u201ctraining\u201d activities. That money gets paid by the government to the organisation. Looking back on it, my family says that working [as a Work for the Dole manager] in my early 20s made me jaded. There were too many times I had people crying on the phone, saying they didn\u2019t have money for food and I was forced by law to say, \u201cWell, you didn\u2019t meet your mutual obligation, we have to notify Centrelink.\u201d Even if you go in wanting to help people, the system doesn\u2019t let you. Over time, one of two things happen: you either harden your heart and become a robot, or you take your work home with you and have a breakdown. Anonymous, 29, Northern Territory Last year Centrelink put me on the ParentsNext program. Dealing with them has been really frustrating as I\u2019m not supposed to be on this program. I\u2019m a mother of two children and I was studying and working when they put me on it. At first I thought I would go in and report to them and that was it. The lady I was going through at the Jobactive provider made my appointments once every two months at the start. Then about two or three weeks ago, I had a new consultant who said I shouldn\u2019t be on that program at all. They said I was working too much. Someone at Centrelink though decided I didn\u2019t have a job, even though I\u2019ve been working at the same organisation for the past two years for pay. That\u2019s when Centrelink wanted to make me start looking for 10 jobs a week. After that, Centrelink started bringing me in for appointments with my Jobactive provider more often. During the middle of a work day, I would have to tell my boss, \u201cSorry, but I have to leave to go to these appointments.\u201d My boss was supportive and wrote me a letter to try to help, which I showed the Jobactive people, but it didn\u2019t change anything. When I spoke to someone from Centrelink about it over the phone, they said the rules meant I had to look for 10 jobs. When I told them I wouldn\u2019t, they said I had to. I said to them: \u201cYou don\u2019t own me. I don\u2019t care. I\u2019m my own person.\u201d The case manager I deal with at the Jobactive is good though and can see I shouldn\u2019t be there, so she\u2019s started calling me via the phone so I don\u2019t have to go in. I\u2019m trying to get off ParentsNext now but Centrelink won\u2019t let me leave. Last week I was told to provide 13 weeks of payslips to exit the ParentsNext program. More paperwork. It\u2019s like when I talk, they don\u2019t listen.

It\u2019s been in the works for 30 years and cost $1.6bn. McCarthy, Copland and a good chunk of Toowoomba lobbied for years that the new road be called the Multuggerah Way. Their hopes were high. Down in the valley the Darren Lockyer Way celebrated a guy who knew how to play football but had nothing to do with the place. The plan didn\u2019t quite come off. After much consideration, Multuggerah was given a viaduct \u2013 a spectacular piece of engineering \u2013 but as leaked to the local paper a few days before the ribbon was cut, the official name of the Toowoomba bypass would be The Toowoomba Bypass. Still, it\u2019s something: a stretch of road designed to save the town from a few thousand trucks a day honours the memory of a warrior who set out to stop the traffic once and for all under One Tree Hill.",

It results in a sudden and significant depression and lifts just as abruptly when the woman\u2019s period begins.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a condition where there are significant depression symptoms, and that can include suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts, some of which are, tragically, realised,\u201d says Kulkarni, who has been working in and researching the area of women\u2019s mental health for almost 30 years.</p> <p>\u201cSome of the key features of PMDD are when a woman says, \u2018It\u2019s like someone flicked a switch. I\u2019m OK, then suddenly, bang, there is a major depression. I can\u2019t get out of bed, I can\u2019t think.

In 2013 it was included as a depressive disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mood Disorders, published by the American Psychiatric Association.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There are some women who are more sensitive to their hormone fluctuations than others</p> <footer> <cite>Prof Jayashri Kulkarni</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Significantly, a gene related to PMDD was found by researchers from the US National Institutes of Health and published in the journal Molecular Psychiatry in 2017. It points to a biological predisposition for those women who are extra sensitive to the normal hormonal fluctuations in their cycles. At the time the gene discovery was published, an NIH researcher, Dr David Goldman, said: \u201cThis is a big moment for women\u2019s health because it establishes that women with PMDD have an intrinsic difference in their molecular apparatus for response to sex hormones \u2013 not just emotional behaviours they should be able to voluntarily control.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a pivotal time for women\u2019s wellbeing in Australia.

And there are some women who are more sensitive to their hormone fluctuations than others.\u201d</p> <p>Rachel is one of those women. Her experience can be traced back to adolescence, but she was officially diagnosed only six years ago, in her early 30s, after years searching for an answer. A red flag for Rachel, as well as her depressive symptoms, was when her inner dialogue would suddenly nosedive into negative self-talk. \u201cThere would suddenly be a shift \u2026 an almost bullying way of talking to myself that wasn\u2019t characteristic of me,\u201d she says.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279045/table/premenstrual-syndrom.table1diag/\">A PMDD diagnosis</a> requires women to experience at least five symptoms in the final week before her period, which improve when menstruation starts and are minimal or absent in the remaining weeks of her cycle. These include mood swings, irritability, anger, anxiety, tension, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, social withdrawal and \u2013 as Rachel experienced \u2013 self-deprecating thoughts. There can be physical symptoms too, such as breast tenderness or swelling, joint or muscle pain, and a sensation of \u201cbloating\u201d or weight gain. Often women are asked to keep a diary to note the symptoms for several cycles before a diagnosis is reached.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/28/stigma-periods-boys-young-women-bullying-menstruation\">The stigma over periods won\u2019t end until boys learn about them too | Amika George</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Treatment can vary from practitioner to practitioner and from patient to patient \u2013 the same approach does not necessarily work for everyone. Kulkarni works closely with an endocrinologist and favours a multipronged approach involving hormone modulation \u2013 experimenting with doses of progesterone and oestrogen (including the contraceptive pill and oestrogen patches) \u2013 underpinned by psychological support. Low doses of antidepressant medication are added if needed but are not the first line of treatment. In the worst-case scenario, when women are not responding to any other treatments, inducing menopause with medication is an option.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The thing is, women\u2019s mental health is not a national priority \u2013 and it should be</p> <footer> <cite>Prof Jayashri Kulkarni</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe have in the past had to resort to chemical menopause, at the very severe end, where somebody is profoundly depressed and their life is at risk,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s an extreme approach and very few people need it. It\u2019s essentially shutting off those hormonal fluctuations. And we\u2019ve had some great successes in women who have tried everything else and nothing has worked.\u201d</p> <p>Kulkarni says hysterectomies are not advocated by the clinic unless there is a very clear physical health reason beyond PMDD, such as additional complications with fibroids or severe endometriosis. </p> <p>For Rachel the combination of psychological support, hormonal and anti-depressant treatment has allowed her to manage her condition, although it has taken time.</p> <p>\u201cThe big thing I have noticed in the past six months in particular is that the fog has lifted,\u201d she says. \u201cThere isn\u2019t this cognitive fog, this sense of walking through treacle, which was the fatigue I had a lot of the time.\u201d</p> <p>She says she found it hard to confide in anyone about her condition, including female friends. In the past she would reach out if she was struggling but with PMDD, she feels there is still a stigma and a lack of language around how to talk to others about a women\u2019s health condition.</p> <p>\u201cEven between other women, just saying, \u2018My hormones at the moment mean that I don\u2019t feel like myself.\u2019 How do we talk about that?</p> <p>\u201cThe thing that has really hit me with all this, is that mood isn\u2019t just depression and anxiety. It sits so much within your hormones and broader health. That our experience of those things, as women, are so interrelated with our hormones \u2013 and we just don\u2019t talk about it. It\u2019s because it\u2019s women\u2019s health.\u201d</p> <p>Kulkarni agrees and says awareness needs to be raised nationally around women\u2019s mental health: \u201cThe thing is, women\u2019s mental health is not a national priority \u2013 and it should be.\u201d</p> <p>* Name has been changed</p> <ul> <li><p><em>In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14.

And this happened again and again and again.\u201d She says these symptoms \u2013 which doctors have now attributed to premenstrual dysphoric disorder, or PMDD \u2013 have affected intimate relationships and friendships over the years because she would withdraw socially if she felt the fog of depression closing in: \u201cI couldn\u2019t stand myself so how could anyone else?\u201d PMDD affects between 3% and 8% of women of reproductive age. It\u2019s caused by fluctuations in hormone levels which affect brain chemistry and result in severe mood disturbances, says Prof Jayashri Kulkarni, a psychiatrist and director of the Monash Alfred psychiatry research centre at Monash University in Melbourne. Unlike PMS, which hits two to four days out from menstruation with various physical and emotional symptoms, the onset of PMDD is one to two weeks before a woman gets her period, known as the luteal phase. It results in a sudden and significant depression and lifts just as abruptly when the woman\u2019s period begins. \u201cThis is a condition where there are significant depression symptoms, and that can include suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts, some of which are, tragically, realised,\u201d says Kulkarni, who has been working in and researching the area of women\u2019s mental health for almost 30 years. \u201cSome of the key features of PMDD are when a woman says, \u2018It\u2019s like someone flicked a switch. I\u2019m OK, then suddenly, bang, there is a major depression. I can\u2019t get out of bed, I can\u2019t think. I get tearful, I get irritable, I get angry, I can\u2019t process cognitively very well.\u2019 \u201d Kulkarni says PMDD symptoms, including anxiety, rage and hostility \u2013 all symptoms of depression although often not recognised as such \u2013 can wreak havoc on relationships. \u201cAll sorts of things can go astray, including work performances and relationships with colleagues,\u201d she says. Kulkarni has seen adolescents as young as 12 affected, all the way through to women nearing menopause, when the condition typically worsens. Although women have been battling this condition for generations, PMDD has been recognised as a clinical mental health condition for only six years. In 2013 it was included as a depressive disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mood Disorders, published by the American Psychiatric Association. Significantly, a gene related to PMDD was found by researchers from the US National Institutes of Health and published in the journal Molecular Psychiatry in 2017. It points to a biological predisposition for those women who are extra sensitive to the normal hormonal fluctuations in their cycles. At the time the gene discovery was published, an NIH researcher, Dr David Goldman, said: \u201cThis is a big moment for women\u2019s health because it establishes that women with PMDD have an intrinsic difference in their molecular apparatus for response to sex hormones \u2013 not just emotional behaviours they should be able to voluntarily control.\u201d It\u2019s a pivotal time for women\u2019s wellbeing in Australia. It\u2019s a time when women\u2019s health issues, like endometriosis, are finally being talked about and taken seriously \u2013 evidenced by the $10m federal government funding boost for endometriosis research and awareness announced earlier this year by the health minister, Greg Hunt. Kulkarni is at pains to emphasise that PMDD is not just \u201cbelow the belt\u201d but a condition with its epicentre in the brain. She says all the hormones involved in a woman\u2019s cycle \u2013 progesterone, oestrogen and testosterone \u2013 are potent brain chemicals. \u201cProgesterone, and in particular allopregnanolone (a hormone produced when progesterone is broken down in the brain), is thought to be a major cause of PMDD,\u201d she says. \u201cBut oestrogen \u2018protects\u2019 the brain in many ways, and imbalances in progesterone and oestrogen in the brain can lead to the depression symptoms seen in women with PMDD. \u201cThese are all very potent hormones. And there are some women who are more sensitive to their hormone fluctuations than others.\u201d Rachel is one of those women. Her experience can be traced back to adolescence, but she was officially diagnosed only six years ago, in her early 30s, after years searching for an answer. A red flag for Rachel, as well as her depressive symptoms, was when her inner dialogue would suddenly nosedive into negative self-talk. \u201cThere would suddenly be a shift \u2026 an almost bullying way of talking to myself that wasn\u2019t characteristic of me,\u201d she says. A PMDD diagnosis requires women to experience at least five symptoms in the final week before her period, which improve when menstruation starts and are minimal or absent in the remaining weeks of her cycle. These include mood swings, irritability, anger, anxiety, tension, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, social withdrawal and \u2013 as Rachel experienced \u2013 self-deprecating thoughts. There can be physical symptoms too, such as breast tenderness or swelling, joint or muscle pain, and a sensation of \u201cbloating\u201d or weight gain. Often women are asked to keep a diary to note the symptoms for several cycles before a diagnosis is reached. Treatment can vary from practitioner to practitioner and from patient to patient \u2013 the same approach does not necessarily work for everyone. Kulkarni works closely with an endocrinologist and favours a multipronged approach involving hormone modulation \u2013 experimenting with doses of progesterone and oestrogen (including the contraceptive pill and oestrogen patches) \u2013 underpinned by psychological support. Low doses of antidepressant medication are added if needed but are not the first line of treatment. In the worst-case scenario, when women are not responding to any other treatments, inducing menopause with medication is an option. \u201cWe have in the past had to resort to chemical menopause, at the very severe end, where somebody is profoundly depressed and their life is at risk,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s an extreme approach and very few people need it. It\u2019s essentially shutting off those hormonal fluctuations. And we\u2019ve had some great successes in women who have tried everything else and nothing has worked.\u201d Kulkarni says hysterectomies are not advocated by the clinic unless there is a very clear physical health reason beyond PMDD, such as additional complications with fibroids or severe endometriosis. For Rachel the combination of psychological support, hormonal and anti-depressant treatment has allowed her to manage her condition, although it has taken time. \u201cThe big thing I have noticed in the past six months in particular is that the fog has lifted,\u201d she says. \u201cThere isn\u2019t this cognitive fog, this sense of walking through treacle, which was the fatigue I had a lot of the time.\u201d She says she found it hard to confide in anyone about her condition, including female friends. In the past she would reach out if she was struggling but with PMDD, she feels there is still a stigma and a lack of language around how to talk to others about a women\u2019s health condition. \u201cEven between other women, just saying, \u2018My hormones at the moment mean that I don\u2019t feel like myself.\u2019 How do we talk about that? \u201cThe thing that has really hit me with all this, is that mood isn\u2019t just depression and anxiety. It sits so much within your hormones and broader health. That our experience of those things, as women, are so interrelated with our hormones \u2013 and we just don\u2019t talk about it. It\u2019s because it\u2019s women\u2019s health.\u201d Kulkarni agrees and says awareness needs to be raised nationally around women\u2019s mental health: \u201cThe thing is, women\u2019s mental health is not a national priority \u2013 and it should be.\u201d * Name has been changed In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14.

      "body": "<p>Ed Smith doesn\u2019t look as if he goes around punching the air much, at least not in public. But then England\u2019s national selector doesn\u2019t really resemble an England selector either, traditionally the home of the florid, blazered eminence. Smith tends to look as if he\u2019s stopped off briefly on a motoring tour of 1930s Tuscany or, like James Joyce, has unaccountably been offered a job as senior vice-president at Morgan Stanley.</p> <p>New things, new people, new methods. Smith has also been the object of some ambient chuntering during these last few weeks of Ashes cricket. This is a chief selector whose picks have been bold at times, hard to decipher at others, and which will be marked now by a series during which England have failed to regain the Ashes urn.</p> <p>With this in mind Smith might have been forgiven a punch of the air, or at least a studied flush of pleasure, as Joe Denly walked off at tea on a sunlit afternoon at the Oval having batted through two sessions, and with a first Test hundred in his sights.</p> <p>Of all the new picks during the last 18 months Denly has perhaps been the most thoroughly Smith-flavoured, albeit not for the reasons some have assumed. One former Kent player laughed out loud at the idea Smith might pick his former teammate out of ties of matey loyalty. The response, in essence: if you think that, you obviously don\u2019t know Ed Smith very well \u2013 with the suggestion good old Joe from Canterbury is unlikely to figure too prominently in Smith\u2019s list of vital VIP personages to please at all costs.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/14/ashes-england-australia-fifth-test-day-three-match-report\">Joe Denly misses out on century but steers England to dominant position</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Instead the inclusion of Denly, and the continued inclusion of Denly, is a function of Smith\u2019s methods, his theory on transferable skills; and perhaps also, as some maintain, the simple desire to be proved right.</p> <p>It is exactly a year since Denly, 30-something veteran of the Dhaka Dynamites, Karachi Kings and the Barisal Burners, was recalled for England\u2019s Test tour of Sri Lanka. It was a funky-looking pick at the time, based on Denly\u2019s success in T20 cricket, some excitable talk about his leg-break bowling and above all because Smith had detected a shadow of genuine class in his cricket, yet to reach its full expression.</p> <p>His presence since has felt like a point of principle being put to the test. The recall of Jos Buttler, a debut for Sam Curran, the promotion of Rory Burns: these have all been logical, even quite conventional selection calls for the Smith regime. Judge me, instead, by my Denlys.</p> <p>It has been a grind. From North Sound to Manchester Denly has been biddable, brave, adaptable and short of runs. Something began to shift at Headingley. He has been lucky with drops and play-and-misses. But Denly has also begun to look more poised and even rather classy here in his final knock of the Ashes summer.</p> <p>Four not out overnight, Denly was imperious against Nathan Lyon in the mid-morning sunlight. He skipped out and lofted him into the pavilion with a beautifully high front elbow. Later he came down again and carved a chest-high skimmer past mid-off\u2019s right hand.</p> <p>There was another working-over from Pat Cummins, who hit Denly in the box, then bounced him repeatedly. This has been an area of discomfort. But Denly has adapted. Here he simply ducked. There were some dreamy drives through the covers and a sense above all of a man finding his rhythm.</p> <p>Last September Denly had looked like a moneyball-style pick, an informed hunch at best. The case against Smith, from those who like to have a case against people, has been that this kind of racy, deconstructivist thinking will be found out by older truths. Or more simply that it will create a clique of entitled star players, the white-ball fancy boys, beneficiaries of all this fresh attacking thinking.</p> <p>The facts are different. Dom Bess was also in that first squad, an injury-forced selection. Since then England have given debuts to Sam Curran, Ollie Pope, Rory Burns, Ben Foakes, Denly, Jason Roy, Olly Stone, and Jofra Archer. Of these only Roy as an opener has been a howler. And post-World Cup most of us were ready to buy into that one.</p> <p>At the Oval Denly chugged through the afternoon session. His third fifty in his last four innings came up with a scorching clip through midwicket. An inside edge to square-leg moved him to 70 and a new top score. It took a fine delivery from Peter Siddle to catch the edge and cut him off six short of a first Test hundred.</p> <p>Denly has done enough to earn a winter tour, perhaps even the most unexpected of central contract awards in Friday\u2019s roll-out. It would be reward for a hunch, for continuing to graft \u2013 and above all for that niche but increasingly visible touch of class.</p>",

Smith tends to look as if he\u2019s stopped off briefly on a motoring tour of 1930s Tuscany or, like James Joyce, has unaccountably been offered a job as senior vice-president at Morgan Stanley. New things, new people, new methods. Smith has also been the object of some ambient chuntering during these last few weeks of Ashes cricket. This is a chief selector whose picks have been bold at times, hard to decipher at others, and which will be marked now by a series during which England have failed to regain the Ashes urn. With this in mind Smith might have been forgiven a punch of the air, or at least a studied flush of pleasure, as Joe Denly walked off at tea on a sunlit afternoon at the Oval having batted through two sessions, and with a first Test hundred in his sights. Of all the new picks during the last 18 months Denly has perhaps been the most thoroughly Smith-flavoured, albeit not for the reasons some have assumed. One former Kent player laughed out loud at the idea Smith might pick his former teammate out of ties of matey loyalty. The response, in essence: if you think that, you obviously don\u2019t know Ed Smith very well \u2013 with the suggestion good old Joe from Canterbury is unlikely to figure too prominently in Smith\u2019s list of vital VIP personages to please at all costs. Instead the inclusion of Denly, and the continued inclusion of Denly, is a function of Smith\u2019s methods, his theory on transferable skills; and perhaps also, as some maintain, the simple desire to be proved right. It is exactly a year since Denly, 30-something veteran of the Dhaka Dynamites, Karachi Kings and the Barisal Burners, was recalled for England\u2019s Test tour of Sri Lanka. It was a funky-looking pick at the time, based on Denly\u2019s success in T20 cricket, some excitable talk about his leg-break bowling and above all because Smith had detected a shadow of genuine class in his cricket, yet to reach its full expression. His presence since has felt like a point of principle being put to the test. The recall of Jos Buttler, a debut for Sam Curran, the promotion of Rory Burns: these have all been logical, even quite conventional selection calls for the Smith regime. Judge me, instead, by my Denlys. It has been a grind. From North Sound to Manchester Denly has been biddable, brave, adaptable and short of runs. Something began to shift at Headingley. He has been lucky with drops and play-and-misses. But Denly has also begun to look more poised and even rather classy here in his final knock of the Ashes summer. Four not out overnight, Denly was imperious against Nathan Lyon in the mid-morning sunlight. He skipped out and lofted him into the pavilion with a beautifully high front elbow. Later he came down again and carved a chest-high skimmer past mid-off\u2019s right hand. There was another working-over from Pat Cummins, who hit Denly in the box, then bounced him repeatedly. This has been an area of discomfort. But Denly has adapted. Here he simply ducked. There were some dreamy drives through the covers and a sense above all of a man finding his rhythm. Last September Denly had looked like a moneyball-style pick, an informed hunch at best. The case against Smith, from those who like to have a case against people, has been that this kind of racy, deconstructivist thinking will be found out by older truths. Or more simply that it will create a clique of entitled star players, the white-ball fancy boys, beneficiaries of all this fresh attacking thinking. The facts are different. Dom Bess was also in that first squad, an injury-forced selection. Since then England have given debuts to Sam Curran, Ollie Pope, Rory Burns, Ben Foakes, Denly, Jason Roy, Olly Stone, and Jofra Archer. Of these only Roy as an opener has been a howler. And post-World Cup most of us were ready to buy into that one. At the Oval Denly chugged through the afternoon session. His third fifty in his last four innings came up with a scorching clip through midwicket. An inside edge to square-leg moved him to 70 and a new top score. It took a fine delivery from Peter Siddle to catch the edge and cut him off six short of a first Test hundred. Denly has done enough to earn a winter tour, perhaps even the most unexpected of central contract awards in Friday\u2019s roll-out. It would be reward for a hunch, for continuing to graft \u2013 and above all for that niche but increasingly visible touch of class.",

The Champions League returns on Tuesday, unleashing an excited flurry of anticipatory questions: Can Liverpool defend their crown? Will Pep Guardiola stop overcomplicating things and, after a nine-year break, finally lift his third European title as a manager? Will Juventus\u2019s gamble on Cristiano Ronaldo pay off? Are Barcelona and Real Madrid as shambolic as they appear? Who will Paris Saint\u2011Germain lose to hilariously this time? But mostly, when does the real stuff start?</p> <p>Does any other competition that so regularly ends so brilliantly go through such a protracted clearing of the throat? Last season only one side managed to eliminate a club with a higher annual revenue in the group stage. The year before there were four sides eliminated by teams with lower annual revenues and before that just one again. Of the last 48 teams to reach the knockout stages, only six did not follow a remorseless financial logic \u2013 and even then it is hard to claim that Ajax or Basel putting out Benfica, or Roma qualifying ahead of Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, really counts as especially noteworthy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/30/uefa-agrees-deal-clubs-cap-prices-away-fans-europe-champions-league\">Uefa agrees deal with clubs to cap prices for away fans in European competition</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Look at the bookmakers\u2019 odds. Groups A, B, D and E are regarded as foregone conclusions, with even the second favourites to qualify 9-2 on or shorter. Only Group F appears as a genuine four-way battle, with Zenit, seeded in the highest pot by dint of winning the Russian championship, fourth favourites to go through at 6-4. That in effect means that in the other seven groups, there will be 84 matches to decide whether Atalanta\u2019s high press can oust a Shakhtar in transition after the departure of Paulo Fonseca, whether Antonio Conte can bring enough focus to Internazionale to challenge Borussia Dortmund and whether Valencia can overcome the chaos prompted by the dismissal of their manager, Marcelino, this past week to edge out Ajax.</p> <p>Or to put that another way, in six of the eight groups one side is rated 50-1 or longer to come top. The Czech champions, Slavia Prague \u2013 drawn with Barcelona, Dortmund and Inter \u2013 are 100-1, which is to say the same starting price as Foinavon, the most outlandish Grand National winner in history.</p> <p>This is the curse of the competition: it is not just that there is a small cabal of super-clubs far stronger than the rest; it is that there is also a small group of outsiders whose only chance is whatever the football equivalent of a pile-up at the 23rd fence would be.

Champions League group games provide content. Delight as Cristiano Ronaldo scores a hat-trick! Marvel as Neymar nutmegs a full\u2011back! Gasp as Lionel Messi skips by four defenders! Brief YouTube clips rarely convey that the opponent being outwitted is a Belarusian journeyman being paid 100 times less a week than the star.</p> <p>But the remorseless logic of football\u2019s neoliberal economics has taken effect. The Champions League has made the rich richer to the point that domestic titles have become almost worthless. It is why Juventus took their gamble on Ronaldo last summer, paying \u20ac100m for a 33-year-old in order, as they saw it, to provide the attacking thrust that would transform appearances in two of the previous four finals into a first Champions League success since 1996. When the subsequent European campaign ended with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/apr/16/juventus-ajax-champions-league-match-report\" title=\"\">quarter-final defeat </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/apr/16/juventus-ajax-champions-league-match-report\" title=\"\">by Ajax</a>, the manager, Max Allegri, despite five Serie A titles in a row, was replaced.</p> <p>There is an epic quality to this, taking in the classic themes of greed and ambition, now set against the ticking clock of Ronaldo\u2019s continued fitness as an elite athlete. It is undeniably great content. But in terms of football it unfortunately produces between two and seven intriguing games per super\u2011club, beginning next February.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/29/champions-league-group-guide-liverpool-spurs-manchester-city-chelsea\">Champions League group-by-group guide: predictions and star players</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Little wonder, then, that Europe\u2019s non-Premier League elite are so desperate to alter the format of the Champions League. It manifestly needs changing. A group stage in which roughly 80% of the games are largely meaningless while amplifying and reifying pre-existing financial inequalities cannot stand.</p> <p>But the plan proposed by the Juventus chairman, Andrea Agnelli, for four groups of eight somehow managed to make worse the structural inequality while comprising a raft of games that earlier results could have rendered entirely meaningless (as opposed to the present structure, in which a lot of theoretically meaningful games are rendered meaningless because one side is so much stronger than the other).</p> <p>That proposal appears to have been headed off by Premier League clubs \u2013 not, of course, for the good of the game, but because it threatened the financial advantages they have from being in the Premier League. The great irony is that, beyond the supreme marketing, the reason for the Premier League\u2019s popularity, for all its imbalances, is that it remains far less predictable than any other major league. There may be a lesson there.</p>",

      "bodyText": "I n the distance the anthem swells. Inappropriate advertising hoardings are covered up. A continent prepares to give thanks to Gazprom for providing them with football. The Champions League returns on Tuesday, unleashing an excited flurry of anticipatory questions: Can Liverpool defend their crown? Will Pep Guardiola stop overcomplicating things and, after a nine-year break, finally lift his third European title as a manager? Will Juventus\u2019s gamble on Cristiano Ronaldo pay off? Are Barcelona and Real Madrid as shambolic as they appear? Who will Paris Saint\u2011Germain lose to hilariously this time? But mostly, when does the real stuff start? Does any other competition that so regularly ends so brilliantly go through such a protracted clearing of the throat? Last season only one side managed to eliminate a club with a higher annual revenue in the group stage. The year before there were four sides eliminated by teams with lower annual revenues and before that just one again. Of the last 48 teams to reach the knockout stages, only six did not follow a remorseless financial logic \u2013 and even then it is hard to claim that Ajax or Basel putting out Benfica, or Roma qualifying ahead of Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, really counts as especially noteworthy. Look at the bookmakers\u2019 odds. Groups A, B, D and E are regarded as foregone conclusions, with even the second favourites to qualify 9-2 on or shorter. Only Group F appears as a genuine four-way battle, with Zenit, seeded in the highest pot by dint of winning the Russian championship, fourth favourites to go through at 6-4. That in effect means that in the other seven groups, there will be 84 matches to decide whether Atalanta\u2019s high press can oust a Shakhtar in transition after the departure of Paulo Fonseca, whether Antonio Conte can bring enough focus to Internazionale to challenge Borussia Dortmund and whether Valencia can overcome the chaos prompted by the dismissal of their manager, Marcelino, this past week to edge out Ajax. Or to put that another way, in six of the eight groups one side is rated 50-1 or longer to come top. The Czech champions, Slavia Prague \u2013 drawn with Barcelona, Dortmund and Inter \u2013 are 100-1, which is to say the same starting price as Foinavon, the most outlandish Grand National winner in history. This is the curse of the competition: it is not just that there is a small cabal of super-clubs far stronger than the rest; it is that there is also a small group of outsiders whose only chance is whatever the football equivalent of a pile-up at the 23rd fence would be. Dinamo Zagreb, for instance, have won the Croatian league in 13 of the last 14 seasons; in that time they have totalled four points in Champions League group games. Lose the game, take the money, go home, win the league, repeat, trapped on a mezzanine of futility. Perhaps Dinamo and other sides like them are happy enough with the format. They make a lot of money without a lot of effort and that sustains their hegemony at home, while they also have a glitzy shop window in which to advertise any promising young talent they may be able to sell for profit. But as a report commissioned this summer by Uefa into the polarisation of European football showed, attendances outside the big five leagues are falling, with the attention increasingly drawn to the elite. For a time the biggest clubs seemed to be satisfied as well. Football, the game itself, the thing played on the pitch, it must always be remembered, tends to be a minor consideration. Real Madrid\u2019s director general, Jos\u00e9 \u00c1ngel S\u00e1nchez, has said the club must see itself like Disney, as a content producer. Champions League group games provide content. Delight as Cristiano Ronaldo scores a hat-trick! Marvel as Neymar nutmegs a full\u2011back! Gasp as Lionel Messi skips by four defenders! Brief YouTube clips rarely convey that the opponent being outwitted is a Belarusian journeyman being paid 100 times less a week than the star. But the remorseless logic of football\u2019s neoliberal economics has taken effect. The Champions League has made the rich richer to the point that domestic titles have become almost worthless. It is why Juventus took their gamble on Ronaldo last summer, paying \u20ac100m for a 33-year-old in order, as they saw it, to provide the attacking thrust that would transform appearances in two of the previous four finals into a first Champions League success since 1996. When the subsequent European campaign ended with a quarter-final defeat by Ajax, the manager, Max Allegri, despite five Serie A titles in a row, was replaced. There is an epic quality to this, taking in the classic themes of greed and ambition, now set against the ticking clock of Ronaldo\u2019s continued fitness as an elite athlete. It is undeniably great content. But in terms of football it unfortunately produces between two and seven intriguing games per super\u2011club, beginning next February. Little wonder, then, that Europe\u2019s non-Premier League elite are so desperate to alter the format of the Champions League. It manifestly needs changing. A group stage in which roughly 80% of the games are largely meaningless while amplifying and reifying pre-existing financial inequalities cannot stand. But the plan proposed by the Juventus chairman, Andrea Agnelli, for four groups of eight somehow managed to make worse the structural inequality while comprising a raft of games that earlier results could have rendered entirely meaningless (as opposed to the present structure, in which a lot of theoretically meaningful games are rendered meaningless because one side is so much stronger than the other). That proposal appears to have been headed off by Premier League clubs \u2013 not, of course, for the good of the game, but because it threatened the financial advantages they have from being in the Premier League. The great irony is that, beyond the supreme marketing, the reason for the Premier League\u2019s popularity, for all its imbalances, is that it remains far less predictable than any other major league. There may be a lesson there.",

In those strange early days of our collaboration I was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jan/30/eddie-jones-england-six-nations\" title=\"\">still trying to figure out Jones</a>. I had heard stories about his abrasive coaching style, which had apparently left a trail of players weeping and hiding under tables from Canberra to Tokyo. I had also heard his whiplash quips and spiky insights because, as England coach, Jones\u2019s press conference highlights were never boring.</p> <p>Jones arrived in England rugby with a bang on 1 December 2015. England were in chaos after being knocked out in the group stages of a World Cup they had just hosted. Jones, who had masterminded the game of the tournament by inspiring Japan to victory over South Africa, replaced Stuart Lancaster as head coach. He achieved his first goals in startling style. England won <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/19/england-win-six-nations-grand-slam-france-match-report\" title=\"\">the 2016 </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/19/england-win-six-nations-grand-slam-france-match-report\" title=\"\">Six Nations</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/19/england-win-six-nations-grand-slam-france-match-report\" title=\"\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/19/england-win-six-nations-grand-slam-france-match-report\" title=\"\">grand </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/19/england-win-six-nations-grand-slam-france-match-report\" title=\"\">slam</a> and all <a href=\" https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jun/25/australia-england-third-test-match-report\" title=\"\">three Tests against the Wallabies</a> in his native Australia \u2013 and every match of the 13 they played under Jones in his first year in charge.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/14/rugby-world-cup-2019-england-team-guide\">Rugby World Cup 2019: England team guide</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Amid the praise, Jones overturned the first of my many preconceptions. After he had explained how he prepared his teams, using the example of Japan\u2019s shock defeat of the Springboks, Jones said something totally unexpected: \u201cMate, until that whistle blows, you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d</p> <p>Jones had told me how he had changed the culture of Japanese rugby with meticulous detail, and run a training camp to \u201cBeat the Boks\u201d which was as precise as it was ferocious. Yet, suddenly, he revealed that his intricate planning was ultimately shrouded in uncertainty. I was surprised but intrigued.</p> <p>The more we spoke, the more I understood what Jones meant. For all its brutality, rugby can be a delicate game of agonisingly fine margins. A player\u2019s confidence can be fleeting and, if it slips once the whistle blows, there is little a coach can do. After the game starts Jones\u2019s ability to influence the outcome is minimal. He relies on his players to make good decisions, to think and adapt. As a coach all he can really do in the midst of a game is to be smart in his use of substitutions.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s why preparation is everything,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you get it right, the chances of your team being successful are high. But in a team of human beings nothing is guaranteed.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"297c9d34411eb9e59243b61ef08b3d01ac299ab3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/297c9d34411eb9e59243b61ef08b3d01ac299ab3/37_37_2808_2235/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In the mud and muck at Randwick.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"796\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In the mud and muck at Randwick under Bob Dwyer, who later told a heartbroken Jones he would not be good enough to play for the Wallabies.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Rae/Fairfax Media via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Jones spoke vividly of how, shortly before Japan faced the mighty Springboks, he had no idea what would happen. After months of hammering home the message to his assistant coaches and players that they would beat South Africa, he was besieged with uncertainty. He was very quiet as the team bus rumbled slowly to the ground.</p> <p>Japan had won only one World Cup game in their entire history, 24 years before against Zimbabwe. The Springboks had been world champions in 1995 and 2007. Japan had lost every other World Cup match by an average of 48 points \u2013 with the most humiliating defeat being in 1995, when they conceded 145 points to New Zealand.</p> <p>His vulnerability and doubt were fascinating. It made Jones very human and much more interesting than the cartoonish persona of a hardboiled tyrant that some people foisted on him. He then leaned forward and explained the terrible beauty and consuming pressure of elite sport: \u201cThis is why we do it, mate. This is why we don\u2019t put on a suit every morning, pick up a briefcase and catch the same eight o\u2019clock train into a routine office job. This is the feeling you get nowhere else in life. It\u2019s this intensity, this fear, this hope, this thrill all knotted up in your gut. There is a need for courage in the face of adversity. This is what we do.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/sep/13/fiji-rugby-world-cup-pacific-islands-fairer-deal-ben-ryan\">Fiji pose World Cup threat but Pacific Islands need a much fairer deal | Ben Ryan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Jones was a teacher before he became a coach. The two vocations, for him, mirror each other. He loved teaching young players to steel themselves and to keep their heads clear and their hearts steady amid the heat of battle.</p> <p>England were on a roll which would eventually end in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/mar/13/england-winning-streak-new-zealand-record-match\" title=\"\">world-record equalling run of 18 consecutive Test victories</a>. Jones waved a cautionary finger and surprised me again. He warned that there would be dips and setbacks. \u201cWait until the third season, mate,\u201d he said. \u201cWe might hit a bit of a low then.\u201d</p> <p>Jones had reviewed the records of southern-hemisphere coaches who had worked in Six Nations rugby. They all suffered a third-year dip. After a honeymoon first season, in which they radically improved the fitness of their northern-hemisphere team, they continued to drive up skill levels in year two. By the time the third season unfolded the southern-hemisphere lift paled as familiarity set in and standards stagnated. This was a four-year project, Jones stressed, and the way he dealt with a third-year slide would shape England\u2019s World Cup chances in 2019.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6c105869ced6a323ed133b5a2d59b2d063c52e52\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6c105869ced6a323ed133b5a2d59b2d063c52e52/0_0_2200_1320/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With his Australia players after losing the Rugby World Cup final to England in 2003.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With his Australia players after losing the Rugby World Cup final to England in 2003.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Parks/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I raised a brow \u2013 but in <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/44507276\" title=\"\">2018</a><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/44507276\" title=\"\"> England hit the buffers under Jones</a>. They lost five matches in a row. His role as a messiah was replaced with depictions of Jones as a clown or an Aussie bastard. I saw him relatively often during this period and he was always calm.</p> <p>We revisited his 2016 prediction of the third-season blues but he had no interest in making any \u201cI told you so\u201d speeches. He was embroiled in the intricacies of coaching. His best players were fatigued after the Lions tour of New Zealand in the summer of 2017. But he had chosen to drive them harder than ever in training that autumn and again before the 2018 Six Nations. Jones wanted to put them under greater stress than ever before. He knew it might cost England in the short term \u2013 but they would be stronger and harder when it mattered most in 2019.</p> <p>I saw him soon after England had finished second-last in the 2018 Six Nations. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/17/england-ireland-six-nations-match-report\" title=\"\">Ireland had hammered his side at Twickenham</a> to win the grand slam and the rugby world was certain. England, under Jones, were shot; Ireland were the new joint favourites alongside New Zealand for the World Cup. \u201cWe\u2019ll be all right, mate,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThe plan is on track.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/13/ireland-wales-rugby-world-cup\">Simply the best? Can Ireland and Wales live up to top billing at World Cup? | Paul Rees</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I was beginning to understand how Jones worked and planned ahead. He had shared other memories which proved that, despite the uncertainty he felt just before every big game, results usually went the way he predicted. There was one striking example. Jones and Australia were ridiculed after losing 50-21 to New Zealand in Sydney in July 2003. It was a grim outcome; but Jones felt encouraged rather than crushed. He had seen how Australia could beat the All Blacks in a World Cup semi-final three months later.</p> <p>He drilled his team in a new plan which would dilute New Zealand\u2019s counterattacking game. Jones felt certain of victory and, as he expected, Australia cruised into the World Cup final with a 22-10 win. The rugby world was shocked. But his players had stuck flawlessly to the strategy and it was the most comfortable the Wallabies had ever looked against the All Blacks.</p> <p>Beyond the rugby I was immersed in the story of his life. Jones is resilient and tough, and he believes these qualities were passed on to him by his mother. The grit of Nellie Jones, who is still alive and well in Sydney at the age of 94, was forged in the second world war. After Pearl Harbour was bombed by Japanese planes in December 1941, she and her family were sent to separate internment camps \u2013 despite the fact that, as a 16-year-old girl in a Japanese family, she had been born and raised in California. President Franklin D Roosevelt was candid in referring to the relocation centres as concentration camps.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cc406ef3303067af3d3efeebcaadeca1bbdcc3aa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cc406ef3303067af3d3efeebcaadeca1bbdcc3aa/0_44_3110_1865/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Getting his hands on the Webb Ellis Cup with the Springboks in 2007 after being hired as a consultant.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Getting his hands on the Webb Ellis Cup with the Springboks in 2007 after being hired as a consultant.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason O\u2019Brien/Action Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nellie did not see her dad for four years. After the war she wanted to return home, to the orange orchard her father owned outside Sacramento, but her dad was embittered. He moved the family to Japan and they lived near Hiroshima, which had been devastated by the US atomic bomb on 6 August 1945. It did not help that Nellie looked Japanese and spoke the language. The locals knew she had been born in America and, at the age of 21 in 1946, Nellie felt like an outsider in Japan.</p> <p>Eventually she began working as an interpreter for the British Commonwealth Occupation Forces. Their headquarters were in Eta Jima, 20km from Hiroshima, and it was here that she met Ted Jones, an Australian soldier. They soon fell in love. In 1947 Corporal HJ Cooke had become the first Australian soldier to apply for permission to marry a Japanese woman and bring her home. The application was rejected after Arthur Caldwell, Australia\u2019s minister of immigration, refused her entry, saying: \u201cIt would be the grossest act of public indecency to permit a Japanese of either sex to pollute Australia.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/13/miyazaki-eddie-jones-england-rugby-world-cup-training-japan\">Paddleboarding and luxury: Miyazaki is Jones\u2019s special place for final preparation | Gerard Meagher</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It took until March 1952 for Japanese women to be allowed to enter Australia with their husbands. By 1956 Ted and Nellie Jones were one of 650 married couples that left Japan for Australia. They settled in Tasmania and Nellie faced yet more prejudice. Yet Nellie and Ted brought up their children, Diane, Vicky and Eddie, in a way that spared them this pain. They were raised with a sense of freedom and happiness.</p> <p>Jones began to understand his mother\u2019s past only when she gave him a copy of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/snow-falling-on-cedars.html\" title=\"\">David Guterson\u2019s </a><em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/snow-falling-on-cedars.html\" title=\"\">Snow Falling on Cedars</a></em> \u2013 a novel about a young Japanese-American man accused wrongly of killing a white fisherman. His trial plays out against the anti-Japanese sentiment that coursed through America in the wake of Pearl Harbour and the war. Nellie did not talk about racism or suffering. Instead she used the novel to illuminate her past.</p> <p>It was moving to hear this story and it helped Jones to talk more personally. He described his dad, Ted, as an uncomplicated Aussie, the best kind of larrikin who worked hard and enjoyed watching sport and having a couple of beers with his mates on the weekend. But something deeper stirred in Jones when we discussed his dad. His eyes often welled up with tears and he could not speak. Despite his loss, I think Jones was touched profoundly because he remembered how lucky he had been growing up in Sydney as Ted and Nellie\u2019s boy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"00272b3b67d26294cbfa65d3f714411584b9d291\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/00272b3b67d26294cbfa65d3f714411584b9d291/409_477_2830_3535/801.jpg\" alt=\"Eddie Jones as a young boy.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eddie Jones as a young boy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: tbc</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He never felt Japanese but from a young age Jones sensed that sport was his path to acceptance in Australian society. Jones could only remember one incident of racism in his playing career. He was playing for New South Wales against Queensland and their hooker called him a \u201cChink\u201d and a \u201cChinese bastard\u201d \u201cMate,\u201d Jones replied, \u201cyou\u2019re too stupid to know the difference between the Chinese and the Japanese.\u201d</p> <p>His life had been shaped by a fortunate coincidence. On his first day at kindergarten in the working-class Sydney suburb of La Perouse, Eddie sat next to Mark, Glen and Gary Ella, three Indigenous Australian brothers. Mark and Glen were twins; Gary was a year younger. Eddie and the Ellas would stick together through primary and high school. The Ella boys were just three of 12 children who lived with their parents in La Perouse \u2013 which was called \u201cthe Soweto of Sydney\u201d. There was no inside toilet nor any hot water in the Ella\u2019s two-bedroomed house but it rocked with laughter, love and life.</p> <p>Eddie and the Ellas went to Matraville High and played for, arguably, the greatest Australian schoolboy rugby team in history. The school was located in the shadow of Long Bay jail \u2013 the most notorious high-security prison in Australia. Both the school and the jail carried a disproportionately high percentage of young Indigenous people.</p> <p>Jones suggested I interview Bob Dwyer. Apart from steering Australia to victory over England in the 1991 World Cup final at Twickenham, Dwyer had been Jones\u2019s mentor after coaching him for years at Randwick Rugby Club. Dwyer had also been in the crowd on the famous day when Matraville beat St Joseph\u2019s, the most prestigious rugby school in Australia.</p> <p>Dwyer told me it looked like a Hollywood movie as the contrast between St Joey\u2019s and Matraville was comical. The privately educated boys resembled a well-drilled team of all-American jocks. Matraville\u2019s small backs were called \u201cthe blackline with a red tip\u201d because they consisted of six Indigenous kids and a red-haired winger, Greg Stores. Glen and Mark, Eddie\u2019s best friends, sported big black afros which would have fitted more funkily in the Jackson 5 than an Australian schoolboy rugby team. Eddie Jones was their tiny half-Japanese hooker.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/13/rugby-world-cup-2019-south-africa-team-guide\">Rugby World Cup 2019: South Africa team guide</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Joey\u2019s came out fast, like superstars, playing slick and aggressive rugby. But Matraville tackled hard and low, and ran at them relentlessly. Their backline was ridiculously flat as they passed the ball in dizzying patterns. Their joy and skill, particularly the Ellas and Lloyd Walker, a silky smooth Indigenous centre, astonished Dwyer. The four Indigenous boys and Jones joined Dwyer at Randwick \u2013 and all five of them, a third of the Matraville team, competed in international rugby years later. Jones, of course, did so as a coach.</p> <p>Dwyer broke the news to Jones that he would not play for Australia. He was Australia\u2019s coach in 1990 when it seemed certain he would select Jones as the new Wallaby hooker. Dwyer told me Jones looked sadder than anyone he had ever seen when he heard the news. Dwyer had chosen Phil Kearns, his young understudy at Randwick. Jones was heartbroken.</p> <p>His anguish was accentuated by the fact that he knew he was not really good enough to play Test rugby. He was far too small. Kearns was six foot tall and weighed 17.3 stone. So he was four inches taller and four and a half stone heavier than Jones. Kearns went on to play 67 Tests for Australia and was part of two World Cup-winning squads, in 1991 and 1999.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"021368a7ac37144513b5c34fabc052bf3e68c46c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/021368a7ac37144513b5c34fabc052bf3e68c46c/0_276_5082_3049/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Celebrating Japan\u2019s extraordinary win over South Africa in Brighton in 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Celebrating Japan\u2019s extraordinary win over South Africa in Brighton in 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It took him a year to recover but Jones turned himself into one of the world\u2019s great rugby coaches. The lessons of his past have strengthened him and Jones reached two successive Super Rugby finals with the ACT Brumbies, winning the southern hemisphere\u2019s premier regional tournament in 2001. Two years later he guided Australia to the World Cup final, where they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2013/oct/28/vault-rugby-world-cup-2003-england-victory\" title=\"\">held a far better team, England, to the last minute of extra-time</a> \u2013 when Jonny Wilkinson\u2019s drop goal settled the game.</p> <p>Four years later <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/oct/21/rugbyunion.rugbyworldcup200710\" title=\"\">Jones helped South Africa win the 2007 World Cup</a>. For all that he tried to underplay his 13-week consultancy role with the Springboks, two of their leading players told me they would not have won the tournament without Jones. John Smit, the Springboks\u2019 inspirational captain, and Fourie du Preez, their best player, were emphatic that Jones made the difference and ensured their victory.</p> <p>Smit and Du Preez also believe that, unless England suffer dramatic injuries to their key players in the 2019 World Cup, Jones will win the tournament for the first time as head coach.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/13/beer-ball-10-rugby-world-cup-rugby-union-japan-2019\">Beer dispensaries and ball pimples: 10 bits of Rugby World Cup miscellany</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Their views are echoed by George Gregan and Rod Kafer, who helped Jones devise a new way of playing rugby with the Brumbies. Gregan was Australia\u2019s captain in the 2003 World Cup and he insists Jones is the best and most empathetic coach in world rugby. His former players in Australia and Japan do not shy away from recalling the way in which he ripped them to shreds when they failed to do their job. But they also stress that Jones made every one of them a better player.</p> <p>Jones himself is more interested in revealing some of the worst mistakes he made during his 25-year career. He admits he should have resigned as Wallaby coach in 2003 because he was burnt out. But he flogged a limited team and clashed with his fellow coaches and administrators. Jones was sacked in 2005 after Australia lost seven of eight Tests \u2013 a painful end which left him in tears but vowing to return to the highest level of international coaching.</p> <p>He then made the mistake of rushing back into his next job, as head coach of the Queensland Reds, and he hit rock bottom in May 2007. The Reds lost 92-3 to the Bulls in Pretoria. Yet, typically of Jones\u2019s rollercoaster career, he was in the Springbok dressing room four months later as some of the same Bulls players helped South Africa <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/sep/15/rugbyunion.rugbyworldcup20078\" title=\"\">hammer England 36-0</a> in a World Cup pool game.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2140881c8e45e75eab42214e2a5774de89f72f6e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2140881c8e45e75eab42214e2a5774de89f72f6e/0_202_2815_3519/800.jpg\" alt=\"A Japan fan pays tribute to Jones and Japan\u2019s win over South Africa.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Japan fan pays tribute to Jones and Japan\u2019s win over South Africa.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Dwyer/Seconds Left/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>South Africa gave him three months of respite in a testing five years. From December 2003 to Christmas 2008 it was a grind. \u201cThat\u2019s appalling, mate,\u201d he told me, \u201cwhen you consider how much I love coaching.\u201d His last two years with the Wallabies were bleak. The Reds were even worse. The fun and harmony he experienced with the Springboks was then sucked dry by 14 months of grinding away at Saracens. Jones did not enjoy this spell in English club rugby.</p> <p>Japan was a backwater of the game but it rescued him when he returned to the country in 2009 to coach Suntory. He eventually became national coach in 2012. Jones transformed Japan as a rugby country and they, in turn, gave him new life as a coach. His impact on Japanese rugby ran deep. Whenever he returns to Japan now he is struck by the latest statistics detailing the number of kids playing rugby. The increase, since Japan beat South Africa in 2015, is between 150 and 200%.</p> <p>Of course there were difficult days in Japan. He lost his father and also suffered a stroke in October 2013. \u201cPeople always ask if the stroke changed me,\u201d Jones said in one of our many interviews. \u201cIt did. I think I became less intense and learned to relax more. I\u2019m sure the England players will find that amusing. Most of all, it made me grateful to be working again \u2013 in a job that gives me such pleasure and satisfaction.\u201d</p> <p>I was surprised again when Jones said that, after the stroke, he found comfort in going to church in Tokyo every Sunday. \u201cIt was a nice coincidence that the pastor was a South African,\u201d Jones said. \u201cHe was a big Afrikaans guy who loved rugby. I think he was pleased I turned up.\u201d</p> <p>Jones is a calmer coach now. He knows he cannot win every battle and needs to pick them wisely. English rugby is scarred by bitter in-fighting between the clubs and the union. If Jones had not learned some hard lessons while in charge of the Wallabies, he could have become swamped in the mess. But, apart from one obvious example when he became engaged in a spat with Bruce Craig, the owner of Bath, he has mostly kept a lid on his frustrations with the English game. He has stuck to his core task of selecting and coaching the national team.</p> <p>The way in which he has changed the culture of the England team, and discovered the leaders it had been lacking, is eye-opening. In one of his many distinctive insights he suggested Japanese and English society are not that different in terms of the layers that need to be stripped away. In the end he always seems to find a way to the heart of his team.</p> <p>I share the view of many of his former players that Jones might, just in time, have turned England into the team to beat in this World Cup. I remember him talking about the end of that epic World Cup match between South Africa and Japan in September 2015. His Japanese featherweights had slugged it out with the Springbok heavyweights all afternoon. There was a minute left on the clock when, with South Africa leading 32-29, Japan were awarded a penalty close to the Springbok tryline.</p> <p>An historic draw was on offer and Jones saw his captain, Michael Leitch, ask the referee how much time was left. \u201cTake the three!\u201d Jones screamed. \u201cTake the three!\u201d Leitch, who was born in New Zealand but had become thoroughly Japanese after 15 years in his adopted country, could not hear him. Jones had spent three years convincing Leitch to throw off the shackles of Japanese subservience to become a dynamic leader. That morning, over coffee, he had told Leitch to trust his instincts.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/14/rugby-world-cup-japan-new-zealand-england-eddie-jones-wales-ireland\">Brave new world: Japan braces for \u2018anything-can-happen\u2019 World Cup | Robert Kitson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Jones knew a draw would represent an incredible result.

      "bodyText": "Three years ago Eddie Jones surprised me for the first of many times. We met to discuss how we would work together on a book which was still a shadowy idea in the autumn of 2016. In those strange early days of our collaboration I was still trying to figure out Jones. I had heard stories about his abrasive coaching style, which had apparently left a trail of players weeping and hiding under tables from Canberra to Tokyo. I had also heard his whiplash quips and spiky insights because, as England coach, Jones\u2019s press conference highlights were never boring. Jones arrived in England rugby with a bang on 1 December 2015. England were in chaos after being knocked out in the group stages of a World Cup they had just hosted. Jones, who had masterminded the game of the tournament by inspiring Japan to victory over South Africa, replaced Stuart Lancaster as head coach. He achieved his first goals in startling style. England won the 2016 Six Nations grand slam and all three Tests against the Wallabies in his native Australia \u2013 and every match of the 13 they played under Jones in his first year in charge. Amid the praise, Jones overturned the first of my many preconceptions. After he had explained how he prepared his teams, using the example of Japan\u2019s shock defeat of the Springboks, Jones said something totally unexpected: \u201cMate, until that whistle blows, you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d Jones had told me how he had changed the culture of Japanese rugby with meticulous detail, and run a training camp to \u201cBeat the Boks\u201d which was as precise as it was ferocious. Yet, suddenly, he revealed that his intricate planning was ultimately shrouded in uncertainty. I was surprised but intrigued. The more we spoke, the more I understood what Jones meant. For all its brutality, rugby can be a delicate game of agonisingly fine margins. A player\u2019s confidence can be fleeting and, if it slips once the whistle blows, there is little a coach can do. After the game starts Jones\u2019s ability to influence the outcome is minimal. He relies on his players to make good decisions, to think and adapt. As a coach all he can really do in the midst of a game is to be smart in his use of substitutions. \u201cThat\u2019s why preparation is everything,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you get it right, the chances of your team being successful are high. But in a team of human beings nothing is guaranteed.\u201d Jones spoke vividly of how, shortly before Japan faced the mighty Springboks, he had no idea what would happen. After months of hammering home the message to his assistant coaches and players that they would beat South Africa, he was besieged with uncertainty. He was very quiet as the team bus rumbled slowly to the ground. Japan had won only one World Cup game in their entire history, 24 years before against Zimbabwe. The Springboks had been world champions in 1995 and 2007. Japan had lost every other World Cup match by an average of 48 points \u2013 with the most humiliating defeat being in 1995, when they conceded 145 points to New Zealand. His vulnerability and doubt were fascinating. It made Jones very human and much more interesting than the cartoonish persona of a hardboiled tyrant that some people foisted on him. He then leaned forward and explained the terrible beauty and consuming pressure of elite sport: \u201cThis is why we do it, mate. This is why we don\u2019t put on a suit every morning, pick up a briefcase and catch the same eight o\u2019clock train into a routine office job. This is the feeling you get nowhere else in life. It\u2019s this intensity, this fear, this hope, this thrill all knotted up in your gut. There is a need for courage in the face of adversity. This is what we do.\u201d Jones was a teacher before he became a coach. The two vocations, for him, mirror each other. He loved teaching young players to steel themselves and to keep their heads clear and their hearts steady amid the heat of battle. England were on a roll which would eventually end in a world-record equalling run of 18 consecutive Test victories. Jones waved a cautionary finger and surprised me again. He warned that there would be dips and setbacks. \u201cWait until the third season, mate,\u201d he said. \u201cWe might hit a bit of a low then.\u201d Jones had reviewed the records of southern-hemisphere coaches who had worked in Six Nations rugby. They all suffered a third-year dip. After a honeymoon first season, in which they radically improved the fitness of their northern-hemisphere team, they continued to drive up skill levels in year two. By the time the third season unfolded the southern-hemisphere lift paled as familiarity set in and standards stagnated. This was a four-year project, Jones stressed, and the way he dealt with a third-year slide would shape England\u2019s World Cup chances in 2019. I raised a brow \u2013 but in 2018 England hit the buffers under Jones. They lost five matches in a row. His role as a messiah was replaced with depictions of Jones as a clown or an Aussie bastard. I saw him relatively often during this period and he was always calm. We revisited his 2016 prediction of the third-season blues but he had no interest in making any \u201cI told you so\u201d speeches. He was embroiled in the intricacies of coaching. His best players were fatigued after the Lions tour of New Zealand in the summer of 2017. But he had chosen to drive them harder than ever in training that autumn and again before the 2018 Six Nations. Jones wanted to put them under greater stress than ever before. He knew it might cost England in the short term \u2013 but they would be stronger and harder when it mattered most in 2019. I saw him soon after England had finished second-last in the 2018 Six Nations. Ireland had hammered his side at Twickenham to win the grand slam and the rugby world was certain. England, under Jones, were shot; Ireland were the new joint favourites alongside New Zealand for the World Cup. \u201cWe\u2019ll be all right, mate,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThe plan is on track.\u201d I was beginning to understand how Jones worked and planned ahead. He had shared other memories which proved that, despite the uncertainty he felt just before every big game, results usually went the way he predicted. There was one striking example. Jones and Australia were ridiculed after losing 50-21 to New Zealand in Sydney in July 2003. It was a grim outcome; but Jones felt encouraged rather than crushed. He had seen how Australia could beat the All Blacks in a World Cup semi-final three months later. He drilled his team in a new plan which would dilute New Zealand\u2019s counterattacking game. Jones felt certain of victory and, as he expected, Australia cruised into the World Cup final with a 22-10 win. The rugby world was shocked. But his players had stuck flawlessly to the strategy and it was the most comfortable the Wallabies had ever looked against the All Blacks. Beyond the rugby I was immersed in the story of his life. Jones is resilient and tough, and he believes these qualities were passed on to him by his mother. The grit of Nellie Jones, who is still alive and well in Sydney at the age of 94, was forged in the second world war. After Pearl Harbour was bombed by Japanese planes in December 1941, she and her family were sent to separate internment camps \u2013 despite the fact that, as a 16-year-old girl in a Japanese family, she had been born and raised in California. President Franklin D Roosevelt was candid in referring to the relocation centres as concentration camps. Nellie did not see her dad for four years. After the war she wanted to return home, to the orange orchard her father owned outside Sacramento, but her dad was embittered. He moved the family to Japan and they lived near Hiroshima, which had been devastated by the US atomic bomb on 6 August 1945. It did not help that Nellie looked Japanese and spoke the language. The locals knew she had been born in America and, at the age of 21 in 1946, Nellie felt like an outsider in Japan. Eventually she began working as an interpreter for the British Commonwealth Occupation Forces. Their headquarters were in Eta Jima, 20km from Hiroshima, and it was here that she met Ted Jones, an Australian soldier. They soon fell in love. In 1947 Corporal HJ Cooke had become the first Australian soldier to apply for permission to marry a Japanese woman and bring her home. The application was rejected after Arthur Caldwell, Australia\u2019s minister of immigration, refused her entry, saying: \u201cIt would be the grossest act of public indecency to permit a Japanese of either sex to pollute Australia.\u201d It took until March 1952 for Japanese women to be allowed to enter Australia with their husbands. By 1956 Ted and Nellie Jones were one of 650 married couples that left Japan for Australia. They settled in Tasmania and Nellie faced yet more prejudice. Yet Nellie and Ted brought up their children, Diane, Vicky and Eddie, in a way that spared them this pain. They were raised with a sense of freedom and happiness. Jones began to understand his mother\u2019s past only when she gave him a copy of David Guterson\u2019s Snow Falling on Cedars \u2013 a novel about a young Japanese-American man accused wrongly of killing a white fisherman. His trial plays out against the anti-Japanese sentiment that coursed through America in the wake of Pearl Harbour and the war. Nellie did not talk about racism or suffering. Instead she used the novel to illuminate her past. It was moving to hear this story and it helped Jones to talk more personally. He described his dad, Ted, as an uncomplicated Aussie, the best kind of larrikin who worked hard and enjoyed watching sport and having a couple of beers with his mates on the weekend. But something deeper stirred in Jones when we discussed his dad. His eyes often welled up with tears and he could not speak. Despite his loss, I think Jones was touched profoundly because he remembered how lucky he had been growing up in Sydney as Ted and Nellie\u2019s boy. He never felt Japanese but from a young age Jones sensed that sport was his path to acceptance in Australian society. Jones could only remember one incident of racism in his playing career. He was playing for New South Wales against Queensland and their hooker called him a \u201cChink\u201d and a \u201cChinese bastard\u201d \u201cMate,\u201d Jones replied, \u201cyou\u2019re too stupid to know the difference between the Chinese and the Japanese.\u201d His life had been shaped by a fortunate coincidence. On his first day at kindergarten in the working-class Sydney suburb of La Perouse, Eddie sat next to Mark, Glen and Gary Ella, three Indigenous Australian brothers. Mark and Glen were twins; Gary was a year younger. Eddie and the Ellas would stick together through primary and high school. The Ella boys were just three of 12 children who lived with their parents in La Perouse \u2013 which was called \u201cthe Soweto of Sydney\u201d. There was no inside toilet nor any hot water in the Ella\u2019s two-bedroomed house but it rocked with laughter, love and life. Eddie and the Ellas went to Matraville High and played for, arguably, the greatest Australian schoolboy rugby team in history. The school was located in the shadow of Long Bay jail \u2013 the most notorious high-security prison in Australia. Both the school and the jail carried a disproportionately high percentage of young Indigenous people. Jones suggested I interview Bob Dwyer. Apart from steering Australia to victory over England in the 1991 World Cup final at Twickenham, Dwyer had been Jones\u2019s mentor after coaching him for years at Randwick Rugby Club. Dwyer had also been in the crowd on the famous day when Matraville beat St Joseph\u2019s, the most prestigious rugby school in Australia. Dwyer told me it looked like a Hollywood movie as the contrast between St Joey\u2019s and Matraville was comical. The privately educated boys resembled a well-drilled team of all-American jocks. Matraville\u2019s small backs were called \u201cthe blackline with a red tip\u201d because they consisted of six Indigenous kids and a red-haired winger, Greg Stores. Glen and Mark, Eddie\u2019s best friends, sported big black afros which would have fitted more funkily in the Jackson 5 than an Australian schoolboy rugby team. Eddie Jones was their tiny half-Japanese hooker. Joey\u2019s came out fast, like superstars, playing slick and aggressive rugby. But Matraville tackled hard and low, and ran at them relentlessly. Their backline was ridiculously flat as they passed the ball in dizzying patterns. Their joy and skill, particularly the Ellas and Lloyd Walker, a silky smooth Indigenous centre, astonished Dwyer. The four Indigenous boys and Jones joined Dwyer at Randwick \u2013 and all five of them, a third of the Matraville team, competed in international rugby years later. Jones, of course, did so as a coach. Dwyer broke the news to Jones that he would not play for Australia. He was Australia\u2019s coach in 1990 when it seemed certain he would select Jones as the new Wallaby hooker. Dwyer told me Jones looked sadder than anyone he had ever seen when he heard the news. Dwyer had chosen Phil Kearns, his young understudy at Randwick. Jones was heartbroken. His anguish was accentuated by the fact that he knew he was not really good enough to play Test rugby. He was far too small. Kearns was six foot tall and weighed 17.3 stone. So he was four inches taller and four and a half stone heavier than Jones. Kearns went on to play 67 Tests for Australia and was part of two World Cup-winning squads, in 1991 and 1999. It took him a year to recover but Jones turned himself into one of the world\u2019s great rugby coaches. The lessons of his past have strengthened him and Jones reached two successive Super Rugby finals with the ACT Brumbies, winning the southern hemisphere\u2019s premier regional tournament in 2001. Two years later he guided Australia to the World Cup final, where they held a far better team, England, to the last minute of extra-time \u2013 when Jonny Wilkinson\u2019s drop goal settled the game. Four years later Jones helped South Africa win the 2007 World Cup. For all that he tried to underplay his 13-week consultancy role with the Springboks, two of their leading players told me they would not have won the tournament without Jones. John Smit, the Springboks\u2019 inspirational captain, and Fourie du Preez, their best player, were emphatic that Jones made the difference and ensured their victory. Smit and Du Preez also believe that, unless England suffer dramatic injuries to their key players in the 2019 World Cup, Jones will win the tournament for the first time as head coach. Their views are echoed by George Gregan and Rod Kafer, who helped Jones devise a new way of playing rugby with the Brumbies. Gregan was Australia\u2019s captain in the 2003 World Cup and he insists Jones is the best and most empathetic coach in world rugby. His former players in Australia and Japan do not shy away from recalling the way in which he ripped them to shreds when they failed to do their job. But they also stress that Jones made every one of them a better player. Jones himself is more interested in revealing some of the worst mistakes he made during his 25-year career. He admits he should have resigned as Wallaby coach in 2003 because he was burnt out. But he flogged a limited team and clashed with his fellow coaches and administrators. Jones was sacked in 2005 after Australia lost seven of eight Tests \u2013 a painful end which left him in tears but vowing to return to the highest level of international coaching. He then made the mistake of rushing back into his next job, as head coach of the Queensland Reds, and he hit rock bottom in May 2007. The Reds lost 92-3 to the Bulls in Pretoria. Yet, typically of Jones\u2019s rollercoaster career, he was in the Springbok dressing room four months later as some of the same Bulls players helped South Africa hammer England 36-0 in a World Cup pool game. South Africa gave him three months of respite in a testing five years. From December 2003 to Christmas 2008 it was a grind. \u201cThat\u2019s appalling, mate,\u201d he told me, \u201cwhen you consider how much I love coaching.\u201d His last two years with the Wallabies were bleak. The Reds were even worse. The fun and harmony he experienced with the Springboks was then sucked dry by 14 months of grinding away at Saracens. Jones did not enjoy this spell in English club rugby. Japan was a backwater of the game but it rescued him when he returned to the country in 2009 to coach Suntory. He eventually became national coach in 2012. Jones transformed Japan as a rugby country and they, in turn, gave him new life as a coach. His impact on Japanese rugby ran deep. Whenever he returns to Japan now he is struck by the latest statistics detailing the number of kids playing rugby. The increase, since Japan beat South Africa in 2015, is between 150 and 200%. Of course there were difficult days in Japan. He lost his father and also suffered a stroke in October 2013. \u201cPeople always ask if the stroke changed me,\u201d Jones said in one of our many interviews. \u201cIt did. I think I became less intense and learned to relax more. I\u2019m sure the England players will find that amusing. Most of all, it made me grateful to be working again \u2013 in a job that gives me such pleasure and satisfaction.\u201d I was surprised again when Jones said that, after the stroke, he found comfort in going to church in Tokyo every Sunday. \u201cIt was a nice coincidence that the pastor was a South African,\u201d Jones said. \u201cHe was a big Afrikaans guy who loved rugby. I think he was pleased I turned up.\u201d Jones is a calmer coach now. He knows he cannot win every battle and needs to pick them wisely. English rugby is scarred by bitter in-fighting between the clubs and the union. If Jones had not learned some hard lessons while in charge of the Wallabies, he could have become swamped in the mess. But, apart from one obvious example when he became engaged in a spat with Bruce Craig, the owner of Bath, he has mostly kept a lid on his frustrations with the English game. He has stuck to his core task of selecting and coaching the national team. The way in which he has changed the culture of the England team, and discovered the leaders it had been lacking, is eye-opening. In one of his many distinctive insights he suggested Japanese and English society are not that different in terms of the layers that need to be stripped away. In the end he always seems to find a way to the heart of his team. I share the view of many of his former players that Jones might, just in time, have turned England into the team to beat in this World Cup. I remember him talking about the end of that epic World Cup match between South Africa and Japan in September 2015. His Japanese featherweights had slugged it out with the Springbok heavyweights all afternoon. There was a minute left on the clock when, with South Africa leading 32-29, Japan were awarded a penalty close to the Springbok tryline. An historic draw was on offer and Jones saw his captain, Michael Leitch, ask the referee how much time was left. \u201cTake the three!\u201d Jones screamed. \u201cTake the three!\u201d Leitch, who was born in New Zealand but had become thoroughly Japanese after 15 years in his adopted country, could not hear him. Jones had spent three years convincing Leitch to throw off the shackles of Japanese subservience to become a dynamic leader. That morning, over coffee, he had told Leitch to trust his instincts. Jones knew a draw would represent an incredible result. So he was furious when he realised Leitch had rejected the match-saving penalty and was trying for the win. But Leitch had shown bravery and belief. He was prepared to risk defeat to get the win. He had absorbed the lessons Jones had given him. All these years later Jones looked at me and grinned. \u201cI thought: \u2018Good on you, mate. Go for it.\u2019\u201d Japan shocked the world by scoring a last-minute try to seal victory. South Africa 32, Japan 34. That afternoon in Brighton led directly to Jones becoming England coach and now, four years later, he is back in Japan for another World Cup. Today Jones and his squad are in the coastal resort of Miyazaki preparing for their opening match, against Tonga next Sunday. He will relentlessly badger, urge and encourage them \u2013 and hunt down any sign of complacency. Jones believes strongly that England can become world champions. Soon it will be up to his players to show the same courage and resolve Leitch and Japan did when they made history for themselves. I can still see Jones now, reliving that match-winning moment for Japan, and telling me: \u201cMy captain and my team surprised me. But we had prepared them for that very moment and they had the courage to take it. As a coach there is nothing better. I sat back and thought: \u2018This is their moment and you did your bit to help them get here.\u2019\u201d Jones paused and then, eventually, he nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s why we do it, mate. That\u2019s what makes it such a beautiful game.\u201d My Life and Rugby by Eddie Jones, with Donald McRae, will be published on 21 November by Macmillan",

That remains their only victory over Manchester City in the top flight since 1993 - thank Mark Robins and Lee Power for that one - though they did win 2-1 in a second-tier fixture in 2001.</p> <p><strong>Playing for Man City that day: Danny Tiatto, Gerard Wiekens, Jeff Whitley, Kevin Horlock and Danny Granville.</strong> They\u2019ve come a long way, huh.

This is football, and there\u2019s always hope.</p> <p><strong>So can Norwich spring a shock? </strong>Or will Manchester City keep on keepin\u2019 on? We\u2019ll find out soon enough. It\u2019s very much on!</p> <p><strong>Kick off: </strong>5.30pm BST. </p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "No word from Pep, who is presumably busy kicking Otamendi and Stones around the dressing room like a pair of old socks. So it\u2019s time for this MBM to grind to a halt. Paul MacInnes was our man in Norwich tonight, and here\u2019s his match report. Enjoy, and thanks for reading! Daniel Farke gives Sky his verdict. \u201cWe are absolutely delighted, it\u2019s a great day for us. Carrow Road is absolutely buzzing. It is good for our owners, you can\u2019t ask for more kind-hearted people. We have to stick to what we believe. You cannot change for one game. Of course we would have liked more possession, but sometimes you can\u2019t against a team like Manchester City. We have had an unbelievably tough start, against the European champions, the English champions and the Europa League champions. And we are on six points after five games, which is decent. We have to stay calm. The fans are allowed to celebrate, but we have an unbelievably difficult game in Burnley. But we can enjoy this moment.\u201d Half of that interview was practically obliterated by nearby fans singing paeans to their manager. They love this guy, and no wonder. Kenny McLean speaks to Sky. \u201cI don\u2019t think many people gave us a chance. But when our backs are to the wall we come out fighting. Our performance was excellent from the first minute. They\u2019re one of the best teams out there, and we\u2019ve put ourselves against them and done an excellent job. It gives us confidence, something to build on, and shows we\u2019re good enough at this level.\u201d Todd Cantwell adds: \u201cWe\u2019re showing this isn\u2019t an easy place to come and get points. To beat a team like that shows how together we all are. In the changing room, we know what we\u2019re capable of. We looked forward to the game. We went out with the mentality that we had nothing to lose and a lot to win. It shows us that anything is possible.\u201d It\u2019s fair to say nobody saw this coming. But Norwich City fully deserve the three points. They were magnificent to the very last man, as collectively impressive as John Stones and Nicolas Otamendi were individually poor. Manchester City attacked with their usual panache; they pushed and probed, coming at the hosts from all angles. But they couldn\u2019t do enough to dig themselves out of the hole their central defenders had dumped them in. It\u2019s a result that means Liverpool are five points clear of second placed Manchester City at the top, while Norwich find themselves catapulted up to 12th spot. Carrow Road celebrates according to specifications set out by Delia all those years ago. Come on! Let\u2019s be having ya! Nope! Norwich City have vanquished the champions! 90 min +4: See 90 min +2, only this time it\u2019s Sterling having a go. The crowd go ballistic as the ball is snaffled by Krul. Norwich so close now! Cantwell goes up the other end and takes the ball to the corner. He\u2019s nudged over by Walker. Can Manchester City launch one last attack? 90 min +3: Jesus spins this way and that on the edge of the Norwich box. He eventually crafts enough space for a shot, but it\u2019s weak and straight at Krul. What a finish! 90 min +2: Aguero dribbles down the left and cuts inside. He reaches the edge of the area and opens up his body, looking to sidefoot into the bottom right. But his shot has no oomph, and Krul can claim easily! 90 min: The champions come again - again - City winning a corner on the left. And that corner leads to another on the right! It\u2019s cleared, but this is attack versus defence in the extreme style. And there will be four added minutes! 89 min: Srbeny comes on for Stiepermann. Manchester City win another corner. It\u2019s cleared. But Carrow Road has gone very quiet. From the corner, Jesus scampers left to right across the face of the box. He lays off to Rodri, who rakes a low shot through a thicket of players and into the bottom left! Krul should have saved that, but his hand was weak. Could the champions save themselves? 87 min: Cantwell comes sliding through Walker, who was perambulating down the right. It\u2019s a free kick and a booking. The resulting free kick is half cleared by Norwich, though Sterling now comes again down the left. He crosses deep. Mahrez wins a header at the far post. It\u2019s either going in, from a tight angle, or will be tapped over the line by Aguero. But Krul tips over magnificently! 86 min: Sterling George Bests his way across the face of the Norwich goal, left to right, but can\u2019t get a meaningful shot away. His tame effort is helped on by Jesus, albeit merely into the hands of Krul. 85 min: Sterling loops a cross into the mixer from the left. Too high for Aguero, who spins away in agony. Goal kick. 84 min: Jesus dribbles like billy-o inside the Norwich box, but is swarmed and can\u2019t work space to shoot. \u201cThis is glorious football,\u201d opines Mary Waltz. \u201cNot from a skills standpoint but in regards to the heart.\u201d It\u2019s quite the scene all right. 83 min: Norwich make their first change of the evening. Buendia is replaced by Drmic. 82 min: A corner for Manchester City as Jesus\u2019s header from close range is deflected over the bar. Krul goes walkabout in an attempt to claim De Bruyne\u2019s set piece, but he gets away with it, the ball sailing over everyone in the box and out for a goal kick. 80 min: McLean\u2019s free kick isn\u2019t up to much, and Ederson snaffles. A fine atmosphere rumbling in Carrow Road, though plenty of tension too, as a shock victory becomes an increasingly realistic prospect now. 79 min: Pukki is brought down by the hapless Otamendi, to the left of the Manchester City box. A chance for Norwich to load the box. 77 min: Sterling sashays in from the left and puts a gorgeous cross onto Aguero\u2019s head, six yards out. Aguero gets too much purchase on his header, and the ball sails wildly over the bar. What a miss! 75 min: It\u2019s all gone scrappy in midfield, which is exactly how Norwich like it right now. The champions need to relocate their mojo and quick. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I must protest,\u201d begins Mac Millings. \u201cSale of the Century was a well-oiled machine, whose running time zipped by like Raheem Sterling past a hapless Bulgarian. And the theme tune is one of the Seven Wonders of the World.\u201d I\u2019ll concede that final point, for sure. But the self-styled \u201cquiz of the week\u201d? Nope. Not a patch on Winner Takes All with Tarby, Monkhouse-era Fortunes, or even 3-2-1. 73 min: Buendia sends a harmless free kick wide right of the goal. Then Bernardo Silva eventually leaves the stage, and Mahrez fills the gap. 72 min: Pukki and Buendia over-elaborate again, on the edge of the Manchester City box. Once again a chance to carve out a shooting opportunity goes begging. But then Bernardo Silva clatters into Byram and it\u2019s a free kick 30 yards out. 71 min: Riyad Mahrez prepares to come on for Bernardo Silva. But Pep wants to give his man a few more notes. So play continues. 69 min: Bernardo Silva should be sent clear down the left by Sterling, but the pass is poor and Amadou is able to block. Then the Manchester City man is booked for a cynical tug on McLean as he chases back the other way. 67 min: Pukki, Buendia and Cantwell drive at the creaky Manchester City back line, but over-elaborate and fail to create a shooting chance. That was poor. Manchester City go up the other end, Walker winning a corner on the right, Otamendi sending his header straight at Krul. It\u2019s difficult to see this ending 3-1. 66 min: De Bruyne drives at Stiepermann down the right. He drops a shoulder and threatens to go past, but slips over. Norwich had the sprinklers on at half-time, incidentally. 65 min: Ah no, he\u2019s clattered into the back of Rodri, albeit clumsily rather than aggressively. Still, he doesn\u2019t bother arguing the point. 64 min: A yellow card for McLean. Not sure what that\u2019s for, maybe he\u2019s crossed the line with overly strident patter. 62 min: A free kick for Manchester City out on the left. De Bruyne curls it into the mixer. Stones can\u2019t get a head on it. Neither can Aguero. The ball nearly creeps all the way into the bottom right, but Krul claims as Carrow Road holds its collective breath. 60 min: Manchester City are coming at Norwich hard. The corner\u2019s cleared, but Sterling\u2019s soon rushing down the inside right. Krul rushes off his line and very nearly clatters him. But he stops just before making contact. No penalty. Another corner. And then another corner! This is relentless. Norwich eventually clear, the ball ending up back at Ederson\u2019s feet, but this promises to feel like the longest half-hour in Norwich since the days of Sale of the Century with Nicholas Parsons. 59 min: Aguero has a snapshot that\u2019s deflected out for a corner on the left. De Bruyne\u2019s very first involvement is nearly an assist: he hits the corner long, and Otamendi nearly bundles in at the far post. But it\u2019s deflected out for another corner instead. 57 min: Pep has seen enough. Gundogan and David Silva are hooked, with Gabriel Jesus and Kevin De Bruyne coming on. 56 min: Manchester City continue to do their passing thing. But they\u2019re finding touch with uncharacteristic regularity too, and the crowd holler at every misplaced sidefoot. \u201cJudging from the photographs in your report, it looks like those East Anglians are actually watching the match, not their mobiles,\u201d notes Simon Cordery. \u201cThey even seem to be celebrating instead of taking pictures. How retro!\u201d They\u2019ve been singing and chanting and everything, too. It\u2019s almost as though Delia\u2019s message sunk in all those years ago. We should all pay attention to the sainted Delia. 54 min: But be under no illusion: Norwich still have a lot of work to do if they\u2019re to get anything out of Manchester City, who aren\u2019t treble-winning champions for nothing. Aguero nearly jigs his way through the middle of the park and into the Norwich box. Amadou blocks just in time. 53 min: Aguero tries to get his team back into this match. He busies himself down the inside left and has a shot that\u2019s deflected over the bar by Godfrey. The resulting corner leads to Walker having a dig from distance. He shanks the ball miles to the left, then screams in extreme displeasure at his team-mates. 51 min: Stones and Otamendi. Playing out from the back, Stones rolls a hospital pass across the front of the box for Otamendi, who embellishes the error by taking a heavy touch of his own. Buendi steps in, nicks the ball and enters the box down the inside-right channel. He draws Ederson and slips a pass inside for Pukki who takes a touch and lifts the ball into the net, past a sprawling Stones! What a complete farce! 49 min: Norwich should be three up. Stones faffs around in the middle of the park, like Stones does. He gifts the ball to Stiepermann, who sends Pukki away down the left. Pukki enters the area and screws a weird shot across Ederson and out of play for a corner. But no matter! Because ... 47 min: The late-evening, late-summer sun streams across Carrow Road as Manchester City take up where they left off. On the attack. Bernardo Silva sends a couple of crosses in from the left. Amadou and Godfrey take turns to clear. It could be a long, long second half for the hosts if it\u2019s to continue like this. Here we go again! Manchester City get the second half underway. No changes! \u201cCan Daniel Farke please come and manage Scotland when he\u2019s finished giving Norwich fans the time of their lives?\u201d asks Simon McMahon. \u201cWe\u2019d take Pep too if he gets fed up winning things.\u201d Half-time team-talk. A small nod to Norwich / Manchester City matches of yore. We said there\u2019d be goals, right? Not sure any of us would have predicted they came along as they did, mind. What a second half we have in store! 45 min +1: Byram is booked for a cynical tug on Bernardo Silva, as the Manchester City midfielder looks to break down the left. All of a sudden, Norwich really need to hear the half-time whistle. Wow, did Manchester City need this. Just before the break, Bernardo Silva finds a little pocket of space out on the left. He curls a perfect ball onto the head, six yards out, of Aguero, who plants a header into the bottom right, giving Krul absolutely no chance. Game on! 43 min: It\u2019s attack versus defence, though Manchester City aren\u2019t causing their hosts too many problems. Norwich are holding their shape well. 41 min: Zinchenko goes down after some garden-variety nonsense with Stiepermann, a dispute over a throw. Zinchenko rolls around a bit, holding his ankle, screaming, after a light trip amid a petty squabble. To Pep\u2019s eternal credit, he races to the touchline and starts bollocking his own player, telling him to get up. You have got to love Pep Guardiola. 39 min: Sterling switches to the right wing in the hope of making something happen for Manchester City. He drops a shoulder and purchases a cheap corner off Lewis. Gundogan takes the set piece, whipping it low towards the near post. David Silva ghosts in, hoping to turn the ball into the bottom right, but can only clank it out for a goal kick. 37 min: Walker crosses deep from the right. Buendia should let the ball fly out for a goal kick, but head-juggles it instead. Krul steps in to claim as his team-mate faffs dangerously. A reminder that Norwich have a lot of work still to do if they\u2019re to hold onto this unexpected lead ... and that they\u2019ll need to keep calm heads. Nothing\u2019s a given when you\u2019re playing a team as relentless as Manchester City. 35 min: Sterling skedaddles down the left and curls a low ball into a crowded area. Krul stoops to gather without fuss. 34 min: ... there are claims for handball. The ball definitely hit Stones on the arm, during an aerial challenge, but the referee isn\u2019t interested. VAR doesn\u2019t get involved either. Norwich are incensed, but they have to make do with another corner, from which nothing occurs. 33 min: A free kick for Norwich out on the right, and a chance to load the box. The set piece is only half cleared, and Pukki grafts to win another corner. From which ... 31 min: Sterling hits the post! Bernardo Silva loops a header across the face of the Norwich goal, right to left, and Sterling crashes his own header onto the left-hand upright. Nothing\u2019s going for Manchester City right now. But the margins are close. Sterling and Aguero will both wonder how they\u2019re not on the scoresheet. 30 min: Walker is livid, arguing that Pukki was offside when he was sent through. But it was Walker who\u2019d played the striker on. VAR checks, and the goal stands. Well, well, well. The champions are two down! Buendi spins and flicks himself into space, just inside his own half. He feeds Stiepermann in the centre circle. Stiepermann slips an instant pass down the inside right, and Pukki is sent clear! He doesn\u2019t have the pace to stay ahead of Walker, but no matter, because Manchester City are so light at the back. He squares the ball for Cantwell, who sidefoots into an empty net! 27 min: More Manchester City possession. Ping, ping, ping, ping. Suddenly Sterling zips in from the left and whips a vicious cross towards Aguero, on the right-hand corner of the six-yard box. Aguero flashes a header over from close range. You\u2019ve seen him score plenty of those. \u201cCan we declare now please?\u201d begs David Jameson. 25 min: Sterling whips a high cross in from the left. Krul comes off his line and claims with great confidence. He\u2019s also applauded for his handling when Walker bombs down the right and hits a low cross-cum-shot towards the bottom right. The keeper\u2019s not to be beaten at his near post. 23 min: Manchester City continue where they left off, just before the goal. A lot of possession in the Norwich half. This could be a crucial ten or 15 minutes for the hosts, if they\u2019re serious about causing a shock today. 21 min: Sterling tries to hit back in short order, but his speculative shot drifts well wide of the right-hand post. Here\u2019s Gary Naylor. \u201cTwo words ... David Narey.\u201d Scottish fans of a certain vintage will know exactly what he\u2019s predicting here. At least nobody can accuse McLean of having scored a toe-poke, huh. 20 min: If there\u2019s one chink in Manchester City\u2019s armour, it\u2019s defending the near post at set pieces. Some more evidence there. And a wee test for the champions now. Plenty of time to get back into this, just as Liverpool did against Newcastle after falling behind earlier in the day. This is very simple. An outswinger sent towards the near post. McLean rises highest - barely challenged, in fact - and plants a powerful header into the top right! As easy as that! Ederson had no chance. That header was crashed home. Carrow Road erupts! 18 min: A little space for Tettey down the right. His low cross is hacked out of play by Zinchenko, and this will be Norwich\u2019s first corner of the afternoon. And from it ... 16 min: Aguero\u2019s causes more havoc down the inside-left channel. He pivots and shimmies, twists and flicks, and very nearly tees up David Silva just inside the area. Not quite. Sterling was lurking with intent too. But the home side hold firm. 14 min: An absurd amount of space for Gundogan, 25 yards out. Inexplicably, he turns down the opportunity to have a good old whack at goal, instead slipping the ball wide right for Bernardo Silva, who clumps it out for a goal kick himself. 12 min: Aguero breaks through a half-arsed Tettey challenge and scampers with purpose down the inside left. He slips a pass outside to Sterling, who shapes to shoot just inside the area but can\u2019t get anything away. For a second, Manchester City suddenly looked very threatening. 10 min: Walker, under no pressure whatsoever in the centre circle, sends a simple pass wide right deep and high into the stand. That was a bit surreal. The champions are dominating, as you\u2019d expect, but they haven\u2019t quite clicked into gear yet. It may take a few more minutes to brush off that post-international-break rust. 9 min: Stiepermann trundles down the left and gets the better of Walker with a cute flick. Having circumvented the full back, he\u2019s got a pass on to release Pukki down the middle, but the striker can\u2019t trap it while running at full speed between Stones and Otamendi. That was half a chance. 7 min: Some of the metronomic Manchester City passing. Norwich can\u2019t get a sniff at the minute. 5 min: Manchester City take a couple of liberties when passing the ball around at the back. Stones, then Ederson, both give Buendia a sniff. They don\u2019t lose possession, but it looked a little risky for a second there. 3 min: David Silva takes. It\u2019s an uncharacteristically poor effort, hitting the first man. But that first man, Lewis, slices backwards and allows Rodri a header from ten yards. Fortunately for Norwich, Rodri\u2019s effort is tame and loops straight into the arms of Krul. 2 min: Manchester City don\u2019t take long to establish themselves. They ping it around the middle of the park awhile, then suddenly man-of-the-moment Sterling makes good down the left. He lays off to David Silva, who earns the first corner of the match. And we\u2019re off! Norwich City get the ball rolling. A fine Saturday-afternoon-spent-in-the-public-bar atmosphere at Carrow Road. The hosts stroke it around the back awhile, then Krul blooters it forward so a couple of the Manchester City lads can get a touch. All good fun. A word on the training tops. You wouldn\u2019t have thought it would be easy to outdo Manchester City\u2019s tribute to the Grateful Dead ... ... but Norwich have managed it. A colour palette Ozric Tentacles would baulk at using on their sleeves. Two shades of pink, orange, grey, black, green and yellow. It\u2019s bold and brave and very 1993, like the team themselves. The game starts in a second or two, and Norwich will be in first-choice yellow while Manchester City will wear black. Daniel Farke speaks to Sky about Norwich\u2019s long injury list. \u201cThere is no time to cry. We are not here to raise the white flag. We want to give it a go and try to be competitive. Tim Krul had a slight injury yesterday and was still not good in the warm-up, so I needed to name two keepers on the bench.\u201d Pep adds: \u201cI am pretty sure the game will be open. They will defend deep if we are good, but they like to play that way, they won the Championship playing that way. So why should they change?\u201d He\u2019s then asked if this is time for the erratic John Stones to stake a claim as a first-pick central defender. The response isn\u2019t exactly a ringing endorsement, as he references Fernandinho, the rest of the squad and young players in the academy. Norwich make four changes to the team named for the 2-0 defeat at West Ham. Sam Byram, Ibrahim Amadou, Kenny McLean and Alex Tetty come in for Christoph Zimmermann, Moritz Leitner, Tom Trybull and Max Aarons. Manchester City make three changes to the side that swatted aside Brighton 4-0. Kevin De Bryune and Riyad Mahrez drop to the bench, making way for Bernardo Silva and Ilkay Gundogan. The injured Aymeric Laporte is replaced by John Stones. Norwich City: Krul, Byram, Amadou, Godfrey, Lewis, McLean, Tettey, Emi, Stiepermann, Cantwell, Pukki. Subs: Hanley, Heise, Drmic, Fahrmann, Srbeny, McGovern, Idah. Manchester City: Ederson, Walker, Stones, Otamendi, Zinchenko, Gundogan, Rodri, Silva, Bernardo Silva, Aguero, Sterling. Subs: Bravo, Gabriel Jesus, De Bruyne, Fernandinho, Mahrez, Joao Cancelo, Foden. Referee: Kevin Friend (Leicestershire). It\u2019s fair to say that Norwich City and Manchester City like to bring the goals. Here are half a dozen specially selected scorelines from the last decade: 7-0, 6-1, 5-1, 4-3, 3-2, 3-0. Forget that this fixture ended goalless the last time it was played, in March 2016. Or that it remained 0-0 the time before that, in February 2014. Because more often than not, these two serve up a high-scoring confection. Norwich are usually on the receiving end. Of all those eye-opening scorelines, the Canaries were winners in just one game, a 3-2 victory at the Etihad in May 2013, Jonathan Howson grabbing the decisive goal in a back-and-forth thriller. That remains their only victory over Manchester City in the top flight since 1993 - thank Mark Robins and Lee Power for that one - though they did win 2-1 in a second-tier fixture in 2001. Playing for Man City that day: Danny Tiatto, Gerard Wiekens, Jeff Whitley, Kevin Horlock and Danny Granville. They\u2019ve come a long way, huh. As the modern world\u2019s all-conquering treble winners, they\u2019re strong favourites to grab all three points off newly promoted Norwich. But Daniel Farke\u2019s side have already impressed against Liverpool and Chelsea on their Premier League return, albeit in defeat, and Teemu Pukki has scored 15 times in his last 15 matches for club and country. This is football, and there\u2019s always hope. So can Norwich spring a shock? Or will Manchester City keep on keepin\u2019 on? We\u2019ll find out soon enough. It\u2019s very much on! Kick off: 5.30pm BST.",

Firmino had been on the pitch two minutes as a replacement for Divock Origi, who twisted an ankle early on but continued until his substitution was inevitable. The Brazilian\u2019s first contribution was to dispossess Atsu and pierce the visiting defence with a perfectly weighted ball into Man\u00e9. Dubravka was slow to react and weak in his attempt to collect. The ball spun over the Newcastle keeper and Man\u00e9 converted into an unguarded net. Firmino\u2019s second assist was exquisite. Krafth had squandered a glorious chance to equalise when blazing over an Atsu cross. Liverpool otherwise maintained the pressure and extended their lead when Salah played a one-two with Firmino, took the return away from two defenders and found the far corner. But that does not do justice to the pass from Liverpool\u2019s No 9, who rolled the first touch under his right foot before flicking the ball into Salah\u2019s run with his left instep. Sch\u00e4r was injured simply attempting to keep up with Salah \u2013 a thankless task. Liverpool cruise on.",

      "body": "<p>Nothing is true and everything is possible. That was my one-line attempt to sum up the politics and propaganda that enveloped Russia at the start of the 21st century. It was a world where politicians no longer cared whether they were caught lying; where old ideologies were dead and conspiracy thinking had become the new way to explain the world; where all the old political categories (socialist and liberal, conservative and communist) seemed utterly meaningless and it was unclear what political parties stood for; where warped nostalgia and vague emotive calls to \u201cRaise Russia From Its Knees\u201d had taken over from any rational idea of the future.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>The same pathologies of public opinion I saw in Putinist Russia are now prevalent here</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In 2010, I came back to the UK because, in the words of my naive self, I wanted to live in a world where words had meaning. Sure the west was its own sort of mess, but politicians in Washington and Westminster still pretended to respect facts, sneered at conspiracy theories, tried to sound rational.</p> <p>Then came the revolutionary year of 2016 and ever since then I\u2019ve had the distinct deja vu that the same pathologies of public opinion I saw in Putinist Russia are now prevalent here. This is even reflected in one\u2019s personal life. Conspiracy theories had become so all-encompassing in noughties Russia that I found myself inching gently into conversations, feeling my way through to gently check whether my discussant thought all democracies were just run by cabals.</p> <p>Unlike the Soviet Union, the Putin regime was less obsessed with total ideological control and more on sowing polarisation within society, between what the Kremlin called the \u201cPutin majority\u201d (what they claimed were the \u201cordinary people\u201d) and everybody else, to undermine trust and a shared reality to the point where no coherent opposition could ever coalesce.</p> <p>As I write this from LA, I now find myself inching into conversations with similar caution \u2013 is my dinner party companion going to turn out to be a believer that Obama was a secret Muslim who wasn\u2019t born in the USA?</p> <p>Just as in Russia the temptation is to just tune out, to stop engaging with one another. When any political conversation risks leading to hyperpartisan hysteria, when the other side are categorised as traitors or fifth columnists, it\u2019s safer to talk about gardening instead.</p> <p>As we slip and stumble towards elections on both sides of the Atlantic, I can see the threat of the same mistakes that made 2016 so destructively polarising.

      "bodyText": "Nothing is true and everything is possible. That was my one-line attempt to sum up the politics and propaganda that enveloped Russia at the start of the 21st century. It was a world where politicians no longer cared whether they were caught lying; where old ideologies were dead and conspiracy thinking had become the new way to explain the world; where all the old political categories (socialist and liberal, conservative and communist) seemed utterly meaningless and it was unclear what political parties stood for; where warped nostalgia and vague emotive calls to \u201cRaise Russia From Its Knees\u201d had taken over from any rational idea of the future. In 2010, I came back to the UK because, in the words of my naive self, I wanted to live in a world where words had meaning. Sure the west was its own sort of mess, but politicians in Washington and Westminster still pretended to respect facts, sneered at conspiracy theories, tried to sound rational. Then came the revolutionary year of 2016 and ever since then I\u2019ve had the distinct deja vu that the same pathologies of public opinion I saw in Putinist Russia are now prevalent here. This is even reflected in one\u2019s personal life. Conspiracy theories had become so all-encompassing in noughties Russia that I found myself inching gently into conversations, feeling my way through to gently check whether my discussant thought all democracies were just run by cabals. Unlike the Soviet Union, the Putin regime was less obsessed with total ideological control and more on sowing polarisation within society, between what the Kremlin called the \u201cPutin majority\u201d (what they claimed were the \u201cordinary people\u201d) and everybody else, to undermine trust and a shared reality to the point where no coherent opposition could ever coalesce. As I write this from LA, I now find myself inching into conversations with similar caution \u2013 is my dinner party companion going to turn out to be a believer that Obama was a secret Muslim who wasn\u2019t born in the USA? Just as in Russia the temptation is to just tune out, to stop engaging with one another. When any political conversation risks leading to hyperpartisan hysteria, when the other side are categorised as traitors or fifth columnists, it\u2019s safer to talk about gardening instead. As we slip and stumble towards elections on both sides of the Atlantic, I can see the threat of the same mistakes that made 2016 so destructively polarising. We are in a race with a bunch of spin doctors whose techniques we now know, but are doing too little to counter. By we, I mean those who want to rescue a deliberative democracy where words have meaning, factuality is respected and communication across divides is possible. There are a few things we need to do urgently. First, make the internet interpretable and transparent. Part of the problem with the Brexit vote was that though it claims to represent \u201cthe people\u2019s will\u201d, because we don\u2019t know which highly targeted online messages were used to motivate people, we don\u2019t know why they voted.

I don\u2019t agree that Archer has had a better debut series. Cork was Man of the Match in both England victories, enabling them to draw 2-2 against a very strong West Indies side. He took a match-winning seven-for on debut at Lord\u2019s and a hat-trick in the first over of the final day at Old Trafford. The averages are a red herring, because that was a much higher-scoring series, and so are the number of wickets taken: Cork may have played five Tests but he only bowled in seven innings (plus five overs as the Trent Bridge Test drifted towards a draw).</p> <p>I wasn\u2019t for one minute suggesting Cork was better than Archer, who might already be the best England bowler I\u2019ve ever seen. But I think we forget the Boys Own impact Cork made in his first year of Test cricket, when he looked a superb, relentless swing bowler with a peculiar pant-splitting appeal.

He dances again at the next ball <strong>and hits him for six into the pavilion. </strong>Fantastic, assertive batting.

The World Cup and an Ashes series that hasn\u2019t once given us a three day result (well, without tempting fate, anyway). It\u2019s been a fantastic series, disappointing result but you can\u2019t have everything. I know we\u2019ve bemoaned the loss of Jimmy Anderson, but we\u2019ve found Jofra Archer and now that Sam Curran seems to have been released from revising for his GCSEs, we could well have two potential replacements for Jimmy and Stuart Broad.\u201d An excellent opening salvo.</p> <p>\u201cI only get to see the highlights, but from what I saw last night, it was good to see the crowd finally giving Steve Smith more cheers than boos. Booing was an ok reaction at first, then it was quite funny but it got really irritating after the third or fourth innings. The point had been made.\u201d Agreed.</p> <p>\u201cHe was astonishing and while I know the Aussie bowlers have been immense, England\u2019s bowlers haven\u2019t really let themselves down - if you give Smith the same average as the rest of his team mates, I\u2019m convinced there\u2019s a strong argument for England winning this series 3-1, he\u2019s been that outstanding. I mean, his 80 yesterday was the poorest score of the series? That\u2019s beyond phenomenal and into properly ridiculous.\u201d Yep.</p> <p>\u201cNow to a couple of questions that I\u2019ve never understood about the game. What\u2019s the thinking behind a nightwatchman? If you\u2019re sending someone who\u2019s not a recognised batsman out to face an attack geed up and ready for blood, surely there\u2019s a strong possibility that the nightwatchman won\u2019t last the night, giving the other side a fillip? And even if he does, he\u2019s surely an expected victim early on the following day, giving the other side another psychological boost that there\u2019s one more down cheaply?\u201d Absolutely, and you\u2019ve articulated perfectly why the Australian default (in other words the alpha approach) has long been to avoid them.</p> <p>\u201cAnd if there is a good argument for that, why did England send out both their regular openers last night? Isn\u2019t the argument for nightwatchmen valid there too? Send out one opener and a nightwatchman or even two nightwatchman?<br>I\u2019m not trying to be sarcastic or snide here, I\u2019m asking out of genuine ignorance.\u201d These are (valid) questions for men and women on a higher pay grade than I.</p> <p>\u201cNext, Denly survived an LBW shout because the ball pitched outside the line - I\u2019ve seen any number of LBWs that have pitched outside the line, but they\u2019ve been given. Again, genuine ignorance of the rules, here.

There is now the real prospect of England salvaging a draw from the series and maintaining their five-year unbeaten record on home soil.<br></p> <p>Jofra Archer was England\u2019s star, proving once again that when he is on song he is among the most dangerous bowlers in the world. The challenge for England\u2019s strategists is to ensure the all-format weapon is physically capable of hitting that sort of form regularly, and for Joe Root (or someone in England\u2019s party) to become <a href=\"https://youtu.be/i5_FR8i6Rss\">an Archer whisperer</a> and understand how to coax out those game-changing spells on matchday. <br></p> <p>But as much as Archer\u2019s six-for dominates the scorebook, the hustle of Sam Curran should not be overlooked. The Surrey allrounder provided some welcome variation to England\u2019s attack with his left-armers but it was his infectious enthusiasm that shone. Diminutive and babyfaced Curran resembled an eager puppy learning how to bare his teeth in sibling combat, but it was long overdue aggression, especially to Steve Smith. It\u2019s a shame Curran has been the only newcomer on display in south London with his youthful exuberance restoring some pep to a line-up that looked weary at Old Trafford. <br></p> <p>Speaking of Smith, he continued his extraordinary summer with another half-century (natch), but it is a measure of his mind boggling form that 80 is now considered something of a failure. Once again the rest of Australia\u2019s top order struggled, ramming home the point that this series will rightly be remembered as one of the all-time great individual performances. </p> <p>If you don\u2019t know the drill by now, I\u2019m around for an hour or so but when play begins Adam Collins will take over.

      "bodyText": "Vic\u2019s report. Barney Ronay on a hunch Denly on his future Ali Martin on Stokes 91st over: England 313-8 (Archer 3, Leach 5) Leach does extremely well to deal with a vicious throat ball from Cummins, gloving it well short of gully, and later in the over he fends another short ball just wide of the brilliant Bancroft at short leg. That\u2019s the end of another entertaining day\u2019s play. England will resume tomorrow with a lead of 382. It should be enough. Should. 90th over: England 311-8 (Archer 2, Leach 4) Labusachagne into the attack; a maiden to Leach. We\u2019ll have time for one more over. 89th over: England 311-8 (Archer 2, Leach 4) Leach gets off the mark with a fine stroke, driving Cummins through mid-on for three. A chant of \u201cstand up if you love Jack Leach\u201d goes round the ground, and a single off the last ball takes England\u2019s lead to 380. 88th over: England 305-8 (Archer 0, Leach 0) England lead by 374. Steve Smith couldn\u2019t, could he? (Clue: yes, of course he bloody could.) Two in two balls! Buttler top-edges a pull towards deep square leg, where Labuschagne charges in and dives forward to take a brilliant low catch. 87th over: England 305-7 (Buttler 47, Archer 0) \u201cMy advice, Rob, is to stop typing with your elbow,\u201d says Mac Millings. \u201cOr at least try the other one for a while.\u201d Steve Smith takes a spectacular catch! Woakes edged a big drive off Marsh that flew to the right of second slip, where Smith dived full-length to take a blinding one-handed catch. And then he got up and underarmed the ball away like it was the most routine catch in the world. The man\u2019s an absolute animal. 86th over: England 304-6 (Buttler 46, Woakes 6) There are nine overs remaining today, although I doubt we\u2019ll get them all before the 6.30pm finish. Peter Siddle returns to the attack and is hooked for a single by Buttler. It\u2019s all very low-key. \u201c2033,\u201d growls Matt Dony. \u201cThe Independent Kingdom of Scotland XI travel through the smouldering wasteland of post-B****t England to play a Test match against New Wales. Smyth runs an OBO from a bunker deep underground, watching on a grainy black and white CRT television, last bastion of the Mainstream Media. We cheer when we\u2019re told to cheer. Smith is still batting.\u201d 85th over: England 303-6 (Buttler 45, Woakes 6) Apologies for the brief updates. My elbow has become really sore in the last half hour and it bloomin\u2019 hurts to type. See, this is what a packed schedule does to people! 84th over: England 300-6 (Buttler 44, Woakes 5) Four more to Buttler, nailed through the covers off Hazlewood. He\u2019s probably done enough in the last two Tests to keep his place for the winter, and an edge for four moves him close to his second fifty of the game. 83rd over: England 290-6 (Buttler 35, Woakes 4) Buttler, who is playing beautifully at the moment, drives Cummins emphatically for four. He is ending a poor series in good spirits: his scores in the last two Tests have been 41, 34, 70 and 35*. \u201cRe: Simon McMahon\u2019s fears,\u201d begins Geoff Wignall. \u201cBy 2033 most likely the game will only be playable and night, when the temperatures drop to the mid-30s.\u201d 82nd over: England 286-6 (Buttler 31, Woakes 4) Woakes is beaten, fencing at a lovely lifter from Hazlewood. He and Cummins have bowled gloriously throughout this series, taking 48 wickets at an average of 20 between them. \u201cPeople who think they know the slightest, slimmest thing about cricket should be made to google research for two whole days without rest the story of Learie Constantine, especially his career and life in Nelson,\u201d says Romeo. \u201cBeyond a Boundary should be on every school syllabus. Every year.\u201d 81st over: England 283-6 (Buttler 27, Woakes 4) Woakes flicks his first ball to fine leg for four. Pat Cummins strikes in the first over with the second new ball. Curran, jumping across his stumps, flicks a full ball down the leg side and is superbly caught by the diving Paine. Australia still have an outside chance here. England lead by 348. 80th over: England 277-5 (Buttler 27, Curran 16) Lyon bowls what should be the last over with the old ball. One from it; England lead by 346. \u201cI dread to think,\u201d says Simon McMahon, \u201cwhat might happen in the next 14 years if we\u2019re all here in 2033 reminiscing about this summer and how things were simpler in 2019...\u201d 79th over: England 275-5 (Buttler 26, Curran 15) Curran gets his first boundary, smoking a wide half-volley from Marsh through the covers. The next ball flies off the edge for four more, well wide of Bancroft in the gully. A beautifully placed flick from Buttler brings three more, with the admirable Cummins going above and beyond to save the boundary. Fourteen from the over. 78th over: England 261-5 (Buttler 23, Curran 4) \u201cRob,\u201d says John Starbuck. \u201cIt\u2019s all very well to celebrate 2005, but 1981, Headingley onwards, was much better, because we were raised by cricket from the depths of despair at ever being likely to match Australia. That also brought a very welcome distraction from the Royal Wedding and the riots in several cities. Ghost Town by the Specials was number one, followed by Green Door by Shakin\u2019 Stevens.\u201d I was five years old, which is why it doesn\u2019t mean as much to me, but I wouldn\u2019t call you a fool. There\u2019s a really enjoyable film on that summer, From the Ashes I think it\u2019s called. 77th over: England 259-5 (Buttler 22, Curran 3) It\u2019s all a bit quiet out there, with both teams conscious that the second new ball will be available in a few overs. An absent-minded defensive stroke from Buttler almost goes back onto the stumps; the next ball is thick edged for a single. 76th over: England 258-5 (Buttler 21, Curran 3) Curran, who has started scratchily, is beaten by a good delivery from Lyon. A maiden. 75th over: England 258-5 (Buttler 21, Curran 3) Curran is beaten by consecutive deliveries from Marsh. A single off the final ball takes England\u2019s lead to a healthy 327. \u201cI seem to remember as a young boy (born 1931) sitting on what I recalled as splintery park benches at Old Trafford but could not really believe my memories of the seating could be right, now someone in the commentary mentioned it so I was right after all,\u201d says Peter Vernon. \u201cOh, what memories, Cyril Washbrook, Learie Constantine many other \u2018greats\u2019, such wonderful days. I wonder if I was playing hooky off school.\u201d I so wish I\u2019d seen Learie Constantine. If ever there was a player who shouldn\u2019t be judged by statistics. 74th over: England 256-5 (Buttler 20, Curran 2) Lyon returns to the attack; Buttler drives him gloriously for four through extra cover. He\u2019s ending a largely miserable series in fine form, although he does survive a good LBW shout from Lyon after pushing around a sharply spinning delivery. I suspect height saved him ... but replays show he would have been out on review! That\u2019s the second time today that Australia have declined to review a decision that would have been overturned. 73rd over: England 251-5 (Buttler 15, Curran 2) Bairstow ends a disappointing series with 214 runs at 23.77. In his last 30 Tests he averages 29, and it\u2019s probably time for a winter off. \u201cAh it was a different time, 2005,\u201d says Guy Hornsby. \u201cIt felt like anything was possible. Every day was sunny, the pubs were overspilling with cricket fans, beer was cheap, Freddie was wobbling around Downing Street, I bet there was there was an absolute belter at the top of the charts. Oh.\u201d Demon Days by Gorillaz was the soundtrack of that particular summer, at least in my world, and what other world is there. Yep, that\u2019s out. It was a lovely low catch from Smith after Bairstow edged the new bowler Marsh to first slip. Bairstow is taken by Smith at first slip - but did it carry? They are going to check; the soft signal is out. 72nd over: England 249-4 (Bairstow 14, Buttler 15) \u201cA very similar situation re: Denly happened here in Toronto,\u201d says Glen Crisp. Long story short: Fred Van Vleet was playing badly for the Raptors in the NBA playoffs. His wife gave birth and \u2018FVV\u2019 played on no sleep and went on to have the playoffs of his life. Many lines of print were spent wondering if the magic of childbirth was the reason. There may be something to it. Here\u2019s a good link summarising things.\u201d 71st over: England 247-4 (Bairstow 14, Buttler 13) Pat Cummins also returns to the attack, so Tim Paine really is going for it. Bairstow, back in his crease, cracks his first ball superbly through the covers for four - and he does the same to the last delivery. These two look in the mood to punish Australia tonight. 70th over: England 239-4 (Bairstow 6, Buttler 13) Josh Hazlewood returns to the attack. Australia aren\u2019t quite out of this game, not with Steve Smith in their side, but they need to finish England off in a hurry. He almost picks up Buttler, who is beaten trying to drive off the back foot. \u201cI was just about to email in with memories of watching Clive Radley make that old man\u2019s ton when I thought I\u2019d better check the details,\u201d says Gary Naylor. \u201cTurns out the 15-year-old me was sitting on Old Trafford\u2019s splintery park benches for an ODI century - but, hey kids, played in whites with a red ball. One wonders just how often the memory played tricks before the internet came along with its irrefutable (well, irrefutablish) truths.\u201d 69th over: England 237-4 (Bairstow 6, Buttler 11) Buttler gets going with boundaries off his second and third balls. The first was a luscious back-foot drive; the second was a check drive that just evaded Siddle, who tried to take the catch in his follow through, before racing down the ground. A clip off the pads for three takes him to 11 from five balls, and then Bairstow scrunches a drive behind square for four. Fifteen from the over! \u201cAs someone who has stood as umpire in more than a couple of \u2018friendly\u2019 games, I was often the recipient of the considered opinions of players regarding the (potential) decision on a dismissal or such like,\u201d says Mark Slater. \u201cIt would have been helpful, I am sure, if it was not that the advice of the fielding side was flatly contradicted by the batsmen. I had to revert to what I was pleased to call my own judgement.\u201d 68th over: England 222-4 (Bairstow 2, Buttler 0) \u201cAh 2005,\u201d weeps Ian Copestake. \u201cArdent OBO bonding over Freddie and flamingo shots. Perhaps the last island of beauty ... until Stokes and Leach and Archer.\u201d 67th over: England 222-4 (Bairstow 2, Buttler 0) Joe Denly ends the series with 312 runs at 31.20. All things considered, that\u2019s an admirable effort. Joe Denly falls six short of a maiden Test century, but there wasn\u2019t much he could do in the face of some brilliant bowling from Siddle. After almost falling to a couple of big reverse inswingers - one brought an LBW appeal, one bounced over middle stump - Denly edged a lovely outswinger to Smith at slip. That was masterful bowling. Ach, that\u2019s such a shame. 66th over: England 218-3 (Denly 94, Bairstow 2) Bairstow shapes to sweep Lyon, realises it\u2019s a bit wide and adjusts his wrists to steer a late cut for two. Modern batsmen are obscenely talented. \u201cGreetings from Brean Sands, the golden sanded jewel of the Severn Estuary,\u201d says Brian Withington. \u201cJust reflecting that each run England score now brings Steve Smith ever closer to the chance of Ashes immortality. Who amongst us could possibly begrudge him scoring 250 odd chasing down 450? Form a small embittered queue behind me on the dunes.\u201d Indeed. He\u2019s never batted against England in a successful run-chase, and he seems to have a particular distaste for unfinished business. 65th over: England 216-3 (Denly 94, Bairstow 0) Denly flashes at Siddle, inside-edging the ball just past leg stump. Careful, Joseph. \u201cObviously, 2005 was absolutely magnificent, but it gets slightly lost in my memory, lumped in with a Welsh Grand Slam and a certain football match in Turkey,\u201d says Matt Dony. \u201cAnd my wedding. (It\u2019s an easy year to remember...) I wasn\u2019t as scarred by 90\u2019s English cricket as many others, so the Ashes victory wasn\u2019t as redemptive. This year has been so much more focussed on the cricket, and I think I\u2019ve enjoyed it slightly more because of it. The World Cup was amazing; the final was one of the most astonishing games I\u2019ve ever seen. The Ashes have been, generally, thoroughly entertaining, even with the disappointment of seeing Australia retain the urn. Plus, Master Dony has started watching and asking about cricket, and Mrs Dony came to Sophia Gardens for the first time, and loved it. 2019. A good year.\u201d 64th over: England 214-3 (Denly 93, Bairstow 0) If he reaches three figures, Denly will be England\u2019s oldest maiden Test centurion since Clive Radley in 1978. Goodnight. That\u2019s an absolute beauty from Lyon, which drifts in and turns sharply to castle Stokes. There wasn\u2019t much Stokes could do, although he looks as frustrated as ever as he walks from the field. He\u2019s had his moments with the bat this summer. 63rd over: England 211-2 (Denly 90, Stokes 67) Denly steers Siddle for three to move into the nineties, and then Stokes slaps a couple of boundaries. This could be a miserable session for Australia if they don\u2019t pick up a couple of early wickets. England lead by 280. 62nd over: England 198-2 (Denly 87, Stokes 57) Denly drives the new bowler Lyon sweetly through mid-off for his 14th four. It will be a lovely story if he makes a century, and also a message to thirtysomething county batsmen that the door is never closed: Denly didn\u2019t play for England in any form of the game between February 2010 and October 2018. \u201cI can\u2019t remember another session this series which has been wicket-free,\u201d says Ian Forth. \u201cFunnily enough (for those who are taking notes) in the last 2-2 draw, back in \u201972, it wasn\u2019t until the final test at The Oval that there was a session in which a wicket didn\u2019t fall as well. Both Chappells got tons and Australia won.\u201d And then scared the hell out of world cricket for the next five years. 61st over: England 193-2 (Denly 82, Stokes 57) Here we go again. Peter Siddle starts after tea with a maiden to Ben Stokes. This might be Siddle\u2019s last Test \u2013 he turns 35 in November \u2013 and he\u2019ll not want to end wicketless. \u201cFunny how people seem to have decided that England are only winning because Australia are knackered,\u201d says Phil Harrison. \u201cWeren\u2019t we supposed to be giving that excuse short shrift in relation to England earlier in the summer? Australia are mainly losing this game because they picked the wrong team and made a howler at the toss. And given that they had the better of the draw at Lord\u2019s, England are good value for a draw in this series.\u201d Teatime reading This, from Daniel Harris, is a textbook example of smart, original, ardent sports writing. And it includes a love letter to the marvellous Wayne Mardle. \u201cAfternoon Rob,\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cWhen all\u2019s said and done after this Test, it\u2019s been a wonderful summer of cricket. One that won\u2019t be forgotten for a long time. Highlight? For England fans, the World Cup final, Stokes at Headingley and the emergence of Archer take some beating, Australia have the Ashes and a 21st century Bradman. And we all have Kane Williamson and Virat Kohli.\u201d Nothing will ever top 2005 but this has easily been the most enjoyable - and professionally stressful - summer of cricket since then. In a weird way, my favourite game was that group-stage win over India. I thought England were gone, yet they played with such courage and skill against the most intimidating team in the competition. 60th over: England 193-2 (Denly 82, Stokes 57) Labuschagne\u2019s final over before tea passes without incident. It was a superb session for England, who scored 105 runs without losing a wicket. Joe Denly is 18 away from a first Test century, and Ben Stokes looks in the mood for a third hundred of the series. 59th over: England 192-2 (Denly 82, Stokes 56) Denly moves into the eighties with a cover-driven four off Siddle. This could be a life-changing innings. Few people thought he\u2019d survive this Ashes series, but now he has a great chance to become a regular for the next two or three years. 58th over: England 187-2 (Denly 78, Stokes 55) Stokes survives another LBW appeal from Labuschagne, this time after hiding his bat behind the pad. He was a long way down the pitch and it was missing leg. Labuschagne continues to mix jaffas and filth; Denly drives a full toss for four. Matthew Wade, meanwhile, is telling the umpires how to do their job, suggesting that the Stokes LBW appeal - which was missing leg anyway - has set a precedent for the rest of the game that it\u2019s okay to hide your bat behind the pad. 57th over: England 182-2 (Denly 74, Stokes 54) Siddle replaces Hazlewood, and promptly slips a good one past Denly\u2019s outside edge. Denly responds with a businesslike clip through square leg for four when Siddle drifts onto the pads; an eventful over concludes with a sincere edge that lands just short of the diving Paine. Hey Joe, c\u2019mon Joe: 26 more runs. \u201cAgree on Denly at 3: it\u2019s where he was picked to bat in the first place, of course,\u201d says Robert Ellson. \u201cHere\u2019s my first XI for the winter: Burns (c), Sibley, Denly, Root, Pope, Stokes, Buttler (wk), Archer, Leach, Broad, Anderson. Obviously the selectors will stick with Root as captain, but I\u2019d really like our world-class batsman back.\u201d The same. I think I\u2019d swap Pope and Stokes, and probably play Curran ahead of Broad or Anderson in New Zealand, but I certainly wouldn\u2019t misplace my rag on a digital platform if that was the XI for the first Test. 56th over: England 177-2 (Denly 70, Stokes 53) Yeehaw! Stokes whips a full toss from Labuschagne for six to reach another authoritative half-century. He almost falls soon after, though, gloving a nasty delivery just short of Bancroft at short leg. And he survives a run-out chance when Wade\u2019s throw from mid-on whistles past the stumps; Stokes would have been gone with a direct hit. England lead by 246. \u201cWhisper it, but Australia look a little like England did in the days before General Fletcher and Colonel Hussain cajoled, coerced and commanded them into a competent and then brilliant team,\u201d says Gary Naylor. \u201cThe fielding is scrappy, the decision-making muddled, the bowling uninspired - the game is drifting, which suits England all day long. The crowd are paying handsomely for their seats (and for a beer and bite on the concourse) and they deserve more than what\u2019s been served up in this match. And for that, they should blame the administrators and not the players, who are neither robots nor performing fleas able to jump on demand. The schedule has crushed the spirits of even the fittest and finest and devalues Test cricket.\u201d The schedule has been a borderline disgrace for at least a decade. There have been so many warnings, almost all of them ignored. 55th over: England 170-2 (Denly 70, Stokes 46) Denly mistimes a pull off Hazlewood for a single, which makes this his highest Test score, before Stokes cuts crisply for three. Thanks, meanwhile, to Malcolm Barnard for sending this Molesworth picture, as requested by John Starbuck during the lunch break. 54th over: England 165-2 (Denly 69, Stokes 42) Stokes is beaten through the gate by a ripper from Labuschagne that just bounces over the stumps. For an occasional spinner, he bowls some cracking deliveries. Denly survives a potential run-out chance later in the over after a poor throw from Wade at mid-on. I think Denly would have made it, even with a direct hit. Wade probably went to the wrong end, because Stokes was struggling as he charged towards the non-striker\u2019s end. 53rd over: England 160-2 (Denly 68, Stokes 40) Joe Denly has quietly had a decent series, and deserves to keep his place for the New Zealand tour. I\u2019d love to see him at No3, with Dominic Sibley opening alongside Rory Burns. It\u2019s not quite Strauss/Cook/Trott, but they share one vital quality with that 2010-11 top three: the ability and willingness to bat time. 52nd over: England 160-2 (Denly 68, Stokes 40) This is now the most productive Test series of Stokes\u2019 career - he\u2019s made 414 runs, three more than in South Africa in 2015-16. He survives another appeal, this time for a bat-pad catch off Labuschagne after missing a reverse sweep. 51st over: England 158-2 (Denly 67, Stokes 39) Hazlewood, on for Marsh, has a big shout for LBW against Stokes turned down. There\u2019s no review, but that looked close. It was slightly hard to appraise, because Stokes was on the walk when the ball hit him on the pad as he flicked across the line. Replays show it was missing off stump. England lead by 227. \u201cEven more respect to that dude Kim Thonger,\u201d says Brian Withington. \u201cI loved Bill &amp; Ted\u2019s Seventh Seal homage to Bergman with them playing Twister with Death (I guess in the sequel). Like young Curran wrestling with Steve Smith to avoid the inevitable.\u201d 50th over: England 155-2 (Denly 67, Stokes 36) Marnus Labuschagne replaces Nathan Lyon, starting with an eventful over to Joe Denly. He turns a boundary off the pads, checks a drive just wide of the diving Labuschagne and finally mistimes a lofted drive that just clears the leaping Marsh at mid-off before racing away for four. 49th over: England 147-2 (lead by 216; Denly 59, Stokes 36) That\u2019s a nice stroke from Denly, who cuts Marsh for four more. He\u2019s 41 runs away from a maiden Test century, two days after the birth of his second child. Who writes your scripts, Joe? Meanwhile, a quick note on the Cork v Archer discussion from earlier, when I was gently belittled by John Cox. I don\u2019t agree that Archer has had a better debut series. Cork was Man of the Match in both England victories, enabling them to draw 2-2 against a very strong West Indies side. He took a match-winning seven-for on debut at Lord\u2019s and a hat-trick in the first over of the final day at Old Trafford. The averages are a red herring, because that was a much higher-scoring series, and so are the number of wickets taken: Cork may have played five Tests but he only bowled in seven innings (plus five overs as the Trent Bridge Test drifted towards a draw). I wasn\u2019t for one minute suggesting Cork was better than Archer, who might already be the best England bowler I\u2019ve ever seen. But I think we forget the Boys Own impact Cork made in his first year of Test cricket, when he looked a superb, relentless swing bowler with a peculiar pant-splitting appeal. His influence on that series was greater than Archer\u2019s on this, in my opinion, although a second-innings ten-for might change that. 48th over: England 141-2 (Denly 54, Stokes 35) In Test cricket, Stokes has batted everywhere from Nos3-11. I wonder where he\u2019ll settle over the next few years. No5 feels about right, ideally with Root at No4 and maybe Pope at No6. 47th over: England 140-2 (Denly 54, Stokes 34) Stokes, England\u2019s batsman of the series, moves into the thirties by steering Marsh past backward point for four. In other news, that was a bad non-review from Australia a couple of overs ago, because it looked pretty clear that the worst-case scenario was umpire\u2019s call. Anyway, Denly survived. \u201cI see Aggers is looking forward to Jofra bowling on the hard pitches down under,\u201d says Bill Hargreaves. \u201cOn the subject of fast bowlers, one that I\u2019ve heard an enormous amount about - but have failed to find either footage or articles on - is Lillian Thomson. Complete blank on Google. Can anyone fill me in, please?\u201d Yeah, she played alongside Evelyn Waugh back in the day. Thanks Adam, hello everyone. England are pottering towards what should be a matchwinning lead. They are 208 ahead, with plenty of batting to come. 46th over: England 135-2 (Denly 54, Stokes 29) Lyon sends down the final over before drinks, Stokes tucking one off his pads, Denly doing the rest. Being the halfway mark of the day, it\u2019s time for me to hand the baton to Rob Smyth, who will see you through to stumps. Bye! 45th over: England 134-2 (Denly 54, Stokes 28) Marsh is back on to dry things up. This isn\u2019t a good sign for Siddle, who has been called upon for just four of the 44 overs sent down so far in this second innings. He\u2019s where he needs to be at Stokes, pushing and missing right away. Marsh is convinced he has Denly leg before to finish but Umpire Erasmus turns it down and Paine doesn\u2019t review. Looked a pretty good shout, too. Technology says it was out! Well, well... 44th over: England 133-2 (Denly 54, Stokes 27) Stokes is getting busy now, advancing the lead beyond 200 with a four then a six from consecutive balls. The first came courtesy of a rare Labuschagne misfield but the second was brilliant - a hard, flat sweep. Shot. 43rd over: England 122-2 (Denly 54, Stokes 16) After waiting and leaving and waiting and leaving, Stokes picks his moment to drive Hazlewood through cover, adding three. Both then pull singles to finish. A productive over, the lead for the home side is now 191. \u201cAdam,\u201d replies Kim Thonger. \u201cPlease do tell the wholly remarkable Brian Withington I\u2019m grateful for his kind words. He\u2019s reminded me that it\u2019s 30 years since Bill &amp; Ted\u2019s Excellent Adventure found its way into my VHS recorder, (and I don\u2019t mean Bill Edrich and Ted Dexter, for the avoidance of doubt).\u201d 42nd over: England 116-2 (Denly 53, Stokes 12) That\u2019s Lyon\u2019s spell done for the time being, leaving the ground at the end of the over to get his spinning finger looked at again. He split the skin on it at Manchester last week. They were very chatty to Stokes around the bat before he got off strike with a sweep for three. Interesting. 41st over: England 113-2 (Denly 53, Stokes 9) Hazlewood beats Stokes to begin, working across his body. The ball isn\u2019t that old, of course. There\u2019s still enough there for the quicks - there certainly was for Marsh on Thursday. In response, the left-hander leaves the rest in that vicinity, happy taking a single to long leg when on offer. \u201cHow many of my teams can lose in one weekend?\u201d asks Peter McNaughton. \u201cAustralia lost to Spain in the basketball and the Lions lost to GWS, Newcastle United are down 2-1 to Liverpool and this English lead is starting to climb. Surely one win from four isn\u2019t too much to ask?\u201d I\u2019m sure all Australian readers will all share your Boomers pain. Many of us in the press box spent the first 15 minutes watching the dramatic finish of that rather than the cricket yesterday. Sigh. 40th over: England 112-2 (Denly 53, Stokes 8) Stokes gives the strike back to Denly with a single to long-off, the opener now more watchful against Lyon. He\u2019s getting more turn by the over. \u201cAs a wee lad,\u201d writes Philip Sutherland, \u201cI used to watch Surrey from time to time. Heady days: Edrich, Edwards, Mickey Stewart, Roope, Intikarb Alam, Pocock, Long, Arnold, Jackman and Storey (yes, long time ago) spring immediately to mind so always love The Oval Test. Thank you for your commentary.\u201d Thanks for your company. It\u2019s heresy to say this as a Melburnian, but I think this is my favourite Test ground. At least in the semi-finals. 39th over: England 111-2 (Denly 53, Stokes 7) That\u2019s a great way for Denly to raise his half-century, clipping Hazlewood through square leg for an attactive boundary. The Oval faithful are standing in applause, acknowledging his fourth Test half-century. Talking to him before this match, the Kent veteran never thought this was going to happen for him as of a couple of seasons ago. A nice story. A tweet from Ian Anderson in reply to John Stabuck at lunch. 38th over: England 105-2 (Denly 47, Stokes 7) Smith has put Stokes down at slip! It was a tough chance, flying off the bat from the back foot. He got his hands there in time but it was in and out. Earlier in the over, the left-hander took it to the spinner as Denly did to begin the day, coming down and smacking him over his head for four. 37th over: England 101-2 (Denly 47, Stokes 3) The England 100 is up, Denly pushing Cummins into the legside for one. That makes the lead 169 - nice and healthy. Stokes breaks with the trend of late and takes on a bouncer later in the over, nearly picking out deep backward square. Back to Plan A here, I reckon, fellas. 36th over: England 99-2 (Denly 46, Stokes 2) Denly is most chilled out at the moment, patting Lyon\u2019s offerings back to him until ready to push a single down the ground. I\u2019ve had a listen to the Gower audio on a colleague\u2019s computer and it\u2019s quite funny. Here you go. 35th over: England 98-2 (Denly 45, Stokes 2) They are working to a plan with Cummins, seeing him out of the attack without any risks, surely mindful of the work he has in his legs of late. Denly keeps the strike, helping a short ball on its way for a single. More on Wade on Richard McConnell. \u201cMassive fan of Wade exuding that trademark \u201cElite Honesty\u201d and mouthing off. Off the back of a very middling series, he demonstrates a streak of self-confidence that most folk would die for.\u201d Some Stokes/Warner chat at the lunch break as well, so twitter tells me. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll read more about that by the close. David Gower had a bit of a hot-mic moment too, I\u2019m told. All the fun of the fair. 34th over: England 97-2 (Denly 44, Stokes 2) I\u2019m going to mozz him here, but I reckon this is the day Denly gets to 100. His 44th of those comes through a clip to midwicket, handling Lyon really well. \u201cThought for day,\u201d from Nicholas Walmsley. \u201cMaybe Wade owes his selection in large part to his facial hair? There was always a strong correlation between hirsute Aussies and the position of Yapper-in-Chief: Lillee, Marsh, Hughes, Border, Boon \u2026 although it started to tail off in the late 90s. Johnson, of course, had a spectacular muzzie, but this current Aussie crew (Wade aside) are a disturbingly clean-shaven bunch. They need another Ocker or two, then they\u2019ll be world beaters.\u201d Decent theory - correlation/causation, I wonder? They still grow it when visiting the subcontinent; an Australians-on-tour tradition. 33rd over: England 96-2 (Denly 43, Stokes 2) Cummins is trying to tempt Stokes from over the wicket but the left-hander wants nothing of it, a satisfied observer shouldering arms. For now, at least. \u201cI read an article written by your colleague Emma John on the retirement of David Gower from the Sky commentary team,\u201d reports Nick Bimson. \u201cTucked away in this article was a delicious paragraph on the excellency of Nasser Hussain\u2019s and Mike Atherton\u2019s analytic skills and a consequent call for the pair to be awarded a spin-off crime show. Inspired by this prospect, my friend and I began generating potential titles for an appropriately pulpy serial blending morally ambiguous hardboiled machismo with cerebral continental flair; think Double Indemnity with generous dollops of Hercule Poirot. The current fruits of our creative partnership include: Athers and Nass: Trial by Spin Athers and Nass: Seams like Murder Athers and Nass: Outside the Line of Enquiry Athers and Nass: Death of an Innings.\u201d 32nd over: England 96-2 (Denly 43, Stokes 2) Lyon it is from the end where he picked up Root before lunch. Stokes watches the first few carefully before pushing to cover for one. It was Denly who went after him from the outset this morning and he\u2019s of that mind again, coming down but failing to make good contact this time. He gets a couple down the ground but wasn\u2019t in complete control. Still, it remains a good plan to mess with the tweaker\u2019s confidence. 31st over: England 93-2 (Denly 41, Stokes 1) Top bowling Cummins right away to start the session, punctuated by a perfect leg-cutter to Denly, beating him a treat outside his off-stump. But the opener has shown through this series that he doesn\u2019t lose his concentration after copping a good one, leaning on a lovely cover drive to finish the over. The players are back on the field. Stokes is at the business end. He\u2019ll be facing Pat Cummins from the Pavilion End. Walking past the team as they set up, Ricky Ponting was offering some thoughts. If I\u2019m reading the body language correctly, I think Smith was suggesting to him that it\u2019ll be Lyon on next from the Vauxhall End. PLAY! \u201cOla Adam.\u201d Hello, Geoff Wignall. \u201cAustralia need to be careful here - unless they allow England a lead of around 400, Smith\u2019s unlikely to have the opportunity for taking Bradman\u2019s record whilst winning this match.\u201d I\u2019ll take the 905. There are a lot of numbers still left. \u201cPlease pass on my very best to the excellent Kim Thonger,\u201d relays Brian Withington. \u201cI feel almost guilty for hoping that Ravi &amp; co can preserve the long accustomed (and clearly comfortable) Somerset vibe at Taunton in two weeks time. Almost.\u201d I wonder if Pete Siddle will be available? Some shirt numerology from Smylers. \u201cThe least-droppable members of the England team are probably Joe Root, Jofra Archer, Ben Stokes, and Jack Leach \u2014 whose shirt numbers are 66, 22, 55, and 77. So maybe any new player getting a call-up for the next tour would fare best by picking one of the remaining repeating-digit squad numbers? Perhaps 33, which has worked out pretty well for Marnus Labuschagne.\u201d In Australia, we have a cabinet minister who added an \u2018S\u2019 to her name because of numerology. You couldn\u2019t make it up. More along those very good lines from Paul Jarvis: \u201cG\u2019day Adam from misty Scotland. Anyone notice when Stokes came in just now that his runs scored were 3526 and his average was... 35.26? It jus goes to show... something.\u201d \u201cJust wondering what a realistic run chase would be for Australia?\u201d asks Martin Gillam. The question probably becomes do they have someone who can take it deep with Smith. No more than 300. \u201cCan I be the first (and hopefully only) one to comment that nasty people might say that Denly\u2019s being hit where it hurts might be thought of as appropriate in view of the birth of his second child - overpopulation and all that,\u201d jokes Rob Lewis. \u201cFather of four.\u201d \u201cThe prospect of a \u2018punchy\u2019 2nd innings ton from Warner might indeed be \u2018tasty to write about\u2019, demonstrating your admirable journalistic bent before any patriotic considerations,\u201d says Brian Withington. Why, thank you. \u201cHowever, from a Brexit-riddled English supporter\u2019s perspective it could well leave me plucking out my eyes and thus missing the arrival of the other three horsemen of the apocalypse.\u201d Nice imagery. Don\u2019t worry, it won\u2019t happen. \u201cSeeing Pete Salmon use the term Old Skool immediately evoked the cartoon of Molesworth, in typically scruffy cricket gear, standing in the outfield and musing \u2018and it could all be ended in a minute\u2019 while the ball is about to descend on his head,\u201d according to John Starbuck. \u201cI can\u2019t find the drawing online but someone else might be able to, though any fule know that.\u201d A pretty good session for England. It would have been a very good one had Root made it through to the interval but their lead is building solidly and the Australian attack are having to work hard in superb batting conditions. Can they do it again and punish Australia with a day in the dirt? We\u2019ll find out after lunch. I\u2019ll be back in about 15 minutes to race through some more emails. Drop me a line. 30th over: England 88-2 (Denly 37, Stokes o) Stokes gets off strike from the first ball of Lyon\u2019s over via a leg bye behind square. The spinner stays around the wicket to Denly, playing it out defensively, all on the front foot. He\u2019s earned his sandwich. LUNCH! As they leave the field, Paine puts his arm around Erasmus. They were trying to sneak the extra over in but didn\u2019t make it before 1pm. 29th over: England 87-2 (Denly 37, Stokes o) Three maidens on the bounce for Australia, something they have struggled to achieve in this Test with the exception of when Marsh and Cummins were operating together after tea on day one, prompting that run of wickets. Marsh, now moved to the pavilion end, has started well, and Denly has nearly got himself through to lunch. One to come. \u201cBeing the Oval and being the Ashes, who will reprise the roles of Brett Lee and Kevin Pietersen from 2005?\u201d asks Boris Starling... a tad optimistically, I\u2019d suggest! \u201cIt\u2019s still one of the most astonishing innings I\u2019ve ever seen, particularly that passage of play with Lee bowling faster and faster and Pietersen hitting him harder and harder - such ridiculous hand speed with the bat, and his eyes so focussed it was as though he were in a trance.\u201d He wants Cummins v Stokes, which will be coming up after this lunch break. 28th over: England 87-2 (Denly 37, Stokes o) That\u2019s big for Lyon. Yes, he already had a wicket today but it wasn\u2019t a pretty one. This was, though. Picking up the England captain ten minutes before lunch, no less. That feels good. Good captaincy from Paine too, moving him to the Vauxhall End, where he hadn\u2019t yet bowled from in the Test. Romeo is very cross that commentators are saying that Labuachagne has been \u2018discovered\u2019 in this series despite playing for Australia last summer and making lots of runs for Glamorgan. \u201cWhether he\u2019s South African or Australian is irrelevant because he\u2019s actually Welsh. He\u2019s been legally adopted and his surname is now Llabwschagne.\u201d Lyon has two! Root played for turn that wasn\u2019t there, edging the overspinner to Smith at slip who makes no mistake. 27th over: England 87-1 (Denly 37, Root 21) Siddle gets through a dry maiden to Denly. That\u2019s what they want from him. 26th over: England 87-1 (Denly 37, Root 21) Marsh doesn\u2019t get it going quite so much this time around, the set pair exchanging singles square of the wicket before the captain ends the over with a solid push through cover for two. They\u2019ll get four more in before lunch. \u201cI\u2019m looking at my hands here and I don\u2019t see how you can even get seven stitches in the webbing between two of your fingers,\u201d Ben Mimmack observes. \u201cAre Marcus Harris\u2019 hands shaped like a frog\u2019s foot or something? Maybe that\u2019s why I never made it as a top level cricketer.\u201d Rule of thumb (so to speak): ALL cricketers have huge hands. Even the small ones. That\u2019s all I\u2019ve got for you on this topic. 25th over: England 83-1 (Denly 36, Root 18) Siddle is back now too, the Cummins/Hazlewood duo rested before the interval. Denly gets a bit of width from the first change and uses it well, steering behind point for four. It\u2019s a pretty good return to the crease though, twice finding the inside edge with probing deliveries then, you guessed it, whacking the opener in the box again. It was well timed as Denly\u2019s earlier blow there had prompted a full montage of sorts on Sky of the times Root has found it funny when others have suffered. Naturally, it is followed by the David Lloyd incident. \u201cStraight in the nads!\u201d he says. Okay - I laughed. I can\u2019t help it. \u201cCan I just point out to Brian Withington that nobody can truly understand REAL pessimism until they\u2019ve supported Somerset CCC for a few decades,\u201d notes Kim Thonger. \u201cEvery time we\u2019ve had a sniff of the county championship it\u2019s been whisked away from under our noses. It\u2019s not a glass half empty feeling, it\u2019s an empty glass vaporised in a nuclear conflagration feeling.\u201d This time, though? 24th over: England 79-1 (Denly 32, Root 18) Root\u2019s best shot so far this morning, taking Mitch Marsh\u2019s second ball through square leg for a beautifully timed boundary. Australia\u2019s new swing ace gets the ball hooping later in the over though, beating the outside edge by a long way. He\u2019s asking questions with the last ball too, Root keeping one out going the other way off the seam. An encouraging start. 23rd over: England 75-1 (Denly 32, Root 14) They like the Cummins v Root contest but the England captain keeps getting off strike early in the over against him. He gets another ball to jag back at the groin of Denly as he did in his previous, this time clipping the inside edge and running down to the rope. Lucky for the opener on two fronts. 22nd over: England 70-1 (Denly 28, Root 13) After the delay for Denly to compose himself, Root edges the first ball from Hazlewood to slip. It\u2019s a genuine edge - his hands weren\u2019t soft - it just doesn\u2019t carry. Back on strike, Denly defends Hazlewood with confidence. \u201cIs that why Wade\u2019s in the side then?\u201d asks David Seats. \u201cThe chirp?\u201d I didn\u2019t see the incident in question after the drinks break when racing back from the gents, but I assume he was called up by the umps for being a naughty boy again? A bit of that last night, too. 21st over: England 67-1 (Denly 28, Root 10) Oooh, another delivery into the box. Have more helmets or boxes been hit in this series? A lot of both, that\u2019s for sure. Denly is down for a long time too, the medical staff coming out to keep him company. He had handled the Cummins over well to that point, defending solidly then pushing Australia\u2019s numero uno through cover for a couple. Count \u2018em. \u201cQuick word about the keeping of Paine this series,\u201d begins Pete Salmon. \u201cBeen a real pleasure to watch an Old Skool keeper ply his trade. Athletic takes done with minimum fuss, and that catch \u2013 stayed low, took easily. A quiet masterclass.\u201d I didn\u2019t give enough credit there, did I? He\u2019s very, very good. 20th over: England 65-1 (Denly 26, Root 10) Good shot, I think? Well executed, at least - Root uppercutting Hazlewood over the cordon. A fairly high risk profile on that early in his innings, I would have thought. As CricViz shows, he doesn\u2019t like letting many balls go. The captain gets two more along the carpet through cover - nice. Cummins and Hazlewood have bowled 15 of Australia\u2019s 20 overs. \u201cThe people here in Cape Town are worried that the England team are not good enough to survive three days at Newlands,\u201d laughs Trevor Tutu. \u201cThe problem is that we don\u2019t know when to have the spit-braai (whole-sheep kebab / barbecue). Will it be over by Friday or Saturday? The caterers have to know.\u201d Now, now... 19th over: England 59-1 (Denly 26, Root 4) Lyon is straight off as well, Paine turning to Cummins to replace him the over after the breakthrough. I get what he\u2019s trying to do, putting maximum pressure on Root before he\u2019s set, but there will be a limited number of times he can call on the two big quicks - they\u2019ve done a lot of work. Root gets himself off strike first ball of the second hour, pushing one to the right of point. Good batting. Denly does the sensible thing, absorbing the rest in defence and ducking. \u201cMorning Adam.\u201d Morning, Brian Withington. \u201cRegarding Steve Whitefield\u2019s lighter shade of pessimism, another 60 something England supporter could expect that the \u2018someone getting a century today\u2019 would be Steve Smith (but might dread it being Warner).\u201d A Warner second innings ton in a big chase? Hmmm, tasty to write about. Imagine his response to such an achievement? Punchy. 18th over: England 58-1 (Denly 26, Root 3) Interesting that Siddle has been taken off after just two overs, Hazlewood already back for a second spell this morning from the Vauxhall End. He\u2019s immediately landing them on that perfect length, Denly defending respectfully. \u201cGood morning Adam.\u201d Hi, John Davis. \u201cI assume Harris won\u2019t be able to open if he\u2019s off the field for the whole innings (coming in at 7, something tells me?). If so, who opens with Warner? I\u2019m guessing Labuschagne, with Smith at 3. It would be too easy to make a joke about that being one way to avoid being 20/2, so I\u2019ll definitely point it out before everyone else does.\u201d Because it is an external injury, Harris will be able to open. Whether he does or not is another question. Seven stitches to the hand sounds like... a lot? If he can\u2019t, Labuschagne probably will. DRINKS. 17th over: England 58-1 (Denly 26, Root 3) At least Root is coming in, as Warne says on TV, with England ahead of the game for once with their lead already 123. He\u2019s off the mark first ball, turning Lyon into the leg side for a couple. He gets another in that direction, Denly then finishing the successful over with one behind square. That wicket really was against the flow of play. Burns will be filthy. Ohh, and he\u2019s thrown it away. There was nothing special about the Lyon delivery, well outside the off-stump and short. Quite rightly, Burns had a pop but instead of slapping it through point for four he got a little underedge straight into the gloves of the skipper. 16th over: England 53-0 (Denly 24, Burns 20) Would you believe it, a 50-partnership at the top of the list for the first time in the series. From either team, that is. They get to the milestone with two boundaries off the over, the first given as leg byes as Siddle misdirects (I reckon he hit it?), Burns getting full value later on from a lovely off-drive down to my OBO position at the Vauxhall End. \u201cI saw someone yesterday saying Archer\u2019s was the best debut series for an English bowler since Cork in 1995,\u201d writes John Cox. \u201cIt strikes me that this is a big understatement. Cork took 26 wickets in five tests at an average of 25 odd; Archer\u2019s taken 22 in three and a half at an average of 17. Also, Archer immediately looks like a world class bowler who can trouble any batsman on any surface. Cork immediately looked like what he was - a world class trier who would have his day occasionally in the right conditions. There\u2019s no comparison. The best debut series since SF Barnes would be nearer the mark.\u201d Hard to argue with that. A joy to watch up close. 15th over: England 45-0 (Denly 24, Burns 16) Another win from Denly against Lyon, dancing successfully for a third time in two overs, slotting him through extra cover for another boundary. It convinces the spinner to jump to a more defensive setting around the wicket. England\u2019s openers in very good nick here, Paine\u2019s change bowlers both under pressure. They cannot throw it away. 14th over: England 41-0 (Denly 20, Burns 16) An important day too for Siddle, who wasn\u2019t able to dry up the runs on the first day. That\u2019s pretty much his job description; Paine needs him today. Burns keeps the board ticking with one to square leg straight away. Siddle is right on the mark to the right-hander, finding the inside edge from a good length then cramping him up on middle stump. A fine response from the opener though, pushing through point across the square for a risk-free three. Burns defends the final ball from around the wicket. \u201cHammond\u2019s 905 (11th over) won\u2019t be reachable after Australia knock England over for 125,\u201d says Mac Millings. Usually, I\u2019d agree with that. But maybe, just maybe, today they put in a shift? From a statistical perspective, that\u2019s what I want, leaving Smith as many runs as possible for his inevitable (and first) fourth-innings ton. 13th over: England 37-0 (Denly 17, Burns 15) Nathan Lyon into the attack for the first time today, replacing Cummins. It was most unusual for him to only be called upon for four overs in the first innings - that will sting him a bit too, I reckon. He is causing Burns problems right away with the topspinner, finding the inside edge. It\u2019s easier for Denly, who gets down the track to defend a couple of times before dancing with authority to check-drive the spinner over his head for four. Great shot. He dances again at the next ball and hits him for six into the pavilion. Fantastic, assertive batting. If the job against Lyon is to deny Paine the ability to set-and-forget with him at one end, they\u2019ve made a perfect start of it. The lead is now 106. 12th over: England 26-0 (Denly 7, Burns 14) Good again from Burns, stroking one past point early in the Hazlewood set. Denly deals with the rest easily enough. We\u2019re not at risk of having a relatively sedate day of Test cricket with England at the crease, are we? Surely not? 11th over: England 25-0 (Denly 7, Burns 13) Cummins again at Burns to continue their good early stoush. He deals with the pace pretty well, leaving and ducking by default, working one to mid-off from the penultimate delivery. Denly cops a whack high on the leg from the one ball he has to see off. And with that, this pair are successfully through the always-tricky first half an hour. \u201cTo give Steve Smith two innings to get the record runs he may have thought there was a risk of there only being the one if Australia batted first,\u201d replies Mark Slater when pondering why Paine bowled first. I had it the other way around: let him bat big once then rack up some third-innings declaration runs. Not to be. Bradman\u2019s 974 is out of range now but Hammond\u2019s 905 from 1928-29 might be reachable? 10th over: England 24-0 (Denly 7, Burns 12) Hazlewood is all over Denly here, beating him twice to begin the over. So accurate; so consistent. But the Kent veteran, as he has quite a lot in this series, finds a way to get through. He\u2019s earned those winter tours, I think. 9th over: England 24-0 (Denly 7, Burns 12) Cummins bands in short to Burns to begin before going fuller in search of an edge. But the left-hander is all over it, driving with control through cover for his second boundary of the day. Nice. Of course, Cummins bounces straight back with a ball that bounces more than Burns expects, not quite getting his blade out of the way in time, the edge going to the cordon on the bounce. We\u2019ve seen Warner out that way a couple of times in this series. Speaking of, the papers have had a field day on him this morning - understandably so. I\u2019m told he needs 51 in the second dig to avoid the worst ever full series (five Tests) for an Australian top-order player in England. Was nice to see a few former England women internationals filing in this morning en route to a reunion of their 2005 Ashes win and 2009 Ashes/World Cup/World T20 triumphs. A big day ahead for them. 8th over: England 20-0 (Denly 7, Burns 8) Hazlewood sets up Denly nicely with a couple of balls angled in then following up with the one that decks away, beating the bat. He finds the edge later in the over but the opener plays it to the cordon with soft hands on the bounce. Word in from the Australian camp on Harris\u2019 hand, injuring it quite badly when dropping Denly yesterday, by the looks. \u201cMarcus Harris suffered split webbing on his left hand while fielding late yesterday which required seven stitches. He won\u2019t field but is expected to bat.\u201d 7th over: England 20-0 (Denly 7, Burns 8) Cummins is running in hard, testing out Denly with a shortish ball early in the over that he can\u2019t quite evade, the ball deflecting off him for a leg bye. Burns is happy enough leaving then defending. Good start from these two. \u201cI\u2019m a 60-something England supporter so of course my natural perspective is one of pessimism,\u201d writes Steve Whitefield. \u201cFor football this is well-founded but for cricket it makes the glorious moments all the more wonderful. Today however I\u2019m optimistic that someone will get a century.\u201d No better day for it. There\u2019s nothing in this track and the Australian bowlers must be tired after putting in a couple of big shifts already over the last six days. Remind me again why Australia bowled first? 6th over: England 19-0 (Denly 7, Burns 8) Hazlewood thinks he has Burns down the legside with his second ball of the day but it is turned down and they don\u2019t go upstairs. Thigh pad, by the looks of the replay. The left-hander ducks then defends before freeing his arms at a delivery short and well outside the off-stump, carving it over backward point, and to the rope, for his first runs of the day. 5th over: England 15-0 (Denly 7, Burns 4) Nice clip to begin from Denly, taking two from the first ball. Big day he had yesterday, coming from the hospital after the birth of his second child, taking the field just before lunch. Come 6:15pm he was opening the batting. His positive start continues later in the over, jumping onto the front foot and thumping a cover drive for four. Granted, it was in the air for a little bit, but he nailed the gap. Cummins responds by bending his back, generating enough movement to beat the bat by a long way, then whacking him in the thigh pad. Marcus Harris is off the field with a finger injury. I\u2019ll have more information on that shortly. I\u2019ll get ahead of the curve here with the OVERSEAS TMS LINK. Morning, all. Thanks JP. The players are on the field. Pat Cummins will kick off this third morning from the pavilion end. Joe Denly, the man who was put down last night, is facing up. PLAY! Thank you all once again for keeping me company. It\u2019s time for Adam Collins to step in, which means you\u2019d be well advised to refresh your page, retune your emails to adam.collins.casual@theguardian.com and tweets to @collinsadam. See you again tomorrow! \u201cIt was my birthday a few days ago and my son made me this birthday card,\u201d emails Richard Lankshear, innocently. But wait, there\u2019s more. \u201cNow I am proud that he has caught the bug of watching his first Ashes series, though I am struggling to interpret the meaning behind the game being played by pigs or that the letters are written in bacon.\u201d Richard has also kindly provided visual proof of the porcine Ashes. \u201cI am getting under my mum\u2019s feet at home while she looks after my dad who has dementia among his new age-related superpowers. But when I ask him if he would like to listen to the cricket there is a spark in his eyes that is worth any number of Superman capes.\u201d Thanks Ian Copestake. He\u2019s been treated to a good \u2018un this summer. The pitch still looks full of runs. Geoff Lemon has had little alternative but to extol the virtues of Steve Smith at regular intervals throughout this series. Yesterday was no exception. Had No 4 been filled by a batsman of similar calibre, Australia might have come to the Oval trailing 4-0. Instead the visitors have had Smith, meaning the fifth Test panned out like the fourth, and the second, and the first. He came to the crease at two down for bugger-all, batted through the departures of his colleagues, then did what he could with the tail. His 80 was his lowest score for the series in six attempts. What has stood out most about this absurdly prolific run is how the atmosphere of an innings has changed every time he has walked in. Jofra Archer fronted the press pack yesterday, a gallery including Ali Martin, who filed this report. Archer, fresh from his second six-wicket haul in only his fourth Test match for England, had noted a difference in how Smith looked at the crease, saying: \u201cIt might just be my perception of it but he didn\u2019t look as nailed on as he usually is.\u201d When Smith\u2019s bout of the sniffles was then put to him, the fast bowler replied: \u201cI knew there was something!\u201d Dennis O\u2019Neill might need his own byline after this email. \u201cFirst, what an extraordinary summer of cricket. The World Cup and an Ashes series that hasn\u2019t once given us a three day result (well, without tempting fate, anyway). It\u2019s been a fantastic series, disappointing result but you can\u2019t have everything. I know we\u2019ve bemoaned the loss of Jimmy Anderson, but we\u2019ve found Jofra Archer and now that Sam Curran seems to have been released from revising for his GCSEs, we could well have two potential replacements for Jimmy and Stuart Broad.\u201d An excellent opening salvo. \u201cI only get to see the highlights, but from what I saw last night, it was good to see the crowd finally giving Steve Smith more cheers than boos. Booing was an ok reaction at first, then it was quite funny but it got really irritating after the third or fourth innings. The point had been made.\u201d Agreed. \u201cHe was astonishing and while I know the Aussie bowlers have been immense, England\u2019s bowlers haven\u2019t really let themselves down - if you give Smith the same average as the rest of his team mates, I\u2019m convinced there\u2019s a strong argument for England winning this series 3-1, he\u2019s been that outstanding. I mean, his 80 yesterday was the poorest score of the series? That\u2019s beyond phenomenal and into properly ridiculous.\u201d Yep. \u201cNow to a couple of questions that I\u2019ve never understood about the game. What\u2019s the thinking behind a nightwatchman? If you\u2019re sending someone who\u2019s not a recognised batsman out to face an attack geed up and ready for blood, surely there\u2019s a strong possibility that the nightwatchman won\u2019t last the night, giving the other side a fillip? And even if he does, he\u2019s surely an expected victim early on the following day, giving the other side another psychological boost that there\u2019s one more down cheaply?\u201d Absolutely, and you\u2019ve articulated perfectly why the Australian default (in other words the alpha approach) has long been to avoid them. \u201cAnd if there is a good argument for that, why did England send out both their regular openers last night? Isn\u2019t the argument for nightwatchmen valid there too? Send out one opener and a nightwatchman or even two nightwatchman? I\u2019m not trying to be sarcastic or snide here, I\u2019m asking out of genuine ignorance.\u201d These are (valid) questions for men and women on a higher pay grade than I. \u201cNext, Denly survived an LBW shout because the ball pitched outside the line - I\u2019ve seen any number of LBWs that have pitched outside the line, but they\u2019ve been given. Again, genuine ignorance of the rules, here. I sometimes struggle with LBW, and I\u2019m someone who can understand the offside rule!\u201d Try this handy video Dennis. Hope that all helps! Sam Curran was always going to be the character columnists were drawn towards after his pugnacious cameo yesterday. Barney Ronay places Curran\u2019s pint-sized potency in the context of Steve Smith serenely dominating the series against an opponent lacking in spite. England will look back at this series and imagine how it might have played without Smith. It might be useful also to imagine what some more of this, a little more needle, a little more concerted aggression might have done to that obsessive, emasculating brilliance. \u201cHi Jonathan,\u201d hi Rob from Ashford. \u201cIt was only recently that I realised that Nathan Lyon\u2019s nickname Garry had derived from a Aussie rules star. I had always assumed it was because of the resemblance of Lyon to the Only Fools and Horses character that the Trotters brought back from France one episode. Here\u2019s to another excellent day!\u201d To an English audience I can imagine it\u2019s an odd one to figure out without an explanation. The whole \u201cGarry\u201d phenomenon exploded when Matthew Wade was behind the stumps and relentlessly bellowing \u201cNiiiiiiice Garrryyyyy!\u201d at every opportunity. Memes abounded (ovs). If you haven\u2019t read Vic Marks\u2019s report from day two at the Oval, what\u2019s wrong with you? Let\u2019s be \u2018avin you! The destination of the Ashes has, of course, been decided and that may explain the nature of some of the cricket in this Test so far. Both sides are straining every sinew in the knowledge that the series can still be won or drawn and there are points to be gleaned for the Test Championship. They are all doing their utmost to win. But they cannot always hide their fatigue after this long \u2013 and wonderful \u2013 summer of cricket. Hello everybody and welcome to live OBO coverage of day three of the fifth Ashes Test from the Oval. Unusually for this series the day begins with England in the box seat after a strong bowling and fielding performance yesterday transformed a mediocre first-innings total into a handy lead. There is now the real prospect of England salvaging a draw from the series and maintaining their five-year unbeaten record on home soil. Jofra Archer was England\u2019s star, proving once again that when he is on song he is among the most dangerous bowlers in the world. The challenge for England\u2019s strategists is to ensure the all-format weapon is physically capable of hitting that sort of form regularly, and for Joe Root (or someone in England\u2019s party) to become an Archer whisperer and understand how to coax out those game-changing spells on matchday. But as much as Archer\u2019s six-for dominates the scorebook, the hustle of Sam Curran should not be overlooked. The Surrey allrounder provided some welcome variation to England\u2019s attack with his left-armers but it was his infectious enthusiasm that shone. Diminutive and babyfaced Curran resembled an eager puppy learning how to bare his teeth in sibling combat, but it was long overdue aggression, especially to Steve Smith. It\u2019s a shame Curran has been the only newcomer on display in south London with his youthful exuberance restoring some pep to a line-up that looked weary at Old Trafford. Speaking of Smith, he continued his extraordinary summer with another half-century (natch), but it is a measure of his mind boggling form that 80 is now considered something of a failure. Once again the rest of Australia\u2019s top order struggled, ramming home the point that this series will rightly be remembered as one of the all-time great individual performances. If you don\u2019t know the drill by now, I\u2019m around for an hour or so but when play begins Adam Collins will take over.

Keshi Anderson got the first, firing into the top corner in the 37th minute then Eoin Doyle made his mark on the game, scoring the second and third goals either side of the break. Defeats for Newport and Crewe meant Forest Green\u2019s 1-0 win at home over Colchester sent Mark Cooper\u2019s side up to third, as Luke Prosser put through his own net for the game\u2019s only goal. Mark Sampson\u2019s first game with Stevenage ended in defeat as Harry McKirdy\u2019s second of the game gave Carlisle a 3-2 win at the Lamex. Boro\u2019s fellow strugglers Scunthorpe had a better day. They got into a 3-0 lead at the break at home to Morecambe and that was that.",

Wright lives very near one of my son\u2019s friends and I\u2019ve often wondered about his house, an ordinary small terrace that, even from the street, is clearly a strange and magical environment. A blue fence with bright tiles, faces on top of the columns, lots of trees\u2026</p> <p>There are pictures of the House of Dreams online if you want to see it, but the beauty of this programme was that you didn\u2019t need to. Made by producer par excellence Eleanor McDowall, this told a different, nonvisual story, of life and grief and art and acceptance.</p> <p>Wright bought the house in the 90s with his partner, Donald, and, inspired by a TV programme about outsider artists, began decorating it with toys, trinkets, found objects \u2013 the tat that others leave behind.</p> <p>Several years later, after Donald died, when Wright met his present partner, Michael, there was nowhere for Michael to sit down. When he found somewhere, he was faced by about 40 doll\u2019s heads, all staring at him.</p> <p>McDowall, rather than obsessing over the freakery, focused on Wright\u2019s gentle character, and the relationships that inspired his art-house-life. Donald was one, clearly, and Wright gave a lovely description of how and when they met, just around the corner: \u201cI was wearing a red check shirt and blue jeans.\u201d That instinct for remembering is very much part of Wright\u2019s art. Just outside the front door he has his late mum and dad\u2019s dentures, set in cement: \u201cI can see their faces through their teeth sticking out,\u201d he said, sweetly.</p> <p>Music, specially made by <a href=\"https://jeremywarmsley.bandcamp.com/\" title=\"\">Jeremy Warmsley</a> seemed to reflect Wright\u2019s gentle eccentricity, his care and love. People visit the House of Dreams, and they tell him about their lives. What a beautiful man, and what a beautiful programme.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a78594b22cbc24812ed4b5357181a0ca30c8bb5f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a78594b22cbc24812ed4b5357181a0ca30c8bb5f/1564_221_3980_2388/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marian Keyes: \u2018a laugh-out-loud hoot\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marian Keyes: \u2018a laugh-out-loud hoot\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levenson/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Between Ourselves with Marian Keyes</strong>, also on Radio 4, put together the author Marian Keyes with the actor and writer Tara Flynn, and they were a laugh-out-loud hoot. The show, recorded in front of a live audience, allowed both women to be funny, though it was really there to showcase the immensely popular Keyes. She read her nonfiction (about the true meaning of Irish words, and getting a passport from the Irish embassy in London) and I laughed like a drain.</p> <p>Producer Steve Doherty is responsible for putting David Sedaris\u2019s live shows on radio, and this was just as warm and hilarious.

      "bodyText": "House of Dreams | BBC Radio 4 Between Ourselves with Marian Keyes | BBC Radio 4 Two engaging and very different Radio 4 shows this week; succour in dismal times. House of Dreams concerned the home of the artist Stephen Wright, in East Dulwich, south London. Wright lives very near one of my son\u2019s friends and I\u2019ve often wondered about his house, an ordinary small terrace that, even from the street, is clearly a strange and magical environment. A blue fence with bright tiles, faces on top of the columns, lots of trees\u2026 There are pictures of the House of Dreams online if you want to see it, but the beauty of this programme was that you didn\u2019t need to. Made by producer par excellence Eleanor McDowall, this told a different, nonvisual story, of life and grief and art and acceptance. Wright bought the house in the 90s with his partner, Donald, and, inspired by a TV programme about outsider artists, began decorating it with toys, trinkets, found objects \u2013 the tat that others leave behind. Several years later, after Donald died, when Wright met his present partner, Michael, there was nowhere for Michael to sit down. When he found somewhere, he was faced by about 40 doll\u2019s heads, all staring at him. McDowall, rather than obsessing over the freakery, focused on Wright\u2019s gentle character, and the relationships that inspired his art-house-life. Donald was one, clearly, and Wright gave a lovely description of how and when they met, just around the corner: \u201cI was wearing a red check shirt and blue jeans.\u201d That instinct for remembering is very much part of Wright\u2019s art. Just outside the front door he has his late mum and dad\u2019s dentures, set in cement: \u201cI can see their faces through their teeth sticking out,\u201d he said, sweetly. Music, specially made by Jeremy Warmsley seemed to reflect Wright\u2019s gentle eccentricity, his care and love. People visit the House of Dreams, and they tell him about their lives. What a beautiful man, and what a beautiful programme. Between Ourselves with Marian Keyes, also on Radio 4, put together the author Marian Keyes with the actor and writer Tara Flynn, and they were a laugh-out-loud hoot. The show, recorded in front of a live audience, allowed both women to be funny, though it was really there to showcase the immensely popular Keyes. She read her nonfiction (about the true meaning of Irish words, and getting a passport from the Irish embassy in London) and I laughed like a drain. Producer Steve Doherty is responsible for putting David Sedaris\u2019s live shows on radio, and this was just as warm and hilarious. It made Radio 4\u2019s usual 6.30pm comedy efforts seem very stagey \u2013 which is weird, as this was very definitely staged. Funny women given space to be funny. A tonic. Not much room to bemoan the BBC\u2019s premature shutting down of its iPlayer Radio app, but bemoan it I shall. The app is to be wound down tomorrow, as \u2013 according to the BBC \u2013 the BBC Sounds app does everything that iPlayer Radio does and more. But it doesn\u2019t, does it?

      "body": "<p>In November 2015, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/lisaappignanesi\" title=\"\">Lisa Appignanesi</a>\u2019s partner of 32 years, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/dec/03/john-forrester\" title=\"\">John Forrester</a>, the Cambridge professor of philosophy, died. He had been undergoing treatment for lymphoma, but the death and its repercussions caught Appignanesi by surprise. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/sep/16/everyday-madness-lisa-appignanesi-review-burden-of-bereavement\" title=\"\"><em>Everyday Madness</em>,</a> she writes of the psychological descent she undertook after his death, anatomising her emotional state, her not always easy relationship with Forrester and the intersection between her own helpless rage and the bilious emanations of contemporary populist politics.</p> <p>Appignanesi is one of our leading writers on psychology and the author of 30 works of fiction, nonfiction and criticism. She is a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature.</p> <p><strong>Does writing about a death change the way you feel about it?</strong><br>I think writers write in order to know what they\u2019re feeling. Writing becomes part of the process of understanding. I was so unprepared for it; despite the fact I had read about grieving and loss, despite having lost my parents, this was different. And what was different was that there was simply nothing else I could think about. Too little is said about how extraordinarily obsessional the state becomes. You might not show it on the outside, but on the inside part of yourself has been torn away. It showed me how much we are made up of our closest others. Their absence \u2013 and this happens when people separate, but death is more final \u2013 tears you up terribly.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We are grieving an idea of a lost England that probably never existed</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>Your overriding emotion </strong><strong>after the death was rage. Did this surprise you?</strong><br>I was completely unprepared for the emotions. Largely what you felt about the dead was that they were the dear departed and that you wanted to honour them and memorialise them. That was there, but the predominant emotion was much more violent and much more angry. I now see that rage and anger and fury are part of the mourning process. Because of the sudden helplessness, of your impotence in the face of it, you rage. And while that rage may take different forms in different people, everyday madness was the way it took me.</p> <p><strong>It\u2019s a book about death, but it\u2019s also about what it is to care for someone you love when they become ill.</strong><br>As we grow older, more and more of us are living with others in conditions of illness. Relationships shift and change under those conditions. The things you can and cannot talk about change; secrets change; bodily functions change. One of the reasons I decided to be quite so brutal in the book was that we were both deranged \u2013 I don\u2019t mean we were raving, but we weren\u2019t right. We reflected all of the stress and anxiety and vulnerability that illness puts upon you.</p> <p><strong>\u201cAnger and loss are political,\u201d you write, \u201cnot simply personal.\u201d How did the rage of the world reflect your own rage?</strong><br>The rage I try to anatomise in the book in the instance of Brexit and the rise of the populist right has to do with powerlessness, with the sense of a vulnerability that dare not speak its name. And it\u2019s directed at others, at outsiders, at immigrants, at people of different races \u2013 choose your targets. And the anger has been fomented and used against these targets. I realised that my own anger was mirrored in those I met everywhere. That the country had turned against itself. Usually, people are quite nice to each other on English streets, but that has changed. If you talk to therapists, they\u2019re seeing so many people on their couches who are raging at Brexit, at the fact they are unable to agree with those close to them. We do need to come to the end of the process, which I think is like a grieving process. What are we grieving? An idea of a lost England that probably never existed, in the same way that we grieve the lost pastoral of childhood.</p> <p><strong>What books are on your bedside table?</strong><br>It\u2019s heaving and now it heaves on to the other side of the bed where there isn\u2019t another person. Having just done a big piece on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/susan-sontag\" title=\"\">Susan Sontag</a>, I have a lot of her work, her stories, her essays. I have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/aug/26/quichotte-salman-rushdie-review\" title=\"\">Salman Rushdie\u2019s <em>Quichotte</em></a>. I have Kathrine Kressman Taylor\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/aug/23/in-praise-of-address-unknown-the-anti-nazi-novel-that-saw-into-the-future\" title=\"\"><em>Address Unknown</em></a>, that epistolary book about a wartime correspondence between a Jew living in San Francisco and his erstwhile partner who goes back to Germany. It\u2019s exquisite, to be read in one sitting.</p> <p><strong>What is the last really great book you read?</strong><br>Can I name two because I tend to be an enthusiast? I can never name just one\u2026 I loved Deborah Levy\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/aug/25/the-man-who-saw-everything-deborah-levy-review\" title=\"\"><em>The Man Who Saw Everything</em></a>. Then there\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/benjamin-markovits\" title=\"\">Benjamin Markovits</a>\u2019s new book, <em>Christmas in Austin</em>, which hasn\u2019t been published yet. I adored it. He\u2019s wonderful and I love this series, it\u2019s just beautiful. It gives you such an extraordinary sense of family life, so much better than one usually gets.</p> <p><strong>What do you read for sheer pleasure?</strong><br>I\u2019m one of these terrible people who actually just loves reading. But for a long time after John died I had a real problem finishing novels. I had an allergy to endings. I can now get to the end again, which is great in itself. In the past, I\u2019ve read a lot of detective fiction. I love the unfurling of fiction, nothing too thrilling, not too much blood and gore. And now, recently, because I\u2019ve got grandchildren, I\u2019ve decided the greatest writer in the world is AA <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/aa-milne\" title=\"\">Milne</a>. Every time I read him, I just think how he has everything \u2013 metafiction, humour, wisdom. I love being caught up with children again.</p> <p><strong>What book would you give to a </strong><strong>10-year-old?</strong><br>I haven\u2019t quite got to 10 yet, but good readers at the age of 10 can read Jane Austen, Conrad. It depends what sort of reader they are. I loved Philip Pullman, so maybe I\u2019d give them <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/18/the-book-of-dust-vol-1-la-belle-sauvage-by-philip-pullman-review\" title=\"\"><em>La Belle Sauvage</em></a>.</p> <p><strong>Which classic book did you read recently for the first time?</strong><br>It wasn\u2019t for the first time, but it felt like the first time: I read the <em>Oresteia</em>.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Everyday Madness</em> by Lisa Appignanesi is published by Harper Collins (\u00a39.99).

      "bodyText": "In November 2015, Lisa Appignanesi\u2019s partner of 32 years, John Forrester, the Cambridge professor of philosophy, died. He had been undergoing treatment for lymphoma, but the death and its repercussions caught Appignanesi by surprise. In Everyday Madness, she writes of the psychological descent she undertook after his death, anatomising her emotional state, her not always easy relationship with Forrester and the intersection between her own helpless rage and the bilious emanations of contemporary populist politics. Appignanesi is one of our leading writers on psychology and the author of 30 works of fiction, nonfiction and criticism. She is a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. Does writing about a death change the way you feel about it? I think writers write in order to know what they\u2019re feeling. Writing becomes part of the process of understanding. I was so unprepared for it; despite the fact I had read about grieving and loss, despite having lost my parents, this was different. And what was different was that there was simply nothing else I could think about. Too little is said about how extraordinarily obsessional the state becomes. You might not show it on the outside, but on the inside part of yourself has been torn away. It showed me how much we are made up of our closest others. Their absence \u2013 and this happens when people separate, but death is more final \u2013 tears you up terribly. Your overriding emotion after the death was rage. Did this surprise you? I was completely unprepared for the emotions. Largely what you felt about the dead was that they were the dear departed and that you wanted to honour them and memorialise them. That was there, but the predominant emotion was much more violent and much more angry. I now see that rage and anger and fury are part of the mourning process. Because of the sudden helplessness, of your impotence in the face of it, you rage. And while that rage may take different forms in different people, everyday madness was the way it took me. It\u2019s a book about death, but it\u2019s also about what it is to care for someone you love when they become ill. As we grow older, more and more of us are living with others in conditions of illness. Relationships shift and change under those conditions. The things you can and cannot talk about change; secrets change; bodily functions change. One of the reasons I decided to be quite so brutal in the book was that we were both deranged \u2013 I don\u2019t mean we were raving, but we weren\u2019t right. We reflected all of the stress and anxiety and vulnerability that illness puts upon you. \u201cAnger and loss are political,\u201d you write, \u201cnot simply personal.\u201d How did the rage of the world reflect your own rage? The rage I try to anatomise in the book in the instance of Brexit and the rise of the populist right has to do with powerlessness, with the sense of a vulnerability that dare not speak its name. And it\u2019s directed at others, at outsiders, at immigrants, at people of different races \u2013 choose your targets. And the anger has been fomented and used against these targets. I realised that my own anger was mirrored in those I met everywhere. That the country had turned against itself. Usually, people are quite nice to each other on English streets, but that has changed. If you talk to therapists, they\u2019re seeing so many people on their couches who are raging at Brexit, at the fact they are unable to agree with those close to them. We do need to come to the end of the process, which I think is like a grieving process. What are we grieving? An idea of a lost England that probably never existed, in the same way that we grieve the lost pastoral of childhood. What books are on your bedside table? It\u2019s heaving and now it heaves on to the other side of the bed where there isn\u2019t another person. Having just done a big piece on Susan Sontag, I have a lot of her work, her stories, her essays. I have Salman Rushdie\u2019s Quichotte. I have Kathrine Kressman Taylor\u2019s Address Unknown, that epistolary book about a wartime correspondence between a Jew living in San Francisco and his erstwhile partner who goes back to Germany. It\u2019s exquisite, to be read in one sitting. What is the last really great book you read? Can I name two because I tend to be an enthusiast? I can never name just one\u2026 I loved Deborah Levy\u2019s The Man Who Saw Everything. Then there\u2019s Benjamin Markovits\u2019s new book, Christmas in Austin, which hasn\u2019t been published yet. I adored it. He\u2019s wonderful and I love this series, it\u2019s just beautiful. It gives you such an extraordinary sense of family life, so much better than one usually gets. What do you read for sheer pleasure? I\u2019m one of these terrible people who actually just loves reading. But for a long time after John died I had a real problem finishing novels. I had an allergy to endings. I can now get to the end again, which is great in itself. In the past, I\u2019ve read a lot of detective fiction. I love the unfurling of fiction, nothing too thrilling, not too much blood and gore. And now, recently, because I\u2019ve got grandchildren, I\u2019ve decided the greatest writer in the world is AA Milne. Every time I read him, I just think how he has everything \u2013 metafiction, humour, wisdom. I love being caught up with children again. What book would you give to a 10-year-old? I haven\u2019t quite got to 10 yet, but good readers at the age of 10 can read Jane Austen, Conrad. It depends what sort of reader they are. I loved Philip Pullman, so maybe I\u2019d give them La Belle Sauvage. Which classic book did you read recently for the first time? It wasn\u2019t for the first time, but it felt like the first time: I read the Oresteia. \u2022 Everyday Madness by Lisa Appignanesi is published by Harper Collins (\u00a39.99).

The Green party\u2019s co-leader Jonathan Bartley later said:\u201cIt\u2019s a real shame that the <em>Today</em> programme didn\u2019t think to have a Green voice on to help John Humphrys get his facts right this morning: a 1.5% increase is not the same as a 1.5 degree increase.\u201d A spokesperson for <em>Today</em> later pushed back: \u201cAt no point did John Humphrys challenge or undermine the suggestion that action was needed.\u201d</p> <h2>Office wars</h2> <p><strong>Temperature-gate, 2015</strong></p> <p>Sometimes a comparatively innocuous comment has rebounded on the <em>Today</em> presenter. Coverage of a report that suggested women in offices often have to put up with low temperatures because men prefer it that way led his co-presenter, Sarah Montague, to hint she had a running battle with Humphrys over the setting on the studio thermostat. The public response to their altercation ran on through the following week.</p> <p><strong>Gender pay scandal, 2018</strong></p> <p>Following the revelation that Humphrys had a salary of \u00a3600,000-\u00a3649,000 and that Jon Sopel, the BBC\u2019s North America editor, earned \u00a3200,000-\u00a3249,999, an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/jan/12/john-humphrys-jokes-about-bbc-gender-pay-gap-in-leaked-off-air-recording\" title=\"\">off-air bit of joshing between the two</a> was made embarrassingly public.

All the time.\u201d According to the junior presenter, the two almost came to blows on air. \u201cI had foolishly tried to defend myself against his latest (probably well deserved) \u2026 criticism by daring to suggest that one of his own recent foreign reports was unlikely to trouble the Sony Award judges either.

Humphrys repeatedly asked why the debt had not gone down as a share of GDP, and he wanted the reasons behind a decision to break Osborne\u2019s own cap on welfare spending. \u201cI suppose what I\u2019m asking is \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p03n0rbl\" title=\"\">what\u2019s a bloke got to do in your job to get the sack?</a>\u201d he concluded.</p> <p><strong>Alexandra Shulman, 2017</strong></p> <p>The outgoing <em>Vogue</em> editor Shulman, while being <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/alexandra-shulman-john-humphrys-fashion-mansplaining-british-vogue-editor-a7929136.html\" title=\"\">interviewed</a> about her views on fashion, was given a far from easy ride. \u201cI unexpectedly found myself having to defend the fashion industry from all manner of evil, such as promoting anorexia among young girls,\u201d said Shulman, adding: \u201cSuddenly I was confronted by a grey-haired guy in chinos hectoring me on the business I had worked in for a quarter of a century and which he neither knew, nor cared, much about.\u201d</p> <p>Humphrys later claimed he was right to ask about Shulman\u2019s influential role in promoting certain images of beauty: \u201cIt was massively interesting, and actually a rather important subject, particularly if you advance the proposition, which I did, that magazines like <em>Vogue</em> and the fashionistas in general, pushed the idea for many years, and are still pushing it, though they deny it, that in order to look nice you\u2019ve got to be stick-thin.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Ed Miliband, 2019</strong></p> <p>In the spring of this year, the former Labour leader hoped to draw attention to the growing climate emergency <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/energy/2019/04/bizarrely-hectoring-john-humphrys-criticised-ed-miliband-climate-change\" title=\"\">but was asked to account for his views at every point</a>. \u201cDuring the war, we had rationing, we couldn\u2019t go anywhere because there was no fuel and so on \u2013 are you telling us we shouldn\u2019t fly, we shouldn\u2019t drive, we should change the way we eat?\u201d asked Humphrys. Miliband listed new ways to heat homes, but was challenged again by Humphrys: \u201cWhere are we gonna get that gas from? We\u2019re not going to get it from fracking because that\u2019s not going to be allowed any longer.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "For good or ill, after 32 years serving on the frontline of radio news presentation for the Today programme, John Humphrys has become an emblem of BBC journalism. One of the corporation\u2019s journalistic attack dogs, he has been the interviewer that political leaders, notably Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn, are keenest to dodge. This week, Humphrys is finally to bow out in the company of a former prime minister. David Cameron will brave an interview on the eve of the publication of his memoir \u2013 and it promises to be a vintage encounter. The avowedly impartial BBC, which Humphrys joined in 1966, regularly deploys the defence that it must be doing something right because it is equally unpopular with Remainers and Brexiters, with one-nation Tories and radical socialists, and with feminist activists and reactionary misogynists. And as Humphrys leaves Radio 4\u2019s flagship news show at the age of 76, he could certainly make a similar claim. Since February, when his decision to step down was announced, public criticism of his performances has cranked up a gear. It is as if Today listeners are racing to fit in their complaints now that time is short. As a result, 2019 has brought a series of fevered reactions, for instance, to an antagonistic interview with the Labour MP Andy McDonald, to an inappropriate quip about domestic abuse shared with the Conservative MP David Davis and to a traditionalist suggestion that women \u201cdo a better job\u201d of caring for babies. Assailed on all sides, Humphrys nevertheless has remained, like Auntie, a venerated feature of Britain\u2019s media culture. Making the news Andrew Gilligan\u2019s report, 2003 BBC correspondent Gilligan told Humphrys he had been informed by a reliable source that a dossier warning the government of the threat posed by Saddam Hussein had been deliberately \u201csexed up\u201d. The exchange, Humphrys later said, \u201cnearly brought down the BBC\u201d. And it also shook the nation. The suicide of the story\u2019s secret source, Dr David Kelly, followed, as did the resignation of the BBC\u2019s director-general, Greg Dyke, and its chairman, Gavyn Davies. The Hutton inquiry and, latterly, the Chilcot inquiry into the war in Iraq, came in its wake. Julian Assange, 2010 Once the Wikileaks founder, Julian Assange, had been freed on bail by the high court, he had to face questions about his sexual experiences from Humphrys. The presenter did not hold back, repeating the claims of two Swedish women that Assange was a sexual predator who preferred having sex with young women without a condom. Assange famously replied: \u201cA gentleman does not discuss his private life.\u201d Asked how many women he had slept with, he answered: \u201cA gentleman does not count.\u201d George Entwistle, 2012 As BBC director-general, Entwistle survived only 54 days in the role due in part to the grilling he received from Humphrys after revelations about the crimes of the late Jimmy Savile. Dubbed by the Guardian as the \u201cdead-man-walking interview\u201d, in it Entwistle revealed his lack of knowledge about a Newsnight report that wrongly implicated a Tory peer in other allegations of sexual abuse. Part of the interview ran like this: Humphrys: \u201cThe Guardian yesterday carried a front-page story, which we now know was right, that cast doubt, serious doubt, on the BBC\u2019s Newsnight programme \u2026 You didn\u2019t know that actually happened?\u201d Entwistle: \u201cNo, I\u2019m afraid I didn\u2019t.\u201d Entwistle resigned 12 hours later. Humphrys later told Radio 4\u2019s Broadcasting House show: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a happy moment, and not just because he was a colleague, which of course he was, and I both like and respect him, but you don\u2019t want to see somebody facing that sort of interview \u2026 I didn\u2019t set out to humiliate him, of course I didn\u2019t.\u201d Mixed emotions Return to Cardiff, 2010 An assignment on the streets of his home city, Cardiff, shocked the broadcaster. Humphrys was upset to hear from pub clientele that the \u201cwhole point of the evening is to get drunk \u2013 on cheap booze\u201d. He said: \u201cIn my local a pint of bitter is well over \u00a33.

Clare Hollingworth, 2015 In a piece celebrating the life of the influential and groundbreaking foreign correspondent, Humphrys admitted she had scared him when they worked together, saying: \u201cShe absolutely terrified me.\u201d Her abrasive style was clearly an influence. Snubs and clangers The Queen, 2013 Humphrys\u2019s efforts to \u201cdoorstep the Queen\u201d with an impromptu question when she visited the BBC went down badly with some. He ventured a bland comment about Prince Philip \u201clooking well yesterday\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s because he\u2019s not ill,\u201d Her Majesty replied curtly. Later, offering the monarch a digital radio as a gift, he was told: \u201cI don\u2019t get an awful lot of chance to listen to the radio.\u201d Michael Gove, 2017 The broadcaster\u2019s apparent enjoyment of an ill-judged joke made by guest Michael Gove about the behaviour of the serial sexual abuser Harvey Weinstein was one of Today\u2019s least edifying moments \u2013 and it was supposed to be marking the show\u2019s 60th anniversary. The then-environment secretary later admitted he had made a \u201cclumsy attempt at humour\u201d. Coming into a studio with Humphrys, Gove had said, \u201cis a bit like going into Harvey Weinstein\u2019s bedroom. You hope to emerge with your dignity intact.\u201d Barry Gardiner, 2018 The presenter faced a barrage of criticism after a combative interview with Labour\u2019s shadow energy minister, Gardiner, in which Humphrys appeared to muddle degrees of temperature with percentages. The Green party\u2019s co-leader Jonathan Bartley later said:\u201cIt\u2019s a real shame that the Today programme didn\u2019t think to have a Green voice on to help John Humphrys get his facts right this morning: a 1.5% increase is not the same as a 1.5 degree increase.\u201d A spokesperson for Today later pushed back: \u201cAt no point did John Humphrys challenge or undermine the suggestion that action was needed.\u201d Office wars Temperature-gate, 2015 Sometimes a comparatively innocuous comment has rebounded on the Today presenter. Coverage of a report that suggested women in offices often have to put up with low temperatures because men prefer it that way led his co-presenter, Sarah Montague, to hint she had a running battle with Humphrys over the setting on the studio thermostat. The public response to their altercation ran on through the following week. Gender pay scandal, 2018 Following the revelation that Humphrys had a salary of \u00a3600,000-\u00a3649,000 and that Jon Sopel, the BBC\u2019s North America editor, earned \u00a3200,000-\u00a3249,999, an off-air bit of joshing between the two was made embarrassingly public. The former China editor Carrie Gracie had recently complained that her salary was not comparable. Humphrys joked that his first question would be about how much of Sopel\u2019s salary he was prepared to hand over to Gracie. Sopel replied: \u201cI mean, obviously if we are talking about the scope for the greatest redistribution I\u2019ll have to come back and say: \u2018Well yes Mr Humphrys, but \u2026 \u201d Humphrys responded: \u201cAnd I could save you the trouble as I could volunteer that I\u2019ve handed over already more than you fucking earn but I\u2019m still left with more than anybody else and that seems to me to be entirely just \u2013 something like that would do it?\u201d Humphrys subsequently took another salary cut. David Dimbleby, 2018 The former Question Time host David Dimbleby guest edited the Today programme last December and argued with Humphrys over who was the \u201cposhest\u201d when Humphrys claimed Dimbleby was \u201cquite posh\u201d. \u201cSorry John, there\u2019s a typical sneer in that question. You\u2019re quite posh, I\u2019m about as posh as you are. I come from Wales, you do. I\u2019m not posh, I happen to have been a broadcaster for a long time,\u201d the former Question Time presenter said. Rival definitions of poshness gripped the nation. Bruising encounters Brian Redhead, 1987 Early in his Today career, a young Humphrys presented alongside Brian Redhead, a broadcasting titan who Humphrys said \u201cexpected everyone to be as sharp and clever as he was. All the time.\u201d According to the junior presenter, the two almost came to blows on air. \u201cI had foolishly tried to defend myself against his latest (probably well deserved) \u2026 criticism by daring to suggest that one of his own recent foreign reports was unlikely to trouble the Sony Award judges either. How we got through the rest of the programme is still a mystery to me. But afterwards he put his arm around my shoulders and all was well.\u201d George Osborne, 2016 When bleak public finances were made public, Osborne, the then-chancellor, was asked to explain how he had missed two of his three key economic targets. Humphrys repeatedly asked why the debt had not gone down as a share of GDP, and he wanted the reasons behind a decision to break Osborne\u2019s own cap on welfare spending. \u201cI suppose what I\u2019m asking is \u2013 what\u2019s a bloke got to do in your job to get the sack?\u201d he concluded. Alexandra Shulman, 2017 The outgoing Vogue editor Shulman, while being interviewed about her views on fashion, was given a far from easy ride. \u201cI unexpectedly found myself having to defend the fashion industry from all manner of evil, such as promoting anorexia among young girls,\u201d said Shulman, adding: \u201cSuddenly I was confronted by a grey-haired guy in chinos hectoring me on the business I had worked in for a quarter of a century and which he neither knew, nor cared, much about.\u201d Humphrys later claimed he was right to ask about Shulman\u2019s influential role in promoting certain images of beauty: \u201cIt was massively interesting, and actually a rather important subject, particularly if you advance the proposition, which I did, that magazines like Vogue and the fashionistas in general, pushed the idea for many years, and are still pushing it, though they deny it, that in order to look nice you\u2019ve got to be stick-thin.\u201d Ed Miliband, 2019 In the spring of this year, the former Labour leader hoped to draw attention to the growing climate emergency but was asked to account for his views at every point. \u201cDuring the war, we had rationing, we couldn\u2019t go anywhere because there was no fuel and so on \u2013 are you telling us we shouldn\u2019t fly, we shouldn\u2019t drive, we should change the way we eat?\u201d asked Humphrys. Miliband listed new ways to heat homes, but was challenged again by Humphrys: \u201cWhere are we gonna get that gas from? We\u2019re not going to get it from fracking because that\u2019s not going to be allowed any longer.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "With action under way at Carrow Road, I\u2019m going to be on my bike. But don\u2019t go away! You can follow Norwich v Manchester City here. Bye! Tammy Abraham is happy: It\u2019s been an amazing day. To come here, it\u2019s never easy. I\u2019m glad to get a hat-trick, delighted. The boys create a lot of chances and for me it\u2019s just about being in the right place at the right time. The three of us were last off the pitch. We couldn\u2019t believe we\u2019ve all scored in the same game for Chelsea. We\u2019ve dreamt of it since we were small boys and we\u2019ve made it happen. We were disappointed with our last result, we came here for three points and thankfully we got it. Finally, here\u2019s a report on Burnley\u2019s smash-and-grab point-theft at Brighton: A late equaliser from Burnley\u2019s Jeff Hendrick earned his side a 1-1 draw as Brighton\u2019s winless streak at the Amex Stadium continued. After a goalless first half Neal Maupay broke the deadlock, striking a superb volley from the edge of the box. The Seagulls looked to be heading towards victory before the ball fell to Hendrick outside the box and he sent a powerful drive past the outstretched Mathew Ryan and into the bottom corner. More here: After his hat-trick today, Tammy Abraham has taken the lead in the race for the golden boot. Check out the runners and riders here: Ed Aarons was at the Valley to see Jude Bellingham claim the points for Birmingham: As the son of one of the most prolific strikers to have graced the non-league game, Jude Bellingham should have learned a thing or two about scoring goals. The 16-year-old, whose father Mark racked up more than 700 in his career while also serving as a sergeant for West Midlands Police, inflicted Charlton\u2019s first defeat of the season with a superb strike just after half-time as Pep Clotet\u2019s side played party poopers on the 100th anniversary of the first match played at this ground. Much more here: Paul Doyle was at Molineux for today\u2019s bumper goal feast: This was supposed to be a day of celebration for Wolves, as they marked the 130th anniversary of their first match at Molineux. Instead a new Chelsea goalscoring hero stole the show, as Tammy Abraham struck his first hat-trick for the club after Fikayo Tomori started the rout by opening his own account with a wonderful strike from long-range. Late goals for Romain Sa\u00efss and Patrick Cutrone gave the hosts a little cheer and took away some of Chelsea\u2019s satisfaction. Mason Mount restored some it by making the score 5-2 in stoppage time. Dear old Molineux had been a fortress for Wolves for most of this year, with the home side unbeaten in any competition here since January, but by half-time that was all irrelevant history. They were 3-0 down and in danger of an even worse mauling. Much more here: Jacob Steinberg was at White Hart Lane: When was the last time Tottenham produced a performance this complete in a league game? You\u2019d probably have to go back to last season\u2019s Boxing Day victory over Bournemouth to find one, which goes to show how long it has been since Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s side played with this much energy, class and craft. In that context this thrashing of Crystal Palace could end up being remembered as one of the most important victories of the Pochettino era. After a spluttering start to the season, not to mention all the angst caused by the uncertainty over Christian Eriksen\u2019s future during the summer, Spurs demonstrated that there is plenty of life left in them yet by devouring a ragged Palace side during a first half in which Son Heung-min stole the show with two goals of the highest quality. Much more here: Daniel Taylor has filed his match report from Old Trafford: The good news for Manchester United is that they have rediscovered their winning habit. They won this game despite missing a number of key players with injury and, for that alone, Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r can probably accept the fact their performance never got any higher than six out of ten \u2013 lots of huffing and puffing, but none of the old panache. Leicester certainly had enough of the ball to believe they ought to have extended United\u2019s winless sequence to four matches. Ultimately, though, Solskj\u00e6r and his players can reflect on a decent afternoon\u2019s work bearing in mind Leicester have ambitions of their own to break into the Premier League\u2019s top four this season. Much more here: Rochdale finished with 64% of possession, which they managed to translate into absolutely no shots on target and a 6-0 defeat at Peterborough. Are the stats wrong, or was this the most hapless performance in the entire history of football? The match reports are starting to drop. To kick things off, here\u2019s Paul Wilson at Bramall Lane: Being billed as the new Sadio Man\u00e9 gives 21-year-old Moussa Djenepo a lot to live up to, though in his brief appearances since a \u00a315m move from Standard Liege the Malian winger has proved he can score spectacular goals. This was his first start in Saints colours, and he decorated it with a memorable solo strike that deserved to take all three points. Much more here: Conscious though I am that Manchester United have had a few penalties of late, I remain astonished by this: You can find all today\u2019s scores here. After Southampton took the lead Sheffield United huffed and puffed, but blew their chance when Billy Sharp got harshly sent off. Marcus Rashford\u2019s early penalty is the only goal of the game as Manchester United snaffle victory over Leicester. And that is the last meaningful action at Molineux! It\u2019s been an absolute goal feast, at the end of which Chelsea pocket the points. GOAL! Wolverhampton Wanderers 2-5 Chelsea (Mount, 90+6 mins) Mason Mount gets the ball on the left, just outside the area, and dances into the box, feints this way and that, then cuts onto his right foot and curls a nonchalant finish past Rui Patricio! I don\u2019t know what Spurs were playing at in the second half, in which they completely and miserably failed to score. No matter, they won at a canter. \u201cHow\u2019s it going at Old Trafford?\u201d asks Julian Smith. Quietly, though Leicester have been prodding, poking and vaguely threatening for much of the second half, to no avail. And now it\u2019s all over at the Amex. That\u2019s going to smart. Painful statistic department: That was Burnley\u2019s first shot on target. GOAL! Brighton 1-1 Burnley (Hendrick, 90+1 mins) A lovely backheel lay-off from Vydra is followed by a beautiful shot, pinged low from 23 yards (or so) right into the right-hand corner of goal! That is delicious! Chelsea have let in 11 goals in five league games, all while basically being quite impressive. GOAL! Wolverhampton Wanderers 2-4 Chelsea (Cutrone, 85 mins) Cutrone bundles in from the closest possible range after Kepa saved, er, someone else\u2019s shot! Billy Sharp is off, and Sheffield United\u2019s chance of rescuing a point at home to Southampton surely goes with him. That looked very harsh \u2013 he threw out a leg, realised he wouldn\u2019t get near the ball and pulled it back again before any contact was made with his opponent, Stuart Armstrong. Here are the teams for the Premier League\u2019s late kick-off. Norwich have two goalkeepers on the bench, and could probably do with having both of them on the pitch: Norwich: Krul, Byram, Amadou, Godfrey, Lewis, McLean, Tettey, Emi, Stiepermann, Cantwell, Pukki. Subs: Hanley, Heise, Drmic, Fahrmann, Srbeny, McGovern, Idah. Man City: Ederson, Walker, Stones, Otamendi, Zinchenko, Gundogan, Rodri, Silva, Bernardo Silva, Aguero, Sterling. Subs: Bravo, Gabriel Jesus, De Bruyne, Fernandinho, Mahrez, Joao Cancelo, Foden. Referee: Kevin Friend. Scott Murray is all over the build-up to this one: Now confirmed by official decision-making types. Abraham will do no further scoring, as he\u2019s just gone off to be replaced by Batchuayi. Apparently Rochdale have had 69% of possession at Peterborough, which is quite impressive and must make it really very galling that they\u2019re now 6-0 down. Apparently that Wolves goal might, like three of Chelsea\u2019s, have been scored by Tammy Abraham. GOAL! Wolverhampton Wanderers 1-4 Chelsea (Saiss, 69 mins) A corner from the left is headed behind, and the ensuing corner from the right is headed pretty much straight at Kepa, but firmly enough to get past him anyway! GOAL! Sheffield United 0-1 Southampton (Djenepo, 66 mins) Oooh, hello! The Blades idiotically give the ball away in their own half, but when Djenepo gets it, 50 yards from goal, there is no obvious danger. But he turns, holds off a first challenge, heads towards the box, dances past a couple of very half-hearted attempts to close him down, and then it in nicely! A little over an hour ago I mentioned that Bolton had just scored their first goal in 11 league matches to take the lead at Rotherham. Bolton\u2019s good times didn\u2019t last long: Carlton Morris has just put Rotherham 5-1 up. GOAL! Wolverhampton Wanderers 0-4 Chelsea (Abraham, 56 mins) This is superb goalmanship. The ball is tossed forward to Abraham, who has Coady sticking to him like so much velcro, but the Chelsea forward turns back away from goal, spins round again, tricks his way into space and then slaps the ball inside the far post from 15 yards! Jude Bellingham has just put Birmingham City 1-0 at high-flying Charlton. He was born in 2003. It\u2019s his second goal of the season. Disallowed goal! Sheffield United 0-0 Southampton! A free-kick from the right is sent into the area and bounces through to McBurnie, who nods in at the far post! The Blades celebrate, but then notice the referee has his finger in his ear and is busy chatting to VAR HQ. Turns out half the United team was offside when the ball was played in. As you were. GOAL! Brighton 1-0 Burnley (Maupay, 51 mins) The goalkeeper bowls the ball out to the right, where Burn picks it up and carries it forward with menace. Then he lays it off, Brighton mess about on the right, seem to have wasted their opportunity, and then dink in a cross that Maupay stylishly converts with a scissor kick! Tottenham nearly score 28 seconds into the second half, with a low shot from the edge of the area, but this time Guaita saves. Two substitutions at Molineux, where the home side bring on Patrick Cutrone for Leander Dendoncker, and Chelsea take off Anthony Rudiger, who appeared to twang something just before half-time, for Kurt Zouma. How has it taken me this long to learn the word \u201canpfiff\u201d? Anyway, we\u2019re back under way! If you\u2019re casting about in search of an opinion to have about something, here are a couple of decent ones that you can have for free: It\u2019s half-time, and here are the scores on the doors: Premier League Brighton 0-0 Burnley Manchester United 1-0 Leicester Sheffield United 0-0 Southampton Tottenham Hotspur 4-0 Crystal Palace Wolverhampton 0-3 Chelsea Championship Blackburn 1-0 Millwall Charlton 0-0 Birmingham Hull 2-1 Wigan Middlesbrough 0-0 Reading Preston North End 1-0 Brentford QPR 3-1 Luton Stoke 1-0 Bristol City Swansea 0-0 Nottingham Forest League One Wimbledon 1-0 Shrewsbury Accrington Stanley 1-3 Sunderland Blackpool 0-1 Milton Keynes Dons Burton Albion 0-0 Coventry Gillingham 0-0 Wycombe Ipswich 0-0 Doncaster Lincoln City 0-0 Bristol Rovers Oxford Utd 1-0 Tranmere Peterborough 3-0 Rochdale Rotherham 3-1 Bolton Southend 1-2 Fleetwood Town League Two Crawley Town 0-0 Mansfield Crewe 0-1 Cambridge Utd Exeter 1-1 Leyton Orient Forest Green 1-0 Colchester Northampton 1-0 Newport County Oldham 1-0 Grimsby Port Vale 0-0 Plymouth Salford City 0-1 Cheltenham Scunthorpe 3-0 Morecambe Stevenage 1-1 Carlisle Swindon 2-0 Macclesfield Walsall 0-0 Bradford GOAL! Tottenham 4-0 Crystal Palace (Lamela, 42 mins) I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s going on, defensively speaking, down Palace\u2019s left flank, but the answer appears to be nothing whatsoever. This time Son pokes through to Kane, peeling right from a central position, who from just outside the penalty area crosses to Lamela, who slides in to shoot in off the keeper! GOAL! Wolverhampton Wanderers 0-3 Chelsea (Abraham, 41 mins) Chelsea break at pace. Willian runs down the right, but when his cross is cleared it seems the danger has passed. Instead it\u2019s re-centred, headed limply away again, re-re-centred, and this time Abraham heads it in from the six-yard line! \u201cVardy isn\u2019t pretty. Leicester plays a conservative style. But goals are goals. He hustles, he\u2019s grity, and he is always a threat. That\u2019s great in my mind,\u201d insists Mary Waltz. But there\u2019s a difference between being great, and being a great, isn\u2019t there? GOAL! Wolverhampton Wanderers 0-2 Chelsea (Abraham, 34 mins) Two in three minutes for Chelsea! Wolves try to play the ball out from the back and don\u2019t manage it, the ball being pilfered in the left-back position. It\u2019s played across the field and Tomori is involved again, carrying it forward from the centre circle to the edge of the area. He passes to Mount, who goes down very easily indeed in search of a penalty, but before the referee gets a chance to blow his whistle the ball breaks to Abraham, who in an instant spins and scores! GOAL! Wolverhampton Wanderers 0-1 Chelsea (Tomori, 31 mins) A corner is played short on the right. Chelsea faff about with it for a while and eventually a defender manages to get a toe on the ball, sending it rolling harmlessly infield. But then, from nowhere, Fikayo Tomori runs onto it and, from 30 yards or so, hits a first-time curling beauty that gives Rui Patricio no chance whatsoever! Back to Jamie Vardy, then. \u201cI doubt Vardy would get more respect if he was foreign born,\u201d sniffs Hubert O\u2019Hearn. \u201cI really like him, but I\u2019d put him on a par with Olivier Giroud (albeit different styles). One is beloved, one is \u2018never quite good enough\u2019. I don\u2019t think I need to define which is which.\u201d GOAL! Tottenham 3-0 Crystal Palace (Son Heung-Min, 23 mins) Cowabunga! Tottenham are hitting jackpot in the goal machine today! The ball is played wide to Aurier again. This time he hits a high cross that curls beyond the far post, where Son has been left handily clear to smash a volley into the onion bag with his left peg! GOAL! Tottenham 2-0 Crystal Palace (Van Aanholt OG, 20 mins) More defensive mishaps at White Hart Lane, where the ball is played to Aurier on the right and his low cross flicks off Van Aanholt and bobbles in at the near post! \u201cAny insight into what that Chelsea line-up is supposed to be?\u201d asks Oliver Pattenden. \u201cLooks like it was selected by an Ouija Board.\u201d I believe that Chelsea are playing three at the back, mirroring Wolves\u2019 formation. \u201cCan you please explain VAR to me?\u201d pleads JR. \u201cThe goal Son just scored came directly after a long Alderweireld pass hit him in the arm and the ball fell to his feet. (And don\u2019t get me started on Lascelles taking Matip down by the neck in the early game today).\u201d Of course I can explain VAR. It\u2019s a system that checks that the match officials haven\u2019t failed to spot a variety of misdemeanours, or have erroneously spotted non-existent ones. I must say I didn\u2019t see that handball, but then I am watching five games simultaneously, which essentially means that I\u2019m not watching any matches at all. If it happened, after that Newcastle goal against Watford recently, it would be an inexplicable humiliation. Good and bad news in Stoke\u2019s search for a first win of the season. Sam Clucas put them ahead in the fourth minute, but in the 12th Joe Allen has been sent off! GOAL! Tottenham 1-0 Crystal Palace (Son Heung-min, 10 mins) Palace very nearly take the lead from a left-wing free-kick, eventually hacked clear, and then suddenly Son is bursting into the box from the right onto a long ball, bobbles the ball towards the penalty spot, and then wrongfoots the keeper! That was a one-man demonstration of the art of hopeless defending from Mamadou Sakho, who lost the ball in the air and then bumbled uselessly along in Son\u2019s wake, making no difference to anything. GOAL! Manchester United 1-0 Leicester (Rashford, 8 mins) Coolly converted by Rashford, who sends Schmeichel to his left and the ball to his right! Rashford gets in front of Soyuncu and goes over his leg! It\u2019s not very clear on first viewing who got to the ball first, but if it was Rashford then it\u2019s probably a foul. PENALTY! Manchester United have yet another spot kick (subject to VAR confirmation) \u201cControversial opinion ahoy: should United have sold De Gea in the summer?\u201d wonders Chris Faherty. \u201cHe\u2019s been in bad form for nearly a year, his goalkeeping style may be in question as he ages (he\u2019s nearly thirty now) and he looks to be getting the package Sanchez was on so no savings for us natch. Of the three players that were linked away from us most prominently this summer (Lukaku, Pogba and De Gea) he was the most expendable for my money.\u201d Hmmmm. He may no longer be the best goalkeeper in the country, but he\u2019d be hard to replace. And as I type that he saves excellently from Maddison! GOAL! Rotherham 0-1 Bolton Thibaud Verlinden has scored Bolton\u2019s first goal in 11 league games! SAVE! James cuts inside from the left and is taken down right on the corner of the penalty area. Andreas Pereira takes the free kick and a very fine one it is too, heading to the near top corner before Schmeichel pushed it away. BONG! It\u2019s football o\u2019clock! The players are out and it\u2019s very nearly action time! Unlikely football league fan dept: Popular comic actor Will Ferrell, who went to watch Portsmouth v Tranmere last month, was at Fulham v West Brom today. \u201cLooking through those line-ups (and now Eden Hazard is gone) Jamie Vardy looks like the player most important to his club,\u201d writes Gary Naylor. \u201cI suspect, were he called Jaime Vard\u00e9, he\u2019d be rated a PL great without equivocation. Of course, Jaime Vard\u00e9 is ridiculous in every sense.\u201d He\u2019s a great player, but I think his journey to this point \u2013 when he is indeed a brilliant Premier League match-winner \u2013 is too much a part of who he is for him to be \u201cjust\u201d a PL great. If we\u2019re restricting our judgement to the Premier League, he\u2019s the joint 44th highest scorer in the Premier League (one goal behind Cristiano Ronaldo), which for a pure goalscorer isn\u2019t high enough to make the greatness grade. There are players well ahead of him in the goalscoring chart \u2013 Yakubu Aiyegbeni, say, or Mark Viduka \u2013 who aren\u2019t there either. More blue skies, this time in Florence, where Fiorentina are 25 minutes into their home game against Juventus. It\u2019s currently goalless, the home side buoyed by this lovely lilac display: \u201cAfternoon Simon,\u201d writes occasional volunteer north-of-the-border correspondent Simon McMahon. \u201cIn Scotland, Championship leaders Dundee United travel to Somerset Park to face second place Ayr. Elsewhere, nothing matters.\u201d That sounds very much like a matter of opinion to me. The team news is filtering through, and these are the starting line-ups of all this afternoon\u2019s Premier League games: Brighton v Burnley Brighton: Ryan, Webster, Duffy, Dunk, Burn, Gross, Stephens, Propper, Maupay, Murray, March. Subs: Bong, Bissouma, Mooy, Button, Baluta, Connolly, Alzate. Burnley: Pope, Lowton, Tarkowski, Mee, Pieters, Lennon, Westwood, Cork, McNeil, Barnes, Wood.

Subs: Justin, Morgan, Albrighton, Ward, Barnes, Perez, Praet. Referee: Martin Atkinson. Sheffield United v Southampton Sheff Utd: Henderson, Basham, Egan, O\u2019Connell, Baldock, Lundstram, Norwood, Fleck, Stevens, McGoldrick, McBurnie. Subs: Luke Freeman, Sharp, Robinson, Mousset, Osborn, Moore, Besic. Southampton: Gunn, Yoshida, Vestergaard, Bednarek, Cedric, Romeu, Hojbjerg, Djenepo, Ward-Prowse, Boufal, Adams. Subs: McCarthy, Stephens, Long, Ings, Armstrong, Bertrand, Valery. Referee: Lee Mason. Tottenham Hotspur v Crystal Palace Tottenham Hotspur: Lloris, Aurier, Alderweireld, Vertonghen, Rose, Sissoko, Winks, Lamela, Eriksen, Son, Kane. Subs: Wanyama, Dier, Alli, Gazzaniga, Lucas Moura, Ndombele, Davies. Crystal Palace: Guaita, Ward, Cahill, Sakho, van Aanholt, Townsend, Milivojevic, Kouyate, Schlupp, Zaha, Ayew.

Subs: Barkley, Pedro, Caballero, Zouma, Giroud, Pulisic, Batshuayi. Referee: Graham Scott. Liverpool have just gone 3-1 up against Newcastle with 20 minutes remaining. Here\u2019s a super if not exactly complementary photo of Andy Robertson: It\u2019s an absolutely gorgeous day in London, and I hope wherever you are. Here is some blue sky in Wolverhampton: Well, this looks intriguing. A crackerjack bounty of fixtures including two top-flight matches between members of Ye Olde Big Six and teams who fancy their chances of catching them. \u201cThere are teams that quite rightly will be competing and have ambitions to get in there, so that\u2019s challenging for all of us,\u201d says Frank Lampard, whose Chelsea side visit Wolves. Damn straight. The Football League will no doubt be full of fun, but it lacks a standout bingo fixture. Championship leaders Swansea host Nottingham Forest. With Huddersfield playing Sheffield Wednesday tomorrow, Stoke know they will clamber off the bottom, temporarily at least, if they get something out of their home game against sixth-placed Bristol City. Down in League Two Stevenage, who finished last season with five wins in six unbeaten games, have just dumped their manager after four defeats in seven winless matches and will hope to get back on the point bike against Carlisle. Anyway, it\u2019s about time you had a full run-down of this afternoon\u2019s fixtures in the English Football League and the Scottish Premiership, and that is one dream I can very much make come true. All kick-offs 3pm BST unless stated: Premier League Brighton v Burnley Liverpool v Newcastle (12.30pm) Manchester United v Leicester Norwich v Manchester City (5.30pm) Sheffield United v Southampton Tottenham Hotspur v Crystal Palace Wolverhampton v Chelsea Championship Blackburn v Millwall Charlton v Birmingham Fulham v West Brom (12.30pm) Hull v Wigan Middlesbrough v Reading Preston North End v Brentford QPR v Luton Stoke v Bristol City Swansea v Nottingham Forest League One Wimbledon v Shrewsbury Accrington Stanley v Sunderland Blackpool v Milton Keynes Dons Burton Albion v Coventry Gillingham v Wycombe Ipswich v Doncaster Lincoln City v Bristol Rovers Oxford Utd v Tranmere Peterborough v Rochdale Rotherham v Bolton Southend v Fleetwood Town League Two Crawley Town v Mansfield Crewe v Cambridge Utd Exeter v Leyton Orient Forest Green v Colchester Northampton v Newport County Oldham v Grimsby Port Vale v Plymouth Salford City v Cheltenham Scunthorpe v Morecambe Stevenage v Carlisle Swindon v Macclesfield Walsall v Bradford Scottish Premiership Aberdeen v St Johnstone Hamilton v Celtic (12noon) Hearts v Motherwell Kilmarnock v Hibernian Rangers v Livingston Ross County v St Mirren",

Even though they didn\u2019t have the opportunity or the right to have a public voice or presence, they still made use of the tools they had and of their private spaces, be they letters or diaries.\u201d</p> <p>And that, she adds, is where the real treasures are to be found: \u201cthe sexual and reformist work of Hildegart Rodr\u00edguez; the plans for statewide organisation you get in Pilar Primo de Rivera; and the deeply poetic and profoundly philosophical creative attitude of Carmen Laforet.\u201d</p> <p>Rodr\u00edguez was the self-described \u201ceugenic daughter\u201d of a mother determined to create a superhuman. In letters to her \u201cspiritual father\u201d, the English sexologist <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Havelock_Ellis\" title=\"\">Havelock Ellis</a>, Rodr\u00edguez talks of her belief in the urgent need for family planning while also mentioning her ringlets and a \u201cmummy\u201d who never leaves her alone.</p> <p>Rodr\u00edguez was 18 when her mother killed her in 1933, apparently terrified that her preternaturally gifted child was slipping away from her. \u201cI think if we were American, there would already be three films about her,\u201d says Ortiz.</p> <p>Laforet, who wrote <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/jun/23/featuresreviews.guardianreview31\" title=\"\"><em>Nada</em> (<em>Nothing</em>)</a> \u2013 one of the great Spanish novels of the 20th century \u2013 emerges as an author profoundly and painfully unaware of her own worth: \u201cI remain absolutely convinced that this work of mine does not give or take an ounce of spirituality to or from the world, that it is not important to anyone; and I dedicate myself to it knowing of its many defects, enormous plot holes, and lack of moral purpose.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b92e14f3bb9c40922a4048c89dce991f79c686ce\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b92e14f3bb9c40922a4048c89dce991f79c686ce/77_0_1924_2404/800.jpg\" alt=\"Hildegart Rodr\u00edguez\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hildegart Rodr\u00edguez, who exchanged letters with HG Wells and US birth-control campaigner Margaret Sanger, was 16 when she published a controversial book \u2013 <em>Did Marx Get it Wrong?</em> \u2013 in 1932, a year before her mother shot her dead.

      "bodyText": "Eighty-six years after she was silenced at the age of 18 by four bullets that her mother fired into her sleeping body, Hildegart Rodr\u00edguez \u2013 Spanish prodigy, socialist and pioneering sexual educator \u2013 has found her voice once more. So, too, has the trailblazing writer Carmen Laforet and, more controversially, Pilar Primo de Rivera, daughter of the 1920s Spanish dictator and crusading leader of the women\u2019s section of the Falange movement under Franco, which was led by her brother, Jos\u00e9 Antonio. The trio are the first influential thinkers featured in a new online project that mixes film and literature to recover and preserve the ideas, words and legacies of Spanish and Latin American women whose contributions to culture and society have been overlooked, marginalised or forgotten. Cartasvivas (Livingletters) is the brainchild of the writer and Exeter University academic Nuria Capdevila-Arg\u00fcelles and the award-winning filmmaker Paula Ortiz, who teaches at Barcelona University. By searching archives and examining letters, speeches and interviews, the pair have recovered the intimate thoughts of Rodr\u00edguez, Laforet and Primo de Rivera and put them into the mouths of actors. With the help of their students, who helped produce and subtitle the short films, and the support of the Banco Santander Foundation, the first \u201cfilmic capsules\u201d are now available online for free. The aim, according to Capdevila-Arg\u00fcelles and Ortiz, was to find a tool \u201cto bring the legacy of the past fully into the present\u201d and put it within easy reach of everyone. \u201cWe didn\u2019t come up with the words that the actors have made their own \u2013 they were already written and already there,\u201d says Capdevila-Arg\u00fcelles, who has also worked to ensure Madrid commemorates a lost generation with a series of plaques of female writers, artists, scientists and thinkers silenced under Franco. \u201cThe project is about taking these legacies that are key to understanding our culture, our politics and our history, and putting them very much in the here and now,\u201d said Capdevila-Arg\u00fcelles. Ortiz added: \u201cWhat\u2019s fascinated me from the beginning of all this is that, while women have obviously contributed half of all history and half of all thought, that\u2019s not even close to being reflected in our culture or in the products of our culture. \u201cIt\u2019s just not there, so we have to go looking for it in those hidden places where women\u2019s thoughts, feelings and ideas have always been kept. Even though they didn\u2019t have the opportunity or the right to have a public voice or presence, they still made use of the tools they had and of their private spaces, be they letters or diaries.\u201d And that, she adds, is where the real treasures are to be found: \u201cthe sexual and reformist work of Hildegart Rodr\u00edguez; the plans for statewide organisation you get in Pilar Primo de Rivera; and the deeply poetic and profoundly philosophical creative attitude of Carmen Laforet.\u201d Rodr\u00edguez was the self-described \u201ceugenic daughter\u201d of a mother determined to create a superhuman. In letters to her \u201cspiritual father\u201d, the English sexologist Havelock Ellis, Rodr\u00edguez talks of her belief in the urgent need for family planning while also mentioning her ringlets and a \u201cmummy\u201d who never leaves her alone. Rodr\u00edguez was 18 when her mother killed her in 1933, apparently terrified that her preternaturally gifted child was slipping away from her. \u201cI think if we were American, there would already be three films about her,\u201d says Ortiz. Laforet, who wrote Nada (Nothing) \u2013 one of the great Spanish novels of the 20th century \u2013 emerges as an author profoundly and painfully unaware of her own worth: \u201cI remain absolutely convinced that this work of mine does not give or take an ounce of spirituality to or from the world, that it is not important to anyone; and I dedicate myself to it knowing of its many defects, enormous plot holes, and lack of moral purpose.\u201d Then there is Primo de Rivera. In the film, after railing at those who call her a fascist, she points to the work that the Secci\u00f3n Femenina did to improve infant health and the lot of women in post-civil-war Spain. \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for us, Spanish women would be 40 years behind European women,\u201d she says. \u201cIf the Secci\u00f3n Femenina hadn\u2019t existed, Spanish women would have had nothing, absolutely nothing, only backwardness, ignorance, submission \u2026 and dictatorship.\u201d Primo de Rivera, who died in 1991, is careful to point out that the section was under her command \u2013 not Franco\u2019s \u2013 and that it was, as she puts it, her baby: \u201cI gave birth to it, I raised it, I buried it, and no one else was ever in my position.\u201d She also gives short shrift to what was expected of her as a woman of her era. \u201cI have never been beautiful,\u201d she says, \u201cnor liked wearing makeup or flirting with men. I do not think these necessary in order to feel like a woman. They whispered behind my back; that I looked a mess, that I had not heard of shampoo, that I always dressed as if I were a sexton\u2019s daughter.\u201d Capdevila-Arg\u00fcelles and Ortiz are aware of how the inclusion of Primo de Rivera could be viewed in a Spain struggling to come to terms with its past and to break with the post-Franco pact of forgetting. She lived well into Spain\u2019s post-Franco return to democracy, dying in 1991, and defended her actions and achievements to the end, saying: \u201cNowadays people say that I was authoritarian, reactionary and, first and foremost, a fascist \u2013 as if I had exterminated Jews like Hitler did. They accuse me without wanting to listen \u2026 Accusing someone is very easy and very comfortable because those that accuse are automatically free from blame.\u201d But Capdevila-Arg\u00fcelles and Ortiz are adamant the project is not an exercise in hagiography. \u201cThese pathfinding women were visionaries, but there were also huge paradoxes because it wasn\u2019t easy for any of them to be who they were,\u201d says Capdevila-Arg\u00fcelles. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to show the tensions in their thoughts and in who they were.\u201d",

Maguire played well, winning his personal battle with Jamie Vardy, and Solskj\u00e6r was entitled to feel happy about the commitment of his team. It was certainly one of Andreas Pereira\u2019s better games for the club. Daniel James showed some nice touches and Rashford was always a difficult opponent. United might have provided reminders of their flaws at times but, if nothing else, nobody could doubt their determination.</p> \n<p>In the process Rashford also demonstrated they have not completely forgotten the art of taking a penalty kick. With Paul Pogba among the absentees, at least there was no debate about who should take this one. Both players had missed one in United\u2019s opening fixtures and, in those circumstances, Rashford could probably have been forgiven if he felt slightly apprehensive approaching the ball. He did not give that impression, steering his kick to Kasper Schmeichel\u2019s left as the goalkeeper shaped to go the other way.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/14/liverpool-newcastle-united-premier-league-match-report\">Sadio Man\u00e9 double gives Liverpool comeback win after Newcastle scare</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Anthony Martial\u2019s absence meant Rashford was given a role through the middle. It is the position Gareth Southgate says does not bring out the best in the player but, while there may be something in that argument, it was also Rashford\u2019s alertness in the area that led to the penalty. Caglar Soyuncu did not seem to realise how speedily his opponent was going to get across to the ball and, as soon as Rashford got there ahead of him, it was always likely the attacking player would go over the defender\u2019s trailing foot. The VAR replays confirmed Soyuncu had clipped him and Pereira also deserves a mention for the sliding tackle on Hamza Choudury that turned the ball into the penalty area.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3e90c23359543c9b14bafa222c72fa8c7cef52bc\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e90c23359543c9b14bafa222c72fa8c7cef52bc/0_20_4335_2600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rashford scores from the penalty spot.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rashford scores from the penalty spot.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Will Oliver/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>By that point Schmeichel had already denied Pereira, direct from a free-kick, with a scrambling save beneath his crossbar. James Maddison had a chance to punish United for some poor defending but it took a while before Leicester, having gone behind, started to attack again with the potency that might have been expected. When they did, however, it must have been startling for the United crowd to see how quickly their own players lost momentum. Ben Chilwell\u2019s volley brought a flying save from David de Gea and there was enough danger for the home team to realise a difficult second half lay ahead.</p> \n<p>Sure enough, Leicester started it brightly but, for all their possession, they never found a pass to release Vardy. The onslaught that might have been anticipated in the final 20 minutes never really materialised.

It was certainly one of Andreas Pereira\u2019s better games for the club. Daniel James showed some nice touches and Rashford was always a difficult opponent. United might have provided reminders of their flaws at times but, if nothing else, nobody could doubt their determination. In the process Rashford also demonstrated they have not completely forgotten the art of taking a penalty kick. With Paul Pogba among the absentees, at least there was no debate about who should take this one. Both players had missed one in United\u2019s opening fixtures and, in those circumstances, Rashford could probably have been forgiven if he felt slightly apprehensive approaching the ball. He did not give that impression, steering his kick to Kasper Schmeichel\u2019s left as the goalkeeper shaped to go the other way. Anthony Martial\u2019s absence meant Rashford was given a role through the middle. It is the position Gareth Southgate says does not bring out the best in the player but, while there may be something in that argument, it was also Rashford\u2019s alertness in the area that led to the penalty. Caglar Soyuncu did not seem to realise how speedily his opponent was going to get across to the ball and, as soon as Rashford got there ahead of him, it was always likely the attacking player would go over the defender\u2019s trailing foot. The VAR replays confirmed Soyuncu had clipped him and Pereira also deserves a mention for the sliding tackle on Hamza Choudury that turned the ball into the penalty area. By that point Schmeichel had already denied Pereira, direct from a free-kick, with a scrambling save beneath his crossbar. James Maddison had a chance to punish United for some poor defending but it took a while before Leicester, having gone behind, started to attack again with the potency that might have been expected. When they did, however, it must have been startling for the United crowd to see how quickly their own players lost momentum. Ben Chilwell\u2019s volley brought a flying save from David de Gea and there was enough danger for the home team to realise a difficult second half lay ahead. Sure enough, Leicester started it brightly but, for all their possession, they never found a pass to release Vardy. The onslaught that might have been anticipated in the final 20 minutes never really materialised. Rashford struck the angle of crossbar and post from a free-kick and the afternoon concluded with the Stretford End singing Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s name. \u201cWe want to play better than this,\u201d the manager said. \u201cOf course we want to dominate games but sometimes you play against a team that plays well and I thought we rode out the threat well.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>It was, by all accounts, a furious row. Donald Trump was talking about relaxing sanctions on Iran and holding a summit with its president, Hassan Rouhani, at this month\u2019s UN general assembly in New York. John Bolton, his hawkish national security adviser, was dead against it and forcefully rejected Trump\u2019s ideas during a tense meeting in the Oval Office on Monday.</p> <p>Big mistake. Still angry over the humiliating collapse of his secret <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/08/donald-trump-says-he-was-due-to-host-taliban-at-camp-david\" title=\"\">Camp David weekend summit with the Afghan Taliban</a>, which Bolton had also opposed, Trump was in no mood to listen to his aide\u2019s notoriously hardline views. \u201cI disagreed strongly with him,\u201d he said later. Trump lost his temper \u2013 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/10/trump-fires-john-bolton-national-security-adviser\" title=\"\">Bolton lost his job</a>, summarily dismissed by tweet.</p> <p>Bolton\u2019s brutal defenestration has raised hopes that Trump, who worries that voters may view him as a warmonger, may begin to moderate some of his more confrontational international policies. As the 2020 election looms, he is desperate for a big foreign policy peace-making success. And, in Trump world, winning matters more than ideology, principles or personnel.</p> <p>The US president is now saying he is also open to a repeat meeting with North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, to reboot stalled nuclear disarmament talks. On another front, he has offered an olive branch to China, delaying a planned tariff increase on $250bn of Chinese goods pending renewed trade negotiations next month. Meanwhile, he says, new tariffs on European car imports could be dropped, too.</p> <p>Is a genuine dove-ish shift under way? It seems improbable. Since taking office in January 2017, Trump has not merely broken with diplomatic and geopolitical convention. He has taken a wrecking ball to venerated alliances, multilateral cooperation and the postwar international rules-based order. He has cosied up to autocrats, attacked old friends and blundered into sensitive conflicts he does not fully comprehend.</p> <p>The resulting new world disorder \u2013 to adapt George HW Bush\u2019s famous 1991 phrase \u2013 will be hard to put right. Like its creator, Trump world is unstable, unpredictable and threatening. Trump has been called America\u2019s first rogue president. Whether or not he wins a second term, this Trumpian era of epic disruption, the very worst form of American exceptionalism, is already deeply entrenched.</p> <p>The suggestion that Trump will make nice and back off as election time nears thus elicits considerable scepticism. US analysts and commentators say the president\u2019s erratic, impulsive and egotistic personality means any shift towards conciliation may be short-lived and could quickly be reversed, Bolton or no Bolton.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Trump wanted quick 'n' easy, primetime credit for a dramatic peace deal in Afghanistan with the Taliban, pushed ahead blindly, then changed his mind at the last minute</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Trump is notorious for blowing hot and cold, performing policy zigzags and suddenly changing his mind. \u201cRegardless of who has advised Mr Trump on foreign affairs \u2026 all have proved powerless before [his] zest for chaos,\u201d the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/10/opinion/bolton-fired.html\" title=\"\"><em>New York Times</em> noted last week</a>.</p> <p>Lacking experienced diplomatic and military advisers (he has sacked most of the good ones), surrounded by an inner circle of cynical sycophants such as secretary of state Mike Pompeo, and driven by a chronic desire for re-election, Trump\u2019s behaviour could become more, not less, confrontational during his remaining time in office, suggested Eliot Cohen, professor of strategic studies at Johns Hopkins university.</p> <p>\u201cThe president has proved himself to be what many critics have long accused him of being: belligerent, bullying, impatient, irresponsible, intellectually lazy, short-tempered and self-obsessed,\u201d Cohen wrote <a href=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/long-term-disaster-trump-foreign-policy\" title=\"\">in <em>Foreign Affairs</em> journal</a>. \u201cRemarkably, however, those shortcomings have not yet translated into obvious disaster. But [that] \u2026 should not distract from a building crisis of US foreign policy.\u201d</p> <p>This pending crisis stems from Trump\u2019s crudely Manichaean division of the world into two camps: adversaries/competitors and supporters/customers. A man with few close confidants, Trump has real trouble distinguishing between allies and enemies, friends and foes, and often confuses the two. In Trump world, old rules don\u2019t apply. Alliances are optional. Loyalty is weakness. And trust is fungible.</p> <p>As a result, the US today finds itself at odds with much of the world to an unprecedented and dangerous degree. America, the postwar global saviour, has been widely recast as villain. Nor is this a passing phase. Trump seems to have permanently changed the way the US views the world and vice versa. Whatever follows, it will never be quite the same again.</p> <p>Clues as to what he does next may be found in what he has done so far. His is a truly calamitous record, as exemplified by Afghanistan. Having vowed in 2016 to end America\u2019s longest war, he began with a troop surge, lost interest and sued for peace. A withdrawal deal proved elusive. Meanwhile, US-led forces <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/30/nearly-4000-afghan-civilians-killed-or-wounded-in-first-half-of-2019-un-says\" title=\"\">inflicted record civilian casualties</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cf61a293346a72987284914a45236a4d285c6a99\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cf61a293346a72987284914a45236a4d285c6a99/0_73_4164_2499/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The US and Israeli flags are projected on the walls of Jerusalem\u2019s Old City in May.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The US and Israeli flags are projected on the walls of Jerusalem\u2019s Old City in May, marking the anniversary of the US embassy transfer from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ahmad Gharabli/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The crunch came last weekend when a bizarre, secret <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/08/donald-trump-says-he-was-due-to-host-taliban-at-camp-david\" title=\"\">summit with Taliban chiefs at Camp David was cancelled</a>. It was classic Trump. He wanted quick \u2019n\u2019 easy, primetime credit for a dramatic peace deal, pushed ahead blindly, then changed his mind at the last minute. Furious over a debacle of his own making, he turned his wrath on others, notably Bolton \u2013 who, ironically, had opposed the summit all along.</p> <p>All sides are now vowing to step up the violence, with the insurgents aiming to disrupt this month\u2019s presidential election in Afghanistan. In short, Trump\u2019s self-glorifying Afghan reality show, of which he was the Nobel-winning star, has made matters worse. Much the same is true of his North Korea summitry, where expectations were raised, then dashed when he got <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/28/hanoi-summit-collapse-trump-amateur-hour\" title=\"\">cold feet in Hanoi</a>, provoking a backlash from Pyongyang.</p> <p>The current crisis over Iran\u2019s nuclear programme is almost entirely of Trump\u2019s making, sparked by his decision last year to renege on the 2015 UN-endorsed deal with Tehran. His subsequent \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign of punitive sanctions has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/09/trump-iran-regime-change-resistance\" title=\"\">failed to cow Iranians</a> while alienating European allies. And it has led Iran to resume banned nuclear activities \u2013 a seriously counterproductive, entirely predictable outcome.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s unconditional, unthinking support for Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel\u2019s aggressively rightwing prime minister \u2013 including tacit US backing for his proposed annexation of swathes of the occupied territories \u2013 is pushing the Palestinians back to the brink, energising Hamas and Hezbollah, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/11/arab-leaders-denounce-netanyahu-plan-annex-palestinian-territories-israel\" title=\"\">raising tensions across the region</a>.</p> <p>With Trump\u2019s blessing, Israel is enmeshed in escalating, multi-fronted armed confrontation with Iran and its allies in Iraq, Lebanon and Syria. Add to this recent violence in the Gulf, the disastrous Trump-backed, Saudi-led war in Yemen, mayhem in Syria\u2019s Idlib province, border friction with Turkey, and Islamic State resurgence in northern Iraq, and a region-wide explosion looks ever more likely.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The bipartisan consensus forged in the 1990s \u2013 in which the US towered over the world and, at low cost, sought to remake it in America's image \u2013 has failed and cannot be revived</p> <footer> <cite>Stephen Wertheim, historian</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Yet Trump, oblivious to the point of recklessness, remains determined to unveil his absurdly unbalanced Israel-Palestine \u201cdeal of the century\u201d after Tuesday\u2019s Israeli elections. He and his gormless son-in-law, Jared Kushner, may be the only people who don\u2019t realise their plan has a shorter life expectancy than a snowball on a hot day in Gaza.</p> <p>Another prominent aspect of Trump world is his sinister, personal alliance with Vladimir Putin. There\u2019s no doubt Russia\u2019s president meddled in the 2016 US election to Trump\u2019s benefit, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2019/jul/24/mueller-testimony-live-stream-trump-news-today-russia-obstruction-report-latest-updates-hearing\" title=\"\">as the Mueller report states</a>. There\u2019s no doubt Trump has gone easy on Putin over Crimea and Ukraine, over war crimes and chemical weapons attacks in Syria, over the Salisbury poisonings, and over his vicious assaults on Russia\u2019s democratic opposition. Trump is even pushing for Russia to be readmitted to the G7. Exactly why he acts this way is much less certain.</p> <p>Whether Trump is attacking Nato, insulting Europe\u2019s elected leaders, unhelpfully taking sides on Brexit, ignoring India\u2019s repression in Kashmir, plotting regime change in Venezuela, ignoring egregious human rights abuses from the Philippines to Saudi Arabia, undermining the UN and international law, wrecking nuclear arms control treaties, plundering the Arctic, or opposing efforts to combat climate crisis and environmental degradation, he is consistently out of line, out on his own \u2013 and out of control.</p> <p>This, broadly, is Trump world as it has come to exist since January 2017. And this, in a nutshell, is the intensifying foreign policy crisis of which Professor Cohen warned. The days when responsible, trustworthy, principled US international leadership could be taken for granted are gone. No vague change of tone on North Korea or Iran will by itself halt the Trump-led slide into expanding global conflict and division.</p> <p>Historians such as Stephen Wertheim say change had to come. US politicians of left and right mostly agreed that \u201cthe bipartisan consensus forged in the 1990s \u2013 in which the US towered over the world and, at low cost, sought to remake it in America\u2019s image \u2013 has failed and cannot be revived\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/26/opinion/2020-foreign-policy.html\" title=\"\">Wertheim wrote earlier this year</a>. \u201cBut agreement ends there \u2026 \u201d he continued: \u201cOne camp holds that the US erred by coddling China and Russia, and urges a new competition against these great power rivals. The other camp, which says the US has been too belligerent and ambitious around the world, counsels restraint, not another crusade against grand enemies.\u201d</p> <p>This debate among grownups over America\u2019s future place in the world will form part of next year\u2019s election contest. But before any fundamental change of direction can occur, the international community \u2013 and the US itself \u2013 must first survive another 16 months of Trump world and the wayward child-president\u2019s poll-fixated, ego-driven destructive tendencies.</p> <p>Survival is not guaranteed. The immediate choice facing US friends and foes alike is stark and urgent: ignore, bypass and marginalise Trump \u2013 or actively, openly, resist him.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"954957fa0b0b2165608df344169ebca5cda4f4e2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/954957fa0b0b2165608df344169ebca5cda4f4e2/0_61_1641_984/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump greets Angela Merkel at the G7 summit in France in August.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump greets Angela Merkel at the G7 summit in France in August, but he rarely misses a chance to be negative about Germany or its strong chancellor.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christian Hartmann/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Here are some of the key flashpoints around the globe</p> <h2>United Nations</h2> <p>Trump is deeply hostile to the UN. It embodies the multilateralist, globalist policy approaches he most abhors \u2013 because they supposedly infringe America\u2019s sovereignty and inhibit its freedom of action. Under him, self-interested US behaviour has undermined the authority of the UN security council\u2019s authority. The US has rejected a series of international treaties and agreements, including the Paris climate change accord and the Iran nuclear deal. The UN-backed international criminal court is beyond the pale. Trump\u2019s attitude fits with his \u201cAmerica First\u201d isolationism, which questions traditional ideas about America\u2019s essential global leadership role.</p> <h2>Germany</h2> <p>Trump rarely misses a chance to bash Germany, perhaps because it is Europe\u2019s most successful economy and represents the EU, which he detests. He is obsessed by German car imports, on which protectionist US tariffs will be levied this autumn. He accuses Berlin \u2013 and Europe\u2013 of piggy-backing on America by failing to pay its fair share of Nato defence costs. Special venom is reserved for Germany\u2019s chancellor, Angela Merkel, most likely because she is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jul/11/nato-summit-donald-trump-says-germany-is-captive-of-russians\" title=\"\">a woman who stands up to him</a>. Trump recently insulted another female European leader, Denmark\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/21/trump-state-visit-cancellation-over-greenland-shocks-danes\" title=\"\">Mette Frederiksen, after she refused to sell him Greenland</a>.</p> <h2>Israel</h2> <p>Trump has made a great show of unconditional friendship towards Israel and its rightwing prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who has skilfully maximised his White House influence. But by moving the US embassy to Jerusalem, officially condoning Israel\u2019s annexation of the Golan Heights, and withdrawing funding and other support from the Palestinians, the president has abandoned the long-standing US policy of playing honest broker in the peace process. Trump has also tried to exploit antisemitism for political advantage, accusing US Democrat Jews who oppose Netanyahu\u2019s policies of \u201cdisloyalty\u201d to Israel.</p> <h2>Russia</h2> <p>Trump\u2019s evident liking for Vladimir Putin, Russia\u2019s president, has been the cause of endless puzzlement, given Moscow\u2019s hostility to Nato and the western democratic alliance, its support for Bashar al-Assad and alleged Syrian war crimes, and its illegal intervention in Ukraine. Trump\u2019s attitude may stem from Putin\u2019s meddling in the 2016 US presidential election, which benefited him. But the affinity between them may be better explained by shared autocratic tendencies. Putin is an authoritarian nationalist, like similar rightwing politicians in China, Turkey, Brazil and India whom Trump admires \u2013 and would like to emulate.</p> <h2>China</h2> <p>During his presidential campaign in 2016, Trump provocatively declared China a bigger problem than jihadi terrorism. He claims that China has enjoyed unfair advantages in two-way trade for decades due to its notional designation as a developing country, supposed currency manipulation, and America\u2019s own failure to protect manufacturing industry. He has levelled similar accusations at the EU, Japan, Canada, India and other trading partnersothers. But his remedy \u2013 unilateral punitive tariffs and sanctions \u2013 has disrupted international commerce, shaken global economic confidence and strained political relations with Beijing without demonstrably improving US fortunes.</p> <h2>Venezuela</h2> <p>Trump\u2019s clumsy efforts to engineer regime change in Venezuela and impose a Washington-approved version of democracy mark a regression to the bad old days of the cold war when the US regarded Central and Latin America as its \u201cbackyard\u201d and exclusive sphere of influence. So far, Trump\u2019s attempt, masterminded by John Bolton, to replace the regime of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro with a pro-American technocrat, Juan Guaid\u00f3, has failed miserably. Undeterred, he continues to sanction Maduro\u2019s ideological allies in post-Castro Cuba and to exacerbate the Central American migrant crisis, meanwhile enthusiastically embracing Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil\u2019s president.</p> <h2>Saudi Arabia</h2> <p>Trump made his first overseas trip as president to Saudi Arabia, signalling the importance he attaches to close relations with the energy-rich, autocratic Gulf kingdom. He has since strengthened the alliance in opposition to Iran, deploying troops to Saudi Arabia and supplying advanced weaponry for its war in Yemen. The Saudi connection has also come to symbolise Trump\u2019s indifference to human rights abuses, whether in the Philippines, Russia or on the US-Mexico border. When the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, was murdered by Saudi agents, Trump defended senior figures in Riyadh such as its crown prince who allegedly ordered the killing.</p> <h2>Kashmir</h2> <p>When Imran Khan, Pakistan\u2019s prime minister, visited the White House recently, Trump boasted he was ready to mediate in the long-running dispute over divided Kashmir. It was a vainglorious gesture, reflecting Trump\u2019s ignorance. When, shortly afterwards, India imposed direct rule on Kashmir, effectively detaining its population, Trump did nothing. Whether the issue is the Delhi-Islamabad nuclear standoff, the unending Afghan war, Chinese attempts to gain strategic leverage in Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Myanmar, or the Rohingya refugee tragedy in Bangladesh, Trump\u2019s south Asia policy, like that in sub-Saharan Africa, is ineffectual and near non-existent. Maybe they are lucky. </p>",

      "bodyText": "It was, by all accounts, a furious row. Donald Trump was talking about relaxing sanctions on Iran and holding a summit with its president, Hassan Rouhani, at this month\u2019s UN general assembly in New York. John Bolton, his hawkish national security adviser, was dead against it and forcefully rejected Trump\u2019s ideas during a tense meeting in the Oval Office on Monday. Big mistake. Still angry over the humiliating collapse of his secret Camp David weekend summit with the Afghan Taliban, which Bolton had also opposed, Trump was in no mood to listen to his aide\u2019s notoriously hardline views. \u201cI disagreed strongly with him,\u201d he said later. Trump lost his temper \u2013 and Bolton lost his job, summarily dismissed by tweet. Bolton\u2019s brutal defenestration has raised hopes that Trump, who worries that voters may view him as a warmonger, may begin to moderate some of his more confrontational international policies. As the 2020 election looms, he is desperate for a big foreign policy peace-making success. And, in Trump world, winning matters more than ideology, principles or personnel. The US president is now saying he is also open to a repeat meeting with North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, to reboot stalled nuclear disarmament talks. On another front, he has offered an olive branch to China, delaying a planned tariff increase on $250bn of Chinese goods pending renewed trade negotiations next month. Meanwhile, he says, new tariffs on European car imports could be dropped, too. Is a genuine dove-ish shift under way? It seems improbable. Since taking office in January 2017, Trump has not merely broken with diplomatic and geopolitical convention. He has taken a wrecking ball to venerated alliances, multilateral cooperation and the postwar international rules-based order. He has cosied up to autocrats, attacked old friends and blundered into sensitive conflicts he does not fully comprehend. The resulting new world disorder \u2013 to adapt George HW Bush\u2019s famous 1991 phrase \u2013 will be hard to put right. Like its creator, Trump world is unstable, unpredictable and threatening. Trump has been called America\u2019s first rogue president. Whether or not he wins a second term, this Trumpian era of epic disruption, the very worst form of American exceptionalism, is already deeply entrenched. The suggestion that Trump will make nice and back off as election time nears thus elicits considerable scepticism. US analysts and commentators say the president\u2019s erratic, impulsive and egotistic personality means any shift towards conciliation may be short-lived and could quickly be reversed, Bolton or no Bolton. Trump is notorious for blowing hot and cold, performing policy zigzags and suddenly changing his mind. \u201cRegardless of who has advised Mr Trump on foreign affairs \u2026 all have proved powerless before [his] zest for chaos,\u201d the New York Times noted last week. Lacking experienced diplomatic and military advisers (he has sacked most of the good ones), surrounded by an inner circle of cynical sycophants such as secretary of state Mike Pompeo, and driven by a chronic desire for re-election, Trump\u2019s behaviour could become more, not less, confrontational during his remaining time in office, suggested Eliot Cohen, professor of strategic studies at Johns Hopkins university. \u201cThe president has proved himself to be what many critics have long accused him of being: belligerent, bullying, impatient, irresponsible, intellectually lazy, short-tempered and self-obsessed,\u201d Cohen wrote in Foreign Affairs journal. \u201cRemarkably, however, those shortcomings have not yet translated into obvious disaster. But [that] \u2026 should not distract from a building crisis of US foreign policy.\u201d This pending crisis stems from Trump\u2019s crudely Manichaean division of the world into two camps: adversaries/competitors and supporters/customers. A man with few close confidants, Trump has real trouble distinguishing between allies and enemies, friends and foes, and often confuses the two. In Trump world, old rules don\u2019t apply. Alliances are optional. Loyalty is weakness. And trust is fungible. As a result, the US today finds itself at odds with much of the world to an unprecedented and dangerous degree. America, the postwar global saviour, has been widely recast as villain. Nor is this a passing phase. Trump seems to have permanently changed the way the US views the world and vice versa. Whatever follows, it will never be quite the same again. Clues as to what he does next may be found in what he has done so far. His is a truly calamitous record, as exemplified by Afghanistan. Having vowed in 2016 to end America\u2019s longest war, he began with a troop surge, lost interest and sued for peace. A withdrawal deal proved elusive. Meanwhile, US-led forces inflicted record civilian casualties. The crunch came last weekend when a bizarre, secret summit with Taliban chiefs at Camp David was cancelled. It was classic Trump. He wanted quick \u2019n\u2019 easy, primetime credit for a dramatic peace deal, pushed ahead blindly, then changed his mind at the last minute. Furious over a debacle of his own making, he turned his wrath on others, notably Bolton \u2013 who, ironically, had opposed the summit all along. All sides are now vowing to step up the violence, with the insurgents aiming to disrupt this month\u2019s presidential election in Afghanistan. In short, Trump\u2019s self-glorifying Afghan reality show, of which he was the Nobel-winning star, has made matters worse. Much the same is true of his North Korea summitry, where expectations were raised, then dashed when he got cold feet in Hanoi, provoking a backlash from Pyongyang. The current crisis over Iran\u2019s nuclear programme is almost entirely of Trump\u2019s making, sparked by his decision last year to renege on the 2015 UN-endorsed deal with Tehran. His subsequent \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign of punitive sanctions has failed to cow Iranians while alienating European allies. And it has led Iran to resume banned nuclear activities \u2013 a seriously counterproductive, entirely predictable outcome. Trump\u2019s unconditional, unthinking support for Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel\u2019s aggressively rightwing prime minister \u2013 including tacit US backing for his proposed annexation of swathes of the occupied territories \u2013 is pushing the Palestinians back to the brink, energising Hamas and Hezbollah, and raising tensions across the region. With Trump\u2019s blessing, Israel is enmeshed in escalating, multi-fronted armed confrontation with Iran and its allies in Iraq, Lebanon and Syria. Add to this recent violence in the Gulf, the disastrous Trump-backed, Saudi-led war in Yemen, mayhem in Syria\u2019s Idlib province, border friction with Turkey, and Islamic State resurgence in northern Iraq, and a region-wide explosion looks ever more likely. Yet Trump, oblivious to the point of recklessness, remains determined to unveil his absurdly unbalanced Israel-Palestine \u201cdeal of the century\u201d after Tuesday\u2019s Israeli elections. He and his gormless son-in-law, Jared Kushner, may be the only people who don\u2019t realise their plan has a shorter life expectancy than a snowball on a hot day in Gaza. Another prominent aspect of Trump world is his sinister, personal alliance with Vladimir Putin. There\u2019s no doubt Russia\u2019s president meddled in the 2016 US election to Trump\u2019s benefit, as the Mueller report states. There\u2019s no doubt Trump has gone easy on Putin over Crimea and Ukraine, over war crimes and chemical weapons attacks in Syria, over the Salisbury poisonings, and over his vicious assaults on Russia\u2019s democratic opposition. Trump is even pushing for Russia to be readmitted to the G7. Exactly why he acts this way is much less certain. Whether Trump is attacking Nato, insulting Europe\u2019s elected leaders, unhelpfully taking sides on Brexit, ignoring India\u2019s repression in Kashmir, plotting regime change in Venezuela, ignoring egregious human rights abuses from the Philippines to Saudi Arabia, undermining the UN and international law, wrecking nuclear arms control treaties, plundering the Arctic, or opposing efforts to combat climate crisis and environmental degradation, he is consistently out of line, out on his own \u2013 and out of control. This, broadly, is Trump world as it has come to exist since January 2017. And this, in a nutshell, is the intensifying foreign policy crisis of which Professor Cohen warned.

It is a world leader in research, generates \u00a320bn in export revenues and is credited with playing a big part in raising the productivity of the UK\u2019s workforce during a period of rapid expansion in the 1990s and 2000s.</p> <p>So successful have universities been in attracting students \u2013 even in the teeth of a huge rise in course fees \u2013 that they have managed to paper over deep cracks in their finances.</p> <p>One of the deepest cracks is in the academics\u2019 pension fund, the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS). Despite a yawning gap in the fund\u2019s assets compared with its liabilities \u2013 a deficit of more than \u00a320bn at the last count on liabilities of \u00a387bn \u2013 the university lecturers\u2019 union, the UCU, began to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/sep/04/rising-contributions-reduced-benefits-university-pensions\" title=\"\">ballot 52,000 members of the scheme </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/sep/04/rising-contributions-reduced-benefits-university-pensions\" title=\"\">on taking strike action</a> this term to prevent the scheme\u2019s trustees from hiking contribution rates.</p> <p>An increase in pension contributions is an effective pay cut, and the scheme trustees have planned three over just 12 months.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s university sector is a jewel in the nation\u2019s crown. It is a world leader in research, generates \u00a320bn in export revenues and is credited with playing a big part in raising the productivity of the UK\u2019s workforce during a period of rapid expansion in the 1990s and 2000s. So successful have universities been in attracting students \u2013 even in the teeth of a huge rise in course fees \u2013 that they have managed to paper over deep cracks in their finances. One of the deepest cracks is in the academics\u2019 pension fund, the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS). Despite a yawning gap in the fund\u2019s assets compared with its liabilities \u2013 a deficit of more than \u00a320bn at the last count on liabilities of \u00a387bn \u2013 the university lecturers\u2019 union, the UCU, began to ballot 52,000 members of the scheme on taking strike action this term to prevent the scheme\u2019s trustees from hiking contribution rates. An increase in pension contributions is an effective pay cut, and the scheme trustees have planned three over just 12 months. The first was in April and the second and third were due in October and next April, until university employers agreed to defer them while talks take place with an independent body. Why, you might ask, has the union pressed ahead with a ballot when the employers have already agreed to discuss alternative ways forward and put planned contribution increases on hold? Surely it would be madness to have a second year of strikes, denying students teaching time when they have paid through the nose, and when it is clear the fund is in deep trouble? The union says the deficit calculations made by those who run and regulate pension schemes are exaggerated. In fact, it maintains, the entire structure of the university sector should be transformed so staff get higher pay, long-term contracts and shorter working weeks as well as cheaper pensions. Criticism of the USS scheme comes directly from the top of the UCU and its new general secretary, Jo Grady. Before taking up the post last May she was a lecturer in employment relations. Backed by her master\u2019s degree on the causes of the pensions crisis and a PhD on the effects of pension disputes, Grady believes the final salary schemes Britain was famed for in the 1990s could and should have been saved. USS pensions are no longer based on final salary but on career average salary. Almost every final salary scheme has over the past 25 years shut down or at least closed to new members, after admitting that rising life expectancy and falling investment returns meant they were unaffordable. Grady wants to make a last stand. This will be possible only if the trustees do two things. First, they must tell the universities to pay much more into the fund; second, they must take a trip to the pensions equivalent of Las Vegas with the majority of the scheme\u2019s \u00a364bn of assets placed on stock market bets. Sadly, after Theresa May\u2019s cap on foreign student numbers and seven years of almost flat student fees, many universities are in dire financial straits, so won\u2019t be amenable to the first idea. And as for the second, placing bets directly on corporate stocks is not a risk the pensions regulator is willing to take. Universities reported surpluses in excess of \u00a32bn in 2016, but as with local authorities, these sums are in response to austerity and the threat of worse to come, not a disguised slush fund. Academics can say they have already made sacrifices. Like their cousins in schools and local government, USS pensions are no longer based on final salary. And members with salaries of more than \u00a357,000 are obliged to put any extra contributions into a scheme that relies on investment returns, much like those offered by most employers. Thousands of university employees have found themselves on zero-hour contracts and with little or no benefits as the universities\u2019 scramble to survive has followed the traditional British management route of short-term thinking and crude cost-cutting.

The government is behind the regulator, and the regulator, after a series of pension fund crashes, puts prudence first. If academics want a fight, they should be tackling the plight of their younger colleagues.

Formats (digital, analogue), types of connectivity (wired, wireless), concerns about obsolescence and issues with making all your bits, new and old, work together: it all needs consideration. Here, we show you how to build a capable sound system and update your listening experience for the 21st century.</p> <h2>For the telly addict</h2> <p>As TVs have got slimmer, and the space for built-in speakers has become smaller, so the need for a bit of help in the sound department has become necessary. Even the most expensive televisions benefit from the addition of a soundbar, to ensure the audio performance is as cinematic as the picture.</p> <p>The good news is that a decent soundbar can double as a pretty impressive sound system. Most of them will incorporate Bluetooth playback, so you can stream directly from a tablet or smartphone, but an increasing number of people are using their TV as the source, thanks to apps such as YouTube and Spotify, which are available via smart TV systems.</p> <p>Yamaha make some of the best soundbars. The <em><strong><a href=\"https://uk.yamaha.com/en/products/audio_visual/sound_bar/musiccast_bar_400/index.html\" title=\"\">MusicCast BAR 400</a></strong></em> (\u00a3449, pictured above) is a 2.1 channel system with an included wireless subwoofer that\u2019s great for movies, but it also includes plenty of features aimed specifically at music playback.</p> <p>The MusicCast label means it is compatible with Yamaha\u2019s growing multi-room setup, while AirPlay 2, Spotify Connect and direct access to streaming services Deezer, Tidal and Qobuz via the remote app give you many different ways to play your tunes. There\u2019s also support for hi-res 24-bit/192kHz playback, meaning audiophile-grade music collections will feel at home here too. <br><em><strong>Total: </strong></em><em><strong>\u00a3449</strong></em></p> <h2>For the commuter</h2> <p>While dedicated portable audio players have their place for those who want the very best sound on the go, all but the most discerning of audiophiles will be using the powerful device that already sits in their pockets \u2013 their smartphone.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"182b9c9819665d040e279dfaf683c7abcbfbd2af\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/182b9c9819665d040e279dfaf683c7abcbfbd2af/420_0_1080_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Audiolab M-DAC Nano.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Audiolab M-DAC Nano.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: audiolab</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But what lets down a smartphone from a sound perspective compared with a dedicated device is usually its circuitry, specifically its DAC \u2013 or digital-to-analogue \u2013 converter. This is something you will find in any digital device that deals with sound. Ultimately, it changes a digital signal that can\u2019t be heard into an analogue soundwave that can. The better the DAC, the better quality the sound.</p> <p>That\u2019s why it is often a good idea to bypass the DAC in your device and use a standalone one instead. The pocket-size <em><strong><a href=\"http://audiolab.co.uk/product-detail.php?pid=26\" title=\"\">Audiolab M-DAC Nano</a></strong></em> (\u00a3149) is a superb entry-level option and adds extra convenience by being wireless. This means you plug your headphones directly into its 3.5mm jack but connect to your device via high-quality Bluetooth.</p> <p>Team it with a pair of wired headphones such as the excellent <em><strong><a href=\"https://en-uk.sennheiser.com/momentum-m2\" title=\"\">Sennheiser Momentum 2</a></strong></em> (\u00a399, pictured above) and you\u2019ll hear your music instantly clearer, cleaner and more expressive, with more punch and power than you\u2019d get from your device directly. Perfect for helping you switch off from your commute. <br><em><strong>Total: </strong></em><em><strong>\u00a32</strong></em><em><strong>48</strong></em></p> <h2>For the upcycler</h2> <p>If you\u2019re attached to an older hi-fi system, there is no need to bin it just so you can introduce more modern functionality to your setup.</p> <p>The <em><strong><a href=\"https://www.bluesound.com/products/powernode/\" title=\"\">Bluesound </a></strong></em><em><strong><a href=\"https://www.bluesound.com/products/powernode/\" title=\"\">Node 2i</a></strong></em> (\u00a3499, pictured above) can do all that for you in a single box and is hands down the most talented streamer you\u2019ll find for under \u00a3500. Just connect it to your existing stereo receiver using a pair of phono cables and it will instantly breathe new life into an older system with a plethora of new playback options.</p> <p>Alongside a digital input, a USB port and an excellent headphone stage for private listening, there is also built-in aptX HD Bluetooth, AirPlay 2 and of course wifi, which will give your legacy kit access to internet radio stations, streaming services and any music that\u2019s stored on your home network.</p> <p>It also makes it instantly compatible with the Bluesound high-resolution, multi-room system, plus there\u2019s an Alexa facility for introducing voice commands.</p> <p>In addition to allowing you to stream music through your cherished old hi-fi, the Node has a DAC that may well outperform the one in your CD player, meaning your old discs will sound better than they did before. <br><em><strong>Total: </strong></em><em><strong>\u00a3499</strong></em></p> <h2>For the desktop DJ</h2> <p>Laptops are popular music sources for both home and office setups, whether for playing back music that has been ripped from CDs or downloaded from iTunes or is being streamed from Spotify.</p> <p>Built-in laptop speakers aren\u2019t cut out to deliver any of the detail or nuance, so supplanting them with a decent pair of active speakers is a quick and easy way of improving your desktop setup.</p> <p>Active speakers have built-in amplification, so don\u2019t require a separate stereo receiver to power them, as you would have in a traditional hi-fi setup. They usually plug into the source using a 3.5mm input but some, such as the <em><strong><a href=\"https://www.ruarkaudio.com/products/mr1-bluetooth-speaker-system\" title=\"\">Ruark MR1 Mk</a></strong></em><em><strong><a href=\"https://www.ruarkaudio.com/products/mr1-bluetooth-speaker-system\" title=\"\">2</a></strong></em> (\u00a3330, pictured above), offer an optical input for 24-bit/192kHz support too.</p> <p>Whichever way you connect them, they sound fantastic. This is hi-fi grade audio from a category that, only a few years ago, wouldn\u2019t have come close.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"adbfcddc6cfe9045abfeeda5230c4f6d4a621ba2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/adbfcddc6cfe9045abfeeda5230c4f6d4a621ba2/0_53_1163_698/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Audioquest Dragonfly Red.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Audioquest Dragonfly Red.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Audioquest Dragonfly Red</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If all you do to your desktop setup is buy a pair of Ruarks, your music will sound instantly better. However, team them with the <em><strong><a href=\"https://www.audioquest.com/dacs/dragonfly/dragonfly-red\" title=\"\">Audioquest Dragon</a></strong></em><em><strong><a href=\"https://www.audioquest.com/dacs/dragonfly/dragonfly-red\" title=\"\">Fly Red</a></strong></em> (\u00a3169) USB DAC and you\u2019ll add a further layer of sophistication, subtlety and solidity to your music \u2013 plus you can also use it to enhance your headphone experience. <br><em><strong>Total: \u00a349</strong></em><em><strong>9</strong></em></p> <h2>For the streamer</h2> <p>Music streaming services have made owning music surplus to requirement for many people. Making one monthly payment for unlimited access to a whole world of music makes a lot of financial sense for people who have eclectic tastes, not to mention limited space for storing the physical alternative. Plus, it\u2019s great for music discovery.</p> <p>This kind of music ownership lends itself to an audio setup such as that offered by streaming pioneer Sonos, which allows you to tap into all of your services in one place and play them back reliably and in good quality, all around the home.</p> <p>While you don\u2019t have to buy more than one speaker, the fun really starts when you do. The control app is easy to use and helps you get a multi-room system up and running in a matter of minutes. You can keep adding to it as your budget allows, with a whole family of speakers and soundbars to suit every room of the house.</p> <p>The <em><strong>Sonos One</strong></em> is a fantastic little speaker to get you started (<a href=\"https://www.sonos.com/en-gb/shop/2-room-music-system-one.html\" title=\"\">\u00a3398 for a two-room bundle</a>, pictured above), offering rich, spacious sound for a small speaker. It also offers voice control with both Alexa and Google Assistant support built in. <br><em><strong>Total: </strong></em><em><strong>\u00a3398</strong></em></p> <h2>For the vinyl buff</h2> <p>With interest in vinyl well and truly revived, buying a system to play it on has undergone a renaissance. The popular briefcase-style record players might look the part, but with poor quality built-in speakers and none of the adjustment options that will protect your vinyl from damage, you won\u2019t be doing your record collection any favours.</p> <p>For a setup that will do the analogue sound justice, you\u2019ll want to build a system of traditional hi-fi separates. The <em><strong><a href=\"https://www.project-audio.com/en/product/primary-e/\" title=\"\">Pro-Ject Primary E</a></strong></em> (\u00a3145, pictured above) is a fantastic entry-level deck from a respected turntable manufacturer and although its design is pretty plain, its sound is anything but.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"88a691a8d9ddd170ef83fd88119207202fad9320\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/88a691a8d9ddd170ef83fd88119207202fad9320/0_104_1200_449/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Onkyo A-9010.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"374\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Onkyo A-9010.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Onkyo A-9010</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Team it with the <em><strong><a href=\"https://www.uk.onkyo.com/en/products/a-9010-uk-122163.html\" title=\"\">Onkyo A-9010</a></strong></em> stereo amplifier (\u00a3199) and the <em><strong><a href=\"http://www.mission.co.uk/lx-series/lx-2/\" title=\"\">Mission LX-2</a></strong></em> bookshelf speakers (\u00a3149) and you\u2019ll have a system that\u2019s not short of energy or clarity.</p> <p>The LX-2s are a couple of years old now, but there are few budget speakers that can match them for refinement and musicality, offering punch and unshakable poise in equal measure.</p> <p>The A-9010 will bring the best out of a budget setup like this, but is equally at home with pricier kit too, should you look to upgrade at any stage. <br><em><strong>Total: \u00a3493</strong></em></p>",

The MusicCast BAR 400 (\u00a3449, pictured above) is a 2.1 channel system with an included wireless subwoofer that\u2019s great for movies, but it also includes plenty of features aimed specifically at music playback. The MusicCast label means it is compatible with Yamaha\u2019s growing multi-room setup, while AirPlay 2, Spotify Connect and direct access to streaming services Deezer, Tidal and Qobuz via the remote app give you many different ways to play your tunes. There\u2019s also support for hi-res 24-bit/192kHz playback, meaning audiophile-grade music collections will feel at home here too. Total: \u00a3449 For the commuter While dedicated portable audio players have their place for those who want the very best sound on the go, all but the most discerning of audiophiles will be using the powerful device that already sits in their pockets \u2013 their smartphone. But what lets down a smartphone from a sound perspective compared with a dedicated device is usually its circuitry, specifically its DAC \u2013 or digital-to-analogue \u2013 converter. This is something you will find in any digital device that deals with sound. Ultimately, it changes a digital signal that can\u2019t be heard into an analogue soundwave that can. The better the DAC, the better quality the sound. That\u2019s why it is often a good idea to bypass the DAC in your device and use a standalone one instead. The pocket-size Audiolab M-DAC Nano (\u00a3149) is a superb entry-level option and adds extra convenience by being wireless. This means you plug your headphones directly into its 3.5mm jack but connect to your device via high-quality Bluetooth. Team it with a pair of wired headphones such as the excellent Sennheiser Momentum 2 (\u00a399, pictured above) and you\u2019ll hear your music instantly clearer, cleaner and more expressive, with more punch and power than you\u2019d get from your device directly. Perfect for helping you switch off from your commute. Total: \u00a3248 For the upcycler If you\u2019re attached to an older hi-fi system, there is no need to bin it just so you can introduce more modern functionality to your setup. The Bluesound Node 2i (\u00a3499, pictured above) can do all that for you in a single box and is hands down the most talented streamer you\u2019ll find for under \u00a3500. Just connect it to your existing stereo receiver using a pair of phono cables and it will instantly breathe new life into an older system with a plethora of new playback options. Alongside a digital input, a USB port and an excellent headphone stage for private listening, there is also built-in aptX HD Bluetooth, AirPlay 2 and of course wifi, which will give your legacy kit access to internet radio stations, streaming services and any music that\u2019s stored on your home network. It also makes it instantly compatible with the Bluesound high-resolution, multi-room system, plus there\u2019s an Alexa facility for introducing voice commands. In addition to allowing you to stream music through your cherished old hi-fi, the Node has a DAC that may well outperform the one in your CD player, meaning your old discs will sound better than they did before. Total: \u00a3499 For the desktop DJ Laptops are popular music sources for both home and office setups, whether for playing back music that has been ripped from CDs or downloaded from iTunes or is being streamed from Spotify. Built-in laptop speakers aren\u2019t cut out to deliver any of the detail or nuance, so supplanting them with a decent pair of active speakers is a quick and easy way of improving your desktop setup. Active speakers have built-in amplification, so don\u2019t require a separate stereo receiver to power them, as you would have in a traditional hi-fi setup. They usually plug into the source using a 3.5mm input but some, such as the Ruark MR1 Mk2 (\u00a3330, pictured above), offer an optical input for 24-bit/192kHz support too. Whichever way you connect them, they sound fantastic. This is hi-fi grade audio from a category that, only a few years ago, wouldn\u2019t have come close. If all you do to your desktop setup is buy a pair of Ruarks, your music will sound instantly better. However, team them with the Audioquest DragonFly Red (\u00a3169) USB DAC and you\u2019ll add a further layer of sophistication, subtlety and solidity to your music \u2013 plus you can also use it to enhance your headphone experience. Total: \u00a3499 For the streamer Music streaming services have made owning music surplus to requirement for many people. Making one monthly payment for unlimited access to a whole world of music makes a lot of financial sense for people who have eclectic tastes, not to mention limited space for storing the physical alternative. Plus, it\u2019s great for music discovery. This kind of music ownership lends itself to an audio setup such as that offered by streaming pioneer Sonos, which allows you to tap into all of your services in one place and play them back reliably and in good quality, all around the home. While you don\u2019t have to buy more than one speaker, the fun really starts when you do. The control app is easy to use and helps you get a multi-room system up and running in a matter of minutes. You can keep adding to it as your budget allows, with a whole family of speakers and soundbars to suit every room of the house. The Sonos One is a fantastic little speaker to get you started (\u00a3398 for a two-room bundle, pictured above), offering rich, spacious sound for a small speaker. It also offers voice control with both Alexa and Google Assistant support built in. Total: \u00a3398 For the vinyl buff With interest in vinyl well and truly revived, buying a system to play it on has undergone a renaissance. The popular briefcase-style record players might look the part, but with poor quality built-in speakers and none of the adjustment options that will protect your vinyl from damage, you won\u2019t be doing your record collection any favours. For a setup that will do the analogue sound justice, you\u2019ll want to build a system of traditional hi-fi separates. The Pro-Ject Primary E (\u00a3145, pictured above) is a fantastic entry-level deck from a respected turntable manufacturer and although its design is pretty plain, its sound is anything but. Team it with the Onkyo A-9010 stereo amplifier (\u00a3199) and the Mission LX-2 bookshelf speakers (\u00a3149) and you\u2019ll have a system that\u2019s not short of energy or clarity. The LX-2s are a couple of years old now, but there are few budget speakers that can match them for refinement and musicality, offering punch and unshakable poise in equal measure. The A-9010 will bring the best out of a budget setup like this, but is equally at home with pricier kit too, should you look to upgrade at any stage. Total: \u00a3493",

      "body": "<p>When I arrive at the block of flats where artist Mark Leckey lives, he\u2019s leaning over the walkway balcony, shouting down to the photographer. His six-month-old baby has only just settled and Leckey is reluctant to do the interview and pictures in his flat in case of waking her up. So he comes down to us.</p> <p>It\u2019s a bit drizzly. Leckey strides around the children\u2019s playground in the centre of the flats, in sunglasses and a big, belted overcoat. He looks piratical, with his beard and long hair and single pearl earring, or like a jumble-sale 17th century nobleman. Other residents peer at him, unbothered; one has a chat as she passes. She overhears Leckey telling the photographer that he\u2019s from Ellesmere Port, near Liverpool. \u201cMy parents are from there!\u201d she says, dragging a kid\u2019s bike along. \u201cWe need to talk!\u201d \u201cWe do!\u201d says Leckey.</p> <p>Photos done, Leckey and I tramp the streets, searching for an interview-friendly cafe. Leckey lives on Caledonian Road, just north of King\u2019s Cross in London, and we have a choice: old-school caffs, corporate chains, new vegan efforts. We walk 10 minutes to one of the latter and, as we do, we talk of now and then. Now: children (he has two with his art curator wife), and how London is changing, shiny hipsterism slotted next to longstanding grottiness. Then: what living within the grottiness was like.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There has to be a belief that art has this power, this charisma, this potency</p> <footer> <cite>Mark Leckey</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In the 1990s, Leckey lived in Brixton, south London. He wasn\u2019t at all happy, but he makes it sound fun. He and his friends squatted in a house and the landlord let them stay. But then the landlord decided to build a car park in the basement (of a modest terraced home) and they had to live around that. \u201cIt\u2019s hard cooking when there\u2019s no kitchen floor, so you\u2019re one floor down from the cooker,\u201d says Leckey. He puts his hands above his head, acts it out. He\u2019s funny.</p> <p>Later, I realise that this mixture of past and present is very much part of Leckey\u2019s art. His work is hard to categorise (he gets bored doing the same type of art over and over), but he often remembers his previous life and uses technology to bring those recollections into now \u2013 not shiny and new, but dragging emotional detritus and strangers\u2019 videos and \u201cdid this actually happen?\u201d with them. His first successful video work, <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dS2McPYzEE\" title=\"\">Fiorucci Made Me Hardcore</a></em>, made at the end of the 90s, used found footage of 1970s northern soul dancers, 1980s casuals and 1990s ravers. At the time, much was made of the video\u2019s historical connection, of how the English working class have long sought refuge in nightlife and dancing, but what stayed with me was the video\u2019s spookiness. It was eerie, uneasy, mournful. The camera froze on faces, wound back, showed them again. It was a bit scary.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dS2McPYzEE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-dS2McPYzEE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dS2McPYzEE\">Fiorucci Made Me Hardcore.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>I mention this and Leckey agrees. \u201cI always think of <em>Fiorucci</em> as a ghost film,\u201d he says. \u201cI was thinking the other day about how <em>Fiorucci</em> was made in the same year as <em>Blair Witch</em> <em>Project</em>, with the same technology. I started it in 1997, because it was only then that you could get desktop computers that were strong enough to run video editing software. That work is about memory and also what happens when these experiences have been recorded and then they\u2019re played back.\u201d</p> <p>Leckey has a major show coming up at Tate Britain, which feels like an acknowledgement. Over the years his career has stopped and started, taking in music (he was in bands including donAtelier), comics (he once made art about the Drunken Bakers in <em>Viz</em>) and film (he was professor of film studies at Frankfurt\u2019s St\u00e4delschule). He won the Turner prize in 2008, with work that included a lecture about film and video, as well as a piece that used photo slides and made them into a 3D representation of his old flat. \u201cI want to transform my world and make it more of itself,\u201d he said. He\u2019s not a household name, but Leckey has plenty of admirers of his wonky, real-unreal art.</p> <p>In 2016, another of Leckey\u2019s videos, <em><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/144790614\" title=\"\">Dream English Kid 1964-1999AD</a></em>, won the Tiger short film award at the Rotterdam film festival. <em>Dream English Kid</em> was triggered by his memories of seeing Joy Division at a matinee performance in Liverpool, when he was in his early teens. On the internet, more than 30 years later, he stumbled across some audio of the concert and wondered if he could hear himself in the crowd. Impossible, obviously, but it was a kick-off point; he made a half-hour film about his life from birth until 35 \u2013 \u201cmy memoirs\u201d \u2013 but only using footage that he found online. \u201cI have a knack for looking for stuff,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m good at it, I always have been; I\u2019m one of those people that can find things.\u201d</p> <p>In <em>Dream English Kid</em>, a motorway bridge kept reappearing. This was the bridge that was at the end of Leckey\u2019s garden when he was growing up in Eastham, also near Liverpool (his family moved to Ellesmere Port when he was nine). He and his friends used to mooch about under the concretestructure, eat sweets, mess around, with the M53 thundering over their heads: \u201cEveryone going somewhere. And you\u2019re static, you\u2019re stuck.\u201d There wasn\u2019t much to do. Once, he and his sister, aged eight and six, were chased by a gang of skinheads.</p> <p>He\u2019s recreating that bridge for the Tate show. One of the galleries will be taken over by the grey struts and slab underside of the motorway, revealing the space beneath, so that walking into the room will make you feel a bit like young Leckey did, hanging out, waiting for something to happen. \u201cIt\u2019s like a theatre set,\u201d he tells me. As with many Leckey works, there will be sound. He\u2019s written a script, which he\u2019s got children to speak, and then other children to act out. He\u2019s editing the spoken part down so that the recording becomes more like music. The video will play and the voices will come out of a 16-channel surround sound system. \u201cThe bridge will be generating all this noise.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eec0c3cb86208c7fa8f2cc4d413962349668b8f2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eec0c3cb86208c7fa8f2cc4d413962349668b8f2/0_0_4465_2678/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Eastham Rake motorway bridge, recreated in Dream English Kid, 1964\u20131999AD.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Eastham Rake motorway bridge, recreated in Dream English Kid, 1964\u20131999AD.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Leckey</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Art-spotters will notice that Leckey has used this bridge before. In<em> Dream\u2026</em>, it was a motif to represent time passing. But in the Tate show, which is called O\u2019 Magic Power of Bleakness, it\u2019s telling a far stranger story.</p> <p>When Leckey was 20, he went back to college to take his O-levels (he\u2019d dropped out of school at 15). As part of his English study, he had to write a composition about childhood and he wrote about a \u201csupernatural encounter\u201d he had underneath the motorway bridge. He and his friends, all around eight years old, used to sit at the top of the concrete slope, on a ledge just beneath the motorway.

Casuals were working-class lads (called Perry boys in Manchester) who loved football, fighting and brilliant sportswear. Leckey was a casual until he was 19.</p> <p>Now he regrets it, but he also recognises that there weren\u2019t many options. \u201cIt was either be a casual or get beaten up by casuals,\u201d he says. He didn\u2019t fight much, himself \u2013 \u201cI was too pretty\u201d \u2013 but he got into trouble with the police and went to court a couple of times for stuff he didn\u2019t do. \u201cIt was a waste of time,\u201d he says now. \u201cI wish I\u2019d been strong enough to be a geek.\u201d</p> <p>He moved away from this life when his mum\u2019s new husband, a self-educated docker, took him aside. He stood Leckey in the lounge and said: \u201cEverything in here, somebody drew it before it was made.\u201d And something clicked. Leckey went to college, got his exams and ended up at art college in Newcastle. The summer before he went, he went to work in Brighton and landed slap bang in the 1988 Zap rave scene. He loved it. But when he arrived at Newcastle only one other student, a girl, had been raving too. He would sit in Rockshots nightclub, turning his nose up at the rare groove tracks until the DJ played Black Box. Then he and the one other raver would get up and go mad until the track ended.</p> <p>This unease with others, this inability to fit in and find his post-casual crew, followed him down to London, where he moved in 1990. Though he had some initial success \u2013 his work was shown at the influential New Contemporaries show \u2013 London was soon in thrall to the YBAs (Young British Artists) and Leckey felt like \u201csome rube from the sticks, very provincial\u201d. These days, he sees that his difficulties were partly class-based: very few of the new art crew were working-class northerners, especially not ex-casuals. He was in a club of one. Leckey struggled with depression, partly induced by a serotonin depletion from too much raving. He got money through odd jobs. He took part in police lineups at Brixton police station. He was a cycle courier. He sold jelly sandals on a stall at Portobello Market.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://vimeo.com/144790614\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"338\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/144790614?app_id=122963\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/144790614\">Dream English Kid 1964-1999AD.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>\u201cReally,\u201d he says now \u2013 we\u2019re walking around the streets again \u2013 \u201cI think I just didn\u2019t get lucky. You need luck in London or you\u2019re fucked.\u201d</p> <p>He left and went to the US and in New York his luck turned. He met Gavin Brown, still his US gallerist today, and with his support made headway in the States until <em>Fiorucci</em> made his name in the UK.</p> <p>Is he surprised that he didn\u2019t stick with music rather than art? \u201cWell, I still love music,\u201d he says. \u201cI listen to all sorts and I still make music and I have a monthly show on <a href=\"https://www.nts.live/shows/mark-leckey\" title=\"\">NTS Radio</a>. I\u2019m obsessed with this particular sound, at the minute, a tape hiss R&amp;B sound\u2026 But art has enabled me. Art has more purchase on my life just now.\u201d</p> <p>Leckey has become, over the years, thoroughly enmeshed with the art scene. \u201cYes,\u201d he says, \u201cI\u2019m in the art world. You don\u2019t necessarily have to be, as an artist, you can be slightly removed from it, but I like it. I like the discourse around it and the gossip, I like a bit of that. I like the measure of it, the way it measures the contemporary. You\u2019ll see something and you go, \u2018That\u2019s it, that\u2019s now, that\u2019s this moment, you\u2019ve found that.\u2019 I like that.\u201d</p> <p>But he has his reservations. He remembers the 90s excitement around art \u2013 \u201cIt suddenly went from twee to sexy. There was an energy, a terrific energy, to it. And I aspired to that\u201d \u2013 but now he feels that it\u2019s losing its way.</p> <p>\u201cThe contradictions that it managed to sustain, it can\u2019t sustain those any more,\u201d he says. He\u2019s talking about art\u2019s relationship to money. \u201cIts relationships, its sponsorship. Also the narrowness of its demographic.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be ungrateful,\u201d he says. \u201cBut with art, the better you do, the closer you get to power and it gets more corrupt. More morally unsavoury. It\u2019s moved too close to dirty money, dirty power. Who\u2019s engaged with it, who\u2019s buying it\u2026 When I went to art school, I was trained in the idea of becoming this, like\u2026 sovereign being, right? Answerable to no one, almost Ayn Randian. And that seems\u2026 not right.\u201d</p> <p>We\u2019ve walked the long way round, back to the Caledonian Road. Traffic rumbles. Leckey says goodbye at the tube station and makes his way home, to sit in front of his computer and edit what he finds, sampling and cutting and moving around; using technology to create something new and old, remembered and imagined and un-ordinary. Something with the potential for magic.</p> <p><em>O\u2019 Magic Power of Bleakness is at <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/press/press-releases/mark-leckey-o-magic-power-bleakness\" title=\"\">Tate Britain 24 September to 5 January 2020</a></em></p> <ul> <li><p>This article was corrected on 16 September. \u201cImminence\u201d should have read \u201cimmanence\u201d</p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "When I arrive at the block of flats where artist Mark Leckey lives, he\u2019s leaning over the walkway balcony, shouting down to the photographer. His six-month-old baby has only just settled and Leckey is reluctant to do the interview and pictures in his flat in case of waking her up. So he comes down to us. It\u2019s a bit drizzly. Leckey strides around the children\u2019s playground in the centre of the flats, in sunglasses and a big, belted overcoat. He looks piratical, with his beard and long hair and single pearl earring, or like a jumble-sale 17th century nobleman. Other residents peer at him, unbothered; one has a chat as she passes. She overhears Leckey telling the photographer that he\u2019s from Ellesmere Port, near Liverpool. \u201cMy parents are from there!\u201d she says, dragging a kid\u2019s bike along. \u201cWe need to talk!\u201d \u201cWe do!\u201d says Leckey. Photos done, Leckey and I tramp the streets, searching for an interview-friendly cafe. Leckey lives on Caledonian Road, just north of King\u2019s Cross in London, and we have a choice: old-school caffs, corporate chains, new vegan efforts. We walk 10 minutes to one of the latter and, as we do, we talk of now and then. Now: children (he has two with his art curator wife), and how London is changing, shiny hipsterism slotted next to longstanding grottiness. Then: what living within the grottiness was like. In the 1990s, Leckey lived in Brixton, south London. He wasn\u2019t at all happy, but he makes it sound fun. He and his friends squatted in a house and the landlord let them stay. But then the landlord decided to build a car park in the basement (of a modest terraced home) and they had to live around that. \u201cIt\u2019s hard cooking when there\u2019s no kitchen floor, so you\u2019re one floor down from the cooker,\u201d says Leckey. He puts his hands above his head, acts it out. He\u2019s funny. Later, I realise that this mixture of past and present is very much part of Leckey\u2019s art. His work is hard to categorise (he gets bored doing the same type of art over and over), but he often remembers his previous life and uses technology to bring those recollections into now \u2013 not shiny and new, but dragging emotional detritus and strangers\u2019 videos and \u201cdid this actually happen?\u201d with them. His first successful video work, Fiorucci Made Me Hardcore, made at the end of the 90s, used found footage of 1970s northern soul dancers, 1980s casuals and 1990s ravers. At the time, much was made of the video\u2019s historical connection, of how the English working class have long sought refuge in nightlife and dancing, but what stayed with me was the video\u2019s spookiness. It was eerie, uneasy, mournful. The camera froze on faces, wound back, showed them again. It was a bit scary. I mention this and Leckey agrees. \u201cI always think of Fiorucci as a ghost film,\u201d he says. \u201cI was thinking the other day about how Fiorucci was made in the same year as Blair Witch Project, with the same technology. I started it in 1997, because it was only then that you could get desktop computers that were strong enough to run video editing software. That work is about memory and also what happens when these experiences have been recorded and then they\u2019re played back.\u201d Leckey has a major show coming up at Tate Britain, which feels like an acknowledgement. Over the years his career has stopped and started, taking in music (he was in bands including donAtelier), comics (he once made art about the Drunken Bakers in Viz) and film (he was professor of film studies at Frankfurt\u2019s St\u00e4delschule). He won the Turner prize in 2008, with work that included a lecture about film and video, as well as a piece that used photo slides and made them into a 3D representation of his old flat. \u201cI want to transform my world and make it more of itself,\u201d he said. He\u2019s not a household name, but Leckey has plenty of admirers of his wonky, real-unreal art. In 2016, another of Leckey\u2019s videos, Dream English Kid 1964-1999AD, won the Tiger short film award at the Rotterdam film festival. Dream English Kid was triggered by his memories of seeing Joy Division at a matinee performance in Liverpool, when he was in his early teens. On the internet, more than 30 years later, he stumbled across some audio of the concert and wondered if he could hear himself in the crowd. Impossible, obviously, but it was a kick-off point; he made a half-hour film about his life from birth until 35 \u2013 \u201cmy memoirs\u201d \u2013 but only using footage that he found online. \u201cI have a knack for looking for stuff,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m good at it, I always have been; I\u2019m one of those people that can find things.\u201d In Dream English Kid, a motorway bridge kept reappearing. This was the bridge that was at the end of Leckey\u2019s garden when he was growing up in Eastham, also near Liverpool (his family moved to Ellesmere Port when he was nine). He and his friends used to mooch about under the concretestructure, eat sweets, mess around, with the M53 thundering over their heads: \u201cEveryone going somewhere. And you\u2019re static, you\u2019re stuck.\u201d There wasn\u2019t much to do. Once, he and his sister, aged eight and six, were chased by a gang of skinheads. He\u2019s recreating that bridge for the Tate show. One of the galleries will be taken over by the grey struts and slab underside of the motorway, revealing the space beneath, so that walking into the room will make you feel a bit like young Leckey did, hanging out, waiting for something to happen. \u201cIt\u2019s like a theatre set,\u201d he tells me. As with many Leckey works, there will be sound. He\u2019s written a script, which he\u2019s got children to speak, and then other children to act out. He\u2019s editing the spoken part down so that the recording becomes more like music. The video will play and the voices will come out of a 16-channel surround sound system. \u201cThe bridge will be generating all this noise.\u201d Art-spotters will notice that Leckey has used this bridge before. In Dream\u2026, it was a motif to represent time passing. But in the Tate show, which is called O\u2019 Magic Power of Bleakness, it\u2019s telling a far stranger story. When Leckey was 20, he went back to college to take his O-levels (he\u2019d dropped out of school at 15). As part of his English study, he had to write a composition about childhood and he wrote about a \u201csupernatural encounter\u201d he had underneath the motorway bridge. He and his friends, all around eight years old, used to sit at the top of the concrete slope, on a ledge just beneath the motorway. And one time he saw an elf. \u201cOr a fairy, or a pixie, or something\u2026,\u201d he says. \u201cIt appeared and it kind of giggled at me.\u201d Actually, Leckey\u2019s told this fairy story so many times, he says, that the remembering of it has become mixed up in the actual event, in the way that anecdotes overlay the truth or a photograph erodes your mind\u2019s-eye view. \u201cBut I can still feel an energy when I think about it,\u201d he says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t malign, but it was mocking. And I just became obsessed by that encounter. This bridge was this entity, a sort of municipal entity, that hosted this supernatural experience.\u201d His older daughter \u2013 she\u2019s eight, the same age he was when he saw the fairy \u2013 is really into fairies at the moment, so that\u2019s a factor, too. I ask him about the script that the kids act out. It\u2019s about a changeling, he says, and it uses the cliches of an urban drama to tell the tale: \u201cAt the end, there\u2019s this supernatural riot.\u201d Leckey likes the combination of the fairy\u2019s other-world magic and the bridge\u2019s real-world engineering. He relates it to being into acid house and hardcore when he was younger. \u201cThere\u2019s something about being lost in music,\u201d he says, \u201cwhich seems organic and wonderful, whereas the idea of being lost in technology is more gridded and rational. It\u2019s more disturbing. But it\u2019s when the two come together that I\u2019ve had the most ecstatic experience. Like acid house and that really rigid 303 repetitive bassline. The deeply inauthentic can actually bring true joy. It\u2019s why I make music as well as art, because music is where I\u2019ve experienced that feeling the most. And that\u2019s why I use technology as well.\u201d Now that he doesn\u2019t go dancing any more, he accesses that intense experience in other ways. Sometimes from making art: \u201cThe reason to make work\u2026 no, not the reason, but the power I get from it, is that when I\u2019m editing I get lost in it. I get consumed and that\u2019s what I want.\u201d He used to get a mad rush from running: \u201cI don\u2019t do it any more, but about 10 years ago there was a period when I used to run and start laughing like a maniac. And singing. I\u2019d be running along, singing.

Transcendence is above, immanence is within. And you\u2019re in it. When I\u2019d run, I\u2019d feel like the world would come rushing in on me and it was completely overwhelming.\u201d I wonder if people who come to the exhibition, who stand under his motorway bridge, will have such an experience. \u201cWell, I want you to be taken into an altered state,\u201d he says. \u201cIf people got lost too, that would be magic.\u201d If all this is making him sound a little hippy-esque, that\u2019s not really what Leckey\u2019s about.

He didn\u2019t fight much, himself \u2013 \u201cI was too pretty\u201d \u2013 but he got into trouble with the police and went to court a couple of times for stuff he didn\u2019t do. \u201cIt was a waste of time,\u201d he says now. \u201cI wish I\u2019d been strong enough to be a geek.\u201d He moved away from this life when his mum\u2019s new husband, a self-educated docker, took him aside. He stood Leckey in the lounge and said: \u201cEverything in here, somebody drew it before it was made.\u201d And something clicked. Leckey went to college, got his exams and ended up at art college in Newcastle. The summer before he went, he went to work in Brighton and landed slap bang in the 1988 Zap rave scene. He loved it. But when he arrived at Newcastle only one other student, a girl, had been raving too. He would sit in Rockshots nightclub, turning his nose up at the rare groove tracks until the DJ played Black Box. Then he and the one other raver would get up and go mad until the track ended. This unease with others, this inability to fit in and find his post-casual crew, followed him down to London, where he moved in 1990. Though he had some initial success \u2013 his work was shown at the influential New Contemporaries show \u2013 London was soon in thrall to the YBAs (Young British Artists) and Leckey felt like \u201csome rube from the sticks, very provincial\u201d. These days, he sees that his difficulties were partly class-based: very few of the new art crew were working-class northerners, especially not ex-casuals. He was in a club of one. Leckey struggled with depression, partly induced by a serotonin depletion from too much raving. He got money through odd jobs. He took part in police lineups at Brixton police station. He was a cycle courier. He sold jelly sandals on a stall at Portobello Market. \u201cReally,\u201d he says now \u2013 we\u2019re walking around the streets again \u2013 \u201cI think I just didn\u2019t get lucky. You need luck in London or you\u2019re fucked.\u201d He left and went to the US and in New York his luck turned. He met Gavin Brown, still his US gallerist today, and with his support made headway in the States until Fiorucci made his name in the UK. Is he surprised that he didn\u2019t stick with music rather than art? \u201cWell, I still love music,\u201d he says. \u201cI listen to all sorts and I still make music and I have a monthly show on NTS Radio. I\u2019m obsessed with this particular sound, at the minute, a tape hiss R&amp;B sound\u2026 But art has enabled me. Art has more purchase on my life just now.\u201d Leckey has become, over the years, thoroughly enmeshed with the art scene. \u201cYes,\u201d he says, \u201cI\u2019m in the art world. You don\u2019t necessarily have to be, as an artist, you can be slightly removed from it, but I like it. I like the discourse around it and the gossip, I like a bit of that. I like the measure of it, the way it measures the contemporary. You\u2019ll see something and you go, \u2018That\u2019s it, that\u2019s now, that\u2019s this moment, you\u2019ve found that.\u2019 I like that.\u201d But he has his reservations. He remembers the 90s excitement around art \u2013 \u201cIt suddenly went from twee to sexy. There was an energy, a terrific energy, to it. And I aspired to that\u201d \u2013 but now he feels that it\u2019s losing its way. \u201cThe contradictions that it managed to sustain, it can\u2019t sustain those any more,\u201d he says. He\u2019s talking about art\u2019s relationship to money. \u201cIts relationships, its sponsorship. Also the narrowness of its demographic.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want to be ungrateful,\u201d he says. \u201cBut with art, the better you do, the closer you get to power and it gets more corrupt. More morally unsavoury. It\u2019s moved too close to dirty money, dirty power. Who\u2019s engaged with it, who\u2019s buying it\u2026 When I went to art school, I was trained in the idea of becoming this, like\u2026 sovereign being, right? Answerable to no one, almost Ayn Randian. And that seems\u2026 not right.\u201d We\u2019ve walked the long way round, back to the Caledonian Road. Traffic rumbles. Leckey says goodbye at the tube station and makes his way home, to sit in front of his computer and edit what he finds, sampling and cutting and moving around; using technology to create something new and old, remembered and imagined and un-ordinary. Something with the potential for magic.

Councils across England have made \u00a32.4m of cuts to specialist drug and alcohol misuse services for children and young people this year. Spending is falling from \u00a340.9m to \u00a338.5m as part of steps taken by local authorities to cope with a \u00a372m Whitehall cut to their public health grant. The disclosure prompted warnings that highly vulnerable children with complex addiction problems are being denied the treatment they need at a time when under-18 drug use is rising. Labour, which uncovered the figures from analysis of government documents, said the downward trend was shameful and would prove a damaging false economy in the long-term. \u201cWhen we are facing growing addiction problems in society, to be cutting children\u2019s specialist drink and drug services is both shameful and utterly counterproductive, potentially condemning the next generation to serious problems in the future\u201d, said John Ashworth, the shadow health and social care secretary.

      "bodyText": "The Republican party has taken \u201ca wrong turn\u201d under Donald Trump, according to three GOP challengers to the president, and is heading down the road to totalitarianism as states cancel primaries in an attempt to give Trump an unimpeded path to the nomination in 2020. In a joint opinion column for the Washington Post, Mark Sanford, Joe Walsh and Bill Weld noted that \u201cthe Democratic primary challengers are still engaged in a heated competition of debates, caucuses and primaries to give their voters in every corner of our country a chance to select the best nominee\u201d. They asked: \u201cDo Republicans really want to be the party with a nominating process that more resembles Russia or China than our American tradition?\u201d Sanford, a former South Carolina congressman and governor, and Walsh, a Tea Party congressman from Illinois turned talk radio host, recently joined Weld, a former governor of Massachusetts, in seeking to offer a Republican alternative to Trump. Pending any legal challenges, they will not be able to do so in Arizona, Nevada, Kansas and South Carolina, which have cancelled their nominating contests. \u201cA president always defines his or her party,\u201d the three men wrote, \u201cand today the Republican party has taken a wrong turn, led by a serial self-promoter who has abandoned the bedrock principles of the GOP. \u201cIn the Trump era, personal responsibility, fiscal sanity and rule of law have been overtaken by a preference for alienating our allies while embracing terrorists and dictators, attacking the free press and pitting everyday Americans against one another. \u201cNo surprise, then, that the latest disgrace, courtesy of Team Trump, is an effort to eliminate any threats to the president\u2019s political power in 2020.\u201d Republican presidents have been damaged by primary challenges before. In 1992, the paleo-conservative Pat Buchanan ran against George HW Bush before the president lost the White House to Bill Clinton. But no sitting president has been denied his party\u2019s nomination since Chester A Arthur in 1884. The current challengers do not stand much chance of upsetting or even minorly damaging Trump. He has treated them with his usual disdain, exaggerating his (admittedly very high) popularity among Republicans, coining a customary nickname \u2013 \u201cThe Three Stooges\u201d \u2013 and homing in on his challengers\u2019 weaknesses. While governor of South Carolina, Sanford said he was absent from the state because he was hiking the Appalachian trail. In fact he was in Argentina, conducting an extra-marital affair. Walsh, who won office in the Tea Party wave of 2010 but lost it in 2012, has apologised for voicing racist opinions about Barack Obama. Weld, a relatively liberal Republican, was governor of Massachusetts between 1991 and 1997, has never held national office and was running mate to the Libertarian candidate, Gary Johnson, in 2016, winning a little more than 3% of the popular vote. Nonetheless, the three men press on. In March, Weld told the Guardian: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, George HW Bush\u2019s numbers were at 91% in December 1991, and look what happened to him.\u201d For the Post, he, Walsh and Sanford wrote: \u201cUnder this president, the meaning of truth has been challenged as never before. Under this president, the federal deficit has topped the $1tn mark. \u201cDo we as Republicans accept all this as inevitable? Are we to leave it to the Democrats to make the case for principles and values that, a few years ago, every Republican would have agreed formed the foundations of our party?\u201d They concluded: \u201cIn the United States, citizens choose their leaders. The primary nomination process is the only opportunity for Republicans to have a voice in deciding who will represent our party. Let those voices be heard.\u201d",

We needed 25 minutes to really arrive in the game. They scored a wonderful goal, and were a big threat always. And then we changed the rhythm and it was immediately much better. We could have scored more but it is all good. I am really happy. We had to find the rhythm, but that\u2019s the main challenge after an international break. We don\u2019t want to leave Bobby Firmino out, but sometimes we have to be sensible and do it. Divock Origi has twisted his ankle but it is not too serious.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d7cedfb8f08f9df5bdd4555\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-14T13:43:24.200Z\">2.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Steve Bruce talks.</strong> \u201cThey are very, very good. They\u2019re a threat. That\u2019s why they are champions of Europe. The disappointment for me was the second goal, you can\u2019t make mistakes like we did. We lost it cheaply in the middle of the park. Perhaps the goalkeeper should have claimed it. Thankfully we stuck at it, and showed plenty of resilience. We had a big chance at 2-1, and if that had gone in, it might have been a different story. Firmino made a big difference when he came on, he is a brilliant player. We\u2019ve played Arsenal, Spurs and Liverpool, and we\u2019ve given a decent account of ourselves in all of those games.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d7cea5b8f08f9df5bdd4548\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-14T13:29:36.151Z\">2.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Virgil van Dijk speaks to BT Sport.</strong> \u201cObviously it was very important to get the three points. It was tough to break them down. To be 1-0 down here is not good, but we reacted the right way. We needed to be organised. Roberto Firmino is a very important player for all of us. He is making life difficult for any defender in the world. He is so good, and I am very happy that he plays for my team.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Georginio Wijnaldum adds: </strong>\u201cWe were lucky that a goal came quick after. It was still difficult after that. Even when we were 2-1 up, they still created chances for 2-2.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d7ce9978f08f30dc5bbb4b1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-14T13:25:34.406Z\">2.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The bright side for Newcastle? </strong>OK, they were outplayed over the piece. But their performance in the first half hour was extremely impressive; they carved out a couple of chances that, on another day, could have turned this match in a different direction; and their resolute refusal to buckle defensively, under extreme pressure applied by one of the best attacks in Europe, bodes well for the battles ahead. They\u2019ve got four points after five games and are currently in 16th spot.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d7ce94d8f0834740f3bb293\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-14T13:22:25.144Z\">2.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">FULL TIME: Liverpool 3-1 Newcastle United</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And there goes the whistle. Liverpool started sluggishly, and Jetro Willems put Newcastle ahead with an absolute screamer. But by the end of it, the league leaders were in total command. Sadio Mane was typically magnificent, scoring twice. Roberto Firmino pulled strings in the Brazilian style. And Mo Salah was quiet, yet still scored a lovely goal. Liverpool go five clear at the top, having won their 14th successive Premier League match, though of course Manchester City can cut that lead to two later this afternoon at Norwich.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a0e8d6cf1b39bc5d7b06254bee4d271369037a89\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a0e8d6cf1b39bc5d7b06254bee4d271369037a89/0_0_3216_2143/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp congratulates\u2019 Sadio Mane on his performance.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp congratulates\u2019 Sadio Mane on his performance.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Ellis/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-14T13:38:34.642Z\">at 2.38pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d7ce8c98f0834740f3bb28c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-14T13:21:08.967Z\">2.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>90 min +2:</strong> Newcastle finally enjoy a bit of possession, but of course it\u2019s far too late.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d7ce86a8f08f30dc5bbb4ac\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-14T13:18:59.188Z\">2.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>90 min:</strong> There will be three added minutes.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d7ce82e8f08f30dc5bbb4ab\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-14T13:17:24.849Z\">2.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>88 min: </strong>Shaqiri flicks Firmino free down the right.

And since the heady April 1996 evening when Stan Collymore sent Kevin Keegan slumping over the hoardings in despair, Newcastle United have taken many other painful beatings at Anfield: another 4-3, one 4-2, five 3-0s and a 4-0 last Christmas. Oh Stan, what did you start.</p> <p><strong>There\u2019s also the small matter of Liverpool\u2019s club-record 13-match winning run in the Premier League. </strong>With Mo Salah and Sadio Mane fully rested during international fortnight, they\u2019re extremely short-priced favourites to win this lunchtime.

      "bodyText": "And that, my good people, is your lot. Thanks for reading this MBM report. Now why not enjoy Andy Hunter\u2019s Anfield verdict? Jurgen Klopp\u2019s verdict. \u201cWe had a tough job to do. We needed 25 minutes to really arrive in the game. They scored a wonderful goal, and were a big threat always. And then we changed the rhythm and it was immediately much better. We could have scored more but it is all good. I am really happy. We had to find the rhythm, but that\u2019s the main challenge after an international break. We don\u2019t want to leave Bobby Firmino out, but sometimes we have to be sensible and do it. Divock Origi has twisted his ankle but it is not too serious.\u201d Steve Bruce talks. \u201cThey are very, very good. They\u2019re a threat. That\u2019s why they are champions of Europe. The disappointment for me was the second goal, you can\u2019t make mistakes like we did. We lost it cheaply in the middle of the park. Perhaps the goalkeeper should have claimed it. Thankfully we stuck at it, and showed plenty of resilience. We had a big chance at 2-1, and if that had gone in, it might have been a different story. Firmino made a big difference when he came on, he is a brilliant player. We\u2019ve played Arsenal, Spurs and Liverpool, and we\u2019ve given a decent account of ourselves in all of those games.\u201d Virgil van Dijk speaks to BT Sport. \u201cObviously it was very important to get the three points. It was tough to break them down. To be 1-0 down here is not good, but we reacted the right way. We needed to be organised. Roberto Firmino is a very important player for all of us. He is making life difficult for any defender in the world. He is so good, and I am very happy that he plays for my team.\u201d Georginio Wijnaldum adds: \u201cWe were lucky that a goal came quick after. It was still difficult after that. Even when we were 2-1 up, they still created chances for 2-2.\u201d The bright side for Newcastle? OK, they were outplayed over the piece. But their performance in the first half hour was extremely impressive; they carved out a couple of chances that, on another day, could have turned this match in a different direction; and their resolute refusal to buckle defensively, under extreme pressure applied by one of the best attacks in Europe, bodes well for the battles ahead. They\u2019ve got four points after five games and are currently in 16th spot. And there goes the whistle. Liverpool started sluggishly, and Jetro Willems put Newcastle ahead with an absolute screamer. But by the end of it, the league leaders were in total command. Sadio Mane was typically magnificent, scoring twice. Roberto Firmino pulled strings in the Brazilian style. And Mo Salah was quiet, yet still scored a lovely goal. Liverpool go five clear at the top, having won their 14th successive Premier League match, though of course Manchester City can cut that lead to two later this afternoon at Norwich. 90 min +2: Newcastle finally enjoy a bit of possession, but of course it\u2019s far too late. 90 min: There will be three added minutes. 88 min: Shaqiri flicks Firmino free down the right. Firmino rolls a pass across the face of goal for Mane, who taps into an unguarded net. But it\u2019s not to be his hat-trick goal, because Firmino has quite rightly been flagged for offside. 87 min: Another cute flick on the edge of the Newcastle box by Firmino, this time down the inside-right channel. And it\u2019s not clear how neither Salah nor Alexander-Arnold were able to score. Dubravka made himself big, we know this much. But someone in Liverpool red surely had to force that home. Firmino has been quite excellent since he came on. 85 min: Salah\u2019s work earns a corner out on the right. Nothing comes of it. Right now, Newcastle appear happy enough to limit the damage. Should they somehow carve out a goal on the break, though, we could have a grandstand finish yet. 84 min: Here comes the Power Cube! Shaqiri - whose last goal came in this fixture last year on Boxing Day - replaces Wijnaldum. 82 min: Firmino busies himself down the right and feeds Alexander-Arnold, who wins a corner off Dummett. The full back takes the set piece himself and finds Mane, who flicks on at the near post to nobody in particular. If nothing else, that was unselfish, given he\u2019s on a hat-trick. 81 min: Liverpool continue to calmly stroke it around the middle of the park. 79 min: Schar is down again. And so is Hayden. It looks like the latter is OK to continue; not so the Swiss international. He\u2019s replaced by Fernandez. 77 min: Liverpool pass it around the middle in the game-management style. \u201cGod what skill on the attack,\u201d writes Mary Waltz. \u201cThrilling to watch Liverpool when they are humming on all cylinders.\u201d 75 min: It\u2019s been a mixed bag from Oxlade-Chamberlain today. But after a year out, he\u2019ll need time to find his feet again, and that\u2019s another 75 minutes in the bank. He\u2019s replaced by Milner. 74 min: Schar requires a bit of treatment having just been skinned by Salah. He might have pulled something while stretching in vain ... though it looks like he\u2019ll be good to continue. Nope. Salah picks up possession 35 yards out, down the inside-right channel, then drifts inside. He feeds Firmino who, with his back to goal on the edge of the box, cutely flicks a return for Salah down the inside left. Salah takes a touch inside the box past Schar, draws Dubravka, and clips the ball into the bottom right. What a goal that was! 71 min: It\u2019s attack versus defence. Can Newcastle hold out for 20 minutes? 69 min: Hayden clips Mane\u2019s ankles out on the right. A free kick, and a chance for Liverpool to load the box. Alexander-Arnold hoicks it long. Van Dijk rises at the far post and heads the ball across goal. Lascelles does well to intercept and clear. 67 min: Newcastle make a double change. Almiron and Krafth are replaced by Muto and former Liverpool defender Manquillo. 65 min: Newcastle can\u2019t get out. Oxlade-Chamberlain has a shot that\u2019s well parried by Dubravka. Firmino can\u2019t quite latch onto the rebound. The Toon survive again. Right now, a third Liverpool goal looks merely a matter of time. But tales like this have been told a hundred times before. Can Newcastle supply a twist? 63 min: Firmino gently scoops a pass down the inside-left channel to release Robertson into the box. Robertson powers goalwards from a tight angle and forces the ball past Dubravka. Somehow the ball takes a deflection that sends it across the face of goal and out on the right for a corner. How did that stay out?! The resulting corner isn\u2019t all that. But Liverpool are really cranking up the pressure now. 62 min: A lung-bursting drive by Robertson gets the crowd going. The ball eventually ends up with Firmino, just to the left of the box. He slips a pass inside for Salah, whose first-time sidefoot is easily blocked by Lascelles. 61 min: Alexander-Arnold crosses deep from the right. Firmino glances a header towards the bottom right but it\u2019s an easy collect for Dubravka. 59 min: Liverpool are beginning to press Newcastle back again. It\u2019s all happening in the visitors\u2019 final third. Mane works some space down the left with an elaborate dragback, but then slices a cross into the stand. 57 min: But Liverpool soon win another, Alexander-Arnold\u2019s right-wing cross forcing Schar to head over from close range. The corner\u2019s met by Matip, an increasing menace at set pieces these days. But there\u2019s no power on Matip\u2019s header this time. 56 min: This is much better from Oxlade-Chamberlain, who releases Alexander-Arnold into space down the right. The full-back hammers a low shot towards the near post, but it\u2019s deflected over for a corner. Nothing comes of the set piece. 54 min: Newcastle should be level. Atsu drops a shoulder to ease himself past Oxlade-Chamberlain down the left. That was too easy. Oxlade-Chamberlain isn\u2019t at the races today. A lot of misplaced passes and now this. Atsu crosses deep for Krafth ... who is free on the penalty spot! He must at least hit the target, but leans back and balloons high into the Kop. Yep, this game remains in the balance all right. 52 min: Liverpool break four on two. Oxlade-Chamberlain\u2019s clunker of a pass lets Newcastle off the hook. Anfield groans. There are a few nerves crackling around the old place. This game remains in the balance. 50 min: Salah - who\u2019d take him off?! - nearly releases Oxlade-Chamberlain on goal with a delicious Barnesesque backheel. Not quite. Elsewhere, Schar launches into an impetuous two-footed lunge on Mane. Fortunately it\u2019s a bit half-hearted, plus Mane leaps elegantly out of the road. But that could have been ugly. No action is taken, though to be fair, nobody\u2019s complaining. 49 min: Liverpool nearly score a sensational team goal. The ball\u2019s flicked down the middle, a series of cute passes between Mane, Fabinho and Wijnaldum. It\u2019s fed left to Robertson, who hooks inside for Wijnaldum. The Dutch international brings the ball down with a telescopic leg, then flicks a looper towards the top right. It\u2019s inches over the bar, with Dubravka backtracking in a panic, not likely to get there. That was all very pretty. 47 min: Newcastle are immediately on the front foot. A loose ball bouncing around the Liverpool box allows Krafth to romp in from the right and take a shot. His effort is deflected out for a corner that\u2019s only noteworthy because Shelvey gets a polite round of appreciative applause from the Kop when he takes the set piece. And we\u2019re off again! Newcastle get the second half underway. No changes, though on that subject here\u2019s Ian Copestake: \u201cMo seems a bit off his feed (nothing to do with Mane scoring obviously). Do you think he should be hooked to give Power Cube a go?\u201d Why not? It\u2019d be fascinating to see the lesser-spotted Shaqiri at some point. He\u2019s well rested, if nothing else. And of course to witness the startled look on Salah\u2019s coupon when he\u2019s taken off. Half-time entertainment. Messi &lt; Ronaldo &lt; Mane &lt; Willems. We\u2019re all agreed on that, right? And that\u2019s the first half over and done with. Newcastle started strongly but will be happy to hear the whistle. An opportunity to regroup. What a goal Jetro Willems scored, though. 45 min +1: Alexander-Arnold\u2019s right-wing cross is cleared. Wijnaldum stuns it on the edge of the box and shoots towards the bottom left, but it\u2019s a dribbler and Dubravka is able to claim easily. 45 min: There will be three added minutes. 44 min: Almiron breaks clear down the right, but he\u2019s well offside. Newcastle have shown very little in attack since the equaliser. 42 min: Alexander-Arnold hooks in from the right. Mane nearly returns the favour to Firmino, cushioning the ball down for his team-mate, 12 yards out. But Willems manages to read the danger and deflects the ball away, denying Firmino the chance to shoot. Newcastle need to hear the half-time whistle. Firmino robs Atsu in the midfield. He slips a lovely pass down the inside-right channel. Mane bursts into the box after it. Dubravka should claim, sliding out to gather, but the ball clanks off his hip and tees up Mane for a simple tap-in. 39 min: It\u2019s gone scrappy again, which will suit Newcastle. They\u2019d been under constant bombardment since the equaliser. 37 min: To be clear, it wasn\u2019t anything Almiron did. They were both running by the touchline, and Origi stepped off the pitch and slipped on some artificial turf, turning his ankle. He limps off, dejected. On comes Roberto Firmino. 35 min: Origi sits down. It looks as though he\u2019s got a problem with his left ankle, perhaps from that earlier coming together with Almiron. He\u2019s getting some treatment while everyone else takes a drink. 33 min: Liverpool continue to press. Alexander-Arnold crosses from the right. Mane chests down, and looks to have created room to shoot, but can\u2019t quite sort his feet out. 32 min: Van Dijk has a shot from 30 yards. Nope. Incidentally, that was Sadio Mane\u2019s 17th league goal of 2019. Only Sergio Aguero, with 18, has scored more in this calendar year. 31 min: Another Liverpool corner, out on the left. It comes to nothing. But the hosts have finally turned up. After the shakiest of starts, they\u2019re beginning to put Newcastle under serious pressure now. 30 min: A cross hit deep from the Liverpool left. Matip, so often a threat when he goes up, wins a header. His looping effort briefly threatens to fall into the top left, but Dubravka has it covered. Goal kick. Liverpool forget all about the non-penalty decision. Robertson powers his way past Schar down the left and into the box. The ball is laid off for Mane, who opens his body up and curls an unstoppable shot into the top right. Dubravka had no chance, that was perfectly placed. 26 min: But Liverpool are slowly finding their rhythm, and Salah wins another corner down the left. The set piece is lumped into the mixer, and Matip looks to have been dragged over by Lascelles. The Newcastle defender\u2019s arm is around his opponent\u2019s neck, but the referee doesn\u2019t think there\u2019s enough in it. VAR refuses to overturn. You\u2019ve seen them given. 25 min: Fabinho chips a fine pass down the inside right for Alexander-Arnold, whose first-time ball into the middle is blocked out for a corner by Dummett. Another crucial intervention, because Salah was waiting to sidefoot home. The corner comes to nothing. 23 min: Alexander-Arnold whips a glorious cross in from the right. Origi is preparing to smash a header home from six yards when Lascelles eyebrows away heroically. Mane tries to set up Origi again from the left, but though the striker connects with this cross, he can only lamely send the ball dribbling wide right. What defending by Lascelles, though! 22 min: Another long pass nearly does for Liverpool. Joelinton turns Matip and tears clear on goal, but the flag goes up. That was closer than the hosts would have liked. They don\u2019t look secure at the back at all. On the bench, Steve Bruce argues that Joelinton had been played on by Alexander-Arnold, and he may have had a point. 21 min: Liverpool try to pick up the tempo, at last, but Newcastle are snapping into the tackles, closing down all the space. It\u2019s hard for the hosts to string more than a couple of passes together. Eventually Oxlade-Chamberlain gets frustrated and tugs Shelvey to the ground. Free kick, and the pressure\u2019s relieved on Newcastle. 19 min: Adrian\u2019s off his line now, and that encourages Shelvey to attempt to Xabi Alonso one into the net from inside his own half. His effort barely hits the right-hand corner flag, but full marks for ambition. 18 min: Willems is causing Liverpool all sorts of bother out on the left. He powers into a little pocket of space and curls a delicate cross into the centre, where Almiron heads off target from an offside position. Adrian was a bit uncertain there, not sure whether to come off his line or not. 17 min: Origi twists, turns and earns the first corner of the match, out on the Liverpool left. Van Dijk and Matip come up. The former wins a header, but can only send it straight into the air. Newcastle half clear. The ball\u2019s whipped back in from the right, Mane contorting his body impressively to get a header away, though it\u2019s always going over. Better from Liverpool. 15 min: Mane and Alexander-Arnold combine down the right. Alexander-Arnold pulls back viciously from the byline, the ball breaking to Wijnaldum on the edge of the box. Wijnaldum should either shoot or feed Robertson, free to his left, but does neither. Instead he gives the ball to Oxlade-Chamberlain on his right, and a harmless floater is sent over the bar. 13 min: The Blaydon Races pinging off the walls of Anfield. Liverpool have had 81 percent of the possession so far, yet have been distinctly second best so far. That\u2019s statistics for you. 11 min: Liverpool finally wake up. Oxlade-Chamberlain strides forward, drifting gently left to right, and lashes a shot towards the bottom left. It\u2019s always heading wide, but that\u2019s at least something positive for the hosts, who look a bit groggy right now. 10 min: Another long ball, and Willems very nearly races clear down his wing. Alexander-Arnold steps up just in time, and the Newcastle scorer is offside. Just. Liverpool were playing a dangerous game there. They haven\u2019t got started at all. 9 min: Liverpool had been sloppy from the get-go, and paid the price there. Anfield was pretty quiet before Willems struck; the home fans have been shaken into making some noise now. The away supporters are certainly doing their bit. Well, well, well! A long ball down the middle finds Atsu in space. He\u2019s given a ludicrous amount of time to bring the ball down, turn, and feed Willems to his left. And then ... wham! Willems drops a shoulder to make space inside Alexander-Arnold, shifts the ball between his feet deliciously, and launches a stunning rising strike across a helpless Adrian and into the top right! What a goal! 5 min: Newcastle clearly haven\u2019t come here just to sit back, like they did at Spurs. Joelinton busies himself again, and finds Atsu down the left. Atsu nearly slips the lively Almiron free into the area, but Van Dijk is on hand to nick the ball back to Adrian, who clears his lines. 4 min: A nice dribble by Joelinton in the centre circle. He nearly releases Almiron into space down the right. Robertson intercepts. Origi goes over in a fair 50-50 challenge with Almiron, and for a second looks in pain, but he\u2019s up again quickly enough. All a bit scrappy so far, truth be told. 2 min: Liverpool stroke it around the middle. Newcastle sit back. This could set a pattern. And we\u2019re off! Looks like Liverpool have lost the toss, because they\u2019re kicking off and attacking the Kop in this first half, contrary to preference. The more superstitious locals won\u2019t like that. Much good turning Liverpool round like this did Arsenal the other week, mind. The teams are out! A lovely sunny September day at Anfield, and an atmosphere to match. The players clasp hands and bump fists. We\u2019ll be off in a minute, just after the showtunes. Jurgen Klopp speaks to BT Sport. \u201cWe have to rotate. Bobby is ready, Hendo is ready, but we have to think about the bigger picture. We could have made more changes, but then again we need to think about the rhythm as well, and we respect Newcastle too much to think about rotating and rotating. Newcastle were impressive against Tottenham, they were physically strong with a clear plan, and we need to have solutions for that.\u201d Some hot preview chat, just in case you\u2019d missed it all. Here\u2019s Jurgen Klopp on the timetable for Alisson\u2019s return ... and here\u2019s Steve Bruce reminiscing about the time he tried to sign Virgil van Dijk. A view inside the changing room. This is the home team\u2019s inner sanctum. It\u2019s a bit busy, isn\u2019t it? Sensory overload. It\u2019s on-brand, if nothing else. But this picture does allow us to exclusively reveal that Liverpool will be playing today in red shirts. Newcastle, sources close to the club have intimated, will wear black and white. Liverpool make two changes from the Burnley game a fortnight ago. Roberto Firmino and Jordan Henderson are encouraged to rest on the bench, recovering from their recent efforts for Brazil and England. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, making his 50th appearance for the club, and Divock Origi step up. Newcastle make just one change from their last game against Watford. Jonjo Shelvey returns to Anfield, replacing the injured Sean Longstaff. Liverpool: Adrian, Alexander-Arnold, Matip, van Dijk, Robertson, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Fabinho, Wijnaldum, Salah, Mane, Origi. Subs: Milner, Firmino, Gomez, Henderson, Lallana, Shaqiri, Kelleher. Newcastle United: Dubravka, Krafth, Schar, Lascelles, Dummett, Willems, Atsu, Hayden, Shelvey, Almiron, Joelinton. Subs: Clark, Ki, Muto, Fernandez, Manquillo, Darlow, Matthew Longstaff. Referee: Andre Marriner (West Midlands). This is one of the signature Premier League fixtures, its status the result of that game 23 years ago. A classic\u2019s a classic\u2019s a classic. Not that folk from the north-east will necessarily see it that way; one fan\u2019s signature fixture is another\u2019s annual ordeal. And since the heady April 1996 evening when Stan Collymore sent Kevin Keegan slumping over the hoardings in despair, Newcastle United have taken many other painful beatings at Anfield: another 4-3, one 4-2, five 3-0s and a 4-0 last Christmas. Oh Stan, what did you start. There\u2019s also the small matter of Liverpool\u2019s club-record 13-match winning run in the Premier League. With Mo Salah and Sadio Mane fully rested during international fortnight, they\u2019re extremely short-priced favourites to win this lunchtime. Newcastle are a healthy 16-1 shot, which looks generous enough until you consider they\u2019ve not won in the league at Anfield for a quarter of a century. But this is football, right here, and nothing\u2019s ever certain. Liverpool may have done the double over Newcastle last season, but the Toon gave them a real match at St James\u2019 Park in May. They\u2019ve already pulled off one of the shocks of the early season by winning at Spurs. And Steve Bruce has a decent managerial record against Liverpool, with a win ratio of one in four, not bad going considering he\u2019s always cast in the role of David to the red Goliath. So while Liverpool will be hoping to make it five out of five in the league this season, they can take nothing for granted. Especially as their previously parsimonious defence has been serving up a few chances this season: just the one clean sheet so far. Can Newcastle spring another shock? Or will Liverpool consolidate their position at the top of the table? We\u2019ll soon find out. The Premier League\u2019s back. It\u2019s on! Kick off: 12.30pm BST.",

However, if you\u2019re using a period-tracking app, there\u2019s a decent chance Facebook knows all about your sex life. A <a href=\"https://www.privacyinternational.org/long-read/3196/no-bodys-business-mine-how-menstruation-apps-are-sharing-your-data\">new study from Privacy International</a>, a UK-based charity, has found that some menstruation apps have been sharing their users\u2019 intimate details with the social network \u2013 including the last time you had unprotected intercourse. These apps include Maya (more than 5m downloads) and Period Tracker MIA Fem: Ovulation Calculator (over 2m users.)</p> <p>This isn\u2019t the first time women\u2019s health apps have raised serious privacy concerns. Earlier this year, for example, it was reported that Activision Blizzard, a video game company, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/13/theres-a-dark-side-to-womens-health-apps-menstrual-surveillance\">encouraging its employees to use family-planning apps</a>. These apps then shared user information with the company so it could keep track of how many of its employees were trying to get pregnant. And <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/you-give-apps-sensitive-personal-information-then-they-tell-facebook-11550851636\">testing done by The Wall Street Journal</a> in February found that Flo Period &amp; Ovulation Tracker informed Facebook when a user was menstruating or intending to get pregnant. (It would seem, from Privacy International\u2019s research, that Flo no longer does this.)</p> <p>Privacy International\u2019s research is yet another reminder that technology companies need to be doing a lot more work to stop user data being shared without explicit and informed consent. \u201cConsent is not just about a box to check,\u201d stresses Eva Blum-Dumonte, a researcher at Privacy International and author of the report. \u201cIt is about being able to understand what you consent to and being able to refuse.\u201d</p> <p>Maya, however, started sharing information with Facebook before a user could even agree to the privacy policy. Meanwhile many other period-tracking apps reviewed had inaccessible or opaque privacy policies, \u201cso there would have been no way for users to meaningfully consent to the sharing of their data\u201d.</p> <p>These latest revelations about period-tracking apps should also serve as a reminder that surveillance is a feminist issue. Patriarchy, after all, seeks to control and regulate women\u2019s bodies; digital surveillance is a highly effective way of doing this. As Frederike Kaltheuner, who heads Privacy International\u2019s work on corporate exploitation, notes: \u201cWhile privacy invasions affect us all, they disproportionately affect and harm those who are already marginalized.\u201d</p> <h2>Ms Monopoly: Hasbro gets into the gender empowerment game</h2> <p>Hot on the heels of releasing the much-panned Monopoly for Millennials and Monopoly for Socialists, Hasbro has come out with <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90402101/ms-monopoly-is-not-as-patronizing-as-hasbros-version-for-millennials-but-its-not-empowering-either\">Ms Monopoly</a>: \u201cThe first game where women make more than men.\u201d Female players get more money than guys when passing Go and the mascot is a woman called Milburn Pennybags.

At the turn of the 20th century Magie created the Landowner\u2019s Game to teach people about the problems with capitalism.

The Lions were perhaps a little unlucky to lose to the Giants, and in the process exit the <strong>AFL</strong> finals race, but they can look to the future with great enthusiasm, with or without Luke Hodge. There was no such luck needed by Manly to brush aside Cronulla in the <strong>NRL </strong>and send Paul Gallen into retirement on a losing note. But the result of the day belongs to Canberra, who ventured south and came away with a win over the Storm. Best of all, there\u2019s more footy to come before this season is done.</p> <p>Haven\u2019t had enough sport tonight, though? Good. You\u2019ve come to the right place.

      "bodyText": "Now that was draining. The Lions were perhaps a little unlucky to lose to the Giants, and in the process exit the AFL finals race, but they can look to the future with great enthusiasm, with or without Luke Hodge. There was no such luck needed by Manly to brush aside Cronulla in the NRL and send Paul Gallen into retirement on a losing note. But the result of the day belongs to Canberra, who ventured south and came away with a win over the Storm. Best of all, there\u2019s more footy to come before this season is done. Haven\u2019t had enough sport tonight, though? Good. You\u2019ve come to the right place. The fifth Ashes Test is happening right now, so do me a solid and yourself a favour by checking out our liveblog. Goodnight to all and to all a good night. That really could have gone either way. These two teams traded blows (sometimes literally) from the outset but it\u2019s the Giants who keep their season alive, booking a preliminary final date against Collingwood. The Lions go out in straight sets, heartbroken, but with their heads held high. They will be a fearsome outfit in 2020. AFL: Q4: 2 mins remaining: Brisbane Lions 11.14 (80) vs GWS Giants 12.11 (83) \u2013 little Brent Daniels kicks a big goal to put the Giants back in front. Cracking contest. It\u2019s almost unfortunate one team will be losing. AFL: Q4: 5 mins remaining: Brisbane Lions 11.14 (80) vs GWS Giants 11.11 (77) \u2013 that imaginary Gabba roof gets another workover as Allen Christensen kicks truly to put the Lions in front. I think this is what they call a big finish. The Sharks outscore the Sea Eagles in the second half. But that\u2019s as good as it gets for Cronulla, who are now free to book their holidays and who haven\u2019t won at Manly\u2019s home ground since Brett Kimmorley was knee-high to a grasshopper. Which is probably some time ago. Manly, however, can leave Trivago well alone, must keep on playing and next face South Sydney. They might even get some players back for that. Good, good win considering their personnel issues. But the last word goes to Paul Gallen. What can you say about a legend who has absolutely busted his gut and fulfilled every little bit of his God-given talent in the professional game for two decades? Is thanks a good place to start? AFL: Q4: 17 mins remaining: Brisbane Lions 10.11 (70) vs GWS Giants 10.11 (71) \u2013 the Lions fans roar with an early last-quarter goal and a poster to Eric Hipwood levelling the scores. I can\u2019t watch. At least I managed an update without mentioning Charlie Cameron. Oh bugger. AFL: 3QT: Brisbane Lions 9.9 (63) vs GWS Giants 10.10 (70) \u2013 and late in the term, Charlie Cameron raises the (non-existent) roof at the Gabba with a goal from a tight angle. If you know who\u2019s going to win from here, you\u2019re a better tipster than I am. Although considering I came something like 150,000th in the AFL tipping competition this season, that is nothing to beat your chest over. Cameron does seem the man of the moment. I certainly can\u2019t update this blog without mentioning him. There are a few others out there, but it wouldn\u2019t surprise if he is pivotal to the outcome of this stonking contest. AFL: Q3: 5 mins remaining: Brisbane Lions 8.9 (57) vs GWS Giants 10.8 (68) \u2013 the Lions are enjoying their share of the play but efficiency, and now inaccuracy in front of goal, is again dogging them. But step forward Daniel McStay, who shrugs a tackle, turns and snaps truly to keep this final well and truly alive. AFL: HT: Brisbane Lions 7.4 (46) vs GWS Giants 9.4 (58) \u2013 five goals to two in that quarter for the Giants. But the Lions are still very much in this if they can improve their efficiency inside-50 and in general play. Plenty of talk about the Giants\u2019 rough treatment of Charlie Cameron, who suffered an elbow knock in the first term but is running around like a headless chook. Against the spirit of footy or not? What say you wise lot? NRL: HT: Manly 18-4 Cronulla \u2013 a try to Bronson Xerri has reduced the deficit for the Sharks. But they have it all to do to stay alive in this finals race. If Cronulla manage to do so, it\u2019ll be their first win at, um, Lottoland since 2008, and just their sixth on the road against Manly in 52 whopping years. Remarkable. MelbourneTown says: Not since Greg Williams has there been a footballer as good as Toby Greene as dirty as Toby Greene. I say: I know what you mean, MT. Love him or hate him, you just can\u2019t take your eyes off him. Blimey, the AFL even made up a rule because of old mate Toby. AFL: Q2: 5 mins remaining: Brisbane Lions 7.4 (46) vs GWS Giants 8.4 (52) \u2013 a long bomb from a suitably ecstatic Zac Williams, followed by a major to Jeremy Cameron, has restored a little breathing space for the Giants. At the other end of the ground, GWS defenders are targeting poor Charlie Cameron\u2019s sore elbow in a display of tasteless niggle that takes one\u2019s mind back to a young Nick Riewoldt getting roughed up. Or is that just smart footy? And just as I\u2019m about to hit publish, Cam Rayner pops up and boots one for the Lions. The pitfalls of live updates. Still, the sentiments remain. A bit of breathing space for the Giants and all that. Just a bit. Meanwhile, in a country far, far away, in a sport using a ball that doesn\u2019t require inflating, England are slowly but surely building their lead in their bid to draw (but still not get) the Ashes. Don\u2019t believe me? Then believe Adam Collins. NRL: 20 mins: Manly 18-0 Cronulla \u2013 there\u2019s plenty of time to go but thus far the Sea Eagles are making a mockery of their injury/suspension woes ... and Cronulla\u2019s confidence about actually winning a game on the northern beaches. Tries to Apisai Koroisau, Moses Suli and Brad Parker have the home side in the box seat to advance to the second week of the finals. AFL: QT: Brisbane Lions 5.2 (32) vs GWS Giants 4.2 (26) \u2013 top of the evening, sports fans. First of all, vielen dank to Richard Parkin (who\u2019s just informed me he intends to regather his senses after that ripper of an NRL final by going to an artisan bread market). Secondly, it\u2019s all happening at the Gabba. The Giants were going like the clappers early on, kicking four quick goals, but the Lions have hit back hard to more than restore parity in what really was a quarter of two halves. Is that an eighth? Dunno. Charlie Cameron spent some time off with what looked a nasty elbow injury, but he is back on and kicking goals. Thirdly, please contribute to this jamboree by popping a few words in the comments section below, and/or by getting in touch on email or tweet @scott_heinrich So a frenetic finish to the second qualifying final in the NRL - I\u2019d love to stick around and chat some more about that, but it\u2019s over to Scott Heinrich to pick up what\u2019s going on in the AFL. We\u2019re off to Brisbane where the Lions are taking on the Giants and it\u2019s been a bright start to the visitors in the second AFL semi-final. Thanks for your company - i\u2019ll see you back here tomorrow, on Sportwatch! It\u2019s bounced back behind the four chasers!! It\u2019s an awful bounce, and Canberra collect and run into touch. What a dramatic ending. What a game. What scenes! You couldn\u2019t have more excitement than that! They\u2019re through to the penultimate game, the Raiders - and the Storm will have to go the long way. They\u2019re now on the other side of the draw - and they\u2019re on a collision course with the Roosters. 80 min: We\u2019ve got one final roll of the dice - the siren has sounded, but there\u2019s a high shot and a penalty and Storm kick to touch. They put up the midfield bomb - there\u2019s a host in purple racing through - but how\u2019s it going to bounce - this all hangs on the bounce ... 79 min: Storm with the quick restart - they\u2019ll look for Vunivalu on the edge - he climbs high the Melbourne winger - would you believe it! He\u2019s reclaimed the ball - but the touchy\u2019s flagged to say the Fijian put a hand in touch. The crowd are livid - the replays show - the winger was in the field of play. It\u2019s an awful call - they\u2019ve been robbed here, the Storm! Canberra scrum feed. You can hear the boos from AAMI Park in the nation\u2019s capital. Try! Melbourne 10-12 Canberra (Batemen) 77 min: Oh my, oh my, oh my! It\u2019s a hit from Dumais Lui that dislodges the ball from Addo-Carr as he brings it out from his own line. It falls fortuitously into a green shirt, and Bateman as easy as you like under the posts! Can you believe this - right at the death and it\u2019s under the post with a kick to come! Watch this - and how\u2019s the flick pass inside from Leilua. Croker from dead in front with the conversion attempt - he took an age to line it up, but he absolutely couldn\u2019t miss that from dead in front. He adds the extras and Canberra are in front! 75 min: It\u2019s a scratchy six to start, but they finish with the grubber. Well waited from Hodgson and Papenhuyzen is forced to collect but can\u2019t get out. Line drop out - six again, Canberra! 74 min: This is tough defence from Storm - and having done the tough stuff, they\u2019ve handed Canberra an easy six! They chanced their arm, the Raiders - it went to ground, and rather than dive on it, Melbourne have given up a tiny knock on! BIG OPPORTUNITY. 72 min: Ouch. Hodgson is down - and he\u2019s clutching at the ribs. Hopefully nothing serious there, he\u2019s copped a fair whack. That is the problem with these qualifying finals - knowing both teams remain alive at FT sometimes there\u2019s a temptation to put some hits on. It was fair from Kaufusi, but he\u2019s not happy, the Canberra hooker. 70 min: Clever play from Hughes, who rolls a good kick in-goal. Simonsen turns to collect, but he\u2019s caught by the Storm defence. Line drop out, Raiders - Storm get a look at six again! 68 min: This is suddenly end-to-end stuff. Hughes runs on the last and is pulled down 10m out from the Raiders\u2019 line. It\u2019s still anyone\u2019s game - Canberra have really lifted the last 10-15 minutes, and this one is just there for the taking. Who wants to blow it right open? 66 min: How\u2019s this for synchronicity - Canberra go up the other end, and it\u2019s a penalty - against the Raiders - for obstruction! Literally the same play that just went against the Storm, the duck back inside from the ball runner, and his teammate from the previous tackle infringes the defensive line. Comedy capers in what\u2019s been otherwise a high-intensity, high-skill game. 64 min: Oh my. Storm now with a big chance, and it\u2019s a clumsy penalty give away - Chambers I think it was has inadvertently taken out a defender 10m from the line, and they\u2019ve butchered a big opportunity. A close up of Bellamy in the box and he\u2019s raging! F-Bombs raining like daggers. He\u2019s fuming at his team\u2019s inability to make that count! 62 min: Ooohh - so unlucky, Canberra! They spread it wide, they had the numbers, Addo-Carr rushed on Niko-Klokstad who is forced into the bat-pass - but it drifts forward en route to his teammate! No try! What terrific thinking from the Storm winger - if he\u2019d hung back he couldn\u2019t have stopped the two-on-one. But he forces the error - and the Storm line remains intact. 60 min: A deep kick from Smith and Canberra need to bring it out from their own line. There\u2019s a ball to ground! Ooph, penalty against Storm - big let off, Raiders. Now they start with better field position. Let\u2019s see what they can fashion. 58 min: They chance it and head for the corner - it\u2019s Simonsen looking for the corner but whack! He\u2019s absolutely hammered into touch by Vunivalu! What a try-saving final tackle, his teammates rush to congratulate him. 56 min: This is better from Raiders - Sezer rolls the kick into the in-goal, Munster does brilliantly to clean up, but three or four in green swarm and prevent the return into field. Six again from the line out - a chance for some sustained possession, Canberra. 53 min: It\u2019s a nondescript six from Canberra that finishes with a mid-field bomb, easily defused. And now they\u2019re back on the back foot. Storm with the wind in their sails. Now it\u2019s a kick to the corner for a flying Vunivalu - who almost grounds - but Nicoll-Klokstad is there to see him into touch! A near thing. Penalty! Melbourne 10-6 Canberra 48 min: It\u2019s a purple-patch, literally, for the Storm. It\u2019s a terrific kick, regathered by the flying Addo-Carr, and as Melbourne are pulled down 5m short of the line Croker hang on too long in the tackle and gives away another easy penalty. Some shout that could have been a professional foul and a sin-binning, so on that front Canberra are lucky. They need to take some deep breaths and get back to what they were doing first half - it\u2019s been a horror first ten minutes: have they even had the ball yet? Penalty! Melbourne 8-6 Canberra 45 min: Ach. Silly from Hodgson, who throws out an arm after Papenhuyzen kicks and he\u2019s caught the Storm fullback across the chops. Penalty. Ricky Stuart must be tearing his hair out - all the solid work over the first forty, the grinding tackles, and then the easiest two point gift you\u2019ll ever see! And Smith says, yes please and duly kicks it. Try! Melbourne 6-6 Canberra (Vunivalu) Hughes goes to the corner with the bomb and it\u2019s the flying Fijian - too big a leap for Simonsen, and after 40 minutes of battering, they\u2019re back level, with a shot to come. Remarkable start for the Storm. Smith from the touchline, he strikes it just to the left of the uprights - is it bending.. not enough! No extras. Second half! And we\u2019re back! Melbourne with it ball in hand - and they\u2019ve earned an early penalty. A good start and an opportunity to wipe that poor first half from the memory. So. A brief pause for respite - your thoughts on that pulsating first forty? Where did all Canberra\u2019s dominance originate from, and where can the Storm find a way back into this one? Fire us an email or tweet to ennoble your fellow readers. And with just seconds left Cameron Smith slots his 100th kick of the season, to cut the margin to just four. How are they still within cooee here, the minor premiers?! A terrific half from the Raiders - the only frustration that they couldn\u2019t put a 10+ points lead on the scoreboard. Expect a spray from Craig Bellamy - his side just haven\u2019t been at the races tonight. 40 min: They run it wide, the Storm, with just seconds left in the half - and Sezer is called offside! A huge set of six for the Storm: they\u2019ve been completely on the back foot all half, but they\u2019re starring at a gilt-edged opportunity to go into the sheds level. 38 min: From nowhere it\u2019s a one-on-one strip from Brandon Smith, and it\u2019s Storm on the attack! They go to the air at the end of the set, but it\u2019s a tepid close to the six and Canberra defuse. 35 min: They\u2019re rattled, the Storm. It\u2019s now a penalty against Olam for roughing up Rapana after the tackle was effected. Miss! Would you believe it - from the other side, Croker\u2019s missed again! What a double let off for the Storm. He didn\u2019t look confident lining it up, and Melbourne restart from the 20m drop out. 32 min: It\u2019s a tackle without the ball from Vunivalu and Canberra are awarded a penalty and take a shot at the sticks! Miss. He was the man collected in the Vunivalu tackle, Croker, and maybe the head wasn\u2019t 100% clear - he\u2019s absolutely duffed that effort. It wasn\u2019t a gimme, but he\u2019s hit that badly. 31 min: Sezer kicks to the corner, but it\u2019s rolled just inside the in-goal zone - a first blot on his copy book. And to update, Nic Cotric\u2019s night is over. His nose is absolutely mangled. It\u2019s a horrorshow. 28 min: Wowee-wow. Sezer is absolutely running the show out there! He kicks to the edges and Jordan Rapana crosses in the corner and the Raiders celebrate. A try is awarded but we go upstairs. No try! He was inside the ten, and it\u2019s been chalked off for offside! Sheesh. How is this still a one-try game? They\u2019re hanging tough, the Storm. The Raiders are all over them - but on the scoreboard, they survive. 25 min: Wighton looks for the little chip-grubber (neither on the ground nor properly in the air) and it\u2019s landed right on the chest of Hughes, who scampers out from his own line! Big let off - they went very close there, Canberra but couldn\u2019t get points on the board. And now a penalty for Storm - three Raiders in a big tackle and the ball-runners\u2019 gone above the horizontal. Penalty, Storm - dangerous play. 23 min: And it\u2019s big Josh Papali\u2019i now off the bench for the Raiders - what momentum can he lend his side? A terrific banana kick back inside from Sezer on the last and as Papenhuyzen looks to shepherd it out it brushes the fullback\u2019s chest! Six again, Canberra. 20 min: Ay, ay, ay. A nasty break in play - Nic Cotric has copped an inadvertent boot to the nose whilst diving to effect a tackle. You don\u2019t want to see a slow-mo replay - that\u2019s absolutely awful. Excuse me while I go vom in a pot-plant somewhere. Of all people, guess who comes in to replace him - it\u2019s Joey Leilua - now officially 100% firework-in-eye free! 20 min: Ach! More bruising defence from Canberra - but they\u2019ve got off the hook, the Storm. Hughes elected to run on the last, but couldn\u2019t find a gap and then they threw some loose passes. The Raiders almost burst through, but there\u2019s a micro knock-on in there somewhere, so it\u2019s Storm\u2019s again. 16 min: There\u2019s some brutal defence going in here - the Raiders are working hard to pin the Storm on their own line, but a concern now! Simonsen puts it down - did he drop it cold? No, Munster\u2019s been stung for an attempted one-on-one strip. Ball back with Canberra. 13 min: Now it\u2019s Melbourne who go the sky - and it\u2019s spilled! The Storm regather and get six again, Nelson Asofa-Solomona reckons he\u2019s over the line - he stretches out ... no! It\u2019s a double movement - no try, and turnover! Big let off, Raiders. 10 min: Hughes goes to the sky on the final play, and the bomb is regathered by the Storm fullback Papenhuyzen, but he puts it on the toe, and it rolls just too heavy. At the other end, it\u2019s Papenhuyzen who\u2019s tested with the high ball - and he spills it! But we come back for a penalty, the fullback was taken out, illegally, whilst in the air. Melbourne ball. 7 min: Wowee. They\u2019ve had less than 20% of the pill over the start to this one, the Storm - right on the back foot, and what a blistering start from the Raiders! A pressure relieving penalty to the home side, and Smith takes time to settle the nerves before kicking to touch. The veteran hooker looks for the little grubber, but it\u2019s well anticipated and Canberra survive the six. Try! Melbourne 0-6 Canberra (Simonsen) Would you believe it! He wasn\u2019t even in the starting line up for Canberra until a firework spark got in the eyes of Joseph Leilua pre-game - but he\u2019s come in and crossed for first blood. Bailey Simonsen! Remarkable. A great ball from Wighton creates the cutout, and Croker does well to convert from the sideline. Here we go! 2 min: A tricky bounce off the Storm bomb which evades Croker before Cotric brings it back with a jinking run. An early penalty for Canberra and they kick to touch - what can they make now from 20m out. Still heavy contact in these tackles, they will look to probe left - but the Storm look to muscle up. Kick off! The veteran boot of Cam Smith get us underway and it\u2019s the Raiders - minus Leilua who\u2019s headed down the shoot and won\u2019t start in the centres - who bring it out. A steady six and now it\u2019s Melbourne\u2019s chance to bring out from their own line. A moment\u2019s tribute pre-game to Danny Frawley. Impeccably observed by the crowd. A sombre respite, but we\u2019ve got early consternation for the Raiders: Joseph Leilua can\u2019t make it onto the pitch after possibly taking a remnant of fireworks to the eye before kickoff! What are the odds of this - a bizarre pre-game injury. The Raiders trying to see if they can get their man out onto the field, but a slight delay from the expected kickoff time. Madness. It\u2019s good weather down in Melbourne - not arguably a boost to the home side who are more than adept of doing it in the wet. They have to be favourites, you\u2019d imagine - but Canberra have won their last five games on the road, so they\u2019ll fancy their chances as well. Craig Bellamy v Ricky Stuart. Two of the most experienced coaches kicking round. Let\u2019s see how this one unfolds, as Cameron Smith leads his chargers out onto the pitch. But! Without further ado, let\u2019s turn our attention to AAMI Park where we\u2019re not a thousand miles away from first whistle. Some team news: no changes for the Storm as \u201cshoulder watch\u201d gives the all clear for Cameron Munster to slot back in at five-eighth with the flying Josh Addo-Carr also returning. For the Raiders, Ricky Stuart has handed Dunamis Lui a start with Josh Papali\u2019i bumped to the bench for a no-doubt explosive introduction at some stage. Hudson Young is suspended for eye gouging and Ryan Sutton also misses out. Some news from the AFL as well - where it\u2019s bad for Geelong and Tom Hawkins: Can\u2019t even punch a bloke to the floor off the ball and leave him prone anymore. It\u2019s political correctness gone mad. Like Arsene Wenger come penalty time at Highbury though, I\u2019ll confess \u201cI did not see the incident\u201d so can\u2019t pass too much judgement. Hawkins and the Cats will have a chance to appeal before Friday\u2019s blockbuster preliminary final against Richmond. Before we deep dive into the NRL finals though here\u2019s an excellent write up from my colleague Kieran Pender about that heartwrenching double-overtime loss for the Boomers at the Basketball World Cup: Oh cruel fates, on such small margins etc. If you caught any of the tournament there was some simply sublime stuff from the Boomers, not least hard-fought wins against highly-rated opposition like Lithuania (World No 6) and France (World No 3). Not bad for a team nominally outside the world\u2019s top ten teams. That FIBA ranking will no doubt change after this result - keep an eye out for our liveblog tomorrow as the Boomers try to pick themselves up for the bronze-medal match against the USA-slayers, France. Afternoon/evening/morning all! The best to you from wherever you\u2019re following our coverage today. Are you a deep sea fisherman testing the limits of the Telstra 5G network by popping on from the remotest corner of the southern ocean to follow your beloved Raiders? Or a field worker in West Africa who found an old Melbourne Storm jersey in a $2 shop once and now you\u2019re hooked for life? Drop us an email or tweet to join the coverage today -we\u2019d love to hear from you: tips, quips or just if you want to give a shoutout to a fellow fan who you know will be UP for this one. Confession time: as a child in about 1989 I had a bit of a soft spot for the Raiders - John \u201cChicka\u201d Ferguson and all that. I curiously became a Panthers fan about 1991 with Brandy and the young Adolf coming through. How shameless are kids at just picking winners? It\u2019s a weekend in September, which can only mean one thing - footy finals. Things kicked off with a bang last night as the Roosters underlined their form as strong contenders to go back-to-back NRL premiers - today we find out just where their biggest rivals, the Melbourne Storm, are at. Standing in their way are the Canberra Raiders - no easy beats. In fact they\u2019re the team that handed the Storm their biggest regulation season loss (albeit by just four), while the Storm conversely handed the Raiders their biggest loss back in round two. Tasty. That\u2019s our feature match first up therefore on Sportwatch today - then we\u2019ll have AFL finals action as Brisbane play host to GWS Giants, the first of the NRL elimination finals as Manly and Cronulla lock horns, and later on: day three of the final Ashes Test action. Plenty to look forward to so draw the curtains, walk the dog and rush back here for a SESSION.",

      "body": "<p>Last month, Lisa Jenkins went for a walk alone around her local park for an hour, the first time she had done so unaided for 13 months. Jenkins was diagnosed with cerebral palsy at the age of three. Now 46, she struggles with vertigo and dizziness, as well as muscle spasms and poor mobility. An Access to Work grant means that she can get a taxi to and from her job in advertising, but for the last three months she hasn\u2019t needed one. The difference? She believes, a few drops of grassy-tasting oil under the tongue each morning.</p> <p>\u201cI have been using a 5% CBD oil for six months,\u201d she says. \u201cI previously took Duloxetine [an antidepressant medication also used to treat nerve pain] which was initially helpful, but my muscle-freezing episodes came back and I stopped taking it. I was also prescribed Valium, but you can\u2019t take that during the working day.\u201d A friend suggested she try the legal cannabis derivative. She has since been taking it every morning before work, using more during the day if her muscles become tight. \u201cWithin an hour of taking those first three drops, my muscles relax,\u201d she says. \u201cThe stress in my head calms down. The longer I take it, the better things seem to be.\u201d</p> <p>Jenkins is one of an estimated 1.3 million UK consumers who spend a total of \u00a3300m a year on cannabidiol (CBD) products. The oil contains one of the non-psychoactive chemicals found in the hemp plant \u2013 not the illegal mind-altering THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) that gets you high \u2013 and has been on the shelves of specialist health food shops and hemp \u201cdispensaries\u201d since 1998. It\u2019s 21 years since the British government first issued a licence for a cannabis extract to be developed for use in clinical trials.</p> <p>But in the last few years, it has leapt into the mainstream, acquiring the ubiquity of vitamin C and the social status of something much sexier. Most commonly consumed as an oil dropped under the tongue, CBD is also available as gummy sweets, capsules, body salves and e-liquids to vape. A CBD gold rush has led to an explosion of infused products, everything from soft drinks, tea and coffee to ice-cream, toothpaste and shampoo. You can get vaginal suppositories containing CBD (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/meetdaye/\" title=\"\">weed tampons</a>\u201d) that are said to help with pelvic pain; CBD-infused deodorants and sexual lubricant (said to promote relaxation and increase blood flow); even CBD hummus, perhaps to snack on after your lubricated endeavours.</p> <p>For CBD evangelists, it seems there is no health problem it can\u2019t help \u2013 from chronic pain, depression, anxiety and skin conditions to insomnia. Many report that CBD improves concentration, memory and general mood, as well as reducing stress levels. But the products can\u2019t legally make such claims; in the UK, CBD can be sold and advertised only as a generic food supplement. \u201cWe never use any medical terminology,\u201d says Johan Obel, director of popular online CBD retailer the Drug Store, standing in front of a huge, gold-framed artwork of a nerve cell in its central London store. \u201cIf people come in asking for advice on a specific issue, we tell them to do their own research.\u201d (He adds that their sexual lubricant is \u201cby far one of our bestsellers\u201d.)</p> <p>The boom in CBD-infused products on the high street is reminiscent of short-lived fads of recent years, such as our brief fixation with chia seeds, turmeric (rendering lattes highlighter-yellow) or spirulina. Only, CBD does not seem to be going anywhere. On a recent walk through London I visited a cafe serving camomile and CBD lattes, passed a yoga studio advertising CBD classes, and a bar serving CBD-infused cocktails. The CBD acronym, with its suggestion of something illicit, is catnip to anxious consumers in need of something they can\u2019t quite put their finger on.</p> <p>\u201cMost years there is a golden product \u2013 a \u2018Holy cow, can you believe how much of this we\u2019re selling?\u2019 thing\u201d, says Al Overton, buying director at Planet Organic. \u201cThere was the year of quinoa, the year of manuka honey, the year of the goji berry. Now it\u2019s CBD. We have been selling CBD products in our supplement section for just over two years, and it\u2019s been our fastest-growing product in that time. The majority of interested customers are female \u2013 especially those who feel that conventional pharmaceuticals aren\u2019t working for them.\u201d He thinks it\u2019s too soon to tell how much of a fixture \u201cinfused\u201d foods and drinks will become. \u201cWe see oils and capsules as more of a sophisticated and long-lasting trend, but it is early days with the \u2018edibles\u2019.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There is little evidence to support the claims CBD users make. So are we witnessing a global placebo effect?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I have been using CBD oil on and off for two years myself, finances permitting. It\u2019s expensive: a bottle of 1,000mg (10%) CBD oil from Love Hemp, costing \u00a349.99, lasts three weeks on average. I started because I wanted something to help with crippling period pain and associated symptoms, including anxiety. I love the taste; a bitter, herbaceous blast, like a joint dipped in strong extra-virgin olive oil. More importantly, when I take CBD regularly I notice that, when the dreaded week of cramping and gut chaos arrives, my perception of the pain shifts; I am aware of the sensations and their cause, but am less agitated by them. It feels as if the message of pain is being delivered in a different language. But does the science back me up?</p> <p>***</p> <p>Between 2002 and 2012 there were nine published studies on the use of CBD for the treatment of pain. By 2017, there had been 30. Almost all have shown potential benefits. However, with their small participant numbers, along with the fact that those participants are mostly rats, it is hard to make reliable claims about the human response. \u201cVery few of the claims for CBD\u2019s effects have actually been, or are being, tested,\u201d says Dr Sagnik Bhattacharyya, of King\u2019s College London\u2019s (KCL) psychiatry, psychology and neuroscience unit. Scientists there have been investigating whether large doses of <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30167644\" title=\"\">CBD could help treat </a><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30167644\" title=\"\">severe mental health problems</a>. \u201cWe have carried out a couple of studies where we show that a single 600mg dose of cannabidiol can normalise brain function in key regions we know are abnormal in people with psychosis,\u201d he says. KCL now has funding to carry out a large-scale trial to test whether CBD could be useful in treating young people at high risk for developing psychosis. If successful, its new trial will provide \u201cdefinitive proof\u201d of CBD\u2019s efficacy as an antipsychotic treatment, and pave the way for clinical use.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1e4e74ff2db4d3a0519268d6e7a17602022ae681\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1e4e74ff2db4d3a0519268d6e7a17602022ae681/0_481_5792_7235/801.jpg\" alt=\"toothpaste image\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018There is currently no evidence to show what regular low doses, like 30 or 40mg a day, are doing.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ilka &amp; Franz/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Meanwhile, Great Ormond Street hospital (GOSH) has published research showing that CBD has potential as a treatment for epilepsy, particularly for children with the severe, drug-resistant form known as <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa1611618\" title=\"\">Dravet syndrome</a>. The study showed that CBD reduced seizures by nearly 40% for the 120 children who took part in the trial. Prof Helen Cross, consultant in paediatric neurology at GOSH, said: \u201cThe results of this study are significant, and provide us with firm evidence of the effectiveness of cannabidiol. This drug could make a considerable difference to children who are living with Dravet syndrome and endure debilitating seizures.\u201d</p> <p>CBD has also been shown to be helpful for decreasing the myriad symptoms of anxiety. In 2011, scientists from Brazil conducted a trial with people with <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/npp20116#ref31\" title=\"\">social anxiety disorder</a>. Participants were split into two groups; one received a single 600mg dose of CBD, the other a placebo. All subjects completed a simulated public-speaking test which involved choosing a topic from a pre-selected list on which to deliver a speech, directed at a television camera as if addressing a large audience. Those who received the CBD dose before the task experienced considerably reduced anxiety levels compared with the placebo group. Preliminary evidence from another trial, completed this year by scientists at the University of Colorado, also suggests that CBD may be helpful to those who struggle with <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6326553/\" title=\"\">anxiety-related sleep disturbances</a>.</p> <p>But there is currently little robust evidence to support the claims CBD users make for the oils, coffees and hummus available on the high street. So, if over a million people are finding these work, are we witnessing a global placebo effect?</p> <p>***</p> <p>The doses used in clinical trials tend to be much higher than you can buy commercially. \u201cIt\u2019s usually between 600-1500mg, either as a one-off or repeated dose,\u201d says Dr Chandni Hindocha, a research fellow with University College London\u2019s clinical psychopharmacology unit, and part of a team researching whether CBD can help treat nicotine and other addictions (the results are promising so far). Hindocha emphasises the need for more research into dosing ranges. \u201cThere are no observational studies about the lower-dose products people are taking right now. We have no idea how much they\u2019re taking and why they\u2019re taking it.\u201d</p> <p>In the clinical trials Hindocha has worked on, most participants cannot differentiate between a 100mg dose of CBD and a placebo. \u201cIf most people are getting something like 50mg of CBD in a bottle, we need to think about what is going on,\u201d she says. In her opinion one-off doses of CBD in popular edibles are unlikely to have any effect. \u201cWe know that the beneficial effects of CBD usually come from building up levels of it in the body,\u201d she explains, but this is with the high trial doses. \u201cThere is currently no evidence to show what regular low doses, like 30 or 40mg a day, are doing.\u201d</p> <p>But what about the vast amount of anecdotal evidence for its efficacy, particularly in helping with chronic pain? Dee Montague, a press officer from Newport, Wales, was diagnosed with endometriosis in 2018, 18 years after first going to the doctor. The impact on her life has been striking. \u201cI played roller derby for eight years but had to quit due to the pain and fatigue. I am completely exhausted by the time I get home from work and can barely function.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d5deadbfb4c7f0217746f942965d7f053cdbae70\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d5deadbfb4c7f0217746f942965d7f053cdbae70/0_417_5792_7235/801.jpg\" alt=\"toothbrush and toothpaste illustration\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The majority of interested customers are female \u2013 especially those who feel that conventional pharmaceuticals aren\u2019t working for them.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ilka &amp; Franz/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She finds that CBD helps. In 2018,<strong> </strong>she began to experiment with an oil. \u201cIt took a week of regular doses to make any difference,\u201d she says, but she was pleasantly surprised. \u201cI found my cramps were far less intense. My sleep improved slightly, which made a real difference to my quality of life.\u201d She then switched to a skin balm, because \u201cthe guidance is to avoid taking CBD oils within two hours of other prescribed medication\u201d and she relies on daily medication for asthma. Montague has now been using a CBD-rich skin balm for a year, applying it to her stomach and pain spots on her legs every morning and night. The 100g jar she buys contains 1,000mg of CBD; Montague admits it is hard to know exactly how much CBD she is using each time, and does not view it as \u201ca cure or painkiller, as such\u201d. But the side-effects are nonexistent compared with opiates, she says. \u201c I feel far more in control of my pain and day-to-day life.\u201d</p> <p>CBD works by affecting the function of our endocannabinoid system (ECS). Made up of neurons (nerve cells), endocannabinoids (cannabis-like substances the body makes naturally) and cannabinoid receptors, the ECS is responsible for regulating the body\u2019s systems to maintain homeostasis: keeping our internal temperature, blood sugar and pH levels balanced, along with the amount of water in the body. It tells the body when to start sweating (to cool down) and when to stop. Everything from chronic pain to migraines and epileptic seizures have been linked to ECS deficiency.</p> <p>It is thought that when we introduce a new cannabinoid into the body, such as CBD, it binds with these receptors and, like a molecular power-up, increases the amount of natural cannabinoids in the body. CBD has also been shown to bind with receptors for serotonin (our feelgood molecule) and GABA (the molecule that calms the nervous system), increasing the amount available to the body \u2013 offering a potential explanation for CBD\u2019s reported calming effects.</p> <p>I asked Hindocha whether stories such as Montague\u2019s suggest that such small doses could be having an impact? \u201cIt is very interesting,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause there is an argument that low doses of CBD could potentially affect inflammation in the body.\u201d One complicating factor is metabolism. \u201cWhen someone takes CBD oil, much of it will be broken down by the liver,\u201d Hindocha explains. \u201cWithout knowing about their metabolism, we have no idea how much CBD they\u2019re really absorbing.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>Before you can consider how much you\u2019re absorbing, you need to know how much you\u2019re taking in the first place: this year a major <a href=\"https://irp-cdn.multiscreensite.com/51b75a3b/files/uploaded/Report%20%7C%20CBD%20in%20the%20UK%20-%20Exec%20Summary.pdf\" title=\"\">study by the Centre for Medicinal Cannabis</a> found that 38% of CBD oils contain less than half the amount of CBD stated on the label. Almost half (45%) of the products contained more than 0.2% of THC (the Home Office\u2019s legal threshold) and, therefore, were technically illegal in the UK. </p> <p>Browse the CBD shelf in your local health shop and you\u2019ll find a huge variation of strengths on offer; but a higher CBD content means a higher price. Holland &amp; Barrett sells a 10ml bottle of oil by Jacob Hooy containing 5% CBD for \u00a329.99; Boots stocks 10ml bottles by Dragonfly containing 11.1% CBD for \u00a370. One of the strongest products available is by Love Hemp: a 10ml bottle with 40% CBD, for \u00a3259.99. Love Hemp suggests a maximum daily dose of 200mg; while it is thought impossible to overdose on CBD, most producers offer guidance on dosing. I notice that none of the infused products carry warnings about maximum doses, age limits, or driving.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Women want to be responsible for their own health. They want more options than those offered by traditional medicine</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Hemp can be legally grown in the UK with a government licence, but is an incredibly small sector. It is estimated that only 810 hectares (2,000 acres) of hemp are currently cultivated in the UK\u2019s 42m acres of agricultural land. When I visited a couple of rough-and-ready CBD outlets in London which, as well as oils, sold whole hemp flowers in clear plastic bags, it made me nervous about where it came from. I was routinely assured the flowers contained less than the legal 0.2% of THC. But how can a layperson, without access to a lab and a scientist to test it, really know?</p> <p>The nice man running one of my local CBD shops \u2013 a modest outfit selling oils, e-liquids, balms and bongs \u2013 offered me tea and lots of convincing chat, but agreed that dosing essentially comes down to experimenting. The smell of his shop instantly, rather thrillingly, transported me to the top of the multistorey car park in Bishop\u2019s Stortford, the locus of my teenage experimentation with marijuana. Perhaps that whiff of transgression contributes to CBD\u2019s seductiveness? Even if we know it won\u2019t get us high, it\u2019s wellness with an edge.</p> <p>The Drug Store\u2019s Obel tells me that nearly all the CBD products in the UK originate from the same wholesalers; the extraction equipment is too expensive for smaller companies. \u201cIt takes a long time to figure out how to do it properly \u2013 only a few people actually have the knowledge,\u201d he explains. In most cases, producers simply add the extract to their carrier oil of choice and put a new label on it.</p> <p>Obel says the majority of his customers are women aged 40 and above. The audience for a recent in-store event, a panel discussion on the impact of stress, was 80% female. \u201cFrom what we have seen, women want to self-educate and be responsible for their own health. They want to seek more options than those offered by traditional medicine,\u201d he says. He does not believe the boom in CBD-infused high-street products like chocolate, tea and hummus will last: \u201cWe believe everyday products with CBD added will fade away. Products in which CBD is the actual active ingredient, or where CBD serves a specific purpose in supplements or cosmetics \u2013 those will most likely remain.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>That we currently have no idea of CBD\u2019s full potential is at once incredibly exciting and frustrating. Without more dedicated research, the commercial market will remain something of a wild west. Meanwhile, people will continue to inform themselves, spending their money on products with, it seems, woolly efficacy. The costs will remain prohibitive to many. Meanwhile brands will continue merrily infusing their teas and ice-creams with nominal amounts of CBD, knowing that people will pay extra for the buzz cannabis brings.</p> <p>I am now thinking more carefully about my own experimentation. Unless I pay close to \u00a3300 on a regular basis, for the highest strength of CBD oils commercially available \u2013 the only products that come close to what is being clinically tested \u2013 it strikes me that I may be experiencing a placebo effect. Then again, with the research in its infancy, I might not. So I will finish the bottle I have. Beyond that, the question is: how much am I willing to pay for a maybe?</p> <h2>A touch of grass: high-street CBD, taste-tested</h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.buddhateas.co.uk/index.php/cbd-matcha-green-tea.html\">Buddha Teas CBD Matcha Green Tea Blend</a> (18 bags), \u00a316.99</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"f4c8deb23548261cf96048502ebe050a9bf23472\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f4c8deb23548261cf96048502ebe050a9bf23472/10_9_976_976/500.jpg\" alt=\"Buddha Teas CBD Matcha Green Tea Blend\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>They say</strong> \u201cOur innovative process ensures that the CBD in our tea bags actually ends up in your tea.\u201d</p> <p><strong>CBD count</strong> 5mg per bag</p> <p><strong>Our verdict</strong> \u201cThe taste is very subtle and the bags can rip, but I was surprised at how easily I fell (and stayed) asleep \u2013 I\u2019m normally a very light sleeper.\u201d</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.themptation.co.uk/product-page/hemp-spreadables\">Themptation Hemp Chocolate Spreadables CBD vanilla spread</a>, 165g, \u00a35.05</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"124bdd92ea5c5bda94d4db149522ce27136ffa0a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/124bdd92ea5c5bda94d4db149522ce27136ffa0a/0_3_566_708/400.jpg\" alt=\"Themptation Hemp Chocolate Spreadables CBD vanilla spread\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>They say</strong> \u201cMore seeds than sugar, more hemp than any other ingredient, packed with 10mg of organic CBD oil and vanilla.\u201d</p> <p><strong>CBD count</strong> 10mg</p> <p><strong>Our verdict</strong> \u201cThis is so delicious and wholesome-tasting, it\u2019s hard to separate that feelgood factor from any CBD effect.

      "bodyText": "Last month, Lisa Jenkins went for a walk alone around her local park for an hour, the first time she had done so unaided for 13 months. Jenkins was diagnosed with cerebral palsy at the age of three. Now 46, she struggles with vertigo and dizziness, as well as muscle spasms and poor mobility. An Access to Work grant means that she can get a taxi to and from her job in advertising, but for the last three months she hasn\u2019t needed one. The difference? She believes, a few drops of grassy-tasting oil under the tongue each morning. \u201cI have been using a 5% CBD oil for six months,\u201d she says. \u201cI previously took Duloxetine [an antidepressant medication also used to treat nerve pain] which was initially helpful, but my muscle-freezing episodes came back and I stopped taking it. I was also prescribed Valium, but you can\u2019t take that during the working day.\u201d A friend suggested she try the legal cannabis derivative. She has since been taking it every morning before work, using more during the day if her muscles become tight. \u201cWithin an hour of taking those first three drops, my muscles relax,\u201d she says. \u201cThe stress in my head calms down. The longer I take it, the better things seem to be.\u201d Jenkins is one of an estimated 1.3 million UK consumers who spend a total of \u00a3300m a year on cannabidiol (CBD) products. The oil contains one of the non-psychoactive chemicals found in the hemp plant \u2013 not the illegal mind-altering THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) that gets you high \u2013 and has been on the shelves of specialist health food shops and hemp \u201cdispensaries\u201d since 1998. It\u2019s 21 years since the British government first issued a licence for a cannabis extract to be developed for use in clinical trials. But in the last few years, it has leapt into the mainstream, acquiring the ubiquity of vitamin C and the social status of something much sexier. Most commonly consumed as an oil dropped under the tongue, CBD is also available as gummy sweets, capsules, body salves and e-liquids to vape. A CBD gold rush has led to an explosion of infused products, everything from soft drinks, tea and coffee to ice-cream, toothpaste and shampoo. You can get vaginal suppositories containing CBD (\u201cweed tampons\u201d) that are said to help with pelvic pain; CBD-infused deodorants and sexual lubricant (said to promote relaxation and increase blood flow); even CBD hummus, perhaps to snack on after your lubricated endeavours. For CBD evangelists, it seems there is no health problem it can\u2019t help \u2013 from chronic pain, depression, anxiety and skin conditions to insomnia. Many report that CBD improves concentration, memory and general mood, as well as reducing stress levels. But the products can\u2019t legally make such claims; in the UK, CBD can be sold and advertised only as a generic food supplement. \u201cWe never use any medical terminology,\u201d says Johan Obel, director of popular online CBD retailer the Drug Store, standing in front of a huge, gold-framed artwork of a nerve cell in its central London store. \u201cIf people come in asking for advice on a specific issue, we tell them to do their own research.\u201d (He adds that their sexual lubricant is \u201cby far one of our bestsellers\u201d.) The boom in CBD-infused products on the high street is reminiscent of short-lived fads of recent years, such as our brief fixation with chia seeds, turmeric (rendering lattes highlighter-yellow) or spirulina. Only, CBD does not seem to be going anywhere. On a recent walk through London I visited a cafe serving camomile and CBD lattes, passed a yoga studio advertising CBD classes, and a bar serving CBD-infused cocktails. The CBD acronym, with its suggestion of something illicit, is catnip to anxious consumers in need of something they can\u2019t quite put their finger on. \u201cMost years there is a golden product \u2013 a \u2018Holy cow, can you believe how much of this we\u2019re selling?\u2019 thing\u201d, says Al Overton, buying director at Planet Organic. \u201cThere was the year of quinoa, the year of manuka honey, the year of the goji berry. Now it\u2019s CBD. We have been selling CBD products in our supplement section for just over two years, and it\u2019s been our fastest-growing product in that time. The majority of interested customers are female \u2013 especially those who feel that conventional pharmaceuticals aren\u2019t working for them.\u201d He thinks it\u2019s too soon to tell how much of a fixture \u201cinfused\u201d foods and drinks will become. \u201cWe see oils and capsules as more of a sophisticated and long-lasting trend, but it is early days with the \u2018edibles\u2019.\u201d I have been using CBD oil on and off for two years myself, finances permitting. It\u2019s expensive: a bottle of 1,000mg (10%) CBD oil from Love Hemp, costing \u00a349.99, lasts three weeks on average. I started because I wanted something to help with crippling period pain and associated symptoms, including anxiety. I love the taste; a bitter, herbaceous blast, like a joint dipped in strong extra-virgin olive oil. More importantly, when I take CBD regularly I notice that, when the dreaded week of cramping and gut chaos arrives, my perception of the pain shifts; I am aware of the sensations and their cause, but am less agitated by them. It feels as if the message of pain is being delivered in a different language. But does the science back me up? *** Between 2002 and 2012 there were nine published studies on the use of CBD for the treatment of pain. By 2017, there had been 30. Almost all have shown potential benefits. However, with their small participant numbers, along with the fact that those participants are mostly rats, it is hard to make reliable claims about the human response. \u201cVery few of the claims for CBD\u2019s effects have actually been, or are being, tested,\u201d says Dr Sagnik Bhattacharyya, of King\u2019s College London\u2019s (KCL) psychiatry, psychology and neuroscience unit. Scientists there have been investigating whether large doses of CBD could help treat severe mental health problems. \u201cWe have carried out a couple of studies where we show that a single 600mg dose of cannabidiol can normalise brain function in key regions we know are abnormal in people with psychosis,\u201d he says. KCL now has funding to carry out a large-scale trial to test whether CBD could be useful in treating young people at high risk for developing psychosis. If successful, its new trial will provide \u201cdefinitive proof\u201d of CBD\u2019s efficacy as an antipsychotic treatment, and pave the way for clinical use. Meanwhile, Great Ormond Street hospital (GOSH) has published research showing that CBD has potential as a treatment for epilepsy, particularly for children with the severe, drug-resistant form known as Dravet syndrome. The study showed that CBD reduced seizures by nearly 40% for the 120 children who took part in the trial. Prof Helen Cross, consultant in paediatric neurology at GOSH, said: \u201cThe results of this study are significant, and provide us with firm evidence of the effectiveness of cannabidiol. This drug could make a considerable difference to children who are living with Dravet syndrome and endure debilitating seizures.\u201d CBD has also been shown to be helpful for decreasing the myriad symptoms of anxiety. In 2011, scientists from Brazil conducted a trial with people with social anxiety disorder. Participants were split into two groups; one received a single 600mg dose of CBD, the other a placebo. All subjects completed a simulated public-speaking test which involved choosing a topic from a pre-selected list on which to deliver a speech, directed at a television camera as if addressing a large audience. Those who received the CBD dose before the task experienced considerably reduced anxiety levels compared with the placebo group. Preliminary evidence from another trial, completed this year by scientists at the University of Colorado, also suggests that CBD may be helpful to those who struggle with anxiety-related sleep disturbances. But there is currently little robust evidence to support the claims CBD users make for the oils, coffees and hummus available on the high street. So, if over a million people are finding these work, are we witnessing a global placebo effect? *** The doses used in clinical trials tend to be much higher than you can buy commercially. \u201cIt\u2019s usually between 600-1500mg, either as a one-off or repeated dose,\u201d says Dr Chandni Hindocha, a research fellow with University College London\u2019s clinical psychopharmacology unit, and part of a team researching whether CBD can help treat nicotine and other addictions (the results are promising so far). Hindocha emphasises the need for more research into dosing ranges. \u201cThere are no observational studies about the lower-dose products people are taking right now. We have no idea how much they\u2019re taking and why they\u2019re taking it.\u201d In the clinical trials Hindocha has worked on, most participants cannot differentiate between a 100mg dose of CBD and a placebo. \u201cIf most people are getting something like 50mg of CBD in a bottle, we need to think about what is going on,\u201d she says. In her opinion one-off doses of CBD in popular edibles are unlikely to have any effect. \u201cWe know that the beneficial effects of CBD usually come from building up levels of it in the body,\u201d she explains, but this is with the high trial doses. \u201cThere is currently no evidence to show what regular low doses, like 30 or 40mg a day, are doing.\u201d But what about the vast amount of anecdotal evidence for its efficacy, particularly in helping with chronic pain? Dee Montague, a press officer from Newport, Wales, was diagnosed with endometriosis in 2018, 18 years after first going to the doctor. The impact on her life has been striking. \u201cI played roller derby for eight years but had to quit due to the pain and fatigue. I am completely exhausted by the time I get home from work and can barely function.\u201d She finds that CBD helps. In 2018, she began to experiment with an oil. \u201cIt took a week of regular doses to make any difference,\u201d she says, but she was pleasantly surprised. \u201cI found my cramps were far less intense. My sleep improved slightly, which made a real difference to my quality of life.\u201d She then switched to a skin balm, because \u201cthe guidance is to avoid taking CBD oils within two hours of other prescribed medication\u201d and she relies on daily medication for asthma. Montague has now been using a CBD-rich skin balm for a year, applying it to her stomach and pain spots on her legs every morning and night. The 100g jar she buys contains 1,000mg of CBD; Montague admits it is hard to know exactly how much CBD she is using each time, and does not view it as \u201ca cure or painkiller, as such\u201d. But the side-effects are nonexistent compared with opiates, she says. \u201c I feel far more in control of my pain and day-to-day life.\u201d CBD works by affecting the function of our endocannabinoid system (ECS). Made up of neurons (nerve cells), endocannabinoids (cannabis-like substances the body makes naturally) and cannabinoid receptors, the ECS is responsible for regulating the body\u2019s systems to maintain homeostasis: keeping our internal temperature, blood sugar and pH levels balanced, along with the amount of water in the body. It tells the body when to start sweating (to cool down) and when to stop. Everything from chronic pain to migraines and epileptic seizures have been linked to ECS deficiency. It is thought that when we introduce a new cannabinoid into the body, such as CBD, it binds with these receptors and, like a molecular power-up, increases the amount of natural cannabinoids in the body. CBD has also been shown to bind with receptors for serotonin (our feelgood molecule) and GABA (the molecule that calms the nervous system), increasing the amount available to the body \u2013 offering a potential explanation for CBD\u2019s reported calming effects. I asked Hindocha whether stories such as Montague\u2019s suggest that such small doses could be having an impact? \u201cIt is very interesting,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause there is an argument that low doses of CBD could potentially affect inflammation in the body.\u201d One complicating factor is metabolism. \u201cWhen someone takes CBD oil, much of it will be broken down by the liver,\u201d Hindocha explains. \u201cWithout knowing about their metabolism, we have no idea how much CBD they\u2019re really absorbing.\u201d *** Before you can consider how much you\u2019re absorbing, you need to know how much you\u2019re taking in the first place: this year a major study by the Centre for Medicinal Cannabis found that 38% of CBD oils contain less than half the amount of CBD stated on the label. Almost half (45%) of the products contained more than 0.2% of THC (the Home Office\u2019s legal threshold) and, therefore, were technically illegal in the UK. Browse the CBD shelf in your local health shop and you\u2019ll find a huge variation of strengths on offer; but a higher CBD content means a higher price. Holland &amp; Barrett sells a 10ml bottle of oil by Jacob Hooy containing 5% CBD for \u00a329.99; Boots stocks 10ml bottles by Dragonfly containing 11.1% CBD for \u00a370. One of the strongest products available is by Love Hemp: a 10ml bottle with 40% CBD, for \u00a3259.99. Love Hemp suggests a maximum daily dose of 200mg; while it is thought impossible to overdose on CBD, most producers offer guidance on dosing. I notice that none of the infused products carry warnings about maximum doses, age limits, or driving. Hemp can be legally grown in the UK with a government licence, but is an incredibly small sector. It is estimated that only 810 hectares (2,000 acres) of hemp are currently cultivated in the UK\u2019s 42m acres of agricultural land. When I visited a couple of rough-and-ready CBD outlets in London which, as well as oils, sold whole hemp flowers in clear plastic bags, it made me nervous about where it came from. I was routinely assured the flowers contained less than the legal 0.2% of THC. But how can a layperson, without access to a lab and a scientist to test it, really know? The nice man running one of my local CBD shops \u2013 a modest outfit selling oils, e-liquids, balms and bongs \u2013 offered me tea and lots of convincing chat, but agreed that dosing essentially comes down to experimenting. The smell of his shop instantly, rather thrillingly, transported me to the top of the multistorey car park in Bishop\u2019s Stortford, the locus of my teenage experimentation with marijuana. Perhaps that whiff of transgression contributes to CBD\u2019s seductiveness? Even if we know it won\u2019t get us high, it\u2019s wellness with an edge. The Drug Store\u2019s Obel tells me that nearly all the CBD products in the UK originate from the same wholesalers; the extraction equipment is too expensive for smaller companies. \u201cIt takes a long time to figure out how to do it properly \u2013 only a few people actually have the knowledge,\u201d he explains. In most cases, producers simply add the extract to their carrier oil of choice and put a new label on it. Obel says the majority of his customers are women aged 40 and above. The audience for a recent in-store event, a panel discussion on the impact of stress, was 80% female. \u201cFrom what we have seen, women want to self-educate and be responsible for their own health. They want to seek more options than those offered by traditional medicine,\u201d he says. He does not believe the boom in CBD-infused high-street products like chocolate, tea and hummus will last: \u201cWe believe everyday products with CBD added will fade away. Products in which CBD is the actual active ingredient, or where CBD serves a specific purpose in supplements or cosmetics \u2013 those will most likely remain.\u201d *** That we currently have no idea of CBD\u2019s full potential is at once incredibly exciting and frustrating. Without more dedicated research, the commercial market will remain something of a wild west. Meanwhile, people will continue to inform themselves, spending their money on products with, it seems, woolly efficacy. The costs will remain prohibitive to many. Meanwhile brands will continue merrily infusing their teas and ice-creams with nominal amounts of CBD, knowing that people will pay extra for the buzz cannabis brings. I am now thinking more carefully about my own experimentation. Unless I pay close to \u00a3300 on a regular basis, for the highest strength of CBD oils commercially available \u2013 the only products that come close to what is being clinically tested \u2013 it strikes me that I may be experiencing a placebo effect. Then again, with the research in its infancy, I might not. So I will finish the bottle I have. Beyond that, the question is: how much am I willing to pay for a maybe? A touch of grass: high-street CBD, taste-tested Buddha Teas CBD Matcha Green Tea Blend (18 bags), \u00a316.99 They say \u201cOur innovative process ensures that the CBD in our tea bags actually ends up in your tea.\u201d CBD count 5mg per bag Our verdict \u201cThe taste is very subtle and the bags can rip, but I was surprised at how easily I fell (and stayed) asleep \u2013 I\u2019m normally a very light sleeper.\u201d Themptation Hemp Chocolate Spreadables CBD vanilla spread, 165g, \u00a35.05 They say \u201cMore seeds than sugar, more hemp than any other ingredient, packed with 10mg of organic CBD oil and vanilla.\u201d CBD count 10mg Our verdict \u201cThis is so delicious and wholesome-tasting, it\u2019s hard to separate that feelgood factor from any CBD effect.

      "bodyText": "Sixty-nine historic English towns and cities will benefit from a \u00a395m regeneration fund, the government has announced. The funding is intended to \u201cbreathe new life\u201d into struggling high streets across the country bytransforming abandoned buildings into shops, houses and community centres. Towns and cities entered bids after the scheme was announced in May, with the Midlands winning the largest share of \u00a321.1m. The government\u2019s future high street fund is providing \u00a352m, the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) \u00a340m and the National Lottery Heritage Fund \u00a33m. The announcement comes after it was revealed this week that 16 stores had shut down every day in the first half of 2019, a retail crisis fuelled by an increasing shift to online shopping that has already cost tens of thousands of jobs. Last year the then chancellor, Philip Hammond, announced a \u00a3675m fund intend to halting high street decline that has left one in 10 shops in UK town centres lying empty. The Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) has since promised an additional \u00a3325m to bring the size of the fund to \u00a31bn. The government said funding would attract commercial investment and support wider regeneration in the 69 successful areas. \u201cOur nation\u2019s heritage is one of our great calling cards to the world, attracting millions of visitors to beautiful historic buildings that sit at the heart of our communities,\u201d said the culture secretary, Nicky Morgan. The shadow culture secretary, Tom Watson, was critical of the announcement, saying that the fund \u201cpales in comparison\u201d to the \u00a31bn \u201ccultural capital fund\u201d that Labour has committed to. By region, the funding breaks down as follows: London and the south-east: \u00a314.3m South-west: \u00a313.7m Midlands: \u00a321.1m North-east and Yorkshire: \u00a317.2m North-west: \u00a318.7m The winning towns are: North-east and Yorkshire Barnsley; Hexham; Huddersfield; Hull; Leeds; Middlesbrough; North Shields; Northallerton; Scarborough CA; Castle Ward; Selby town centre; Skipton; Sowerby Bridge and Wakefield North-west Bacup, Rossendale; Barrow in Furness; Blackpool; Burnley; Chester; Fleetwood; Kirkham; Lancaster; Maryport, Cumbria; Ormskirk; Prescot; Stalybridge; Tyldesley, Greater Manchester and Wigan town centre Midlands Brierley Hill; Buxton; Coventry; Grantham; Hinckley; Kettering town centre; Leicester; Leominster; Lincoln; Newark-on-Trent Town Centre; Oswestry; Stoke on Trent and Wednesbury town centre East of England Bedford; Dunstable; Great Yarmouth; King\u2019s Lynn; Lowestoft; North Walsham and Swaffham South-west: Chard; Cullompton; Gloucester; Keynsham; Midsomer Norton; Plymouth; Poole; Redruth; Tewkesbury and Weston-Super-Mare. London and the south-east: Chatham Intra; Croydon; Gosport; Harlesden; Hastings; Newport; Ramsgate; Reading; Ryde; Tottenham; Tower Hamlets and Woolwich.",

I was active in the Anti-Nazi League and the Socialist Workers party, joining demonstrations and picket lines and attending earnest meetings in dingy pubs. I\u2019d just started my first job as a trainee journalist. I was living with my boyfriend on the notorious North Peckham estate in south London.</p> <p>The boyfriend was also a member of the SWP and a dominant figure in PCL\u2019s student union, first as the editor of the student paper, and then \u2013 twice \u2013 as president. Alaric Bamping had a reputation as a leftwing firebrand, leading sit-ins and protests and conducting long, fierce arguments with anyone who disagreed with him.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/27/nigel-farage-brexit-party-win-big-wake-up-call-westminster\">Farage warns Tories Brexit party could win general election</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So how the hell, 40 years on, has he ended up as a parliamentary candidate for the Brexit party?</p> <p>Nearly everyone shifts over the years: I ceased parroting ultra-left rhetoric in the early 1980s, and I\u2019m more inclined to gentle reform than revolution these days. But Brexit and the fracturing of traditional tribes and loyalties has exposed and exacerbated our political journeys, sometimes causing acrimonious or painful rifts within families and testing friendships to destruction.</p> <p>Another friend from my student days alerted me to Alaric\u2019s news. \u201cWhat happened to swing him from the far left in PCL days to far right now?\u201d he asked in a text. It\u2019s a good question; I went to find out.</p> <p>Alaric and I parted in early 1982; neither of us could recall the exact date or circumstances.

For a while, he maintained two simultaneous relationships, producing two children with one partner, before finally settling down with Julia \u2013 also a former PCL student \u2013 with whom he had three more children. Throughout, he ran \u201ca couple of businesses\u201d \u2013 antiquarian books and student property rentals \u2013 but mainly shouldered responsibility for childcare while his partners pursued their careers.</p> <p>In 1985, five years after he \u201cfell out\u201d with the SWP, he joined the Labour party and became a constituency political officer in east London. It didn\u2019t last; he \u201cdrifted away\u201d a few years later.</p> <p>By 1997, he was back with Julia, whose PR company Hobsbawm Macaulay Communications was then at the heart of the New Labour project. She founded the company with her old school friend, Sarah Macaulay, who married Gordon Brown in 2000. In Alaric and Julia\u2019s downstairs loo, along with a photograph of Brown and another of Julia receiving an OBE at Buckingham Palace a few years ago, hangs a framed graphic from the <em>Guardian</em> in May 1997. Headlined The In-crowd, it shows the \u201cintricate amalgam of friends and advisers of Tony Blair\u201d. Julia Hobsbawm and Sarah Macaulay are at the centre of the web.</p> <p>The old school friends have long since fallen out. \u201cI didn\u2019t help,\u201d said Alaric. \u201cI avoided Gordon Brown like the plague. I was around them, but I was considered awkward squad. I didn\u2019t really like the Blairites at all, they didn\u2019t appeal to me. I was on the edge of the Stop The War campaign, but not to a significant degree.\u201d There must have been some uncomfortable dinner parties.</p> <p>Alaric stayed away from political party membership until David Cameron was elected leader of the Conservatives in 2005. \u201cI quite liked Cameron.\u201d He joined the party. Why? \u201cI don\u2019t know. Because I\u2019m unorthodox? I used to describe myself as a Tory Trot. I just thought Labour was irredeemably awful. And I always got on with Tories \u2013 they\u2019re able to think for themselves, whereas in Labour just follow the line. But I was never active.\u201d</p> <p>When the MPs\u2019 expenses scandal erupted in 2009, Alaric left party politics again. \u201cI thought, Christ, these people \u2013 all of them \u2013 are awful. It was back to stasis.\u201d</p> <p>But three years ago, the issue of Europe focused his mind. \u201cFor most of my life, I\u2019ve tried to avoid single-issue politics. You get tunnel vision. But I didn\u2019t like the European Commission behaving like a nation state in its own right.

      "bodyText": "Forty years ago, in the autumn of 1979, I was 20 years old and a new graduate from the Polytechnic of Central London (PCL). I was active in the Anti-Nazi League and the Socialist Workers party, joining demonstrations and picket lines and attending earnest meetings in dingy pubs. I\u2019d just started my first job as a trainee journalist. I was living with my boyfriend on the notorious North Peckham estate in south London. The boyfriend was also a member of the SWP and a dominant figure in PCL\u2019s student union, first as the editor of the student paper, and then \u2013 twice \u2013 as president. Alaric Bamping had a reputation as a leftwing firebrand, leading sit-ins and protests and conducting long, fierce arguments with anyone who disagreed with him. So how the hell, 40 years on, has he ended up as a parliamentary candidate for the Brexit party? Nearly everyone shifts over the years: I ceased parroting ultra-left rhetoric in the early 1980s, and I\u2019m more inclined to gentle reform than revolution these days. But Brexit and the fracturing of traditional tribes and loyalties has exposed and exacerbated our political journeys, sometimes causing acrimonious or painful rifts within families and testing friendships to destruction. Another friend from my student days alerted me to Alaric\u2019s news. \u201cWhat happened to swing him from the far left in PCL days to far right now?\u201d he asked in a text. It\u2019s a good question; I went to find out. Alaric and I parted in early 1982; neither of us could recall the exact date or circumstances. Last week, at the kitchen table of the north London house he shares with his wife, Julia Hobsbawm, the daughter of the acclaimed Marxist historian Eric Hobsbawm, we first caught up on the personal stuff. The 1980s and 1990s were \u201call a bit messy\u201d, he said. For a while, he maintained two simultaneous relationships, producing two children with one partner, before finally settling down with Julia \u2013 also a former PCL student \u2013 with whom he had three more children. Throughout, he ran \u201ca couple of businesses\u201d \u2013 antiquarian books and student property rentals \u2013 but mainly shouldered responsibility for childcare while his partners pursued their careers. In 1985, five years after he \u201cfell out\u201d with the SWP, he joined the Labour party and became a constituency political officer in east London. It didn\u2019t last; he \u201cdrifted away\u201d a few years later. By 1997, he was back with Julia, whose PR company Hobsbawm Macaulay Communications was then at the heart of the New Labour project. She founded the company with her old school friend, Sarah Macaulay, who married Gordon Brown in 2000. In Alaric and Julia\u2019s downstairs loo, along with a photograph of Brown and another of Julia receiving an OBE at Buckingham Palace a few years ago, hangs a framed graphic from the Guardian in May 1997. Headlined The In-crowd, it shows the \u201cintricate amalgam of friends and advisers of Tony Blair\u201d. Julia Hobsbawm and Sarah Macaulay are at the centre of the web. The old school friends have long since fallen out. \u201cI didn\u2019t help,\u201d said Alaric. \u201cI avoided Gordon Brown like the plague. I was around them, but I was considered awkward squad. I didn\u2019t really like the Blairites at all, they didn\u2019t appeal to me. I was on the edge of the Stop The War campaign, but not to a significant degree.\u201d There must have been some uncomfortable dinner parties. Alaric stayed away from political party membership until David Cameron was elected leader of the Conservatives in 2005. \u201cI quite liked Cameron.\u201d He joined the party. Why? \u201cI don\u2019t know. Because I\u2019m unorthodox? I used to describe myself as a Tory Trot. I just thought Labour was irredeemably awful. And I always got on with Tories \u2013 they\u2019re able to think for themselves, whereas in Labour just follow the line. But I was never active.\u201d When the MPs\u2019 expenses scandal erupted in 2009, Alaric left party politics again. \u201cI thought, Christ, these people \u2013 all of them \u2013 are awful. It was back to stasis.\u201d But three years ago, the issue of Europe focused his mind. \u201cFor most of my life, I\u2019ve tried to avoid single-issue politics. You get tunnel vision. But I didn\u2019t like the European Commission behaving like a nation state in its own right. There was no ambiguity in my mind that we should leave, and leave on World Trade rules.\u201d He placed several bets on Leave winning the referendum. \u201cOn the morning, the bookies were offering 7-1 against. I couldn\u2019t believe my luck.\u201d He wagered some more money before heading to the Groucho Club for a referendum party, where there were \u201cprobably four Leavers among about 200 Remainers\u201d. How did he feel when the result came through? \u201cVindicated.\u201d And rich? \u201cRicher than I had been in the morning.\u201d He wouldn\u2019t say how much he won.

They want to get on with things like investing in our health service, our schools, tackling the climate emergency \u2013 things the Liberal Democrats want to do \u2013 and they want to therefore have finality, and we would offer that.\u201d Denying that his party\u2019s position simply made them the \u201cmirror image\u201d of no-deal Brexiters, Davey insisted that such a position would allow the Lib Dems to tackle what he said were the causes of the Brexit vote, such as inequality and left-behind communities. \u201cWhile we have got this nightmare going on in parliament we can\u2019t deal with those problems,\u201d he said. On Friday, Jo Swinson, the leader of the Lib Dems, said she would not support a Jeremy Corbyn-led Labour government. But Davey said that in the event of a hung parliament his party would be willing to back Labour\u2019s call for a second referendum, or any other policies that match those in a Lib Dem manifesto. Davey said the party would be willing to work with the Conservatives again. \u201cLet\u2019s remember we had a coalition with [the Tories],\u201d he said. If Lib Dem members back the leadership\u2019s move, revoking article 50 would be written into the party\u2019s next election manifesto. Swinson is expected to take questions from conference delegates on Sunday, after a speech by her predecessor, Sir Vince Cable. Swinson\u2019s main speech will be on Tuesday. The recent reappearance on the campaign trail of a peer accused of sexual harassment has caused controversy. Bridget Harris, a former leading party aide who worked for Nick Clegg, accused the Lib Dems of ignoring women\u2019s safety after Chris Rennard was allowed to campaign in the recent Brecon and Radnorshire byelection. Harris, one of four women who accused Rennard of sexual harassment in 2013, told the Times: \u201cI can\u2019t believe the Lib Dems are prepared to set aside the safety of women and the sense of confidence that women have in their political system for the sake of a guy who is prepared to go canvassing for them in a byelection.\u201d A report found that Swinson and other senior Lib Dems had erred in handling the allegations informally. A 2014 inquiry by Alistair Webster QC found evidence that Rennard had violated the \u201cpersonal space and autonomy\u201d of several female activists. Rennard has always denied the allegations. The recent defection from the Conservatives of Philip Lee, who abstained in the vote on equal marriage and argued that immigrants should show they do not have HIV or hepatitis B before being allowed into the UK, has caused a separate row, with the head of the Lib Dems\u2019 LGBT group quitting in protest.",

Instead it\u2019s an utterly articulate clear-sightedness that lets each one deliver a shock: \u201cMy poem cannot return / all of your losses, / not even some of them \u2026 I don\u2019t know why the birds / sing / during their crossings / over our ruins\u201d says \u201cMy Poem Will Not Save You\u201d. Mikhail, who lives in the US, was born in Baghdad. The tragedies of recent and not so recent Iraqi history and the traditions of Arabic verse are the steely structures that underpin her profoundly thought-through work of witness. Selima Hill\u2019s I May Be Stupid But I\u2019m Not That Stupid (Bloodaxe, \u00a39.95) shows that she, like Oswald, is a pioneer of vividly disobedient verse. Her substantial new book brings together six sequences of characteristically short four and six-line poems. Funny and dark, Hill is always a danger to herself and others with her poems of psychic injury and revenge, and here she is at her gadfly best. Like all these books, it\u2019s one give to anyone who doubts the usefulness of artistic fury. \u2022 Fiona Sampson\u2019s Come Down (Little, Brown) will be published in February.",

For most of my childhood, when we returned from our annual caravan holiday, we would drive past the \u201cLeicestershire\u201d sign and a few yards on, drive past one that said \u201cRutland\u201d. Every time the council took the Rutland sign down, it was re-erected by activists. After a sustained campaign, Rutland became a county again in 1997 and \u201cMultum in parvo\u201d, much-in-little, remains its local motto. I remember being comforted by this as a child. I was little, but I was going to do great things. When I wasn\u2019t hiding in my book den, I was in the local library, which had the great virtue of being warm. I don\u2019t eat pork pies that often now but when I do, I have my very own Proustian moment, back to discarding the jelly on a Saturday teatime, the battered paperbacks I hid in my anorak pocket \u2013 and the image of my grandparents meeting at the Dickinson &amp; Morris bakery. \u2022 Platform Seven by Louise Doughty is published by Faber (\u00a314.99).

      "bodyText": "A fashion season can be defined as much by the people on the catwalk as it can by the clothes they are wearing. This time around, a key moment came at the end of Marc Jacobs\u2019 New York show, when an almost makeup-free Christy Turlington made a rare return to the catwalk, aged 50 (she also stars, with the designer himself, in the label\u2019s AW ad campaign). While this is hardly ancient in the real world, it is in modelling, where the average catwalk model is around 18. A few days later, Simone Rocha arguably upped the ante. The 32-year-old\u2019s show \u2013 in part inspired by Louise Bourgeois, who lived until she was 98 \u2013 featured models in their 30s and 40s, including cult favourite Jeny Howorth and actor Chlo\u00eb Sevigny. Of course, the motives for this are not entirely pure. The over-50s account for around 47% of all UK consumer spending, according to figures from 2015, and if their financial clout has been dubbed the \u201cgrey pound\u201d by the retail world, it\u2019s an even more dazzling silver in beauty.

      "bodyText": "On 31 March 2016, an urgent call went out from the president of the rugby section of the Yokohama Country &amp; Athletic Club. The guest speaker at a gala dinner at the club planned for 2 April had pulled out and a replacement was needed. The problem was this was no ordinary dinner. It was the centrepiece of a weekend celebrating 150 years of rugby in Japan, which arrived in the country five years before the creation of the Rugby Football Union. More of the emergency stand-in later but fast forward to last week as Japan kickstarted its buildup to the World Cup with the unveiling of a memorial plaque in Yokohama\u2019s Chinatown area, close to where the then Yokohama Foot Ball Club held its first meeting. \u201cBuilding the monument will help create a new [understanding of] history in Yokohama, with the city expected to draw attention from the world in two weeks,\u201d the Kanagawa governor Yuji Kuroiwa said. The plaque was official confirmation from those who run the game that Japan\u2019s rugby history was considerably older than previously recognised, while the ceremony was a fitting start to the festivities for the World Cup, the origins of which are as blurred by urban myth as the birth of the game in Japan. The late Katsuhiko Oku, a diplomat with the United Nations who had played rugby for Oxford University, is often credited as being the first person to lobby for Japan to host a World Cup in his role as a member of the international committee of the JRFU. However, his hopes were known to only a few and were certainly not official policy until 2003, the same year Oku was assassinated in Iraq. The reality was apparently a slightly more off-the-cuff move. \u201cI remember [former] chairman Nobby Mashimo wanted to say something \u201cbig\u201d at a new year\u2019s speech [to the press] in 2003,\u201d says Koji Tokumasu, a director of the World Cup 2019 organising committee. \u201cI suggested he say Japan wants to host the World Cup. I called [former International Rugby Board chief executive] Mike Miller and asked what he thought. He said: \u2018It\u2019s not impossible\u2019 \u2013 and it sort of went from there.\u201d Japan lost out to New Zealand for the right to host the 2011 World Cup. Despair, however, turned to joy when Japan was awarded this year\u2019s tournament, turning the spotlight on the sport in the country and prompting renewed delving into its origins. The long-accepted view had always been that the sport was first introduced to Japan by Edward Bramwell Clarke and Ginnosuke Tanaka to students at Keio University. The two Cambridge graduates wanted to give their students something constructive to do to \u201ckeep them from idling and wasting the lovely autumn weather\u201d and started a rugby club in 1899. On 7 December 1901, Keio played the YC&amp;AC \u2013 an amalgamation of the Yokohama football (rugby), athletics, baseball, cricket and tennis clubs \u2013 and the sport eventually spread to some of the other top educational establishments. A memorial stone at Shimogamo Shrine in Kyoto marks the spot where rugby was first played in the Kansai area in 1910, and such was the quick spread of the sport that the national high school championship was first contested in 1917. In 1926 the Japan Rugby Football Union was formed, and four years later the national team \u2013 coached by Shigeru Kayama, who had played for Harlequins during a trip in London as the attendant to Prince Chichibu \u2013 played its first overseas matches on a tour to Canada in 1930, drawing 3-3 with British Columbia in a game the JRFU designated as a Test. Two years later, Japan hosted its first Test match when the home side defeated Canada 9-8 in Osaka. In 1948 the national corporate championship began with three teams vying for the title. The competition continued until 2003 when it was absorbed by the Top League. But back to the early days, and historian Mike Galbraith has proved that the \u201cKeio story\u201d is not 100% accurate when it comes to the origins of rugby in Japan and his research has shown that \u201cfootball\u201d was being played in Japan as early as 1863, the year cricket was formally introduced to the country. \u201cI am very glad that my efforts bore fruit 10 years after I discovered the history,\u201d Galbraith told reporters after the unveiling of the plaque in September. According to Galbraith, Sir Harry Holdsworth Rawson, the governor-general of New South Wales in Australia, gave a speech in 1908 describing the first game of cricket in Japan \u2013 \u201cA remarkable feature of which was the fact that half the players were playing football.\u201d That game was played between a Royal Navy team drawn from officers on ships sent to protect British expats in Japan and those under their protection following a declaration by Shogun Tokugawa Iemochi that foreigners who ignored his order to leave Japan should be killed. With the garrison at Yokohama strengthened, it soon became commonplace for the soldiers stationed there to play rugby against civilians \u2013 who may well have included Clarke\u2019s father who was a baker in the small port town \u2013 culminating two years later in the formation of the Yokohama Foot Ball Club. \u201cAs we happen to have two or three Rugby and Winchester men in the community, we may be certain that we shall have really good scientific play,\u201d said an editorial in the Japan Times dated 26 January 1866. Hence the dinner 150 years later and the urgent call for a guest speaker who could represent the history of rugby in Japan. A history that incorporated its expat beginnings, its development and the eventual rise of the national team to one that caused one of the biggest upsets sport has ever seen with the win over South Africa at the 2015 World Cup. There was really only one man who could fit the bill and as luck would have it a former Tokai University, Suntory Sungoliath and Japan head coach landed in Tokyo just a few hours after the call went out. Perhaps wanting to make up for the duck he scored for a Chairman\u2019s XI against the Japan national cricket side in the 2013 game commemorating 150 years of cricket in Japan, Eddie Jones, fresh off winning the grand slam in the Six Nations with England, agreed to attend the dinner. The guests, including local politicians, sports dignitaries and a number of past players who had flown in from all over the globe, had not, however, been told of the last-minute change of speaker and the look of astonishment and joy on their faces as Jones took to the stage was one to behold. \u201cThat\u2019s what rugby is all about,\u201d he said when asked why he had no hesitation in giving up some of the little free time he had on his short trip back to Japan. It is fair to say, with close to 500,000 foreign fans expected to hit Japanese shores for the World Cup, that not only local rugby fans but the population as a whole are about to get their own taste of what rugby is all about.",

      "body": "<p>Melissa McCarthy, Elisabeth Moss and Tiffany Haddish are kicking back in the Warner Bros commissary, discussing an American delicacy that, strangely, does not appear on the menu: \u201cI taught them about pickles and Kool-Aid,\u201d says Haddish proudly, as her two castmates erupt in squeals of revolted laughter.</p> <p>\u201cThat shows the true love I have for you,\u201d says McCarthy. \u201cBecause I kept saying no and she kept saying: \u2018You have to try it!\u2019 I was like: \u2018I. Don\u2019t. Want. To. Do. This.\u2019 And then the next thing I know, I was eating it and \u2026 \u201d Here, McCarthy, a Saturday Night Live regular and veteran of several blockbuster comedies, pauses before the punchline lands: \u201c \u2026 it was awful!\u201d</p> <p>Haddish shakes her head sadly: \u201cI tried to share with y\u2019all poor people food, but you \u2026 it\u2019s all good.</p> <p>\u201cI was poor! We didn\u2019t eat that!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t grow up in the hood, though.\u201d</p> <p>Mercifully, perhaps, neither this culinary experiment nor any others are featured in The Kitchen. Instead, the title of their new film is taken from the DC comic-book series on which it\u2019s based. It refers both to Hell\u2019s Kitchen, the traditionally Irish neighbourhood of Manhattan where their characters run a protection racket after their gangster husbands are sent to prison, and also to the 1970s domestic servitude that all the men seem to wish they would scuttle back to. No chance, pal.</p> <p>\u201cI think that this specific story was my story to tell,\u201d said director Andrea Berloff firmly when we spoke earlier that day. Berloff has been working steadily as a screenwriter since 2006\u2019s World Trade Center, picking up an Oscar nomination for the 2015 NWA biopic Straight Outta Compton, and was originally hired to adapt The Kitchen for the screen. This time, though, she put herself forward to direct as well.</p> <p>Now Berloff says she is determined to direct her next script, too, but will she get the chance? A few days after we meet, The Kitchen goes on general release in the US and \u2013 fairly predictably, for anyone familiar with the ways of Hollywood \u2013 it is poorly reviewed. Subsequently, industry paper Variety publishes a piece analysing the film\u2019s disappointing box office, in which a Warner Bros exec is quoted saying: \u201cIn the case of this story, we took bold choices that didn\u2019t pan out for us.\u201d It is hard not to read this as a signal that it\u2019s back to male-dominated business as usual.</p> <p>Moss, 37, Haddish, 39, and McCarthy, 49, are three actors all at the peak of their powers, and all very different. Moss is a sunny-natured, self-described \u201cValley girl\u201d who\u2019s been in the biz since childhood and has the Scientology levels to prove it. Fame is much fresher for Haddish, who spent much of her childhood on the other side of LA, in South Central foster homes, before parlaying a social worker\u2019s suggestion into a superstar standup career. She\u2019s now busily shooting \u201cabout 19\u201d movies back to back, like someone who well understands how short-lived the good times can be. McCarthy is a little older, a little calmer; an Illinois farm girl-turned-savvy film-maker who co-produces many of her own blockbuster comedies with her husband of 14 years, Ben Falcone, and regularly appears in Top 10 lists of Hollywood\u2019s best-paid actresses. Last year, she added a best actress Oscar nomination to her achievements.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zv8VrBh61c\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-zv8VrBh61c?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>What the three share is a popular appeal that is rooted in talent and not weighted towards looks. That would be an impressive feat for any screen actor, but it is particularly so for women in Hollywood. As McCarthy\u2019s character Kathy tells her children in one memorable scene from The Kitchen: \u201cPretty doesn\u2019t matter; it\u2019s just a tool women can use.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI love that line,\u201d says McCarthy now, although she is not sure she entirely agrees with it. \u201cI don\u2019t apply that to my life. Not meaning I am or I am not [pretty], it\u2019s just like, I hope my words mean more than my hairdo.\u201d</p> <p>This take-it-or-leave-it attitude to the male gaze seems to make them all particularly beloved by female audiences. McCarthy and Haddish began their current winning streaks with Bridesmaids (2011) and Girls Trip (2017), respectively, two female-fronted comedies that were said to usher in a new era by proving the box-office bankability of women. Moss\u2019s feminist credentials, meanwhile, rest on her lead role in The Handmaid\u2019s Tale and, before that, playing career gal Peggy Olson in Mad Men. Despite that, a high proportion of those were created and directed by men.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s irrelevant,\u201d says Haddish. \u201cYou just want somebody good,\u201d says McCarthy. \u201c[Andrea] always made us feel, I think, that it was our film that we were doing,\u201d says Moss. \u201cShe was with us and we were with her, and we were making it together; we were the four kind of constants. That\u2019s very rare in any director \u2013 man or woman \u2013 so that was, I think, a quality that I really valued.\u201d</p> <p>Speaking of collaboration, do they reckon they\u2019ve got what it takes to run a protection racket? Haddish answers without hesitation: \u201cHell, yeah!\u201d And you believe her too; no one could survive the ordeals outlined in her 2017 memoir, The Last Black Unicorn, without learning how to take control of a situation. Moss mulls it over more earnestly: \u201cAh \u2026 noooo. Probably not. I think I\u2019d \u2026 nah \u2026 Well? Definitely not with the killing.\u201d While McCarthy offers up the most \u201cmidwestern mom\u201d take imaginable: \u201cLike I\u2019ve said before with my kids, I think embarrassment goes a long way. I don\u2019t want to kill anybody but if it\u2019s like, you show up and just embarrass the bejesus out of someone? I tell you what, they\u2019re only gonna have that happen a coupla times \u2026 \u201d</p> <p>The Kitchen makes space for such differing perspectives. In the DC original, all three women are white Irish-Americans, but that didn\u2019t feel right to Berloff. The film also engages with what it might have been like for Haddish\u2019s character to be a black woman living within a white community in the 70s, in a way that becomes intrinsic to the plot. That\u2019s to Berloff\u2019s credit, says Haddish: \u201cI was like: \u2018Maybe, let\u2019s just play it, let\u2019s not even acknowledge [race].\u2019 And Andrea was like: \u2018Oh no, we\u2019re gonna acknowledge it.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>There are also some great male character actors involved, including Domhnall Gleeson, Common and Bill Camp, and Berloff insists that it\u2019s \u201cabsolutely\u201d a story made for men, too. \u201cWell, listen, I genuinely believe that women have been going to see male-driven movies for a hundred years and that there\u2019s no reason men can\u2019t sit in a theatre and watch amazing actresses do their work.\u201d</p> <p>There is no reason, of course, and yet those same hundred years have socialised women to empathise with men\u2019s stories, while male audiences have very rarely been required to make an equivalent imaginative leap. The evidence is at the box office, where poor reviews don\u2019t always dent a male-fronted film\u2019s opening weekend. Wasn\u2019t Bridesmaids supposed to have changed all this? \u201cI just wasn\u2019t that shocked by it,\u201d says McCarthy, in reference to that film\u2019s commercial success. \u201cI do think there are a lot of people that are verbally \u2013 and, I think, in their hearts \u2013 supporting this equality movement, but you\u2019ve got to put your money where your mouth is. You have to show up and make it count at the box office or it will go away. And that\u2019s a very, very scary thing. Not just because we\u2019re in the business, but to say you\u2019re going to stop representing women, 50% of the population, because they\u2019re not worth telling stories about? That hurts my heart as a mother of two girls.\u201d</p> <p>Like the proverbial Kool-Aid-coated pickle, then, The Kitchen clearly is not going to be to everyone\u2019s taste, but that\u2019s exactly why it\u2019s important to give it a try when offered. What does it say about us if we\u2019re not even willing to do that?</p> <p><em>The Kitchen is in cinemas from </em><em>Friday 20 September</em></p>",

That\u2019s to Berloff\u2019s credit, says Haddish: \u201cI was like: \u2018Maybe, let\u2019s just play it, let\u2019s not even acknowledge [race].\u2019 And Andrea was like: \u2018Oh no, we\u2019re gonna acknowledge it.\u2019\u201d There are also some great male character actors involved, including Domhnall Gleeson, Common and Bill Camp, and Berloff insists that it\u2019s \u201cabsolutely\u201d a story made for men, too. \u201cWell, listen, I genuinely believe that women have been going to see male-driven movies for a hundred years and that there\u2019s no reason men can\u2019t sit in a theatre and watch amazing actresses do their work.\u201d There is no reason, of course, and yet those same hundred years have socialised women to empathise with men\u2019s stories, while male audiences have very rarely been required to make an equivalent imaginative leap. The evidence is at the box office, where poor reviews don\u2019t always dent a male-fronted film\u2019s opening weekend. Wasn\u2019t Bridesmaids supposed to have changed all this? \u201cI just wasn\u2019t that shocked by it,\u201d says McCarthy, in reference to that film\u2019s commercial success. \u201cI do think there are a lot of people that are verbally \u2013 and, I think, in their hearts \u2013 supporting this equality movement, but you\u2019ve got to put your money where your mouth is. You have to show up and make it count at the box office or it will go away. And that\u2019s a very, very scary thing. Not just because we\u2019re in the business, but to say you\u2019re going to stop representing women, 50% of the population, because they\u2019re not worth telling stories about? That hurts my heart as a mother of two girls.\u201d Like the proverbial Kool-Aid-coated pickle, then, The Kitchen clearly is not going to be to everyone\u2019s taste, but that\u2019s exactly why it\u2019s important to give it a try when offered. What does it say about us if we\u2019re not even willing to do that? The Kitchen is in cinemas from Friday 20 September",

      "bodyText": "Thousands of mourners sang the praises of Robert Mugabe on Saturday at the official funeral ceremony for the Zimbabwe\u2019s founding president in Harare. A military brass band led family members, officials from the ruling Zanu-PF party and foreign dignitaries from across Africa on a short parade across the grass of the national stadium in front of the coffin, which was draped in the national flag. Mugabe died earlier this month aged 95 in a clinic in Singapore. The South African president, Cyril Ramaphosa, was among the current and former heads of state to attend. Many in Zimbabwe have been critical of his handling of an outbreak of xenophobic violence in South Africa, and he was booed by some in the stadium A number of Zimbabwe\u2019s opposition leaders were also present. Job Sikhala said he had come to offer his condolences to the bereaved family. Walter Chidakwa, a relative of Mugabe, spoke first, and said the former guerrilla leader turned authoritarian ruler had loved his people. The service follows an announcement by his family and Zimbabwe\u2019s president, Emmerson Mnangagwa, that his burial will not take place for at least a month, until his mausoleum has been built at the National Heroes Acre monument. Mugabe\u2019s death has left Zimbabwe torn over the legacy of his 37-year rule, which was marked by repression and economic crisis. He died almost two years after former army loyalists forced him out of office in 2017 following a power struggle over what was widely perceived as his bid to have his wife, Grace, succeed him. His body was returned from Singapore on Wednesday to a country still struggling with inflation and food and fuel shortages caused by decades of economic mismanagement. \u201cDespite certain misgivings, within certain quarters about his so-called mistakes ... the government\u2019s position is clear,\u201d the foreign minister, Sibusiso Moyo, told Agence France-Presse. \u201cThe late President Mugabe is an icon.\u201d Mugabe ended white-minority rule in Zimbabwe and improved access to education and health services for the country\u2019s poor black majority, but he soon began to resort to fear and repression to govern. Many Zimbabweans will remember Mugabe more for his economic mismanagement and increasingly tyrannical rule that followed the initial hope of liberation. Millions fled the country to escape decades of hyperinflation and crackdowns on dissidents. Many are struggling to survive in the post-Mugabe era. \u201cThings were much better under Comrade Mugabe, prices of basics were lower,\u201d said Daydream Goba, 27. \u201cNow, we can barely manage.\u201d Mugabe\u2019s funeral arrangements were also the subject of a dispute between Mnangagwa and the family over where and when the former leader should be buried. His family are still bitter over the role Mnangagwa played in his ousting and had pushed for Mugabe to be buried in his homestead of Zvimba, north-west of Harare. A former guerrilla who fought alongside Mugabe against colonial forces, Mnangagwa was fired as first vice-president and branded a traitor. Protesters and military officers pressured Mugabe to step down soon after, in what was widely seen as a struggle between Mnangagwa\u2019s faction and loyalists to Grace inside the ruling Zanu-PF party. The \u201cheroes\u201d monument, where more than 130 national figures are buried in black marble tombs, sits on a hilltop overlooking Harare. Mugabe\u2019s first wife, Sally, is also buried there.",

Born in 1967, the year his country\u2019s occupation of the West Bank and Gaza began, Keret belongs to a generation that is cynical about prospects for peace. He shows us characters trying to get on with their ordinary lives against a background hum of conflict and violence, like the man in \u201cOne Gram Short\u201d whose attempts to buy cannabis are frustrated because war in Syria has shut down his dealer\u2019s supply route through Lebanon.</p> <p>When Keret does address political questions, he does so from an oblique angle.

One boy is a copy of Hitler, raised so that a Holocaust survivor can take revenge by killing him; but the boy doesn\u2019t know he\u2019s Hitler and simply longs to be free. There\u2019s no mention of the Palestinians in the story \u2013 or in this collection \u2013 but the absurdity of punishing one group of people for the suffering of another is powerfully evoked.</p> <p>Although the tales are divided between five translators (Sondra Silverston, Nathan Englander, Jessica Cohen, Miriam Shlesinger and Yardenne Greenspan), each captures Keret\u2019s dry, almost clinical style superbly.

      "body": "<p>I went to a school in Pakistan\u2019s Punjab province called government primary school, Chak 2/4-L. Chak means village; 2/4-L is the name of my village, 2/4 the number of the canal feed that irrigates it, and L because it\u2019s on the left side of the canal. Most villages along the canal had named themselves after a local legend or a landmark. We never bothered. I always assumed that our people were so hardworking they forgot to name where we lived.</p> <p>I don\u2019t mean to romanticise hard labour, but my people were always busy cultivating their land. The land was fertile, but fertile land requires even harder work: you must irrigate it at midnight and pick your vegetables before dawn. And there were rewards. If you owned two acres of land you could send your sons to university and give water buffaloes to your daughter in their dowry; if you had no acres but owned a buffalo you could still send your son to school and your daughter to a Qur\u2019an class.</p> <p>Whenever my mid-range landlord father got his occasional bout of agricultural ambition, he would use it for our character building; he would drag us out of our beds before dawn and make us pick vegetables \u2013 aubergines, okra, courgettes, all things we considered vile \u2013 and then, with baskets over our heads, make us walk to the vegetable market in the city. Agriculture was fabulous but unpredictable: sometimes you were on your way to the vegetable market with your baskets, and the returning farmers would tell you the abysmal market rates and you would dump your vegetables on the roadside and go home. Produce you had worked for four months to grow would rot on the roadside.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6f58869ac2e566855f7cd51fc433d98a94d3274a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6f58869ac2e566855f7cd51fc433d98a94d3274a/375_0_5625_3376/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Water buffaloes in the canal.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Water buffaloes in the canal.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Faizan Ahmad</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Everyone realised there was more money in real estate than growing aubergines and okra. Over the years, I have felt a yearning for the places lost to property dealers \u2013 a favourite guava orchard, a pond covered in turquoise moss \u2013 and then I have admonished myself. Do you really expect this place to stay frozen in time and wait for Hanif sahib\u2019s annual visit?</p> <p>When the first private school opened in my village, I boasted that nobody would send their child there. The city was next door and had enough private schools, and what was wrong with government primary anyway? On my next visit I saw people with four kids on a motorcycle, and a dozen on a donkey cart, all dropping them off at the private school gate.</p> <p>People who sold their land bought Toyota Corollas and converted their mud houses into concrete beauties. Many put up a plaque in Arabic that read, aptly: this is my Maker\u2019s blessing. After a few years, the money ran out, those Corollas were sold, and the ex-farmers started selling mobile phone cards and fizzy drinks and crisps from tiny shops carved out of their homes.

      "bodyText": "I went to a school in Pakistan\u2019s Punjab province called government primary school, Chak 2/4-L. Chak means village; 2/4-L is the name of my village, 2/4 the number of the canal feed that irrigates it, and L because it\u2019s on the left side of the canal. Most villages along the canal had named themselves after a local legend or a landmark. We never bothered. I always assumed that our people were so hardworking they forgot to name where we lived. I don\u2019t mean to romanticise hard labour, but my people were always busy cultivating their land. The land was fertile, but fertile land requires even harder work: you must irrigate it at midnight and pick your vegetables before dawn. And there were rewards. If you owned two acres of land you could send your sons to university and give water buffaloes to your daughter in their dowry; if you had no acres but owned a buffalo you could still send your son to school and your daughter to a Qur\u2019an class. Whenever my mid-range landlord father got his occasional bout of agricultural ambition, he would use it for our character building; he would drag us out of our beds before dawn and make us pick vegetables \u2013 aubergines, okra, courgettes, all things we considered vile \u2013 and then, with baskets over our heads, make us walk to the vegetable market in the city. Agriculture was fabulous but unpredictable: sometimes you were on your way to the vegetable market with your baskets, and the returning farmers would tell you the abysmal market rates and you would dump your vegetables on the roadside and go home. Produce you had worked for four months to grow would rot on the roadside. Everyone realised there was more money in real estate than growing aubergines and okra. Over the years, I have felt a yearning for the places lost to property dealers \u2013 a favourite guava orchard, a pond covered in turquoise moss \u2013 and then I have admonished myself. Do you really expect this place to stay frozen in time and wait for Hanif sahib\u2019s annual visit? When the first private school opened in my village, I boasted that nobody would send their child there. The city was next door and had enough private schools, and what was wrong with government primary anyway? On my next visit I saw people with four kids on a motorcycle, and a dozen on a donkey cart, all dropping them off at the private school gate. People who sold their land bought Toyota Corollas and converted their mud houses into concrete beauties. Many put up a plaque in Arabic that read, aptly: this is my Maker\u2019s blessing. After a few years, the money ran out, those Corollas were sold, and the ex-farmers started selling mobile phone cards and fizzy drinks and crisps from tiny shops carved out of their homes. Most of the fertile agricultural land was turned into gated communities with tiny little parks for children\u2019s rides. In 2/4-L\u2019s march to progress I recall two key moments. When the first in-house toilets were built, I remember elders sneering: are we going to shit in our own house now? The second was my late mother, always non-judgmental and kind, getting furious when a neighbour started wearing the burqa: \u201cEverybody has seen her since she was a child \u2013 what is she trying to hide now?\u201d She could not have predicted what people would do in the village for a living.

I love the crisp air-con and pure anonymity. The snacks are atrocious, the staff sullenly dehumanising, and the tickets, all day every day, are a penny short of seven quid. As everything about Brexit has become incendiary, all news items confusing, all social media feeds angrily polarised, making the miners\u2019 dispute look like a period of warm societal cohesion by comparison, I have spent long periods in the dark. \u201cWell, you\u2019ll be first against the wall,\u201d several of you may be presently thinking, \u201cyou whining, fascist Marie-Antoinette bint!\u201d Well, quite. But at the multiplex, there is none of this anger. (I cannot vouch for rage levels at my local art-house independent, where entry is at least \u00a317 and an earnest film student will ferry a bespoke organic fudge sundae to your seat as you watch weighty Oscar 2020 contenders such as Parasite or The Souvenir.) It\u2019s the blockbusters that provide a refuge. As Spinal Tap\u2019s Nigel Tufnel says on his tour of Graceland: \u201cWell, it really puts perspective on things, though, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d \u201cToo much,\u201d sighs David St Hubbins. \u201cThere\u2019s too much fucking perspective now.\u201d Perhaps like me, right now, you do not have the bandwidth for perspective. Perhaps you are instead in the mood to see if Jason Statham can win a ninja battle against 12 assassins, accompanied by a score of Tha Movement &amp; Anonymouz ft Poetik and MC Arme. Fast &amp; Furious: Hobbs &amp; Shaw ticks this box. What else? The Queen\u2019s Corgi was a Belgian-animated pile of dog mess-scented will-this-do gubbins which left me feeling dizzy; but it stopped me worrying about whether I should stockpile groceries, medication and water. Or whether even thinking that is the hallmark of a hysteric? Or whether, if the worst happens, I will brave starvation-related civil unrest by just killing a lot of people as Gerard Butler does in the atrocious (ergo amazing) third part of the Lidl Jason Bourne franchise that is Angel Has Fallen? Midsommar, a horror film loosely depicting what happens if one takes mushrooms and gets lost in the Petersham Nurseries garden centre, positioned itself as a clever movie, but was actually soothingly daft. The Current War with Benedict Cumberbatch was 108 minutes of men in top hats bickering about lightbulbs, but also a good chance to hide while the nation came to terms with the word \u201cprorogue\u201d. Likewise Rocketman, in which Taron Egerton batters nonstop through Elton John hits, the perfect pick-me-up after I observed a mass social-media-blocking spree between friends, which started out about Brexit but slid into trans rights in the Trumpian era and concluded with a call to arms from both sides. Clearly neither side would be committing violence themselves; they merely suggested that if someone bigger and harder punched a Brexiter, a Terf, a Nazi, a misogynist or a remoaner, well, it would only be understandable. Alas, all good things cannot last. Summer is over. The race to win prestigious trophies has begun. Film distributors will stop quietly pushing out stinkers that they were contractually obliged to show, instead unveiling the big guns. Here comes The Goldfinch, the adaptation of the epic Donna Tartt novel; Joker, with Joaquin Phoenix, about a standup comedian who turns psychopath; Judy, about Judy Garland, set to be one of the roles of Ren\u00e9e Zellweger\u2019s life. The forthcoming Bombshell stars Charlize Theron, Nicole Kidman and Margot Robbie, and is about sexual harassment and Fox News. These are films one will be required to have a strident view on. What\u2019s more, as the 92nd Academy Awards look set to be more political than ever, Hollywood will try to show that it really cares about climate change, gun control, #MeToo and a dozen other pressing issues through various sombre outfits and angry speeches. Stars should be able to use their celebrity to make important points; but for me, Oscars season is anything but an escape. I am awarding my summer 2019 prize for acting to Taylor-Johnson\u2019s member. It stole the entire movie. We live in interesting times, surrounded by idiots. Let\u2019s at least give credit to useful pricks.",

Firstly there is the unfamiliar stage itself. Not a single member of England\u2019s 31-man squad, for example, has ever played a senior Test in Japan, even if several of their coaches know it well. The humidity and changeable weather conditions could be a factor, particularly if <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/09/typhoon-leaves-england-stranded-at-airport-amid-world-cup-travel-chaos\" title=\"\">more big typhoons blow in</a>.

What works on the slower, cooler tracks of the northern hemisphere is not necessarily guaranteed to pay dividends in the land of the rising scrum. Among those to have reached that conclusion appears to be Eddie Jones. Not so long ago he was still backing Chris Robshaw, Dylan Hartley, Mike Brown et al, hoping they had one last sweat-soaked hurrah still in them. Latterly he has changed tack and may well field his so-called \u201ckamikaze kids\u201d \u2013 Tom Curry and Sam Underhill \u2013 in the same back-row. It makes sense: if referees clamp down harder on illegal clearouts at the breakdown, specialist, energetic ball clampers will grow even more essential.</p> \n<p>Which brings us to the wider question of who, from a tightly-bunched pack, is best equipped to lift the Webb Ellis Cup. A brief glance down the All Blacks forwards roster reinforces the sense there is no clear, runaway ante-post favourite. If Brodie Retallick was fully fit things might be different but the world\u2019s best lock may not be sighted before the knockout stages. In his absence New Zealand\u2019s pack looks mortal, which is the only encouragement their rivals ever need.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b7cec56c-9154-44d6-91dd-094e4e29e185\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>The finals</b><b><br></b></p>\n    <p><b>1987</b> New Zealand 29 France 9 <br><i> Eden Park, Auckland, NZ</i></p>\n    <p><b>1991</b>&nbsp;Australia 12 England 6 <br><i>Twickenham, London, England</i></p>\n    <p><b>1995</b>&nbsp;South Africa 15 New Zealand 12<br><i>Ellis Park, Johannesburg, SA&nbsp;</i></p>\n    <p><b>1999</b>&nbsp;Australia 35 France 12<br><i>Millennium Stadium, Cardiff, Wales</i></p>\n    <p><b>2003&nbsp;</b>England 20 Australia 17<br><i>Telstra Stadium, Sydney, Aus&nbsp;</i></p>\n    <p><b>2007&nbsp;</b>South Africa 15 England 6<br><i>Stade de France, Paris, France&nbsp;</i></p>\n    <p><b>2011</b>&nbsp;New Zealand 8 France 7<br><i>Eden Park, Auckland, NZ&nbsp;</i></p>\n    <p><b>2015</b>&nbsp;New Zealand 34 Australia 17 <br><i>Twickenham, London, England&nbsp;</i></p>\n    <p><b>Top points-scorer&nbsp;</b><b>(all time) \u2013 277<br></b>Jonny Wilkinson <i>England</i> (1999-2011)</p>\n    <p><b>Most points in one tournament \u2013 126<br></b>Grant Fox&nbsp;<i>New Zealand </i>(1987)</p>\n    <p><b>Most points last time round \u2013 97<br></b>Nicol\u00e1s S\u00e1nchez <i>Argentina</i></p>\n    <p><b>Most points ever: team \u2013 2,302<br></b>New Zealand (next: Australia \u2013 1,645)</p>\n    <p><b>Most points by a team in a single match \u2013 145<br></b>New Zealand 145 Japan 17 (1995)</p>\n    <p><b>\u2026 also, from the same match: biggest hauls \u2026<br></b>Most points: Simon Culhane&nbsp;<i>New Zealand </i>\u2013 45<br>Most conversions: Culhane again \u2013 20<br>Most tries \u2013 individual: Marc Ellis \u2013 6</p>\n    <p><b>However, biggest winning margin \u2026 142<br></b>Australia 142 Namibia 0, 2003<br>\u2026 also the most tries by a team in a single match \u2013 22</p>\n    <p><b>Most tries (individual) \u2013 15<br></b>Bryan Habana <i>South Africa </i>&amp; Jonah Lomu <i>New Zealand</i></p>\n    <p><b>Most tries in a single tournament \u2013 8<br></b>Bryan Habana <i>South Africa, 2007<br></i>Jonah Lomu <i>New Zealand, 1999<br></i>Julian Savea <i>New Zealand, 2015</i></p>\n    <p><b>Most tries (team) \u2013 311<br></b>New Zealand (next: Australia \u2013 209)</p>\n    <p><b>Most conversions \u2013 58<br></b>Dan Carter <i>New Zealand</i></p>\n    <p><b>Most penalties and drop goals \u2013 58 and 14<br></b>Jonny Wilkinson \u2013 58 penalties, 14 drop goals</p>\n    <p><b>Most drop goals in a match \u2013 5<br></b>Jannie de Beer <i>South Africa v England 1999</i></p>\n    <p><b>Most matches played \u2013 22<br></b>Jason Leonard <i>England </i>&amp; Richie McCaw <i>New Zealand</i></p>\n    <p><b>Most tackles (individual) \u2013 225<br></b>Richie McCaw <i>New Zealand</i></p>\n    <p><b>Most tackles (team) \u2013 4,020<br></b>Australia (next: France \u2013 3,862)</p>\n    <p><b>RWC record attendance \u2013 89,867<br></b>Ireland 44 Romania 10 (<i>Wembley Stadium, 2015)</i></p>\n    <p><b>Host nations eliminated in group stages \u2013 2<br></b>England, 2015<br>Wales, 1991 (co-hosted with England, Scotland, Ireland and France)</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Already South Africa have given them a hurry-up by winning the Rugby Championship and the All Blacks will fly in with more question marks hanging over them than normal. No one is suggesting they are not genuine contenders but their opening pool game against the Springboks will be highly instructive. The Boks will start the tournament hard and fast and could easily puncture many casual assumptions from the outset.</p> \n<p>And if Rassie Erasmus\u2019s powerful pack do make an early impact, who is to say they cannot go all the way? The mind drifts to 2007 when, as now, they did not arrive as obvious favourites. All that changed after they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/sep/15/rugbyunion.rugbyworldcup20078\" title=\"\">pulverised England 36-0 in the pool stages</a> at the Stade de France, with a certain Jones having jumped aboard as a special consultant just a few weeks earlier. They went on to win the final, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/oct/21/rugbyunion.rugbyworldcup200710\" title=\"\">again at England\u2019s expense</a>, with a shell-shocked <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/oct/08/rugbyunion.rugbyworldcup200714\" title=\"\">New Zealand bowing out</a> in the quarter-finals.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"40bc1945cb5c9caa743a7c2a78b185f015202e6d\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/40bc1945cb5c9caa743a7c2a78b185f015202e6d/0_0_4431_2954/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mark Wilson of England during the Quilter Autumn International match between England and Italy at St. James\u2019s Park, Newcastle.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">England flopped as tournament hosts four years ago but Eddie Jones\u2019s 2019 squad will be among the contenders to win the World Cup.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Lishman/MI News/NurPhoto via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>There is a similar air of unpredictability this time. Would you put your mortgage on New Zealand topping their pool or both Wales and Australia breezing past Fiji? Anyone with the faintest knowledge of Fiji\u2019s twin attacking powerhouses Semi Radradra and Josua Tuisova knows the irresistible damage they could inflict. Then there is the host nation, lurking in the same pool as Scotland and Ireland. Japan will be competitive, relentless and motivated, at the very least.</p> \n<p>Much will depend on the avoidance of ruinous injuries but one ray of hope for the European challengers could lie in the increasingly important aerial battle. Few are better at regathering a high ball than Wales\u2019 Dan Biggar and even fewer can land a cross-kick on a sixpence more reliably than George Ford. South Africa may have a monster pack and a trio of outstanding 9s but their back three might not be entirely watertight beneath a well-directed greasy ball.</p> \n<p>The same charge could be levelled at England\u2019s composure under pressure when opponents stand up to their dynamic power game or pin them back in their own half. Their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/mar/16/england-scotland-six-nations-match-report\" title=\"\">second-half meltdown against Scotland</a> at Twickenham cannot be entirely dismissed as incidental and Jones has also had his forgettable moments. Not every player who has had dealings with England\u2019s single-minded head coach has loved the experience.</p> \n<p>But how many fans care about popularity versus their team winning a World Cup? The blunt truth is that Jones\u2019s England have precious little to beat in comparison with the last two ill-fated campaigns. In 2015 the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2015/oct/04/england-rugby-world-cup-stuart-lancaster-10-reasons\" title=\"\">host</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2015/oct/04/england-rugby-world-cup-stuart-lancaster-10-reasons\" title=\"\">s were out of their own World Cup after just over a fortnight</a>. Eight years ago they ended up mired in more off-field hassle than the other 19 teams combined. When people wonder why expectations of England are not currently sky-high, they have short memories.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"aab8422ba831c98dd7d4675a4b0dd23478c2e06a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aab8422ba831c98dd7d4675a4b0dd23478c2e06a/204_152_3088_2315/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wales tackle Bundee Aki during their warm-up defeat in Ireland.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Six Nations grand slam winners Wales will build their World Cup challenge on an exceptional defence.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phil Noble/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>For all that I still think they are good enough to reach the last four and, perhaps, go further still. To do so, however, they must defuse any number of booby traps, from Argentina and an unpredictable France in the pool to, potentially, Wales in a quarter-final and either the All Blacks or South Africa in a semi.</p> \n<p>Betting against Warren Gatland and Shaun Edwards in a sudden-death shootout is seldom wise; how much would those two gnarled gunslingers love to knock England out for the second tournament in a row?</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/07/ireland-wales-rugby-world-cup-warm-up-match-report\">Ireland top rankings after Wales are worn down and suffer fly-half blow</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The Welsh defence remains as impervious as any, they have excellent goalkickers and an enviable esprit de corps. They cannot, however, afford to suffer many more significant injuries, having already lost Taulupe Faletau and Gareth Anscombe. Defeat by the Wallabies in their second pool game will also heap an awful lot of pressure on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/mar/16/wales-crush-ireland-win-grand-slam-six-nations-match-report\" title=\"\">Six Nations grand slam winners</a> prior to their defining pool fixture against Fiji. They need their back row to cause persistent problems, Alun Wyn Jones to supply yet more inspiring leadership and both Liam Williams and Jonathan Davies to show their class.</p> \n<p>If the World Rugby rankings are to be believed, though, it is Ireland whom the rest of the world need to beat. Quite how they have ascended to the top having endured a distinctly patchy 2019 is not entirely clear but their more pressing priority will be to shut down Scotland in an opening Pool A game with massive implications for both sides. Ireland, for all their lofty billing, have not looked quite the same side since Joe Schmidt signalled his intention to step aside from the helm. Johnny Sexton, James Ryan and Robbie Henshaw are increasingly key men but they appear to be missing their injured openside Dan Leavy. Scotland? They will be fine until they bump into a dynamic, power-laden set of opposing forwards, at which point their admirable sense of adventure may not be enough. If they can somehow shock the Irish it is conceivable they will need only a narrow win to top the pool but, with either South Africa or New Zealand potentially awaiting in the quarter-finals, they will do very well to advance further.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4138\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Breakdown\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly rugby union email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>This, though, is the anything-can-happen World Cup.

Latterly he has changed tack and may well field his so-called \u201ckamikaze kids\u201d \u2013 Tom Curry and Sam Underhill \u2013 in the same back-row. It makes sense: if referees clamp down harder on illegal clearouts at the breakdown, specialist, energetic ball clampers will grow even more essential. Which brings us to the wider question of who, from a tightly-bunched pack, is best equipped to lift the Webb Ellis Cup. A brief glance down the All Blacks forwards roster reinforces the sense there is no clear, runaway ante-post favourite. If Brodie Retallick was fully fit things might be different but the world\u2019s best lock may not be sighted before the knockout stages. In his absence New Zealand\u2019s pack looks mortal, which is the only encouragement their rivals ever need. Already South Africa have given them a hurry-up by winning the Rugby Championship and the All Blacks will fly in with more question marks hanging over them than normal. No one is suggesting they are not genuine contenders but their opening pool game against the Springboks will be highly instructive. The Boks will start the tournament hard and fast and could easily puncture many casual assumptions from the outset. And if Rassie Erasmus\u2019s powerful pack do make an early impact, who is to say they cannot go all the way? The mind drifts to 2007 when, as now, they did not arrive as obvious favourites. All that changed after they pulverised England 36-0 in the pool stages at the Stade de France, with a certain Jones having jumped aboard as a special consultant just a few weeks earlier. They went on to win the final, again at England\u2019s expense, with a shell-shocked New Zealand bowing out in the quarter-finals. There is a similar air of unpredictability this time. Would you put your mortgage on New Zealand topping their pool or both Wales and Australia breezing past Fiji? Anyone with the faintest knowledge of Fiji\u2019s twin attacking powerhouses Semi Radradra and Josua Tuisova knows the irresistible damage they could inflict. Then there is the host nation, lurking in the same pool as Scotland and Ireland. Japan will be competitive, relentless and motivated, at the very least. Much will depend on the avoidance of ruinous injuries but one ray of hope for the European challengers could lie in the increasingly important aerial battle. Few are better at regathering a high ball than Wales\u2019 Dan Biggar and even fewer can land a cross-kick on a sixpence more reliably than George Ford. South Africa may have a monster pack and a trio of outstanding 9s but their back three might not be entirely watertight beneath a well-directed greasy ball. The same charge could be levelled at England\u2019s composure under pressure when opponents stand up to their dynamic power game or pin them back in their own half. Their second-half meltdown against Scotland at Twickenham cannot be entirely dismissed as incidental and Jones has also had his forgettable moments. Not every player who has had dealings with England\u2019s single-minded head coach has loved the experience. But how many fans care about popularity versus their team winning a World Cup? The blunt truth is that Jones\u2019s England have precious little to beat in comparison with the last two ill-fated campaigns. In 2015 the hosts were out of their own World Cup after just over a fortnight. Eight years ago they ended up mired in more off-field hassle than the other 19 teams combined. When people wonder why expectations of England are not currently sky-high, they have short memories. For all that I still think they are good enough to reach the last four and, perhaps, go further still. To do so, however, they must defuse any number of booby traps, from Argentina and an unpredictable France in the pool to, potentially, Wales in a quarter-final and either the All Blacks or South Africa in a semi. Betting against Warren Gatland and Shaun Edwards in a sudden-death shootout is seldom wise; how much would those two gnarled gunslingers love to knock England out for the second tournament in a row? The Welsh defence remains as impervious as any, they have excellent goalkickers and an enviable esprit de corps. They cannot, however, afford to suffer many more significant injuries, having already lost Taulupe Faletau and Gareth Anscombe. Defeat by the Wallabies in their second pool game will also heap an awful lot of pressure on the Six Nations grand slam winners prior to their defining pool fixture against Fiji. They need their back row to cause persistent problems, Alun Wyn Jones to supply yet more inspiring leadership and both Liam Williams and Jonathan Davies to show their class. If the World Rugby rankings are to be believed, though, it is Ireland whom the rest of the world need to beat. Quite how they have ascended to the top having endured a distinctly patchy 2019 is not entirely clear but their more pressing priority will be to shut down Scotland in an opening Pool A game with massive implications for both sides. Ireland, for all their lofty billing, have not looked quite the same side since Joe Schmidt signalled his intention to step aside from the helm. Johnny Sexton, James Ryan and Robbie Henshaw are increasingly key men but they appear to be missing their injured openside Dan Leavy. Scotland? They will be fine until they bump into a dynamic, power-laden set of opposing forwards, at which point their admirable sense of adventure may not be enough. If they can somehow shock the Irish it is conceivable they will need only a narrow win to top the pool but, with either South Africa or New Zealand potentially awaiting in the quarter-finals, they will do very well to advance further. This, though, is the anything-can-happen World Cup. Messrs Hansen, Gatland, Schmidt and Cheika could all have a surprise hidden up their track-suited sleeves but it would not surprise me if England and South Africa, as in 2007, turn out to be the last two sumo warriors left standing in Yokohama on 2 November. While the Boks currently look strong, Jones could yet enjoy the last laugh.",

This retreat, with rooms from \u00a320 a night, is purely for felines, especially those with a taste for the finer things in life. Lawlor Cat hotel, which opened in 2016, has 23 suites, all of which are booked out months in advance by cats <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/vaishti_the_vildechai/?hl=en\" title=\"\">such as Vaishti</a>, a persian chinchilla who has stayed five times in the past year, using the hotel\u2019s \u00a34-a-mile chauffeur service to and from her home in north London. \u201cShe listens to Andrea Bocelli during the journey. She melts when he sings and it keeps her calm,\u201d says her owner, Barry Lobel, 40, a tech company CEO. \u201cOnce she\u2019s there, I can log into the hotel\u2019s CCTV and see that she gets treated exactly the way she would at home: like royalty. She always comes back perfectly groomed and rested.\u201d</p> <p>Eric and Lenny, two rescue cats from Epping, also stay regularly and enjoy reiki therapy, watching cat-and-mice DVDs in the lobby and being read to. \u201cAfter an awful experience with a cat sitter, when Eric went missing and eventually came back emaciated, my husband and I found the hotel online. Now we\u2019ll only go on holiday if there\u2019s availability,\u201d says their owner, Sarah Waite. \u201cJane and her team understand the responsibility of looking after \u2018our children\u2019 \u2013 whatever Eric and Lenny want, they get. We\u2019ve just had artificial grass put down in our garden and have asked if they can have it in the living room \u2013 they love it.\u201d The cats have asked? She laughs: \u201cThat\u2019s how I talk about my boys!\u201d The spoiling doesn\u2019t stop there: at home, the cats are fed a 100% organic diet, made up of 75% fresh fish and meat. Although their last vet bill came to \u00a3800, Waite says she would \u201cpay anything to give them the best life\u201d.</p> <p>From food to fashion, holidays to healthcare, pets have never been so pampered, their care so aligned with what would be considered luxurious by human standards. A booming industry has emerged to meet the demands of their anthropomorphising owners. According to Mintel research, the value of pet-care products and services in the UK<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://www.petbusinessworld.co.uk/news/feed/pet-market-set-to-smash--2bn-barrier\" title=\"\">will reach \u00a32.1</a><a href=\"https://www.petbusinessworld.co.uk/news/feed/pet-market-set-to-smash--2bn-barrier\" title=\"\">b</a><a href=\"https://www.petbusinessworld.co.uk/news/feed/pet-market-set-to-smash--2bn-barrier\" title=\"\">n by 2023</a> \u2013 a 25% increase from an estimated \u00a31.7bn in 2018. Thanks to increasing pet ownership (40% of households have pets, according to the Pet Food Manufacturers Association), a new market in pet tech is thriving, offering wearable activity monitors and GPS trackers that allow owners to keep an eye on their pet\u2019s sleep, activity and calorie-burn. Meanwhile, smart enclosures (such as the \u00a3550 ZenCrate) will detect when a \u201cstressed\u201d animal enters, and play calming music or activate fans. Pet treats are evolving into indulgences close to human ones, from doggie facials to pet brunch.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ce297b2dbb6de55986e93ef7be246b5848203735\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ce297b2dbb6de55986e93ef7be246b5848203735/70_11_1534_1916/801.jpg\" alt=\"Persian chinchilla cat\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We\u2019re so in tune with how we look after our own wellbeing, it\u2019s definitely rubbing off on our pets.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Grace/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cPets give uncritical, unconditional love and comfort \u2013 and in difficult times, we project human qualities and emotions on to animals, to make ourselves feel better and less isolated,\u201d says Corinne Sweet, a British psychotherapist and author of The Anxiety Journal.

      "bodyText": "Jane Lawlor is giving me a tour of her Essex hotel. \u2018Most of our suites come with views of the pool or the rolling fields of the Brentwood countryside, and our evening turn-down service includes lighting flameless candles and leaving luxury pillow treats,\u2019 she says, handing me a glass of champagne in the hotel bar, where velvet sofas face a wood-burning stove. \u201cWe\u2019re all about relaxation and privacy here, so most guests like to eat in peace via room service, choosing anything from pan-crusted cod to lobster tail with caviar. And wait till you see the spa \u2013 we offer the latest treatments using award-winning products.\u201d Tempted to check-in? Well, I am afraid you can\u2019t \u2013 unless you are a cat. This retreat, with rooms from \u00a320 a night, is purely for felines, especially those with a taste for the finer things in life. Lawlor Cat hotel, which opened in 2016, has 23 suites, all of which are booked out months in advance by cats such as Vaishti, a persian chinchilla who has stayed five times in the past year, using the hotel\u2019s \u00a34-a-mile chauffeur service to and from her home in north London. \u201cShe listens to Andrea Bocelli during the journey. She melts when he sings and it keeps her calm,\u201d says her owner, Barry Lobel, 40, a tech company CEO. \u201cOnce she\u2019s there, I can log into the hotel\u2019s CCTV and see that she gets treated exactly the way she would at home: like royalty. She always comes back perfectly groomed and rested.\u201d Eric and Lenny, two rescue cats from Epping, also stay regularly and enjoy reiki therapy, watching cat-and-mice DVDs in the lobby and being read to. \u201cAfter an awful experience with a cat sitter, when Eric went missing and eventually came back emaciated, my husband and I found the hotel online. Now we\u2019ll only go on holiday if there\u2019s availability,\u201d says their owner, Sarah Waite. \u201cJane and her team understand the responsibility of looking after \u2018our children\u2019 \u2013 whatever Eric and Lenny want, they get. We\u2019ve just had artificial grass put down in our garden and have asked if they can have it in the living room \u2013 they love it.\u201d The cats have asked? She laughs: \u201cThat\u2019s how I talk about my boys!\u201d The spoiling doesn\u2019t stop there: at home, the cats are fed a 100% organic diet, made up of 75% fresh fish and meat. Although their last vet bill came to \u00a3800, Waite says she would \u201cpay anything to give them the best life\u201d. From food to fashion, holidays to healthcare, pets have never been so pampered, their care so aligned with what would be considered luxurious by human standards. A booming industry has emerged to meet the demands of their anthropomorphising owners. According to Mintel research, the value of pet-care products and services in the UK will reach \u00a32.1bn by 2023 \u2013 a 25% increase from an estimated \u00a31.7bn in 2018. Thanks to increasing pet ownership (40% of households have pets, according to the Pet Food Manufacturers Association), a new market in pet tech is thriving, offering wearable activity monitors and GPS trackers that allow owners to keep an eye on their pet\u2019s sleep, activity and calorie-burn. Meanwhile, smart enclosures (such as the \u00a3550 ZenCrate) will detect when a \u201cstressed\u201d animal enters, and play calming music or activate fans. Pet treats are evolving into indulgences close to human ones, from doggie facials to pet brunch. \u201cPets give uncritical, unconditional love and comfort \u2013 and in difficult times, we project human qualities and emotions on to animals, to make ourselves feel better and less isolated,\u201d says Corinne Sweet, a British psychotherapist and author of The Anxiety Journal. As the number of one-person households increases (the Office for National Statistics estimates that 26% of people in England will live alone by 2041), and more people work from home, pets are a powerful antidote to loneliness. \u201cWhile the relationship between human and animal goes back to the beginning of time, the modern phenomenon of treating them like \u2018mini-mes\u2019 shows just how stressed or alone many of us feel.\u201d Is there any human activity a pet now can\u2019t muscle in on? In the US \u201cbark mitzvah\u201d ceremonies, catered for by specialist bakeries, are popular, while some companies offer between 10 hours and a week\u2019s paid \u201cpawternity leave\u201d for new pet owners. Ikea\u2019s pet range currently features a sofa bed that can extend for \u201cpuppy sleepovers\u201d, while upmarket labels such as MiaCara sell minimalist pet furniture (Letto day bed, \u00a3797), alongside adventure products such as doggie sleeping bags and hiking boots. On Amazon, sales of memory foam pet beds are up 107% year on year, while doggy beer and ros\u00e9 wine gift sets are up 260%. \u201cPet owners want to have more shared experiences with their pets,\u201d an Amazon spokesperson says. \u201cThat might be at-home spa pampering days, snacking during movie night (Petface\u2019s Dog Deli chicken popcorn), joining the toast at their next celebration (Woof&amp;Brew\u2019s pawsecco freeze pops), or tucking into brunch with breakfast-specific pet food that includes yoghurt, berries and seeds (Lily\u2019s Kitchen Breakfast Crunch).\u201d Prudence, a bull terrier, and Mr Binks, a rescue dog, both enjoy social outings such as doggy brunch and doggy cinema, at which they get their own seat, blanket and ice-cream. \u201cI like taking them to different places for mental stimulation \u2013 I perish the thought that they would ever be bored,\u201d says their owner, Anna Webb, a broadcaster and dog trainer. \u201cThey get the latest toys and their outfits range from practical, outdoors-weather clothing to dressing-up costumes and cashmere sweaters. Their bedding is a mix of hemp blankets and plush faux fur.\u201d Not that they sleep in their beds: they share Webb\u2019s, with Prudence mimicking her and sleeping like a person, under the duvet with her head on a pillow. Is that not a bit much? \u201cI know it sounds bonkers, but why not embrace it? I don\u2019t think we\u2019re humanising animals any more than we have before \u2013 it\u2019s just the way we live now gives us more choice. That enriches the lives of my dogs, while strengthening the bond we share.\u201d It is not just dogs and cats; some rabbits, now the third-most popular pet in the UK, get the treatment, too. Fay Williams from Warrington calls herself a \u201cbunny mummy\u201d to \u201csuper-spoilt\u201d Olive. \u201cShe has her own room at the back of our house. When we go away, we book her into a retreat that specialises in looking after pampered rabbits. The owner lets me FaceTime her most days.\u201d Even parrots, like Billy from West Yorkshire, aren\u2019t missing out. \u201cEvery morning, he gets a decaffeinated tea and a better breakfast than me,\u201d says his owner, Lauren Atkinson. \u201cHe eats a mixture of seeds with unsalted nuts and he\u2019ll have some warm food like edamame beans, petits pois and sweetcorn mixed with almond milk twice a day. We call his extra-large cage \u2018the palace\u2019 \u2013 it has a play gym and java wooden stands and swings for him to relax on.\u201d Atkinson is keen to add that she is not a \u201ccrazy cockatoo lady\u201d \u2013 Billy has simply won her over. He has an Instagram account where he shares selfies and videos. \u201cHe\u2019s got more toys than a toddler and loves playing hide-and-seek, shouting \u2018Peekaboo\u2019 when he finds you,\u201d says Atkinson. \u201cHe\u2019s formed a unique bond with all my family \u2013 our mental health has improved, and it makes me want to pamper him even more. He\u2019s more than \u2018just\u2019 a pet.\u201d Lisa Morton, co-founder of the pet-drinks specialist Woof&amp;Brew, has noticed a huge increase in people seeking shared experiences with their pets. \u201cIt means many more cafes, restaurants and hotels are opening their doors and welcoming dogs, which is where our products fit perfectly,\u201d she says. \u201cWe launched six years ago with the world\u2019s first herbal doggy teabag.\u201d Since then, their Bottom Sniffer \u201cbeer\u201d for dogs (made from a non-fermented beer wort with seaweed extract, chicken flavouring, burdock, dandelion, flax, nettle and rooibos) and pawsecco \u201cwine\u201d (an infusion of elderflower, linden blossom, ginseng, water, natural caramel and citric acid) for cats and dogs have been bestsellers; Morton is expecting another big paws up for their latest herbal tonic, Champaws. She says the modern obsession with wellness has been key to the company\u2019s success. \u201cWe know consumers have been increasingly seeking natural products for themselves, and in turn want the same for their pets.\u201d Dogs such as Prudence and Mr Binks are her target customers. \u201cI never compromise on their diet,\u201d says Webb, who has had dogs for 18 years. \u201cThey eat the finest food designed for dogs \u2013 organic, ethically sourced meats \u2013 and Prudence has a special slow-feed bowl with ridges designed to make her meals last longer, and to make her eat more politely, while improving her digestion. I spend more on their food than on myself \u2013 because I know that will help keep them away from the vet.\u201d As well as paying premium prices for their meals, Webb treats the dogs to special balms that help minimise the effects of rough pavements on their feet, and books them in for regular holistic health and spa treatments. \u201cPrudence benefits from a regular oxygen facial available for dogs in Harley Street, London, as well as massages and red-light therapy, as she is boisterous and always pulling muscles. Mr Binks has regular acupuncture and red-light therapy for his hip, as he has a degenerative bone condition. It\u2019s wonderful to have so many wellbeing options for them \u2013 things are getting more sophisticated.\u201d The new crop of tech solutions include remote cameras that allow owners to stay in touch when away from home, food and treat dispensers with built-in cameras, and automatic ball launchers, so that people can feed and play fetch with their pets remotely. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer seen as acceptable to simply leave a bowl of water or give a dog a bone \u2013 technology is changing and enhancing the entire feeding, wellbeing and play experience,\u201d says Rob Steele, international marketing director for the animal-security company PetSafe. This year, the brand has seen strong growth in \u201cwaste management solutions\u201d \u2013 smart litter boxes that monitor toilet activity are up 25%, while car-seat boosters and steps that can be used to get up to a bed or sofa have never been so popular. He predicts the next big trends will be \u201cconnected\u201d products. As many of us track, log and quantify our own data (calories eaten, steps taken), it follows that we will do the same for our furry housemates. Much of this shift is being driven by younger pet owners. \u201cMillennials represent the largest segment of owners and are fuelling the humanisation trend,\u201d says Nicole Cooper, managing director of the National Pet Show. \u201cIt might be because they\u2019re drawn to the idea of ownership, and the emotional focus of looking after something.\u201d As more young couples delay having children, many consider pets to be their \u201cstarter\u201d babies. Nicole Garnett, 26, sees evidence of this in the course of her work; she runs Paws Of Perfection, a dog-grooming parlour in Berkshire. \u201cWe\u2019re so in tune with how we look after our own wellbeing, it\u2019s definitely rubbing off on our pets. I want my dogs, Alfie and Beano [a bichon frise and a westie cross shih-tzu], to live as long as possible, and will do what I can to maintain their health. They eat raw food and have FitBark activity monitors so I can track their steps and sleep. I take them to dog hydrotherapy pools to help their mobility. They get spoiled in other ways, too, such as camping and shopping trips \u2013 they love their Barbour jackets \u2013 and every year they get a cake and a new outfit for their birthday.\u201d Does she think the pampering can go too far? \u201cOh yeah. Five years ago, I\u2019d never expect dogs to turn up at the shop in a pram wearing a fancy dress outfit, or that I\u2019d be giving a blueberry facial scrub to a vegan dog. Some owners say there\u2019s never a moment where their dog is left on its own, and that leaving them with us is harder than leaving their child at nursery.\u201d Darcy, a cockapoo and \u201cdog blogger\u201d from west London, has travelled to more than 20 countries with her owner, May Wong. Recently, she had a wardrobe made to house her outfits and accessories. She also had a birthday party with her pooch pals at Cliveden House hotel in Buckinghamshire, where the Duchess of Sussex spent the night before the royal wedding. \u201cIt might sound over the top, but the indulgence comes from a deep emotional attachment,\u201d says Wong. \u201cI have no family and I know Darcy only cares about me.

This is Flannels, the achingly expensive designer emporium which Mike Ashley, the founder and chief executive of Sports Direct, views as the future of his retail empire. Ashley himself is round the corner in the pub, sipping a pint. But working the floor is Michael Murray, Ashley\u2019s future son-in-law, who the billionaire has made clear is in charge of turning his retail empire from pile-it-high joggers and hoodies to high-end brands and glitzy stores. Murray, Sports Direct\u2019s \u201chead of elevation\u201d who celebrated his 30th birthday on Friday, says he has hardly slept for two weeks after opening a flagship project in Leicester \u2013 which turned a former BHS shop into a Flannels, a USC store and a Sports Direct \u2013 and the London designer store. \u201cIt has been pretty hectic and doesn\u2019t look like slowing down any time soon,\u201d Murray says.

      "body": "<p>How do you start an interview with someone who has just lost everything?</p> <p>With the floodwaters just receded, the stench of mould beginning to creep into the hollowed-out buildings that survived two days of pummelling winds, and bloated corpses still being recovered, that was a question I was forced to grapple with last week in the Bahamas.</p> <p>There is no correct answer. The best I have come up with, in my time covering <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/14/florida-shooting-school-latest-news-stoneman-douglas\">mass shootings</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/05/we-pray-for-dawn-puerto-rico-still-devastated-despite-trumps-boasts-of-recovery\">natural disasters</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/apr/11/the-counted-police-killings-guardian-us-video\">police violence</a> in the US, is that you take a step back and allow the interviewee time, space and freedom to think about your questions \u2013 and you don\u2019t even start if they don\u2019t want to share.</p> <p>Last Friday, I was among a small group of journalists to visit the destroyed town of High Rock on the island of Grand Bahama. We were the first reporters to make it there after the eye of Hurricane Dorian, a monster category 5 storm that destroyed parts of this picture-perfect archipelago, ripped through the area.</p> <p>It was a scene of complete devastation with most houses reduced to their concrete foundations. In one remaining building, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/06/hurricane-dorian-bahamas-grand-bahama-abaco-latest-news\">I met Erica Roberts</a>, a 41-year-old who still bore cuts on her arms and face after having clung to a tree branch for hours to escape the storm surge. She had not heard from seven relatives, including two sons, whom she feared were dead.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fdfd9f9474d65ebdd7ac3d5eb5f44f16d7ece51c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fdfd9f9474d65ebdd7ac3d5eb5f44f16d7ece51c/0_484_5861_3516/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Women walking eastbound on their way to High Rock in the eastern side of Grand Bahama island.

Hurricane Dorian caused considerable damages to the island of Grand Bahama especially to the eastern side.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Angel Valentin/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But in this moment of unfolding crisis, she was incredibly clear: she wanted her story to be heard by as many people as possible.</p> <p>Which brings you to the next question. What do you ask?</p> <p>There is increasing scientific consensus that the climate crisis is making hurricanes stronger. Warming sea and air can contribute to a storm\u2019s intensity. Rising sea levels can make storm surge more deadly. The number of severe Atlantic hurricanes has roughly doubled in the past 20 years. Dorian was the fourth category 5 to make landfall in the past three years. It shares the record for the most intense storm in history.</p> <p>Before we arrived on Grand Bahama I had already asked my editors in New York to what extent we should be asking survivors of their views on the climate crisis. It\u2019s a delicate balance to strike, injecting an issue that can be perceived as deeply political into a personal tragedy.</p> <p>The decision was to ask tentatively and give people there the chance to share their views. Most outlets covering this story have not mentioned the climate in dispatches from the ground. Personally, I couldn\u2019t imagine <em>not</em> mentioning it.</p> <p>And numerous people I spoke to were keen to share their thoughts, most of them very aware of the science.</p> <p>\u201cI think the climate is playing a big role in all of this,\u201d Roberts told me. \u201cI\u2019ve recycled all my life. I use less plastic. And think about less emissions. I\u2019ve always been committed. But the world is not.\u201d</p> <p>Gaining access to remote areas hit by natural disasters, like those in the Bahamas, can be a tricky thing to navigate. When Dorian\u2019s path was less certain I was dispatched by the New York news desk to cover it from the United States.</p> <p>I flew into Savannah, Georgia, when it seemed almost certain the storm would hit the coastline in that region, but hurricanes can change course quickly and within 12 hours we realised that the Bahamas had been so badly hit we needed to get there. I drove about 500 miles to Miami and jumped on a flight to the Bahamian capital, Nassau.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1767e132b6fabf02ebd54e9c7d93e7740279cb76\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1767e132b6fabf02ebd54e9c7d93e7740279cb76/0_211_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Erica Roberts in her home in High Rock, Bahamas.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Erica Roberts in her home in High Rock, Bahamas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But even from here, accessing the islands in the north-western region of the Bahamas was almost impossible. Royal Marine helicopter rescue crews were swamped with evacuees. The airports in the region were either destroyed or flooded. Some news networks were paying in excess of $10,000 (\u00a38,000) just to fly over the region to see the scale of devastation.</p> <p>Eventually, an opportunity presented itself. Word got out that a Royal Caribbean cruise liner was destined for Grand Bahama to deliver aid, and would allow a small group of journalists to embed with them.</p> <p>It was a surreal experience, stepping from the luxury of a giant cruise ship into the devastation of a disaster zone with no running water or power. But the ship allowed us to get out to some of the most remote communities destroyed by Dorian. I filed my first story from the seat of a humid minivan, attempting, mostly in vain, to connect to the internet via hotspot.</p> <p>My colleague David Smith, who is currently on the Abaco Islands, another archipelago destroyed by Dorian, is embedded with British aid workers at a medical centre in Treasure Cay, using satellite internet to send his dispatches.</p> <p>Our coverage of Dorian required coordination with journalists around the globe. We worked with reporters and live bloggers in New York, London and Sydney, collaborated with a brilliant photojournalist, Angel Valentin, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/sep/06/hurricane-dorian-bahamas-high-rock\">throughout the trip</a>, and consulted with technical support staff who offered frequent assistance on communications issues.</p> <p>But the most challenging aspect of this reporting is the inability to communicate with the people you leave behind. Erica Roberts, like others I interviewed, had lost all her possessions, meaning she had no phone or internet access.</p> <p>We spoke for only 10 minutes as I hurried back to catch a boat. Although the government of the Bahamas has pledged to evacuate everyone on the islands most affected, should they choose to go, most people who survived have had their lives altered forever.</p> <p>The Guardian almost always <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/08/puerto-rico-hurricane-maria-electricity-ten-months\">returns to areas hit by natural disasters</a> to examine recovery efforts in the long term. I expect the Bahamas will be no different.</p> <p>In the meantime, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/08/hurricane-dorian-disaster-relief-how-you-can-help\">here\u2019s how you can help the </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/08/hurricane-dorian-disaster-relief-how-you-can-help\">relief efforts in the Bahamas</a>.</p>",

      "bodyText": "How do you start an interview with someone who has just lost everything? With the floodwaters just receded, the stench of mould beginning to creep into the hollowed-out buildings that survived two days of pummelling winds, and bloated corpses still being recovered, that was a question I was forced to grapple with last week in the Bahamas. There is no correct answer. The best I have come up with, in my time covering mass shootings, natural disasters, and police violence in the US, is that you take a step back and allow the interviewee time, space and freedom to think about your questions \u2013 and you don\u2019t even start if they don\u2019t want to share. Last Friday, I was among a small group of journalists to visit the destroyed town of High Rock on the island of Grand Bahama. We were the first reporters to make it there after the eye of Hurricane Dorian, a monster category 5 storm that destroyed parts of this picture-perfect archipelago, ripped through the area. It was a scene of complete devastation with most houses reduced to their concrete foundations. In one remaining building, I met Erica Roberts, a 41-year-old who still bore cuts on her arms and face after having clung to a tree branch for hours to escape the storm surge. She had not heard from seven relatives, including two sons, whom she feared were dead. But in this moment of unfolding crisis, she was incredibly clear: she wanted her story to be heard by as many people as possible. Which brings you to the next question. What do you ask? There is increasing scientific consensus that the climate crisis is making hurricanes stronger. Warming sea and air can contribute to a storm\u2019s intensity. Rising sea levels can make storm surge more deadly. The number of severe Atlantic hurricanes has roughly doubled in the past 20 years. Dorian was the fourth category 5 to make landfall in the past three years. It shares the record for the most intense storm in history. Before we arrived on Grand Bahama I had already asked my editors in New York to what extent we should be asking survivors of their views on the climate crisis. It\u2019s a delicate balance to strike, injecting an issue that can be perceived as deeply political into a personal tragedy. The decision was to ask tentatively and give people there the chance to share their views. Most outlets covering this story have not mentioned the climate in dispatches from the ground. Personally, I couldn\u2019t imagine not mentioning it. And numerous people I spoke to were keen to share their thoughts, most of them very aware of the science. \u201cI think the climate is playing a big role in all of this,\u201d Roberts told me. \u201cI\u2019ve recycled all my life. I use less plastic. And think about less emissions. I\u2019ve always been committed. But the world is not.\u201d Gaining access to remote areas hit by natural disasters, like those in the Bahamas, can be a tricky thing to navigate. When Dorian\u2019s path was less certain I was dispatched by the New York news desk to cover it from the United States. I flew into Savannah, Georgia, when it seemed almost certain the storm would hit the coastline in that region, but hurricanes can change course quickly and within 12 hours we realised that the Bahamas had been so badly hit we needed to get there. I drove about 500 miles to Miami and jumped on a flight to the Bahamian capital, Nassau. But even from here, accessing the islands in the north-western region of the Bahamas was almost impossible. Royal Marine helicopter rescue crews were swamped with evacuees. The airports in the region were either destroyed or flooded. Some news networks were paying in excess of $10,000 (\u00a38,000) just to fly over the region to see the scale of devastation. Eventually, an opportunity presented itself. Word got out that a Royal Caribbean cruise liner was destined for Grand Bahama to deliver aid, and would allow a small group of journalists to embed with them. It was a surreal experience, stepping from the luxury of a giant cruise ship into the devastation of a disaster zone with no running water or power. But the ship allowed us to get out to some of the most remote communities destroyed by Dorian. I filed my first story from the seat of a humid minivan, attempting, mostly in vain, to connect to the internet via hotspot. My colleague David Smith, who is currently on the Abaco Islands, another archipelago destroyed by Dorian, is embedded with British aid workers at a medical centre in Treasure Cay, using satellite internet to send his dispatches. Our coverage of Dorian required coordination with journalists around the globe. We worked with reporters and live bloggers in New York, London and Sydney, collaborated with a brilliant photojournalist, Angel Valentin, throughout the trip, and consulted with technical support staff who offered frequent assistance on communications issues. But the most challenging aspect of this reporting is the inability to communicate with the people you leave behind. Erica Roberts, like others I interviewed, had lost all her possessions, meaning she had no phone or internet access. We spoke for only 10 minutes as I hurried back to catch a boat. Although the government of the Bahamas has pledged to evacuate everyone on the islands most affected, should they choose to go, most people who survived have had their lives altered forever. The Guardian almost always returns to areas hit by natural disasters to examine recovery efforts in the long term. I expect the Bahamas will be no different. In the meantime, here\u2019s how you can help the relief efforts in the Bahamas.",

      "body": "<p><strong>Why are you publishing this book now?</strong><br>I still feel that the way that we talk about climate change is too compartmentalised, too siloed from the other crises we face. A really strong theme running through the book is the links between it and the crisis of rising white supremacy, the various forms of nationalism and the fact that so many people are being forced from their homelands, and the war that is waged on our attention spans. These are intersecting and interconnecting crises and so the solutions have to be as well.</p> \n<p><strong>The book collects essays from the last decade, have you changed your mind about anything?</strong><br>When I look back, I don\u2019t think I placed enough emphasis on the challenge climate change poses to the left. It\u2019s more obvious the way the climate crisis challenges a rightwing dominant worldview, and the cult of serious centrism that never wants to do anything big, that\u2019s always looking to split the difference. But this is also a challenge to a left worldview that is essentially only interested in redistributing the spoils of extractivism [the process of extracting natural resources from the earth] and not reckoning with the limits of endless consumption.</p> \n<p><strong>What\u2019s stopping the left doing this?</strong><br>In a North American context, it\u2019s the greatest taboo of all to actually admit that there are going to be limits. You see that in the way Fox News has gone after the Green New Deal \u2013 they are coming after your hamburgers! It cuts to the heart of the American dream \u2013 every generation gets more than the last, there is always a new frontier to expand to, the whole idea of settler colonial nations like ours. When somebody comes along and says, actually, there are limits, we\u2019ve got some tough decisions, we need to figure out how to manage what\u2019s left, we\u2019ve got to share equitably \u2013 it is a psychic attack. And so the response [on the left] has been to avoid, and say no, no, we\u2019re not coming to take away your stuff, there are going to be all kinds of benefits. And there <em>are</em> going to be benefits: we\u2019ll have more livable cities, we\u2019ll have less polluted air, we\u2019ll spend less time stuck in traffic, we can design happier, richer lives in so many ways.

That we\u2019re not talking about a little carbon tax or a cap and trade scheme as a silver bullet. We\u2019re talking about transforming our economy. This system is failing the majority of people anyway, which is why we\u2019re in this period of such profound political destabilisation \u2013 that is giving us the Trumps and the Brexits, and all of these strongman leaders \u2013 so why don\u2019t we figure out how to change everything from bottom to top, and do it in a way that addresses all of these other crises at the same time? There is every chance we will miss the mark, but every fraction of a degree warming that we are able to hold off is a victory and every policy that we are able to win that makes our societies more humane, the more we will weather the inevitable shocks and storms to come without slipping into barbarism. Because what really terrifies me is what we are seeing at our borders in Europe and North America and Australia \u2013 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s coincidental that the settler colonial states and the countries that are the engines of that colonialism are at the forefront of this. We are seeing the beginnings of the era of climate barbarism. We saw it in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/14/christchurch-attack-suspect-sent-call-to-arms-letter-from-cell\" title=\"\">Christchurch</a>, we saw it in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/04/el-paso-safe-city-white-man-killing-latinos\" title=\"\">El Paso</a>, where you have this marrying of white supremacist violence with vicious anti-immigrant racism.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ba461bae16ab3d36495eb2264d3ab19f4af8c97f\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ba461bae16ab3d36495eb2264d3ab19f4af8c97f/0_109_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A fire near Porto Velho, Brazil, September 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A fire near Porto Velho, Brazil, September 2019.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bruno Kelly/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>That </strong><strong>is one of the most chilling sections of your book: I think</strong> <strong>that\u2019s a link a lot of people haven\u2019t made.</strong><br>This pattern has been clear for a while. White supremacy emerged not just because people felt like thinking up ideas that were going to get a lot of people killed but because it was useful to protect barbaric but highly profitable actions. The age of scientific racism begins alongside the transatlantic slave trade, it is a rationale for that brutality. If we are going to respond to climate change by fortressing our borders, then of course the theories that would justify that, that create these hierarchies of humanity, will come surging back. There have been signs of that for years, but it is getting harder to deny because you have killers who are screaming it from the rooftops.</p> \n<p><strong>One criticism you hear about the environment movement is that it is dominated by white people</strong><strong>. </strong><strong>How do you address that?</strong><br>When you have a movement that is overwhelmingly representative of the most privileged sector of society then the approach is going to be much more fearful of change, because people who have a lot to lose tend to be more fearful of change, whereas people who have a lot to gain will tend to fight harder for it. That\u2019s the big benefit of having an approach to climate change that links it to those so called bread and butter issues: how are we going to get better paid jobs, affordable housing, a way for people to take care of their families? I have had many conversations with environmentalists over the years where they seem really to believe that by linking fighting climate change with fighting poverty, or fighting for racial justice, it\u2019s going to make the fight harder. We have to get out of this \u201cmy crisis is bigger than your crisis: first we save the planet and then we fight poverty and racism, and violence against women\u201d. That doesn\u2019t work. That alienates the people who would fight hardest for change. This debate has shifted a huge amount in the US because of the leadership of the climate justice movement and because it is congresswomen of colour who are championing the Green New Deal. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/29/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-met-greta-thunberg-hope-contagious-climate\" title=\"\">Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ilhan-omar\" title=\"\">Ilhan Omar</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2018/nov/07/ayanna-pressley-massachusetts-first-black-congresswoman\" title=\"\">Ayanna Pressley</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/may/14/rashida-tlaib-holocaust-israel-palestine-comments-democrats-defend-context-republican-attack\" title=\"\">Rashida Tlaib</a> come from communities that have gotten such a raw deal under the years of neoliberalism and longer, and are determined to represent, truly represent, the interests of those communities. They\u2019re not afraid of deep change because their communities desperately need it.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>The individual decisions that we make are not going to add up to anything like the kind of scale of change that we need</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p><strong>In the book, you write: \u201cThe hard truth is that the answer to the question \u2018What can I, as an individual, do to stop climate change?\u2019 is: nothing.\u201d Do you still believe that?</strong><br>In terms of the carbon, the individual decisions that we make are not going to add up to anything like the kind of scale of change that we need. And I do believe that the fact that for so many people it\u2019s so much more comfortable to talk about our own personal consumption, than to talk about systemic change, is a product of neoliberalism, that we have been trained to see ourselves as consumers first. To me that\u2019s the benefit of bringing up these historical analogies, like the New Deal or the Marshall Plan \u2013 it brings our minds back to a time when we were able to think of change on that scale. Because we\u2019ve been trained to think very small. It is incredibly significant that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/greta-thunberg\" title=\"\">Greta Thunberg</a> has turned her life into a living emergency.</p> \n<p><strong>Yes, she set sail </strong><strong>for the UN climate summit in New York on a zero carbon yacht ...</strong><br>Exactly. But this isn\u2019t about what Greta is doing as an individual. It\u2019s about what Greta is broadcasting in the choices that she makes as an activist, and I absolutely respect that. I think it\u2019s magnificent. She is using the power that she has to broadcast that this is an emergency, and trying to inspire politicians to treat it as an emergency. I don\u2019t think anybody is exempt from scrutinising their own decisions and behaviours but I think it is possible to overemphasise the individual choices. I have made a choice \u2013 and this has been true since I wrote <em>No Logo</em>, and I started getting these \u201cwhat should I buy, where should I shop, what are the ethical clothes?\u201d questions. My answer continues to be that I am not a lifestyle adviser, I am not anyone\u2019s shopping guru, and I make these decisions in my own life but I\u2019m under no illusion that these decisions are going to make the difference.</p> \n<p><strong>Some people are choosing to go on birth strikes. What do you think about that?</strong><br>I\u2019m happy these discussions are coming into the public domain as opposed to being furtive issues we\u2019re afraid to talk about. It\u2019s been very isolating for people. It certainly was for me. One of the reasons I waited as long as I did to try and get pregnant, and I would say this to my partner all the time \u2013 what, you want to have a Mad Max water warrior fighting with their friends for food and water? It wasn\u2019t until I was part of the climate justice movement and I could see a path forward that I could even imagine having a kid. But I would never tell anybody how to answer this most intimate of questions. As a feminist who knows the brutal history of forced sterilisation and the ways in which women\u2019s bodies become battle zones when policymakers decide that they are going to try and control population, I think that the idea that there are regulatory solutions when it comes to whether or not to have kids is catastrophically ahistorical. We need to be struggling with our climate grief together and our climate fears together, through whatever decision we decide to make, but the discussion we need to have is how do we build a world so that those kids can have thriving, zero-carbon lives?</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"fd681cbb2c24f3bad4ba3dcc918e796248fdf36a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd681cbb2c24f3bad4ba3dcc918e796248fdf36a/0_0_2879_3473/829.jpg\" alt=\"The Malizia II, with Greta Thunberg on board, arrives in Hudson Harbor, New York.\" width=\"829\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Malizia II, with Greta Thunberg on board, arrives in Hudson Harbor, New York.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bebeto Matthews/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Over the summer, you encouraged people to read Richard Powers\u2019s novel, </strong><em><strong>The Overstory</strong></em><strong>. Wh</strong><strong>y?</strong><br>It\u2019s been incredibly important to me and I\u2019m happy that so many people have written to me since. What <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/08/the-overstory-richard-powers-review\" title=\"\">Powers is writing about trees</a>: that trees live in communities and are in communication, and plan and react together, and we\u2019ve been completely wrong in the way we conceptualise them. It\u2019s the same conversation we\u2019re having about whether we are going to solve this as individuals or whether we are going to save the collective organism. It\u2019s also rare, in good fiction, to valorise activism, to treat it with real respect, failures and all, to acknowledge the heroism of the people who put their bodies on the line. I thought Powers did that in a really extraordinary way.</p> \n<p><strong>What are you views on what Extinction Rebellion has achieved?<br></strong>One thing they have done so well is break us out of this classic campaign model we have been in for a long time, where you tell someone something scary, you ask them to click on something to do something about it, you skip out the whole phase where we need to grieve together and feel together and process what it is that we just saw. Because what I hear a lot from people is, ok, maybe those people back in the 1930s or 40s could organise neighbourhood by neighbourhood or workplace by workplace but we can\u2019t. We believe we\u2019ve been so downgraded as a species that we are incapable of that. The only thing that is going to change that belief is getting face to face, in community, having experiences, off our screens, with one another on the streets and in nature, and winning some things and feeling that power.</p> \n<p><strong>You talk about stamina in the book. How do you keep going</strong><strong>? </strong><strong>Do you feel hopeful?</strong><br>I have complicated feelings about the hope question. Not a day goes by that I don\u2019t have a moment of sheer panic, raw terror, complete conviction that we are doomed, and then I do pull myself out of it. I\u2019m renewed by this new generation that is so determined, so forceful. I\u2019m inspired by the willingness to engage in electoral politics, because my generation, when we were in our 20s and 30s, there was so much suspicion around getting our hands dirty with electoral politics that we lost a lot of opportunities. What gives me the most hope right now is that we\u2019ve finally got the vision for what we want instead, or at least the first rough draft of it. This is the first time this has happened in my lifetime. And also, I did decide to have kids. I have a seven year old who is so completely obsessed and in love with the natural world. When I think about him, after we\u2019ve spent an entire summer talking about the role of salmon in feeding the forests where he was born in British Columbia, and how they are linked to the health of the trees and the soil and the bears and the orcas and this entire magnificent ecosystem, and I think about what it would be like to have to tell him that there are no more salmon, it kills me. So that motivates me.

This system is failing the majority of people anyway, which is why we\u2019re in this period of such profound political destabilisation \u2013 that is giving us the Trumps and the Brexits, and all of these strongman leaders \u2013 so why don\u2019t we figure out how to change everything from bottom to top, and do it in a way that addresses all of these other crises at the same time? There is every chance we will miss the mark, but every fraction of a degree warming that we are able to hold off is a victory and every policy that we are able to win that makes our societies more humane, the more we will weather the inevitable shocks and storms to come without slipping into barbarism. Because what really terrifies me is what we are seeing at our borders in Europe and North America and Australia \u2013 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s coincidental that the settler colonial states and the countries that are the engines of that colonialism are at the forefront of this. We are seeing the beginnings of the era of climate barbarism. We saw it in Christchurch, we saw it in El Paso, where you have this marrying of white supremacist violence with vicious anti-immigrant racism. That is one of the most chilling sections of your book: I think that\u2019s a link a lot of people haven\u2019t made. This pattern has been clear for a while. White supremacy emerged not just because people felt like thinking up ideas that were going to get a lot of people killed but because it was useful to protect barbaric but highly profitable actions. The age of scientific racism begins alongside the transatlantic slave trade, it is a rationale for that brutality. If we are going to respond to climate change by fortressing our borders, then of course the theories that would justify that, that create these hierarchies of humanity, will come surging back. There have been signs of that for years, but it is getting harder to deny because you have killers who are screaming it from the rooftops. One criticism you hear about the environment movement is that it is dominated by white people. How do you address that? When you have a movement that is overwhelmingly representative of the most privileged sector of society then the approach is going to be much more fearful of change, because people who have a lot to lose tend to be more fearful of change, whereas people who have a lot to gain will tend to fight harder for it. That\u2019s the big benefit of having an approach to climate change that links it to those so called bread and butter issues: how are we going to get better paid jobs, affordable housing, a way for people to take care of their families? I have had many conversations with environmentalists over the years where they seem really to believe that by linking fighting climate change with fighting poverty, or fighting for racial justice, it\u2019s going to make the fight harder. We have to get out of this \u201cmy crisis is bigger than your crisis: first we save the planet and then we fight poverty and racism, and violence against women\u201d. That doesn\u2019t work. That alienates the people who would fight hardest for change. This debate has shifted a huge amount in the US because of the leadership of the climate justice movement and because it is congresswomen of colour who are championing the Green New Deal. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley and Rashida Tlaib come from communities that have gotten such a raw deal under the years of neoliberalism and longer, and are determined to represent, truly represent, the interests of those communities. They\u2019re not afraid of deep change because their communities desperately need it. In the book, you write: \u201cThe hard truth is that the answer to the question \u2018What can I, as an individual, do to stop climate change?\u2019 is: nothing.\u201d Do you still believe that? In terms of the carbon, the individual decisions that we make are not going to add up to anything like the kind of scale of change that we need. And I do believe that the fact that for so many people it\u2019s so much more comfortable to talk about our own personal consumption, than to talk about systemic change, is a product of neoliberalism, that we have been trained to see ourselves as consumers first. To me that\u2019s the benefit of bringing up these historical analogies, like the New Deal or the Marshall Plan \u2013 it brings our minds back to a time when we were able to think of change on that scale. Because we\u2019ve been trained to think very small. It is incredibly significant that Greta Thunberg has turned her life into a living emergency. Yes, she set sail for the UN climate summit in New York on a zero carbon yacht ... Exactly. But this isn\u2019t about what Greta is doing as an individual. It\u2019s about what Greta is broadcasting in the choices that she makes as an activist, and I absolutely respect that. I think it\u2019s magnificent. She is using the power that she has to broadcast that this is an emergency, and trying to inspire politicians to treat it as an emergency. I don\u2019t think anybody is exempt from scrutinising their own decisions and behaviours but I think it is possible to overemphasise the individual choices. I have made a choice \u2013 and this has been true since I wrote No Logo, and I started getting these \u201cwhat should I buy, where should I shop, what are the ethical clothes?\u201d questions. My answer continues to be that I am not a lifestyle adviser, I am not anyone\u2019s shopping guru, and I make these decisions in my own life but I\u2019m under no illusion that these decisions are going to make the difference. Some people are choosing to go on birth strikes. What do you think about that? I\u2019m happy these discussions are coming into the public domain as opposed to being furtive issues we\u2019re afraid to talk about. It\u2019s been very isolating for people. It certainly was for me. One of the reasons I waited as long as I did to try and get pregnant, and I would say this to my partner all the time \u2013 what, you want to have a Mad Max water warrior fighting with their friends for food and water? It wasn\u2019t until I was part of the climate justice movement and I could see a path forward that I could even imagine having a kid. But I would never tell anybody how to answer this most intimate of questions. As a feminist who knows the brutal history of forced sterilisation and the ways in which women\u2019s bodies become battle zones when policymakers decide that they are going to try and control population, I think that the idea that there are regulatory solutions when it comes to whether or not to have kids is catastrophically ahistorical. We need to be struggling with our climate grief together and our climate fears together, through whatever decision we decide to make, but the discussion we need to have is how do we build a world so that those kids can have thriving, zero-carbon lives? Over the summer, you encouraged people to read Richard Powers\u2019s novel, The Overstory. Why? It\u2019s been incredibly important to me and I\u2019m happy that so many people have written to me since. What Powers is writing about trees: that trees live in communities and are in communication, and plan and react together, and we\u2019ve been completely wrong in the way we conceptualise them. It\u2019s the same conversation we\u2019re having about whether we are going to solve this as individuals or whether we are going to save the collective organism. It\u2019s also rare, in good fiction, to valorise activism, to treat it with real respect, failures and all, to acknowledge the heroism of the people who put their bodies on the line. I thought Powers did that in a really extraordinary way. What are you views on what Extinction Rebellion has achieved? One thing they have done so well is break us out of this classic campaign model we have been in for a long time, where you tell someone something scary, you ask them to click on something to do something about it, you skip out the whole phase where we need to grieve together and feel together and process what it is that we just saw. Because what I hear a lot from people is, ok, maybe those people back in the 1930s or 40s could organise neighbourhood by neighbourhood or workplace by workplace but we can\u2019t. We believe we\u2019ve been so downgraded as a species that we are incapable of that. The only thing that is going to change that belief is getting face to face, in community, having experiences, off our screens, with one another on the streets and in nature, and winning some things and feeling that power. You talk about stamina in the book. How do you keep going? Do you feel hopeful? I have complicated feelings about the hope question. Not a day goes by that I don\u2019t have a moment of sheer panic, raw terror, complete conviction that we are doomed, and then I do pull myself out of it. I\u2019m renewed by this new generation that is so determined, so forceful. I\u2019m inspired by the willingness to engage in electoral politics, because my generation, when we were in our 20s and 30s, there was so much suspicion around getting our hands dirty with electoral politics that we lost a lot of opportunities. What gives me the most hope right now is that we\u2019ve finally got the vision for what we want instead, or at least the first rough draft of it. This is the first time this has happened in my lifetime. And also, I did decide to have kids. I have a seven year old who is so completely obsessed and in love with the natural world. When I think about him, after we\u2019ve spent an entire summer talking about the role of salmon in feeding the forests where he was born in British Columbia, and how they are linked to the health of the trees and the soil and the bears and the orcas and this entire magnificent ecosystem, and I think about what it would be like to have to tell him that there are no more salmon, it kills me. So that motivates me. And slays me. \u2022 Naomi Klein will be in conversation with Katharine Viner at a Guardian Live event on 15 October.",

      "body": "<p>What follows is an imperfect list, a subjective selection of great quality beauty brands trying to do better for the good of the planet. They are not all doing <em>everything</em>; some are better than others and they could always be doing more. But as industry experts at a recent sustainability conference told me, again and again: we don\u2019t have time to wait for perfect, or for people to reject all the conveniences of modern life. It is more important to do something now than nothing at all, to our later cost. </p> <p>I take the view that big change comes from big business, which is why I\u2019ve included global megabrands where there is at least the will and potential for improvement. What constitutes improvement is another bone of contention, of course. Some believe 100% organic, non-GM products are the only way to go; others rightly point out that some crops can be grown organically only thousands of air miles away. Many of us look for recycled plastic (living only about three lives), others prefer infinitely recyclable (but much heavier to freight) glass. </p> <p>This lineup is more expensive than previous \u201cbest lists\u201d, which tend to run the gamut from mass market to high luxury. Locally made, renewable and sustainably grown ingredients cost more than petrol derivatives and virgin plastic, made in bulk in China. So I apologise if some of these prices make you wince, as they did me. </p> <p><em><strong>vg</strong> vegan, <strong>v</strong> vegetarian, <strong>cf </strong>cruelty free: all not sold in countries where animal testing is mandatory; <strong>vg</strong> contains no animal-derived ingredients. <strong>No brackets</strong>: not tested on animals in the EU, where it\u2019s illegal, but sold in countries where animal testing is mandatory.</em></p> <h2>1 Hydro Phil (vg)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"81ffbf87c8de06c738aadffa11e92c25904726ef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/81ffbf87c8de06c738aadffa11e92c25904726ef/0_38_709_635/500.jpg\" alt=\"Hydro Phil cotton swabs\" width=\"500\" height=\"448\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The UK uses more plastic cotton buds than any other European country\u2013 a staggering 13.2bn a year.

      "bodyText": "What follows is an imperfect list, a subjective selection of great quality beauty brands trying to do better for the good of the planet. They are not all doing everything; some are better than others and they could always be doing more. But as industry experts at a recent sustainability conference told me, again and again: we don\u2019t have time to wait for perfect, or for people to reject all the conveniences of modern life. It is more important to do something now than nothing at all, to our later cost. I take the view that big change comes from big business, which is why I\u2019ve included global megabrands where there is at least the will and potential for improvement. What constitutes improvement is another bone of contention, of course. Some believe 100% organic, non-GM products are the only way to go; others rightly point out that some crops can be grown organically only thousands of air miles away. Many of us look for recycled plastic (living only about three lives), others prefer infinitely recyclable (but much heavier to freight) glass. This lineup is more expensive than previous \u201cbest lists\u201d, which tend to run the gamut from mass market to high luxury. Locally made, renewable and sustainably grown ingredients cost more than petrol derivatives and virgin plastic, made in bulk in China. So I apologise if some of these prices make you wince, as they did me. vg vegan, v vegetarian, cf cruelty free: all not sold in countries where animal testing is mandatory; vg contains no animal-derived ingredients. No brackets: not tested on animals in the EU, where it\u2019s illegal, but sold in countries where animal testing is mandatory. 1 Hydro Phil (vg) The UK uses more plastic cotton buds than any other European country\u2013 a staggering 13.2bn a year. If only a bud will do, I use Hydro Phil\u2019s high-quality biodegradable bamboo and cotton swabs, in a recycled box. Also available: gift-worthy bamboo toothbrushes, cases and soapboxes. Try Cotton Swabs, \u00a32.50 for 100: for makeup clean-ups, eyeliner softening and against-doctor\u2019s-orders ear cleaning. Compost when done. 2 Spectrum brushes (vg) There are lots of affordable makeup brush companies with sustainable wood or bamboo handles, and non-animal hair, but this independent brand also cut its plastic packaging by 50% in 2018 and gives 1% of its gross revenue to plastic clean-up concerns. Try MB06 brush, \u00a35.99: if you buy only one eye brush, make it this sort of shape. A fluffy, tapered blender can be used to lay down lid colour, define the crease (rest tip in crease and oscillate like a windscreen wiper), or smudge hard lines. 3 Love, Beauty &amp; Planet (vg) Toiletries behemoth Unilever has made sustainability a focus, and its targets demonstrate serious intent: reducing its environmental impact, including every aspect of the supply chain (ingredients, manufacturing, packaging, transportation), by half. New brand Love, Beauty &amp; Planet has fun, fragrant, certified vegan body and haircare in 100% post-consumer recycled (PCR) plastic bottles. The young people in my life love them. Try Delicious Glow Body Butter, \u00a39.99 (250ml): a rich but unsticky cream containing plant and flower oils. 4 Dr Hauschka (cf) A pioneer in this field, the 50-year-old brand uses biodynamic farming methods to grow its ingredients, and green electricity wherever possible. Most of its high-quality, plant-based offering (the beautiful Cleansing Milk and iconic Rose Day Cream, for example) is packaged in glass and aluminium jars and tubes; what plastic remains has begun the transition to PCR, saving 65% of raw oil in the process. Side hustles include work with the World Hunger Project. Try Lemon Lemongrass Bath Essence, \u00a317 (100ml): zesty, skin softening and so luxurious that the late, great Nora Ephron referenced it in a carpe diem rallying cry following the premature death of a beloved girlfriend. \u201cAlways use the good bath oil,\u201d she said. And she was rarely wrong. 5 BYBI (vg) Instagram hit BYBI proves that it\u2019s possible to make a beautiful-looking, highly covetable product without shafting the environment. Founders Elsie and Domenika house their entire range in glass or bioplastic tubes derived from sugarcane (you\u2019d never know to touch them), sent in grass paper boxes, saving up to 4,800 tonnes of C02 emissions. The products are often made from food industry byproducts (the juice pulp in the serums, for example). Try Babe Balm Bronze, \u00a312 (6ml): gives a dewy, sexy glow to cheekbones, eyelids, lips and limbs. 6 The Soap Co (vg) This British social enterprise employs, trains and fairly pays an 85% visually impaired and blind workforce. Many of its partners \u2013 from designers and lawyers to PRs and spokespeople (of which I\u2019m one) \u2013 work pro bono. Ingredients are ethically sourced in the UK; soap bars are packaged in biofilm or recycled paper; and where plastic exists, refills are available minus the harder-to-recycle pump. Try Infinitely Recyclable Hand Wash, \u00a320 (300ml): a bumper aluminium pump bottle of geranium-scented goodness, available to pre-order. 7 Bramley (vg) \u00a3140 sounds insane for a handwash, but for that money Bramley will give you a 5l container, plus 250ml glass bottles to refill from the mother lode. The containers can be returned if your local council won\u2019t recycle them. If budget or storage or inclination prevents that, their \u201cplastic\u201d bottles (from \u00a34) are derived from renewable sugarcane. Try Bubble Bath, \u00a38 (100ml): if you like the kind of huge, fat foam that sticks to your chin in a Santa beard (this sits next to my own bath). 8 Weleda (cf) More than 75% of Weleda\u2019s plant ingredients come from biodynamic or organic farming, or controlled wild collection. Its commitment to biodiversity, and ethical treatment of workers, has been recognised by the Union for Ethical BioTrade \u2013 it is one of only two beauty brands to carry the UEBT mark and was the first to earn a Look For The Zero badge, showing none of its products contains any form of plastic. Try Skin Food (Classic and Light), \u00a37.95 (30ml): a rich, pleasingly gloopy moisturiser for face, hands and body (though I preferred the old aluminium brutalist packaging). 9 Neal\u2019s Yard (v) The first UK brand to be Look For The Zero certified, Neal\u2019s Yard successfully campaigned alongside Greenpeace against microbead use. This year it launched a recycling scheme inviting customers to bring in tricky-to-recycle packaging and items from any brand; its own packaging is mostly glass. Try Almond Moisturiser, \u00a322 (50ml): recommended to me by countless readers over the years, especially those with sensitive skin. Makes a terrific makeup base, too. 10 Soaper Duper (vg) This brand\u2019s tactile bubble bottles are made from 50% PCR plastic (down from 100%, as the company can\u2019t source enough recycled plastic; it is working on getting the levels back up) and its tubes 55%. It has so far recycled over 22 metric tonnes of plastic and donated \u00a3150,000 to WaterAid. Try Nourishing Coconut Body Wash, \u00a37.50 (400ml): my children like the juicy fruit varieties, my husband loves the creamy shea and vanilla. Fine, so long as they keep their mitts off this. 11 Axiology (vg) This brand\u2019s distinctive triangular boxes are made of recycled paper in a female-owned factory in Bali which transforms local waste into packaging. Inside, a recycled, recyclable aluminium tube holds a vegan, Peta-approved, palm oil-free lipstick. Try Lipstick, \u00a329: bold colour in luxury, pose-worthy packaging. 12 Lush (v) About 90% of Lush\u2019s packaging is recycled, including plastic and paper that\u2019s 100% PCR. It reckons half its products can be taken home without any packaging, and its Naked shop in Manchester is England\u2019s first plastic packaging-free cosmetics shop. Try New Shampoo Bar, \u00a38 (55g): a tingly, head-clearing, foaming bar, perfect if you like your scalp to feel squeaky clean and are a sucker for spicy (cinnamon and clove) smells. 13 REN (cf) Last year REN made a commitment to zero waste by 2021. Moving towards elimination of unnecessary packaging and partnering with organisations such as TerraCycle and Surfrider, it is stopping sample sachets and using recycled ocean plastic in packaging. Try Glycol Lactic Radiance Renewal Mask, \u00a336 (50ml): a fast, noticeable makeover, smoothing and polishing tired, dull skin in 10 minutes. 14 L\u2019Occitane This brand prides itself on never having given out plastic bags in-store and recycling since the 90s. Simply by reducing the thickness of packaging, it reckons it has already saved 28 tonnes of plastic; by 2025, it wants all its bottles to be of 100% recycled plastic and every store to offer recycling. Try Liquid Soap Refill Duo, \u00a329 (2 x 500ml): the shea butter hand soaps are among the very best, perfect for hardworking, dry hands. 15 Gosh (cf) CO2-neutral Danish company Gosh takes 40% of the plastic packaging for its Dextreme foundation from waste from oceans, beaches and rivers. It reckons buying one foundation equates to removing at least 10 plastic bags from the seas. Meanwhile, it is launching a bodycare product made from dairy industry byproduct whey. Try 3 in 1 Hybrid Eyes in Grey Brown, \u00a39.99: a creme eyeshadow in taupey, mushroomy brown is the fastest way for eyes to look more defined. 16 A Good Company (vg) The toothbrushes thrown away each year in the US alone could stretch round the planet four times, and the composite plastics used render them unrecyclable. This is a compelling alternative, using sustainable bamboo grown without chemicals or pesticides and compostable bristles. Try Bamboo Toothbrush, \u00a34: cool colours, kids and adult sizes, great price and free handle-monogramming make this a fantastic stocking filler. I keep a stash for forgetful guests. 17 The Body Shop (cf) Pioneering in this field long before many brands had composted their first apple core, in 1987 it launched Community Trade, a commitment to local suppliers and projects. It has since invested in recycled plastic and given 2,500 waste pickers in India access to better working conditions, improved education and health services, a fair price for their work and predictable income. Empty containers can be returned to stores, to be recycled or repurposed. Try Skin Defence Multi Protection Essence SPF50, \u00a317 (40ml): ungreasy, high-protection sunscreen that doesn\u2019t peel, aggravate sensitive or oily skins, or wander off at midday. 18 Biolage (cf) All its bottles are made partially of PCR plastic, the factory in Kentucky sends no waste to landfill and uses 100% renewable energy. Its Spanish facility is a \u201cdry factory\u201d, meaning any water consumed goes into products or is used by employees. Try RAW Scalp Care Antidandruff Shampoo, \u00a313.85 (325ml): lovely-smelling, vegan and really soothes and deflakes flared-up scalps. 19 Beauty Kitchen (v) This was the first beauty brand certified by B Corporation, which recognises social and environmental performance. With Return Refill Repeat, it washes and reuses its own and other brands\u2019 packaging, and 2% of sales go to charity partners such as Plastic Soup Foundation and the Seahorse Trust. Try Seahorse Plankton Plus High Definition Facial Oil, \u00a320 (30ml): a moisturising, skin-softening oil that behaves like something much pricier. 20 Medik 8 (vg) This cosmeceutical brand uses cold processes where possible, blending formulas at room temperature to avoid burning energy by heating ingredients. Microbead-free, it uses natural exfoliators such as jojoba beads and bamboo. It has replaced plastic inserts in cartons with recycled card; its serum bottles and pipettes are glass, 40% of it recycled. Try Intelligent Retinol, \u00a333 (15ml): clinically proven to improve skin texture and reduce wrinkles, Medik 8 retinols are among the best on offer. 21 Davines (cf) Last year, the Italian brand unveiled its spectacular new HQ, Davines Village, featuring a host of sustainable initiatives: 100% of its electricity is from renewable sources, it is single-use plastic-free, has electric vehicle charging points and repurposes its restaurant\u2019s organic waste. Last year the company also achieved carbon neutrality for packaging production. Try Davines Oil Non Oil, \u00a317 (250ml): the least greasy hair oil for separating curls, taming frizz and moisturising dry ends. Curly types swear it\u2019s magic. 22 Floral Street (vg) There are lots of luxury fragrance houses with a focus on sustainability (Clean Reserve, Sana Jardin, Laboratory) but none this accessible. Floral Street\u2019s good quality, wearable scents come in a lovely glass and pulp carton \u2013 the first fully recyclable and biodegradable packaging in perfumery, made with recycled water, renewable energy and no chlorine. Try London Poppy, from \u00a324 (10ml): bright, citrus, almost impossible to dislike (even for the perfume averse). 23 Aveda (cf) The first beauty company to use 100% PCR PET, now more than 85% of its containers are of 100% PCR materials. It has raised \u00a349m for environmental initiatives since 1999 and from 2021 all its products will be vegan (its haircare already is) and its new launches will be silicone-free. Working with the nonprofit organisation charity: water, Aveda provides access to clean water for people in India, Nepal, Madagascar and Ethiopia \u2013 from where the brand ethically sources ingredients. Try Damage Remedy Daily Hair Repair, \u00a325 (100ml): I use this leave-in balm in place of conditioner (which weighs down my fine hair) and the difference in appearance, condition, manageability, texture and ease of styling has been dramatic. 24 Tropic (vg) People who love this Australian skincare and makeup brand really, really love it. And with refill pouches, zero landfill output, biodegradable bubblewrap, plastic-free tape and certified carbon neutral company status (it is doubling its carbon offset this year, effectively becoming carbon negative), it\u2019s hard to argue. Try Fruit Peel resurfacing serum, \u00a342 (30ml): fruity smelling, glow-giving and makes good of tired skin. 25 Bleach London (vg) Cool girls\u2019 favourite Bleach\u2019s bottles will be 100% PCR by the end of this year; its cardboard and paper already are. Single-use plastics have been removed from bleach and colouring kits (the mixing bowl is a sustainable coconut shell), and product refilling stations set up in salons. The aim is to be carbon neutral by 2020. Impressive for what was, nine years ago, a single sink in an east London nail bar. Try Shampoos and conditioners, \u00a37.50 (250ml): for anyone wanting to tone or de-yellow bleached hair. 26 Bulldog (vg) In 2017, the hugely successful British male grooming brand introduced into its tubes plastic derived from ethically souced sugarcane. Manufacture of some products uses \u201csingle-vessel quenching\u201d, which limits the amount of water heated, and last year it introduced a bamboo-handle razor (in recycled packaging) and a 5l recycled cardboard pack of shower gel. Try Sensitive Shave Cream, \u00a33.50 (100ml): I wish all brands selling at these prices gave this much of a damn. Beautifully does what it says on the tube, whatever area you\u2019re shaving. 27 Ethique (vg) All its products are compostable, free of plastic, palm oil and non-sustainable paper stock. Face, hair and body products come in solid bar form, saving about 1l of water each versus bottled products. Ethique\u2019s carbon-neutral practices are projected to save 10m plastic bottles from manufacture and landfill by 2020. Try Trial Pack for skin and hair, \u00a311: switching to solid products requires a leap of faith, but these try-me boxes of shampoo, conditioner, cleanser and moisturiser (lasting up to 15 uses) take out the risk. 28 Herbivore (vg) It may be one of Instagram\u2019s most photographed brands \u2013 you\u2019ll have seen its cool, minimalist packaging on a shelfie or nine \u2013 but it\u2019s comforting to know that millennials are lusting after recyclable glass, not landfill-bound plastic. The products are made without petrol industry derivatives and byproducts. Try Lapis Balancing Facial Oil, \u00a322 (8ml): an oil for oilies should be a tough sell, but reviews from the acne-prone and congested are raves. 29 ZAO (cf) This brand\u2019s bronzers, brow powders, eyeshadows, eye primers, shine-up powders and blushers are all plastic free; some items, such as the mascara, use minimal plastic refills housed in biodegradable bamboo handles. Try Mineral Cooked Powder, \u00a323.50: a talc- and nanoparticle-free range of bronzers, for all skin tones, that buff nicely into cheeks, temples and clavicles for a sunny glow with zero patchiness or dullness. 30 Wet Brush (vg) According to research at Ohio State University, the average lifespan of a hairbrush is under a year, and most head straight to landfill. Many will have been made by Wet Brush, which is taking action to reduce the waste. Try Go Green Detangler, \u00a314.99: slides through wet hair \u2013 from baby fine to coarse and unruly \u2013 like a hot knife through butter. Biodegrades within five years of disposal \u2013 but if it gets dirty, clean it, don\u2019t throw it out. High luxury 31 Kj\u00e6r Weis (cf) For makeup artist Kirsten Kj\u00e6r Weis, recyclable or recycled packaging seemed to be delaying its retirement in landfill. She wanted a refillable model, housing her certified organic makeup in luxury polished metal palettes and containers. Refills are packed in minimalist recycled cardboard. So simple, so covetable. Try Cream Blush, \u00a341 (3.5g): there\u2019s a lot to love in this silicone- and mineral oil-free range, but this buttery blush, giving a whisper of healthy flush, is my ride-or-die favourite. 32 Tata Harper (v) Harper considers sustainability in every aspect of her natural product line, from raw materials (renewable, GMO-free and many grown on the Vermont farm where she lives), to production (most are handmade in small batches on the premises, all using environmentally friendly processes), to bottles (any plastic is made from corn-derived resin). All paper and card is recycled and printed with soy ink. This is farm-to-face beauty and comes with a big price tag. Try Purifying Cleanser, \u00a366 (125ml): I\u2019d have sworn this wasn\u2019t my bag, but two years on my love remains strong. A herbal, almost medicinal-smelling no-foam face wash for oily, spotty and problem skins, but it\u2019s gentle and non-drying on everyone. 33 La Bouche Rouge (vg) A lot of money for a little luxury, sure, but there\u2019s no denying this is a great idea. Pick a handstitched, refillable leather case (genuine or vegan) and a lipstick finish (satin, matte or balm), choose any colour from the existing lineup or from a vast Pantone library, give it a name and the whole thing arrives in a stunning recycled cardboard presentation box, complete with vegan lipstick refill, in the post. A big investment, but a lifelong purchase and heirloom. Try Lipstick Case, \u00a390 (refills \u00a332): the gift for the beauty nerd who has everything. Watch for collaborations with top makeup artists. 34 Le Labo (vg) This hip perfumery brand has always offered refills on its fragrances. Return empty bottles to counters to be cleaned and refilled, for 20% less than the original. Gift boxes and bags are made from recycled cardboard. Try Labdanum 18, \u00a3127 (50ml \u2013 buy samples for \u00a34): Santal 33 may be its most popular fragrance, but this is my favourite. Musky, with cinnamon, wood and vanilla; baby powdery but refreshing; warm but not claggy, a little masculine but not macho. Smells pretty great on everyone, in fact. 35 La Mer As one would expect from a brand using biofermented sea kelp, La Mer\u2019s charitable focus is on the sea. Its Blue Heart Oceans Fund has donated more than \u00a34m to conservation projects. Its bestselling Cr\u00e8me de La Mer \u2013 the original It cream \u2013 is packaged in glass. Try Hydrating Illuminator, \u00a360 (40ml): a gorgeous cream for plumping up skin and leaving an almost pearlescent glow. Perfect as a pre-foundation primer or worn alone. Big brands doing better 36 Giorgio Armani In 2010, the brand developed its Acqua for Life initiative, which supports Unicef\u2019s efforts to ensure children have safe, clean water and has invested nearly \u00a37m in projects worldwide, bringing water to more than 195,000 people. Try Luminous Silk Foundation, \u00a342 (30ml): this dewy finish, medium coverage liquid base for normal to dry skin is among the best of all time. If you\u2019re oilier, try its Maestro. 37 Simple Britain\u2019s bestselling skincare line, with 9m products sold a year, will by the end of this year become the first major mainstream skincare brand to switch all its bottles to 100% PCR. Try Water Boost Micellar Cleansing Water, \u00a36.99 (400ml): in my view, Simple makes the best micellar water on the market. It removes even heavy eye makeup quickly and efficiently, without leaving skin irritated or parched. It\u2019s also the bestselling and among the cheapest. 38 Clarins The brand is involved in the Plastic Odyssey challenge, which will see a boat, powered by plastic waste collected on its voyage, visit three continents to highlight plastic waste in the oceans, while educating communities about the potential to recycle plastics into fuel. Clarins\u2019 new Paris HQ is certified by two environmental agencies; on its roof, three hives house 160,000 bees. Try Blue Orchid Treatment Oil, \u00a334 (30ml): one of my favourite products, this is a treat for dehydrated skin, and packaged in glass. 39 L\u2019Or\u00e9al Professionnel I\u2019ve been waiting 10 years for L\u2019Or\u00e9al to produce a 100% natural, permanent colourant containing no PPD, PTD, ammonia or peroxide. The three herbal ingredients in vegan Botan\u0113a are responsibly and fairly sourced from India; the jar packaging is 50% PCR, then refilled from paper sachets, reducing waste by 74%. Try Botan\u0113a hair colour, prices vary according to salon: glossy, healthy, cruelty-free colour, in any natural shade from pale blond to dark brown. PPD allergics can almost rejoice: it blends, rather than covers, greys. Skin test remains essential. 40 Origins Its Return to Origins recycling scheme invites customers to take empty packaging from any brand to UK counters, to be washed, shredded and transformed into plastic pellets, which can be used in anything from new packaging to street signs. The scheme has processed more than 1.2 tonnes of empties since 2010. Try GinZing Energy-Boosting Tinted Moisturiser SPF40, \u00a332 (50ml): a brilliant day cream for adding colour, covering blemishes, protecting against UV and restoring perkiness. \u2022 If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication).",

Annually, that worked out at \u00a31,560 for men, which is equal to \u00a324,050 today, but only \u00a3847.60 for women, equal to \u00a313,068 today.</p> <p>The figures suggest that real pay for the average male has risen by about a third over the last 50 years, but for women it has doubled. These figures, though, need to be taken with a large pinch of salt: they are averages, not the median figure, and reflect gross earnings rather than take-home pay after tax.</p> <p>A look through the Guardian\u2019s classified job adverts on the day the 50p was launched gives a snapshot of what real jobs paid. The Open University, which had just been established, was hiring professors at \u00a33,780 a year (equal to \u00a362,532 today), lecturers on a range of \u00a31,240 to \u00a32,850 (\u00a320,153-\u00a347,147), and secretaries on \u00a3756-\u00a31,068 (\u00a312,506-\u00a317,668).</p> <p>The Open University is still hiring \u2013 and its adverts suggest that real pay for academics has barely edged ahead in 50 years. It currently has an advert for a professor of economics on a range of \u00a367,700-\u00a375,800, while it pays lecturers \u00a333,000 to \u00a349,000. But the secretary job pays lots more in today\u2019s money, with the OU advertising a role at \u00a323,000 to \u00a326,000.</p> <p>Rampant sexism was a staple for job adverts in 1969, even in the Guardian. On that day, we carried an advert for a personnel officer at a new Courtaulds textile factory in Skelmersdale. The ad specified it had to be a man because Courtaulds was expanding its all-male labour force from 400 men to 1,200 men.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"85e5c3b41e48c3694415ae088816f790f77d66e1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/85e5c3b41e48c3694415ae088816f790f77d66e1/0_2313_3407_2044/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ford Capri\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Ford Capri cost \u00a3890 in 1969 \u2013 the equivalent of \u00a314,723 today adjusted for inflation.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>House prices</strong></h2> <p>In real terms, house prices in 1969 were just a third of their level today. The average house sold for \u00a34,312 \u2013 equal to \u00a371,333 in today\u2019s money, which would not even buy you <a href=\"https://www.rightmove.co.uk/property-for-sale/property-70624981.html\" title=\"\">a garage in north-west London</a>.</p> <p>However, if you look at the monthly cost of buying a home rather than the purchase price, the difference is not so large. In October 1969 the <a href=\"https://www.bsa.org.uk/BSA/files/5c/5c180498-5e52-4a41-b022-5821c25f3cbd.pdf\" title=\"\">Building Societies Association recommended mortgage interest rate</a> was 8.5%, while today loans can be found for below 2%. Women in 1969 were also treated as second-class borrowers, with the widespread belief that a male signee (husband or father) was required as a guarantor.</p> <h2><strong>Food and clothes</strong></h2> <p>One reason house prices were lower was that we all had less free money to spend after buying food. Chicken was about three times the price we pay today, while bread, eggs, coffee and sugar were about double the prices in supermarkets today.</p> <p>But comparing like with like is made tough by the change in weights and measures since 1969, as Britain went metric in the 1970s.</p> <p>What we are eating has also changed. While beef brisket, luncheon meat, dried prunes and corned beef appear in the ONS data for 1969, it\u2019s not until 1996 that prices of avocado and grapes were collected. And instant coffee appears to have been a thoroughly modern new thing in 1969, having appeared in the ONS data for the first time a year earlier.</p> <p>Clothes have also dramatically fallen in price in real terms since 1969. We were unable to obtain like-for-like prices of goods from then, but the fashion page of the Guardian that day gives an indication. We featured a black-and-white wool coat at \u00a334 in Debenhams \u2013 equal to \u00a3562 today \u2013 and a men\u2019s sheepskin coat at 38 guineas, equal to \u00a3662 today. Of the 670 coats in Debenhams\u2019 online store today, the most expensive is \u00a3349.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"64535dc265d06f2a6057aaa3403b5f85bd47b199\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/64535dc265d06f2a6057aaa3403b5f85bd47b199/0_16_5434_3261/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Des O\u2019Connor\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Des O\u2019Connor was one of the stars that viewers in 1969 could watch on their new colour TV.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Farrell/Redferns</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Electrical and household goods</strong></h2> <p>The Guardian of 14 October 1969 carried a story in the business pages on a major breakthrough for Granada Rentals \u2013 it would offer a colour TV for a rent of just \u00a31 a week. That\u2019s equal to \u00a3865 a year in today\u2019s money, but all you got was one channel in colour (BBC2) while the other two channels, BBC1 and ITV, still broadcast in black and white.</p> <p>Renting, even at those prices, was the only option for most people because colour TV sets cost astronomical prices. Our story said that a 19-inch set cost 199 guineas \u2013 nearly \u00a34,000 in today\u2019s money \u2013 at Currys, and Dennis Curry was reporting that sales had been \u201crather restrained\u201d. The Granada Rentals deal was for an 11-inch TV set.</p> <p>Not that there was a lot to watch in colour. Broadcasting on BBC2 began at 7pm that evening, with rugby league coverage of Hull v Wigan the primetime offering.</p> <p>Only half of Britain\u2019s homes owned a refrigerator in 1969, dishwashers were almost unheard of, and microwaves were in only a tiny number of homes. And without the likes of Ikea, home furnishings cost far more in real terms then than they do today.</p> <h2><strong>Culture and going out</strong></h2> <p>If you fancy going to see Fiddler on the Roof, now on at London\u2019s Playhouse theatre, seat prices for a typical October matinee range from \u00a320 to \u00a3145. Back in 1969, an advert in the Guardian showed that Fiddler on the Roof was also playing, but at Her Majesty\u2019s theatre. And the prices? There was a special offer of Wednesday matinees at 5s to 25s \u2013 or 25p to \u00a31.25. Adjusting for inflation, that means seats were going for just \u00a34 to a top price of \u00a320. West End theatre appears to have quadrupled in price in real terms since the 1960s.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8e76657197eff73ac73169c6de326dc0281ccdc2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8e76657197eff73ac73169c6de326dc0281ccdc2/0_185_2048_1228/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A pint of Guinness\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A pint of Guinness cost just 9p in 1969.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Mcerlane/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Oxford, the Sadler\u2019s Wells opera was on tour, charging from 6/ to 22/6 (30p to \u00a31.12) to see Madam Butterfly at the Playhouse. That\u2019s equal to \u00a34.80 to \u00a318.50 today. Currently Macbeth is booking at the Playhouse, priced at \u00a310 to \u00a330, so real prices appear to have doubled.</p> <p>In the pubs, we found Guinness at 1/9d (9p), and mild and bitter at 10p. Adjusted for today, beer prices have doubled in real terms. Mateus Ros\u00e9 was the most popular wine in the world then: the Queen drank it, and Jimi Hendrix was photographed swigging it out of the bottle.

Given that 50 years ago the 50p coin had the buying power of \u00a38 today, it has been a pretty poor investment.</p> <p>The 50p coin to watch out for is the more recent 2009 issue that carries a picture of Kew Gardens on the reverse. Just 210,000 of the coins were minted to mark the 250th anniversary of the Royal Botanic Gardens, compared with 19.9m Peter Rabbit 50p coins last year.</p> <p>According to coin dealers, the Kew Gardens 50p coins can fetch \u00a370-\u00a380. But, beware, there are two types \u2013 the \u201ccirculated\u201d one is much rarer than the shinier \u201cuncirculated\u201d coins, which only pick up about \u00a310-\u00a320 on eBay.</p> <p>Keep an eye out for the 50p coins issued to celebrate the London Olympics in 2012.

The Open University, which had just been established, was hiring professors at \u00a33,780 a year (equal to \u00a362,532 today), lecturers on a range of \u00a31,240 to \u00a32,850 (\u00a320,153-\u00a347,147), and secretaries on \u00a3756-\u00a31,068 (\u00a312,506-\u00a317,668). The Open University is still hiring \u2013 and its adverts suggest that real pay for academics has barely edged ahead in 50 years. It currently has an advert for a professor of economics on a range of \u00a367,700-\u00a375,800, while it pays lecturers \u00a333,000 to \u00a349,000. But the secretary job pays lots more in today\u2019s money, with the OU advertising a role at \u00a323,000 to \u00a326,000. Rampant sexism was a staple for job adverts in 1969, even in the Guardian. On that day, we carried an advert for a personnel officer at a new Courtaulds textile factory in Skelmersdale. The ad specified it had to be a man because Courtaulds was expanding its all-male labour force from 400 men to 1,200 men. House prices In real terms, house prices in 1969 were just a third of their level today. The average house sold for \u00a34,312 \u2013 equal to \u00a371,333 in today\u2019s money, which would not even buy you a garage in north-west London. However, if you look at the monthly cost of buying a home rather than the purchase price, the difference is not so large. In October 1969 the Building Societies Association recommended mortgage interest rate was 8.5%, while today loans can be found for below 2%. Women in 1969 were also treated as second-class borrowers, with the widespread belief that a male signee (husband or father) was required as a guarantor. Food and clothes One reason house prices were lower was that we all had less free money to spend after buying food. Chicken was about three times the price we pay today, while bread, eggs, coffee and sugar were about double the prices in supermarkets today. But comparing like with like is made tough by the change in weights and measures since 1969, as Britain went metric in the 1970s. What we are eating has also changed. While beef brisket, luncheon meat, dried prunes and corned beef appear in the ONS data for 1969, it\u2019s not until 1996 that prices of avocado and grapes were collected. And instant coffee appears to have been a thoroughly modern new thing in 1969, having appeared in the ONS data for the first time a year earlier. Clothes have also dramatically fallen in price in real terms since 1969. We were unable to obtain like-for-like prices of goods from then, but the fashion page of the Guardian that day gives an indication. We featured a black-and-white wool coat at \u00a334 in Debenhams \u2013 equal to \u00a3562 today \u2013 and a men\u2019s sheepskin coat at 38 guineas, equal to \u00a3662 today. Of the 670 coats in Debenhams\u2019 online store today, the most expensive is \u00a3349. Electrical and household goods The Guardian of 14 October 1969 carried a story in the business pages on a major breakthrough for Granada Rentals \u2013 it would offer a colour TV for a rent of just \u00a31 a week. That\u2019s equal to \u00a3865 a year in today\u2019s money, but all you got was one channel in colour (BBC2) while the other two channels, BBC1 and ITV, still broadcast in black and white. Renting, even at those prices, was the only option for most people because colour TV sets cost astronomical prices. Our story said that a 19-inch set cost 199 guineas \u2013 nearly \u00a34,000 in today\u2019s money \u2013 at Currys, and Dennis Curry was reporting that sales had been \u201crather restrained\u201d. The Granada Rentals deal was for an 11-inch TV set. Not that there was a lot to watch in colour. Broadcasting on BBC2 began at 7pm that evening, with rugby league coverage of Hull v Wigan the primetime offering. Only half of Britain\u2019s homes owned a refrigerator in 1969, dishwashers were almost unheard of, and microwaves were in only a tiny number of homes. And without the likes of Ikea, home furnishings cost far more in real terms then than they do today. Culture and going out If you fancy going to see Fiddler on the Roof, now on at London\u2019s Playhouse theatre, seat prices for a typical October matinee range from \u00a320 to \u00a3145. Back in 1969, an advert in the Guardian showed that Fiddler on the Roof was also playing, but at Her Majesty\u2019s theatre. And the prices? There was a special offer of Wednesday matinees at 5s to 25s \u2013 or 25p to \u00a31.25. Adjusting for inflation, that means seats were going for just \u00a34 to a top price of \u00a320. West End theatre appears to have quadrupled in price in real terms since the 1960s. In Oxford, the Sadler\u2019s Wells opera was on tour, charging from 6/ to 22/6 (30p to \u00a31.12) to see Madam Butterfly at the Playhouse. That\u2019s equal to \u00a34.80 to \u00a318.50 today. Currently Macbeth is booking at the Playhouse, priced at \u00a310 to \u00a330, so real prices appear to have doubled. In the pubs, we found Guinness at 1/9d (9p), and mild and bitter at 10p. Adjusted for today, beer prices have doubled in real terms. Mateus Ros\u00e9 was the most popular wine in the world then: the Queen drank it, and Jimi Hendrix was photographed swigging it out of the bottle. How times change. How prices have changed Item Price in 1969 Price adjusted for inflation Actual price today Average wage (male, full time) \u00a31,560 \u00a324,050 \u00a331,834 Average wage (female, full time) \u00a3847 \u00a313,068 \u00a326,103 Average house price \u00a34,312 \u00a371,333 \u00a3215,910 New car (Mini Mk II) \u00a3595.10s.0d \u00a39,860 \u00a316,195 (Mini 3dr hatch) New car (Ford Capri) \u00a3890 \u00a314,723 \u00a322,160 (Ford Fiesta ST) Petrol (litre) 7.3p 120p 128p Fresh whole chicken 41p \u00a36.80 \u00a32.80 Loaf of white bread 8p \u00a31.32 59p Bag of sugar 8p \u00a31.32 69p Milk (one pint) 4.4p 73p 50p Eggs (dozen, large) 20.2p \u00a33.34 \u00a31.89 Instant coffee 21.8p \u00a33.60 \u00a31.89 Pint of bitter 10p \u00a31.65 \u00a33.70 Colour television (19 inch) \u00a3240 \u00a33,970 \u00a399 Package holiday (two weeks Benidorm, August, pp) \u00a378 \u00a31,290 \u00a3950 Flight (London to Tokyo, economy) \u00a3325 \u00a35,376 \u00a3900 First-class stamp 2.2p 36.5p 70p Tube fare (one mile) 2.2p 36.5p \u00a32.40 Electricity (per kwh) 0.78p 12.9p 14.4p Notes: House price data from Nationwide building society.

There is one 50p coin possibly jangling in your pocket today that is worth a lot more than its face value. But it\u2019s not the first version of the coin minted in 1969. The Royal Mint puts 120m new 50p coins into circulation on 14 October 1969, which at the time was the biggest ever issue of a new coin \u2013 giving it almost zero rarity value. On eBay, 1969 50p coins can be bought for as little as 75p. Given that 50 years ago the 50p coin had the buying power of \u00a38 today, it has been a pretty poor investment. The 50p coin to watch out for is the more recent 2009 issue that carries a picture of Kew Gardens on the reverse. Just 210,000 of the coins were minted to mark the 250th anniversary of the Royal Botanic Gardens, compared with 19.9m Peter Rabbit 50p coins last year. According to coin dealers, the Kew Gardens 50p coins can fetch \u00a370-\u00a380. But, beware, there are two types \u2013 the \u201ccirculated\u201d one is much rarer than the shinier \u201cuncirculated\u201d coins, which only pick up about \u00a310-\u00a320 on eBay. Keep an eye out for the 50p coins issued to celebrate the London Olympics in 2012. Dominic Chorney at coin dealers Baldwin\u2019s says some are worth \u00a33-\u00a34, depending on the sport featured. Chorney adds that despite the move towards a cashless society \u2013 the Royal Mint did not produce any 1p or 2p coins last year, neither did it make any new \u00a32 coins \u2013 coin collecting remains popular, with record prices at auction for the rarest items. In January this year, a five guinea \u201cVigo\u201d\u2019 coin minted in 1703 fetched the highest price ever paid for a British coin. It sold at Baldwin\u2019s auction in New York for $1.08m (\u00a3876,000).",

This week Marie Claire announced the closure of its UK print edition, adding to an expanding list of high-profile titles from NME to FHM that have succumbed to the digital revolution.

Marie Claire, for instance, will continue online and its owner says the title is simply following the readers. \u201cIt is very similar to the route we took with NME,\u201d says Marcus Rich, the chief executive of Marie Claire\u2019s UK publisher, TI Media. \u201cThere are just certain reader demographics that have moved to smartphones, or the web, and it makes sense to move digital-first. It was a logical evolution as a lot of focus was spent on trying to sustain a print model; now we can focus online.\u201d The biggest challenge with chasing readers online is fighting the stranglehold the Silicon Valley giants have on eyeballs \u2013 and the advertising pounds that follow them. By 2021, Google (including YouTube), Facebook (including Instagram), Twitter and Snapchat will rake in almost \u00a312bn in digital ad revenues in the UK, equal to 70% of the total digital market, according to research by eMarketer. By comparison, digital ad spend on consumer magazine brands will be just \u00a3130m this year. As print advertising in consumer magazines dries up \u2013 by the end of this year it will have more than halved from \u00a3512m in 2010 to \u00a3220m \u2013 publishers are branching out into areas such as e-commerce and events. The stockmarket-listed publisher Future, which has a portfolio of 100 publishing brands from the gadget magazine T3 to the rock title Metal Hammer, has bucked the malaise and seen its market value hit a record high of \u00a31bn. However, the chief executive, Zillah Byng-Thorne, says just one-third of its more than \u00a3200m in annual revenue now comes from traditional print advertising or magazine sales. The company now makes tens of millions of pounds from the commission it earns from sales of products to readers who make a purchase from a partner \u2013 such as Amazon or John Lewis \u2013 after reading a product review on one of its sites. At the tough end of the consumer magazine market, dual online and print strategies are also starting to show real promise. Earlier this year the Face, the style magazine that defined the 80s and 90s, made a comeback after 15 years with a web strategy backed by a quarterly magazine. And two years after the UK\u2019s then 10th bestselling magazine, Glamour, cut its print run to just twice a year and went digital-first, it is now on track to be back in profit for 2019. But for many other titles, as Marie Claire has just shown, the ability to stay in print in any form is an ongoing struggle.",

So in a way, it\u2019s the four of us.\u201d Harrison died of lung cancer in 2001. McCartney and Starr have worked together on a number of records since the Beatles split up in 1970, including Starr\u2019s last album, Give More Love. The track, recorded in Starr\u2019s home studio, features on What\u2019s My Name, his 20th solo album, which also features a number of regular contributors and members of his touring All-Starr Band. It will be released in October. This week, the Guardian was given access to a rare recording of the band\u2019s discussions while they recorded Abbey Road. \u201cIt\u2019s a revelation,\u201d the historian Mark Lewisohn said of the find. \u201cThe books have always told us that they knew Abbey Road was their last album and they wanted to go out on an artistic high. But no \u2013 they\u2019re discussing the next album. And you think that John is the one who wanted to break them up but, when you hear this, he isn\u2019t. Doesn\u2019t that rewrite pretty much everything we thought we knew?\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The #MeToo movement can reasonably be described as kicking off on 5 October 2017, with a New York Times report Harvey Weinstein Paid Off Sexual Harassment Accusers for Decades that contained the accounts of eight women who said they were sexually harassed or assaulted by the now-disgraced Hollywood producer.</p> <p> Weinstein is now facing a trial for his alleged crimes. But what followed the Times\u2019 story was a deluge of accusations of sexual misconduct toward women by men \u2013 often with a straight-forward power dynamic between older, professionally accomplished men and younger, often vulnerable, women trying to establish a career. Many of the biggest names in media, the arts and politics were brought down.</p> <p>Now, after the revelations and the downfalls, what is following is a flood of books on the #MeToo movement and how it has begun to reshape gender relations.</p> <p>New York Times reporters Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey have chronicled their Weinstein expos\u00e9 in She Said, a powerful review published last week of what it took to break the Weinstein story.</p> <p>It joins other books that have already attempted to describe both the roots of the #MeToo movement, including Linda Hirshman\u2019s excellent Reckoning: The Epic Battle Against Sexual Abuse and Harassment, and the latent anger that informs it, including<strong> </strong>Rebecca Traister\u2019s exploration of the transformative power of female anger, Good and Mad. And there are more books coming on other famous #MeToo cases such as the downfall of TV executive Les Moonves, New Yorker writer Ronan Farrow\u2019s account of his own multiple #MeToo investigations, including on Weinstein, and books on abuse scandals in sports and politics.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s unprecedented because the #MeToo movement is unprecedented,\u201d said Henry Holt editor Libby Burton. \u201cIf the publishing industry works as it should, it can capture a cultural moment in a way that solidifies it, adds legitimacy, and hopefully create social and societal change.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/10/she-said-book-harvey-weinstein-twohey-kantor\">She Said: an inside look at the story that brought down Harvey Weinstein</a> </p> </aside>  <p>She Said examines what happens when a bully is cornered and his defenses \u2013 non-disclosure agreements and other more basic, brutal methods of ensuring silence \u2013 are stripped away. Actors Rose McGowan and Gwyneth Paltrow appear as heroes of the hour; the women\u2019s right lawyer Lisa Bloom, the villain for her part \u2013 since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/25/lisa-bloom-sexual-abuse-jeffrey-epstein-metoo\">regretted</a> \u2013 in attempting throw off the journalists\u2019 investigation and thwart his accusers.</p> <p>Other books, too, have powerful narratives and colorful casts of characters as the #MeToo phenomenon becomes it own mini-publishing pantheon.</p> <p>In October, Farrow, winner of a Pulitzer Prize for his reporting on Weinstein in the New Yorker, is set to publish Catch and Kill, described by his publisher as \u201ca true account of the extreme tactics powerful men use to cover up crimes and abuse\u201d.</p> <p>His reporting closely followed the Times\u2019, adding the accounts of 13 women who alleged sexual harassment, assault or rape against Weinstein. Farrow\u2019s new book promises to expose corruption \u201cfrom Hollywood to Washington and beyond\u201d and the ways in which \u201csurveillance and intimidation [were] deployed by wealthy and connected men to threaten journalists, evade accountability, and silence victims of abuse.\u201d</p> <p>Also in the Weinstein file is Ken Auletta\u2019s coming account of attempting to confront the movie producer as far back as 2002. \u201cHis bullying with women, or sexual predations, was a natural outgrowth \u2014 that\u2019s the way he treated everyone, male or female,\u201d Auletta recently told Peter Kafka\u2019s Recode Media.</p> <p>Ultimately, Auletta was unable to unpick the knots of nondisclosure agreements Weinstein used to silence his alleged victims.

      "bodyText": "The #MeToo movement can reasonably be described as kicking off on 5 October 2017, with a New York Times report Harvey Weinstein Paid Off Sexual Harassment Accusers for Decades that contained the accounts of eight women who said they were sexually harassed or assaulted by the now-disgraced Hollywood producer. Weinstein is now facing a trial for his alleged crimes. But what followed the Times\u2019 story was a deluge of accusations of sexual misconduct toward women by men \u2013 often with a straight-forward power dynamic between older, professionally accomplished men and younger, often vulnerable, women trying to establish a career. Many of the biggest names in media, the arts and politics were brought down. Now, after the revelations and the downfalls, what is following is a flood of books on the #MeToo movement and how it has begun to reshape gender relations. New York Times reporters Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey have chronicled their Weinstein expos\u00e9 in She Said, a powerful review published last week of what it took to break the Weinstein story. It joins other books that have already attempted to describe both the roots of the #MeToo movement, including Linda Hirshman\u2019s excellent Reckoning: The Epic Battle Against Sexual Abuse and Harassment, and the latent anger that informs it, including Rebecca Traister\u2019s exploration of the transformative power of female anger, Good and Mad. And there are more books coming on other famous #MeToo cases such as the downfall of TV executive Les Moonves, New Yorker writer Ronan Farrow\u2019s account of his own multiple #MeToo investigations, including on Weinstein, and books on abuse scandals in sports and politics. \u201cIt\u2019s unprecedented because the #MeToo movement is unprecedented,\u201d said Henry Holt editor Libby Burton. \u201cIf the publishing industry works as it should, it can capture a cultural moment in a way that solidifies it, adds legitimacy, and hopefully create social and societal change.\u201d She Said examines what happens when a bully is cornered and his defenses \u2013 non-disclosure agreements and other more basic, brutal methods of ensuring silence \u2013 are stripped away. Actors Rose McGowan and Gwyneth Paltrow appear as heroes of the hour; the women\u2019s right lawyer Lisa Bloom, the villain for her part \u2013 since regretted \u2013 in attempting throw off the journalists\u2019 investigation and thwart his accusers. Other books, too, have powerful narratives and colorful casts of characters as the #MeToo phenomenon becomes it own mini-publishing pantheon. In October, Farrow, winner of a Pulitzer Prize for his reporting on Weinstein in the New Yorker, is set to publish Catch and Kill, described by his publisher as \u201ca true account of the extreme tactics powerful men use to cover up crimes and abuse\u201d. His reporting closely followed the Times\u2019, adding the accounts of 13 women who alleged sexual harassment, assault or rape against Weinstein. Farrow\u2019s new book promises to expose corruption \u201cfrom Hollywood to Washington and beyond\u201d and the ways in which \u201csurveillance and intimidation [were] deployed by wealthy and connected men to threaten journalists, evade accountability, and silence victims of abuse.\u201d Also in the Weinstein file is Ken Auletta\u2019s coming account of attempting to confront the movie producer as far back as 2002. \u201cHis bullying with women, or sexual predations, was a natural outgrowth \u2014 that\u2019s the way he treated everyone, male or female,\u201d Auletta recently told Peter Kafka\u2019s Recode Media. Ultimately, Auletta was unable to unpick the knots of nondisclosure agreements Weinstein used to silence his alleged victims. Auletta says when he confronted Weinstein, the movie producer started to cry and told the writer he\u2019d ruin his marriage. The MeToo accounts don\u2019t stop at Hollywood or entertainment. Abigail Pesta\u2019s retelling of the serial sexual abuse of young gymnasts by Larry Nassar tackles the shocking story of the now-jailed USA Gymnastics national team doctor and osteopathic physician at Michigan State University. New York Times reporters Rachel Abrams and James Stewart delve into allegations of sexual harassment and assault by former CBS chief executive Moonves. The Education of Brett Kavanaugh, by the Times reporters Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly, looks into accusations of sexual assault against supreme court justice Kavanaugh by Christine Blasey Ford. And there\u2019s Tanya Selvaratnam\u2019s account Assume Nothing, which tells her story of falling into an abusive relationship with former New York State attorney general Eric Schneiderman, forced to step down while overseeing efforts to prosecute Weinstein. Julie Brown, whose series of investigative stories in the Miami Herald helped reignite the scandal around sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, also has a book coming. Publisher HarperCollins says the book \u201cwill expose the inner workings of the sexual pyramid scheme Jeffrey Epstein forced the girls into, and will implicate powerful, wealthy and influential politicians, academics, businessmen and public figures\u201d. As the #MeToo movement progresses, it\u2019s possible there won\u2019t be another story as enveloping, or one that reaches as far into wealth and power as Epstein\u2019s, whose upscale social circles include many rich and famous and powerful men. But i f there are any cautions here, it\u2019s that these stories tend to reflect a very narrow cast of society, says Henry Holt\u2019s Burton. Left behind in many of these accounts are the day-to-day stories that women face everywhere in their workplaces, homes and social settings. \u201cThese stories are about women in more powerful positions, actresses or people in the media, without recognizing how this has affected so many populations, including women of color or women with less economic clout. It\u2019s not just in Hollywood or New York media, but it\u2019s across the country and across the world,\u201d Burton said.",

      "bodyText": "Holidaymakers queuing at immigration at the Bahamas\u2019 Nassau airport are still serenaded by three pink-shirted men playing jovial music. They are still sunbathing on the beaches and still swimming in the sea. It is as if nothing has changed in paradise. Yet 40 minutes away by plane, on the Abaco Islands, heaven turns to hell. The Mudd, a shantytown that was home to the Bahamas\u2019 biggest Haitian immigrant community, has been obliterated by Hurricane Dorian as if by a massive bomb. On Thursday a bare, crooked tree reminiscent of a desert wasteland was one of the few things still standing. Every dwelling had been destroyed. Cars were overturned. The ground was a wasteland strewn with blankets, clothes, fridges, shoes, rusty nails, splintered plywood, toilets and toothbrushes. The size of several football pitches, the Mudd was peopleless; no one knows how many died here and how many evacuated. Natural disasters often expose the gap between the haves and have nots and Dorian was no different. While the Bahamas has a reputation as one of the most desirable tourist destinations on earth, its luxury hotels and homes depend on a life support system of fishermen, hotel workers and laborers. Once again, it is the poorest who have been hardest hit when catastrophe strikes. \u201cWe\u2019ve brought this on ourselves,\u201d was one opinion conveyed anonymously to the Guardian. \u201cIt\u2019s all fine when you\u2019re living in paradise and a Haitian comes and mows your lawn. We\u2019ve just created our own structure and there hasn\u2019t been any attempt to integrate.\u201d Haitians have lived in the Bahamas for centuries but face poverty and prejudice, for reasons including religious beliefs that can include voodoo. A 2008 article in the College of the Bahamas Research Journal, entitled the Stigma of Being \u2018Haitian\u2019 in the Bahamas, noted that \u201cBahamians have long \u2018looked down\u2019 on Haitians as not being social equals\u201d. The Mudd was built by thousands of Haitian immigrants over decades in Marsh Harbour on Abaco. But it was wiped out in hours, its flimsy wooden structures standing little chance against the wrath of Dorian. American emergency workers have found five bodies in the debris and expect more to come. Others fled and are unaccounted for. Some have evacuated by boat to Nassau. Some sought refuge in places such as the pink-walled New Haitian Mission Baptist church. At one point 210 Haitians gathered on its bare concrete floor, without electricity or running water. Now there are 45, including two children. Charles Ilfrenord, its pastor, who moved from Haiti 35 years ago but still has family there, said: \u201cPlenty of people died in the Mudd. I think more than 1,000.\u201d Jean Claude Timothy, 41, a builder and electrician who lived next to the Mudd, recalled helping his wife and children into the attic of their house as water rose 25ft high. \u201cA trailer knocked the roof right off. I had to swim to get a boat to put my family in. We pulled it slowly down the road for a half a mile.\u201d The family were temporarily blinded by fumes from a nearby oil and diesel plant, Timothy added, but they found shelter in a government building. Timothy\u2019s wife, 31-year-old Kenya, and their four children were evacuated by a boat that was taking women and children only. Timothy is now sleeping rough in a roofless building and struggling for food. \u201cWe\u2019re just waiting for jobs and for something to do,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody\u2019s been hit, the rich and the poor, but for the rich it\u2019s less severe because they live in better buildings. The people you work for for years don\u2019t send a private plane for you. You worked for them for years but they don\u2019t give you any food, any vacation pay.\u201d Tourism employs about half the Bahamian workforce and accounts for around half GDP. Abaco is renowned for its marinas, golf courses and all-inclusive resorts. Even now, a leaflet at Nassau airport advertises the Abaco Beach Resort, including \u201ca boating paradise unlike any other\u201d. Glen Kelly, its harbour master, told the Washington Post: \u201cI\u2019ll put it as raw as I can. We\u2019ve always depended on Haitian labour, legal or illegal, to maintain this place. Now it\u2019s a question of whether they\u2019ll be back.\u201d Paradise comes at a social, economic and moral cost. The Bahamas has the second highest economic and social inequality in the Caribbean, according to the Latin American Economic Outlook 2019 Report. An editorial in the Nassau Guardian newspaper in 2017 warned: \u201cEconomic inequality is killing the Bahamas.\u201d As Hurricane Dorian approached, affluent people were able to get out early whereas the poor had to remain and try to ride it out. Lydia Ruth Hill, 38, a vacation planner and property manager, was one of only seven people who stayed behind in a neighborhood of more than 200. She had no sleep for 48 hours as she searched for missing people in the rubble; two of her relatives are still unaccounted for. She is now setting up a recovery command center but is inundated with messages from those who left and are worried about their possessions. \u201cThe night before last I answered 400 and some emails of people requesting me to send them stuff \u2013 \u2018get the guns out of my safe, get my Rolex watch\u2019 \u2013 or empty their fridges, when mine\u2019s got rotten stuff in it right now, or care for their pet when mine are dead because I lost my house and everything, and less than 20% supporting us to say what can we try to help you with? \u201cThey were just really inconsiderate requests when we were on survival mode here and then people mouthing off at us when we said that we don\u2019t have time to do that. At that point I was still trying to get critical care people off the island.\u201d Nearly two weeks after Dorian made landfall, at least 50 deaths have been reported, more than 1,300 people are missing and an estimated 15,000 are without food or shelter. Many in the underclass lost everything. Earl Arthurs, the operations specialist for the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency, said: \u201cAny disaster, the poor people will be the ones that are punished. A poor person owns a small house and it\u2019s not insured so when the hurricane comes and it\u2019s washed away, that\u2019s it. A rich person owns a nice mansion and it gets totaled but he gets money to build a new one. So that\u2019s a big difference. \u201cSome of these people are living from hand to mouth, weekly pay cheque, so when something like this happens and they cannot work, they will definitely be dependent on government for support.\u201d There are concerns that undocumented Haitian immigrants may be reluctant to seek government aid lest they be penalized and deported. Arthurs said: \u201cIn every country, including the United States, people are scared to come out and register during crisis time, because after the crisis is finished they fear that they probably have enough information on them to go and pick them up and deport them.\u201d Paul Taylor, a British aid worker whose NGO works with partners to coordinate and distribute aid, added: \u201cAs ever, there are people who do the work that the rich people don\u2019t want to do and here that\u2019s the Haitian community. There are lot of illegals here as well. \u201cI think the issue now is what happens to people who don\u2019t have any status here, who might be quite concerned about that. You\u2019ve got to evacuate people from the islands \u2013 big reconstruction job \u2013 but where do those people go?\u201d The government of the Bahamas denies that Haitians will be treated differently. Jack Thompson, a National Emergency Management Agency representative, said: \u201cPeople are people. All peoples need help, whatever their status. The prime minister was very clear in his remarks that we\u2019re going to help all persons here, irrespective of their nationality or status. There\u2019s no room for differentiating when you\u2019re in disaster.\u201d",

I always find this a bizarre argument \u2013 one that takes something that your parents used to say to you when you were eight and wouldn\u2019t finish your meal, and uses it to ignore the festival\u2019s cultural history, as well as the huge number of things that are part of our everyday lives and far more abhorrent when it comes to the question of waste.</p> <p>But my issue, in the end, is not with the argument, but with the level of certainty with which the person expressed it. Social media has exacerbated a trend whereby people speak with complete authority on every subject, regardless of how informed they are.</p> <p>I recently filmed a travel show in Mongolia, where we got an eagle to hunt a radio-controlled car with a stuffed fox on it, for creative reasons that I don\u2019t want to get into now. But that scene turned out to be the Pied Piper of trolls, and quite a few came out of the woodwork. There were a lot of people complaining about me enforcing my vegan views on people, but that\u2019s fine \u2013 I respect their right to do so. What got me was one person telling me that the eagle had probably broken its claw and so would have to be released into the wild, as a result of my cruel \u201cprank\u201d.</p> <p>The level of inside knowledge this person claimed to have, about something that five people were present to observe, was breathtaking. From their invented starting point, they extrapolated an angry argument, suggesting that it would have been more humane to use a real fox that would have died. But the eagle did not break its claw. I know this because <em>I was there</em>. </p> <p>On the same show, I went to Colombia and toured the country with the radio host Heisel Mora. While the show was broadcast, a woman tweeted me at various points to inform me that Heisel had not found what I was saying funny, and that she was offended, and that this was why we could never be friends. She knew far more about the week I had spent with Heisel than I did, on the basis of an edited one-hour show.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/aug/24/romesh-ranganathan-ive-shaved-off-my-beard-i-feel-like-an-imposter\">I\u2019ve shaved off my beard.

We are entering an age where people can claim to know more about what really happened than the people who were there.

      "bodyText": "I have just returned from filming A League Of Their Own in Spain, where I became involved in the tomato-throwing festival in Bu\u00f1ol, in which thousands of people throw thousands of tomatoes at each other for an hour, then spend the next three days being asked why they smell like bruschetta. My co-presenter Jamie Redknapp posted a photo and more than one person said how disgusting all this was, when there are people starving in the world. I always find this a bizarre argument \u2013 one that takes something that your parents used to say to you when you were eight and wouldn\u2019t finish your meal, and uses it to ignore the festival\u2019s cultural history, as well as the huge number of things that are part of our everyday lives and far more abhorrent when it comes to the question of waste. But my issue, in the end, is not with the argument, but with the level of certainty with which the person expressed it. Social media has exacerbated a trend whereby people speak with complete authority on every subject, regardless of how informed they are. I recently filmed a travel show in Mongolia, where we got an eagle to hunt a radio-controlled car with a stuffed fox on it, for creative reasons that I don\u2019t want to get into now. But that scene turned out to be the Pied Piper of trolls, and quite a few came out of the woodwork. There were a lot of people complaining about me enforcing my vegan views on people, but that\u2019s fine \u2013 I respect their right to do so. What got me was one person telling me that the eagle had probably broken its claw and so would have to be released into the wild, as a result of my cruel \u201cprank\u201d. The level of inside knowledge this person claimed to have, about something that five people were present to observe, was breathtaking. From their invented starting point, they extrapolated an angry argument, suggesting that it would have been more humane to use a real fox that would have died. But the eagle did not break its claw. I know this because I was there. On the same show, I went to Colombia and toured the country with the radio host Heisel Mora. While the show was broadcast, a woman tweeted me at various points to inform me that Heisel had not found what I was saying funny, and that she was offended, and that this was why we could never be friends. She knew far more about the week I had spent with Heisel than I did, on the basis of an edited one-hour show. It has been much documented that we have all become experts, but these social media posts are a sign that people are evolving to a place way beyond expertise. We are entering an age where people can claim to know more about what really happened than the people who were there. Where people will dismiss eyewitness accounts, on the basis of their gut feelings; where they will refute scientific discoveries because the scientist just doesn\u2019t look trustworthy. Perhaps this was always a logical next step, now that we are living in times when the people we are supposed to trust are doing so little to earn it. But where will all this lead? Evidence will become irrelevant, arguments will become nonsensical and, worst of all, columnists will try to make wild generalisations about societal behaviour based on three social media posts.",

The last time she returned to the public eye, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/feb/01/katy-perry-super-bowl-half-time-show-review-epic-lung-busting-kitsch\" title=\"\">Katy Perry\u2019s guest during the Super Bowl</a> half-time show in 2015, she \u201cfreaked out\u201d the night before, daunted by the size of the audience and the length of time she had been away. \u201cI ended up in the hospital for having an anxiety attack,\u201d she says. \u201cI think any artist who has had a break such as that one would be anxious. I remember Katy saying: \u2018This is the perfect time to perform your new record. It\u2019s the biggest platform.\u2019 I was like: \u2018I don\u2019t even know if they remember the old ones so I most definitely don\u2019t want to do a new one!\u2019 I\u2019m always anxious whenever I drop anything because you just never know if they\u2019re going to get it. So I\u2019m always biting my nails and pacing the floor.\u201d</p> <p>Elliott was meant to release her long-overdue seventh album that year but after just one brilliant single, WTF (Where They From), she returned to her quieter life as a writer, producer and guest MC. \u201cI hate to say I\u2019m back because in reality I never went nowhere,\u201d she insists. \u201cI was still doing stuff behind the scenes. I don\u2019t always want to be upfront. I\u2019m very shy.\u201d I suggest that anyone watching her fly through the air in an inflatable leather suit at the VMAs would not automatically diagnose her with shyness. \u201cI was like that as a child,\u201d she says. \u201cWe would have family reunions and they always wanted me to get up on the table to perform. After an hour of them begging me, I would finally get on the table and become this other little kid. Then they couldn\u2019t get me off. Once I set foot on the stage, I block out everything. I can be in my own world.\u201d</p> <p>Melissa Elliott first constructed a private world as a child in Virginia. It was a fantastical refuge from a violent father, an abusive cousin and the grind of poverty; when reality fails you, build your own. Behind her bedroom door, she was a star, practising acceptance speeches in the mirror and performing to an audience of dolls. \u201cThe teacher would ask what everyone wanted to be and I said: \u2018I\u2019m going to be a superstar.\u2019 And everyone in the class would laugh. I wonder if those kids remember me to this day, because I remember everyone.\u201d</p> <p>In high school, Elliott formed an R&amp;B group called Fayze, who later signed with the Swing Mob label under the name Sista and moved to New York. But Sista flopped and the Swing Mob crew dissolved, so Elliott didn\u2019t hit her stride until she returned to her home state in 1995 with her best friend and producer Tim \u201cTimbaland\u201d Mosley. \u201cTimbaland was more quiet than me and I\u2019m super-shy so just imagine,\u201d she says. \u201cHe\u2019s most definitely not like that now! Through him I met Pharrell and we all bonded.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d680eb2c998999056bf1b9f36c1f706f0253a557\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d680eb2c998999056bf1b9f36c1f706f0253a557/229_112_1493_895/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Missy Elliott and producer Timbaland in 2004.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Missy Elliott and producer Timbaland in 2004.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jon Furniss/WireImage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Avoiding the radio and MTV, the Virginians tunnelled deep into their imaginations to find genuinely new sounds. Elliott describes one memorable day in Virginia Beach\u2019s Master Sound studio: \u201cI was in the booth doing The Rain [her debut solo single] and I kept hearing: \u2018I hate you so much right now!\u2019 And I was like: \u2018Yo, who is screaming?\u2019 I\u2019m getting so mad. And Pharrell comes knocking on the door and says: \u2018I want you to hear something.\u2019 And he plays it and it\u2019s Kelis. Me and Tim were like: \u2018Man, we wish we had done that record.\u2019 That\u2019s how we pushed each other.\u201d</p> <p>Missy \u201cMisdemeanor\u201d Elliott could do it all \u2013 sing, rap, write, produce \u2013 but what she and Timbaland were doing was so far out that they needed to prove themselves, first by working on Aaliyah\u2019s 1996 album One in a Million. It was the shape of R&amp;B to come: radical yet irresistible. For her own The Rain (Supa Dupa Fly), Elliott cooked up a joyfully bizarre video with director Hype Williams to let people know who they were dealing with. \u201cIt helped people understand the type of artist that I am: witty, with a fun, comical sense, but futuristic, too.\u201d Suddenly, everybody wanted a piece of her.</p> <p>Elliott remembers receiving calls from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/may/21/whitney-houston-hologram-tour-album-broadway-show-planned\" title=\"\">Whitney Houston</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/may/26/mariah-carey-review-royal-albert-hall-london\" title=\"\">Mariah Carey</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jul/25/janet-jacksons-classic-albums-reissued-review\" title=\"\">Janet Jackson</a> in a single month. \u201cIt happened so fast that I\u2019m just now getting a chance to sit back and re-evaluate everything,\u201d she says. \u201cThis year has allowed me to look back over my life and be like: \u2018Wow.\u2019\u201d When she watches the spectacular video for her 1999 single She\u2019s a Bitch, in which she rises out of the ocean like a bald cyborg, she\u2019s amazed. \u201cI think: \u2018Where was my mind at? What space was we in to create records like that?\u2019 So many moments I look back and wish that I knew what I was thinking at the time.\u201d Like a hip-hop Doctor Strange, Elliott was a reality-bender. On hits such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/aug/29/missy-elliott-solo-singles-ranked\" title=\"\">Get Ur Freak On</a> and Work It she made everything elastic \u2013 voice, rhythm, language, body \u2013 until the usual rules ceased to apply. Both avant-garde and platinum-popular, she revolutionised hip-hop and R&amp;B while also wowing the likes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jun/30/thom-yorke-anima-review\" title=\"\">Thom Yorke</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/dec/02/good-bad-queen-review-damon-albarn-blackpool\" title=\"\">Damon Albarn</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/may/10/bjorks-cornucopia-is-this-the-singers-most-ambitious-show-yet\" title=\"\">Bj\u00f6rk</a>. Her videos with Hype Williams and Dave Meyers were no less game-changing than her records, each one a reinvention. She credits Elektra Records for running with her imagination. \u201cNot once did they say: \u2018No, you can\u2019t do this.\u2019 I would bring stuff to them and they\u2019d be like: \u2018Let\u2019s do it.\u2019 The only time you get pushback is when they realise the budget is a million dollars.\u201d She laughs. \u201cThen they\u2019re like: \u2018Wait a minute \u2026 \u2019\u201d</p> <p>Simultaneously, she and Timbaland created startling hits for other artists, including Tweet, Melanie B and Destiny\u2019s Child, featuring a 16-year-old Beyonc\u00e9. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that Beyonc\u00e9 came in and was loud or \u2018Look at me, I\u2019m gonna be the star,\u2019\u201d Elliott remembers. \u201cShe was very sweet. But when she went in the booth, that\u2019s when I knew.\u201d Beyonc\u00e9 later appeared on Elliott\u2019s 2002 track Nothing Out There for Me. \u201cI said: \u2018Hey, I want you to rap a little bit.\u2019 And she was like: \u2018Miss, if I sound crazy, don\u2019t put this out!\u2019 And I said: \u201cTrust me, B, I\u2019m not gonna allow you to sound crazy.\u2019 She went in there and now she\u2019s rapping better than me!\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rOKdATrV4g\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9rOKdATrV4g?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>In recent years, critics have emphasised the political impact of Elliott\u2019s work. By radiating pleasure and freedom while upending expectations about race, gender and body image, she was an empowering figure, although she insists that was a byproduct rather than an agenda. \u201cNever, ever once did I think of making a political statement. I did what I did. I didn\u2019t know that it would become that for others later.\u201d She enjoys it, though. \u201cTo know that it has been taken that way, I\u2019m happy.\u201d</p> <p>Then, in 2005, Elliott effectively put her solo career on ice. What happened? \u201cWell, I\u2019m going to be honest, there were a lot of things,\u201d she says hesitantly. One was overwork. A stranger to holidays, she was always either working on her own music (six albums in eight years) or someone else\u2019s. \u201cI needed to refresh my mind. Then I got sick, so that was another thing.\u201d In 2008, after three years of chronic fatigue and drastic weight loss, she was diagnosed with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/24/missy-elliot-graves-disease\" title=\"\">Graves\u2019 disease</a>, a thyroid disorder, and treated with radiation therapy. Even once she was able to resume recording, Elliott\u2019s hiatus between albums became self-perpetuating: the longer she stayed away, the harder it was to come back. Without deadlines or financial pressure (she invested wisely), her perfectionism took over. She disappeared into the studio, racking up several albums\u2019 worth of unreleased material. \u201cYou end up building up a trillion records,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s easier for me to write for other people and not be as critical. I\u2019m very hard on myself. I\u2019m like: \u2018Let me see if I can make something better,\u2019 so you just keep powering on.\u201d</p> <p>The overwhelming, instant scrutiny of social media exacerbated this self-doubt. Earlier this year, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MissyElliott/status/1092832971957010432\" title=\"\">Cardi B tweeted about anxiety and Elliott </a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/MissyElliott/status/1092832971957010432\" title=\"\">sympathised</a>: \u201cMany people deal with this \u2026 i am one \u2026 it\u2019s real.\u201d This wasn\u2019t something that rappers discussed publicly in the 90s. \u201cAnxiety and depression, I\u2019m not gonna lie, I rarely heard that back then,\u201d she says. \u201cBut now I hear it a lot. Before social media you really didn\u2019t know what people thought of you but now it\u2019s so in your face that I think it probably gives a lot of artists anxiety. You have a lot of people coming at you, good or bad.\u201d So she stuck to supporting roles on records by the likes of Ariana Grande, Janet Jackson, the Missy-indebted Lizzo and debut recording artist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/mar/09/michelle-obama-becoming-book-career\" title=\"\">Michelle Obama</a>: Elliott was the highlight of Obama\u2019s 2016 charity single This Is for My Girls. \u201cI wasn\u2019t gonna say no. Y\u2019know, it\u2019s Michelle Obama. Am I really gonna be like: \u2018Nah Michelle, I\u2019m busy!\u2019 She made me feel she was in my family. I almost forgot she was the First Lady.\u201d</p> <p>Now, finally, Elliott is \u201cmost definitely\u201d ready to take the plunge and release that album, self-doubt be damned. \u201cThis time the label is like: \u2018Knock it off, Missy Misdemeanor Elliott!\u2019 Ha ha!\u201d</p> <p>The good news is that new music means live shows. The bad news is that these might have to take the form of a Las Vegas residency because Elliott\u2019s ideas may be too ambitious to be portable. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a lot because there\u2019s so much going in my mind,\u201d she says. \u201cMy mind is like a rollercoaster. It\u2019s like an amusement park. Heh heh heh.\u201d At long last, Missyland is reopening for business.</p> <p><em>Missy Elliott\u2019s Iconology EP is out now</em></p>",

It\u2019s the biggest platform.\u2019 I was like: \u2018I don\u2019t even know if they remember the old ones so I most definitely don\u2019t want to do a new one!\u2019 I\u2019m always anxious whenever I drop anything because you just never know if they\u2019re going to get it. So I\u2019m always biting my nails and pacing the floor.\u201d Elliott was meant to release her long-overdue seventh album that year but after just one brilliant single, WTF (Where They From), she returned to her quieter life as a writer, producer and guest MC. \u201cI hate to say I\u2019m back because in reality I never went nowhere,\u201d she insists. \u201cI was still doing stuff behind the scenes. I don\u2019t always want to be upfront. I\u2019m very shy.\u201d I suggest that anyone watching her fly through the air in an inflatable leather suit at the VMAs would not automatically diagnose her with shyness. \u201cI was like that as a child,\u201d she says. \u201cWe would have family reunions and they always wanted me to get up on the table to perform. After an hour of them begging me, I would finally get on the table and become this other little kid. Then they couldn\u2019t get me off. Once I set foot on the stage, I block out everything. I can be in my own world.\u201d Melissa Elliott first constructed a private world as a child in Virginia. It was a fantastical refuge from a violent father, an abusive cousin and the grind of poverty; when reality fails you, build your own. Behind her bedroom door, she was a star, practising acceptance speeches in the mirror and performing to an audience of dolls. \u201cThe teacher would ask what everyone wanted to be and I said: \u2018I\u2019m going to be a superstar.\u2019 And everyone in the class would laugh. I wonder if those kids remember me to this day, because I remember everyone.\u201d In high school, Elliott formed an R&amp;B group called Fayze, who later signed with the Swing Mob label under the name Sista and moved to New York. But Sista flopped and the Swing Mob crew dissolved, so Elliott didn\u2019t hit her stride until she returned to her home state in 1995 with her best friend and producer Tim \u201cTimbaland\u201d Mosley. \u201cTimbaland was more quiet than me and I\u2019m super-shy so just imagine,\u201d she says. \u201cHe\u2019s most definitely not like that now! Through him I met Pharrell and we all bonded.\u201d Avoiding the radio and MTV, the Virginians tunnelled deep into their imaginations to find genuinely new sounds. Elliott describes one memorable day in Virginia Beach\u2019s Master Sound studio: \u201cI was in the booth doing The Rain [her debut solo single] and I kept hearing: \u2018I hate you so much right now!\u2019 And I was like: \u2018Yo, who is screaming?\u2019 I\u2019m getting so mad. And Pharrell comes knocking on the door and says: \u2018I want you to hear something.\u2019 And he plays it and it\u2019s Kelis. Me and Tim were like: \u2018Man, we wish we had done that record.\u2019 That\u2019s how we pushed each other.\u201d Missy \u201cMisdemeanor\u201d Elliott could do it all \u2013 sing, rap, write, produce \u2013 but what she and Timbaland were doing was so far out that they needed to prove themselves, first by working on Aaliyah\u2019s 1996 album One in a Million. It was the shape of R&amp;B to come: radical yet irresistible. For her own The Rain (Supa Dupa Fly), Elliott cooked up a joyfully bizarre video with director Hype Williams to let people know who they were dealing with. \u201cIt helped people understand the type of artist that I am: witty, with a fun, comical sense, but futuristic, too.\u201d Suddenly, everybody wanted a piece of her. Elliott remembers receiving calls from Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey and Janet Jackson in a single month. \u201cIt happened so fast that I\u2019m just now getting a chance to sit back and re-evaluate everything,\u201d she says. \u201cThis year has allowed me to look back over my life and be like: \u2018Wow.\u2019\u201d When she watches the spectacular video for her 1999 single She\u2019s a Bitch, in which she rises out of the ocean like a bald cyborg, she\u2019s amazed. \u201cI think: \u2018Where was my mind at? What space was we in to create records like that?\u2019 So many moments I look back and wish that I knew what I was thinking at the time.\u201d Like a hip-hop Doctor Strange, Elliott was a reality-bender. On hits such as Get Ur Freak On and Work It she made everything elastic \u2013 voice, rhythm, language, body \u2013 until the usual rules ceased to apply. Both avant-garde and platinum-popular, she revolutionised hip-hop and R&amp;B while also wowing the likes of Thom Yorke, Damon Albarn and Bj\u00f6rk. Her videos with Hype Williams and Dave Meyers were no less game-changing than her records, each one a reinvention. She credits Elektra Records for running with her imagination. \u201cNot once did they say: \u2018No, you can\u2019t do this.\u2019 I would bring stuff to them and they\u2019d be like: \u2018Let\u2019s do it.\u2019 The only time you get pushback is when they realise the budget is a million dollars.\u201d She laughs. \u201cThen they\u2019re like: \u2018Wait a minute \u2026 \u2019\u201d Simultaneously, she and Timbaland created startling hits for other artists, including Tweet, Melanie B and Destiny\u2019s Child, featuring a 16-year-old Beyonc\u00e9. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that Beyonc\u00e9 came in and was loud or \u2018Look at me, I\u2019m gonna be the star,\u2019\u201d Elliott remembers. \u201cShe was very sweet. But when she went in the booth, that\u2019s when I knew.\u201d Beyonc\u00e9 later appeared on Elliott\u2019s 2002 track Nothing Out There for Me. \u201cI said: \u2018Hey, I want you to rap a little bit.\u2019 And she was like: \u2018Miss, if I sound crazy, don\u2019t put this out!\u2019 And I said: \u201cTrust me, B, I\u2019m not gonna allow you to sound crazy.\u2019 She went in there and now she\u2019s rapping better than me!\u201d In recent years, critics have emphasised the political impact of Elliott\u2019s work. By radiating pleasure and freedom while upending expectations about race, gender and body image, she was an empowering figure, although she insists that was a byproduct rather than an agenda. \u201cNever, ever once did I think of making a political statement. I did what I did. I didn\u2019t know that it would become that for others later.\u201d She enjoys it, though. \u201cTo know that it has been taken that way, I\u2019m happy.\u201d Then, in 2005, Elliott effectively put her solo career on ice. What happened? \u201cWell, I\u2019m going to be honest, there were a lot of things,\u201d she says hesitantly. One was overwork. A stranger to holidays, she was always either working on her own music (six albums in eight years) or someone else\u2019s. \u201cI needed to refresh my mind. Then I got sick, so that was another thing.\u201d In 2008, after three years of chronic fatigue and drastic weight loss, she was diagnosed with Graves\u2019 disease, a thyroid disorder, and treated with radiation therapy. Even once she was able to resume recording, Elliott\u2019s hiatus between albums became self-perpetuating: the longer she stayed away, the harder it was to come back. Without deadlines or financial pressure (she invested wisely), her perfectionism took over. She disappeared into the studio, racking up several albums\u2019 worth of unreleased material. \u201cYou end up building up a trillion records,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s easier for me to write for other people and not be as critical. I\u2019m very hard on myself. I\u2019m like: \u2018Let me see if I can make something better,\u2019 so you just keep powering on.\u201d The overwhelming, instant scrutiny of social media exacerbated this self-doubt. Earlier this year, Cardi B tweeted about anxiety and Elliott sympathised: \u201cMany people deal with this \u2026 i am one \u2026 it\u2019s real.\u201d This wasn\u2019t something that rappers discussed publicly in the 90s. \u201cAnxiety and depression, I\u2019m not gonna lie, I rarely heard that back then,\u201d she says. \u201cBut now I hear it a lot. Before social media you really didn\u2019t know what people thought of you but now it\u2019s so in your face that I think it probably gives a lot of artists anxiety. You have a lot of people coming at you, good or bad.\u201d So she stuck to supporting roles on records by the likes of Ariana Grande, Janet Jackson, the Missy-indebted Lizzo and debut recording artist Michelle Obama: Elliott was the highlight of Obama\u2019s 2016 charity single This Is for My Girls. \u201cI wasn\u2019t gonna say no. Y\u2019know, it\u2019s Michelle Obama. Am I really gonna be like: \u2018Nah Michelle, I\u2019m busy!\u2019 She made me feel she was in my family. I almost forgot she was the First Lady.\u201d Now, finally, Elliott is \u201cmost definitely\u201d ready to take the plunge and release that album, self-doubt be damned. \u201cThis time the label is like: \u2018Knock it off, Missy Misdemeanor Elliott!\u2019 Ha ha!\u201d The good news is that new music means live shows. The bad news is that these might have to take the form of a Las Vegas residency because Elliott\u2019s ideas may be too ambitious to be portable. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a lot because there\u2019s so much going in my mind,\u201d she says. \u201cMy mind is like a rollercoaster. It\u2019s like an amusement park. Heh heh heh.\u201d At long last, Missyland is reopening for business. Missy Elliott\u2019s Iconology EP is out now",

And they were quite sparsely arranged. It\u2019s not like these guys were travelling in herds or in large numbers as has been kind of hypothesised for some of the other megafauna.\u201d</p> <p>The study found that as they evolved, palorchestids grew larger and stranger. While they varied in size, the researchers said they were \u201cbigger than previously thought, with the largest species likely weighing over 1000 kg\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe used a method where you take the circumference of the bone and that tells you something about how much weight is being borne through each of the four legs,\u201d Richards said.</p> <p>\u201cWe came up with a number that was substantially larger than what has been estimated before and puts them some way up there among some of the the largest marsupials that we ever had in Australia.\u201d</p> <p>The fossils were obtained from museums in Australia and London\u2019s Natural History Museum.</p> <p>\u201cWhat makes them so weird is the kind of combination of features that they have,\u201d Richards said.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019ve got an extremely long pointed face, really tiny little eyes, protrusible tongue, something maybe something a bit like a giraffe, and extremely muscular fore quarters ... and huge claws.</p> <p>\u201cSome of the other large megafauna ... like diprotodon they\u2019re not as muscular proportionately as ... and also their claws are much smaller.

      "bodyText": "The \u201cstrange\u201d anatomy of a family of giant marsupials that roamed eastern Australia and Tasmania for much of the past 25m years has been revealed in a new study. Scientists had already figured out that palorchestids had tapir-like skulls and large \u201cscimitar-like claws\u201d, but little was known about the limbs of one of the \u201cstrangest marsupial lineages to have existed\u201d, according to the paper published by a group of Australian researchers. By examining 60 fossil specimens of palorchestids of varying geologic ages, the scientists were able to get an idea of how their legs and arms would have looked, functioned and evolved over time. They found that the palorchestid had \u201cmuscular bent forelimbs\u201d with fixed elbows that were \u201cunlike any of their marsupial kin, living or extinct\u201d, the study published in journal PLOS ONE this week said. \u201cWe are beginning to build a picture of the palorchestids as they were in life,\u201d it said. Palorchestids were a sister family to the better-known Diprotodontidae and became extinct some time during the Late Pleistocene, probably as a result of human activity and climatic change. But mystery has surrounded the exact make-up of palorchestids because very few fossils have been found. What is known is that they died out before other mega-fauna, said the Monash university researcher Hazel Richards. \u201cThe fact that there just aren\u2019t that many of these guys in the fossil record probably tells us something about the way they were distributed,\u201d Richards told Guardian Australia. \u201cWe find them all over Australia but the population size was probably quite small. And they were quite sparsely arranged. It\u2019s not like these guys were travelling in herds or in large numbers as has been kind of hypothesised for some of the other megafauna.\u201d The study found that as they evolved, palorchestids grew larger and stranger. While they varied in size, the researchers said they were \u201cbigger than previously thought, with the largest species likely weighing over 1000 kg\u201d. \u201cWe used a method where you take the circumference of the bone and that tells you something about how much weight is being borne through each of the four legs,\u201d Richards said. \u201cWe came up with a number that was substantially larger than what has been estimated before and puts them some way up there among some of the the largest marsupials that we ever had in Australia.\u201d The fossils were obtained from museums in Australia and London\u2019s Natural History Museum. \u201cWhat makes them so weird is the kind of combination of features that they have,\u201d Richards said. \u201cThey\u2019ve got an extremely long pointed face, really tiny little eyes, protrusible tongue, something maybe something a bit like a giraffe, and extremely muscular fore quarters ... and huge claws. \u201cSome of the other large megafauna ... like diprotodon they\u2019re not as muscular proportionately as ... and also their claws are much smaller. So these guys were clearly specialised for doing something with their forelimbs.\u201d Their claws would have been made digging difficult, \u201clike trying to dig with a chef\u2019s knife\u201d, while their elbows, which could not \u201cbend or straighten, are \u201ctotally unheard of in any other mammal, living or extinct\u201d. Richards said future research would aim to determine why palorchestids came to be how they were. \u201cThe plan now is to zero in and conduct some functional, biomechanical analyses to try and understand exactly what they were adapted for,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat foods are they targeting, why would they have become so different from everything else?\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Helena on Greg What were you hoping for? To meet a guy who didn\u2019t take himself too seriously. First impressions? I wasn\u2019t expecting him to be so good-looking. He tried to stand up to greet me but had his leg in a cast. What did you talk about? He was full of random facts: apparently each Wetherspoon has its own carpet, which is designed by the same person. Every day is a school day, he said, tapping his nose. Any awkward moments? My friend messaged me, asking me to send her a voice note from the toilet to debrief the date, and he saw it pop up on my phone. Good table manners? He said he\u2019d save me a bite of pudding, but polished the whole thing off. Best thing about Greg? His laugh was the loudest I\u2019ve heard. Would you introduce him to your friends? 100%. They\u2019d love him on a dancefloor. Describe Greg in three words Nutty, bubbly, warm. What do you think he made of you? I feel that we gelled quite well \u2013 we spent a lot of time laughing. Did you go on somewhere? We walked/hobbled to a pub down the road. And... did you kiss? No, we were on the tube and it was really busy. If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be? I\u2019d want to go on for a dance somewhere. Marks out of 10? 8.5. Would you meet again? Maybe. Greg on Helena What were you hoping for? To meet someone funny, cute and intelligent \u2013 combined with an evening devoid of embarrassment and/or awkward silences. First impressions? Far less nervous than I was. Tall, pretty and instantly engaging. What did you talk about? My recently snapped achilles tendon, family, travelling, career aspirations, Helena\u2019s love of horticulture, my complete lack of creative flair, and how to utilise certain office paraphernalia to avoid engaging with colleagues when hungover. Any awkward moments? None, although I did accidentally touch her knee a few times as I was gesticulating (that sounds dodgy). Good table manners? Very good. Best thing about Helena? Her infectious personality. Would you introduce her to your friends? Sure, I think they would all like her. Describe Helena in three words Funny, chatty, interesting. What do you think she made of you? She laughed a lot and seemed quite impressed with my love of cooking \u2013 so hopefully she thought well of me. Did you go on somewhere? We went to a pub and had a couple of pints. And... did you kiss? We did not. If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be? Nothing, we got on fantastically and the food was incredible. Marks out of 10? 8. Would you meet again? As friends. I didn\u2019t feel any romance, unfortunately. \u2022 Helena and Greg ate at Cafe Murano, London WC2. Fancy a blind date? Email blind.date@theguardian.com.

      "body": "<p>On the evening I interview <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/burberry\" title=\"\">Burberry</a>\u2019s chief creative officer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/riccardo-tisci\" title=\"\">Riccardo Tisci</a>, London has an atmosphere close to boiling point. A stone\u2019s throw away from the brand\u2019s HQ, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris-johnson\" title=\"\">Boris Johnson</a> has just entered 10 Downing Street for the first time, to jeers from protesters. Anti-Brexit demonstrators roam Parliament Square. Commuters on their way home try to manage the late July heatwave, some with ice lollies, others with pints. Some have given up entirely and are just sitting on the pavement, totally frazzled.</p> <p>Frazzled is not a word that gets much use at the top of Burberry Towers. The rooftop is all members\u2019 club discretion \u2013 bleached wood furniture, bowls of gigantic roses and perfectly chilled, iced sparkling water. The designer has specified this location, where some might have suggested their office, maybe, or a carefully chosen buzzy restaurant. If Burberry is a brand based on a very British weather system of cloudy with a chance of rain, Tisci is different. Born near Lake Como in Italy, he\u2019s accustomed to sunshine.</p> <p>This becomes clear when he sits down and launches into his summer plans. \u201cI am going to Como to celebrate my birthday,\u201d he says. \u201cThen Mykonos\u2026 Me and all best friends who live in different countries, we meet there in August. A nice villa in the middle of nowhere\u2026 I love it. If you want to go and eat fish, you go and eat fish; if you want to sleep, you sleep; or if you want to get drunk all together \u2013 it\u2019s nice. The sea, the food, the fish, the tomatoes, everything.\u201d These words tumble out of Tisci\u2019s mouth, and he finishes with a grin, and a sip of the iced coffee he arrived with. Anyone after more of this scenario would do well to join 2.5m others and follow <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/riccardotisci17/?hl=en\" title=\"\">Tisci on Instagram</a>. This year\u2019s destinations include a boat in Ibiza (he is pictured topless, wetsuit pulled down to his waist) and New York for Pride (surrounded by friends, all in hotpants).

He carries a Burberry bumbag with a packet of American Spirit peeking out. If you didn\u2019t know he was a designer, you might think he worked in the music industry.</p> <p>This look signals that Tisci is a departure for Burberry. <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=Christopher+Bailey&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwidhq_eyJTkAhXjShUIHbXtDLgQ_AUIEigC&amp;biw=1458&amp;bih=1012\" title=\"\">Google Image Christopher Bailey</a>, the previous chief creative officer for 17 years, and you\u2019ll see what I mean. Bailey is much more a crisp shirt and occasional blazer kind of man, the uniform of the discreetly wealthy. Bailey\u2019s collections reflected this taste, too. They often came with a blue-chip British bookish reference \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/sep/10/great-dynasties-bloomsbury-group-ian-sansom\" title=\"\">the Bloomsbury group</a>, say, or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/hockney\" title=\"\">David Hockney</a> \u2013 and a BBC Radio 6 Music-approved sound: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/paloma-faith\" title=\"\">Paloma Faith</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/keane\" title=\"\">Keane</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/jake-bugg\" title=\"\">Jake Bugg</a>. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/samantha-cameron\" title=\"\">Samantha Cameron</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/duchess-of-cambridge\" title=\"\">Kate Middleton</a> wore the clothes.</p> <p>And Bailey\u2019s Burberry was successful. Thanks to him, the brand is now Proper Fashion, with the London fashion week show a hot ticket every season. But Bailey\u2019s Burberry was not really cool. Tisci, by contrast, is one of fashion\u2019s current arbiters of that intangible quality. Previously the creative director of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/givenchy\" title=\"\">Givenchy</a> for 12 years, he designed the wedding outfits for his good friends Kanye and Kim, and has a long-running collaboration with Nike. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/madonna\" title=\"\">Madonna</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/frank-ocean\" title=\"\">Frank Ocean</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/marina-abramovic\" title=\"\">Marina Abramovi\u0107</a> are part of his friendship group (he bought a house with the artist). Since Tisci joined Burberry last year, the brand has worked with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/mia\" title=\"\">MIA</a> (even persuading the edgy musician to appear in the slightly cheesy format of a Christmas advert) and dressed Gen Z favourites <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/ariana-grande\" title=\"\">Ariana Grande</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/rihanna\" title=\"\">Rihanna</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/gigihadid/?hl=en\" title=\"\">Gigi Hadid</a>. Such is Tisci\u2019s influence that model <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/frejaerichsen/?hl=en\" title=\"\">Freja Beha Erichsen</a> \u2013 who is Kind of a Big Deal in fashion, with 24 Vogue covers to her name and a starring role in Burberry\u2019s autumn ad campaign \u2013 rejigged her schedule to be part of this shoot.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"51bd1814142001c1bc269c30dcdcb43e77372343\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/51bd1814142001c1bc269c30dcdcb43e77372343/107_7_2548_1528/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Riccardo Tisci with his good friends Kanye West and Madonna.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Riccardo Tisci with his good friends Kanye West and Madonna.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Mazur/WireImage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At Givenchy, Tisci turned a couture relic most associated with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/audrey-hepburn\" title=\"\">Audrey Hepburn</a>\u2019s LBDs into the height of millennial cool \u2013 specifically appealing to the hypebeast demographic who might also wear streetwear labels <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/mar/16/supremes-hype-game-is-strong-cult-brand-tries-ticketed-fashion\" title=\"\">Supreme</a> and <a href=\"https://shop.palaceskateboards.com/\" title=\"\">Palace</a>. Originally known for his gothic aesthetic, streetwear started appearing on the catwalk around 2011. Hypebeasts swiftly signed up \u2013 they loved the T-shirts with <a href=\"https://www.givenchy.com/gb/en/men/?q=rottweiler*&amp;cmpid&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIi9vbs8uU5AIVCLrtCh3xKApSEAAYASAAEgKF9vD_BwE\" title=\"\">a snarling rottweiler print</a>, the basketball vests, the plaid shirt with studs. And at around \u00a3360 for one of those T-shirts, they were within reach \u2013 more affordable than a four-figure gown, anyway. This was part of the strategy \u2013 that, and his duties as a good uncle. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to go home for Christmas and have my sisters\u2019 kids say, \u2018It\u2019s beautiful, what you do, but I can\u2019t afford it,\u2019\u201d Tisci explains. \u201cThat killed me. I wanted them to come to me and say, \u2018I have been saving money to buy <a href=\"https://www.givenchy.com/gb/en/search?q=Bambi&amp;lang=en\" title=\"\">the Bambi T-shirt</a>.\u2019</p> <p>\u201c[At first], nobody was caring about it. Slowly but slowly, it was selling, selling, getting bigger,\u201d Tisci continues. \u201c[Then] everybody wants a piece and everybody starts doing it. I don\u2019t mind it because whenever the younger generation talk about that, they always mention my name.\u201d Tisci\u2019s success meant high street brands started producing their own take. You might not know his name but he is the reason you have a statement sweatshirt, the reason the phrase \u201cposh tracksuit trousers\u201d is not an oxymoron.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b3741b0d1bf34ae9ba5933d6a26bbf1347620542\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b3741b0d1bf34ae9ba5933d6a26bbf1347620542/19_0_1367_1708/800.jpg\" alt=\"Reworking the check.

Tisci\u2019s Burberry designs bring the classic to the radar of a new generation.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shaniqwa Jarvis/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s no wonder, then, that Tisci is intrigued by a part of Burberry\u2019s history that was, until now, a touchy subject: its association with \u201cchav\u201d culture. In 2002, actor Danniella Westbrook was snapped in a Burberry check skirt with matching handbag. Her daughter wore a matching kilt, and sat in a Burberry check pushchair. The label was also spotted on football terraces. By being associated with the working-classes, the luxury brand was seen as losing its way. While check had already been reintroduced by Bailey, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/jan/06/burberry-check-makes-a-casual-comeback-with-gosha-rubchinskiy\" title=\"\">a 2018 collaboration</a> with streetwear designer Gosha Rubchinskiy, Tisci has reassessed the idea of \u201cchav\u201d. \u201cI know I shouldn\u2019t say it, but last season it was a little bit the inspiration,\u201d he says. \u201cI think it is great because I come from the streets.\u201d The AW collection, entitled Tempest, included streetwear, sophisticated classics and that oh-so-familiar check, reworked with a darker khaki and the punchy graphics that Tisci fans flock to.</p> <p>Designers from humble backgrounds are nothing new \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/alexander-mcqueen\" title=\"\">Alexander McQueen</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/vivienne-westwood\" title=\"\">Vivienne Westwood</a>, Bailey himself - but Tisci has a genuine rags to riches story. Born in 1974, he grew up the youngest child \u2013 and only boy \u2013 of nine children. He wore his sisters\u2019 pink hand-me-downs to school. His father died when Tisci was four and the siblings had to work to keep the family afloat. He has spoken before about one meal a day being the norm, how he was helping his uncle with plastering from the age of 11. It\u2019s all a long way from rooftops with a view of the Houses of Parliament.</p> <p>Tisci\u2019s unlikely success is, he says, down to \u201cangels I have crossed in my life\u201d. The first arrived when he stopped attending primary school. \u201cThe teachers came to my house, Miss Besio and Mr Borriero. They said to my mum, \u2018Your son needs to study because he has something different to all the other children.\u2019\u201d Tisci stayed in school. This continued in London \u2013 on an internship, fellow designer <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/antonioberardiofficial/?hl=en\" title=\"\">Antonio Berardi</a> saw his illustrations and sent Tisci to renowned fashion college Central Saint Martins. While there, tutor <a href=\"https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/tags/people/willie-walters\" title=\"\">Willie Walters</a> ensured he received a grant so he was able to study. Tisci was made creative director of Givenchy in 2005, aged 29. \u201cI am a self-made person,\u201d he says now, with a drag of an American Spirit. \u201cMy mum gave me love but that is the only thing she gave me.\u201d (Tisci is prone to these telenovela-ish soundbites, which is understandable when you find out he has a story worthy of a box set.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e4a92c3ea2a545a2f0c0cabdfad7a18f1fca3ab5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e4a92c3ea2a545a2f0c0cabdfad7a18f1fca3ab5/0_469_4652_2792/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rihanna wears a Burberry trench on stage at a Fenty Beauty event.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rihanna wears a Burberry trench on stage at a Fenty Beauty event.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Ganzon/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tisci sees a kindred spirit in <a href=\"https://www.burberryplc.com/en/company/history.html\" title=\"\">Thomas Burberry</a>, who started the eponymous brand in 1856, at the age of 21, in the far from fashionable environs of Basingstoke. He invented gabardine, the waterproof fabric that went on to be used for the trenchcoat, in 1879. Adopted by explorers and intrepid types including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2015/may/21/ernest-shackletons-endurance-expedition\" title=\"\">Ernest Shackleton</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Bmi8gnFHXJn/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;hl=en\" title=\"\">Betty Kirby-Green</a>, Burberry trenches were worn in the trenches in the first world war. By 1965, it\u2019s said that one in every five coats exported from the UK was made by Burberry.

      "bodyText": "On the evening I interview Burberry\u2019s chief creative officer Riccardo Tisci, London has an atmosphere close to boiling point. A stone\u2019s throw away from the brand\u2019s HQ, Boris Johnson has just entered 10 Downing Street for the first time, to jeers from protesters. Anti-Brexit demonstrators roam Parliament Square. Commuters on their way home try to manage the late July heatwave, some with ice lollies, others with pints. Some have given up entirely and are just sitting on the pavement, totally frazzled. Frazzled is not a word that gets much use at the top of Burberry Towers. The rooftop is all members\u2019 club discretion \u2013 bleached wood furniture, bowls of gigantic roses and perfectly chilled, iced sparkling water. The designer has specified this location, where some might have suggested their office, maybe, or a carefully chosen buzzy restaurant. If Burberry is a brand based on a very British weather system of cloudy with a chance of rain, Tisci is different. Born near Lake Como in Italy, he\u2019s accustomed to sunshine. This becomes clear when he sits down and launches into his summer plans. \u201cI am going to Como to celebrate my birthday,\u201d he says. \u201cThen Mykonos\u2026 Me and all best friends who live in different countries, we meet there in August. A nice villa in the middle of nowhere\u2026 I love it. If you want to go and eat fish, you go and eat fish; if you want to sleep, you sleep; or if you want to get drunk all together \u2013 it\u2019s nice. The sea, the food, the fish, the tomatoes, everything.\u201d These words tumble out of Tisci\u2019s mouth, and he finishes with a grin, and a sip of the iced coffee he arrived with. Anyone after more of this scenario would do well to join 2.5m others and follow Tisci on Instagram. This year\u2019s destinations include a boat in Ibiza (he is pictured topless, wetsuit pulled down to his waist) and New York for Pride (surrounded by friends, all in hotpants). Or look up his 40th birthday in Ibiza \u2013 a decadent affair with Kate Moss, Kanye West, Kim Kardashian, Kendall Jenner and Naomi Campbell attending. Today, like most days, the gym-honed 45-year-old \u2013 \u201cI am Leo with a moon ascending Gemini\u201d \u2013 wears a black T-shirt of his own design with TB (Thomas Burberry) logo, black basketball shorts and well-worn, even slightly bobbly, black Nike socks with swoosh. He carries a Burberry bumbag with a packet of American Spirit peeking out. If you didn\u2019t know he was a designer, you might think he worked in the music industry. This look signals that Tisci is a departure for Burberry. Google Image Christopher Bailey, the previous chief creative officer for 17 years, and you\u2019ll see what I mean. Bailey is much more a crisp shirt and occasional blazer kind of man, the uniform of the discreetly wealthy. Bailey\u2019s collections reflected this taste, too. They often came with a blue-chip British bookish reference \u2013 the Bloomsbury group, say, or David Hockney \u2013 and a BBC Radio 6 Music-approved sound: Paloma Faith, Keane, Jake Bugg. Samantha Cameron and Kate Middleton wore the clothes. And Bailey\u2019s Burberry was successful. Thanks to him, the brand is now Proper Fashion, with the London fashion week show a hot ticket every season. But Bailey\u2019s Burberry was not really cool. Tisci, by contrast, is one of fashion\u2019s current arbiters of that intangible quality. Previously the creative director of Givenchy for 12 years, he designed the wedding outfits for his good friends Kanye and Kim, and has a long-running collaboration with Nike. Madonna, Frank Ocean and Marina Abramovi\u0107 are part of his friendship group (he bought a house with the artist). Since Tisci joined Burberry last year, the brand has worked with MIA (even persuading the edgy musician to appear in the slightly cheesy format of a Christmas advert) and dressed Gen Z favourites Ariana Grande, Rihanna and Gigi Hadid. Such is Tisci\u2019s influence that model Freja Beha Erichsen \u2013 who is Kind of a Big Deal in fashion, with 24 Vogue covers to her name and a starring role in Burberry\u2019s autumn ad campaign \u2013 rejigged her schedule to be part of this shoot. At Givenchy, Tisci turned a couture relic most associated with Audrey Hepburn\u2019s LBDs into the height of millennial cool \u2013 specifically appealing to the hypebeast demographic who might also wear streetwear labels Supreme and Palace. Originally known for his gothic aesthetic, streetwear started appearing on the catwalk around 2011. Hypebeasts swiftly signed up \u2013 they loved the T-shirts with a snarling rottweiler print, the basketball vests, the plaid shirt with studs. And at around \u00a3360 for one of those T-shirts, they were within reach \u2013 more affordable than a four-figure gown, anyway. This was part of the strategy \u2013 that, and his duties as a good uncle. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to go home for Christmas and have my sisters\u2019 kids say, \u2018It\u2019s beautiful, what you do, but I can\u2019t afford it,\u2019\u201d Tisci explains. \u201cThat killed me. I wanted them to come to me and say, \u2018I have been saving money to buy the Bambi T-shirt.\u2019 \u201c[At first], nobody was caring about it. Slowly but slowly, it was selling, selling, getting bigger,\u201d Tisci continues. \u201c[Then] everybody wants a piece and everybody starts doing it. I don\u2019t mind it because whenever the younger generation talk about that, they always mention my name.\u201d Tisci\u2019s success meant high street brands started producing their own take. You might not know his name but he is the reason you have a statement sweatshirt, the reason the phrase \u201cposh tracksuit trousers\u201d is not an oxymoron. It\u2019s no wonder, then, that Tisci is intrigued by a part of Burberry\u2019s history that was, until now, a touchy subject: its association with \u201cchav\u201d culture. In 2002, actor Danniella Westbrook was snapped in a Burberry check skirt with matching handbag. Her daughter wore a matching kilt, and sat in a Burberry check pushchair. The label was also spotted on football terraces. By being associated with the working-classes, the luxury brand was seen as losing its way. While check had already been reintroduced by Bailey, with a 2018 collaboration with streetwear designer Gosha Rubchinskiy, Tisci has reassessed the idea of \u201cchav\u201d. \u201cI know I shouldn\u2019t say it, but last season it was a little bit the inspiration,\u201d he says. \u201cI think it is great because I come from the streets.\u201d The AW collection, entitled Tempest, included streetwear, sophisticated classics and that oh-so-familiar check, reworked with a darker khaki and the punchy graphics that Tisci fans flock to. Designers from humble backgrounds are nothing new \u2013 Alexander McQueen, Vivienne Westwood, Bailey himself - but Tisci has a genuine rags to riches story. Born in 1974, he grew up the youngest child \u2013 and only boy \u2013 of nine children. He wore his sisters\u2019 pink hand-me-downs to school. His father died when Tisci was four and the siblings had to work to keep the family afloat. He has spoken before about one meal a day being the norm, how he was helping his uncle with plastering from the age of 11. It\u2019s all a long way from rooftops with a view of the Houses of Parliament. Tisci\u2019s unlikely success is, he says, down to \u201cangels I have crossed in my life\u201d. The first arrived when he stopped attending primary school. \u201cThe teachers came to my house, Miss Besio and Mr Borriero. They said to my mum, \u2018Your son needs to study because he has something different to all the other children.\u2019\u201d Tisci stayed in school. This continued in London \u2013 on an internship, fellow designer Antonio Berardi saw his illustrations and sent Tisci to renowned fashion college Central Saint Martins. While there, tutor Willie Walters ensured he received a grant so he was able to study. Tisci was made creative director of Givenchy in 2005, aged 29. \u201cI am a self-made person,\u201d he says now, with a drag of an American Spirit. \u201cMy mum gave me love but that is the only thing she gave me.\u201d (Tisci is prone to these telenovela-ish soundbites, which is understandable when you find out he has a story worthy of a box set.) Tisci sees a kindred spirit in Thomas Burberry, who started the eponymous brand in 1856, at the age of 21, in the far from fashionable environs of Basingstoke. He invented gabardine, the waterproof fabric that went on to be used for the trenchcoat, in 1879. Adopted by explorers and intrepid types including Ernest Shackleton and Betty Kirby-Green, Burberry trenches were worn in the trenches in the first world war. By 1965, it\u2019s said that one in every five coats exported from the UK was made by Burberry. These days, the brand employs around 10,000 people and is the only luxury fashion brand in the FTSE 100. It also looms large in British style. In the time I have been working on this interview, I have seen Tisci-designed Burberry tote bags on the tube, the check on a woman\u2019s scarf in the supermarket, a trench, with rolled-up check sleeves, in a cocktail bar. Tisci says Thomas is central to his reworking of Burberry, so much so that he changed the Burberry logo \u2013 with the help of Peter Saville \u2013 to feature the founder\u2019s initials. \u201cThe company should still be an institution but at the same time we need to have the perception of human,\u201d Tisci says. \u201cIt\u2019s not only a business company.\u201d That may seem a bit soppy to any board members reading this, but his nose for hits is well-known \u2013 Burberry\u2019s share price went up 5% when his appointment was announced. There\u2019s still work to do, though: even after a 4% rise in sales, analysts at the Bernstein Group downgraded Burberry to \u201cunderperform\u201d in August. Tisci\u2019s track record for courting millennials suggests this is just a blip. He\u2019s started Burberry\u2019s B Series which plays into the \u201cdrop\u201d culture of streetwear \u2013 a new product is released on the 17th of each month (August\u2019s was a dog hoodie, personalisable with the lucky pooch\u2019s name), and reliably sells out in minutes. Another addition is T-shirts, scarves and bags covered in unicorns. If that sounds like a cynical ploy to appeal to fans of emojis and pool inflatables, the story has the authenticity this cohort highly prizes. A search of the archive revealed an alternative insignia from the brand\u2019s famous knight \u2013 a unicorn, designed by Burberry for his family. \u201cIn the day it was a horse, in the night it became a unicorn,\u201d Tisci says. \u201cI thought it was a very beautiful thing. In a way, it\u2019s very relatable to what happened in my life\u2026 My sisters were like Thomas Burberry. During the day, they have to be strong warriors, but in the night they would take off all this armour and be very sweet mothers to me.\u201d Family comes first for Tisci. He remains very close to his mother, who is now 90. His formative experiences of fashion came from watching his eight sisters \u2013 who, he says, are four pairs of best friends \u2013 get ready to go out, when he was a child. \u201cThey would be in the bathroom, putting makeup on. I was sitting on the bathtub thinking, one day I can go out and meet the people around the world.\u201d Tisci has said before that he took the Givenchy job so he could buy his mother a house. His break with the brand was also prompted by family \u2013 at the funeral of his brother-in-law in 2016, he realised his mother was getting older, his nieces and nephews were growing up. And he wanted in. \u201cI wanted to be the son of my mother, the brother of my sister, that I have never been really because life never gave me the opportunity,\u201d he says. He quit Givenchy the following spring. The announcement went out while he was in a desert in Algeria, with his phone switched off. The next year was low-key. He had, he says, \u201cno agenda\u201d. \u201cLike anyone when you are busy, you have a PA, a PR,\u201d he says. \u201cSometimes you want to go to buy your toothpaste, you want to discover what is the new cream for your skin, not always have somebody going for you.\u201d He slept a lot and he travelled, going to Portugal with his family and backpacking around Costa Rica. That is, until Burberry called. Tisci was brought back to fashion by the man who brought him into it in the first place \u2013 Marco Gobbetti, now CEO of Burberry (with an annual salary of \u00a37.3m, as was recently revealed), but then at Givenchy. \u201cMarco is the person who saved my career and gave me the opportunity to be who I am today,\u201d Tisci says, with that frisson of drama. The trench was also enticing. \u201cWhen you behave well at school, in France you get the Chanel bag,\u201d he says. \u201cIn England you get the Burberry trench. It\u2019s something I discovered here. Adele told me the first thing she bought when her first single came out was a Burberry trench.\u201d Tisci\u2019s first collection for Burberry featured 20 trenches. But will the perception of a brand \u2013 and an item \u2013 so associated with Britishness change post-Brexit? \u201cBritish is not my culture but I am representing a very important British house,\u201d Tisci says. \u201cFor me to celebrate Britishness and bring it to America, China, it\u2019s very important.\u201d I would guess Tisci was Remain \u2013 inclusivity and diversity are his MO. He championed casting people of colour well before the rest of fashion woke up to the idea. He also cast his friend Lea T, a trans woman, in an ad campaign in 2010, helping her financially and opening the door to models such as Hari Nef, Andreja Pejic and Nathan Westling. \u201cI got so much shit. You cannot imagine,\u201d he says. \u201cThank God we had people like Oprah Winfrey who said, \u2018Stop a second, he is doing something that is right.\u2019 When somebody more powerful says something, it changes.\u201d Family Tisci were a support network, too. \u201cWhen she [Lea T] decided to become a woman and her family didn\u2019t accept her, my mum took her to our house and she lived with us,\u201d he says. \u201cShe treated Lea as a daughter. Lea still says, \u2018Your mum is the first person to call me she, not he.\u2019\u201d Tisci is definitely an ally to a socially aware generation (Burberry\u2019s policy of burning clothes and its use of fur ended soon after he joined). But he doesn\u2019t always get it right. There was a skirmish after the autumn show when model Liz Kennedy compared the fastening on a hoodie to a noose on social media. \u201cSuicide is not fashion,\u201d she wrote. \u201cRiccardo Tisci and everyone at Burberry it is beyond me how you could let a look resembling a noose hanging from a neck out on the runway.\u201d While other brands have seen items that cause offence reach stores \u2013 both Gucci and Prada have had scandals around designs with racist imagery \u2013 this was swiftly shut down. In a statement, Tisci said, \u201cIt does not reflect my values nor Burberry\u2019s and we have removed it from the collection.\u201d While Tisci says he isn\u2019t a political person, he does concede he has a platform. \u201cIf it\u2019s to fight for rights, to help people, I am the first one,\u201d he says. \u201cIf it\u2019s about going to sit at a table and talk about money, numbers and power, that is, like you say here, not my cup of tea.\u201d Now back in London for over a year, Tisci lives in Mayfair (he did consider Marylebone, where his friend Madonna has a house), trains every day in a local gym and watches what he eats. Then, once in a while, he lets himself go. Tisci has gone to raves, festivals \u2013 \u201cI never thought I would be a festival person\u201d \u2013 and gigs: Rosal\u00eda, the buzzy Spanish singer, Bj\u00f6rk, Primal Scream. The evening we speak, he is having drinks with singer Dua Lipa. Next up, his birthday, celebrated quietly with family. I\u2019m not taking his word for it \u2013 it\u2019s all documented on Instagram a few days later. The designer looks content, lake in the background, Aperol spritz on the table, surrounded by his sisters and mother. Rooftops in London are all very well but for Tisci, there\u2019s still no place like home.",

      "bodyText": "At the 2016 Democratic national convention in Philadelphia, Michael Bloomberg, former New York mayor and the ninth richest man in the world, savaged Donald Trump with a primetime verbal beatdown: \u201cTrump says he wants to run the nation like he\u2019s run his business. God help us.\u201d Looking back, Bloomberg got it right. But his speech wooed few beyond the convention site or the precincts of upper-income America. Instead, he reminded viewers of the ineptitude of Bill de Blasio, his successor as mayor and a 2020 presidential wannabe, and that Wall Street liked Hillary Clinton. On election day 2016, Pennsylvania, the convention\u2019s host state, went Republican for the first time in nearly 30 years. Not exactly \u201cmission accomplished\u201d. Eleanor Randolph, a veteran New York Times writer, attempts to encapsulate Bloomberg\u2019s legacy.

Rebekah Neumann introduced him to the Kabbalah, the esoteric Jewish faith once followed by Madonna. Rebekah Neumann has said when she met Neumann he was too thin and smoking too many cigarettes. She told him to ditch the suitcases of ill-fitting rompers and stop talking about money. \u201cWe\u2019re going to talk about wellness, happiness, fulfillment, and if the money is supposed to follow, it will,\u201d she told him.</p> <p>And it has, to an extent that has worried some investors and corporate governance experts. Part of investors\u2019 anxiety about WeWork is the unusually large amount Neumann has already taken out of the company \u2013 $700m \u2013 in a series of unorthodox personal loans, real estate leases and stock sales ahead of its initial public offering (IPO).</p> <p>Neumann also owns at least four buildings that he rents to WeWork, thus collecting $20m in rent from his own company. And WeWork still owes Neumann an amazing $236.6m in \u201cfuture undiscounted minimum lease payments\u201d.</p> <p>Until last month, when an effort to appease potential investors caused a rethink, he was also collecting $7.9m a year renting the \u201cwe\u201d trademark to the company.</p> <p>Moreover, WeWork\u2019s IPO prospectus explicitly warned investors: \u201cAdam\u2019s voting control will limit the ability of other stockholders to influence corporate activities and, as a result, we may take actions that stockholders other than Adam do not view as beneficial.\u201d</p> <p>In other words, if you don\u2019t like it, get lost.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2049be548f75801e0c3aca1296d4171e8a7b1c1f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2049be548f75801e0c3aca1296d4171e8a7b1c1f/0_240_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Adam Neumann, center, attends the opening bell ceremony at Nasdaq in New York, on 16 January 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Adam Neumann, center, attends the opening bell ceremony at Nasdaq in New York, on 16 January 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Lennihan/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe revelations have ambushed this pristine brand image and undermined the confidence of investors,\u201d Eric Schiffer, chief executive of the investment firm Patriarch, said. \u201cGiven the prospect of losing $6bn, they\u2019d be crazy not to move forward, and quickly.\u201d</p> <p>On Friday <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/wework-to-list-shares-on-nasdaq-make-governance-changes-11568348421?mod=hp_lead_pos2\">the Wall Street Journal</a> reported We was making moves to reassure investors. The company is telling investors it will reduce the power of Neumann\u2019s voting rights to 10 votes a share from 20 votes a share and eliminate the role his wife would serve in choosing Neumann\u2019s successor if he cannot serve.</p> <p>The question before investors now is whether or not they buy the idea that Neumann is a visionary such as Elon Musk or Mark Zuckerberg. For Schiffer, the answer is no. \u201cMusk has a proven track record; Neumann\u2019s history does not show that. He\u2019s had one idea that could prove successful but it\u2019s a giant question mark.\u201d</p> <p>There is no doubt that Neumann has had an impact on office rentals. His idea was to rent real estate on long-term leases, parcel it up with some millennial styling (beer taps, lots of plants and cool sofas) and rent it out short-term. Started in 2010 from a single building on New York\u2019s Grand Street, Neumann found there was ready army of backpacking, laptop-wielding, earbudded young urban professionals who needed somewhere to drink coffee, work on startups, network and pick up partners.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Musk has a proven track record; Neumann\u2019s history does not show that</p> <footer> <cite>Eric Schiffer</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As of 30 June, WeWork reported that it has 527,000 members and 528 locations, up from 485 in March, and said it plans to open 169 new locations. In London, it owns or leases more spaces than any enterprise except the government. Larger companies (including the Guardian) now rent WeWork space.</p> <p>Adam and Rebekah Neumann, of course, aren\u2019t dumb enough to rent. They own an impressive spread of real estate, including a townhouse in New York\u2019s West Village.</p> <p>But like many so-called \u201cunicorns\u201d, private companies valued at more than $1bn, the only way to survive is to expand.

      "bodyText": "\u2018We dedicate this to the power of We \u2013 greater than any one of us, but inside each of us,\u201d proclaims the prospectus for office-sharing company WeWork\u2019s forthcoming share sale. On Monday co-founder Adam Neumann will start trying to sell that vision to potential investors. The signs are not good. After years of hype, Neumann\u2019s plan to become one of the world\u2019s richest entrepreneurs on the back of a 22% stake in WeWork, now known as the We Company, have been hit hard. The value of the company has been cut from $47bn to as low as $15bn. Even their major investor, the Japanese, Saudi-backed SoftBank, has reportedly argued against pressing ahead with the sale, a delay that threatens a $6bn loan needed to fund an aggressive global expansion of the brand. It\u2019s a major dent to Neumann\u2019s dream to build a multibillion-dollar global space-sharing real estate firm built on the trust and community spirit of \u201cwe\u201d and the vision \u201cto elevate the world\u2019s consciousness\u201d. The share sale comes as investors have become increasingly skeptical of profit-free tech, or tech-related, companies that have built their businesses on piles of Silicon Valley cash. Those investors have been burned by offerings by the ridesharing companies Uber and Lyft and watched as Neumann, whose first forays into entrepreneurship were a collapsible high heel for women and a baby romper with reinforced knees, has marketed his \u201cwe\u201d concept with an evangelism that often veers into faux-spiritualism. To believe in \u201cwe\u201d investors will have to overlook losses of $3bn in the last three years and stick with a belief in Neumann, whose almost complete control of We through a dual-class share structure gives investors cause for concern. But Neumann lacks nothing if not self-belief. Forty years old, 6ft 5in tall and sporting a mane of dark hair, Neumann grew up on an Israeli kibbutz and moved to New York in 2001 to \u201chave fun and make a lot of money\u201d, as he told a commencement ceremony at the college where he met his wife, Rebekah, n\u00e9e Rebekah Paltrow, sister of the actor Gwyneth. Any confusion as to the scale of Neumann\u2019s ambition was put to rest earlier this year when he told New York magazine that WeWork\u2019s size and scale could put it in a position to help deal with some of the world\u2019s largest problems, including migration and refugees. \u201cI need to have the biggest valuation I can, because when countries are shooting at each other, I want them to come to me,\u201d he said. Much of We\u2019s new age spiritualism seems to stem from his wife. Rebekah Neumann introduced him to the Kabbalah, the esoteric Jewish faith once followed by Madonna. Rebekah Neumann has said when she met Neumann he was too thin and smoking too many cigarettes. She told him to ditch the suitcases of ill-fitting rompers and stop talking about money. \u201cWe\u2019re going to talk about wellness, happiness, fulfillment, and if the money is supposed to follow, it will,\u201d she told him. And it has, to an extent that has worried some investors and corporate governance experts. Part of investors\u2019 anxiety about WeWork is the unusually large amount Neumann has already taken out of the company \u2013 $700m \u2013 in a series of unorthodox personal loans, real estate leases and stock sales ahead of its initial public offering (IPO). Neumann also owns at least four buildings that he rents to WeWork, thus collecting $20m in rent from his own company. And WeWork still owes Neumann an amazing $236.6m in \u201cfuture undiscounted minimum lease payments\u201d. Until last month, when an effort to appease potential investors caused a rethink, he was also collecting $7.9m a year renting the \u201cwe\u201d trademark to the company. Moreover, WeWork\u2019s IPO prospectus explicitly warned investors: \u201cAdam\u2019s voting control will limit the ability of other stockholders to influence corporate activities and, as a result, we may take actions that stockholders other than Adam do not view as beneficial.\u201d In other words, if you don\u2019t like it, get lost. \u201cThe revelations have ambushed this pristine brand image and undermined the confidence of investors,\u201d Eric Schiffer, chief executive of the investment firm Patriarch, said. \u201cGiven the prospect of losing $6bn, they\u2019d be crazy not to move forward, and quickly.\u201d On Friday the Wall Street Journal reported We was making moves to reassure investors. The company is telling investors it will reduce the power of Neumann\u2019s voting rights to 10 votes a share from 20 votes a share and eliminate the role his wife would serve in choosing Neumann\u2019s successor if he cannot serve. The question before investors now is whether or not they buy the idea that Neumann is a visionary such as Elon Musk or Mark Zuckerberg. For Schiffer, the answer is no. \u201cMusk has a proven track record; Neumann\u2019s history does not show that. He\u2019s had one idea that could prove successful but it\u2019s a giant question mark.\u201d There is no doubt that Neumann has had an impact on office rentals. His idea was to rent real estate on long-term leases, parcel it up with some millennial styling (beer taps, lots of plants and cool sofas) and rent it out short-term. Started in 2010 from a single building on New York\u2019s Grand Street, Neumann found there was ready army of backpacking, laptop-wielding, earbudded young urban professionals who needed somewhere to drink coffee, work on startups, network and pick up partners. As of 30 June, WeWork reported that it has 527,000 members and 528 locations, up from 485 in March, and said it plans to open 169 new locations. In London, it owns or leases more spaces than any enterprise except the government. Larger companies (including the Guardian) now rent WeWork space. Adam and Rebekah Neumann, of course, aren\u2019t dumb enough to rent. They own an impressive spread of real estate, including a townhouse in New York\u2019s West Village. But like many so-called \u201cunicorns\u201d, private companies valued at more than $1bn, the only way to survive is to expand. There\u2019s no guarantee WeWork will ever reach profitability, as it makes clear in its prospectus. Investors are worried, especially as the company\u2019s expansion is focused on China, an unknown quantity at the best of times and especially now, potentially heading into a global recession and as rivals copy many of its moves. The unfolding drama has already hit Neumann\u2019s wealth prospects. At one point, some estimated WeWork\u2019s value as a listed company could soon reach $65bn, valuing Neumann\u2019s stake at $14bn. At the $15bn valuation now looking more likely, Neumann\u2019s stake would be worth $3bn \u2013 not enough for a listing in the 500-member Bloomberg Billionaires Index \u2013 but still not bad for a decade\u2019s work. Over the next few weeks, Neumann and We Company will see how their neo-utopian vision meshes with the hard realities of the public marketplace. \u201cWe are captivated by the limitless potential of We,\u201d Neumann said recently. Wall Street seems less sure. \ufeff",

      "bodyText": "Anyone who has walked down a British high street recently will not be surprised by the latest news on their dire state. A report by the Local Data Company and PricewaterhouseCoopers reveals that chain-store closures are at their highest level since their audit began in 2010. On Britain\u2019s top 500 high streets, 1,234 shops shut in the first half of 2019. This is the new reality. Former anchor tenants have either sunk (BHS, Toys R Us) or, like M&amp;S, Debenhams and House of Fraser, are shutting stores to stay afloat. At Topshop, New Look and Monsoon, a company voluntary arrangement (financial first aid for ailing brands) is this season\u2019s must-have accessory. Austerity, business-rate hikes and high rents have compounded the problem but, fundamentally, the rise of online shopping means we are deserting physical shops in a way that, ideally, would demand a complete rethink of the retail core around which towns orbit. Certainly, attempts to save the high street as it is currently constituted seem doomed. \u201cShowrooming\u201d \u2013 people trying on clothes in-store but buying them cheaper online \u2013 was briefly touted as the future for physical shops, which would function as \u201cexperiential\u201d brand hubs: less shop, more a day out. But the rapid rise of online-only fashion retailers such as Boohoo, Missguided and Asos made that concept redundant. Online fashion sales doubled between 2012 and 2017, by which point online-only retailers owned 40% of that market, says market-research company Mintel. Indeed, the new battleground is online brands versus \u201cserial returners\u201d, who buy-to-try garments then send them back for free, creating what Barclays has dubbed a \u00a37bn \u201cphantom economy\u201d. Simultaneously, banks are closing branches (as are letting agents, job agencies, post offices), often despite the needs of older, low-income groups. The picture is a bit different in areas without easy access to credit or transport, where out of necessity people still shop locally. There, physical stores are clinging on longer, as landlords hold on to bookies, pound shops, discount food stores, chemists and charity shops (a top five growing sector, reports PwC, bleakly) as a durable source of income. Overall, however, there are just fewer and fewer drivers of footfall. You cannot get your hair cut online, so barbers \u2013 like nail bars, tattoo parlours and tanning salons \u2013 buck the downward trend. But we only need so many of these. Greggs and to-go food stores are buoyant; gyms and takeaways are the only sectors showing double-digit net growth, says PwC. But even that feels precarious. Delivery apps are driving growth in the takeaway sector but, if in-person purchases fall, these could quickly migrate to so-called dark kitchens on industrial estates. \u201cThe reality is we may need fewer high streets in the future,\u201d says a PwC spokesperson. \u201cThis opens opportunities to repurpose high street space, while [evolving] to meet consumer demand.\u201d But what will that look like? In 2011 Mary Portas, retail expert and Cameron-era government consultant, lobbied for an anti-clone-town drive to remodel high streets around independent shops. But bar a few niche fashion, gift or record shops, supermarkets marched relentlessly on. The butcher, baker and candlestick-maker now work in Tesco.

      "body": "<p>My parents are dead now, and I think about them both every day. They loved the cinema, and would go all the time as a young couple. My mum had a crush on the young Marlon Brando after seeing him in On The Waterfront and as Mark Antony in Julius Caesar. But it was my dad who was the more voluble about film, if not necessarily the more opinionated.</p> <p>Albert Desmond Bradshaw came to London from Belfast in the 1950s to be a photographer. That was where he met my mum, Mollie, who was working as a secretary. They lived in Highgate, north London and were a hip couple-about-town before my sister, Sarah, and I came along; they then moved to a cottage in Letchmore Heath, near Watford. If I had to cast Dad in a film, I\u2019d suggest Adrian Dunbar \u2013 although Dad was tall and beanpole-thin when we were growing up, with an expression of droll disapproval, which we loved as kids, but found infuriating as stroppy teenagers. He loved watching films on TV with us and, to everyone\u2019s rage, talking over the dialogue when he semi-recognised an actor: \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026! That\u2019s\u2026! Come on, Peter, you know, who is it?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"195d00334edcfd0b12e48ef98f8680728ef7fed2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/195d00334edcfd0b12e48ef98f8680728ef7fed2/0_934_1688_2549/662.jpg\" alt=\"Albert and Peter Bradshaw at the latter\u2019s graduation.\" width=\"662\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Albert and Peter Bradshaw at the latter\u2019s graduation.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy of Peter Bradshaw</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mum would take us to the cinema as a treat in the holidays: Mary Poppins, The Jungle Book. But it was my dad who got me into watching films. I\u2019ll never forget being about 10 or 11 with Sarah at the dinner table, and asking my parents about a film called Psycho, which I had seen in the TV listings. (It sounded like something I would buy at the shops, like Rolo or Toffo.) Dad launched into a description of the first bit of the film, including Anthony Perkins spying on the naked Janet Leigh in the shower. He even asked me and Sarah if we understood why he should want to be spying on her. My memory is that we nodded, dumbly, but for all we knew of nightmarish sexual obsession and misogynistic violence, Dad could have been describing a tea-making ceremony on Pluto. The discussion ended there. I had no idea what the later, legendary \u201cshower\u201d scene was like until I watched the film as a student.</p> <p>My dad told me to watch the 1949 Ealing classic Kind Hearts And Coronets, directed by Robert Hamer, with Dennis Price as the serial killer Louis, elegantly murdering members of the aristocratic D\u2019Ascoyne family (all played by Alec Guinness) so he can become duke. It seemed to be on TV all the time in the 70s. My dad adored the scene in which young photographer Henry D\u2019Ascoyne and Louis exchange camera chat outside the country pub. (\u201cExcuse me. Isn\u2019t that a Thornton Pickard? \u2013 Yes. Are you a photographer? \u2013 Dabble in it. Got a Sanger Shepherd!\u201d)</p> <p>Before setting up in photography on his own, Dad was assistant to the noted photographer Maurice Broomfield, who recorded postwar industrial Britain and was the father of the documentary film-maker Nick Broomfield. Dad took a lot of photographs for the Financial Times in the 50s, but they are untraceable, because they are uncredited, or credited only to Maurice \u2013 but I still own a cache of amazing photographs that he took of postwar streetlife in France.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e1e4ecf999e268b6fc772f9d36aadbc663cab364\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e1e4ecf999e268b6fc772f9d36aadbc663cab364/286_392_2663_3546/751.jpg\" alt=\"Mollie, Sarah, Albert and Peter Bradshaw, 1965.\" width=\"751\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mollie, Sarah, Albert and Peter Bradshaw, 1965.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy of Peter Bradshaw</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>How thrilled Dad would be as we watched Kind Hearts And Coronets on TV \u2013 particularly the scene in the darkroom, which Louis plans as the site of Henry\u2019s murder. Dad\u2019s darkroom was next to my bedroom: as mysterious and wonderful (and inaccessible) as Aladdin\u2019s cave, full of strange chemicals and occult technical devices. Much later on, when I recorded the audio commentary for the DVD edition with Terence Davies and Matthew Guinness (son of Alec), I was almost speechless with unexpressed emotion. We recorded it four years after Dad died of cancer. It was the nearest I could come to a s\u00e9ance, recalling my dad\u2019s spirit.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ff6e6d80e15aca9efc73faf7257095a60f764f72\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ff6e6d80e15aca9efc73faf7257095a60f764f72/0_0_4370_4326/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A photo Albert took of Montmartre, Paris, 1950.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"990\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A photo Albert took of Montmartre, Paris, 1950.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy of Peter Bradshaw</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What Dad would have thought of one of my favourite films, Raging Bull, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m reasonably sure he never saw Martin Scorsese\u2019s 1980 portrayal of the brutal, emotionally self-harming real-life boxer Jake LaMotta, played by Robert De Niro. I don\u2019t think he would have liked it. The first time I saw it, as a teenager, I got Dad to pick me up from the cinema (the Screen on the Hill in north London, now the Everyman). It was electrifying, yet it wasn\u2019t the boxing but the theatricality and sacrifice in the ring that appealed to me. When I asked Dad if he remembered Jake LaMotta, he replied: \u201cJust a brawler.\u201d He was interested in boxing as a young man and, he told me, often went to fights as a teenager with his friends in Ulster Hall in Belfast. They would smoke (the way they would in the cinema) and laugh at the ref\u2019s laconic dismissal of whingeing fighters: \u201cBox on!\u201d \u2013 a phrase he himself would use in his strong Belfast accent if my sister or I claimed to have been hurt in a squabble.</p> <p>Dad loved the cinema, but hardly ever went. It was a habit that belonged to his youth. He watched movies on TV avidly, and in the 80s he would rent clunky video cassettes or record films off the TV and nerdishly write the films\u2019 titles along the video\u2019s spine. As a boy in Belfast, though, he and his brothers went all the time \u2013 at a time when the city had 40 movie theatres \u2013 often to the Curzon on the Ormeau Road, which was later bombed to smithereens in the Troubles. He was obsessed with the psychological drama Gaslight, directed by George Cukor. \u201cPaula!\u201d he would mysteriously boom from the dinner table to my mum in the kitchen \u2013 impersonating Charles Boyer\u2019s sonorous French voice, with a hint of Belfast. Mum would laugh (Sarah and I were baffled).</p> <p>The strange thing is, Dad was a kind of film-maker. He loved home movies, and had a beautiful Bolex Super 8 cine camera. Yet he scorned people who just showed their raw, silent footage. He had an 8mm film editor and the Bolex technology allowed him to create a sound strip. He filmed my sister and I playing badminton at the caravan park on holiday, and on the beach, having our packed lunch. Later, he put on music, sound effects from the LP borrowed from the public library (\u201cwaves breaking\u201d, superimposed on a shot of the surf, was eerily effective) and added voiceover in a heart-rendingly careful enunciation that made him sound like a Belfast Jacques Cousteau.

      "bodyText": "My parents are dead now, and I think about them both every day. They loved the cinema, and would go all the time as a young couple. My mum had a crush on the young Marlon Brando after seeing him in On The Waterfront and as Mark Antony in Julius Caesar. But it was my dad who was the more voluble about film, if not necessarily the more opinionated. Albert Desmond Bradshaw came to London from Belfast in the 1950s to be a photographer. That was where he met my mum, Mollie, who was working as a secretary. They lived in Highgate, north London and were a hip couple-about-town before my sister, Sarah, and I came along; they then moved to a cottage in Letchmore Heath, near Watford. If I had to cast Dad in a film, I\u2019d suggest Adrian Dunbar \u2013 although Dad was tall and beanpole-thin when we were growing up, with an expression of droll disapproval, which we loved as kids, but found infuriating as stroppy teenagers. He loved watching films on TV with us and, to everyone\u2019s rage, talking over the dialogue when he semi-recognised an actor: \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026! That\u2019s\u2026! Come on, Peter, you know, who is it?\u201d Mum would take us to the cinema as a treat in the holidays: Mary Poppins, The Jungle Book. But it was my dad who got me into watching films. I\u2019ll never forget being about 10 or 11 with Sarah at the dinner table, and asking my parents about a film called Psycho, which I had seen in the TV listings. (It sounded like something I would buy at the shops, like Rolo or Toffo.) Dad launched into a description of the first bit of the film, including Anthony Perkins spying on the naked Janet Leigh in the shower. He even asked me and Sarah if we understood why he should want to be spying on her. My memory is that we nodded, dumbly, but for all we knew of nightmarish sexual obsession and misogynistic violence, Dad could have been describing a tea-making ceremony on Pluto. The discussion ended there. I had no idea what the later, legendary \u201cshower\u201d scene was like until I watched the film as a student. My dad told me to watch the 1949 Ealing classic Kind Hearts And Coronets, directed by Robert Hamer, with Dennis Price as the serial killer Louis, elegantly murdering members of the aristocratic D\u2019Ascoyne family (all played by Alec Guinness) so he can become duke. It seemed to be on TV all the time in the 70s. My dad adored the scene in which young photographer Henry D\u2019Ascoyne and Louis exchange camera chat outside the country pub. (\u201cExcuse me. Isn\u2019t that a Thornton Pickard? \u2013 Yes. Are you a photographer? \u2013 Dabble in it. Got a Sanger Shepherd!\u201d) Before setting up in photography on his own, Dad was assistant to the noted photographer Maurice Broomfield, who recorded postwar industrial Britain and was the father of the documentary film-maker Nick Broomfield. Dad took a lot of photographs for the Financial Times in the 50s, but they are untraceable, because they are uncredited, or credited only to Maurice \u2013 but I still own a cache of amazing photographs that he took of postwar streetlife in France. How thrilled Dad would be as we watched Kind Hearts And Coronets on TV \u2013 particularly the scene in the darkroom, which Louis plans as the site of Henry\u2019s murder. Dad\u2019s darkroom was next to my bedroom: as mysterious and wonderful (and inaccessible) as Aladdin\u2019s cave, full of strange chemicals and occult technical devices. Much later on, when I recorded the audio commentary for the DVD edition with Terence Davies and Matthew Guinness (son of Alec), I was almost speechless with unexpressed emotion. We recorded it four years after Dad died of cancer. It was the nearest I could come to a s\u00e9ance, recalling my dad\u2019s spirit. What Dad would have thought of one of my favourite films, Raging Bull, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m reasonably sure he never saw Martin Scorsese\u2019s 1980 portrayal of the brutal, emotionally self-harming real-life boxer Jake LaMotta, played by Robert De Niro. I don\u2019t think he would have liked it. The first time I saw it, as a teenager, I got Dad to pick me up from the cinema (the Screen on the Hill in north London, now the Everyman). It was electrifying, yet it wasn\u2019t the boxing but the theatricality and sacrifice in the ring that appealed to me. When I asked Dad if he remembered Jake LaMotta, he replied: \u201cJust a brawler.\u201d He was interested in boxing as a young man and, he told me, often went to fights as a teenager with his friends in Ulster Hall in Belfast. They would smoke (the way they would in the cinema) and laugh at the ref\u2019s laconic dismissal of whingeing fighters: \u201cBox on!\u201d \u2013 a phrase he himself would use in his strong Belfast accent if my sister or I claimed to have been hurt in a squabble. Dad loved the cinema, but hardly ever went. It was a habit that belonged to his youth. He watched movies on TV avidly, and in the 80s he would rent clunky video cassettes or record films off the TV and nerdishly write the films\u2019 titles along the video\u2019s spine. As a boy in Belfast, though, he and his brothers went all the time \u2013 at a time when the city had 40 movie theatres \u2013 often to the Curzon on the Ormeau Road, which was later bombed to smithereens in the Troubles. He was obsessed with the psychological drama Gaslight, directed by George Cukor. \u201cPaula!\u201d he would mysteriously boom from the dinner table to my mum in the kitchen \u2013 impersonating Charles Boyer\u2019s sonorous French voice, with a hint of Belfast. Mum would laugh (Sarah and I were baffled). The strange thing is, Dad was a kind of film-maker. He loved home movies, and had a beautiful Bolex Super 8 cine camera. Yet he scorned people who just showed their raw, silent footage. He had an 8mm film editor and the Bolex technology allowed him to create a sound strip. He filmed my sister and I playing badminton at the caravan park on holiday, and on the beach, having our packed lunch. Later, he put on music, sound effects from the LP borrowed from the public library (\u201cwaves breaking\u201d, superimposed on a shot of the surf, was eerily effective) and added voiceover in a heart-rendingly careful enunciation that made him sound like a Belfast Jacques Cousteau. He even had a go at recording speech, taping me with our vintage cassette recorder, and doing a clapperboard-style hand clap in front of the camera to synchronise sound and image. \u201cThanks, Pete!\u201d he would say afterwards, with an air of reserve. As an actor, I think I did not entirely satisfy the director. We still have the Super 8 reels, transferred to DVDs. They play like remembered dreams. But watching them without the stuttering rattle of the projector isn\u2019t as good.

Spain\u2019s meteorological office, Aemet, had forecast torrential downpours of up to 90mm (3.5in) an hour and up to 180mm over 24 hours. It issued red alerts on Friday for the Valencia region and Mallorca, while Almer\u00eda, Murcia, Ibiza and Formentera were on orange alert. Aemet said the isolated depression at high levels causing the heavy rain was expected to affect northern parts of Valencia, Ibiza, south-eastern Aragon and Castilla-La Mancha and parts of eastern Andaluc\u00eda. But it added: \u201cBe aware that small changes in the evolution of the isolated depression at high levels and low-level winds could also bring heavy rains to other areas.\u201d One of the first places to be hit was Ontinyent, a town south of Valencia, where the Clariano River flooded the streets on Wednesday night. Ontinyent\u2019s mayor, Jorge Rodr\u00edguez, said the town had endured its heaviest rainfall on record, with more than 400mm by Thursday afternoon. Muddy water rushed through streets, washing away cars, and almost reached the tops of the front doors of houses along the riverbank. Water also overflowed the Pantano de Almansa dam. A similar weather front hit Madrid and parts of central Spain at the end of August, bringing violent storms, huge drifts of hail and 46.4 litres of rainfall per square metre in some areas.",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all for today, thanks for following along with our live coverage. Some links and key events from the day: A Taliban negotiating team reportedly arrived in Russia just days after Trump said potential peace talks with the group were \u201cdead\u201d. Democratic presidential candidates criticized the lack of debate questions on abortion. Joe Biden said in Houston that he would release his medical records before the first vote of the primaries. The Democratic National Committee announced that the fourth primary debate would take place on 15 October (with the possibility for a second night) in Westerville, Ohio. Trump reportedly referred to Egypt\u2019s authoritarian leader, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, as his \u201cfavorite dictator\u201d during last month\u2019s G-7 summit. Ivanka Trump, the president\u2019s daughter and senior adviser, told donors at a fundraising event last month that she got her moral compass from her father. The climate activist Greta Thunberg held a protest at the White House, where she and other young environmental advocates called for immediate action to address climate change. House Democrats are pushing to have Jeff Sessions testify in the House judiciary committee\u2019s ongoing impeachment probe of Trump. Rights groups sued the Trump administration to stop the release of citizenship data that could be used to benefit the GOP in redistricting. Harvard University received nearly $9m in donations from the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein before his 2008 guilty plea to sex charges. The US government considered using fentanyl for executions, according to a Reuters report out today: The US Department of Justice examined using fentanyl in lethal injections despite the fact that it was an untested use of the powerful, addictive opioid fueling a national crisis of overdose fatalities, the agency reported: The department revealed it had contemplated using the drug in a court filing last month, which has not been previously reported. In the end, it decided against adopting the drug for executions. Attorney General William Barr announced in July his department instead would use pentobarbital, a barbiturate, when it resumes federal executions later this year, ending a de facto moratorium on the punishment put in place by the administration of US President Barack Obama. But the special consideration given to the possibilities of fentanyl, even as federal agents were focused on seizing illegal imports of the synthetic opioid, show how much has changed since the federal government last carried out an execution nearly 20 years ago. Many pharmaceutical companies have since put tight controls on their distribution channels to stop their drugs being used in executions. The president is talking about vaping again: Trump said earlier this week that his administration will propose banning thousands of flavors used in e-cigarettes to combat a recent surge in underage vaping. Here\u2019s what you need to know about the recent concerns about the dangers of vaping, from the Guardian\u2019s health editor: Rights groups have filed a lawsuit to block the Trump administration from collecting government records for the production of data concerning the citizenship status of every person living in the country, NPR is reporting: The lawsuit from Latinx advocacy groups is the first legal challenge to the president\u2019s executive order in July seeking citizenship data. There have been growing concerns that the citizenship records would be used by state redistricting officials to redraw voting districts in a way that gives the GOP advantages in future elections. Here\u2019s the complaint: The case follows a protracted legal battle surrounding Trump\u2019s effort to put a citizenship question on the 2020 Census. There has been ongoing scrutiny today of the Trump administration\u2019s widely criticized effort to effectively end asylum at the US-Mexico border for nearly all migrants: Ken Cuccinelli, the acting head of US Citizenship and Immigration Services, told the AP today that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to allow sweeping regulations to take effect while litigation continued was a big win for the government: \u201cThere\u2019s no underselling it.\u201d The policy is considered the most significant change to asylum policy since its establishment in 1980. More from the AP: The new policy will deny asylum to nearly all migrants arriving at the southern border who aren\u2019t from Mexico because it disallows anyone who passes through another country without first seeking and failing to obtain asylum there. While officials say it\u2019s a crucial effort to help ease strain on the system, it\u2019s also a potentially potent deterrent. The rule falls most heavily on Central Americans, mainly Hondurans and Guatemalans, because they account for most people arrested or stopped at the border. Juan Carlos Perla, 36, said Friday that many asylum seekers from his native El Salvador have returned, including cousins who have stayed with him in a rented two-room house with donated furniture on the distant outskirts of Tijuana. \u201cPeople know that they aren\u2019t going to be allowed in. They\u2019re desperate. Many don\u2019t like it here. Life here isn\u2019t easy,\u201d he said. But it\u2019s also an enormous setback for other asylum seekers, including many Africans, Haitians and Cubans who try to enter the United States via Mexico. Mark Sanford, a South Carolina Republican and former governor, is considering taking legal action to appear on the presidential primary ballot: He said today he was \u201clooking at options\u201d, which could include some kind of legal action against the state Republican party in South Carolina. Sanford announced his bid for president last week. Here\u2019s what he told The State, a South Carolina newspaper: I\u2019m not a lawyer, and I don\u2019t like that particular angle. It\u2019s just never been my default setting \u2014 people see something goes wrong, they sue somebody. I like to look for other ways to resolve issues ... [But] any number of people have called suggesting [legal action]. I\u2019m listening and I would just say, \u2018stay tuned.\u2019\u201d Mike Pence previously argued that being gay was a \u201cchoice\u201d and a \u201clearned behavior\u201d, according to a new report from CNN on the vice president\u2019s anti-LGBT record: CNN\u2019s investigation comes after the White House claimed that the vice president was not \u201canti-gay\u201d last week, citing as proof the fact that he was having lunch with the gay Irish prime minister and his partner: Here\u2019s how Pence previously argued against anti-discrimination proposals: A Pence spokesperson responded to CNN with a statement saying the vice president \u201chas always opposed discrimination in any form and defends the Constitution\u2019s protection of the rights of all Americans regardless of race, sex or religion\u201d. Here\u2019s what Pence has been up to today: Hi all - Sam Levin here in Los Angeles, taking over our live coverage for the rest of the day. House Democrats are pushing to have Jeff Sessions testify in the House judiciary committee\u2019s ongoing impeachment probe of Trump, the Washington Post has just reported: A lawyer for the former attorney general told the Post: I have made clear that Attorney General Sessions will not appear except under compulsion of a congressional subpoena.\u201d Sessions had a famously rocky relationship with the president, who ended up publicly mocking him and then firing him last year. There has been no subpoena issued for Sessions so far, according to the Post\u2019s report. That\u2019s it from me this week. My west coast colleague, Sam Levin, will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: The climate activist Greta Thunberg held a protest at the White House, where she and other young environmental advocates called for immediate action to address climate change. The Democratic National Committee announced that the fourth primary debate would take place on October 15 (with the possibility for a second night) in Westerville, Ohio. Joe Biden pledged that he would release his medical records before primary voting starts. He made the promise just a day after one of his opponents, Juli\u00e1n Castro, appeared to make a crack at the former vice president\u2019s age during last night\u2019s debate. Taliban negotiators have reportedly arrived in Russia just days after Trump declared peace talks with the group to be \u201cdead.\u201d Trump reportedly referred to Egypt\u2019s authoritarian leader, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, as his \u201cfavorite dictator\u201d during last month\u2019s G-7 summit. Ivanka Trump, the president\u2019s daughter and senior adviser, told donors at a fundraising event last month that she got her moral compass from her father. (Yes. Really.) Sam will have more on the news of the day. Have a wonderful weekend, live blog readers. Trump\u2019s appearance at the G-7 summit last month has already been criticized for the president skipping a climate session and making unsubstantiated claims about China reaching out to US officials to discuss trade. And now, a report has emerged that Trump praised Egypt\u2019s authoritarian leader, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, during the trip. The Wall Street Journal reports: Mr. Trump looked over a gathering of American and Egyptian officials and called out in a loud voice: \u2018Where\u2019s my favorite dictator?\u2019 Several people who were in the room at the time said they heard the question. The witnesses said they believed the president made the comment jokingly, but said his question was met by a stunned silence. It couldn\u2019t be determined whether Mr. Sisi was present or heard the remark. ... Even if lighthearted, Mr. Trump\u2019s quip drew attention to an uncomfortable facet of the U.S.-Egypt relationship. ... The White House hasn\u2019t publicly admonished the Egyptian government for its human-rights record. Egypt has defended its actions, saying it is fighting extremists. More from Joe Biden\u2019s second day in Houston: the former vice president mocked those who have grilled him about comments from early in his Senate career. \u201cThis is about the future, this is not about the past,\u201d Biden said at a fundraiser, according to a pool report. \u201cI love it when people say in 1972 you said ...\u201d he added to laughs from the crowd. The comment appeared to reference Linsey Davis\u2019 question from the Democratic debate a day earlier. The ABC News moderator asked Biden about this 1975 quote defending his opposition to federally mandated busing to racially integrate schools: \u201cI don\u2019t feel responsible for the sins of my father and grandfather. I feel responsible for what the situation is today, for the sins of my own generation. And I\u2019ll be damned if I feel responsible to pay for what happened 300 years ago.\u201d The answer Biden offered in response was described by commentators as everything from \u201cbaffling\u201d to \u201cracist.\u201d And for some, it resurfaced a question that has come up repeatedly: has Biden adequately realized the faulty logic in his past ways of thinking about race? For some, the answer is a resounding \u201cno.\u201d From a Time editor-at-large: From an MSNBC analyst and former campaign aide to Hillary Clinton: From a Rolling Stone writer: When asked about releasing his medical records, Joe Biden made this somewhat odd joke to a HuffPost reporter. Joe Biden said in Houston that he would release his medical records before the first vote of the primaries, the Guardian\u2019s Lauren Gambino reports. The former vice president also told reporters a day after the third Democratic debate that he considered questions about his age to be fair in the context of the primary. The comments come one night after Juli\u00e1n Castro appeared to make a crack about Biden\u2019s age by asking him, \u201cAre you forgetting what you said two minutes ago?\u201d But as the blog reported earlier today, some of Biden\u2019s advisers appear to be taking less of a \u201clive and let live\u201d approach to Castro\u2019s criticism. He\u2019s baaaack! Just days after being unceremoniously ousted via tweet from his job as Trump\u2019s national security adviser, John Bolton is resuming his political activities and endorsing Republican lawmakers who share his hawkish worldview. Reuters reports: Bolton retook the reins of the John Bolton PAC and the John Bolton Super Pact, two groups he had headed before joining the White House 17 months ago. ... As part of the resumption of his political action groups, Bolton announced the endorsement of five Republicans running in the November 2020 elections. They are Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas, Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado, Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina, U.S. Representative Adam Kinzinger of Illinois and U.S. Representative Lee Zeldin of New York. Each candidate received $10,000 in contributions from the Bolton groups for a total of $50,000. \u2018The experience that these incumbent members of Congress have provides them with a remarkable understanding and knowledge of the threats we face from international terrorism and rogue regimes such as Iran and North Korea,\u2019 Bolton said in a statement. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has weighed in on the (potential) Senate primary in Massachusetts. One of AOC\u2019s colleagues, Joe Kennedy, is weighing a primary challenge against the incumbent senator, Ed Markey. Kennedy has argued it\u2019s time for a generational change away from the 73-year-old Markey. But that argument may now be undercut with AOC endorsing Markey, who has been a key co-sponsor of the Green New Deal alongside the congresswoman. \u201cEd Markey, I know, is one of the strongest progressives that we have in the United States Senate,\u201d AOC said in an endorsement video. \u201cAnd in a time right now, when we have to have conversations not just about holding this administration accountable but changing the Democratic Party for the future, Ed Markey has a very critical role in making sure that climate change, as well as a bevy of other issues \u2014 health care and beyond \u2014 are critical core issues in how we fight for working people and working families in the United States.\u201d Last night\u2019s Democratic debate included no questions on how the candidates would protect reproductive rights as states like Alabama and Missouri attempt to pass severe restrictions on the procedure. And the candidates took notice: The oversight was particularly notable given that this was the first debate since Kirsten Gillibrand dropped out of the race. The New York senator centered her campaign around issues like abortion and paid family leave. A former campaign adviser to Gillibrand said the lack of abortion questions demonstrated why the race needed a candidate dedicated to the issue. A Taliban negotiating team has reportedly arrived in Russia just days after Trump said potential peace talks with the group were \u201cdead.\u201d The AP reports: Russian state news agency Tass cited the Taliban\u2019s Qatar-based spokesman Suhail Shaheen as saying the delegation had held consultations with Zamir Kabulov, President Vladimir Putin\u2019s envoy for Afghanistan. The visit also was confirmed to The Associated Press by a Taliban official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to reporters. It was the Taliban\u2019s first international visit following the collapse of talks with Washington. The team was being led by Mullah Sher Mohammad Stanikzai. This may well be the most terrifying thing you read on this Friday the 13th. Ivanka Trump, the president\u2019s daughter and senior adviser, told a group of donors last month that she got her moral compass from her father. Politico has more: At a mid-August fundraiser in Jackson Hole, Wyo., Ivanka Trump was asked to name the personality traits she inherited most from her parents. Without much of a pause, Trump told the crowd of roughly 120 high-end donors that her mother gave her an example of how to be a powerful, successful woman. And her father? He passed onto her his moral compass, she said, according to two event attendees. The exchange was part of a broader conversation about Ivanka Trump\u2019s life in Washington and the White House during a swanky retreat organized by Republican House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy in the Wyoming mountains. Her appearance signaled an informal effort by the Trump campaign, family and top aides to woo donors this election cycle by sharing intimate, colorful details about this atypical White House. The New York Times and CNN, who will host the next Democratic debate, announced it will take place on October 15 (with the possibility for a second night) in Westerville, Ohio. Westerville is just outside of Columbus, and the host outlets said the debate would occur on the campus of Otterbein University, a private liberal arts college. The Democratic National Committee did not initially confirm the debate would be two nights, but that seems likely now that 11 candidates appear to have qualified. Other candidates have until Oct. 1 to qualify. The moderators will be CNN anchors Anderson Cooper and Erin Burnett as well as the Times\u2019 national editor, Marc Lacey. The Times noted it will be the first debate the newspaper has planned and hosted in more than a decade. Bianca Pattison and Claire MacQueen, both 14, left in the middle of art class with paint still on their hands to attend the Greta Thunberg\u2019s climate rally at the White House. \u201cI think a lot of the people I\u2019m friends with are quite worried we\u2019re not going to get to experience things our parents got to experience with their kids when we were growing up,\u201d Pattison said, noting trips she\u2019s taken with her family to islands and colder climates. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s not necessarily what will happen to humans but so many animals and ecosystems that are affected by what we\u2019ve done,\u201d MacQueen added. It turns out there are millions of Americans who want to spend more than two hours hearing 10 Democratic candidates discus their campaign platforms, which ... kind of surprises this blogger. The early ratings are in for last night\u2019s Democratic debate, and ABC executives are likely quite happy with them. CNN reports: Thursday night\u2019s debate featuring ten presidential candidates averaged 14 million viewers across ABC and Univision. The debate ratings were head and shoulders above everything else on TV Thursday night. ... With 14 million people watching on TV, the debate ranked behind the record-setting NBC, MSNBC and Telemundo debate in June, but ahead of most other Democratic primary debates in TV history. For comparison\u2019s sake, the third Democratic debate of the 2016 cycle, which also took place on ABC, averaged 8 million total viewers. But it was held on a Saturday night, traditionally a low-rated night for TV viewing, and there is more interest in the primary this time around. As CNN notes, it seems that the switch to a one-night-only event came as a relief to viewers, but that will likely be a short-lived reprieve. With Tom Steyer saying he has qualified for the fourth debate, the next match will almost certainly be spread across two nights. Meanwhile, reactions are still pouring in to last night\u2019s Democratic debate. In particular, there has been a lot of discussion around Juli\u00e1n Castro\u2019s repeated swipes at Joe Biden. At one point during the debate, Castro accused Biden of changing his position on healthcare from what he had told the Houston audience just moments earlier. \u201cAre you forgetting what you said two minutes ago?\u201d Castro repeatedly asked Biden. The question was (pretty reasonably) read by many as a criticism of Biden\u2019s age and propensity for gaffes, an interpretation that Castro denied after the debate. But the former vice president\u2019s camp appears to have knives out for Castro now, as demonstrated by this comment from a senior Biden adviser. Castro and Biden have both already qualified for the next debate in Ohio, but they may not share the stage again. Tom Steyer has said he has qualified for the debate, likely making the event a two-night affair. But if the pair do end up on the same stage, Biden can be expected to target Castro. The former veep did exactly that to Kamala Harris in the second debate after she called out his past opposition to busing in their first face-off. The blog is watching news on multiple fronts, including Greta Thunberg\u2019s climate protest at the White House and the House judiciary committee demanding documents from tech giants to determine whether their market dominance violates anti-trust law. On the latter front, the top Republican on the House judiciary committee, Doug Collins, released a statement about the panel\u2019s document request. \u201cThe Judiciary Committee is investigating the relationship between big tech and market competition,\u201d Collins said. \u201cWe made it clear when we launched this bipartisan investigation that we plan to get all the facts we need to diagnose the problems in the digital marketplace. Today\u2019s document requests are an important milestone in this investigation as we work to obtain the information that our Members need to make this determination.\u201d Collins\u2019 statement is noteworthy for its sense of cooperation with the panel\u2019s Democrats. The House judiciary committee has been pursuing multiple lines of investigation into Trump, and Collins has repeatedly issued statements bashing the panel\u2019s chairman, Jerry Nadler. But investigating tech giants appears to be one area of consensus for the committee. Thunberg briefly took the megaphone at the gathering, to enthusiastic cheers. She had seemed deliberately to keep to the fringes of the event, chanting rather shyly, and then saying she wouldn\u2019t give a speech because previous speakers \u201chave already said everything.\u201d But she added: \u201cI just want to say I\u2019m so incredibly grateful for every single one of you, I\u2019m so proud of you, who have come here and I, it\u2019s a lot of people ... This is overwhelming. Just never give up, we will continue and see you next week on September 20th,\u201d referring to the planned global climate strike. It\u2019s Friday 13th so who knows what surprises may still be in store for US politics watchers this afternoon? I\u2019m handing over to the Guardian US politics blogger-in-chief, Joanie Greve, now after her busy night with the team covering the Dem debate in Houston, Texas. Here are the main topics that have been in play this morning: Greta Thunberg is leading a climate crisis protest at the White House, along with other youth activists. She\u2019s expected to speak to the crowd shortly. The gun control issue had a significant role at the Democratic debate in Houston last night and rumbled on overnight, with online nastiness directed at Beto. The House judiciary committee made a bipartisan demand for internal emails and other sensitive documentation from tech giants Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple, with an October deadline for the material to be handed over to the congressional anti-trust probe. \u201cMass extinction\u201d Climate protesters near the White House, on a cloudy day, are performing an 11-minute \u201cmass extinction\u201d event or \u201cdie-in\u201d. The Guardian\u2019s global environment editor, Jonathan Watts, last year pointed out the grave new warning from the world\u2019s leading experts - so 2030 is a serious deadline. He wrote in October, 2018, hence the time left now being 11 years, not 12: \u201cThe world\u2019s leading climate scientists have warned there is only a dozen years for global warming to be kept to a maximum of 1.5C, beyond which even half a degree will significantly worsen the risks of drought, floods, extreme heat and poverty for hundreds of millions of people. The authors of the landmark report by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) say urgent and unprecedented changes are needed to reach the target, which they say is affordable and feasible although it lies at the most ambitious end of the Paris agreement pledge to keep temperatures between 1.5C and 2C.\u201d Fridays for Future Here\u2019s Greta Thunberg\u2019s pinned tweet explaining her school strike. Seizing the future A recap on an editorial the Guardian published this spring on Greta Thunberg\u2019s climate campaign and her Fridays for Future strike campaign. Teen protest leader Greta Thunberg has arrived at the White House youth demonstration against inaction on the climate crisis. The Guardian\u2019s Emily Holden, who is at the event in Washington, reports that the Swedish 16-year-old just turned up moments ago. Thunberg generally doesn\u2019t seek the limelight, it finds her. In \u201ccelebrity\u201d terms, that is. Of course she is very keen to draw the world\u2019s attention to global heating. Right now, she is very quietly chanting \u201chey hey ho ho climate change has got to go\u201d with the other teens on the scene. More Americans recognize the climate emergency A growing number of Americans describe climate change as a crisis, and two-thirds say Donald Trump is doing too little to tackle the problem, the Washington Post reports today. The results, from a poll conducted by The Washington Post and the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF), \u201cpoint to a growing disconnect between Americans worried about the warming planet and Trump administration officials, who have aggressively scaled back Obama-era environmental regulations and relinquished the nation\u2019s role as a global leader in pushing for climate action,\u201d the daily writes. The poll finds that a strong majority of Americans \u2014 about 8 in 10 \u2014 say that human activity is fueling climate change, and roughly half believe action is urgently needed within the next decade if humanity is to avert its worst effects. Nearly 4 in 10 now say climate change is a \u201ccrisis,\u201d up from less than a quarter five years ago. Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg is taking her Friday strike to the White House, rallying with other youth protestors, the Guardian\u2019s environment reporter Emily Holden writes. Dozens of advocates calling for rapid government action to limit heat-trapping pollution were already gathering ahead of her expected 11 am arrival. \u201cNo more coal, no more oil, keep your carbon in the soil,\u201d the group of mostly preteens and teenagers changed On Wednesday, Thunberg will testify before lawmakers at the US Capitol and then join young Americans who are suing the US government over the crisis from the steps of the Supreme Court. Thunberg, who sailed to the US to avoid the carbon footprint of flying, will participate in a global strike next Friday. It is partly inspired by her decision to spend Fridays protesting outside the Swedish parliament. Thousand of events around the world are planned. The United Nations will be meeting in New York and discussing the climate crisis, and activists will target the global fossil fuel CEOs conference taking place the same day. More fallout from last night\u2019s debate includes online debate, under #BoycottABC, about ABC\u2019s decision to air an ad burning a picture of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and equating socialism to dictatorship. You can watch the ad here. Another interesting clip cited on Twitter is one of author and social critic Noam Chomsky, analyzing how \u201csocialism\u201d has been \u201cevacuated of content\u201d. A constitutional case against President Trump is moving forward. The \u201cemoluments\u201d clause of the Constitution prevents the president from accepting payments from foreign governments, and also from the federal government (except his salary). The case was dismissed by a district court, a decision overturned today. Here is the full text of the decision. Going back to our earlier promise to include some of what 2020 Democratic presidential candidates had to say after the debate, here is Amy Klobuchar on CNN this morning. I may not be the loudest voice in the room, but we already have that in the White House. Maybe people want something different and that\u2019s the case I made [last night].\u201d In response to Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s stance, one Texas representative said, \u201cMy AR-15 is ready for you\u201d. Twitter removed the comment minutes later, citing it as a threat of violence. Trump\u2019s likely gun-lobby-approved legislation is in stark contrast to comments by former Texas Congressman and El Paso-native Beto O\u2019Rourke. On the debate stage, O\u2019Rourke told Americans, \u201cHell yes, we\u2019re gonna take your AR-15, your AK-47, and we\u2019re not going to allow it to be used against your fellow Americans anymore.\u201d The line has been widely cited as one of the most memorable of the evening. The American gun lobby has been working an \u201call-of-the-above\u201d lobbying strategy to influence the package of gun control measures Trump is expected to propose in the near future. Republicans have been under pressure since two mass shootings took place in the same weekend in August, in El Paso, Texas and Dayton, Ohio. Here is more from Politico: In addition to possible changes to the background check system, Trump will likely include gun lobby-approved offerings meant to address violent video games and mental health treatment, according to several people familiar with the situation. The red flag bill \u2014 a so-called compromise proposal pushed by the president\u2019s ally, Sen. Lindsey Graham, but opposed by the gun industry \u2014 may not make the cut. On Thursday night, Trump uttered the words the gun lobby wanted to hear. \u201cDemocrats want to confiscate guns from law-abiding Americans,\u201d he told House Republicans at their retreat. \u201cRepublicans will always uphold the fundamental right to keep and bear arms.\u201d He received a standing ovation. Spotlight on tech giants gets brighter and hotter The details of this news will continue to flow out this morning, after a bipartisan congressional demand for internal documents from Amazon, Facebook, Google and Apple as part of an anti-trust probe. The companies did not immediately return a request for comment, Reuters reports. The demand comes days after the Texas attorney general led a group of 50 attorneys general from US states and territories in a probe on whether Google abuses its market power in advertising. The US Justice Department said in July it is investigating \u201cwhether and how\u201d large tech companies in \u201csearch, social media, and some retail services online\u201d are engaging in anticompetitive behavior, an apparent reference to the same companies named by the House panel on Friday. Channel reopens after Greenpeace climate protest It remains to be seen to what extent blocking a shipping channel opens a dialogue channel. The climate crisis and the environment is top of many people\u2019s agendas, to be sure, even if it wasn\u2019t very high up the list at the Democratic debate in Houston last night. But the day after Greenpeace USA protesters pretty much blocked a Texas coastal shipping lane, the waterway is back in action today - point made. The Houston Ship Channel has reopened for vessel traffic, the US Coast Guard said today, after the last of 11 protesters who had disrupted traffic by dangling on ropes above the key energy-export waterway was removed by police earlier in the morning, Reuters writes. A large portion of the channel was closed when the demonstrators attached themselves and banners to a bridge over the waterway to bring attention to climate change during the debate in Houston. Police arrested 23, with the last protester removed about 1AM local time by Harris County Sheriff\u2019s Office, said Travis Nichols, a Greenpeace spokesman. The 23 were taken to the Harris County jail in Houston and are expected to appear in court today, he said. The waterway stretches 53 miles from its entrance in the Gulf of Mexico to the Port of Houston. The area affected is home to five major oil refineries as well as chemical and oil-export terminals. A House of Representatives committee moments ago demanded internal emails and other sensitive company records from four technology giants as it seeks evidence of anticompetitive behavior. A bipartisan group of lawmakers on the House judiciary committee requested Amazon, Facebook, Apple, and Alphabet, the owner of Google, provide the documents by 14 October, Reuters reports. Good Friday the 13th morning, everyone, some of you may be bleary eyed from staying up to watch the post-match analysis and social media rhythms after last night\u2019s Democratic debate among the top 10 contenders for the 2020 nomination. But, hey, wake up and smell the smoothie coz Greta\u2019s in town, some Dem candidates are already on TV and the Trump administration is up to mischief. Here\u2019s what\u2019s afoot so far today: Swedish teen climate campaigner Greta Thunberg is leading a protest outside the White House this morning. She and other youth activists will demand action from the US to address the climate crisis, one week before global climate strikes on 20 September. Some Democratic candidates from the debate last night have already been on the television before the sun is even up in Texas. Some are standing firm on controversial topics, others are catching flak. Find out more after the break. While the Dem debate was getting underway, Donald Trump was giving a reportedly rambling speech at the House Republican \u201cretreat\u201d in Baltimore \u2013 the city he called a rat- and rodent-infested mess in the summer. The president promised a \u201ctax cut for the middle income people that is going to be very, very inspirational.\u201d A report has emerged that a 12-year-old girl who evacuated from the Bahamas when Hurricane Dorian hit, and arrived in Florida, was detained in US government custody instead of being allowed to be with an aunt or her godmother, who were at hand.",
