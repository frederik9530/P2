      "bodyText": "Stalkers, domestic abusers and paedophiles face having their jail sentences increased if victims or members of the public complain their punishment is too lenient as the government continues to roll out its tough-on-crime agenda. The unduly lenient scheme (ULS) gives anyone the power to ask the attorney general to consider referring a sentence to the court of appeal for reconsideration \u2013 where it could then be increased if deemed unduly lenient. Under plans confirmed on Tuesday, the scheme will be extended to 14 new offences \u2013 including a range of child sexual abuse crimes, stalking and the domestic abuse charge of controlling or coercive behaviour. Murder, robbery and a range of terror offences are already covered by the scheme, which saw a dip in use last year. In 2018, of the 140 offenders referred to the courts by the scheme, 99 offenders had their sentences increased. This compared to 173 referrals in 2017, which led to an increase in the sentences of 137 offenders. Robert Buckland QC, the justice secretary, said: \u201cSentences are decided by our independent judiciary based on the facts before them, but it is absolutely right that victims have a voice in the system when punishments don\u2019t appear to fit the crime.\u201d The move to expand the scheme comes at a time of debate over the pressures of overcrowding on the prison estate, with Boris Johnson pledging to create an extra 10,000 prison places. Since becoming prime minister, Johnson and his government have attempted to make a hardline approach to criminal justice a central plank of their domestic agenda \u2013 a move denounced as populist by critics. Johnson and his cabinet have made a wave of a justice-focused announcements, including on new prison places, tougher sentencing, increased use of stop and search and more police officers on the streets. The following offences have been added to the ULS: Abuse of position of trust: sexual activity with a child (section 16 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003). Abuse of position of trust: causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity (section 17, Sexual Offences Act 2003). Abuse of position of trust: sexual activity in the presence of a child (section 18, Sexual Offences Act 2003). Abuse of position of trust: causing a child to watch a sexual act (section 19, Sexual Offences Act 2003). Inciting a child family member to engage in sexual activity (section 26, Sexual Offences Act 2003). Sexual activity with a person with a mental disorder impeding choice (section 30, Sexual Offences Act 2003). Causing or inciting a person with a mental disorder impeding choice to engage in sexual activity (section 31, Sexual Offences Act 2003). Engaging in sexual activity in the presence of a person with a mental disorder impeding choice (section 32, Sexual Offences Act 2003). Causing a person with a mental disorder impeding choice to watch a sexual act (section 33, Sexual Offences Act 2003). Possession of an indecent photograph of a child (section 160, Criminal Justice Act 1988). Taking, possessing, distributing or publishing indecent photographs of children (section 1, Protection of Children Act 1978). Harassment: putting people in fear of violence (section 4, Protection from Harassment Act 1997). Stalking involving fear of violence or serious alarm or distress (section 4A, Protection from Harassment Act 1997). Controlling or coercive behaviour in an intimate or family relationship (section 76, Serious Crime Act 2015).",

On the opposite flank Trent Alexander-Arnold faces competition from Joe Gomez at right-back and, up against Insigne, a challenge he compares to dealing with Eden Hazard. \u201cHe\u2019s that type of player who is tricky to get hold of and mark,\u201d said the Liverpool defender. \u201cReally strong, fast and quite agile.\u201d Alexander-Arnold admits Liverpool have become a prized target for Champions League rivals this season and will relish the responsibility. He said: \u201cA lot of the players we have are world-class players. They know what it takes to win things, what it takes to be successful, so I\u2019m pretty sure we\u2019ll be able to embrace that as a team. I think we have so far this season in the league. \u201cA lot of teams will want to beat us and play different ways and we know that\u2019s going to be the test for us. We need to be ready for all types of tests.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Paul Doyle has filed his report. Read it here! And that\u2019ll do for tonight. Thanks for your company, everyone, and speak to you again soon! Declan Rice has a chat, now: \u201cTo be honest I think we\u2019re very happy with the point. It was a bit too end to end in the first half. We dug in with 10 men, played really well and didn\u2019t try and sit back, we created chances. We were a bit slow out of the blocks in the first half, but second half I thought we were excellent.\u201d Jack Grealish has a word or two though: \u201cAll the lads are devastated, it feels a bit like a loss in there especially when they went down to 10 men. we had the better chances but couldn\u2019t get one away. When they went down to 10 men we probably got worse, gave away sloppy passes myself included. We weren\u2019t deadly enough in front of goal and tried to force things.\u201d On Mings vs El Ghazi: \u201cIt was just handbags, they shook hands in the dressing room and we said that can\u2019t be happening on the pitch. Emotions were running high, we were so desperate to win the game but that happens. Once we got into the dressing room it was all squashed.\u201d Carragher and Neville weren\u2019t impressed at all with that; it\u2019s getting a panning in the studio. I was expecting more, too, I must say. It was just pretty loose and lacking in quality. Bad decisions all over. A reasonable tempo but little more. Mings and Haller enjoyed a good old battle (as did Mings and El Ghazi for that matter!) but it\u2019s a game we won\u2019t be talking about for much longer. That\u2019s it! A strange old game, lively without seeing many chances, and a fair result. Villa wasted 20 minutes or so between the 68th and 88th minutes, for my money, before going for the 10 men a little too late. West Ham spurn a chance to go third but did not play badly today. There just wasn\u2019t a lot of quality in the final third out there from anyone, anywhere. 90+3 min: Now West Ham seek a penalty, Fredericks making a lung-busting run across Mings on the break and going down ... but the officials remain steely-faced. Then Fornals is granted a great shooting chance on the right of the box by Rice, but wrongly opts to pass across the box! Should have had a go! 90+2 min: Ogbonna heads out for a corner, rather closer to his own goal than he might have liked. West Ham bring on Balbuena for Noble, and he has some defending to do. The ball runs loose from the flag kick and for a moment it seems Wesley is going to convert on the corner of the six-yard box, but over he goes! There are cries for a penalty but it looks as if he was just off balance. 90+1 min: There\u2019ll be just the three added minutes here. 89 min: Wesley shoots harmlessly at Fabianski but Villa have at long last perked up a tad. 88 min: Big chance for Grealish! That was it, surely! Villa finally make something happen, Douglas Luiz whipping a ball over for Grealish, who nobody has tracked. The height is awkward but he\u2019s alone in front of goal and, stretching out a leg, can only dab the ball into the ground and wide! 86 min: West Ham break in numbers and Fornals finds Noble in space on the edge of the area, but Villa get back and block his shot. 85 min: Now Guilbert fells Noble in another good area on the left. West Ham have completely controlled this since Masuaku\u2019s dismissal, weird though it may sound. Yet again, Villa deal with the set-piece. Mings heads it away, he\u2019s been excellent again today. One more change for Villa now as Guilbert, the defender, is replaced by forward Keinan Davis. 83 min: Douglas Luiz concedes a daft free-kick after Haller gets away from Mings. The striker wasn\u2019t going to be fast enough to get in on goal there and had little support. Can West Ham create something here? Nope; Grealish hooks it away. 81 min: Villa deal with the corner but at this moment they\u2019re not dealing with much else. Douglas Luiz comes on for Nakamba, who struggled initially before really powering on, as Dean Smith looks to address that. 80 min: Still hardly seen a thing of consequence from Villa since they went a man up. They are hurrying things and looking very loose. And, put it this way, they don\u2019t look the likelier winners. Fornals has a shot deflected wide as West Ham keep pushing ... 77 min: Mings is booked for clearing out Haller with an arm. It\u2019s been a good old fashioned battle, that. 76 min: Guilbert does well not to concede a corner as Zabaleta looks to get in behind. But West Ham have probably looked a mite better than Villa since losing a man. 73 min: Mings blocks crucially from Haller after the big striker turns and shoots. West Ham still look as if they\u2019ll attack. 73 min: I wonder if Villa have the craft to unpick 10 men now, though. I know Elmohamady won the red card straight after coming on but Jota is far more a man who can prise a defence open. I\u2019m with Jacob on both. 69 min: Anderson is sacrificed for Zabaleta, unsurprisingly, and a goalless draw is starting to look exceptionally likely unless Villa really crank it up. Now then! Masuaku, already booked, clips Elmohamady with his knee as the sub looks to go past him, and Mike Dean is in no doubt \u2013 two yellows make a red! I really do wonder if a final warning might have been more appropriate there, it wasn\u2019t a bad one. Instant impact from Elmohamady, in a way, and what will this do to the game? 66 min: Now a Villa change, Elmohamady replacing Jota. Not one that\u2019ll set the pulses racing, with all due respect. 64 min: It\u2019s pretty open, this, but neither side quite has that extra shot of quality in the final third at the moment. 62 min: Yarmolenko, fairly quiet today and not efficient on the ball, is replaced by Pablo Fornals. 60 min: Nakamba, who has got up to the pace now, does well to shepherd Masuaku out and win a goal kick. 58 min: Straight down the other end and McGinn finds El Ghazi with a lovely lofted ball. He controls well and flashes in a shot that Fabianski dives onto. Not easy to call a winner here. 56 min: Now a spell of pressure from West Ham and Grealish throws himself in the way of a Rice piledriver quite superbly, blocking with his ankle. 54 min: Lots of knocks out there today. It\u2019s been very well contested. Engels goes off for some treatment after what looked like an inadvertent arm in the face; seems he\u2019ll be OK. 52 min: Fabianski beats away a Grealish cross and then McGinn daisycuts one not far wide at all, making the keeper scamper nervously. 51 min: Heaton has to dive to save a header from his own player, Taylor, after some messy Villa defending \u2013 and pretty messy West Ham attacking, in fairness. 50 min: McGinn seems to go over the ball on Haller, both players taking a blow, and nothing bar a couple of bruises results. 49 min: \u201cCan we call tonight\u2019s game The David Cameron Derby?\u201d asks Alun Williams. I did that at the very top of the show, Alun, before going off for a very long cry. 48 min: Guilbert catches Anderson as he beats him to a header, I think making contact with his hip area, but the West Ham schemer soldiers on. Villa kick off. Simon Cole writes very fairly: \u201cAfter that first half incident between El Ghazi and Fabianski the issue about head injury assessment needs to be highlighted. Football needs to allow a head injury replacement whilst a player goes through a return to pitch protocol for head injuries. Until then football is in the dark ages.\u201d \u201cI\u2019d like to see Tyrone Mings play for Salzburg, Leipzig or New York at some point in his career, and then transfer on a free to somewhere else. Just so I can read the inevitable announcement \u2018Red Bull gives you Mings\u2019,\u201d jokes Peter Oh. Obviously the \u201cRB\u201d in Leipzig actually means RasenBallsport and has nothing whatsoever to do with energy drinks. And more from Jimmy McManners: \u201cI vote for Peter Ndlovu just because whenever he scored the commentator would have to belt out his name, making it impossible not to sound like Barry White shouting \u2018Aaand Looove\u2019. \u201cI see that Marvelous is getting a statue, according to this reputable source.\u201d Some Zimbabwean chat from Jon Millard: \u201cNot a Premiership player, but my all time favourite Zimbabwean, indeed my favourite ever footballer, is Andy \u201cAndy Mac\u201d McMillan of York City. He was forced out of York City at the age of only 31, denied the chance to get to 500 appearances for York.\u201d We retire with honours even for 15 minutes. 45+1 min: Oh, best moment yet! McGinn hits a snap shot on the edge of the box that snicks off Wesley and heads for the corner ... until Fabianski gets down and saves it superbly! 44 min: It\u2019s been a watchable half without being especially eventful. Goalless is about right, if it ends that way. Wesley and Haller have had headed chances, Anderson too actually, but that\u2019s about your lot. How can we forget this? 41 min: El Ghazi is fine. Well, fine enough. That could have been worse. 40 min: Jota skips inside and clips a lovely ball for El Ghazi to run onto ... but Fabianski has to get there first and makes sure he does, punching clear and absolutely cleaning El Ghazi out in the process. It\u2019s not a foul but it looks very painful indeed. 38 min: Should probably be 1-0 to West Ham, Masuaku doing superbly down the left before standing up a fine cross for Anderson who, running off El Ghazi, sees a free header blocked. Then El Ghazi is quite lucky not to concede a penalty as he dangles out a leg on Noble before Villa clear. 36 min: Mings diverts a tricky cross wide of his own goal and then gets finger-pointingly furious at El Ghazi, his teammate, for not tracking his runner properly. In the meantime Dean is checking something on the VAR ... seemingly the clash between El Ghazi and Mings as things got a bit heated! They did go head to head there. Nothing comes either of that or of Anderson\u2019s corner. 34 min: McGinn fairly thumps one from 35 yards but Fabianski is stationed to field it. Not a lot in this one at the moment. 33 min: Villa have definitely livened up again here, and Guilbert heads at Fabianski only to be ruled offside. 31 min: Villa win a corner, take it short and then win another promising left-sided free-kick. Grealish really fizzed that last one in. This time it goes short to him and eventually any sort of chance goes begging. Noble was the third player to be booked a moment or two back, by the way. 28 min: Now Grealish is booked after being a touch late on Anderson. A bit harsh, it was his first foul of the game. 27 min: Rice\u2019s shot deflects wide and West Ham earn another corner. Nakamba is finding life a little tough in that midfield currently as West Ham pass the ball around quickly. Anderson\u2019s corner eventually results in a comical slash over from Masuaku. 25 min: After some treatment, Guilbert is fine. We toddle onwards. 23 min: Guilbert goes down in a heap after a collision with Masuaku, which earns the West Ham man a yellow. Play continues but Villa lose possession and Felipe Anderson looks inclined to continue a promising situation on the counter until the potential for mass disorder, should it have come to anything, overwhelms him and he knocks the ball out. 21 min: Now West Ham\u2019s best chance yet, with a sleek counter seeing Anderson cross from the left for Haller, who gets up and across Mings but can\u2019t quite direct his header on target. 20 min: The ball strikes Mike Dean, who we know never likes getting involved in things, and Villa are awarded an uncontested drop ball under one of the summer\u2019s new rules. 19 min: A quiet spell. Both teams do seem bright here though, and Ogbonna does well to thwart McGinn on the left side of the area. 15 min: West Ham look neat and deft, that is until Yarmolenko unleashes his hammer of a left foot and wobbles an effort miles wide from range. 13 min: Close! Grealish makes an overlap \u2013 well, an underlap really \u2013 down the right and fires a brilliant ball in for Wesley, and it seems any touch will put the ball in, but it pings off the striker\u2019s head and somehow flies high &amp; wide! Our man at the game has also spied Gazza S. 11 min: Will he see a goal now? El Ghazi is felled by Diop out on the left and not too far outside the penalty area. Villa send up the cavalry. Grealish whips it in dangerously and Fabianski clutches it very well. 9 min: Gareth Southgate is here. He\u2019s watching a match that has so far flickered interestingly enough. 7 min: I can confirm that West Ham have just played a long goal kick, which landed plum on the head of Haller and then, via Yarmolenko, to Noble. His thud from distance was straight at Heaton. 5 min: Lovely move from West Ham, who keep possession for a long time before Fredericks skips free on the right. Haller touches his centre back for Yarmolenko but the Ukrainian\u2019s shot is deflected behind. The corner is cleared. Useful litmus test tonight. 2 min: Early promise that we could see an open game. Rice has to hold firm to stop McGinn bundling through and getting a shot on goal. We are underway ... West Ham kick us off and shoot right to left. Ok, the teams are strolling out at Villa Park \u2013 kick-off is around four minutes away I reckon ... It\u2019s Manuel Pellegrini\u2019s 66th birthday! Happy birthday, Manuel! \u201cI want three points instead of the cake,\u201d he says. It\u2019s a wonder he ever gave Yaya Toure a game at Man City. On the subject of Nakamba, who\u2019s your favourite Premier League old boy from Zimbabwe? Pick from (1) Bruce Grobbelaar (2) Peter Ndlovu and (3) Benjani, and show your working. More reading for thine eyes before we get going. Here\u2019s Will Unwin on the power battle inside Sheffield United, another newly-promoted side: A cracker in the Women\u2019s Super League will be unfolding very soon. It\u2019s Manchester United v Arsenal, and guiding you through that one will be our very own Niall McVeigh: On me telly Gary Neville is quite rightly taking us through Norwich\u2019s brilliant building from the back at the weekend. When it works, it\u2019s sensational \u2013 no doubt about that at all. Dean Smith on Nakamba: \u201cDouglas Luiz has been playing for Brazil and it tires people out going back and forth. Marvelous has been training very well.\u201d I fancy both teams to make use of a handy outball \u2013 Wesley and Haller both know how to lead a line \u2013 if passing out from the back isn\u2019t possible. You don\u2019t *have* to play out from the keeper, much as it can be lovely! Do we think that in five years\u2019 time there\u2019ll have been a massive kick back and proper Crazy Gang up-and-unders will be a la mode? Villa give a debut to Marvelous Nakamba, the absolutely spiffing Zimbabwe midfielder. The Hammers are unchanged. Aston Villa: Heaton, Guilbert, Engels, Mings, Taylor, Grealish, Nakamba, McGinn, Jota, Wesley, El Ghazi. Subs: Douglas Luiz, Lansbury, Steer, Hourihane, Konsa, Elmohamady, Davis. West Ham: Fabianski, Fredericks, Diop, Ogbonna, Masuaku, Noble, Rice, Yarmolenko, Lanzini, Felipe Anderson, Haller. Subs: Balbuena, Zabaleta, Snodgrass, Roberto, Fornals, Wilshere, Ajeti. Referee: Mike Dean It\u2019s the claret and blue derby. Or should that be the David Cameron derby? Given that he\u2019s everywhere you look at the moment we don\u2019t really need to go there though. Let\u2019s settle on this: it should be a rattling good game to round off a distinctly curious Premier League weekend. West Ham have been fun so far. Fun, fun, fun, with some in-form strikers and a free-flowing forward line. Villa have impressed, too, in beating Everton and were mightily unlucky not to draw in that controversial clash at Crystal Palace. So this one looks as if it will be very close to call. But the carrot for Manuel Pellegrini\u2019s side tonight is huge \u2013 if they take the three points, they\u2019ll go third in the early-season table.

      "bodyText": "Finally, the oil future market has closed with the sharpest jump in prices on record. At least for Brent crude, which ended the day up 14.6% at $69.02 - the biggest percentage gain in record. US crude oil also soared, ending the day 14.7% higher at $62.90. The attack in Saudi Arabia sent traders scrambling to buy oil contracts, especially with Donald Trump warning that America is ready for war. Economists are fearing weeks of disruption, possibly running into months, if Saudi can\u2019t get the Abqaiq facility back online soon -- or if the tensions between the US and Iran escalate. As Saul Kavonic, an energy analyst at Credit Suisse, put it: We have never seen a supply disruption and price response like this in the oil market. Political-risk premiums are now back on the oil-market agenda. That\u2019s all for tonight! Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Over at the White House, Donald Trump has said he hopes to avoid conflict in the Middle East: Here\u2019s a neat explanation of how a higher oil price could lead to faster inflation and slower global growth: The world urgently needs competent leadership before the crisis in the Middle East boils over, writes foreign affairs commentator Simon Tisdall. He\u2019s particularly critical of the US administration, whose tearing-up of the Iran nuclear deal has escalated tensions in the region, and pushed Tehran into a corner: Warning bells, akin to those used to alert fog-bound mariners steering towards rocks, have been ringing out for months. They have mostly been ignored. The daunting bill for multiple acts of political insouciance, measured in lives and petrodollars, is now coming due. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares has closed 46 points lower at 7,321 points, a drop of 0.6%. Stocks wilted in the face of concerns that escalating tensions in the Middle East will hurt global growth, and that higher oil prices will curb consumer spending on other item. Financial group Prudential led the fallers, down 3.3%, on fears of lower growth in its Asia-Pacific markets. IAG, British Airways\u2019 parent company, dropped by 2.7%. Cruise firm Carnival, which is also vulnerable to recession worries (and also uses plenty of oil!) lost 2.2%. Oil companies, though, ended the day at the top - BP jumped by 4% and Royal Dutch Shell gained 2% My colleagues Richard Partington and Jillian Ambrose have written about today\u2019s oil spike: The Saudi oil attacks have triggered the steepest petroleum market price surge in 30 years and stoked fears for the global economy. The attacks on Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil infrastructure led to the biggest jump in global prices since 1988 by wiping out 5.7m barrels of production a day \u2013 5% of the world\u2019s oil supply. The price of Brent crude surged by more than $12 (\u00a39.60) a barrel within seconds as trading began in London, quickly breaching the $70 a barrel mark. The energy price shock reverberated through global markets, driving up shares in energy companies on the prospect of higher profits, while stock exchanges across Europe plunged into the red as investors took fright over rising geopolitical tensions. Oil market analysts claim prices could surge towards $100 a barrel in the coming weeks if Middle East tensions reignite disruption in the strait of Hormuz, a key transit route for the world\u2019s oil tankers. A Middle East energy crisis could be a boon for US shale producers, but threatens to tip the stumbling global economy into a major recession by stemming supply to Asian economies. Donald Trump said the US was \u201clocked and loaded\u201d to retaliate and could authorise the release of US oil reserves to help balance the market. But energy experts cast doubt on whether US fracking companies would be able to fill the gap left by Saudi oil production plants. Bj\u00f8rnar Tonhaugen, the head of oil markets at Rystad Energy, said the world was \u201cnot even close\u201d to being able to replace Saudi exports. Brent crude is pushing higher.... now up 11.5% today at $67.03 per barrel. Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, says traders are focusing on how quickly supply can return to normal at the Saudi Aramco plant. Geopolitical risk in the Middle East is nothing new. However, what we are seeing is a physical disruption to supply, as the attacks over the weekend cut half the county\u2019s oil production. This equates to a disruption on as much as 5% of global oil production. We can expect oil prices to remain elevated whilst production is disrupted, some reports suggest that this could be weeks. As supply returns, we can expect the price of oil to start declining back towards $62, should geopolitical risks ease as well. However, with the US \u201clocked and loaded\u201d awaiting signs from Saudi Arabia that Iran was involved, tensions in the middle east could get worse before they get better. Under these circumstances the price of oil could remain elevated for some time yet. Data provider Refinitiv has spotted that Saudi Arabia has been scrambling supertankers to export oil, to cover the shortfall from the Abqaiq attacks. It says: Tracking data shows at least 8 VLCC\u2019s [very large crude carriers] that are currently loading in Juaymah and Ras Tanura, with another VLCC heading to berth at one of the Juaymah SBM offshore mooring systems Refinitiv ship tracking data showing at least 11 ships currently waiting to load from Ras Tanura / Juaymah as disruption has resulted in a pile up of VLCCs Saudi Arabia needing to draw out of reserves to meet commitments but low stocks will add to pressure A reminder: here\u2019s our latest news story on the Saudi attacks: US diplomat Richard Haass, who chairs the Council on Foreign Relations think tank, has tweeted about the Saudi attacks: Over in New York, shares in oil companies have jumped, but airlines are sliding. Exxon Mobile (+1.4%) and Chevron (+1.3%) are leading the risers on the Dow Jones industrial average. Shale oil producers are also rallying: American Airlines is dragging the market down though, down 5%, with Delta Air down 2.7%. Big-name consumer stocks including American Express (-1.8%), Procter &amp; Gamble (-1.6%) and Walt Disney (-1.2%) are also under pressure. At over $66 per barrel, up 10% today, Brent crude is on track for its biggest one-day surge since the Gulf War in January 1991. The FT\u2019s Adam Samson has dug into the archives.... Here\u2019s Reuters take on the latest news from Saudi Arabia: The Saudi-led military coalition battling Yemen\u2019s Houthi movement said on Monday that the attack on Saudi oil plants was carried out by Iranian weapons and did not originate from Yemen according to preliminary findings. Coalition spokesman Colonel Turki al-Malki told a press conference in Riyadh that an investigation into Saturday\u2019s strikes, which had been claimed by the Houthi group, was still ongoing and authorities were trying to ascertain the launch location. The conflict in Yemen has been raging since 2015, with a terrible death toll. Figures released in June showed that almost 100,000 people have been killed, including thousands through the deliberate targeting of civilians. Last year, charities warned that millions of children are at risk of starvation: The Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen is giving a news conference now, and claimed that they have evidence that Iran is behind Saturday\u2019s attacks. It\u2019s being streamed here: No translation, I\u2019m afraid, but coalition spokesman Colonel Turki al-Malki has said that The coalition has the capacity to defend \u201cvital installations\u201d Investigations into the attacks on Saudi oil facilities are \u201congoing\u201d Initial indications are that the attack didn\u2019t come from Yemen... ...and that the weapons used are Iranian The coalition is now studying the place where the attacks came from. Time for a quick recap. The oil price has surged after Saudi Arabia\u2019s largest production facility was attacked on Saturday, sparking fears of conflict in the Middle East. Brent crude leapt by 20% in early trading to almost $72 per barrel - a record move, according to Bloomberg data. It then dipped back on hope that oil reserves will be released to avoid supply shortages. At 2pm UK time, crude was up almost 11% at $66.80 per barrel, a two-month high. The attack has removed more than five million barrels of oil from the market per day - or over half Saudi Arabia\u2019s production -- making it the biggest knock to output ever. The US has blamed Iran, a claim which Tehran has dismissed. US energy secretary Rick Parry warned: \u201cMake no mistake about it, this was a deliberate attack on the global economy and the global energy market.\u201d Donald Trump moved quickly, tweeting overnight that he would unlock America\u2019s strategic oil reserves. But he also raise the threat of military action, saying the US was \u2018locked and loaded\u2019 to respond to the perpetrator. Trump has also claimed that America doesn\u2019t need Middle East oil, as it is a net energy exporter (or at least it should be next year...) UK foreign secretary Dominic Raab said the attack was a \u201cvery serious and outrageous attack\u201d, but wouldn\u2019t say whether Britain might join any military response. Oil experts fear that the oil price could keep rising, if Saudi Arabia can\u2019t repair the damage quickly. Goldman Sachs have predicted crude could hit $75 per barrel - there\u2019s even talk that we could see $100/barrel again. Economists have warned that the global economy could suffer -- more expensive oil means higher transport costs, leading to lower consumer spending. Ivan Petrella, associate professor of economics at Warwick Business School, says: \u201cWith the economy already showing clear signs of slowing down in most developed and developing countries, high oil prices could be the straw that breaks the camel\u2019s back contributing to a recession. \u201cCentral banks around the world will be forced to rethink their current policy stance if this rise in oil prices is passed onto the public through inflation.\u201d Shares in oil producers have soared, with BP gaining 5.5% and Royal Dutch Shell now up 3.2%. European stock markets are in the red, though, as investors worry about the impact to growth. The Wall Street Journal has heard that Saudi Arabia is considering delaying the huge stock market flotation of its Aramco oil business. Last weekend\u2019s attacks on Aramco\u2019s facilities has introduced a new complexity to the proposed IPO, which has already proved painful. The WSJ says: The attacks on Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil facilities are testing new top officials at the Saudi Arabian Oil Co. and the kingdom\u2019s national oil ministry, adding a fresh element of risk for international investors hoping to take part in Aramco\u2019s initial public offering of stock. Saudi Aramco is gearing up for a two-part IPO, in which it hopes to first sell a sliver of itself to investors on the local Saudi exchange, and then list shares internationally, according to people familiar with the matter. The listing plans have long been dogged by questions over valuation and the venue for an international stock-market debut. Donald Trump has made another attempt to calm the oil markets, declaring that the US economy doesn\u2019t need supplies from the Middle East anyway. He\u2019s tweeted that the US is now a \u2018net energy exporter\u2019, but will still help \u201callies\u201d in the region (Saudi Arabia). Is Trump correct? Not exactly... The IEA has predicted that America will become a net energy exporter in 2020, so it\u2019s probably not there yet. The US did become a net gas exporter in 2017 (producing more than it consumed). But yes, the US did overtake Saudi Arabia for oil production last week, partly thanks to the shale oil boom. Roadside assistance group the RAC has warned petrol stations not to hike prices, on the back of the Saudi attacks. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams says retailers have only just begun passing on recent FALLS in the oil price -- so shouldn\u2019t now race to put prices up again. \u201cThere was an inevitable initial panic-driven surge in the oil price on Monday morning, but the situation then cooled. While the wholesale prices of both petrol and diesel look set to increase by 3p a litre, this doesn\u2019t necessarily mean higher prices at the pumps because retailers only just began to pass on overdue wholesale price savings at the end of last week. At that point the 128p forecourt price of petrol was 7p too high which means retailers should have a cushion to absorb the spike. If the barrel price remains high for a sustained period however, it could easily lead to several pence a litre being added to the average price of both fuels. Even after Friday\u2019s 3p supermarket cut petrol is still averaging 127.77p and diesel 131.26p. \u201cWe are hopeful the fact the US is releasing emergency oil stocks and that Saudi Arabia operates a global storage network will mean that drivers here in the UK will not be too harshly affected.\u201d The US stock market is expected to dip when trading begins in 90 minutes. The Dow is down 100 point, or 0.4%, in the future market with airline stocks likely to fall sharply (as in Europe). The Saudi attack is the biggest ever disruption to oil production, due to the importance of the Abqaiq site -- the largest of its type in the word. Abqaiq produces around 70% of Saudi Arabia\u2019s output, which exceeds 9.6 million barrels per day. Saturday\u2019s attack is thought to have removed 5.7m barrels from the market, even more than were knocked off by the Iranian revolution 40 years ago. Having said that, the oil market was smaller in 1979, when protests cut Iranian production from 6m barrels per day to 1.5m. And the true impact of the Saudi attacks will depend on how quickly the facilities are prepared. Geoffrey Smith, Director of Oil &amp; Shipping Research at Refinitiv, comments: \u201cWe are seeing oil loadings out of Saudi resume and are increasing to handle the shortfall over the weekend. The question is for how long Saudi Arabia can maintain export levels and quality while the damage is fixed. The most likely effects are to be felt from November onwards as storage might start hitting critical levels if the processing facility has not been repaired. A spokesman for UK prime minister Boris Johnson has condemned the Saudi attacks as a \u201cwanton violation\u201d of international law, at today\u2019s briefing with journalists in Westminster. Q: Could the UK release some of its oil reserves? The UK business department is monitoring the situation closely, and working with the International Energy Agency*, Johnson\u2019s spokesman explained. * - the IEA would organise any co-ordinated international response The US secretary of energy, Rick Perry, has condemned Iran for attacking Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil facilities (which Tehran has denied), but also insisted the oil market is \u2018robust\u2019. Perry was speaking at the International Atomic Energy Agency\u2019s general conference in Vienna today. He said that the attack was \u201cunacceptable\u201d and that Iran \u201cmust be held responsible\u201d, adding: \u201cMake no mistake about it, this was a deliberate attack on the global economy and the global energy market.\u201d (thanks to Associated Press for the quote). Perry added that the market was \u201cresilient\u201d, and predicted it would \u201crespond positively\u201d to the attack. Here\u2019s a Q&amp;A explaining how the Saudi oil attacks took place, why it has geopolitical consequences, and what could happen next: Amrita Sen, analyst at Energy Aspects, says consumers will see the impact of today\u2019s oil price spike in a few weeks time. Speaking on Sky News, she also predicts that the International Energy Agency could organise a \u201cco-ordinated release of oil\u201d if Saudi production remains disrupted for weeks. That would protect consumers from a price spike. IEA consumer countries are required to hold emergency oil stocks equivalent to 90 days\u2019 worth of net imports, so there is some firepower to deploy. Goldman Sachs has predicted that oil could hit $75 per barrel (or 25% higher than last Friday), if Saudi oil supplies are disrupted for six weeks or more. Currently, around half of Saudi Arabia\u2019s 9.6million barrels per day have been knocked offline by Saturday\u2019s attack. The key question is how quickly they return. Goldman told clients that the longer the delay, the higher prices will go - even if America unlocks its strategic oil reserves to cope (as president Trump has pledged). But if the oil price keeps rising, shale oil producers could hike their own output to cope. Goldman says. Demand would also suffer, which could cap prices. \u201cAn extreme net outage of a 4 mb/d (million barrels per day) for more than three months would likely bring prices above $75/bbl to trigger both large shale supply and demand responses.\u201d The Europe-wide Stoxx 600 index has lost 0.6% this morning, with most sectors in the red. Consumer-focused companies, banks and industrial groups are the top fallers, reflecting worries that an oil price shock could hurt the global economy. Energy stocks have surged through, up 2.6% on average. Reuters has heard that it may take \u201cmonths\u201d for Saudi Aramco to resume normal output volumes. They say: Saudi Aramco\u2019s full return to normal oil production volumes \u201cmay take months\u201d, two sources briefed on the company\u2019s operations said on Monday, after attacks on Saudi oil plants knocked out more than half of the country\u2019s output. \u201cIt is still bad,\u201d one source said. S&amp;P Global Platts has predicted that the oil price could test $80 per barrel if the situation deteriorates. The attack is an escalation in severity after a number of strikes on key oil infrastructure and transit routes in the Middle East this year. Flows had been temporarily halted through Saudi Arabia\u2019s main oil transport pipeline to terminals and refineries on the Red Sea, while oil tankers have been attacked in the Strait of Hormuz maritime chokepoint. Kit Juckes of French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale says the loss of half Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil production has left the markets with three questions: How fast can supply recover, can further attacks be prevented, and what will the wider geopolitical implications be? Oil prices spiked higher but drifted down into the European open. However, even for those who aren\u2019t sceptical about Saudi claims to be able to restore a third of the lost output as early as today, there is bound to be a higher risk premium attached to prices going forwards. Slower global growth was beginning to act as a drag on oil prices, but the risk premium goes the other way and that in turn is another drag on global growth The Daily Telegraph predicts that petrol prices will rise quickly, as the impact of today\u2019s crude oil move feeds through to the forecourt. They say: Markets are braced for a spike in the cost of crude, and analysts expect the costs of the crisis to be felt at the pumps almost immediately. Ashley Kelty, a veteran oil and gas analyst, said he would expect petrol prices to jump \u201cat least 5p per gallon in the coming days and further hikes to come as news comes out on the longer term impact of the Saudi outage\u201d. More here: It should take a few weeks for oil bought today to be refined, shipped and sold. The BBC\u2019s John Campbell suspects some suppliers aren\u2019t hanging about, though: Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, believes rising tensions in the Middle East could push the oil price as high as $100 per barrel. Crude hasn\u2019t been that high since 2014, and it would take a 50% surge to get back there. That may seem extreme, but a prolonged period of disruption could push prices sharply high, Sayed argues. That\u2019s because the oil market is now suddenly undersupplied, having lost 5% of supplies overnight. Sayed says: Three days ago, oil prices hitting $100 a barrel was almost an impossible scenario. Not anymore. That\u2019s not just because of the current disruption from Saudi Arabia, but the fact that the chances of military conflict in the region have risen dramatically. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo blamed Iran for the drone attacks, and Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said the United States should consider an attack on Iran\u2019s oil refineries. Meanwhile President Trump warned that the US is \u2018locked and loaded\u2019. If such statements continue to flow from the US administration, geopolitical risk premium would increase significantly as any strike against Iran may put the whole Gulf region in jeopardy. If investors begin pricing in the possibility of an attack against Iran\u2019s crude infrastructure, oil may quickly hit the $100 benchmark. Britain\u2019s foreign secretary, Dominic Raab has described the attacks as \u2018despicable\u2019 - but was cautious about whether the UK could take part in any military response. He told Sky News: The attack on the Aramco installations was a wanton violation of international law It\u2019s despicable. We stand firmly in support of our Saudi partners and the other international players and countries in the region. Raab says it was \u201cnot entirely clear who is responsible\u201d, but he hopes to get a \u201cvery clear picture\u201d shortly Q: Could we provide military support to Saudi Arabie? Raab says it\u2019s too early for such a question. We need to get the full facts first, and he\u2019s not going to prejudge until we have them. Q: How worried should we be about volatility in the markets? We\u2019ll have to see how the situation plays out this week, Raab replies. It was a very serious attack on Saudi Arabia which has implications for the global oil market and supplies, he said, adding: It\u2019s a very serious and outrageous act. It needs as clear and united international response as possible. Shares in oil companies have jumped this morning, following the jump in crude prices. BP is the top riser on the FTSE 100, up 3.8%, closely followed by Royal Dutch Shell which is 2.8% higher. Smaller oil producers are also sharply higher. BAE Systems, the weapons maker, has gained 0.7% -- suggesting traders are anticipating heightened military tensions. But most stocks are down this morning, knocking 0.5% or 35 points off the FTSE 100 in early trading. Airline, though, are suffering. British Airways\u2019 parent company, IAG, is down 2.2%, and easyJet has lost 2.5%. Concerns is swirling that the jump in the oil price could hurt global growth, and possibly trigger a downturn. Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit points out that the world economy was already looking vulnerable: Ranko Berich, Head of Market Analysis at Monex Europe, agrees -- calling the jump in crude prices \u2018ominous\u2019. The weekend\u2019s attacks in Saudi Arabia will have two consequences for financial markets and the global economy: the immediate oil price shock, which has already hit, and the longer-term costs of increased tensions or even a possible outbreak of conflict in the Persian Gulf. \u201cThe size of the initial shock to oil prices was immense. Spot prices have surged by amounts unprecedented since the 1990 Iraq invasion of Kuwait, while Brent crude oil futures recorded their largest intraday surge since trading began in 1988, although since then the initial knee jerk surge has been pared bac Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at trading firm OANDA, warns that the world economy could be tipped into a downturn. The attack was as severe as it was unexpected but that\u2019s not the worst thing about it. Saudi Arabia believes a significant proportion of the outages can be back online in a few days while Trump also approved release of supplies from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to ensure the market remains well surprised. None of this should make us feel relaxed about the potential for further attacks though and the longer-term implications on the oil market. Spikes in oil prices when the global economy is already flirting with the idea of recession is not ideal and, if repeated and sustained, could ultimately be what tips us over the edge. Saudi Aramco, the oil giant, has told Indian refiners that there will be no shortage in supplies, according to the Indian oil ministry (Reuters reports from New Delhi). Although today\u2019s 20% spike is the biggest intraday move under modern trading, there have been dramatic shifts in the past. Back in 1973, the Opec cartel doubled the price of oil overnight (from $5.12 a barrel to $11.65). That created a huge inflation shock, and even forced America to lower its speeding limits to preserve gasoline supplies. Here\u2019s a chart showing how oil made its biggest intraday jump since the crude futures contract was created over 30 years ago: Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, explains: Brent crude jumped 19%, as WTI crude surged 15% at the weekly opening bell, after a drone attack on Saudi Arabia\u2019s state oil company Aramco halved the country\u2019s production over the weekend. This has been the biggest one-time disruption in oil supply in the history, which has resulted in the largest single jump in prices in record.... The Saudi incident increased tensions between the US and Iran, as the US accused Iran of the drone strikes on Aramco. Iran refused. But regardless of who is responsible for these attacks, the US accusations on Iran can only wash away the hopes for improved diplomatic relations between the two countries following Bolton\u2019s departure last week. Hence, oil prices should settle higher than their pre-attack levels. The 20% surge in the oil price this morning is the biggest intraday move since the Brent crude contract was created in the 80s, according to Bloomberg. It says: Oil posted its biggest ever intraday jump this morning, to more than $71 a barrel after a strike on a Saudi Arabian oil facility removed about 5% of global supplies, an attack the U.S. has blamed on Iran. In an extraordinary start to trading on Monday, London\u2019s Brent futures leapt almost $12 in the seconds after the open, the most in dollar terms since they were launched in 1988. Prices have since pulled back about half of that initial surge of almost 20%, but were still heading for the biggest advance in more than three years. \u201cWe have never seen a supply disruption and price response like this in the oil market,\u201d said Saul Kavonic, an energy analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG. \u201cPolitical risk premium are now back on the oil market agenda.\u201d More here: Oil Jumps Most on Record After Attack Cuts Saudi Arabian Supply Here\u2019s our news story on the Saudi attacks: Donald Trump has tried to calm the oil market, by opening the taps on America\u2019s stocks of crude oil. That could mitigate the impact of losing half of Saudi Arabia\u2019s production, for an unknown time. Trump also warned that America is \u201clocked and loaded\u201d to retaliate, which will not calm nerves in the City. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Fears of escalating conflict in the Middle East are gripping the markets this morning, following the drone attack on Saudi Arabia\u2019s biggest oil production facility on Saturday. The attacks leave Saudi Arabia facing weeks without full crude and gas production capacity, and ratchet up the geopolitical tensions in the region. The oil price has surged 10% this morning (it was up 20% at one stage!) amid fears of disruption to energy supplies. Brent crude oil hit $71.95 for the first time since May, and is currently changing hands at $66.63 per barrel, up from just $60 on Friday night. This will push up fuel and heating costs -- lifting inflation and potentially weakening the global economy at a critical moment. Houthi rebels based in Yemen have claimed responsibility for the attack, saying they used 10 drones to knock out facilities at two sites, creating a huge fire. The attack has real consequences for the global economy, taking about 5% of production offline. The production facilities at Abqaiq and Khurais produce more than half of Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil -- which makes up 10% of global supplies. It also raises the tensions between the US and Iran, with Washington blaming Tehran for the attack. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declared: \u201cIran has now launched an unprecedented attack on the world\u2019s energy supply.\u201d Iran denied the charge, with its foreign minister accusing Pompeo of \u201cblind accusations and inappropriate comments\u201d. Financial experts are worried. Royal Bank of Canada\u2019s Helima Croft says this attack is the most serious assault to date on the country\u2019s energy infrastructure. RBC says: Though Aramco officials have indicated that exports will resume in the next few days, there is nothing to suggest that this is a one-off event and that the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels will forgo further strikes on Saudi sites. European stock markets are expected to drop, with the main indices called down between 0.3% and 0.6%. Otherwise there\u2019s not much in the calendar, beyond a new survey of factories in the New York region. The agenda 1.30pm BST: US Empire manufacturing report",

I\u2019m not sure \u2014 I\u2019m not saying it would have solved the Syrian crisis but it was a red line crossed, it was an appalling thing to happen.

Here\u2019s a portion of that exchange:</p> \n  <p>Kuenssberg asked Johnson how he intended to \u201cget round\u201d that law, noting that he has said he will not delay Brexit. He replied:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I won\u2019t. Here\u2019s, here\u2019s what I want.

I mean to be really clear about this, Parliament has changed the law to make it almost impossible to take us out of the EU without a deal at the end of October. But you say that you will not do it. That means that you must be looking for a way around the law?\u201d Johnson replied:<br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Well you know those are your words.

Boris Johnson was asked repeatedly by the BBC\u2019s political editor, <strong>Laura Kuenssberg</strong>, to outline the details of the proposals he has made to the European Union. Johnson said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I mean, there is a negotiation going on, has been for a long time now, about how to do this. So there\u2019s a limit to how much the details benefit from publicity before we\u2019ve actually done the deal.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Kuenssberg asked him if he intended to \u201cslice and dice the backstop\u201d. Johnson replied:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The shape of it is all about who decides. Fundamentally, the problem with the backstop ... is that it\u2019s a device by which the EU can continue after we\u2019ve left to control our trade laws, control our tariffs, control huge chunks of our regulation and we have to keep accepting laws from Brussels long after we\u2019ve left with no say on those laws. Now that just doesn\u2019t work. It doesn\u2019t work for the whole of the UK and it doesn\u2019t work for Northern Ireland. So we have to find a way to avoid that situation.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Kuenssberg tried again, suggesting that Johnson was \u201cjust articulating the problem that\u2019s been articulated for ever about the backstop\u201d. She asked him: \u201cCan you foresee a solution, for example, where \u2013 in some areas \u2013 Northern Ireland would follow EU rules and the rest of the UK would not?\u201d Johnson replied:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>What we want to see is a solution where the decision is taken by the UK and clearly that\u2019s the problem with the backstop; it basically leaves the decision-making up to Brussels and that\u2019s no good.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Kuenssberg tried yet again, asking the prime minister: \u201cWhat\u2019s the actual solution that you\u2019re proposing? Is it giving more power to Stormont, for example, that\u2019s being talked about a lot; that the Northern Irish assembly might be given a lock on opting out or opting in on EU regulation?\u201d Johnson replied:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>These are certainly some of the ideas that are being talked about and as are the ideas that you\u2019re familiar with to do with maximum facilitations, to do with checks away from the border all sorts of ways in which you can avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland.

He deputised while she was on maternity leave and apparently relishes the task. \u201cHe\u2019s a happy warrior; he\u2019s one of those people who does actually enjoy it,\u201d said one party figure, who points at Carlaw\u2019s pedigree as a serial election candidate (he first stood for the party in 1982) and former Scottish party deputy chairman.</p> \n  <p>Some Scottish Tories moot postponing the leadership contest until after the next Holyrood election in 2021, citing the additional challenge of opposing Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s push for an early Scottish independence vote \u2013 a push expected to intensify over coming months.</p> \n  <p>A delay of that length is highly unlikely.

(See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/sep/16/brexit-latest-news-boris-johnson-talks-juncker-eu-must-show-flexibility-says-raab-ahead-of-boris-johnsons-key-meeting-with-juncker-live-news-latest-news?page=with:block-5d7f99dc8f08f30dc5bbc598#block-5d7f99dc8f08f30dc5bbc598\">3.31pm.) </a>The prime minister of Luxembourg was speaking in English, but it is not his first language, and so occasionally I have tidied up his syntax just so that it reads more clearly.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Bettel accused Boris Johnson of creating a \u201cnightmare\u201d of uncertainty for EU citizens by failing to clarify what he wanted from Brexit.</strong> In his opening statement Bettel said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Our people need to know what is going to happen to them in six weeks\u2019 time. They need clarity, they need certainty and they need stability. You can\u2019t hold their future hostage for party political gains.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>At this point, gesturing to the point where Boris Johnson would have been standing if he had joined the press conference, Bettel went on:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Now it\u2019s on Mr Johnson \u2013 he holds the future of all UK citizens and every EU citizen living in the UK in his hands. It\u2019s his responsibility. Your people, our people, count on you \u2013 but the clock is ticking, use your time wisely.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>In this there was an echo of what Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, said when the EU granted a Brexit extension in April. <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-politics-47889208/tusk-on-brexit-extension-please-do-not-waste-this-time\">\u201cPlease do not waste this time,\u201d Tusk said.</a> Many EU leaders think the UK has wasted this time.</p> \n  <p>At another point, in response to a question about a possible extension to the transition period, Bettel again said EU citizens needed certainty. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The fact is our citizens want to have certainty. As long as they don\u2019t know what is going to happen they don\u2019t know what will be their own future ... This is a nightmare.</p> \n   <p>People would love to have clarity, they would love to know what is going to happen.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He complained that Johnson had not tabled firm proposals for an alternative to the backstop.</strong> \u201cWe need more than just words,\u201d he said in his opening statement, referring to the need for a proposal in writing. And then, in the Q&amp;A, he said: </li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The meeting was longer than planned. We [talked] about the different positions of the UK government. But I repeat \u2013 I told him, I hear a lot, but I don\u2019t read a lot. If they want us to be able to discuss anything, we need it on the written side.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He said the only written text on the table at the moment was the existing withdrawal agreement.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He dismissed Johnson\u2019s claim that significant progress has been made in the talks. </strong>When asked about this, Bettel replied:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>For me, I just have one withdrawal agreement on the table. And it\u2019s the one from last year. There are no changes. There are no concrete proposals for the moment on the table. And I won\u2019t give an agreement to ideas. We need written proposals and the time is ticking. So stop speaking, but act if you want to discuss different proposals, but we won\u2019t accept any agreement [which] goes against the single market [or] the Good Friday agreement.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He mocked what was said in London about Johnson\u2019s Brexit strategy, saying that he had \u201cread in the papers a few days ago that it goes from big progress to [Incredible] Hulk to David Cameron proposing a second Brexit\u201d.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Bettel suggested that, if there were a no-deal Brexit, it would take years for the two sides to reach a subsequent agreement on trade.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said he was not confident that Johnson would be able to get any deal through the House of Commons.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Bettel said any Brexit deal had to protect the EU single market and the Good Friday agreement.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said the UK alone was to blame for the Brexit crisis.</strong> He and other EU leaders would not take responsibility, he said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Some people would love to give the blame to another. Not being responsible for the situation.</p> \n   <p>One party, the Conservative party, decided to organise that referendum ...</p> \n   <p>Now people try to blame the others because we cannot find an agreement.</p> \n   <p>We did not decide to organise Brexit. It was a unilateral decision of the UK government. We have to accept the result.</p> \n   <p>But it is not now in a unilateral way that the UK government will decide its next relations with the EU.</p> \n   <p>We sit around the table. We have a withdrawal agreement. And this withdrawal agreement has been accepted by the UK government. I just want to repeat and remind [you] that Theresa May accepted the withdrawal agreement. So don\u2019t make it that the European Union will be the bad guy, not accepting decisions that the UK proposes ...</p> \n   <p>These are homemade problems. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He also said that neither he, as a European leader, nor the commission, nor the EU27 as a whole were responsible \u201cfor the mess we\u2019re in\u201d.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said he would only back an extension of article 50 if it were to serve a purpose. </strong>He said further delay was not in the interests of EU citizens.

Normally in these circumstances the polite thing to do is to rearrange.

At one point he even gestured at the space where Johnson was supposed to be.</p> \n  <p>Then Bettel just let rip. People often wonder what EU leaders say or think about Johnson in private. Well, now we know. The leave campaign was a pack of lies, Johnson\u2019s talk of progress in the Brexit negotiations is unfounded, the UK still has not come up with any ideas about an alternative to the backstop. On and on he went, with particular emphasis on the point that the UK, not the EU, was to blame for the crisis. It was a \u201cnightmare\u201d for EU citizens, said Bettel. At several points he was loudly applauded by the protesters, because they felt he was articulating their anger. </p> \n  <p>Yesterday, Johnson depicted himself as the Incredible Hulk.

Several extracts have already been published, and the Times published a long interview with Cameron on Saturday. You can read about those <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron\">here</a>. Here are some of the new lines from what Cameron told ITV.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Cameron suggests it might have been better to speed up the cuts required under his austerity programme.</strong> Asked to defend the austerity cuts, he said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think, look, the cuts were very difficult to make and there were lots of very difficult decisions and I\u2019m not sure we got all of them right, but I\u2019ve never wavered in the belief that it was necessary to make difficult decisions\u2026</p> \n   <p>There is a case for saying that some of the changes we had to make in year two, in year three, in year four \u2013 it might have been better if we did a little bit more a bit earlier. When you have that sort of window of permission from the public, I felt after the 2010 election, you know, we\u2019d fought an election, rather untraditionally, saying; \u2018If you elect us, we\u2019re going to make cuts and people will look back at this period and there\u2019ll be great big arguments about it.\u2019</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said Boris Johnson told him in a text message sent shortly before he publicly announced that he was campaigning for leave that he expected Brexit to be \u201ccrushed\u201d in the referendum.</strong> Asked what he thought were Johnson\u2019s motives for supporting leave, Cameron said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>My conclusion is; he thought that the Brexit vote would be lost but he didn\u2019t want to give up the chance of being on the romantic, patriotic nationalistic side of Brexit.</p> \n   <p>Minutes before he went out to explain why he was going to be on the side of Brexit, he sent me a text saying, \u2018Brexit will be crushed like a toad under the harrow.\u2019... but I can only conclude that \u2013 he\u2019d never argued for it before; he thought it was going to lose and that\u2019s why he made the choice.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Cameron firmly ruled out out a return to frontline politics</strong>. Asked if he would ever return to frontline politics, he replied:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p><em>No \u2026 </em><em>I love this country. I care passionately about what happens. But I think the idea of going back to frontline politics is not going to happen, nor should it.</em></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said Johnson\u2019s decision to suspend parliament for five-weeks would turn out to be \u201ccounterproductive\u201d.</strong> Asked if the decision to suspend (prorogue, in parliamentary jargon) was right, Cameron replied:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I don\u2019t. We\u2019ll wait for what the courts say. I don\u2019t think it was illegal. It looked to me, from the outside, like rather sharp practice of trying to restrict the debate and I thought it was actually from his point of view probably counterproductive. In the end, we have to work through parliament, and you can\u2019t deny the arithmetic of parliament and the majorities there are in parliament.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said it would be \u201cdisastrous\u201d for the Conservatives if the decision to suspend the whip was not reversed. </strong>He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I obviously disagree with the idea of taking away the whip from 21 hard-working, loyal Conservatives. I think that was a bad decision, if it isn\u2019t reversed, it will be I think a disastrous decision. I hope that Boris will get a deal in Brussels, he will come back, try and bring parliament together to back that deal \u2013 I don\u2019t see why those 21 people shouldn\u2019t be restored to the Conservative whip. If they\u2019re not, I really worry about what could happen.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n   <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"bab5a5d4-6f08-4d69-be69-235f1e06e449\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n    <div>\n     <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cUVQLemlUqE?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n    </div>\n   </gu-atom> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-16T13:35:52.662Z\">at 2.35pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d7f83ba8f0834740f3bc20b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-16T12:46:09.243Z\">1.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Contrary to what was being reported quite widely this morning, there were no snails on the menu when Boris Johnson had lunch with Jean-Claude Juncker, the BBC\u2019s <strong>Adam Fleming</strong> reports.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/adamfleming/status/1173573084537872384\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">DROP EVERYTHING.

Donohoe told Dublin City University\u2019s Brexit Institute that Britain\u2019s intentions were clear from <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/826166/20190819_PM_letter_to_His_Excellency_Mr_Donald_Tusk.pdf\">the letter (pdf) </a>that Boris Johnson sent to Donald Tusk in August. Donohoe went on:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The challenges and opportunities that Ireland will face in the medium term will be heavily influenced by how far the United Kingdom decides to diverge from the European Union. </p> \n   <p>While the Irish government will absolutely respect the choice of the British government to pursue a path of regulatory divergence from the EU, there are clear implications for this island and the Good Friday agreement that cannot be ignored in the event that this becomes its policy.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Donohoe also said unionists should not view the backstop as a threat. It was a compromise, he said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I understand the fears that some in the unionist community have expressed about the backstop.</p> \n   <p>The government takes these concerns very seriously, as we do the concerns of everyone who is troubled by Brexit and its potential impacts on both parts of our island. </p> \n   <p>However, the backstop should not be viewed as a challenge to unionism. </p> \n   <p>Its purpose is to provide certainty to businesses and communities on both sides of the border that they will be able to continue to operate and go about their daily lives as they do today.

(See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/sep/16/brexit-latest-news-boris-johnson-talks-juncker-eu-must-show-flexibility-says-raab-ahead-of-boris-johnsons-key-meeting-with-juncker-live-news-latest-news?page=with:block-5d7f37c68f08f30dc5bbc12b#block-5d7f37c68f08f30dc5bbc12b\"> 9.07am.)</a></p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Raab insisted that the UK was not considering extending the planned Brexit transition period. </strong>Under the withdrawal agreement negotiated by Theresa May, there would be a transition period after the UK left the EU during which it would effectively remain bound by EU law, to allow both sides time to adjust. Originally the transition was due to last 21 months, ending in December 2020, although there was an option to extend it for a year or two. If the UK were to leave on 31 October, as the government wants, it would only last 14 months. Yesterday Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/uk-transition-deal-eu-could-20069033\">hinted the government might want to use the option to extend. But Raab seemed to rule out the idea</a>. He told Today:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>No, it is not something under consideration.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This may be more wishful thinking than a firm guide to the future. The plan was for the transition to last until the UK and the EU had negotiated a future trade deal. But <strong>P</strong><strong>hil Hogan</strong>, who has just been appointed as the EU\u2019s new trade commissioner, <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/penny-finally-dropping-for-uk-on-brexit-says-phil-hogan-1.4013645\">told the Irish Times last week</a> that it would take him up to eight months to put a new negotiating team together. After that, negotiating a trade deal with the UK would take \u201ca number of years\u201d, he said. Even if the UK and EU were to agree a withdrawal agreement next week, it is impossible to imagine a full trade deal being completed by December next year.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Raab hinted that the government would want to test the Benn Act passed by parliament with the intention of ruling out a no-deal Brexit. </strong>Asked if the government would defy the law, as some briefing from No 10 has implied, he replied:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The UK government is always going to behave lawfully.

He is having lunch with Jean-Claude Juncker, the outgoing president of the European commission, and although the EU October summit, which is seen by many as the place where an agreement may or may not get finalised, is more than a month away, in <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/09/15/passionately-believe-can-strike-eu-deal-within-weeks/\">an article for today\u2019s Daily Telegraph (paywall) </a>Johnson claims the next few days will be crucial in determining whether a deal can be done. He says:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>If we can make enough progress in the next few days, I intend to go to that crucial summit on Oct 17, and finalise an agreement that will protect the interests of business and citizens on both sides of the Channel, and on both sides of the border in Ireland. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>In August, Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, appeared to give Johnson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/aug/21/brexit-latest-news-boris-johnson-berlin-merkel-prepares-to-visit-berlin-as-minister-struggles-to-defend-his-collaborators-jibe-live-news?page=with:block-5d5d7dde8f081cf11cf1a9a6#block-5d5d7dde8f081cf11cf1a9a6\">a 30-day deadline</a> to come up with an alternative to the backstop that was acceptable to the EU and would allow the two sides to reach an agreement. Twenty-six days later EU figures are complaining that the UK still has not tabled any firm plans for a backstop replacement. But, in interviews this morning,<strong> Dominic Raab</strong>, the foreign secretary, insisted the EU knew exactly what the UK was proposing and that a plan had just not been tabled formally because that would become a \u201ctrap\u201d. He told Sky News:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>On all sides, for those that don\u2019t want a deal, or who want to put pressure on the UK, there\u2019s an attempt to elicit more and more concessions, and more and more detail, as a diplomatic pressure exercise. We are not going to fall into that trap.</p> \n   <p>But I can reassure you that the details and the shape of the deal have been discussed at a political level, and Boris Johnson is out there talking to Jean-Claude Juncker today about that. They\u2019ve been discussed at technical level.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Raab said it was now up to the EU to compromise. He told Sky:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>So this isn\u2019t about whether enough technical content has been provided. It is about whether there\u2019s the political will on the EU\u2019s side to do a deal which I still believe would be in both sides\u2019 interests.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>And he delivered the same message on the Today programme, when he said it was up to the EU to show \u201cpragmatism and flexibility\u201d. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We\u2019ve been clear [what the UK is proposing] and will continue to flesh out and respond to any questions. But of course, at some point, the EU is going to have to put up its hand and say: \u2018OK, we know that there\u2019s the requirement for some pragmatism and flexibility to get this deal over the line\u2019, because the previous deal, which I understand why they want to stick to, failed so dramatically ...</p> \n   <p>I think it has come to that moment in time, as we lead into the October council, for the decisions to be made. We\u2019re willing and able to do a deal on the terms I\u2019ve described. The question now is whether the EU has got the political will to meet us to get that deal which is good for both sides.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>I will post more from his interviews shortly.</p> \n  <p>Here is the agenda for the day.</p> \n  <p><em>11am:</em> Downing Street lobby briefing.</p> \n  <p><em>11am: </em>Paschal Donohoe, the Irish finance minister, gives a speech on Brexit in Dublin.</p> \n  <p><em>11am:</em> Chuka Umunna, the former Labour MP who is now the Lib Dem foreign affairs spokesman, speaks at the Lib Dem conference.</p> \n  <p><em>11am (UK time): </em>Boris Johnson meets Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European commission, for lunch. </p> \n  <p><em>1pm (UK time): </em>Johnson holds a meeting with Xavier Bettel, the prime minister of Luxembourg.

      "bodyText": "There\u2019s all from us this evening. Here\u2019s a summary of the day\u2019s main events: Boris Johnson was left humiliated after he was represented at a press conference with Luxembourg\u2019s prime minister by an empty lectern. Johnson pulled out of the event shortly before it was due to go ahead, saying protests going on nearby were too loud. Xavier Bettel, appearing alone, warned Johnson not to waste the time that remained. Bettel said Brexit was an internal UK issue that was being exported to Europe and that it was up to the UK to propose a solution. Johnson claimed the UK and the EU have \u201cjust the right amount of time\u201d to get a deal done. But, asked repeatedly what he was proposing, he was unable to give a clear answer. The former prime minister David Cameron, ruled out a return to frontline politics. In another interview to promote his book, Cameron said he should have pushed his government\u2019s austerity measures further, earlier. If you\u2019d like to read more, my colleague Daniel Boffey has the main story: And that wraps up the interview. Once again, the latest posts should be read alongside the more comprehensive summary posted earlier this afternoon. Referring to the man he considered a friend, Michael Gove, Cameron says: To be fair to Michael, he was a very long standing Eurosceptic. He seemed in two minds about it and I thought: \u2018If he\u2019s in two minds surely stick with the team and the programme and the government and the work that we\u2019re doing together\u2019. Asked if he felt betrayed by Gove, Cameron adds: He said to me at the time: \u2018If I come out for Brexit, I\u2019ll make one speech and that\u2019s it\u2019. And, look, I believed that. Now maybe that was naive; maybe that was wrong but I mean, I start from the proposition that if someone you\u2019ve known for 20 years tells you something it\u2019s probably true. [During the campaign,] he went from this liberal, modern, compassionate Conservative to something quite different. Asked about his reference to Gove and the prime minister, Boris Johnson, as \u201cambassadors for the post-truth age\u201d, Cameron says: There was some things that happened in the campaign and things that Michael and Boris signed up to that I found deeply depressing because I didn\u2019t think it was who they were. Cameron is discussing the use of chemical weapons in Syria. ITV\u2019s Tom Bradby shows him a television news report of such an attack and asks him to discuss his reaction, as well as those of other world leaders. Cameron tells him: I watched it on the television and the sight of the children laid out in rows made me think of Ivan and everything that had happened to me and I thought it was just so appalling. I felt we\u2019ve got to act. President Obama and I had discussed the red line, I think at the G8 in Northern Ireland of the use of chemical weapons and so I immediately thought; well we must, you know, get together and act. Bradby asks Cameron: \u201cAt this point, it takes [Obama] four days, you know \u2014 four whole days\u2014 to even return your telephone calls. Cameron responds: I think a more automatic response would have been better. As it was; it took four days to speak; we then agreed a plan. Referring to the vote on intervention against Assad in Syria, Cameron adds: I lost that vote; the first time a prime minister had lost a vote in the House of Commons on a major issue of foreign policy. I blame the people who voted against me, obviously, but I also blame myself. I misread the situation but I think we should have acted. I\u2019m not sure \u2014 I\u2019m not saying it would have solved the Syrian crisis but it was a red line crossed, it was an appalling thing to happen. I made a passionate argument in parliament, but I lost that. I lost that vote. ITV are broadcasting their interview with David Cameron now. It was heavily trailed and we published a fairly comprehensive summary here but we\u2019ll bring you any other new lines as they emerge. Labour have called on Liz Truss to resign as international trade secretary after she admitted her department allowed the sale of arms and military equipment that could be used by the Saudi regime in the conflict in Yemen. In June, the court of appeal ruled that British arms sales to the kingdom were unlawful and the government undertook not to grant any new licences for equipment that \u201cmight be used in the conflict in Yemen\u201d. In a letter to the chair of the Commons committees on arms export controls, Liz Truss has admitted to a series of breaches. In response, the shadow trade secretary, Barry Gardiner, has said: Yet again, it appears there is one law for Conservative ministers and another for everyone else. The Tories have repeatedly claimed that we have the most robust licensing regime in the world. Now, it is clear that they cannot even abide by the rulings of the court of appeal. The department has failed to conduct proper assessments and essential information is not being relayed between government departments. The people of the United Kingdom do not want to be complicit in fuelling the humanitarian crisis in Yemen and the secretary of state must immediately suspend all arms sales to Saudi Arabia. Thousands of people have been killed in this war and it is staggering that the trade secretary thinks an apology will get her off the hook. Liz Truss must provide a full account of why her department failed so miserably. If she cannot control her department, obey the law and do what is morally right, she should resign. The SNP are not the only ones accusing Boris Johnson of seeking to avoid scrutiny this afternoon. Guy Verhofstadt is the European parliament\u2019s Brexit coordinator. Sir Nicholas Soames, who had the Tory whip withdrawn after voting against the government earlier this month, has criticised Luxembourg\u2019s prime minister, Xavier Bettel, for going ahead with the empty lectern press conference in the first place: Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, has spoken to his Saudi Arabian and German counterparts about the attack on the Aramco oil facility in Saudi Arabia. He is scheduled to speak to the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, later today, as well as the French foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian. The Foreign and Commonwealth office said the UK \u201ccondemns the attack and is working closely with our international partners on the most effective response\u201d. Boris Johnson is guilty of \u201cdealing in fiction\u201d, not in facts, the SNP\u2019s Westminster leader claims. Ian Blackford challenged the prime minister to publish any serious proposals he had put forward in the attempt to secure a new Brexit deal. In barely 24 hours, Boris Johnson has gone from being the Incredible Hulk to the Incredible Sulk. It is a humiliating indictment of Boris Johnson\u2019s leadership that he turned on his heel and scurried away rather than face questions today. The empty podium beside Luxembourg\u2019s PM was a damning symbol of this Tory government\u2019s incompetence and lack of vision when it comes to Brexit, which is their only policy. This is a government in headlong retreat and on its last legs. The meeting between Boris Johnson and EU President Juncker has confirmed that the UK government has failed to bring forward a single proposal to end the Brexit mess. Boris Johnson must stop dealing in fiction and start addressing the facts. Last month, Angela Merkel gave Boris Johnson 30 days to bring forward meaningful and workable plans. We are 25 days in and, instead, not a single proposal has come forward and, instead, we have witnessed an unelected Tory leader shutting down parliament, purging his party and losing every single parliamentary vote. The prime minister cannot continue to bluff his way around Europe. If he has proposals he should publish them now. With a general election looming, the SNP will be putting Scotland\u2019s opposition to Brexit and our right to choose our own future as an independent country at the heart of that contest. Scotland\u2019s voice has been completely ignored throughout this Brexit process and it\u2019s clear that the people of Scotland deserve the choice of a better future than the Brexit chaos being imposed on us by a broken and bleak Westminster system. Johnson also insisted he wouldn\u2019t delay the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union on 31 October, should no deal be struck by then, while also promising to abide by the law requiring him to request a delay in those same circumstances. He failed to explain how he intended to align these apparently contradictory positions. Here\u2019s a portion of that exchange: Kuenssberg asked Johnson how he intended to \u201cget round\u201d that law, noting that he has said he will not delay Brexit. He replied: I won\u2019t. Here\u2019s, here\u2019s what I want. I will uphold the constitution I will obey the law but we will come out on October 31st. Kuenssberg again asked the prime minister: \u201cBut how, if MPs have changed the law to stop you doing that?\u201d He responded: We\u2019re going to come out on October 31st and it\u2019s vital that people understand that the UK will not extend. We won\u2019t go on remaining in the EU beyond October. What on earth is the point? Do you know how much it costs? Once again, Kuenssberg asked Johnson: \u201cBut how will you do that if MPs have changed the law to stop you? Are you looking for a way round the law. Because that\u2019s what it sounds like?\u201d The prime minister again replied: We will obey the law but we will come out and we will come out, I should say, on October 31st. Kuenssberg tried yet again, asking: \u201cBut that means you are looking for a way round the law. I mean to be really clear about this, Parliament has changed the law to make it almost impossible to take us out of the EU without a deal at the end of October. But you say that you will not do it. That means that you must be looking for a way around the law?\u201d Johnson replied: Well you know those are your words. What we\u2019re going to do is come out on October 31st deal or no deal. Kuenssberg pointed out to Johnson that the European commission has said it is \u201cyet to see proposals that they think are viable and workable\u201d. Johnson responded: Well, it\u2019s certainly the case that the commission is still officially sticking on their position that the backstop has got to be there. But, clearly, if they think that we can come up with alternatives, then I think they\u2019re in the mark. I think the big picture is that the commission would like to do a deal. The prime minister has again failed to provide a clear picture of how he intends to strike a deal with the EU, despite again claiming to be optimistic he can do so. Boris Johnson was asked repeatedly by the BBC\u2019s political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, to outline the details of the proposals he has made to the European Union. Johnson said: I mean, there is a negotiation going on, has been for a long time now, about how to do this. So there\u2019s a limit to how much the details benefit from publicity before we\u2019ve actually done the deal. Kuenssberg asked him if he intended to \u201cslice and dice the backstop\u201d. Johnson replied: The shape of it is all about who decides. Fundamentally, the problem with the backstop ... is that it\u2019s a device by which the EU can continue after we\u2019ve left to control our trade laws, control our tariffs, control huge chunks of our regulation and we have to keep accepting laws from Brussels long after we\u2019ve left with no say on those laws. Now that just doesn\u2019t work. It doesn\u2019t work for the whole of the UK and it doesn\u2019t work for Northern Ireland. So we have to find a way to avoid that situation. Kuenssberg tried again, suggesting that Johnson was \u201cjust articulating the problem that\u2019s been articulated for ever about the backstop\u201d. She asked him: \u201cCan you foresee a solution, for example, where \u2013 in some areas \u2013 Northern Ireland would follow EU rules and the rest of the UK would not?\u201d Johnson replied: What we want to see is a solution where the decision is taken by the UK and clearly that\u2019s the problem with the backstop; it basically leaves the decision-making up to Brussels and that\u2019s no good. Kuenssberg tried yet again, asking the prime minister: \u201cWhat\u2019s the actual solution that you\u2019re proposing? Is it giving more power to Stormont, for example, that\u2019s being talked about a lot; that the Northern Irish assembly might be given a lock on opting out or opting in on EU regulation?\u201d Johnson replied: These are certainly some of the ideas that are being talked about and as are the ideas that you\u2019re familiar with to do with maximum facilitations, to do with checks away from the border all sorts of ways in which you can avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland. This is all doable. It\u2019s all doable with energy and goodwill. Here is the Conservative MEP Daniel Hannan on how Boris Johnson was treated in Luxembourg. That\u2019s all from me for today. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is now taking over. Hilary Benn, the Labour chair of the Commons Brexit committee, has said that Boris Johnson has just four days to publish plans for an alternative to the backstop if he is to honour a promise he made to MPs. Benn has written to Johnson asking when the plans will appear. Here is his letter. The contest to replace Ruth Davidson as Scottish Conservative leader has become another casualty of the chaos surrounding Brexit and the uncertainty around the timing of a general election. Party sources have admitted the Scottish leadership election has been postponed almost certainly until next year, as they won\u2019t have the capacity and time to stage one until both Brexit and the election are resolved. \u201cIt\u2019s genuinely a question of logistics; it\u2019s impossible to run a leadership campaign in the middle of an election campaign,\u201d said one, adding that the uncertainty at Westminster is expected within the Scottish party to drag on into 2020. That leaves Davidson\u2019s deputy, the former car dealer Jackson Carlaw, in charge. He deputised while she was on maternity leave and apparently relishes the task. \u201cHe\u2019s a happy warrior; he\u2019s one of those people who does actually enjoy it,\u201d said one party figure, who points at Carlaw\u2019s pedigree as a serial election candidate (he first stood for the party in 1982) and former Scottish party deputy chairman. Some Scottish Tories moot postponing the leadership contest until after the next Holyrood election in 2021, citing the additional challenge of opposing Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s push for an early Scottish independence vote \u2013 a push expected to intensify over coming months. A delay of that length is highly unlikely. Carlaw offers continuity, is seasoned enough to enjoy the jousts with Sturgeon at first minister\u2019s questions, and is imbued with self-confidence, but unlike Davidson has limited appeal amongvoters and little name recognition. In 2005 he apologised for making racist jokes at the party\u2019s general election manifesto launch, and has ruled himself out as a future leadership contender. In one recent interview, he described himself as being \u201cat the beginning of the dinosaur end of political life\u201d. Here are the main points from Xavier Bettel\u2019s extraordinary press conference. (See 3.31pm.) The prime minister of Luxembourg was speaking in English, but it is not his first language, and so occasionally I have tidied up his syntax just so that it reads more clearly. Bettel accused Boris Johnson of creating a \u201cnightmare\u201d of uncertainty for EU citizens by failing to clarify what he wanted from Brexit. In his opening statement Bettel said: Our people need to know what is going to happen to them in six weeks\u2019 time. They need clarity, they need certainty and they need stability. You can\u2019t hold their future hostage for party political gains. At this point, gesturing to the point where Boris Johnson would have been standing if he had joined the press conference, Bettel went on: Now it\u2019s on Mr Johnson \u2013 he holds the future of all UK citizens and every EU citizen living in the UK in his hands. It\u2019s his responsibility. Your people, our people, count on you \u2013 but the clock is ticking, use your time wisely. In this there was an echo of what Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, said when the EU granted a Brexit extension in April. \u201cPlease do not waste this time,\u201d Tusk said. Many EU leaders think the UK has wasted this time. At another point, in response to a question about a possible extension to the transition period, Bettel again said EU citizens needed certainty. He said: The fact is our citizens want to have certainty. As long as they don\u2019t know what is going to happen they don\u2019t know what will be their own future ... This is a nightmare. People would love to have clarity, they would love to know what is going to happen. He complained that Johnson had not tabled firm proposals for an alternative to the backstop. \u201cWe need more than just words,\u201d he said in his opening statement, referring to the need for a proposal in writing. And then, in the Q&amp;A, he said: The meeting was longer than planned. We [talked] about the different positions of the UK government. But I repeat \u2013 I told him, I hear a lot, but I don\u2019t read a lot. If they want us to be able to discuss anything, we need it on the written side. He said the only written text on the table at the moment was the existing withdrawal agreement. He dismissed Johnson\u2019s claim that significant progress has been made in the talks. When asked about this, Bettel replied: For me, I just have one withdrawal agreement on the table. And it\u2019s the one from last year. There are no changes. There are no concrete proposals for the moment on the table. And I won\u2019t give an agreement to ideas. We need written proposals and the time is ticking. So stop speaking, but act if you want to discuss different proposals, but we won\u2019t accept any agreement [which] goes against the single market [or] the Good Friday agreement. He mocked what was said in London about Johnson\u2019s Brexit strategy, saying that he had \u201cread in the papers a few days ago that it goes from big progress to [Incredible] Hulk to David Cameron proposing a second Brexit\u201d. Bettel suggested that, if there were a no-deal Brexit, it would take years for the two sides to reach a subsequent agreement on trade. He said he was not confident that Johnson would be able to get any deal through the House of Commons. Bettel said any Brexit deal had to protect the EU single market and the Good Friday agreement. He said the UK alone was to blame for the Brexit crisis. He and other EU leaders would not take responsibility, he said: Some people would love to give the blame to another. Not being responsible for the situation. One party, the Conservative party, decided to organise that referendum ... Now people try to blame the others because we cannot find an agreement. We did not decide to organise Brexit. It was a unilateral decision of the UK government. We have to accept the result. But it is not now in a unilateral way that the UK government will decide its next relations with the EU. We sit around the table. We have a withdrawal agreement. And this withdrawal agreement has been accepted by the UK government. I just want to repeat and remind [you] that Theresa May accepted the withdrawal agreement. So don\u2019t make it that the European Union will be the bad guy, not accepting decisions that the UK proposes ... These are homemade problems. He also said that neither he, as a European leader, nor the commission, nor the EU27 as a whole were responsible \u201cfor the mess we\u2019re in\u201d. He said he would only back an extension of article 50 if it were to serve a purpose. He said further delay was not in the interests of EU citizens. He said: Imagine you are a European citizen in London and you don\u2019t know how your future looks like. Imagine you are a UK citizen living in Europe. You don\u2019t know if tomorrow you will need a special agreement to be able to stay in the country, to be able to send your children to school. People want clarification, and as soon as possible. So to speak about new delays, just to postpone things, is not in the interests of our citizens. He said the leave campaign lied during the referendum. I just remember that, before Brexit, people said to some voters that they will get money back from social insurance, that Brexit will be done in 24 hours and everything will be good. And there were a lot of things where before the referendum no one was able to say: \u2018Sorry, this is a lie.\u2019 Bettel did not point out that Johnson led the leave campaign. But he did say there should have been a proper information campaign in the UK at the time of the referendum, so people had the facts. Bettel expressed disapproval at the hints from Number 10 that Johnson could if necessary break the law to ensure Brexit happens. When asked about that, Bettel just said: This would not happen in Luxembourg. Number 10 says the government will obey the law. But Johnson also says he would refuse to request an article 50 extension in any circumstances, even though the Benn act would make that a legal obligation, and Downing Street has not explained how these two apparently contradictory positions might be reconciled. These are from the New York Times\u2019 Matina Stevis-Gridneff. The Press Association has filed some quotes from what Boris Johnson said when he spoke to journalists in private, after the Xavier Bettel press conference. Here are the key points. Johnson claimed that \u201ca lot of work\u201d had been done on possible alternatives to the backstop. That work would now accelerate, he said: Over the last couple of weeks there\u2019s been a lot of work, papers have been shared but we are now in the stage where we have to start really accelerating the work. That was the agreement today. He said he still thought there was \u201ca good chance\u201d of the UK and the EU agreeing a Brexit deal. He said: Yes, we\u2019ve got a good chance of a deal. Yes, I can see the shape of it. Everybody could see roughly what could be done. But it will require movement. And it will require the system in which the EU can control the UK after we leave - the so-called backstop - to go from that treaty. And that needs to happen. That\u2019s a big change that we need to get done. But if we can get that done, as I\u2019ve said before, then we\u2019re at the races. He said there was \u201cjust the right amount of time\u201d available to do a deal. I think we\u2019ve got actually just the right amount of time to do a deal between now and October 17-18. But if we can\u2019t do it by then we will make sure we can come out on October 31 - deal or no deal. He implied that a no-deal Brexit could go ahead on 31 October - even though parliament has passed a law intended to stop that happening. (See above.) He rejected claims that the UK attempt to renegotiate Brexit was a shame. When this was put to him some EU leaders thought he wanted a no-deal Brexit, he replied: I don\u2019t know who you\u2019ve been talking to but that\u2019s not what our interlocutors at EU heads of government level think at all. They know that we\u2019re all working very hard to get a deal. This is a difficult moment because clearly we\u2019re very, very keen to do it but I don\u2019t want people to think it\u2019s necessarily in the bag. It isn\u2019t necessarily in the bag, there will be hard work to be done. He said that he had pulled out of the joint press conference with Bettel because of the noise. Asked what happened, he said: I don\u2019t think it would\u2019ve been fair to the prime minister of Luxembourg. I think there was clearly going to be a lot of noise. And I think our points might\u2019ve been drowned out. From the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg I\u2019ve added a correction to an earlier post because it wrongly said Luxembourg was the smallest country in the EU. In fact Malta is smaller, both geographically and in terms of population. (See 3.31pm.) Boris Johnson has recorded a clip for broadcasters. Sky News is playing it now. He says he thinks there is still time for a deal to be done. He says he thinks the UK and the EU have got \u201cjust the right amount of time\u201d to get a deal done by the end of October. If that is not possible, the UK will leave by 31 October. Johnson says UK and EU have \u201cjust the right amount of time\u201d to get a deal done by the end of October. That was extraordinary. Boris Johnson, the British prime minister, has just been humiliated by the leader of almost the smallest country in the European Union. We were expecting a joint, open-air press conference but, with a large crowd of anti-Brexit campaigners threatening to drown out Johnson, it was announced that the British PM was not going to take part (presumably because of the demonstration, although that has not officially been confirmed yet). Normally in these circumstances the polite thing to do is to rearrange. But instead Xavier Bettel, the prime minister of Luxembourg, went ahead anyway, effectively \u201cempty chairing\u201d his guest. At one point he even gestured at the space where Johnson was supposed to be. Then Bettel just let rip. People often wonder what EU leaders say or think about Johnson in private. Well, now we know. The leave campaign was a pack of lies, Johnson\u2019s talk of progress in the Brexit negotiations is unfounded, the UK still has not come up with any ideas about an alternative to the backstop. On and on he went, with particular emphasis on the point that the UK, not the EU, was to blame for the crisis. It was a \u201cnightmare\u201d for EU citizens, said Bettel. At several points he was loudly applauded by the protesters, because they felt he was articulating their anger. Yesterday, Johnson depicted himself as the Incredible Hulk. As the Telegraph\u2019s Michael Deacon suggests, the reality could not be more different. UPDATE: I\u2019ve corrected the post above because originally it said Luxembourg was the smallest country in the EU. In fact Malta is smaller, both geographically and in terms of population. Bettel says one party decided to organise the referendum. He says there was no clear information campaign in the UK explaining what Brexit would mean. He says Brexit was not the EU\u2019s decision. And he says Theresa May accepted the withdrawal agreement. These are \u201chomemade problems\u201d, he says. He says he will not accept that EU leaders, or the European commission, are to blame for what happened. And that\u2019s it. The protesters cheer as Bettel leaves. I will post a summary and a verdict soon. Q: Did Johnson say he would obey the law? He has implied he would not. Bettel replies: This would not happen in Luxembourg. Bettel says before Brexit people said to voters in the UK that they would get money back, that Brexit would happen in 24 hours, and that it would all be fine. No one called out the lies, he says. That is because people in the EU were not strong enough to say that lies were being told. Bettel accuses leave campaigners of lying during the referendum. Q: What do you think of the proposal from Stephen Barclay for the transition period to be extended? Bettel says his citizens want certainty. This is a nightmare ... Imagine you are a European citizen in London, and you don\u2019t know what the future will look like. He says speaking about new delays is not in the interests of EU citizens. Q: Do you think Brexit will actually happen? Bettel says Johnson told him there would not be a second referendum. He says his own preference is for a deal. He says he cannot guarantee whether or not Johnson can get a deal through parliament. Bettel says his meeting with Johnson took longer than planned. He says he told Johnson: \u201cI hear a lot, but I don\u2019t read a lot.\u201d He says he needs to see proposals in writing. He says the UK cannot blame the EU because they do not know how to get out of a situation they created. Bettel says he was not here to negotiate. The negotiator is Michel Barnier. Q: Did you hear any new proposals from Johnson? Do you think you are making good progress? Bettel says the only proposal on the table is the withdrawal agreement. He says the clock is ticking. The EU will not accept any proposal that undermines the Good Friday agreement. The Irish are part of the EU family, he says. Bettel says Luxembourg\u2019s priority is to protect the single market. He says the EU needs firm proposals. He says the EU will not grant another extension to the UK just for the sake of it. The UK has always been a close friend of Luxembourg\u2019s, he says. That will not change because of Brexit. But people need clarity and certainty. You cannot hold a country hostage for party political reasons. Gesturing towards the empty podium, he says the clock is ticking. Johnson needs to use his time wisely. Boris Johnson and Xavier Bettel have just left the PM\u2019s office. Bettel is speaking to the press alone. He says demonstrating is a right in a democracy. He says he wants to thank Boris Johnson. It was important to listen to Johnson, and to hear concrete proposals from him. The Boris Johnson/Xavier Bettel press conference has been cancelled, Sky\u2019s Aubrey Allegretti is reporting. It was due to take place outside the prime minister\u2019s office, and presumably the decision to shelve it had something to do with the large crowd determined to make it inaudible. (See 2.39pm.) Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, has just posted this on Twitter. Jean Asselborn is the foreign minister of Luxembourg. Here is Xavier Bettel greeting Boris Johnson earlier outside the prime minister\u2019s office in Luxembourg. And here are the protesters. Boris Johnson and Xavier Bettel are due to hold a press conference soon. There will be a live feed of the open-air venue at the top of this blog. We may not hear very much of it. There is a large crowd of protesters only a few dozen yards away, This is from the Express\u2019s Joe Barnes. And this is from the Telegraph\u2019s James Crisp. From the Telegraph\u2019s James Crisp Here is more on the anti-Johnson protests. These are from the Sun\u2019s Nick Gutteridge. Boris Johnson has arrived for his meeting with Xavier Bettel, the prime minister of Luxembourg. As my colleague Daniel Boffey reports, Johnson was booed as he arrived. Britain is unable to exert any moral authority in a world increasingly dominated by authoritarian leaders if Boris Johnson continues to threaten to break the law over Brexit, the Labour-turned-Liberal Democrat MP Chuka Umunna has argued. Here is my colleague Peter Walker\u2019s story on Umunna\u2019s speech to the Lib Dem conference. The former Conservative prime minister David Cameron has recorded an interview with ITV\u2019s Tom Bradby about his memoirs, which will be broadcast at 8pm tonight. Several extracts have already been published, and the Times published a long interview with Cameron on Saturday. You can read about those here. Here are some of the new lines from what Cameron told ITV. Cameron suggests it might have been better to speed up the cuts required under his austerity programme. Asked to defend the austerity cuts, he said: I think, look, the cuts were very difficult to make and there were lots of very difficult decisions and I\u2019m not sure we got all of them right, but I\u2019ve never wavered in the belief that it was necessary to make difficult decisions\u2026 There is a case for saying that some of the changes we had to make in year two, in year three, in year four \u2013 it might have been better if we did a little bit more a bit earlier. When you have that sort of window of permission from the public, I felt after the 2010 election, you know, we\u2019d fought an election, rather untraditionally, saying; \u2018If you elect us, we\u2019re going to make cuts and people will look back at this period and there\u2019ll be great big arguments about it.\u2019 He said Boris Johnson told him in a text message sent shortly before he publicly announced that he was campaigning for leave that he expected Brexit to be \u201ccrushed\u201d in the referendum. Asked what he thought were Johnson\u2019s motives for supporting leave, Cameron said: My conclusion is; he thought that the Brexit vote would be lost but he didn\u2019t want to give up the chance of being on the romantic, patriotic nationalistic side of Brexit. Minutes before he went out to explain why he was going to be on the side of Brexit, he sent me a text saying, \u2018Brexit will be crushed like a toad under the harrow.\u2019... but I can only conclude that \u2013 he\u2019d never argued for it before; he thought it was going to lose and that\u2019s why he made the choice. Cameron firmly ruled out out a return to frontline politics. Asked if he would ever return to frontline politics, he replied: No \u2026 I love this country. I care passionately about what happens. But I think the idea of going back to frontline politics is not going to happen, nor should it. He said Johnson\u2019s decision to suspend parliament for five-weeks would turn out to be \u201ccounterproductive\u201d. Asked if the decision to suspend (prorogue, in parliamentary jargon) was right, Cameron replied: I don\u2019t. We\u2019ll wait for what the courts say. I don\u2019t think it was illegal. It looked to me, from the outside, like rather sharp practice of trying to restrict the debate and I thought it was actually from his point of view probably counterproductive. In the end, we have to work through parliament, and you can\u2019t deny the arithmetic of parliament and the majorities there are in parliament. He said it would be \u201cdisastrous\u201d for the Conservatives if the decision to suspend the whip was not reversed. He said: I obviously disagree with the idea of taking away the whip from 21 hard-working, loyal Conservatives. I think that was a bad decision, if it isn\u2019t reversed, it will be I think a disastrous decision. I hope that Boris will get a deal in Brussels, he will come back, try and bring parliament together to back that deal \u2013 I don\u2019t see why those 21 people shouldn\u2019t be restored to the Conservative whip. If they\u2019re not, I really worry about what could happen. Contrary to what was being reported quite widely this morning, there were no snails on the menu when Boris Johnson had lunch with Jean-Claude Juncker, the BBC\u2019s Adam Fleming reports. From the Independent\u2019s Jon Stone Downing Street has now released its readout from the Juncker/Johnson lunch. A spokesperson said: The prime minister and President Juncker had a constructive meeting this lunchtime. The Brexit secretary [Stephen Barclay] and Michel Barnier [the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator] were also in attendance. The leaders took stock of the ongoing talks between the UK\u2019s team and taskforce 50. The prime minister reconfirmed his commitment to the Good Friday/Belfast agreement and his determination to reach a deal with the backstop removed, that UK parliamentarians could support. The prime minister also reiterated that he would not request an extension and would take the UK out of the EU on the 31st October. The leaders agreed that the discussions needed to intensify and that meetings would soon take place on a daily basis. It was agreed that talks should also take place at a political level between Michel Barnier and the Brexit secretary, and conversations would also continue between President Juncker and the prime minister. And this is from Jean-Claude Juncker\u2019s spokeswoman, Mina Andreeva. The European commission has just put outthis statement about the lunch. President Jean-Claude Juncker and Prime Minister Johnson had a working lunch today in Luxembourg. The aim of the meeting was to take stock of the ongoing technical talks between the EU and the UK and to discuss the next steps. President Juncker recalled that it is the UK\u2019s responsibility to come forward with legally operational solutions that are compatible with the withdrawal agreement. President Juncker underlined the commission\u2019s continued willingness and openness to examine whether such proposals meet the objectives of the backstop. Such proposals have not yet been made. The commission will remain available to work 24/7. The October European council will be an important milestone in the process. The EU27 remain united. President Juncker was accompanied by the European commission\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier. President Juncker will travel to Strasbourg later today and will address the plenary session of the European parliament on Wednesday morning. Boris Johnson was booed by people in the crowd outside as he left his lunch with Jean-Claude Juncker, the Telegraph\u2019s James Crisp reports. Boris Johnson has finished his lunch with Jean-Claude Juncker. On his way out, Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, told reporters that Juncker would be making a statement about it in due course. As Boris Johnson went in for his lunch with Jean-Claude Juncker, he was asked why he was so optimistic about the talks. \u201cCautious, cautious,\u201d Johnson replied. In a speech this morning Paschal Donohoe, Ireland\u2019s finance minister, said the British plan to abandon some EU regulations after Brexit would have significant implications for his country. Donohoe told Dublin City University\u2019s Brexit Institute that Britain\u2019s intentions were clear from the letter (pdf) that Boris Johnson sent to Donald Tusk in August. Donohoe went on: The challenges and opportunities that Ireland will face in the medium term will be heavily influenced by how far the United Kingdom decides to diverge from the European Union. While the Irish government will absolutely respect the choice of the British government to pursue a path of regulatory divergence from the EU, there are clear implications for this island and the Good Friday agreement that cannot be ignored in the event that this becomes its policy. Donohoe also said unionists should not view the backstop as a threat. It was a compromise, he said: I understand the fears that some in the unionist community have expressed about the backstop. The government takes these concerns very seriously, as we do the concerns of everyone who is troubled by Brexit and its potential impacts on both parts of our island. However, the backstop should not be viewed as a challenge to unionism. Its purpose is to provide certainty to businesses and communities on both sides of the border that they will be able to continue to operate and go about their daily lives as they do today. Nothing more. It represents a compromise - it is not the status quo. It is not the same as Northern Ireland staying in the EU. The Democratic Unionist party has for the first time signalled it is prepared to accept some post-Brexit EU rules for Northern Ireland as long as the Stormont assembly has a say, my colleague Lisa O\u2019Carroll reports. Anne Gellinek, from the German broadcaster ZDF, has a good picture of the entrance to the restaurant where Boris Johnson and Jean-Claude Juncker are meeting. Here is a translation of the key message in her tweet. Expectations: from Brit side: high from EU side: low Alexander Schallenberg, the Austrian foreign affairs minister, said this morning that, if Boris Johnson failed to present Jean-Claude Juncker with new Brexit proposals, the two sides would end up with a no-deal Brexit. These are from RTE\u2019s Tony Connelly. Peter Foster, the Telegraph\u2019s Europe editor, has posted a long thread on Twitter, which is worth reading, looking at the various possible Brexit compromises available to the UK and the EU, and how acceptable they would be to London and Brussels. It starts here. And here is his conclusion. At the Downing Street lobby briefing the prime minister\u2019s spokesperson has firmed up what Dominic Raab told Today this morning - that the government will not seek an extension to the planned 14-month Brexit transition (which, of course, would only be available in the event of the UK and the EU agreeing a deal.) See 9.46am. These are from the Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn. Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, was asked if he was confident of progress as he went in for his lunch with Boris Johnson. According to the Press Association, he replied: \u201cWe will see.\u201d According to the Telegraph\u2019s James Crisp, Juncker also offered to pay for lunch. Here is some footage of Boris Johnson meeting Jean-Claude Juncker. This is from the BBC\u2019s Larissa Kennelly. Last month Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, announced that the UK was going to start boycotting some EU meetings if it no longer saw any point in turning up. As my colleague Jennifer Rankin reports, that has happened today, at the general affairs council. Here are more pictures from Luxembourg. From Sky\u2019s Michelle Clifford From Bloomberg\u2019s Maria Tadeo Boris Johnson has arrived for his lunch with Jean-Claude Juncker. Jean-Claude Juncker has been speaking ahead of his lunch with Boris Johnson. Rather, he has come out with one of his characteristic gnomic utterances which may give us a profound insight into what he thinks about the talks process - or may tell us nothing at all. This is from his spokeswoman, Mina Andreeva. From the BBC\u2019s Adam Fleming Here is the menu, complete with typo. Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, has said that her party is in talks with other parties about standing aside in certain seats at the next general election to ensure that pro-remain candidates are elected. But Labour would not be included in such an arrangement, she told BBC Radio Scotland\u2019s Good Morning Scotland programme. As the Press Association reports, Swinson said such an agreement had worked well previously, including in the Brecon and Radnorshire byelection last month where Jane Dodds was elected as a new MP for the party. She went on: There was obviously success for that kind of arrangement in the Brecon and Radnorshire byelection. Plaid Cymru and the Green party stood aside, stood shoulder to shoulder if you like, with the Liberal Democrats and Jane Dodds was elected to be a very unequivocal voice in parliament for remain. So, that happened already and it\u2019s successful. Asked whether the party would stand aside for Labour candidates, the Lib Dem leader said: That\u2019s a different question because Labour are not a remain party, Labour are trying to deliver a Labour Brexit. But where we agree with others on stopping Brexit, we are in those discussions. This is Le Bouquet Garni restaurant in Luxembourg, where Boris Johnson is due to meet Jean-Claude Juncker for lunch. In an interview with the Today programme Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, defended her party\u2019s decision to go into the next election promising to revoke Brexit without a referendum if it won a majority. She said: I absolutely am determined that we keep our place in the EU. And I have not given up. I still believe we can stop Brexit. But Swinson would not be drawn on whether the Lib Dems would campaign to rejoin the EU if Brexit happened. The Belgian foreign minister, Didier Reynders, has said Boris Johnson needs to put forward concrete proposals for a revised Brexit deal at the European council meeting in October. Reynders said: It is very difficult to react without any concrete proposals so we will see if it\u2019s possible for Michel Barnier to receive something in the next days or in the next hours. Asked what his message was for Johnson, Reynders replied: \u201cTo come to the council and to come, maybe, with some ideas.\u201d There were two other important lines in Dominic Raab\u2019s Today interview, in addition to what the foreign secretary said about it now being time for the EU to compromise in the Brexit talks. (See 9.07am.) Raab insisted that the UK was not considering extending the planned Brexit transition period. Under the withdrawal agreement negotiated by Theresa May, there would be a transition period after the UK left the EU during which it would effectively remain bound by EU law, to allow both sides time to adjust. Originally the transition was due to last 21 months, ending in December 2020, although there was an option to extend it for a year or two. If the UK were to leave on 31 October, as the government wants, it would only last 14 months. Yesterday Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, hinted the government might want to use the option to extend. But Raab seemed to rule out the idea. He told Today: No, it is not something under consideration. This may be more wishful thinking than a firm guide to the future. The plan was for the transition to last until the UK and the EU had negotiated a future trade deal. But Phil Hogan, who has just been appointed as the EU\u2019s new trade commissioner, told the Irish Times last week that it would take him up to eight months to put a new negotiating team together. After that, negotiating a trade deal with the UK would take \u201ca number of years\u201d, he said. Even if the UK and EU were to agree a withdrawal agreement next week, it is impossible to imagine a full trade deal being completed by December next year. Raab hinted that the government would want to test the Benn Act passed by parliament with the intention of ruling out a no-deal Brexit. Asked if the government would defy the law, as some briefing from No 10 has implied, he replied: The UK government is always going to behave lawfully. I think the suggestion otherwise is nonsense. But he also claimed that the legislation was \u201cdeeply, deeply flawed\u201d. He went on: So obviously we would look at all the implications and all the variables with it ... I think the precise implications of the legislation need to be looked at very carefully. We are doing that. At the weekend Jolyon Maugham, the barrister and director of the Good Law Project who helped to organise the Scottish legal challenge against the prorogation decision, published a blogpost identifying a loophole in the act. The Finnish European affairs minister, Tytti Tuppurainen, has said the UK has still not put forward any proposals that could \u201ccompensate\u201d for the removal of the Irish backstop. Speaking as she arrived at a meeting of EU ministers in Brussels, she said: We have to remain open and see what happens in the domestic politics of the United Kingdom. Of course the European Union is always ready to negotiate when a proper proposal from the United Kingdom side is presented. So far I haven\u2019t seen any proposal that would compensate the current backstop in the withdrawal agreement. Here is my colleague Peter Walker\u2019s story about what Dominic Raab has been saying this morning. Boris Johnson goes to Luxembourg today for what might be one of the most important meetings he has had with any of his EU counterparts in his quest for a Brexit deal. He is having lunch with Jean-Claude Juncker, the outgoing president of the European commission, and although the EU October summit, which is seen by many as the place where an agreement may or may not get finalised, is more than a month away, in an article for today\u2019s Daily Telegraph (paywall) Johnson claims the next few days will be crucial in determining whether a deal can be done. He says: If we can make enough progress in the next few days, I intend to go to that crucial summit on Oct 17, and finalise an agreement that will protect the interests of business and citizens on both sides of the Channel, and on both sides of the border in Ireland. In August, Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, appeared to give Johnson a 30-day deadline to come up with an alternative to the backstop that was acceptable to the EU and would allow the two sides to reach an agreement. Twenty-six days later EU figures are complaining that the UK still has not tabled any firm plans for a backstop replacement. But, in interviews this morning, Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, insisted the EU knew exactly what the UK was proposing and that a plan had just not been tabled formally because that would become a \u201ctrap\u201d. He told Sky News: On all sides, for those that don\u2019t want a deal, or who want to put pressure on the UK, there\u2019s an attempt to elicit more and more concessions, and more and more detail, as a diplomatic pressure exercise. We are not going to fall into that trap. But I can reassure you that the details and the shape of the deal have been discussed at a political level, and Boris Johnson is out there talking to Jean-Claude Juncker today about that. They\u2019ve been discussed at technical level. Raab said it was now up to the EU to compromise. He told Sky: So this isn\u2019t about whether enough technical content has been provided. It is about whether there\u2019s the political will on the EU\u2019s side to do a deal which I still believe would be in both sides\u2019 interests. And he delivered the same message on the Today programme, when he said it was up to the EU to show \u201cpragmatism and flexibility\u201d. He said: We\u2019ve been clear [what the UK is proposing] and will continue to flesh out and respond to any questions. But of course, at some point, the EU is going to have to put up its hand and say: \u2018OK, we know that there\u2019s the requirement for some pragmatism and flexibility to get this deal over the line\u2019, because the previous deal, which I understand why they want to stick to, failed so dramatically ... I think it has come to that moment in time, as we lead into the October council, for the decisions to be made. We\u2019re willing and able to do a deal on the terms I\u2019ve described. The question now is whether the EU has got the political will to meet us to get that deal which is good for both sides. I will post more from his interviews shortly. Here is the agenda for the day. 11am: Downing Street lobby briefing. 11am: Paschal Donohoe, the Irish finance minister, gives a speech on Brexit in Dublin. 11am: Chuka Umunna, the former Labour MP who is now the Lib Dem foreign affairs spokesman, speaks at the Lib Dem conference. 11am (UK time): Boris Johnson meets Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European commission, for lunch. 1pm (UK time): Johnson holds a meeting with Xavier Bettel, the prime minister of Luxembourg. At around 2.15pm UK time they are due to hold a press conference. 4.10pm: Sir Ed Davey, the Lib Dem deputy leader and Treasury spokesman, speaks at the Lib Dem conference. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, although I will mostly be focusing on Brexit-related matter. I plan to publish a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

They are still playing catch up in a landscape that has changed almost beyond recognition - but tonight\u2019s opponents can show them the way.</p> <p>Arsenal were once England\u2019s dominant force but fell behind Chelsea and Manchester City, only to return to the summit under a canny coach, with a side that blends homegrown talent with imported star names. Joe Montemurro\u2019s team swept to the WSL title last year, and are favourites to do so again, this year.</p> <p>It\u2019s the next step in a daunting start for United, but Stoney\u2019s side showed in the narrow derby defeat to City that they are ready to compete at this level. An upset is not out of the question here, and then Manchester United really would be back on the women\u2019s football map.</p> <p>Kick-off is at <strong>7.30pm, BST </strong>at Leigh Sports Village.</p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "I\u2019ll leave you with Suzanne\u2019s report from Leigh. Thanks for joining me, and goodnight. Suzanne Wrack\u2019s match report will be online shortly, so while you wait, why not have a gander at this week\u2019s WSL talking points? It\u2019ll be very interesting to see how United fare this season. They\u2019ve been unlucky to lose against both City and Arsenal. They may prove to be the third-best team in the division - but Stoney would probably settle for mid-table consolidation in their first WSL campaign. Here\u2019s Casey Stoney: \u201cI\u2019m gutted, I thought we deserved more. To concede like that, when we\u2019ve given everything, is disappointed. I can\u2019t be anything but proud of them, they put their bodies on the line.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve created chances today, but we need to take them. We\u2019ve played the top two teams in the league, and run them close. Half of these players are new to this league, we just need to change those fine margins, and turn them in our favour.\u201d Vivianne Miedema was seen having a stern word with the referee after that game. Montemurro is keen to brush it off, saying \u201cViv\u2019s always a bit emotional after games\u201d. I didn\u2019t see any refereeing howlers, or any particular reason for Miedema to feel aggrieved. Here are the thoughts of Joe Montemurro: \u201cFirst half, we probably forced things a little bit. In the second half, we had a few opportunities, but it\u2019s about putting the ball in the back of the net, and we did in the 89th minute! This is a tough place to come to, plenty of teams will struggle here.\u201d That late winner means Arsenal are up to third, joining Everton and Manchester City with two wins out of two. The bottom two? Liverpool and Manchester United, who play each other in two weeks\u2019 time. Shoutout to Charles Antaki for basically calling it at half-time (20.28). The guy just knows. Some reaction from Kim Little: \u201cWe had to be patient, I should have scored about three goals before DVD did! She came on and made the difference. Three games, three wins, so I\u2019m proud of the team.\u201d And the goalscorer, Danielle van de Donk: \u201cIt\u2019s important to win early games, to keep up with our title rivals. I don\u2019t care who scores though, as long as we win! We want to win every prize there is, and we have the squad.\u201d And they do, with Van de Donk\u2019s late goal sealing a narrow, but ultimately deserved victory. 94 mins: James clatters into Evans, and earns a yellow card. Louise Quinn is on for Roord as Arsenal look to see this out ... 93 mins: Van de Donk commits a careless foul, allowing James the chance to lift in one more cross. Like many of United\u2019s set pieces today, it\u2019s undercooked, and Arsenal clear. 92 mins: Two of the four added minutes played. Zinsberger is booked for time-wasting, then claps the referee sarcastically. Careful now! 90 mins: Hanson almost grabs an unlikely equaliser, cutting onto her left foot and firing an effort onto the roof of the net from 25 yards! This second half has been relentless. Arsenal kept piling on the pressure, with Williamson seeing her shot blocked, before the pressure finally told. Mead\u2019s cross from the right deflected into the path of Danielle van de Donk, who prodded the ball home. That\u2019s cruel on the hosts, who have defended so well. They can\u2019t! The substitute has won it for Arsenal! 87 mins: Miedema hits the post!! This is getting silly. Faced by a wall of red shirts, Miedema picks her spot - and curls a shot against the far upright! Can United possibly hang on? 85 mins: Or will United snatch victory? Toone gets free down the left, but her cross towards Hanson is cleared behind. Corner ... and it\u2019s comfortably claimed by Zinsberger. 84 mins: The corner is cleared, then returned to the far post, where Miedema heads wide. Arsenal are dominant now, but time is against them ... 82 mins: Arsenal snuff out a United attack and break away, Little leading the charge again. She finds Evans, whose cross is intercepted. Little then wriggles into the area, only for Earps, her main rival for player of the match, to deny her at the near post! 81 mins: Arsenal corner, and a spot of head tennis before the ball lands nicely for Miedema. Her half-volley has Earps on her heels, but zips a foot over the bar! 80 mins: Ack, it\u2019s a disappointing delivery from Zelem, floating straight through to Zinsberger. 79 mins: Clever play from James, the teenager picking up on a loose pass and holding up play until Roord brings her down. The Arsenal midfielder is booked, and United have a free kick 30 yards out... 78 mins: Kirsty Hanson is on for United, replacing the impressive Sigsworth. 75 mins: Oof! Another good chance for Arsenal as Miedema plays Mead in on the right side of the area. She takes a touch, and drills a shot just beyond the far post. 74 mins: Earps gets another serenade from the crowd, with Phil Neville among them (but not joining in, we\u2019ll assume). There aren\u2019t that many keepers with their own chant, are there? 73 mins: United make their first foray forward for a while, and Hayley Ladd chests down Smith\u2019s cross before skewing an awkward shot over the bar. 71 mins: Earps\u2019 clearance is charged down by Miedema, but McManus is there to snuff out the half-chance. United have defended so well tonight. 70 mins: Mead\u2019s corner is poor, drifting beyond everyone waiting in the box. Twenty minutes for someone to grab a winner. 69 mins: Little tries another twisting run into the area, but her cross-shot is deflected behind. It\u2019s Nobbs, still making her return from a bad injury, who makes way for Van de Donk. 67 mins: Little slaloms into the United area, and has space to shoot - but Earps gets behind her shot and holds on. 65 mins: Arsenal win a free kick as Sigsworth kicks Mead in the shin - it looked accidental, but undoubtedly a foul. Can Mead find the killer ball? No. United deal with it, and Danielle van de Donk is coming on shortly. 63 mins: Little is again at the heart of Arsenal\u2019s attacking play, this time denied by Abbie McManus, who makes a fine interception. If you like lively games with no goals in them, tonight is delivering. It\u2019s Villa 0-0 West Ham in the David Cameron Derby, which Nick Ames has been watching intently: On the Human League chant: The keeper has certainly earned the love from the crowd tonight. 59 mins: More excellence from Earps, who denies Kim Little not once, but twice, from an acute angle. This could easily be 2-2, or more. 58 mins: Ross gets the hook moments after that chance, with former Arsenal academy product Lauren James replacing her. Katie Zelem gets a booking, presumably for dissent. 57 mins: And just like that, United have their best chance of the game! Sigsworth\u2019s through ball is inch-perfect and Jane Ross is in on goal - but Zinsberger stands tall to make a big save. Ross toe-pokes the ball back across goal, where Williamson hoiks clear. What a let-off for Arsenal! 56 mins: A lull. Goals please! 54 mins: A lucky bounce falls to Evans, but her cross is hurried and beyond Mead and Miedema. 53 mins: More Arsenal pressure but Earps remains solid, getting down to stop Miedema\u2019s well-struck, if central, effort on goal. 52 mins: The home fans have a chant to the tune of the Human League\u2019s \u2018Don\u2019t You Want Me?@ - can anyone enlighten me as to who or what it\u2019s about? 51 mins: United keep their shape and force Mead to try a long-range cross with her right foot. It\u2019s into the right area, but easy for Earps to come and claim. 50 mins: Williamson and Ross collide in midfield, with the United forward penalised for a shove that sent her opponent spinning. Arsenal play the ball around from the free kick ... 48 mins: Earps is off her line smartly to deny Sigsworth, almost set free behind the defence by Galton\u2019s through ball. 46 mins: Arsenal win an early corner that Mead powers into the danger zone, but Beattie can\u2019t connect. A bit of a Cup tie feel in the first half, United punching above their weight before Arsenal gained a little control. Neither side made the vital breakthrough, however. The second half is under way! \u201cOdd that van de Donk hasn\u2019t started - the Man Utd massed defence looks like it will take her sort of guile to get through,\u201d says Charles Antaki. \u201cMiedema looks a bit lonely waiting for service. 2nd half sub maybe?\u201d I think Van de Donk has likely been rested after the Champions League tie in Florence, but I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll be heading on soon enough if Arsenal can\u2019t make the breakthrough. No injury time, and a half with no goals, but plenty of intrigue. The hosts started stronger, but have Mary Earps to thank after her terrific double save from Vivianne Miedema kept the scores level. More soon. 44 mins: Little flicks a pass into Miedema, who works a yard of space to shoot. Her near-post effort is tame, and Earps gets down to collect the ball. 42 mins: ... but United are holding firm, with Little denied by a fine challenge, before Galton is penalised for a foul on Maier. 40 mins: Arsenal sense this might be their moment to strike, and push upfield ... 38 mins: The first corner is cleared behind, but from the second, Mead strikes an inside-out delivery that almost catches Earps out! She gets a fingertip to it, I think, and it clips off the bar and away from danger. 37 mins: WHAT A SAVE! Little feeds the ball left to Evans, switching sides with Mead. She gets too much time to pick out Miedema with a cross. The forward powers a header on goal, and thinks she\u2019s scored - but Earps claws it away from the near post! The keeper then leaps up to deny Miedema from the rebound ... 35 mins: Miedema is flagged offside after Lisa Evans delays her through-ball a fraction too long. In the dugout, Montemurro looks like a man waiting for his starter to arrive. 34 mins: Zinsberger comes off her line to claim a high ball into the box, in the direction of Sigsworth. Arsenal break, but Evans\u2019s cross is headed clear. The game getting a little more stretched now. 32 mins: Kirsty Smith cuts in from the left, sees space open up and keeps moving, before firing an ambitious effort at goal that\u2019s well struck, but a long way over ... 30 mins: McCabe and Little get their wires crossed as the latter tries to break into the area. It\u2019s not clicking for Arsenal yet, but you can still sense the danger. 29 mins: United win a fortunate corner from which Arsenal clear and break at speed - and Amy Turner has to execute a perfect slide tackle to keep Mead from breaking through on goal! 28 mins: Montemurro looks a little peeved on the touchline, as another attacking move fizzles out in the final third. 27 mins: Arsenal keep playing it out from the back, blissfully unaware that Norwich City destroyed that concept over the weekend. 25 mins: The hosts have edged the first 25 minutes, with Arsenal yet to test Mary Earps in the United goal. 23 mins: Sigsworth, a traditional No 9 being utilised out on the right tonight, bursts clear and swings in a far-post cross. Arsenal scramble it behind but from the corner, the ball ricochets to Toone. Her snap-shot flies over the bar. 21 mins: Amy Turner is penalised for a clumsy challenge on McCabe, but avoids a booking. A chance for Little to put a dangerous free kick into the box - but her drifting delivery is over the head of her fellow Scot, Jen Beattie. 19 mins: Ella Toone brings the ball forward, and with options left and right, opts for a highly optimistic shot from 30 yards. It flies into the empty terrace behind the goal, which is festooned with United banners. 18 mins: Amy Turner gets across to nod a long ball away from Beth Mead. Arsenal still very much in second gear, here. 16 mins: Can Arsenal punish that miss? Kim Little starts a counter-attack and McCabe swings a dangerous cross in towards Miedema, who is just crowded out. 14 mins: Ella Toone spurns the best chance of the game so far! Beattie\u2019s poor pass out from the back is picked up by Sigsworth, who motors down the right and crosses. Toone runs in, unmarked, but heads wide. 12 mins: Arsenal get a free kick inside the United half, but some valiant pressing forces them to play all the back to Zinsberger. 10 mins: Arsenal have had a long spell on the ball, pinging passes around without threatening the United defence. The hosts appear happy to sit back, for now. 8 mins: Leah Williamson is penalised for a foul on Jane Ross, but United can\u2019t make anything out of the free kick. 7 mins: Not much fluency in the early stages. Arsenal might be feeling it a bit after a long, albeit very successful, Champions League trip to Italy. 5 mins: \u2018Same old Arsenal, always cheating\u2019 is the chant from the crowd as the visitors fail to win a free kick. 4 mins: Sigsworth, the Championship\u2019s top scorer with United last season, just fails to control a long diagonal pass when well placed. 2 mins: Sigsworth does well to chase down a long pass, but can\u2019t pick out Jane Ross with her cut-back on the stretch. 1 min: Both teams starting in what looks like a 4-3-3. Galton, Sigsworth and Ross up top for United; Evans, Miedema and Mead for Arsenal. Here we go, then. United in red and white, Arsenal in yellow and navy. There\u2019s a decent crowd at the Leigh Sports Village. Incidentally, United\u2019s women\u2019s team base is the Cliff, the training ground thrust back into the spotlight by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer last season. Casey Stoney: \u201cWe know we\u2019re playing the best team in England. We need to work hard out of possession, we learnt last week we can compete, now we\u2019ll try to get something.\u201d Joe Montemurro on Jordan Nobbs, making her first start since her ACL injury last year: \u201cJordan has been playing 30, 40 minutes. This feels like the right time, let\u2019s see how she does.\u201d Catch up with this weekend\u2019s talking points - including a mention for Chloe Kelly, who left Arsenal for Everton last year and fired in an absolute rocket against Bristol City: Some pre-game reading for you: Suzanne Wrack meets Lia Walti, Arsenal\u2019s Swiss midfielder who has battled injury, and dealt with the tragic death of compatriot Florijana Ismaili, in recent months. Both sides go with attacking line-ups but both have notable absentees in the starting XI. Summer signing Jackie Groenen misses out for United with an injury, while Danielle van de Donk is on the bench for Arsenal. Manchester United: Earps; Smith, McManus, M Turner, A Turner; Galton, Zelem (c), Ladd, Toone; Sigsworth, Ross. Subs: Mikalsen, Harris, Green, James, Arnot, Hanson, Edwards. Arsenal: Zinsberger; Maier, Williamson, Beattie, McCabe; Roord, Nobbs, Little, Evans; Miedema, Mead. Subs: Peyraud-Magnin, Mitchell, Quinn, Schnaderbeck, Grant, Filis, van de Donk. For the Manchester United women\u2019s team, it has been a long and rocky road to their first ever top-flight home fixture. A supporters\u2019 side floated around the lower divisions before earning affiliation with the club in 2001 - only for funding to be pulled four years later, casting the team into oblivion. Last year, an official team was born and cantered to promotion, managed by Casey Stoney and with significant squad investment. They are still playing catch up in a landscape that has changed almost beyond recognition - but tonight\u2019s opponents can show them the way. Arsenal were once England\u2019s dominant force but fell behind Chelsea and Manchester City, only to return to the summit under a canny coach, with a side that blends homegrown talent with imported star names. Joe Montemurro\u2019s team swept to the WSL title last year, and are favourites to do so again, this year. It\u2019s the next step in a daunting start for United, but Stoney\u2019s side showed in the narrow derby defeat to City that they are ready to compete at this level. An upset is not out of the question here, and then Manchester United really would be back on the women\u2019s football map. Kick-off is at 7.30pm, BST at Leigh Sports Village.",

So being unable to punish West Ham here hurt.</p> <p>While Villa lacked precision when it mattered most, there could be no questioning their desire \u2013 at least not after an extraordinary incident in the first-half between Anwar El Ghazi and Tyrone Mings. When the defender lambasted the midfielder for not tracking back hard enough, El Ghazi responded by pushing his forehead into that of his teammate in what could easily have been construed as a headbutt, albeit not a hard one. At least the referee, Mike Dean, remained level-headed and, after a review by VAR, he let El Ghazi off with a lecture. Smith said that, while El Ghazi was out of order, his players dealt with it so well that he did not have to address it at half-time.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t need to,\u201d said the Villa manager. \u201cThere\u2019s great togetherness in the dressing room.

      "bodyText": "West Ham arrived here on a quest for the victory that would have lifted them to third in the table but they ended up relieved to take a point. They did not deserve more. Nor did Aston Villa, and that was frustrating for the hosts, who spent the last portion of the game mostly failing to trouble 10 men after Arthur Masuaku was sent off. Nearly all the home players threw themselves to the ground at the final whistle: this was an opportunity missed. Dean Smith has said since the start of the campaign that he expects home wins to form their basis for surviving, maybe even thriving, in the Premier League. So being unable to punish West Ham here hurt. While Villa lacked precision when it mattered most, there could be no questioning their desire \u2013 at least not after an extraordinary incident in the first-half between Anwar El Ghazi and Tyrone Mings. When the defender lambasted the midfielder for not tracking back hard enough, El Ghazi responded by pushing his forehead into that of his teammate in what could easily have been construed as a headbutt, albeit not a hard one. At least the referee, Mike Dean, remained level-headed and, after a review by VAR, he let El Ghazi off with a lecture. Smith said that, while El Ghazi was out of order, his players dealt with it so well that he did not have to address it at half-time. \u201cI didn\u2019t need to,\u201d said the Villa manager. \u201cThere\u2019s great togetherness in the dressing room. El Ghazi went over the edge of what we want and the players dealt with it swiftly. I\u2019m happy for them to do that.

It was fitting, then, that when Billy Vunipola appeared on stage at England\u2019s World Cup welcome ceremony he declared his World Cup wish to be that he and his teammates grow old and grey and still fondly reflect on this tournament. \u201cI wish that whatever we do in the next few weeks will live with us for the rest of our lives.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/16/rugby-world-cup-unpredictability-japan-weather\">Air of unpredictability hangs over Rugby World Cup with adaptability the key | Robert Kitson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If it was a surprise that Vunipola did not opt for what everyone in the audience expected \u2013 that England win the World Cup \u2013 it was clearly rehearsed and undoubtedly on message. It was a soundbite that points to team unity, or \u201csocial cohesion\u201d as Eddie Jones calls it, which has been among the head coach\u2019s top priorities in the buildup to this World Cup.</p> <p>Vunipola was making a wish because part of the welcome ceremony required a player to paint one eye of a traditional Japanese <em>daruma</em> doll and England\u2019s No 8 got the nod. As and when it comes true, the other eye is to be painted. That it caused much amusement among his teammates certainly suggests there is unity among these players and it must be said they do seem to be enjoying each other\u2019s company in Miyazaki.</p> <p>Maro Itoje reeled off a few sentences in Japanese at the start of his speech and Ben Youngs also took a turn on stage to receive a <em>tengu</em> mask \u2013 considered to frighten away bad spirits and therefore seen as good luck \u2013 while the event began with a bang, or lots of them during 10 relentless minutes of <em>taiko</em> martial arts drums.

      "bodyText": "Monday was a national holiday in Japan to honour the elderly. It was fitting, then, that when Billy Vunipola appeared on stage at England\u2019s World Cup welcome ceremony he declared his World Cup wish to be that he and his teammates grow old and grey and still fondly reflect on this tournament. \u201cI wish that whatever we do in the next few weeks will live with us for the rest of our lives.\u201d If it was a surprise that Vunipola did not opt for what everyone in the audience expected \u2013 that England win the World Cup \u2013 it was clearly rehearsed and undoubtedly on message. It was a soundbite that points to team unity, or \u201csocial cohesion\u201d as Eddie Jones calls it, which has been among the head coach\u2019s top priorities in the buildup to this World Cup. Vunipola was making a wish because part of the welcome ceremony required a player to paint one eye of a traditional Japanese daruma doll and England\u2019s No 8 got the nod. As and when it comes true, the other eye is to be painted. That it caused much amusement among his teammates certainly suggests there is unity among these players and it must be said they do seem to be enjoying each other\u2019s company in Miyazaki. Maro Itoje reeled off a few sentences in Japanese at the start of his speech and Ben Youngs also took a turn on stage to receive a tengu mask \u2013 considered to frighten away bad spirits and therefore seen as good luck \u2013 while the event began with a bang, or lots of them during 10 relentless minutes of taiko martial arts drums. All of the squad received their World Cup welcome medals and caps from one of their former captains and now World Rugby chairman, Bill Beaumont, who delivered a brief speech though hardly Churchillian in tone. Truth be told he was outshone by the governor of Miyazaki, Shunji Kono, who in no uncertain terms urged England to go forth and conquer. On the whole it was a low-key event, or certainly compared with Wales\u2019s open training session 200 miles to the north, but it served its purpose for the local dignitaries and, more than that, it heightened the sense of anticipation. England have been in Japan since Monday but still do not begin their campaign for days and the coaching staff have explained how the players have been straining at the leash. Itoje more than once told of how he \u201ccan\u2019t wait to get going\u201d, while Jonny May is similarly eager for the match against Tonga in Sapporo on Sunday to arrive. \u201cI\u2019ve felt ready for a little while now but it\u2019s just been a case of keeping to the process.\u201d It is a match England are expected to win comfortably \u2013 for they will have far too much firepower for the Pacific Islanders, who are expected to be physical if ultimately inferior.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Helen Sullivan bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Tuesday 17 September. Top stories Hardline anti-abortion Liberal MPs in NSW say they will move a spill motion against the premier, Gladys Berejiklian, over her handling of the abortion decriminalisation bill, which is due to be debated in the upper house today. The spill, backed by Tanya Davies, Matthew Mason-Cox and Lou Amato, comes just months after Berejiklian led the party to victory at the state election. It is unlikely the rebel MPs will have enough support to oust the premier, but religious leaders, rightwing MPs and conservative media commentators have mounted a vociferous campaign to derail the legislation. Boris Johnson has been left humiliated, with claims of progress in the Brexit negotiations in tatters, after a chaotic visit to Luxembourg that ended in the UK prime minister being mocked by a fellow European leader for cancelling a press appearance to avoid protesters. Johnson was booed and jeered as he left a working lunch with the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, before opting out of plans to speak alongside Luxembourg\u2019s prime minister, Xavier Bettel, after being targeted by a larger crowd. Australia\u2019s top chief executives continue to rake in hefty bonuses on top of their salaries, new analysis shows, despite last year\u2019s banking royal commission undermining public confidence in the business sector. The report by the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors, released on Tuesday, found that only one ASX100 chief executive who was eligible for a bonus missed out in the 2017-18 financial year \u2013 Don Meij, the head of scandal-plagued Domino\u2019s. It found that the median bonus for an ASX100 chief executive was $1.6m, the second-highest in the report\u2019s 18-year history. World New York City prosecutors have subpoenaed eight years of Donald Trump\u2019s personal and business tax returns, Associated Press has reported. A politician from Germany\u2019s far-right Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland party has walked out of an interview and threatened a journalist after he was confronted with parallels between his rhetoric and that of Adolf Hitler. Canada and its allies are scrambling to assess the damage inflicted by what experts believe could be the largest security breach in the country\u2019s history, after a senior federal intelligence official was arrested on charges of stealing covert information. James Murdoch has said there are views on Fox News \u201cI really disagree with\u201d. In an interview with the New Yorker he levied subtle but pointed criticism at his father\u2019s news network and Donald Trump. Taxpayers are providing more than $1m a minute in global farm subsidies, much of which is driving the climate crisis and destruction of wildlife, according to a new report. Opinion and analysis It\u2019s easy and convenient to solely blame Iran for the Gulf crisis, writes Simon Tisdall, as US and British officials routinely do.

My vote would go to Beany [Matthew] again next time, because everyone has enjoyed it so much. \u201cI always think that if you win you deserve the chance to go and get the trophy back again. I would encourage her to go for it. Catriona and her family might think it\u2019s way too much, it\u2019s a hell of a commitment. But it\u2019s not any of our choices, it\u2019s the board of the Ladies European Tour.\u201d Pettersen\u2019s was the ultimate Solheim Cup redemption after she was embroiled in epic controversy in Germany, four years ago. At Des Moines in 2017, Pettersen had to withdraw from the European team at the 11th hour because of a back injury. \u201cShe\u2019s gone from the villain to the hero in one fell swoop,\u201d Davies said. \u201cYou can\u2019t cover it up, that [2015 episode] changed the momentum of the Solheim Cup that time. So it\u2019s nice for her that she can come back and win the cup for us with one stroke. I loved that it came down to her. \u201cThat\u2019s why we stacked the bottom half of the singles. We wanted people there who could handle it. Bronte Law, Anna Nordqvist or Suzann, we knew one of those was going to have to win the cup for us. It just happened to be Suzann was the one who did it. Nine times out of 10 in that position she comes out on top. It\u2019s the greatest moment she\u2019s had as a Solheim Cup player. For any player, it has to be the pinnacle.\u201d",

Aged 43, he was told in July that he would no longer be required by <strong>Kent</strong> after 15 years at Canterbury. Now, after a special week, he is pretty much the first name on their team sheet and forcing a rethink.</p> <p>In a game significant only in the battle for third place in Division One, Stevens played the key role in helping Kent recover from 39 for five against <strong>Yorkshire</strong> to a preposterous 482 for eight. His career best 237 off 225 balls came hot on the heels of a first-innings 88 and 10 wickets in last week\u2019s win over Nottinghamshire and surpasses his previous best of 208 in his lengthy career.</p> <p>Stevens shared 346 with Sam Billings, who could be nominated for best supporting actor with his 138 off 209 balls. It smashed records aplenty, including the highest sixth-wicket partnership ever at Headingley after Duanne Olivier had claimed four early wickets.</p> <p><strong>Somerset</strong>, too, the Division One leaders, will be pretty happy with their day\u2019s work. While their bowlers were running through <strong>Hampshire</strong> at the Ageas Bowl, second-placed <strong>Essex</strong> were frustrated by bad light and drizzle at Chelmsford until just after 2pm. By the time Essex got going against <strong>Surrey</strong>, who closed on 137 for four, they were already under pressure having done nothing wrong. It will have been of some frustration to see Hampshire slip to 88 for seven. Hampshire recovered to 196, thanks to Liam Dawson\u2019s 103, before Somerset closed on 30 for two. </p> <p>It was a batting day at Trent Bridge, where centuries from Steven Mullaney and Joe Clarke helped relegated <strong>Nottinghamshire</strong> post 425 for six against <strong>Warwickshire</strong>.</p> <p>There were wickets aplenty in Division Two, where all five matches affect the promotion race. <strong>Northamptonshire</strong>, second in the table, restricted Durham to 37 for four in reply to 217, including Adam Rossington\u2019s 82. Third-placed <strong>Gloucestershire </strong>bowled <strong>Worcestershire</strong> out for 221 at New Road before reaching 87 for four.</p> <p><strong>Sussex</strong>, coming up on the rails, bowled their hosts <strong>Derbyshire </strong>out for 138 before replying with 116 for three. <strong>Lancashire</strong>, helped by scores elsewhere, secured the title with 259 against <strong>Middlesex</strong> and reducing the visitors to 39 for six at Old Trafford. <strong>Glamorgan</strong> closed on 300 for four against <strong>Leicestershire </strong>at Cardiff.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d7fb4cc8f08f9df5bdd57c8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-16T16:14:11.613Z\">5.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Well, with some writing up duties for the paper, that\u2019s me done for today on the blog. This game continues to amaze me. I thought I\u2019d be giving this game little prominence due to the title battle involving Somerset and Essex. How wrong I was. Darren Stevens, take a bow.

Ten wickets in the match and a first-innings 88 as Kent beat Notts last week, he is now 90 not out out and steering their recovery from 39-5. They are now 190-5 in the 48th over.

You look at the scorecards and see plenty of names you don\u2019t recognise and then others where counties have parachuted in locum overseas replacements, including two on show here at Headingley in Ajaz Patel and Faf du Plessis. Another is West Indian opener Kraigg Brathwaite, who is unbeaten on 30 for Glamorgan as they reach 98-1 against Leicestershire at Cardiff. Sam Billings has just reached 50 off 81 balls for Kent.

Is the title heading to Taunton?<br></p> <p>Nottinghamshire v Warwickshire, Trent Bridge - Something to cheer for relegated Notts. Finally! Steven Mullaney is unbeaten on 90 out of 136-2.

In the Division Two promotion race, Gloucestershire, who were third at the start of play and holding the last promotion place, have restricted Worcestershire to 47-3 at New Road, with two wickets for Ryan Higgins.

It\u2019s a bright start to the morning.

      "bodyText": "As days go, the double centurion Darren Stevens could hardly have wished for better. Aged 43, he was told in July that he would no longer be required by Kent after 15 years at Canterbury. Now, after a special week, he is pretty much the first name on their team sheet and forcing a rethink. In a game significant only in the battle for third place in Division One, Stevens played the key role in helping Kent recover from 39 for five against Yorkshire to a preposterous 482 for eight. His career best 237 off 225 balls came hot on the heels of a first-innings 88 and 10 wickets in last week\u2019s win over Nottinghamshire and surpasses his previous best of 208 in his lengthy career. Stevens shared 346 with Sam Billings, who could be nominated for best supporting actor with his 138 off 209 balls. It smashed records aplenty, including the highest sixth-wicket partnership ever at Headingley after Duanne Olivier had claimed four early wickets. Somerset, too, the Division One leaders, will be pretty happy with their day\u2019s work. While their bowlers were running through Hampshire at the Ageas Bowl, second-placed Essex were frustrated by bad light and drizzle at Chelmsford until just after 2pm. By the time Essex got going against Surrey, who closed on 137 for four, they were already under pressure having done nothing wrong. It will have been of some frustration to see Hampshire slip to 88 for seven. Hampshire recovered to 196, thanks to Liam Dawson\u2019s 103, before Somerset closed on 30 for two. It was a batting day at Trent Bridge, where centuries from Steven Mullaney and Joe Clarke helped relegated Nottinghamshire post 425 for six against Warwickshire. There were wickets aplenty in Division Two, where all five matches affect the promotion race. Northamptonshire, second in the table, restricted Durham to 37 for four in reply to 217, including Adam Rossington\u2019s 82. Third-placed Gloucestershire bowled Worcestershire out for 221 at New Road before reaching 87 for four. Sussex, coming up on the rails, bowled their hosts Derbyshire out for 138 before replying with 116 for three. Lancashire, helped by scores elsewhere, secured the title with 259 against Middlesex and reducing the visitors to 39 for six at Old Trafford. Glamorgan closed on 300 for four against Leicestershire at Cardiff. Well, with some writing up duties for the paper, that\u2019s me done for today on the blog. This game continues to amaze me. I thought I\u2019d be giving this game little prominence due to the title battle involving Somerset and Essex. How wrong I was. Darren Stevens, take a bow. Catch up soon folks. Enjoy the rest of the day. Jamie Porter and Sam Cook have two wickets apiece for Essex, who have restricted Surrey to 116-4, while Somerset are frustrated by some bad light at Hampshire. Somerset, replying to 196, are 23-2. Darren Stevens has fallen for 237, caught at deep mid-wicket off Ajaz Patel, leaving Kent at 385-6 and ending a 346-stand with Sam Billings, whose 112 not out has almost been a footnote in the day. That\u2019s how well Stevens played. That is the highest partnership in Championship cricket this season. Stevens reaches his fourth career double hundred off 202 balls. Truly remarkable. Kent are 342-5 in the 70th over. Sam Billings has reached his first hundred of the season off 157 balls with 12x4s and one six. Kent are now 334-5. Wickets falling in Division Two. Lancashire are 223-7 against Middlesex at Old Trafford, Northamptonshire are 183-8 against Durham and Worcestershire have been bowled out for 221 against Gloucestershire. Division Two continues to enthral. Hampshire are all out for 196 against Somerset, while Surrey are 58-2 against Essex. Here at Headingley, Darrenn Stevens is playing probably the best innings I\u2019ve seen all season. He is 172 not out from 292-5. He and Sam Billings have shared 253 and counting, the highest sixth-wicket stand ever posted on this ground. Darren Stevens has his first century since May 2017, off 129 balls with 12 fours and three sixes. Kent are 206-5. Meanwhile, Liam Dawson and Keith Barker are holding Somerset up in similar fashion to here. They have taken the Hampshire score from 88-7 to 156-7. Dawson has 74 of them. In Division Two, David Wiese has struck three times for Sussex to reduce Derbyshire to 75-6. Sussex coming up on the rails in the promotion race. Darren Stevens is doing all he can to win himself a new deal at Canterbury. Ten wickets in the match and a first-innings 88 as Kent beat Notts last week, he is now 90 not out out and steering their recovery from 39-5. They are now 190-5 in the 48th over. Sam Billings is 67 to boot. Play is due to start any moment now at Chelmsford, where Surrey have won the toss and elected to bat against second-placed Essex, who have done nothing wrong but are immediately on the back foot given Somerset\u2019s dominance of Hampshire (135-7). Century for captain Steven Mullaney, back in the side for Notts over the last couple of rounds after his mid-season knee injury. He is 121 not out, with Notts 186-2 against Warwickshire at Trent Bridge. I often think this is a wonderful, but weird, stage of the season in Championship cricket. You look at the scorecards and see plenty of names you don\u2019t recognise and then others where counties have parachuted in locum overseas replacements, including two on show here at Headingley in Ajaz Patel and Faf du Plessis. Another is West Indian opener Kraigg Brathwaite, who is unbeaten on 30 for Glamorgan as they reach 98-1 against Leicestershire at Cardiff. Sam Billings has just reached 50 off 81 balls for Kent. They are now 159-5. Around the grounds. The majority of games have reached lunch\u2026.. Division One Essex v Surrey, Chelmsford - A delayed start due to bad light and drizzle is frustrating title-chasing Essex. Hampshire v Somerset, Ageas Bowl - What a morning for the league leaders Somerset, who have restricted Hampshire to 75-6, including three wickets for Lewis Gregory. Is the title heading to Taunton? Nottinghamshire v Warwickshire, Trent Bridge - Something to cheer for relegated Notts. Finally! Steven Mullaney is unbeaten on 90 out of 136-2. Joe Clarke is 32 not out as a torrid personal summer comes to a close. Yorkshire v Kent, Headingley - Early success for Yorkshire saw Kent slip to 39-5, including four wickets for Duanne Olivier. Kent have since reached lunch on 112-5. Sam Billings has 33 and Darren Stevens 51. He reached his fifty with a straight six. Division Two Derbyshire v Sussex, County Ground - A delayed start, but Derby are 34-1 in the 10th over against promotion hopefuls Sussex. Glamorgan v Leicestershire, Cardiff - A solid start for the Welsh county, who remain in the promotion picture despite a recent wobble in form. They are 82-1. Lancashire v Middlesex, Old Trafford - Lancashire need a maximum of five points for the title. They are 92-3. Northamptonshire v Durham, Wantage Road - Both sides can go up, so this is a key fixture. Northants 75-1. Ben Curran, brother of, is 22 not out. Worcestershire v Gloucestershire, New Road - Gloucester are another county in the promotion shake-up. Worcester, who aren\u2019t but were expected to be back in April, are 63-4. An early lunch has been taken at Chelmsford due to \u201cpoor visibility\u201d. In the Division Two promotion race, Gloucestershire, who were third at the start of play and holding the last promotion place, have restricted Worcestershire to 47-3 at New Road, with two wickets for Ryan Higgins. The fact he signed a long-term deal to remain with the county recently is a huge thing for them. Hampshire six down (63-6), with Aneurin Donald the latest to go to Josh Davey. Here at Headingley, Sam Billings and Darren Stevens have steadied things somewhat. They have shared 43 to take Kent to 82-5. Stevens, particularly, hasn\u2019t been afraid to play his shots. He hasn\u2019t been gung-ho by any stretch, but there\u2019s definitely a hint of \u2018there might be one with my name on it\u2019 about his batting. Two wickets in as many overs for Middlesex at Old Trafford courtesy of James Harris and Miguel Cummins. They have removed openers Alex Davies and Keaton Jennings respectively, and Lancashire are 49-2. I heard a great tale from Old Trafford last week. John Gwynne, their PA announcer and he of Sky Sports darts coverage fame, ended up announcing Billy Godleman\u2019s fifty off ONE HUNDRED AND EIGGGGHHHHTTTTYYY balls! There is still no word of a start at Chelmsford, where around an hour ago Essex, via their Twitter account, reported bad light and light drizzle. There are still no wickets in Division Two either. Here at Headingley, Kent are 54-5, while Hampshire are 32-5 against Somerset. Relegated Notts have made a healthy start against Warwickshire at Trent Bridge, with Durban-born debutant Ben Compton bowled by Will Rhodes - 62-1. Steven Mullaney has 53 of them. Gary Naylor has published his weekly take on all things county cricket: Crikey. Hampshire are 18-4 against Somerset. Sam Northeast and James Vince have fallen to Lewis Gregory. In the meantime, it\u2019s a delayed start between Essex at Surrey at Chelmsford due to bad light. There has yet to be a wicket in Division Two. Solid starts with the bat for Glamorgan, Lancashire and Northamptonshire. That battle is won by Duanne Olivier, who bowls his former international captain for a four-ball duck through the gate. Leg-stump is rocked back, and Kent are 8-3. Hampshire are also 10-2 at the Ageas Bowl, with Josh Davey bowling Tom Alsop. Elsewhere around the country, it\u2019s been a fairly quiet start, with a few delayed starts due to bad light and damp outfields. Duanne Olivier has removed Zak Crawley and Ollie Robinson in the third over, both trying to leave alone. Crawley was lbw and Robinson caught behind off an under edge. Kent are 8-2 after three overs, and it\u2019s now a battle between the South Africans, Olivier and Francois du Plessis. Early success for the Division One leaders at Hampshire, who are 1-1 after an over having elected to bat first upon winning the toss. Felix Organ has been caught at first slip, trying to force off the back foot, against Lewis Gregory. Somerset are up and running. Good morning from Emerald Headingley for the penultimate round of the season. It\u2019s a bright start to the morning. The sun is yet to burn through, but we\u2019re all set to get going at 10.30am BST. The drama of the international summer may have finished, but there\u2019s plenty more to come in the last fortnight of Championship action across the two divisions. This round will provide a mixture of games which mean everything and others which are more of a fact-finding mission. Here at Headingley for example, Yorkshire will hand a debut to 17-year-old top order batsman Matthew Revis given Will Fraine is on the sidelines having dislocated his knee last week. The White Rose v Kent is nothing more than a battle for third place, so it seems a bit strange that both counties are fielding overseas debutants. New Zealand left-arm spinner Ajaz Patel is playing for Yorkshire, while South Africa captain Francois du Plessis is making his red ball bow for Kent having played for them in the recent T20 Blast. The only Division One matches which contribute to prizes are those involving title rivals Somerset and Essex. Leaders Somerset travel to face Hampshire at the Ageas Bowl holding an eight-point lead over Essex in second, who host outgoing champions Surrey at Chelmsford. Bottom side and relegated Nottinghamshire face Warwickshire at Trent Bridge. The weight of \u2018live\u2019 matches comes in Division Two, without a doubt. Runaway leaders Lancashire are promoted and require a maximum of five points from their home clash with Middlesex to secure the title. But, realistically, there are five other teams chasing the other two promotion places. With 48 points available during the next two weeks, Northamptonshire are second on 161 and Glamorgan are sixth on 136. Gloucestershire, Durham and Sussex are sandwiches in between. Even Middlesex, Derbyshire and second-bottom Worcestershire aren\u2019t mathematically out of the equation for a top three finish, but it would take something remarkable to see them playing in the top flight in 2020. Derbyshire host Sussex at Derby, Leicestershire visit Cardiff to tackle Glamorgan, Northamptonshire host Durham at Wantage Road and Gloucestershire have made the short trip up the M5 to New Road to face Worcestershire. It\u2019s going to be a hectic and no doubt nervous four days, and it wouldn\u2019t even surprise me to see a contrivance or two along the way. Enjoy the day and the next few as well.",

I believe in the character.\u201d</p> <p>And so he should: it\u2019s his life\u2019s work. Delaney is 64 now, and \u2013 chatting at his publicist\u2019s HQ before another UK tour \u2013 he\u2019s looking good on it. A gentle chap with a naive air about him, he\u2019s grown into Arthur, whom he dreamed up in the 80s. Delaney was studying at Central School of Speech and Drama, and needed an act for a circus-themed cabaret. Arthur was a sort-of strongman competing with Dracula to take bites out of a Bible. \u201cIt was very embryonic,\u201d Delaney recalls. \u201cHe had the voice I used to lapse into anyway when I was arsing about. With this act, I was arsing about in a circus, so I just used that voice.\u201d</p> <p>And what a voice it is. Northern (Delaney\u2019s from Leeds, the son of a foundryman and a seamstress), wheedling, malaprops a-go-go. \u201cI didn\u2019t get wherever I am by not knowing where I am.\u201d \u201cIf this turns into a full bowl of cashews, it could chiropidise the whole show.

That defence mechanism is big up north. It was prolific in my family.\u201d It makes for great comedy. \u201cEveryone likes that Arthur says what he thinks. Immediately. It goes through no filter.\u201d</p> <p>But beyond the cantankerousness, the Count is indomitable. \u201cHe\u2019s a great optimist. He\u2019s always on the lookout for the next thing. \u2018We\u2019ll get three of those, and I\u2019ll set a market stall up.\u2019 I love that about him,\u201d says Delaney, \u201cperhaps because it\u2019s unlike me.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jDuzugU2Jc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8jDuzugU2Jc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jDuzugU2Jc\">Watch a trailer for the BBC TV series</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>And yet, it took initiative for Delaney to make a success of the Count. He was a bit-part actor in the 80s (Juliet Bravo, All Creatures Great and Small), and a joiner on the side. The jobs overlapped: he was sitcom star Geoffrey Palmer\u2019s carpenter of choice. Not until 15 years after drama school did he revive the Count for the comedy stage \u2013 after which instant success, he quit acting immediately. \u201cAt drama college,\u201d he says now, \u201cI learned that I wasn\u2019t versatile. I didn\u2019t have the application you need to change what you do every time you do something. If I had a performance in me, it was about homing in on something in a very meticulous way.\u201d</p> <p>And that\u2019s what Delaney did \u2013 far from well-trodden comedy paths. \u201cI would hire venues. I\u2019d put my own evenings on. I\u2019d virtually print the tickets myself.\u201d After six years, he quit carpentry too, and Arthur \u201cbecame my living. I come from a generation where you have to have a job. And Arthur\u2019s my job; that\u2019s very much how I treat it.\u201d Even today, he professes no interest in taking on other roles. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in being an actor\u201d \u2013 unlike Steve Coogan, say, to whose Alan Partridge the Count is often compared. But really, there\u2019s no analogy to be drawn, no other comic who\u2019s dedicated a lifetime to just one character.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7f791839f01368d4ba0875369480546b1e89e363\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7f791839f01368d4ba0875369480546b1e89e363/0_0_5500_3667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018There are no other characters that could have come out of me\u2019 \u2026 Steve Delaney.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018There are no other characters that could have come out of me\u2019 \u2026 Steve Delaney.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But why <em>this </em>character? \u201cThere are no others that could have come out of me,\u201d says Delaney. \u201cThey say write about what you know. Well, when I was a kid in the 60s, a lot of stuff on TV was transitioning from the collapse of variety theatre. Light entertainment was fantastic: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Haynes\">The Arthur Haynes Show</a>, <a href=\"https://www.britishclassiccomedy.co.uk/thearmygame\">The Army Game</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootsie_and_Snudge\">Bootsie and Snudge</a>. And I place Arthur right on that transition period.\u201d It\u2019s a moment laced with melancholy; Count Arthur has a dark side. \u201cWhen music hall was breathing its last gasp is when Arthur started getting into it. Beautifully mistimed. So he\u2019s always been chasing it.\u201d</p> <p>Of course, whether Arthur really was a vaudevillian, or only ever performed in the music hall of his own mind, is moot. \u201c[TV producer] <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoff_Posner\">Geoff Posner</a> once told me I should map out everything Arthur\u2019s ever done. His backstory, in effect. So I went home and got out my pen and notepad. And I don\u2019t think I wrote a line.\u201d That\u2019s not how the character works. \u201cIt would place too many restrictions on his flights of fancy. I deliberately don\u2019t answer those questions. Arthur goes on about how he was in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2010/oct/15/bridge-river-kwai-digital-restoration\">The Bridge </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2010/oct/15/bridge-river-kwai-digital-restoration\">on the River Kwai</a>: I don\u2019t know if he was or not. Maybe he just really resents Alex Guinness.\u201d He pauses, Arthur-like. \u201cOr is it Alec Guinness? Even I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s called.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>For me, there's nothing funny in coming up with a character with dementia. I steer clear of it. He's a nutty old bloke</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Delaney won\u2019t be drawn on whether the forgetful Count is a portrait in senility rather than mere dottiness. \u201cI steer clear of it. For me, there\u2019s nothing funny in coming up with a character with dementia. The best way I can describe Arthur is, he\u2019s a nutty old bloke. In the way people were allowed to be nutty when I was a kid. \u2018Don\u2019t go near him, he\u2019s mad.\u2019 People don\u2019t grow old in the same way any more. Mind you,\u201d he says, \u201ceven when he was young, Arthur was like that.\u201d</p> <p>At any rate, the character\u2019s variety roots show in his stage work, where routine after routine (the ventriloquist\u2019s Egyptian dummy; his lederhosen-clad Sound of Music tribute; or the silent comedy set-piece in which his stooges dress him as Sherlock Holmes) would grace the end of any pier. Then there are the moments that splice hilarity with agony \u2013 like the Count\u2019s caterwauling rendition of Bill Withers\u2019 Lovely Day in his last show <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/may/28/count-arthur-strong-london-palladium-review\">The Sound of Mucus</a>. Playing Arthur for two-and-a-half hours on stage \u2013 clenched, inflexible, barking \u2013 looks like a physical endurance test. Is it?</p> <p>\u201cI never feel that, no. I know it\u2019s hard: I was dizzy at the end of Lovely Day, wobbling around. But if Arthur would be on his knees at the end of it, then I want to be on my knees as a performer. It might hurt in the moment, but not after the show. And besides,\u201d he says, \u201cthose moments people call excruciating, I love them.\u201d</p> <p>There may be fewer of them these days \u2013 although Delaney insists he never toned down the character. \u201cSome fans of the radio show didn\u2019t like the TV show, and thought it was a watered-down version. But to me, they\u2019re just different stories, different sides of Arthur \u2013 but the same approach from me.\u201d Whatever the approach, it\u2019s secured for Delaney an audience far wider than he expected. \u201cWhen I was at the London Palladium, doing pantomime,\u201d he tells me, \u201cI was having a chat with Bobby Davro. And he said to me, \u2018You are mainstream. You sell venues out\u2019.\u201d Delaney was puzzled by this then, and still is. \u201cI like doing things on my own terms too much. I don\u2019t regard what I do as mainstream at all.\u201d</p> <p>But what\u2019s thrilling about Count Arthur\u2019s success is it proves you can be both. Experimental and popular. Eccentric and mainstream. Successful, and diffident about success. In the Count\u2019s case, that success shows no signs of waning, with new TV projects in development (on which he is sworn to secrecy), a foray into publishing (with semi-coherent thriller Codename Rattlesnake) and a new tour (Is There Anybody Out There?, about stargazing) all in the pipeline. Of the latter, Delaney tells me: \u201cI\u2019m itching to perform again as Arthur now. I\u2019ve spent enough time writing as him, I need to get out there and do it. You always think, \u2018I wonder if I can still do it?\u2019 \u2013 and I know the answer to that question, of course I do. But I enjoy having to prove it.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.countarthurstrong.com/events/\">Count Arthur Strong: Is There Anybody Out There? is touring</a> from 18 September. </p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "Investors in an aborted Gavin Woodhouse care home project are to vote on whether the embattled entrepreneur\u2019s former business partner is attempting to \u201cbuy them off at a pittance\u201d via a new settlement offer. The October vote will give investors the chance of accepting 11p for every pound they ploughed into a single off-plan development in Yorkshire, where the advertised care home never materialised. MBI Walsden Care Ltd raised \u00a35.8m from investors in 2014, but the cash has now vanished from the firm\u2019s bank account. On Monday, Judge Mark Mullen ruled that Robin Forster, the sole director of the Woodhouse-owned company, could offer investors a vote on his proposal next month, rather than the company being taken immediately into administration. Mullen said: \u201cWhat [MBI Walsden investors] will wish to do is form a view if this relatively small return is something they want to accept at this stage or if they want a much more rigorous investigation that may lead to a higher return. \u201cIt is for the creditors of this company to be given the ultimate say on if \u2026 this is an attempt to buy them off at a pittance.\u201d The ruling came after the June publication of an undercover investigation by the Guardian and ITV News, which posed questions about the business interests of Woodhouse, who raised more than \u00a380m from private investors to build care homes and buy hotels, but whose firms have a multimillion-pound \u201cblack hole\u201d. A string of Woodhouse companies were then placed into administration during the summer, with the insolvency firm Duff &amp; Phelps taking over the running of the companies. MBI Walsden was spared this fate after its sole director Forster promised the high court he would not dissipate the firm\u2019s assets. On Monday Forster asked the court to delay Duff &amp; Phelps taking over the running of MBI Walsden to allow investors to consider his company voluntary arrangement, an insolvency process that allows struggling companies to agree to a deal to alleviate their financial problems, assuming creditors holding at least 75% of the debt agree. Through his counsel, Matthew Bradley, Forster described Duff &amp; Phelps\u2019 application to take control of MBI Walsden as \u201cdesperate\u201d and that the insolvency firm\u2019s evidence \u201cover reached\u201d. Judge Mullen said: \u201cIt does appear to be clear that the MBI group of companies have, in an egregious manner, failed to safeguard client monies. \u201cI think there is some force in [Duff &amp; Phelps\u2019] submissions as to the extent to which Mr Forster seeks to distance himself from the conduct of Mr Woodhouse. He essentially appears to admit in his narrative to a breach of fiduciary duty to the company in allowing Mr Woodhouse to operate the [company bank] account without reference to him. \u201cNonetheless, it seems to me that this is a matter for the creditors of the companies.\u201d Forster says he was unaware how Woodhouse had been running shared businesses and that his own company, Qualia Care, is unconnected to Woodhouse. Duff &amp; Phelps\u2019 applications to take four more Woodhouse firms into administration \u2013 Giant Hospitality, Campus House, Ideal Rooms and Ideal Management \u2013 were granted. Woodhouse, who has denied any wrongdoing, wrote to the court to say he neither consented to or opposed the applications.",

      "bodyText": "Pawnbroker Albemarle &amp; Bond has been criticised for \u201cwoefully inadequate\u201d communication with customers hoping to retrieve belongings after the company shut its shops and website last week. The National Pawnbrokers Association (NPA), the UK trade body of which Albemarle &amp; Bond is a member, said it was receiving hundreds of calls a day from worried customers who had been unable to get through to a helpline set up by the pawnbroker. Ray Perry, chief executive of the NPA, said there were only 10 people working in Albemarle &amp; Bond\u2019s contact centre and they had been overwhelmed by demands for information. He said: \u201cThe industry is not impressed and we are quite angry about this. The provision made is clearly woefully inadequate and the information sent out is quite contradictory in places.\u201d He said that Albemarle &amp; Bond\u2019s directors, who include Kohei Ogawa, a council member of the trade body, had not responded to attempts to contact them. A&amp;B and fellow chain Herbert Brown, which are owned by Oxford-based Speedloan Finance, closed all 116 UK shops last week. A statement on A&amp;B\u2019s website said the pawnbroker had ceased trading. Speedloan Finance, which employed 391 people at the end of 2018, later said in a statement that it had \u201cinformed its employees that due to the ongoing economic environment resulting in significant losses\u201d, as of 12 September it has closed all its stores and is exploring options available to it, such as finding a buyer for some or all of the stores. It said: \u201cSpeedloan is due to enter into a period of consultation with employees concerning its proposal and has in the meantime offered its employees voluntary redundancy.\u201d The company, which is ultimately owned by listed Japanese pawnbroking firm Daikokuya Holdings, said it had centralised the operation of its loan and pledgebook operation to its central distribution centre in Oxfordshire to \u201cminimise the impact on customers\u201d. The pawnbroker\u2019s Facebook page is filled with comments from unhappy customers including Kiran Kiran who said: \u201cWhat\u2019s going on about the Coventry branch?

But according to Hurley, problems could arise as it was not possible to stockpile short-life products such as fresh produce. \u201cI can\u2019t guarantee there won\u2019t be shortages in some products. No one in the industry can guarantee that so we\u2019re not alone. Our focus is on shielding customers the best we can.\u201d He said the retailer was shaking up the British grocery market with its promise to be significantly cheaper than mainstream rivals who had been forced to \u201csharpen their game\u201d. Aldi\u2019s figures were published as Asda revealed a 3.2% rise in sales to \u00a322.9bn and near 13% rise in pre-tax profits to \u00a3804.9m for the year to 31 December 2018. The company said sales at established stores were up 1.6% for the year as it had cut prices and improved availability of fresh foods. Accounts filed at Companies House also showed a 5,765 fall in the number of staff employed by the group in the past year, helping to cut the group\u2019s wage bill by more than \u00a338m. Asda recently revealed a 0.3% fall in underlying sales in the first half of 2019. The supermarket\u2019s chief financial officer, Rob McWilliam, said: \u201cThe challenges faced in the market during 2018 have only intensified as we move through 2019.\u201d Aldi lowered prices in the past year as it responded to reductions by rivals including Tesco, Asda and Sainsbury\u2019s. Hurley said the chain would always maintain a significant price gap with the big chains as part of an \u201cunbreakable contract\u201d with customers. Aldi is focusing on opening stores in London, where it has 45. It aims to have 100 by 2025 and potentially 250 within the M25 in the longer term, about 50 of which could be in the group\u2019s new small format. These are, on average, only about 600 sq metres (6,400 sq ft), just under half the size of a typical Aldi. \u201cOur market share is only 3.4% in London compared to 8.1% nationally,\u201d said Hurley, \u201cClearly there is a significant opportunity.\u201d Stores are planned in Sydenham, Blackheath and Watford in the coming year.",

      "bodyText": "Friends and colleagues of Dr Kylie Moore-Gilbert \u2013 the Australian woman sentenced to a decade in prison in Iran on suspected espionage charges \u2013 have praised her as a \u201cthoughtful and passionate academic\u201d, and rejected outright suggestions she was a spy. The British-Australian academic was arrested by the Iranian regime in September last year and has since been tried and sentenced to 10 years in prison. The charges are not publicly known, but it is believed they relate to espionage: 10-year sentences are regularly handed down for spying in Iran. Moore-Gilbert is currently being held in Tehran\u2019s notorious Evin prison, reportedly in solitary confinement. She has had limited consular access from Australian officials, and no contact with her family or friends. Moore-Gilbert is a lecturer in Islamic studies at the University of Melbourne\u2019s Asia Institute. George Rennie, lecturer in politics and lobbying at the University of Melbourne, condemned her arrest by the Iranian regime. \u201c\u2018Humble\u2019 doesn\u2019t quite do Kylie justice. She was a thoughtful and passionate academic. This is a disgusting reflection on the Iranian dictatorship,\u201d he said online. David Malet, assistant professor at the American University\u2019s School of Public Affairs, said he was distraught to learn on Moore-Gilbert\u2019s solitary confinement and her prison sentence. \u201cI served on Kylie\u2019s dissertation committee. She\u2019s a wonderful person and a serious scholar, not a spy.\u201d Both the British and Australian governments have been trying to keep the identities of their arrested citizens out of the public domain, believing diplomatic efforts to have them released would be more effective if conducted behind closed doors, but others have argued putting a \u201cpublic face\u201d on those detained will help generate international community and political support, providing further impetus for Iran to negotiate over their release. Some professional acquaintances did not know Moore-Gilbert been detained. Enrica Fei, a PhD candidate at the Bundeswehr University in Munich, met Moore-Gilbert at a conference last year, describing her as \u201ca lovely, humble woman and bright academic\u201d . \u201cI wondered for months why she\u2019d stopped replying to my emails and never met in the UK, as we\u2019d agreed.\u201d In an intervention less likely to soothe diplomatic tensions, US president Donald Trump\u2019s lawyer Rudy Giuliani berated the Iranian regime as terrorists in a post on Twitter. \u201cDr Kylie Moore-Gilbert, the third foreign national revealed this week to be imprisoned in Iran. Arrested, charged, and convicted for undisclosed actions. Sentenced to 10 YEARS without any public record of a trial! These are typical actions of the Ayatollah\u2019s #REIGN OF TERROR!\u201d Moore-Gilbert\u2019s research has drawn her into areas that could be perceived \u2013 particularly by an Iranian regime under acute pressure from economic sanctions and deeply suspicious of foreign academics and journalists \u2013 as sensitive. She has written extensively about revolutions and activism in the Middle East, with a particular focus on Shia Islam, Bahraini politics and its protest movements. Moore-Gilbert\u2019s most recent publications have been journal articles and book chapters on Bahrain\u2019s \u201cFebruary 14\u201d pro-democracy youth movement and online opposition activism during Bahrain\u2019s post-Arab Spring crackdown. At the time she was arrested she held a grant examining \u201cIran\u2019s relationship with Bahrain\u2019s Shia after the Arab uprisings\u201d. The grant was part of the University of Melbourne\u2019s early career researcher grants scheme. Moore-Gilbert was dux of All Saints College in Bathurst 2005 and graduated from Cambridge University with honours in Middle Eastern studies in 2013. She finished her PhD in Gulf politics at the University of Melbourne in 2017. Two other Australians are currently being held in Evin prison. British-Australian woman, Jolie King, and her Australian boyfriend Mark Firkin were arrested 10 weeks ago near the capital. They have not yet been tried. It is understood the pair were flying a drone \u2013 to shoot pictures for a travel blog \u2013 near to military installations in Jajrood in Tehran province. The couple left their home in Perth, Western Australia, in 2017, documenting their travels on a blog called The Way Overland. They planned to drive from Perth to London, documenting their travels for an online travelogue on YouTube and Instagram. Dozens of videos and photographs posted online appear to have been shot using a drone. While news of the trio\u2019s incarcerations only surfaced in the last week, Australia\u2019s foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, said she has raised their cases \u201cmany times\u201d with her Iranian counterpart, Mohammad Javad Zarif. The ministers met and discussed the cases as recently as this month, Payne told parliament. Payne has denied the arrests were politically motivated, although commentators have speculated the trio may be being held as \u201cbargaining chips\u201d, giving Iran political leverage on a number of ongoing disputes with the western countries, particularly over oil sanctions. \u201cWe have no reason to think that these arrests are connected to international concern over Iran\u2019s nuclear program, United Nations sanction enforcement or maritime security concerning the safety of civilian shipping,\u201d Payne said. A fourth Australian is currently unable to leave Iran, though not imprisoned. Dual Iranian-Australian citizen Meimanat Hosseini-Chavoshi, was arrested in December last year as she attempted to leave Iran. A population expert affiliated with Melbourne University\u2019s School of Population and Global Health, Hosseini-Chavoshi was charged with trying to infiltrate Iranian institutions. The Guardian understands Hosseini-Chavoshi has been released on bail but is unable to leave the country while her case progresses through the criminal justice system.",

      "bodyText": "Trying to discern the direction of the world economy is a job fraught with danger, but there are clear signs that its weakening is having an impact on Australia despite the more positive outlook on the US economy. For much of the past three months, the focus on the US economy has been around US Treasury bond yields and the fact that the yield curve went \u201cnegative\u201d. As I have noted in the past, this is when the bond yield (or interest rate) for long-term bonds (such as 10 year or 20 year bond) is lower than for short-term bonds \u2013 anything under two years. Since the middle of May, the yield for a one-month Treasury bond has been higher than for a 10-year bond. This means investors believe interest rates will fall over the next 10 years relative to where they are now. And given interest rates falling is something that occurs when the central bank feels the need to stimulate the economy, a negative bond yield curve has been a pretty good predictor of a recession: But in the past week the yield for US 10-year Treasury bonds rose dramatically as the markets began to get less worried about Trump\u2019s trade war with China. The big issue with the negative yield curve this time is that while it is not a good sign for the economy, it is largely a man-made stuff up \u2013 and that man is Donald Trump. Should the clown in chief of the US work out a way of making a deal with China that essentially sees a return to the status quo, which he would no doubt spruik as some sort of triumph, then the US economy should mostly just carry on. The markets are becoming more hopeful that this will occur, given it has inevitably been the path of Trump\u2019s economic policies \u2013 make a big noise about undoing everything, and after it turning out horribly, getting a couple of trivial concessions that allow him to claim victory. But there are signs that the world economy has hit some speed bumps that have had a real impact on Australia\u2019s economy \u2013 and they can be seen directly in the number of visitors coming to our shores each month. Coming to Australia is a big trip for anyone from the northern hemisphere. To come here on a trip suggests the financial conditions are favourable due to our exchange rate, and that people feel financially solid enough to pay for it. At the moment, our exchange rate is as favourable for inbound tourists as it has been for over a decade: With the value of our dollar at US$0.68, a US tourist gets A$1.47 for every US dollar. That makes for a cheap trip. The Australian dollar over the past year has fallen against the major currencies of the Japanese yen, the Chinese yuan, and the euro: We have in effect become a cheaper destination for people to visit. And yet over the past year the number of short-term visitors to Australia has grown by just 3.4% \u2013 the slowest annual growth for six years: The slowdown has been most pronounced with visitors from China, which is our biggest tourism market. In the past 12 months around 1.45 million people visited Australia from China \u2013 nearly 16% of all short-term arrivals. But that was just 1.2% above the previous year \u2013 the slowest growth since the GFC period: There has been a nice pick-up in the number of Japanese arrivals, clearly taking advantage of the very strong yen. But we have also seen a very quick drop in the growth of tourists coming from the US. While the US numbers look to be improving, they account for just over half of the number who come from China: The weakness in the Chinese economy is clearly having an impact on tourism numbers to Australia. It is also likely that the current tensions between Australia and China over the US-China trade war and other issues such as the South China Sea are having an impact. The economic news from overseas is generally poor \u2013 the Brexit issue and concerns within the EU have seen a marked slowing of the European economy, and the China-US trade war is hurting both nations for little purpose. While Australia remains a long way from having to worry about a recession, our economy is not immune from international troubles \u2013 indeed, as a small, open economy we are strongly affected. The tourist industry is one of the sectors of the economy most vulnerable to economic changes. A weakening domestic economy can see a slowing of Australians spending money on holidays, and a weakening world economy sees a drying up of international tourists. At the moment our weak exchange rate should make Australia an enticing destination, and yet the growth of tourists from overseas is slowing dramatically. It highlights that the problems our economy faces should not be understated, and that Australian households are not the only ones struggling with slowly growing living standards. \u2022 Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist",

The Morrison government wants to repeal the medical evacuation procedures imposed on the Coalition by the crossbench, Labor and the Greens during the period of minority government before the May election. The procedures give clinicians more of a say in whether sick people are transferred from Nauru and Manus Island to Australia for medical treatment. Despite strenuous objections from a range of stakeholders, the medevac repeal legislation has already passed the House of Representatives and is now subject to an inquiry by the Senate\u2019s legal and constitutional legislative committee with a report date of 18 October. The government recently flagged bringing the repeal vote forward to the September parliamentary sitting rather than waiting until the conclusion of the Senate inquiry, but was warned off that course of action by the critical Senate kingmaker, Jacqui Lambie, who declared the government needed to use its \u201cbloody manners\u201d and wait until later in the year rather than attempting to crash through. The latest Guardian Essential survey suggests voter support for the medevac regime is currently about the same as it was in February this year despite the government contending regularly in partisan messaging that the procedures are harmful to border security. Public perceptions that the legislation will weaken Australia\u2019s borders and result in boats arriving have decreased since the start of the year from 30% to 21%. At the same time, concerns from voters that the medevac regime does not go far enough to provide humane treatment for people in offshore detention has increased from 15% in February to 23% this fortnight.

Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Coalition voters and people intending to vote for someone other than the major parties are the strongest supporters of offshore detention, while Labor and Greens voters are more likely to oppose the policy. The Senate inquiry has heard appeals from doctors, refugee advocates and lawyers to maintain the medevac regime. The inquiry has heard from doctors responsible for health assessments that of 581 people in detention they have audited 97% have significant physical health issues and 91% have serious mental health issues. The latest Guardian Essential poll indicates Scott Morrison continues to enjoy support from voters post-election, with just under half the sample (49%) giving him the thumbs up. The approval has remained consistent post-election and Morrison\u2019s approval is five points higher that it was prior to the campaign. Voters are also still coming to terms with Labor\u2019s new leader, Anthony Albanese. Albanese gets the thumbs up from 36% of the sample, but 33% of respondents say they don\u2019t yet know whether they approve or disapprove. The disapproval rating for both leaders is similar \u2013 for Morrison its 36% and Albanese 31%. Morrison also remains ahead of his political opponent as better prime minister in the survey, with 46% backing the Liberal leader and 25% Albanese \u2013 which is a three-point drop for the Labor leader since last month. Voters were also asked questions this fortnight about the climate strike, scheduled for this Friday, and more than half the sample, 55% supported using strike action to push for governments to act on climate change and move towards renewable energy. Approval divides along partisan lines. Labor (74%) and Green voters (91%) approve of the action, as do voters under 34 (74%), university-educated voters (67%) and employed people (69%), while 41% of Coalition voters don\u2019t support the action. But only 5% of the sample will be striking on Friday with another 11% supporting the action in some other way. There has been controversy post-election about the reliability of opinion polling because none of the major surveys \u2013 Newspoll, Ipsos, Galaxy or Essential \u2013 correctly predicted a Coalition victory on 18 May, projecting Labor in front on a two-party-preferred vote of 51-49 and 52-48. The lack of precision in the polling has prompted public reflection at Essential, as has been flagged by its executive director, Peter Lewis. Guardian Australia is not now publishing measurements of primary votes or a two-party-preferred calculation, but is continuing to publish survey results of responses to questions about the leaders and a range of policy issues. The poll\u2019s margin of error is plus or minus 3%.",

Polls show the Lib Dems <a href=\"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/uk-general-election-polls-telling-223310473.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAEuqkeGkZoP-9gl7DsfKMIDGns8tKlTw-Co5uKMk4JKYpueKrWNc_B_ftz9kJJVgWS15qKchiUVMU0uXiwTZuiai7BDiBT43H9bdBU0PYerseIPJU24MMxFv17W92Kdvshj0alsSBocKC3mIrdtR6buVQwIzy4oNM3CfT_e6nwcn\" title=\"\">nipping</a> at Labour\u2019s heels. A victory in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/02/brecon-radnorshire-byelection-lib-dems-jane-dodds-win-cuts-johnson-commons-majority-to-one\" title=\"\">Brecon and Radnorshire</a> byelection and then the defection of half a dozen MPs from rivals in recent weeks has helped to attract a record membership. The party is now hoping to be swollen by an influx of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/13/brexit-remain-radicalisation-fbpe-peoples-vote\" title=\"\">radicalised remainers</a>, attracted by the party\u2019s decision to change its approach to Brexit. Lib Dems no longer want a second Brexit referendum; instead they would simply revoke article 50 without a public vote. This policy will only become law if the Lib Dems win a parliamentary majority, a possibility which the betting markets think has as little as a 5% <a href=\"https://www.oddschecker.com/politics/british-politics/next-uk-general-election/most-seats\" title=\"\">chance</a>. The party appears not to be serious about power, offering an empty pledge that is impossible to redeem.</p> <p>Ms Swinson\u2019s wager appears to be that she is right and the punters are wrong. In the Brexit referendum there was a tendency to underestimate the appeal of leave, and the Lib Dems think Westminster is now ignoring the latent remain vote. It is true that a petition supporting the revocation of article 50, which would stop Brexit in its tracks, <a href=\"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/241584\" title=\"\">attracted</a> more than 6m signatures. It is also the case that Brexit is likely to feature as a big issue in the next general election, and the Lib Dems see an advantage in carving a niche out of make-it-stop politics.</p> <p>The most obvious problem with this approach is that recent history <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/sep/11/second-brexit-referendum-ireland-lisbon-polls\" title=\"\">suggests</a> it takes a referendum to overturn a referendum. Ireland was the only country to submit the European Union\u2019s Lisbon treaty to a plebiscite. In 2008 Irish <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jun/13/ireland\" title=\"\">politicians</a> failed to convince the voters, who voted no by a margin of 53% to 46%. Sound familiar? The more educated voted yes and the least educated voted no. Among manual workers, three-quarters voted no. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/oct/03/ireland-votes-yes-lisbon-treaty\" title=\"\">A year later</a>, Irish voters thought better of the result, with two-thirds voting in favour of the Lisbon treaty.</p> <p>The winner-takes-all mentality behind Ms Swinson\u2019s policy is troubling. The lack of a democratic mandate for revoke means it could entrench a permanent divide in British life that will be impossible to bridge. Politicians ought to think about their policy\u2019s consequences. If the Lib Dems\u2019 idea is accepted, then why couldn\u2019t the SNP be <a href=\"https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/17905487.jo-swinson-accused-39-utterly-grotesque-39-hypocrisy-brexit-independence-referendums/\" title=\"\">permitted</a> to hold a second independence vote if it won the next Holyrood election? Then there are the accusations of inconsistency. In 2008 Ms Swinson <a href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080226/debtext/80226-0013.htm\" title=\"\">wanted</a> a referendum on EU membership. Two years later she campaigned on a manifesto that committed the Lib Dems to an in/out EU referendum. She was a minister in an austerity government that did so much to create the pain and division behind the leave howl. In 2016 an EU referendum took place. The country voted out. Three years later, Ms Swinson won\u2019t accept the outcome of a plebiscite she had said she wanted.</p> <p>The Lib Dems are positioning themselves to tap future popular revulsion against the major parties. Yet the politics of protest only works if there is something to protest about. If Boris Johnson strikes a Brexit deal with the EU, where does this leave Ms Swinson?

      "bodyText": "Do gamblers know something that pollsters do not? Ever since the Liberal Democrats\u2019 record European election result and the arrival of their new leader, Jo Swinson, there\u2019s been a spring in their step. Polls show the Lib Dems nipping at Labour\u2019s heels. A victory in the Brecon and Radnorshire byelection and then the defection of half a dozen MPs from rivals in recent weeks has helped to attract a record membership. The party is now hoping to be swollen by an influx of radicalised remainers, attracted by the party\u2019s decision to change its approach to Brexit. Lib Dems no longer want a second Brexit referendum; instead they would simply revoke article 50 without a public vote. This policy will only become law if the Lib Dems win a parliamentary majority, a possibility which the betting markets think has as little as a 5% chance. The party appears not to be serious about power, offering an empty pledge that is impossible to redeem. Ms Swinson\u2019s wager appears to be that she is right and the punters are wrong. In the Brexit referendum there was a tendency to underestimate the appeal of leave, and the Lib Dems think Westminster is now ignoring the latent remain vote. It is true that a petition supporting the revocation of article 50, which would stop Brexit in its tracks, attracted more than 6m signatures. It is also the case that Brexit is likely to feature as a big issue in the next general election, and the Lib Dems see an advantage in carving a niche out of make-it-stop politics. The most obvious problem with this approach is that recent history suggests it takes a referendum to overturn a referendum. Ireland was the only country to submit the European Union\u2019s Lisbon treaty to a plebiscite. In 2008 Irish politicians failed to convince the voters, who voted no by a margin of 53% to 46%. Sound familiar? The more educated voted yes and the least educated voted no. Among manual workers, three-quarters voted no. A year later, Irish voters thought better of the result, with two-thirds voting in favour of the Lisbon treaty. The winner-takes-all mentality behind Ms Swinson\u2019s policy is troubling. The lack of a democratic mandate for revoke means it could entrench a permanent divide in British life that will be impossible to bridge. Politicians ought to think about their policy\u2019s consequences. If the Lib Dems\u2019 idea is accepted, then why couldn\u2019t the SNP be permitted to hold a second independence vote if it won the next Holyrood election? Then there are the accusations of inconsistency. In 2008 Ms Swinson wanted a referendum on EU membership. Two years later she campaigned on a manifesto that committed the Lib Dems to an in/out EU referendum. She was a minister in an austerity government that did so much to create the pain and division behind the leave howl. In 2016 an EU referendum took place. The country voted out. Three years later, Ms Swinson won\u2019t accept the outcome of a plebiscite she had said she wanted. The Lib Dems are positioning themselves to tap future popular revulsion against the major parties. Yet the politics of protest only works if there is something to protest about. If Boris Johnson strikes a Brexit deal with the EU, where does this leave Ms Swinson? The Lib Dem policy also gives Labour a clear run at a second referendum. Ms Swinson\u2019s offer is just to permanently polarise the electorate around Brexit. The Lib Dems still have no distinctive pitch for issues beyond leaving the EU. This is the party of ideas, home to Keynes and Beveridge. But there\u2019s no sign of a middle way being plotted by the party between the extremes. Unless Ms Swinson can do so, the odds will be stacked against the Lib Dems in a general election.",

      "bodyText": "One of the new Liberal Democrat MP recruits, Dr Phillip Lee, who has been dogged by criticism from activists over his record on LGBT rights since he joined the party, claims his views have been misrepresented. LGBT activists in senior party roles quit in protest after the former Tory justice minister was accepted into the Lib Dems earlier this month. His dramatic defection eliminated prime minister Boris Johnson\u2019s majority. Lee, who is a GP, was criticised heavily for tabling an amendment to the 2014 Immigration Bill calling for immigrants to be tested for HIV before they are granted permission to come to the UK. He also abstained on the same-sex marriage vote. Lib Dem members\u2019 views on Lee have been noticeable throughout the party\u2019s annual autumn conference in Bournemouth, with the leader, Jo Swinson, heckled for defending his admission into the party. But he told the Guardian\u2019s Today in Focus podcast: \u201cThere\u2019s been coverage of misrepresentation of my views. \u201cMy view was that it\u2019s better that with people coming into this country we knew their status so that they could be treated, and also that we could prevent further infection spreading. That\u2019s not how it\u2019s been portrayed in certain quarters.\u201d He said his comment was made on his medical experience of working with sub-Saharan African patients coming to see their GP with what he described as an \u201cAids-defining illness\u201d. \u201cI have to draw upon my medical experience \u2013 when you\u2019ve been confronted with the reality of a sub-Saharan African patient presenting with an Aids-defining illness in general practice, this person not knowing that they were HIV positive in advance, and therefore they\u2019ve been leading a life like anyone else, without any knowledge, and then they\u2019re actually developing illness because of their ignorance of their status, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right, morally, for those people not to know. That would be the purpose.\u201d He said his amendment was intended to provoke debate and had not gone to a vote. \u201cBecause it\u2019s a sensitive and difficult issue, and there\u2019s quite understandable sensitivities around the wrong stigmatisation of HIV in the past,\u201d he said. Jennie Rigg, the party\u2019s LGBT chair said his views were so diametrically opposed to hers that she no longer felt at home in the Lib Dems and resigned from her job. Uneasiness around his appointment has also been noted by fellow MPs, who are working hard to revitalise the image of the party as progressive on gay rights and trans issues. Former leader Tim Farron sparked outrage when he took several weeks during the 2017 general election campaign to give a clear answer on whether he thought gay sex was a sin. The staunch Christian said he later regretted how he handled questions around his faith. Lee told the Today in Focus podcast he is currently \u201chaving conversations\u201d with LGBT groups in Lib Dems. Layla Moran MP, who is leading on the party\u2019s equalities agenda, was instrumental in passing a new policy at conference on Saturday that would end trans peoples\u2019 partners having a \u2018veto\u2019 over whether they can be legally recognised as their preferred gender. In an interview with the Guardian, she said the deep drive on equalities topics was not linked directly to Farron\u2019s time as leader, but admitted he \u201cwasn\u2019t always as enthusiastic as the rest of the party\u201d in that area. On the notion gay people have not felt welcome in the party in recent years, she it was something she \u201cabsolutely\u201d regrets. She said Lee is not homophobic but \u201che made a scientific and clinical view when he was a Tory MP\u201d. She said: \u201cI would love to think that if he was a Lib Dem at the time we would have told him what\u2019s what, and the bigger picture. \u201cI\u2019m really sad those campaigners, some of those who wrote the [spousal veto] amendment, feel that they can\u2019t join in conference this year.\u201d The party\u2019s new MPs, who come from both the Tories and Labour, have packed out fringe meetings at this year\u2019s conference. Luciana Berger, who quit Labour, said she expected a handful of members to come and see her at a question and answer session, but instead was met by close to 100 activists who cheered her as she discussed her decision to defect to the party. Lee told how his own defection \u2013 dramatically in front of Johnson in the Commons chamber \u2013 had seen his heart rate soar. He said: \u201cI sat down next to Jo Swinson and about four minutes after I sat down my watch started to vibrate. \u201cIt was flashing at me, and I\u2019d never seen it do that before. I looked at it and it was telling me my pulse rate was running at more than 120 and I wasn\u2019t moving. \u201cAs a doctor I thought, OK, no wonder it\u2019s now worried something is happening and that I need to seek medical attention.\u201d",

An open border in Ireland would be bought at the expense of hard-as-rock borders all around the rest of the UK. Scotland would rightly demand the same as Northern Ireland, or leave. The risk is that sheer exhaustion will make any rotten deal that the Hulk drags home look better than nothing. That\u2019s when the unity of all remainers must hold fast: no party advantage-scoring, no absurd refusal to work with Corbyn, all ready to resist together any bad deal in that famous last ditch. \u2022 Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist",

The government has bowed to pressure to extend the deadline after a damning report from the National Audit Office said households might be forced to pay \u00a3500m more than expected after a string of delays affecting the software underpinning the network. Gillian Guy, the chief executive of Citizens Advice, said the deadline extension was \u201ca commonsense move that is good news for consumers\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s been clear for a long time that the 2020 deadline wouldn\u2019t be met and today\u2019s announcement finally recognises that reality,\u201d she said.

      "bodyText": "The BBC is to switch off its Red Button teletext service from the start of next year, the broadcaster has confirmed. Ceefax, the BBC\u2019s analogue teletext service, finished in October 2012 with the switchover to digital. It was replaced by BBC Red Button, which allowed viewers to read news and sports content on their TVs. A spokesperson said the service would be stopped in early 2020 as the broadcaster needed to channel resources into \u201ceven better internet-based services\u201d. The closure of the service marks the end of the BBC\u2019s teletext, 45 years after it began as Ceefax \u2013 a phonetic take on \u201csee facts\u201d \u2013 in 1974. Credited as being the world\u2019s first teletext service, Ceefax transmitted via unused bits of the broadcast spectrum and provided up-to-date news, sport and weather, along with reviews, quizzes, a children\u2019s section and the latest TV and radio listings. A BBC spokesperson said: \u201cFrom early 2020, viewers will no longer be able to access text-based BBC News and BBC Sport content by pressing red. \u201cIt\u2019s always a difficult decision to reduce services, and we don\u2019t take decisions like this lightly, but we have taken it because we have to balance the resources needed to maintain and develop this service with the need to update our systems to give people even better internet-based services. \u201cViewers can still access this information on the BBC website, BBC News and Sport mobile apps \u2013 as well as 24-hour news on the BBC News channel.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The climate crisis was on the agenda again at London fashion week on Monday, with sustainability experts and activists taking part in a symposium at the Finnish Institute focusing on creativity and sustainability. It was in keeping with fashion week so far, which has seen Extinction Rebellion activists<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/sep/13/do-or-die-extinction-rebellions-die-in-london-to-end-with-fashion-funeral\"> stage a \u201cdie-in\u201d</a> and swarm the Victoria Beckham show, one of the week\u2019s highest-profile events, hoping to force the industry to take the climate emergency seriously.</p> <p>The symposium was a follow-up to July\u2019s Helsinki fashion week, which is open exclusively to designers and brands who produce sustainable collections. Similar events have already taken place in New York, and there are more planned for Paris and Milan \u2013 part of a programme focusing on sustainability and the identity of each host city. For London\u2019s instalment, which was chaired by Helsinki fashion week\u2019s founder, Evelyn Mora, creativity was deemed an appropriate topic given the British capital is, in her words, \u201cthe belly of the beast\u201d, known for its fashion-forward approach to design.</p> <p>The audience was a mix of activists and fashion insiders wearing Matrix glasses and cowboy boots. Hung around the space \u2013 and worn by model-activists Nimue Smit and Aine Campbell, who were in attendance \u2013 were garments from some of the designers who showed at Helsinki, including the young Liverpudlian Patrick McDowell (whose work using unwanted fabrics has garnered him <a href=\"https://www.dazeddigital.com/fashion/article/41066/1/mia-central-saint-martins-graduate-sustainable-design-patrick-mcdowell\">big-name fans such as MIA</a>), Ka Wa Key, young n sang and Bleu Chose.</p> <p>Mora, who founded Helsinki fashion week in 2014, said designers often asked her whether creativity is an obstacle to sustainability. For her, they are not mutually exclusive: \u201cInnovation to me is no longer about travelling to the moon; it is about finding something new in the old.\u201d </p> <p>The panel also included Sara Arnold, a founding member of Extinction Rebellion; Charlotte Turner, the head of sustainable fashion and textiles at Eco-Age, a London-based sustainability consultancy; Dr Amy Twigger Holroyd, a professor of the school of art and design at Nottingham Trent University and Bel Jacobs, a former Metro fashion editor and Extinction Rebellion member. Each were invited to give their take on what creativity means.</p> <p>All agreed the focus need not be simply on creating new products, but also on finding solutions. Holroyd, who is a board member of the Council of Concerned Researchers in Fashion, said: \u201cmaybe answers already exist in different contexts and cultures.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c1a238bbd177a8a254f4a7bc4c2a7127194d9742\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c1a238bbd177a8a254f4a7bc4c2a7127194d9742/0_0_5815_3489/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Symposium at the Finnish Institute focussing on sustainability\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Symposium at the Finnish Institute focussing on sustainability</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Publicity Image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Jacobs spoke of creativity stemming from limitation, saying she had seen innovative design starting with what material was available \u2013 \u201cI only have these things; what can I make with them?\u201d \u2013 rather than with the end garment already in mind. She added that it was about rethinking what it is to be creative.</p> <p>Extinction Rebellion puts an emphasis on creativity via reusing what is already out there. Arnold said it was about \u201cgoing into secondhand and vintage shops and finding something that means something to you and chimes with your personality,\u201d as well as looking into your own wardrobe. As she pointed out: \u201cwe probably already have enough clothes in there to last us the next 20 years.\u201d Jacobs pointed to Sara\u2019s fashion-forward vintage glasses, often the subject of comments, for proof that \u201cwe\u2019re not saying [we need to see] the end of creativity\u201d. What did need to change, she said, was \u201cthe system of production, consumption, disposal.\u201d</p> <p>Creativity will also be necessary in rethinking the fashion industry as a whole \u2013 according to Arnold, \u201cwe need to start envisioning another world.\u201d Holroyd spoke of the need to acknowledge that the capitalist model was inherently unsustainable, while Mora said the industry was broken and needed to come together before it could move forward.</p> <p>Turner said getting companies to implement a living wage was key: \u201cThe whole fashion system is basically propped up by the fact they are currently able to employ people and not pay them a living wage.\u201d A living wage, she said, \u201cwill force brands to realise that if they want to keep producing at such high volumes they will need to rethink their whole supply chain.\u201d For Extinction Rebellion, solutions need to be drastic \u2013 in line with the 18 months some scientists say we have left <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/06/human-society-under-urgent-threat-loss-earth-natural-life-un-report\">to save the planet</a> \u2013 and cannot work within the current capitalist system.</p> <p>They are hoping their London fashion week interventions, which will culminate in a funeral march for the fashion industry on Tuesday, will help. For Jacobs, the British Fashion Council (BFC) standing up and saying we are in a climate emergency would be a powerful step. While the BFC has spoken of a commitment to sustainability goals, it is a far cry from Helsinki fashion week, which is known, even among the eco-conscious fashion weeks of Scandinavia, as a pioneer. At this year\u2019s instalment, <a href=\"https://www.dezeen.com/2019/07/30/sustainable-fashion-leather-helsinki-fashion-week-evelyn-mora/\">animal leather was banned</a>, with designers encouraged to use plant-based leathers and other sustainable textiles.</p> <p>While the picture is bleak \u2013 the <a href=\"https://uk.fashionnetwork.com/news/Global-apparel-footwear-consumption-may-rise-by-63-in-2030,830700.html#.XX-__G9KhHc\">63% projected increase</a> in global apparel consumption by 2030 sits uneasily next to news of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/07/oceans-demise-the-end-of-the-arctic-as-we-know-it\">melting ice caps</a> and species being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jul/23/animals-failing-to-adapt-to-speed-of-climate-crisis-study-finds\">driven to extinction</a> \u2013 there were also words of encouragement from the panel. Arnold put fashion at the heart of affecting change, rather than being simply an ill that needed remedying: \u201cThink how you can use the communicative power of fashion to get this message out there,\u201d she said, having earlier cited the practice of printing T-shirts people already own with slogans. \u201cAs a communication tool, fashion is so influential \u2013 we all have to put clothes on and that has power.\u201d</p> <p>Holroyd spoke of \u201ccreating visions of alternative worlds\u201d as a \u201ccreative, powerful, playful and highly subversive act\u201d. Earlier in the talk, she also cited Ursula K Le Guin: \u201cWe live in capitalism, its power seems inescapable \u2013 but then, so did the divine right of kings.\u201d </p>",

They are hoping their London fashion week interventions, which will culminate in a funeral march for the fashion industry on Tuesday, will help. For Jacobs, the British Fashion Council (BFC) standing up and saying we are in a climate emergency would be a powerful step. While the BFC has spoken of a commitment to sustainability goals, it is a far cry from Helsinki fashion week, which is known, even among the eco-conscious fashion weeks of Scandinavia, as a pioneer. At this year\u2019s instalment, animal leather was banned, with designers encouraged to use plant-based leathers and other sustainable textiles. While the picture is bleak \u2013 the 63% projected increase in global apparel consumption by 2030 sits uneasily next to news of melting ice caps and species being driven to extinction \u2013 there were also words of encouragement from the panel. Arnold put fashion at the heart of affecting change, rather than being simply an ill that needed remedying: \u201cThink how you can use the communicative power of fashion to get this message out there,\u201d she said, having earlier cited the practice of printing T-shirts people already own with slogans. \u201cAs a communication tool, fashion is so influential \u2013 we all have to put clothes on and that has power.\u201d Holroyd spoke of \u201ccreating visions of alternative worlds\u201d as a \u201ccreative, powerful, playful and highly subversive act\u201d. Earlier in the talk, she also cited Ursula K Le Guin: \u201cWe live in capitalism, its power seems inescapable \u2013 but then, so did the divine right of kings.\u201d",

The onus is on them to attack but it might be a risk for Lampard to throw caution to the wind when his most experienced centre-back, Antonio R\u00fcdiger, is out with a groin injury and N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 will be missing in midfield for the fourth consecutive game. Any team would be weaker without Kant\u00e9\u2019s drive and Lampard will not have forgotten how Jorginho and Mateo Kovacic struggled to protect Chelsea\u2019s back four in the 2-2 home draw with Sheffield United last month, which means that Kurt Zouma could start alongside Andreas Christensen and Fikayo Tomori. Not that Lampard views the Champions League as work experience for his youngsters. He is targeting qualification from a tight group and it is already clear why he has so much faith in Chelsea\u2019s talented academy graduates. Tomori has impressed, Mason Mount has been superb in midfield and Abraham has seven goals in his last three games after his hat-trick against Wolves. All that youthful brio could take Chelsea far. First, however, they have to listen to Lampard\u2019s advice and avoid falling into Valencia\u2019s trap.",

      "bodyText": "Thomas Cook has delayed a crunch creditors\u2019 vote until next week, giving the stricken tour operator more time to smooth obstacles to a \u00a31.1bn rescue package aimed at saving it from collapse. Fears for the future of the the 178-year-old tour operator have been mounting, as it threatens to buckle under the weight of high debt, intense competition and one-off factors including last summer\u2019s heatwave and Brexit uncertainty. The company, which employs 20,000 staff, including 9,000 in the UK, succeeded on Monday with a courtroom application to put off a creditors\u2019 vote over the terms of a \u00a3900m rescue funding injection \u2013 which could yet rise to \u00a31.1bn \u2013 until next week. Shares in the company slumped 10%, taking the decline in the last 12 months to 94% and leaving the entire business valued at just \u00a369m. But they recovered slightly on news of the delay. Earlier this year, the company agreed the terms of a debt-for-equity swap that would hand 75% of its holiday business to the Chinese conglomerate Fosun, which also owns Club Med. Banks and bondholders would take the remaining 25% of the tours arm and gain control of 75% of the airline, with Fosun owning the rest. Shareholders are being wiped out in the deal. The injection of \u00a3900m, split 50/50 between Fosun and the lenders, would tide Thomas Cook through the traditionally barren winter period when cashflow dries up due to the lower volume of holiday bookings. But the finer details of the rescue package \u2013 and crucially the likelihood of its success \u2013 depend on bondholders, including two hedge funds, the Mayfair-based Sona and the German investor Xaia. Sources familiar with the discussions said bondholders had bought credit default swaps (CDS) on their loans, which act as a kind of insurance that only pays out if the bonds become worthless. The bondholders need that to happen for their CDS payouts to be triggered and are pressing for the deal to be structured in a way that ensures they do not lose out. If they cannot get the deal restructured they could derail it, putting the future of the company at risk. In court filings seen by Sky News last week Thomas Cook warned that it was running out of cash and needed to finalise the deal quickly. \u201cThe serious liquidity issues within the group have led to an urgent need to complete any restructuring within September,\u201d it said. Thomas Cook will now have a further week to iron out the details, ahead of key votes on 27 and 30 September. The rescue deal requires support from lenders holding 75% of the company\u2019s debt. \u201cThe company continues to target implementation of the recapitalisation in early October,\u201d it said in a statement. The global travel group also needs to persuade the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) \u2013 which administers the Air Travel Organiser\u2019s Licence (Atol) scheme covering travel companies \u2013 that it should renew its licence at the end of September for another 12 months. Sources played down suggestions over the weekend that the CAA was drawing up contingency plans to deal with the possibility of having to repatriate tens of thousands of passengers if they are stranded abroad. Some 11 million customers will have travelled with Thomas Cook by the end of the commercially important summer season. It is estimated that there are tens of thousands of Britons currently overseas on holidays they have purchased from the company.

The broadcaster and naturalist will act as an ambassador to promote the review around the world as the government attempts to demonstrate its determination to fight the climate emergency. Led by the Cambridge university professor Sir Partha Dasgupta, the review will look into the benefits of biodiversity globally and assess the financial costs and risks the loss of natural habitats, environments and wildlife would have for the economy. The study will then put forward recommendations to promote both biodiversity and economic prosperity. The study, commissioned by the Treasury under the former chancellor Philip Hammond, is an attempt by the government to show that Britain is at the forefront of protecting the environment. It also comes after Theresa May committed the government to net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Climate campaigners have criticised the government for failing to take enough action to tackle the scale of the crisis posed by global heating. The chancellor, Sajid Javid, unveiled his spending priorities for the year ahead at a review this month, with Greenpeace UK warning the government had fallen \u201cwoefully short\u201d of providing anywhere near enough funding to meet its net-zero target. Javid said: \u201cProtecting nature\u2019s biodiversity has both environmental and economic benefits.

Given these origins, the novel occupies a unique space at the intersection between truth and fiction, history and myth.\u201d</p> <p>Don\u2019t let that put you off, either.</p> <p>Its narrative is fractured and contains several disparate, frequently contradictory strands.</p> <p>One purports to be the titular biography of Ezra Maas. He is supposed to be a polymath genius, an artist and writer who turned down both the Nobel prize for literature and the Turner prize. We are told he was born on 1 January 1950, but also that he may never have existed. We are also told he was prolific and famous but that his artworks have been removed from galleries, his books are not available and nearly all traces of him have been removed from the internet.</p> <p>A second strand contains interview extracts from people who may or may not have known Maas, can never quite remember what he looks like and who generally undermine each other.</p> <p>A third strand contains the autobiographical notes of Daniel James who has himself been commissioned to write about Maas, following a dead-of-night phone call. He spends a lot of time acting out the role of a noirish detective, getting beaten up by shadowy strangers, drinking bourbon, and questioning his own reality as well as the existence of Maas. He often says things like:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s all subterfuge - quantum mechanics, the unspeakable name of God, breaking through to a new psychological state of being, returning to a pre-linguistic state, restoring humanity to a core self, revealing the ultimate truth or discovering there is no truth at all - maybe it\u2019s all smoke and mirrors?</p> </blockquote> <p>Fourthly, there are also more than 500 footnotes, provided by another self-styled \u201canonymous\u201d author who claims to have gathered together these various elements into one book. Sometimes these provide elucidation on the various \u201cfacts\u201d provided in the novel. Sometimes they are deliberately misleading. Sometimes they stretch over several pages with long disquisitions on Borges, textual games and their own slippery nature.</p> <p>But still. I don\u2019t think you should let any of that put you off. Not even when I re-emphasise that The Unauthorised Biography of Ezra Maas is preposterous. It\u2019s agonisingly meta. It spends an awful lot of time banging on about quantum theory and fiction versus reality and how do we know what reality is anyway? It can often feel like a lecture from your stoner undergraduate friend who is still trying to work out if a sound is made if a tree falls down in a forest when no one is there to hear it.</p> <p>While I\u2019m picking holes I might also say that the idea that this epoch-shaking artist might have been able to erase all traces of his work is singularly hard to believe. What\u2019s more, these creations are never convincingly described. One \u201cmind-bending\u201d artwork is supposedly the conversion of a town house into a \u201cliving museum\u201d full of artists doing various bits of performance art and various sculptures made of \u201ccardboard and newspaper, plaster and melted lead.\u201d Not impressive.</p> <p>Elsewhere, the artistic discussions are all too predictable. Pause before reading the following list to see if you can guess the (blokey) names the novel name-checks. Ready? Andy Warhol, Bob Dylan, David Lynch, Jackson Pollock, David Bowie, Hunter S Thompson, Banksy, Charles Manson, Charles Bukowski, William Burroughs, David Lynch again and often, Allen Ginsberg and so on. Paul Auster is probably the most surprising cameo. And that isn\u2019t saying much in a metafictional novel all about the act of writing and which is frequently set in New York.</p> <p>Even so. I didn\u2019t mind. Because this book is also fun. It\u2019s playful and witty. You could even take the obviousness of that roll-call as one of its games. Perhaps it\u2019s a way of anchoring an improbable story within a world that seems safely predictable. Maybe it\u2019s a knowing wink at the readers. Or possibly it\u2019s a joke at the expense of all the other breathless accounts of artistic ferment in the world. The book leaves all possibilities open. It forever asks questions and rarely makes the mistake of answering them. It just leaves us guessing. Come to think of it, is that art installation I complained about even supposed to sound epoch-making? Who knows?</p> <p>Plenty of my other concerns are also addressed by the novel\u2019s clever use of false leads (I especially enjoyed the idea that Maas might have attended <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locations_in_His_Dark_Materials#Jordan_College%20in%20Oxford\">Jordan College</a>) and knowing jokes. \u201cIsn\u2019t it a bit of a clich\u00e9? The bourbon-drinking writer?\u201d a character asks Daniel James. And, of course, it is. All genre expectations are dutifully met and cheekily subverted. But that doesn\u2019t stop this story strand from being curiously engaging, even as it becomes increasingly daft. I found myself feeling sorry for poor old Daniel James, in spite of my residual resentment about being led into a never-ending hall of mirrors. In the final reckoning, I\u2019m not sure that the book amounts to much. But nor am I certain that there isn\u2019t more to it. Maybe if I read it again, I\u2019ll see it entirely differently. It\u2019s that kind of book. Which is to say, it\u2019s singular.</p> <p><strong>Our next book is:</strong> Spring by Ali Smith. I\u2019ll be posting my review next Monday, 23 September.</p>",

A second strand contains interview extracts from people who may or may not have known Maas, can never quite remember what he looks like and who generally undermine each other. A third strand contains the autobiographical notes of Daniel James who has himself been commissioned to write about Maas, following a dead-of-night phone call. He spends a lot of time acting out the role of a noirish detective, getting beaten up by shadowy strangers, drinking bourbon, and questioning his own reality as well as the existence of Maas. He often says things like: \u201cMaybe it\u2019s all subterfuge - quantum mechanics, the unspeakable name of God, breaking through to a new psychological state of being, returning to a pre-linguistic state, restoring humanity to a core self, revealing the ultimate truth or discovering there is no truth at all - maybe it\u2019s all smoke and mirrors? Fourthly, there are also more than 500 footnotes, provided by another self-styled \u201canonymous\u201d author who claims to have gathered together these various elements into one book. Sometimes these provide elucidation on the various \u201cfacts\u201d provided in the novel. Sometimes they are deliberately misleading. Sometimes they stretch over several pages with long disquisitions on Borges, textual games and their own slippery nature. But still. I don\u2019t think you should let any of that put you off. Not even when I re-emphasise that The Unauthorised Biography of Ezra Maas is preposterous. It\u2019s agonisingly meta. It spends an awful lot of time banging on about quantum theory and fiction versus reality and how do we know what reality is anyway? It can often feel like a lecture from your stoner undergraduate friend who is still trying to work out if a sound is made if a tree falls down in a forest when no one is there to hear it. While I\u2019m picking holes I might also say that the idea that this epoch-shaking artist might have been able to erase all traces of his work is singularly hard to believe. What\u2019s more, these creations are never convincingly described. One \u201cmind-bending\u201d artwork is supposedly the conversion of a town house into a \u201cliving museum\u201d full of artists doing various bits of performance art and various sculptures made of \u201ccardboard and newspaper, plaster and melted lead.\u201d Not impressive. Elsewhere, the artistic discussions are all too predictable. Pause before reading the following list to see if you can guess the (blokey) names the novel name-checks. Ready? Andy Warhol, Bob Dylan, David Lynch, Jackson Pollock, David Bowie, Hunter S Thompson, Banksy, Charles Manson, Charles Bukowski, William Burroughs, David Lynch again and often, Allen Ginsberg and so on. Paul Auster is probably the most surprising cameo. And that isn\u2019t saying much in a metafictional novel all about the act of writing and which is frequently set in New York. Even so. I didn\u2019t mind. Because this book is also fun. It\u2019s playful and witty. You could even take the obviousness of that roll-call as one of its games. Perhaps it\u2019s a way of anchoring an improbable story within a world that seems safely predictable. Maybe it\u2019s a knowing wink at the readers. Or possibly it\u2019s a joke at the expense of all the other breathless accounts of artistic ferment in the world. The book leaves all possibilities open. It forever asks questions and rarely makes the mistake of answering them. It just leaves us guessing. Come to think of it, is that art installation I complained about even supposed to sound epoch-making? Who knows? Plenty of my other concerns are also addressed by the novel\u2019s clever use of false leads (I especially enjoyed the idea that Maas might have attended Jordan College) and knowing jokes. \u201cIsn\u2019t it a bit of a clich\u00e9? The bourbon-drinking writer?\u201d a character asks Daniel James. And, of course, it is. All genre expectations are dutifully met and cheekily subverted. But that doesn\u2019t stop this story strand from being curiously engaging, even as it becomes increasingly daft. I found myself feeling sorry for poor old Daniel James, in spite of my residual resentment about being led into a never-ending hall of mirrors. In the final reckoning, I\u2019m not sure that the book amounts to much. But nor am I certain that there isn\u2019t more to it. Maybe if I read it again, I\u2019ll see it entirely differently. It\u2019s that kind of book. Which is to say, it\u2019s singular. Our next book is: Spring by Ali Smith. I\u2019ll be posting my review next Monday, 23 September.",

      "bodyText": "The actor Christopher Eccleston has spoken for the first time about his poor mental health, revealing that he has lived with eating disorders and had considered suicide. The Doctor Who actor was praised by charities for his bravery, after writing in his forthcoming autobiography that he was \u201ca lifelong body hater\u201d. \u201cMany times I\u2019ve wanted to reveal that I\u2019m a lifelong anorexic and dysmorphic,\u201d he wrote in I Love the Bones of You. \u201cI never have. I always thought of it as a filthy secret, because I\u2019m northern, because I\u2019m male and because I\u2019m working class.\u201d The 55-year-old said he had been ill with the eating disorder during the filming of Doctor Who. \u201cThe illness is still there raging within me as the Doctor,\u201d he wrote. \u201cPeople love the way I look in that series, but I was very ill. The reward for that illness was the part. And therein lies the perpetuation of the whole sorry situation.\u201d Eccleston wrote that he was diagnosed with clinical depression after separating from his wife in 2015, a period during which he considered killing himself. \u201cI was in a state of extreme anxiety, convinced I was either going to die or I was going to kill myself. In my despair I reached for my phone and looked up a psychiatric hospital, I rang ahead, grabbed my bag and ran.\u201d He said that being prescribed antidepressants had helped his recovery. \u201cI am on them to this day. I could be on them for the rest of my days. I do have an issue with that,\u201d wrote Eccleston. \u201cI would like to attempt slowly to reduce the dose, to experience reality again, to see how I do \u2026 And yet, interestingly, I have received some of the best reviews of my life since I started taking them.\u201d A spokesperson for the eating disorder charity Beat said it took courage to speak about having anorexia. \u201cDoing so helps to combat the stigma and misunderstanding that exists around these serious mental illnesses, especially for men and boys,\u201d they said. \u201cWe hope that Christopher has received the support he needed and that his bravery will encourage others to seek help, as we know that the sooner someone gets help for an eating disorder, the better their chances of recovery.\u201d \u2022 For help and advice on eating disorders in the UK, contact Beat on 0808 801 0677; in the US, contact the NEDA on (800) 931-2237; and in Australia, contact the Butterfly Foundation on 1800 33 4673. In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14. Other international helplines can be found at www.befrienders.org.",

Speaking on behalf of France and Germany, De Montchalin described the general picture in the parliament\u2019s report as worrying and said it was Hungary\u2019s responsibility to demonstrate that the issues raised had been closed. Earlier that day, the Hungarian government\u2019s chief spokesman, Zolt\u00e1n Kov\u00e1cs, claimed the parliament\u2019s report \u201cregurgitates a laundry list of all the criticisms that Europe\u2019s liberals have thrown at the Orb\u00e1n government since 2010\u201d, the year Orb\u00e1n became prime minister for a second term. \u201cIt\u2019s the same left-liberal forces that now want to take revenge on Hungary for standing up against the influx of immigrants and insisting that Europe\u2019s Schengen border be secured,\u201d he added. Under EU law, the process could lead to Hungary being stripped of its voting rights, but that outcome is almost unthinkable, because of a pact with Poland. Any move to strip Hungary of voting rights could be blocked by its ally, which is subject to the same procedure and counts on Budapest\u2019s protection. Both countries stand a greater risk of losing EU funds, as more member states balk at funding governments accused of corruption and seen as bending the EU\u2019s basic democratic values. In a paper presented to ministers on Monday, Germany \u2013 the largest contributor to the EU budget \u2013 reaffirmed there should be a link between EU funds and rule of law. EU diplomats say the current rule of law process against Hungary is valuable despite the uncertain result. \u201cThis is of course, not a witch-hunt, this is not against anyone.

      "body": "<h2><strong>THE CARROWING</strong></h2> <p>Following a maiden season in England in which his expensively assembled Manchester City team won nothing, Pep Guardiola was labelled a charlatan by fans of opposition teams who saw this failure as proof his fancy-dan foreign ways would never catch on in the Premier League. The same fans have since been forced to eat their words on numerous occasions, never more so than on Saturday when a Norwich City side sticking fairly rigidly to the Guardiola blueprint, showed that intensive pressing high up the pitch coupled with a confident tiki-taka style of possession football can be extremely effective indeed, hoisting Pep and his men by their own petard and causing a seismic shock across the Premier League landscape. Not bad for a plucky team of church mice assembled for a total cost of \u00a36.45m, a mere \u00a3399.65m less than the side they vanquished <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/14/norwich-city-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report\">by the odd goal in five</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/sep/16/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekend-action\">Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend\u2019s action</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With their team already dropping one point per game against their only realistic title rivals Liverpool, Manchester City are firmly on course to finish as runners-up, a mere 38 points off the pace. And considering some Manchester City fans have never seemed more upset and unhappy than when they were invading press boxes or mouth-foaming on Social Media Disgrace Twitter in the immediate aftermath of the most successful season in their history, it can only be a matter of time until the more impatient among them are calling for their manager\u2019s shiny head. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/5liveSport/status/1172946863567208448\">Oh</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThey gave me all the prestige I have in England, [in] the first season when it was Fraud Guardiola, Fraudiola,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/15/pep-guardiola-manchester-city-norwich\">parped Pep</a>, stepping into the hail of bullets fired his team\u2019s way upon being asked if he\u2019d be throwing Sheikh Mansour\u2019s best china around the dressing room after his players were beaten by a tremendously disciplined effort by Daniel Farke\u2019s fearless outfit. \u201cThis kind of game here in England, [they said] it\u2019s not possible to play because you need to have tackles and you have to play like that. These players gave me the prestige that I have. And now all around the world people say how good a manager I am \u2013 it\u2019s for them, not for me.\u201d Kind words, softly spoken.

As a former inner-city five-a-side keeper, I have never played a competitive match on grass. For 18 bruising seasons our league games were played on solid concrete, covered by a ridiculously thin membrane that can only be described as Action Man hair. The mild inconvenience of a manhole, an oak tree, standing water or various dangerous but ultimately avoidable detritus cannot compare to continuously slamming your hips, knees and elbows on concrete every 30 seconds for 40 minutes each Thursday night. It is hell. On the plus side, qualifying for the regional cup competition meant playing on luscious 3G pitches.

      "bodyText": "THE CARROWING Following a maiden season in England in which his expensively assembled Manchester City team won nothing, Pep Guardiola was labelled a charlatan by fans of opposition teams who saw this failure as proof his fancy-dan foreign ways would never catch on in the Premier League. The same fans have since been forced to eat their words on numerous occasions, never more so than on Saturday when a Norwich City side sticking fairly rigidly to the Guardiola blueprint, showed that intensive pressing high up the pitch coupled with a confident tiki-taka style of possession football can be extremely effective indeed, hoisting Pep and his men by their own petard and causing a seismic shock across the Premier League landscape. Not bad for a plucky team of church mice assembled for a total cost of \u00a36.45m, a mere \u00a3399.65m less than the side they vanquished by the odd goal in five. With their team already dropping one point per game against their only realistic title rivals Liverpool, Manchester City are firmly on course to finish as runners-up, a mere 38 points off the pace. And considering some Manchester City fans have never seemed more upset and unhappy than when they were invading press boxes or mouth-foaming on Social Media Disgrace Twitter in the immediate aftermath of the most successful season in their history, it can only be a matter of time until the more impatient among them are calling for their manager\u2019s shiny head. Oh. \u201cThey gave me all the prestige I have in England, [in] the first season when it was Fraud Guardiola, Fraudiola,\u201d parped Pep, stepping into the hail of bullets fired his team\u2019s way upon being asked if he\u2019d be throwing Sheikh Mansour\u2019s best china around the dressing room after his players were beaten by a tremendously disciplined effort by Daniel Farke\u2019s fearless outfit. \u201cThis kind of game here in England, [they said] it\u2019s not possible to play because you need to have tackles and you have to play like that. These players gave me the prestige that I have. And now all around the world people say how good a manager I am \u2013 it\u2019s for them, not for me.\u201d Kind words, softly spoken. The Fiver can\u2019t help but wonder if he was as magnanimous on the other side of the closed dressing-room door. LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE Join Niall McVeigh from 7.30pm for hot MBM coverage of Manchester United 1-2 Arsenal in the WSL, along with Aston Villa 2-1 West Ham with Nick Ames at 8pm. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cHe has supported Sheffield United through thick and thin going back to the 1950s and wishes nothing more than success for the club, its supporters and the many staff employed by it. Mr McCabe sincerely hopes that he is proved wrong in relation to his deep misgivings about the suitability of Prince Abdullah as an appropriate custodian of Sheffield United\u201d \u2013 a spokesman for Kevin McCabe after a high court ordered him to sell his 50% share in the Blades to fellow co-owner Prince Abdullah Bin Mosaad Bin Abdulaziz Al Saud for just \u00a35m. RECOMMENDED LISTENING Football Weekly will be round this way. FIVER LETTERS \u201cPerhaps I got a little wistful watching Handsome\u2019s Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores and his now superbly grey beard this weekend.

And Mr Roy reinventing his look with \u2026 er, wait, I\u2019ll stop there\u201d \u2013 Mike Wilner. \u201cRe: terrible pitches (Fiver passim). As a former inner-city five-a-side keeper, I have never played a competitive match on grass. For 18 bruising seasons our league games were played on solid concrete, covered by a ridiculously thin membrane that can only be described as Action Man hair. The mild inconvenience of a manhole, an oak tree, standing water or various dangerous but ultimately avoidable detritus cannot compare to continuously slamming your hips, knees and elbows on concrete every 30 seconds for 40 minutes each Thursday night. It is hell. On the plus side, qualifying for the regional cup competition meant playing on luscious 3G pitches. Proper footballers complain about the weird bounces and the bits of black rubber in your underpants but for me it was heaven\u201d \u2013 Jimmy O\u2019Brien.

NEWS, BITS AND BOBS Twelve leaders of hardcore Juventus \u2018ultra\u2019 fan groups have been arrested on suspicion of criminal association, money-laundering, violence and aggravated extortion in connection with ticket sales. Italian TV pundit Luciano Passirani has been sacked for saying that the only way to stop Romelu Lukaku is to give \u201chim 10 bananas to eat\u201d. Qui Studio a Voi Stadio director, Fabio Ravezzani, said Passirani had apologised but that that was not enough: \u201cMr Passirani is 80 years old and to compliment Lukaku he used a metaphor that turned out to be racist.\u201d Possibly the most protracted goalkeeper contract saga yet has come to an end with David de Gea trousering himself a new Manchester United contract until 2023. \u201cI could never have imagined I would play over 350 games for this club,\u201d he sighed, possibly a bit too on the nose. Arsenal being Arsenal against Watford has left Granit Xhaka admitting that the team were \u201cscared\u201d in the second half of Sunday\u2019s 2-2 draw. \u201cWe knew they would come at us and push us hard,\u201d he yelped. \u201cWe cannot give a performance like this.\u201d And James Maddison has got Brendan Rodgers drooling, despite Leicester\u2019s 1-0 defeat at Manchester United: \u201cHe has a lovely swagger, a lovely arrogance, and he is a good kid who will get better.

On Monday the judge\u2019s verdict arrived and he ruled in favour of Abdullah.</p> <p>Two weeks of arguments were made on both sides, plenty of it extremely heated.

In response SUL refused to sell its shares, arguing such a move invalidated the original deal. And ultimately that is how it ended up in court. </p> <p>SUL claimed Abdullah, through his lawyer Yusuf Giansiracusa, conspired to avoid buying the properties, causing loss to SUL. McCabe\u2019s side argued that \u201cstrong\u201d and \u201chighly charged\u201d emails sent by Giansiracusa were part of a broader scheme to provoke McCabe to accept the sale without the properties. UTB said McCabe, a long-term business owner, would not be concerned by heated email exchanges and that SUL had been involved in discussions with an American over the sale of the club, which would require UTB to be pushed out.</p> <p>There was a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/may/16/osama-bin-laden-sheffield-united-investor-talks\" title=\"\">headline-grabbing use of the Bin Laden name</a> during the court case when it was revealed Abdullah secured a \u00a33m loan from a relative of Osama bin Laden to help fund the club. The family member is a legitimate businessman without close links to the former al-Qaeda leader but McCabe claimed he never knew the original source of the money.</p> <p>SUL argued that Abdullah, the former owner of the Saudi club Al Hilal, was unfit to run Sheffield United and that the money was a bribe in relation to the prince\u2019s work in the Saudi government but the judge ruled this not to be the case. An investment expert told the court that the loan could be traced to Saleh Mohammed Bin Laden. It was said that Bin Laden considered investing in United but decided against doing so following due diligence, leading to the money being repaid.</p> <p>Paul Downes QC, representing SUL, asked the club\u2019s chief executive, Stephen Bettis, whether Chris Wilder would quit as manager if Abdullah took full control, although the judge interrupted to say \u201cspeculation was not going to help\u201d and was irrelevant. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4c79c9f33bff3f9f53d5831442a39aea56e21f69\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4c79c9f33bff3f9f53d5831442a39aea56e21f69/156_431_2251_1350/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sheffield United co-owner Kevin McCabe\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sheffield United co-owner Kevin McCabe.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Childs/Action Images via Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>McCabe said he was \u201cbitterly disappointed\u201d by the ruling, which dismissed his claim for damages and breach of contract, and said in a statement that it is \u201csimply heart breaking\u201d to lose connection with the football club he has supported since the 1950s. McCabe is seriously considering an appeal to Mr Justice Fancourt\u2019s decision to rule in the prince\u2019s favour. In the meantime McCabe said he \u201csincerely hopes that he is proved wrong in relation to his deep misgivings about the suitability of the Prince Abdullah as an appropriate custodian of Sheffield United\u201d.</p> <p>Wilder and Abdullah have met to discuss funding and transfers and are said to have built a positive working relationship. At the start of pre-season Wilder signed a new three-year contract, earning a significant pay rise which was signed off by the prince. Wilder and his wife have visited the prince\u2019s home to talk about plans for the future of the club.</p> <p>Despite the off-field distractions, the team have made a reasonable start on the pitch, earning five points from their five league games, leaving them 15th in the table, aided by the club breaking their transfer record four times over the summer, a spree capped off with the \u00a320m acquisition of the striker Oli McBurnie.</p> <p>Abdullah said in a statement after the verdict being announced that his first priority was to secure the club\u2019s top-flight status, aided by investment in the first team and academy, as well as facilities. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.</figcaption> </figure>",

SUL argued that Abdullah, the former owner of the Saudi club Al Hilal, was unfit to run Sheffield United and that the money was a bribe in relation to the prince\u2019s work in the Saudi government but the judge ruled this not to be the case. An investment expert told the court that the loan could be traced to Saleh Mohammed Bin Laden. It was said that Bin Laden considered investing in United but decided against doing so following due diligence, leading to the money being repaid. Paul Downes QC, representing SUL, asked the club\u2019s chief executive, Stephen Bettis, whether Chris Wilder would quit as manager if Abdullah took full control, although the judge interrupted to say \u201cspeculation was not going to help\u201d and was irrelevant. McCabe said he was \u201cbitterly disappointed\u201d by the ruling, which dismissed his claim for damages and breach of contract, and said in a statement that it is \u201csimply heart breaking\u201d to lose connection with the football club he has supported since the 1950s. McCabe is seriously considering an appeal to Mr Justice Fancourt\u2019s decision to rule in the prince\u2019s favour. In the meantime McCabe said he \u201csincerely hopes that he is proved wrong in relation to his deep misgivings about the suitability of the Prince Abdullah as an appropriate custodian of Sheffield United\u201d. Wilder and Abdullah have met to discuss funding and transfers and are said to have built a positive working relationship. At the start of pre-season Wilder signed a new three-year contract, earning a significant pay rise which was signed off by the prince. Wilder and his wife have visited the prince\u2019s home to talk about plans for the future of the club. Despite the off-field distractions, the team have made a reasonable start on the pitch, earning five points from their five league games, leaving them 15th in the table, aided by the club breaking their transfer record four times over the summer, a spree capped off with the \u00a320m acquisition of the striker Oli McBurnie. Abdullah said in a statement after the verdict being announced that his first priority was to secure the club\u2019s top-flight status, aided by investment in the first team and academy, as well as facilities.",

The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/burkini\">burkini</a>, which is a full-length swimsuit, is an innovative (and cheap) way of enabling girls in strict Muslim countries to get into the water without compromising their cultural and religious beliefs. The RNLI has been involved in the Panje Project with the majority of the RNLI\u2019s involvement funded by a donor who specifically wanted the money to go towards this project.</p> <p>\u201cThe Creches for Bangladesh programme helps reduce children\u2019s risk of drowning by ensuring they have close supervision throughout the day. About 40 children a day die from drowning in Bangladesh. Access to a free creche place reduces a child\u2019s risk of drowning by an incredible 82%.\u201d</p> <p>An RNLI spokesperson said: \u201cIn response to the recent media pieces about the lifesaving work we are doing overseas, we have been very encouraged to see a sharp increase in online donations, coupled with some very positive messages of support.

Others said they were setting up direct debits to support the work of the charity overseas and as a riposte to the coverage in the Times and MailOnline. It has been a difficult few weeks for the RNLI. In August, it warned that it faced a \u201cperfect storm\u201d of a shortfall of funds when it was busier than ever saving lives in the UK; last week it announced plans to cut 135 positions, including 95 permanent jobs. The Times carried the details of the RNLI\u2019s overseas spending in an article headlined: \u201cRNLI funding burkinis for Africans while cutting jobs.\u201d Part of MailOnline\u2019s headline read: \u201cHow \u00a33.3m of donations to lifeboat charity are spent abroad including aid for Tanzania swimmers and creches in Bangladesh.\u201d The RNLI reacted by publishing a long statement in which it explained it had always been dedicated to reducing drowning not just in the UK but across the globe. It pointed out that its founder, Sir William Hillary, had the vision that we \u201cshould extend our views [of drowning prevention] from our own immediate coasts, to the most remote quarters of the globe, and to every neighbouring state\u201d. The statement said: \u201cWe currently spend less than 2% of the RNLI\u2019s total annual expenditure on our international drowning prevention activity and we actively seek donations specifically for this work, including [from] the Isle of Man\u2019s international development fund and Department for International Development in the UK, both of which have made substantial donations to our international work this year.\u201d It denied the suggestion it had not been clear with supporters that some of its funds went abroad. \u201cWe greatly value our supporters and have not misled them. The RNLI\u2019s international work has been reported in detail in our annual reports going back several years and information is also available from the RNLI website and regularly reported elsewhere.\u201d It went into detail about two projects mentioned in the articles. \u201cThe Panje Project teaches women swim survival skills in Zanzibar. The burkini, which is a full-length swimsuit, is an innovative (and cheap) way of enabling girls in strict Muslim countries to get into the water without compromising their cultural and religious beliefs. The RNLI has been involved in the Panje Project with the majority of the RNLI\u2019s involvement funded by a donor who specifically wanted the money to go towards this project. \u201cThe Creches for Bangladesh programme helps reduce children\u2019s risk of drowning by ensuring they have close supervision throughout the day. About 40 children a day die from drowning in Bangladesh. Access to a free creche place reduces a child\u2019s risk of drowning by an incredible 82%.\u201d An RNLI spokesperson said: \u201cIn response to the recent media pieces about the lifesaving work we are doing overseas, we have been very encouraged to see a sharp increase in online donations, coupled with some very positive messages of support. But this is such a polarising issue, and we have also received some very negative responses, including people contacting our supporter care team requesting to withdraw or reduce their support for the charity. \u201cThe volume of responses we have received on this matter is vast and ongoing \u2013 the overall picture is changing constantly at the moment, so it may be several weeks before we have a full understanding of its impact on donations to the RNLI.\u201d On Twitter, one donor said: \u201cThey have had so many donations the site has crashed. It took me a while yesterday to make my donation but it went through in the end.\u201d Another added: \u201cMy monthly DD [direct debit] starts this month. You\u2019ll come out of this stronger and more respected than ever.\u201d The RNLI tweeted: \u201cThank you to everyone who has sent messages of support and made donations to us over the past 24 hours \u2013 we simply couldn\u2019t save lives without our amazing supporters.\u201d",

The moment of brilliance came when, at the end of each screening, the silvery Tyvek curtain walls of the auditorium were unexpectedly whisked up, leaving the audience exposed on the side of a busy main road for all passing traffic to see.

Offering boarding accommodation for 540 pupils, the two identical buildings each consist of a vast roof, stretching 165 metres by 65 metres, supported on a forest of slender wooden columns above a village of freestanding dormitory rooms, built of mud bricks dug from the site. The little rooms are designed with perforated, breathable walls, allowing natural cross-ventilation, and are connected by an upper level of wooden walkways and play decks, creating an airy veranda with the feeling of a meandering treehouse. <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/nov/21/children-village-brazilian-school-riba-international-prize-best-building-in-the-world\">Read more here</a></em>.</p> <h2>23</h2> <h2><strong>Muzeum Susch, Switzerland</strong> (2019)</h2> <p>Alpine chalet, primitive grotto and Bond villain\u2019s lair in one, Voellmy Schmidlin\u2019s Muzeum Susch is one of the most unusual and evocative spaces for art that has been built in recent years. It is located on the site of a 12th-century monastery in a rambling complex of buildings that formerly housed a vicarage, hospice and brewery, supplemented by a series of dramatic subterranean spaces that have been dynamited out of the mountainside. Combining local vernacular techniques with crisp new additions, the young architects have created a magical place where the historic fabric, contemporary art and raw geology of the landscape collide. <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/jan/22/muzeum-susch-switzerland-art-gallery-cave\">Read more here</a></em>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"dabc69c6b1ab6406610bae93818af640d499f08f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dabc69c6b1ab6406610bae93818af640d499f08f/0_0_3543_1879/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The prayer hall at Bait ur Rouf Mosque Dhaka, Bangladesh.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"530\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mesmerising pattern \u2026 the prayer hall at Bait ur Rouf Mosque Dhaka, Bangladesh.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sandro di Carlo Darsa/MTA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>22</h2> <h2><strong>Bait Ur Rouf Mosque, Dhaka, Bangladesh</strong> (2012)</h2> <p>Tucked into the corner of a city block in the dense Bangladeshi capital of Dhaka, this little brick mosque by Marina Tabassum is a poetic essay on how natural light can be used to maximum effect. Formed from a square concrete pavilion that is surrounded by a cylindrical brick drum, in turn enclosed in a perforated brick cube, the gaps between the geometries allow shafts of light to wash over the walls from above, while the ceiling of the central prayer hall is punctured by a constellation of holes that cast a mesmerising dappled pattern across the bare floor.</p> <h2>21</h2> <h2><strong>Blue House, London, UK</strong> (2002)</h2> <p>On a side street in Hackney, standing like a clapboard billboard, the Blue House by FAT signalled the revival of wit, humour and reference in architecture, coming as a bold breath of fresh air in the early 00s, when postmodernism was still a dirty word. A literal interpretation of a live-work building, its facade combines the iconography of an office block and a suburban home as a stage-set cutout, masking a complex interior that nods to <a href=\"https://www.dezeen.com/2018/09/20/opinion-tribute-robert-venturi-architecture-sean-griffiths/\">Venturi Scott Brown</a> and <a href=\"https://www.archdaily.com/576187/spotlight-adolf-loos\">Adolf Loos</a>, with winding stairs, window seats and carefully layered spaces. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/architecture-design-blog/2013/dec/17/fat-architecture-break-up\">Read more here</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6cc4601a354ca20373a23a9d17e7f89f1ca8b026\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6cc4601a354ca20373a23a9d17e7f89f1ca8b026/0_188_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Teshima Art Museum, Japan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cave \u2026 Teshima Art Museum, Japan</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Isabel Choat</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>20</h2> <h2><strong>Teshima Art Museum, Japan</strong> (2010)</h2> <p>A cosmic bubble of white concrete bulging out of the ground, the Teshima Art Museum by Ryue Nishizawa is less a museum than an art installation. Visitors enter the space shoeless, through a narrow funnel, to be swallowed by a dreamy white world where the 25cm-thick concrete shell forms a vast 40 metre x 60 metre cave lit by two oval apertures. A site-specific work by artist <a href=\"https://www.japansociety.org/event/a-room-of-her-own-rei-naito-and-light\">Rei Naito</a> sees droplets of water seep through the ground from tiny springs, forming glistening rivulets that trickle across the floor.

K\u00e9r\u00e9 designed the primary school while he was a student in Germany, and it embodies his low-energy, low-cost principles: a pair of simple rectangular volumes made of mud bricks, crowned with a \u201cflying roof\u201d of vaulted corrugated metal, providing extra shade and encouraging air flow.

Created with Ai Weiwei, its taut latticework shell of crisscrossing columns and beams creates a beguiling space between the pitch and the plaza outside, a Piranesian world of dramatic flying staircases and secluded corners, washed by a feverish play of light and shadows. The open structure allows crowds to filter in from all sides, drawing people into the atmospheric glade of tilting steel trunks, a world apart from the usual cattle-herding arena infrastructure. <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/feb/11/architecture.chinaarts2008\">Read more here</a></em>.</p> <h2>16</h2> <h2><strong>Bruder-Klaus Field </strong><strong>chapel, Mechernich, Germany</strong> (2007)</h2> <p>This is the ultimate in elemental shrines by the architect\u2019s architect, the reclusive mountain-dwelling mystic Peter Zumthor. An enigmatic concrete tower stands in a field, with a layered, sedimentary texture, as if hewn from the Earth. Walk through a triangular opening and you find a gnarled, blackened cave that tapers to a teardrop roof light. It is the product of a suitably witchy ritual: concrete was cast over a pyramidal pyre of tree trunks, then the wood was burned out from within.

Nestled in a bucolic landscape on the edge of Hangzhou, the 20 buildings for studying, working and living fuse ancient traditions of Chinese architecture with a strikingly modern outlook, reusing more than 2m salvaged tiles and bricks from the site to form a richly textured collage of materials, combining finely crafted timber elements with rugged, rough-cast concrete.

More than seven years late and 10 times over budget, it finally proved to be worth the pain. It stands as an ocean liner of architectural virtuosity, with an eye-watering level of bespoke craftsmanship that few other buildings of the century can match.

      "bodyText": "25 Cineroleum, London, UK (2010) There have been few moments of architectural theatre as strange and wonderful as the Cineroleum, a temporary cinema erected in a disused petrol station on Clerkenwell Road one summer. The moment of brilliance came when, at the end of each screening, the silvery Tyvek curtain walls of the auditorium were unexpectedly whisked up, leaving the audience exposed on the side of a busy main road for all passing traffic to see. Fun handmade details included decorative ceiling tiles vacuum-formed on site and intricate Formica marquetry tables and stools, setting the tone for Assemble collectives\u2019s signature low-cost craft.

Offering boarding accommodation for 540 pupils, the two identical buildings each consist of a vast roof, stretching 165 metres by 65 metres, supported on a forest of slender wooden columns above a village of freestanding dormitory rooms, built of mud bricks dug from the site. The little rooms are designed with perforated, breathable walls, allowing natural cross-ventilation, and are connected by an upper level of wooden walkways and play decks, creating an airy veranda with the feeling of a meandering treehouse. Read more here. 23 Muzeum Susch, Switzerland (2019) Alpine chalet, primitive grotto and Bond villain\u2019s lair in one, Voellmy Schmidlin\u2019s Muzeum Susch is one of the most unusual and evocative spaces for art that has been built in recent years. It is located on the site of a 12th-century monastery in a rambling complex of buildings that formerly housed a vicarage, hospice and brewery, supplemented by a series of dramatic subterranean spaces that have been dynamited out of the mountainside. Combining local vernacular techniques with crisp new additions, the young architects have created a magical place where the historic fabric, contemporary art and raw geology of the landscape collide. Read more here. 22 Bait Ur Rouf Mosque, Dhaka, Bangladesh (2012) Tucked into the corner of a city block in the dense Bangladeshi capital of Dhaka, this little brick mosque by Marina Tabassum is a poetic essay on how natural light can be used to maximum effect. Formed from a square concrete pavilion that is surrounded by a cylindrical brick drum, in turn enclosed in a perforated brick cube, the gaps between the geometries allow shafts of light to wash over the walls from above, while the ceiling of the central prayer hall is punctured by a constellation of holes that cast a mesmerising dappled pattern across the bare floor. 21 Blue House, London, UK (2002) On a side street in Hackney, standing like a clapboard billboard, the Blue House by FAT signalled the revival of wit, humour and reference in architecture, coming as a bold breath of fresh air in the early 00s, when postmodernism was still a dirty word. A literal interpretation of a live-work building, its facade combines the iconography of an office block and a suburban home as a stage-set cutout, masking a complex interior that nods to Venturi Scott Brown and Adolf Loos, with winding stairs, window seats and carefully layered spaces. Read more here. 20 Teshima Art Museum, Japan (2010) A cosmic bubble of white concrete bulging out of the ground, the Teshima Art Museum by Ryue Nishizawa is less a museum than an art installation. Visitors enter the space shoeless, through a narrow funnel, to be swallowed by a dreamy white world where the 25cm-thick concrete shell forms a vast 40 metre x 60 metre cave lit by two oval apertures. A site-specific work by artist Rei Naito sees droplets of water seep through the ground from tiny springs, forming glistening rivulets that trickle across the floor. Soft, sensual minimalism at its most distilled. 19 Gando School, Burkina Faso (2001-12) The \u201crural high-tech\u201d school buildings Francis K\u00e9r\u00e9 has built in his home village of Gando, 125 miles south-east of Burkina Faso\u2019s capital of Ouagadougou, stand as a compelling, climate-conscious alternative to steel, glass and air-conditioning. K\u00e9r\u00e9 designed the primary school while he was a student in Germany, and it embodies his low-energy, low-cost principles: a pair of simple rectangular volumes made of mud bricks, crowned with a \u201cflying roof\u201d of vaulted corrugated metal, providing extra shade and encouraging air flow. A model of gadget-free ecological elegance.

From its gently undulating bamboo ceiling, to its forest of rainbow-coloured branching columns, to the large circular openings that bring daylight deep into its lower levels, itprovides a soothing balm for the stresses of international travel. Designed with Estudio Lamela, it has a calming quality that is hard to convey in photographs, from the soft acoustic to the merciful lack of fluorescent lighting. 17 Beijing National Stadium, China (2008) The most dazzling Olympic stadium of modern times, Herzog &amp; de Meuron\u2019s Beijing Bird\u2019s Nest is far more sophisticated than simply a symbol of China\u2019s emerging nationalist might. Created with Ai Weiwei, its taut latticework shell of crisscrossing columns and beams creates a beguiling space between the pitch and the plaza outside, a Piranesian world of dramatic flying staircases and secluded corners, washed by a feverish play of light and shadows. The open structure allows crowds to filter in from all sides, drawing people into the atmospheric glade of tilting steel trunks, a world apart from the usual cattle-herding arena infrastructure. Read more here. 16 Bruder-Klaus Field chapel, Mechernich, Germany (2007) This is the ultimate in elemental shrines by the architect\u2019s architect, the reclusive mountain-dwelling mystic Peter Zumthor. An enigmatic concrete tower stands in a field, with a layered, sedimentary texture, as if hewn from the Earth. Walk through a triangular opening and you find a gnarled, blackened cave that tapers to a teardrop roof light. It is the product of a suitably witchy ritual: concrete was cast over a pyramidal pyre of tree trunks, then the wood was burned out from within. The result is wonderfully primal. Read more here. 15 Peckham Library, London, UK (2000) Standing on the edge of a square as a bright green inverted L-shape crowned with a jaunty orange beret, the Peckham Library by Will Alsop summed up an era of millennial optimism. It features a double-height reading room raised on the architect\u2019s trademark wonky columns, with a seductive interior landscape of curvaceous wooden pods on angled stilts. It captured the public imagination and had the desired effect of attracting younger readers: the library welcomes three times the borough\u2019s average of 15- to 17-year-old members. Read more here. 14 Xiangshan Campus, China Academy of Art, Hangzhou (2002-13) A poetic rallying cry for craft in the face of China\u2019s rapid urbanisation, the Xiangshan Campus has a timeless air. Nestled in a bucolic landscape on the edge of Hangzhou, the 20 buildings for studying, working and living fuse ancient traditions of Chinese architecture with a strikingly modern outlook, reusing more than 2m salvaged tiles and bricks from the site to form a richly textured collage of materials, combining finely crafted timber elements with rugged, rough-cast concrete. Designed by Amateur Architecture Studio, it marked the emergence of a new vernacular that the country\u2019s younger generation of architects have since embraced. Read more here. 13 Sala Beckett, Barcelona, Spain (2014) An ingenious reworking of a 1920s workers\u2019 club into a new theatre, the Sala Beckett shows how adaptive reuse can be a magical art form and how materials can be mined from a site and redeployed with added value. Think John Soane meets Gordon Matta-Clark. Architects Flores y Prats conducted an exhaustive archaeological survey of every element of the building before taking their chainsaw and scalpel to remake it in the most exquisite bricolage, crafting a place that revels in the layers of history once latent in the site.

Conceived as a great doughnut with a playground deck on the roof through which climbable tree trunks poke, it is designed to encourage freeform learning. Sliding doors allow the classrooms to be opened up to the playground, while gargoyles channel rainwater, creating waterfalls for kids to play in during wet weather. The kind of building that makes you wish you were four again.

The terraced design provided a basic concrete frame, with kitchen, bathroom and a roof, allowing residents to fill in the gaps and stamp their own identity on their homes in the process. The value of the properties has since increased five-fold, while the model has been rolled out in different forms across South America.

More than seven years late and 10 times over budget, it finally proved to be worth the pain. It stands as an ocean liner of architectural virtuosity, with an eye-watering level of bespoke craftsmanship that few other buildings of the century can match. From the curved escalator-ride entrance sequence through a spangle-studded tunnel to the hand-blown glass lamps and coral-like surface of the auditorium, it is a camp temple of wonder. Read more here. 9 UTEC university campus, Lima, Peru (2015) Built with the muscular solidity of a building from another era, Grafton Architects\u2019 new campus for UTEC university has the raw mineral heft of a geological formation. Huge concrete fins march along the spine of the building, supporting laboratories and classrooms and rising up on either side of a nave-like void that provides a social route through the complex. Heroic yet intimate, its aerial ballet of staggered terraces and flying walkways creates an enticing network of open-air spaces to sit and meet, embracing the outdoor possibilities of the local climate. Read more here. 8 Vasconcelos Library and Botanical Gardens, Mexico City, Mexico (2007) Going to look for a book has never been so thrilling. Walking into the lofty hall of Alberto Kalach\u2019s Vasconcelos Library, it\u2019s impossible not to be awed by the hanging stacks of shelves that climb either side, forming a vertiginous Blade Runner metropolis of books. This deep, multilevel canyon is crisscrossed by gantries, cantilevered staircases and projecting platforms, while reading areas enjoy natural light at the edges of the building, with views of the lush botanical gardens. One of the most exhilarating interiors of the century. 7 Casa da M\u00fasica, Porto, Portugal (2005) Looking like a faceted concrete meteorite that crash-landed on the edge of a roundabout in Porto, the Casa da M\u00fasica by OMA is one of the most spirited cultural buildings of the century. Its cascading aluminium stairs draw you into a world of twisting spatial drama, where a public route spirals up around the central auditorium, offering views through rippling glass walls.

A wafer-thin halo hovers over a complex of different-sized galleries and community facilities housed in discreet cubic pavilions, arranged on a street-like grid and forming a jumbled labyrinth through which visitors may drift. Punctuated by open courtyards, the little village of white cubes is enclosed in a diaphanous bubble of glass, providing constant connection with landscape outside. It is built with a delicacy and precision rarely matched elsewhere. 5 High Line, New York, US (2009-14) No landscape project has spawned as many imitators as the High Line, the transformation of an abandoned elevated railway into a public park along the west side of Manhattan\u2019s Meatpacking District by James Corner Field Operations and Diller Scofidio + Renfro. Its true power lies in providing visitors with a different perspective of the city, allowing people to float above the congested streets on a linear green lung with unexpected views along the way. It\u2019s almost too popular for its own good, having become a teeming tourist trap and unintentionally catalysed the rapid gentrification of the surrounding area.

Nkululeko Zulu and Hani Gue took the Ministry of Defence (MoD) to a tribunal claiming it had failed to take reasonable steps to prevent discrimination and harassment against them. On the morning of 23 January last year, Gue was in Zulu\u2019s room having a cup of tea when a colleague came to join them and noticed that three photographs on the door to Gue\u2019s room had been defaced. One photo of Gue and Zulu had been defaced with a swastika and the words \u201cfuck off\u201d, while someone had drawn a swastika and a Hitler moustache on another image of Gue. On a photograph of Gue, Zulu and another (white) private, the N-word had been written across Gue and Zulu. The tribunal heard that Zulu and Gue, whose rooms were opposite each other, had accommodation in a block in a barracks that was accessible only by key. In a written judgment, the employment judge Richard Baty said the graffiti \u201cmust have been done by a member of 3 Para\u201d. He said: \u201cThe conduct was unquestionably unwanted; the graffiti in question was of the most unpleasant nature, set out on Mr Gue\u2019s personal photographs and was racially highly offensive.\u201d He added: \u201cNotwithstanding the fact that the perpetrator is still unknown and was not before the tribunal to give an account of his/her motivation, we find that the carrying out of this act was so unpleasant that it can only have been done with the purpose of violating the claimants\u2019 dignity and creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating and offensive environment for them.\u201d It was also found, as a matter of fact: A Sergeant B, who has since left the army, referred to Zulu with a grave racial epithet in front of virtually the whole platoon in 2014. Gue\u2019s accommodation was vandalised, including racist slurs being written on the doors, by a member or members of 3 Para in 2013-14. A member or members of 3 Para posted a photograph of personnel on Facebook in July 2017 with a Nazi flag as a backdrop. However, Baty said the first two of these incidents were presented too late to form the basis of a successful claim and the last \u201cdid not have the effect of violating either claimant\u2019s dignity\u201d. Gue, who described himself as a black African of Ugandan nationality, joined the army in October 2012 and was later assigned to the 3rd Battalion (3 Para) A Company. He formally asked to leave in January 2018. Zulu, who served as a lance corporal in the Parachute Regiment and described himself as black South African, joined the army in June 2008 and formally applied to leave the forces almost 10 years later.

The Judicial Power Project at the thinktank Policy Exchange has argued that judges are usurping parliament\u2019s powers through excessive \u201cjudicial activism\u201d.

It brought an end to the system of appealing to the \"lords of appeal in ordinary\" - commonly known as the law lords.</p>\n    <p>The court comprises the president and deputy president and 10 other judges of the supreme court. Judges are appointed by the Queen on the advice of the prime minister, to whom a name is recommended by a special selection commission.

      "bodyText": "The supreme court hearing on the suspension of parliament by Boris Johnson will test the foundations of the UK\u2019s unwritten constitution with arguments about the respective powers of parliament, the courts and the government. Should judges be able to make such politically sensitive decisions? One of the keys issues is about \u201cjusticiability\u201d, or whether the prime minister\u2019s use of the royal prerogative should be subject to legal scrutiny. The Judicial Power Project at the thinktank Policy Exchange has argued that judges are usurping parliament\u2019s powers through excessive \u201cjudicial activism\u201d. Prof Richard Ekins, the head of the project, argued this week that \u201cproroguing parliament in no way flouts parliamentary sovereignty\u201d. But many legal experts point out judicial reviews frequently involve political matters. Mark Elliott, professor of law at Cambridge University, has stated that the high court in London\u2019s view that the \u201cpolitical\u201d nature of the issue shields it from judicial review is entirely wide of the mark.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson said that Vote Leave would lose the EU referendum just minutes before appearing on television to declare his intention to campaign to exit, David Cameron has claimed. In an interview with ITV News, the former UK prime minister disclosed that Johnson had told him the campaign to leave the EU would be \u201ccrushed like a toad under the harrow\u201d. Minutes later, Johnson appeared outside his then family home in Islington, north London, to say he would join the Vote Leave team during the 2016 referendum. The timing of their exchange will be seized upon as further evidence that Johnson was surprised by the eventual result which brought down Cameron and finally led to Johnson himself taking over as PM. Cameron said: \u201cI spoke to him [Johnson] at length about it and I said, \u2018Boris you\u2019ve never been in favour of leaving the EU, so why now there\u2019s a better deal on offer, are you in favour of leaving now?\u2019\u201d \u201cHe thought that the Brexit vote would be lost but he didn\u2019t want to give up the chance of being on the romantic, patriotic, nationalistic side of Brexit. \u201cMinutes before he went out to explain why he was going to be on the side of Brexit, he sent me a text saying, \u2018Brexit will be crushed like a toad under the harrow\u2019 but I can only conclude that \u2013 he\u2019d never argued for it before \u2013 he thought it was going to lose and that\u2019s why he made the choice.\u201d Cameron believed Johnson thought the Brexit vote would be lost but that backing it would be better for his long-term premiership ambitions. \u201cHe\u2019d never argued for it before and so why argue for it when there\u2019s a better deal on offer \u2013 and as I put to him, there will be another treaty, another renegotiation.

      "body": "<p>My friend and colleague of more than 50 years, Willy Brown, who has died aged 74, was an expert in industrial relations, holding chairs in the subject at both the University of Warwick and the University of Cambridge.</p> <p>He was also an academic administrator who took up senior positions in scholarly associations, governmental bodies and at Cambridge, including being master of <a href=\"https://www.darwin.cam.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">Darwin College</a>. His research, policy formulation, and, perhaps above all, his humanity and decency, made him one of the most influential academics of his generation.</p> <p>The concept of \u201cfairness\u201d was central to his research. He believed workplace representatives were motivated not by political militancy but by a desire to create stability in pay and other matters when management had abdicated responsibility, preferring to rely on payment systems that simply saw workers as there to maximise earnings. The result, in his view, was that employers got the unions they deserved.</p> <p>He was a founding member of the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/low-pay-commission\" title=\"\">Low Pay Commission,</a> which introduced the national minimum wage in 1999. The success of the LPC in enhancing the NMW over the past 20 years, without producing either unemployment or inflation, largely stems from its structure of social partnership \u2013 in which Willy played an important role as a mediator \u2013 and its methodology of rigorous research, solid statistics and academic integrity, which he was instrumental in introducing.</p> <p>His mediation skills were also often used by the Advisory Conciliation and Arbitration Service, on whose council he served. And, despite being a modest person, he could not conceal his delight at the implicit compliment when Acas asked him to mediate a dispute between its own management and staff.</p> <p>Although much of his research was informed by fieldwork case studies, he was the driving force in launching large-scale, representative employment relations surveys in the UK, which led to the government\u2019s flagship Workplace Employment Relations Study and to similar surveys in Australia and Canada.</p> <p>Willy was born in Oxford, the son of the economist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/mar/12/guardianobituaries.obituaries\" title=\"\">Arthur Brown</a>, and Joan (nee Taylor), a linguist and teacher. After attending Leeds grammar school on a scholarship, he went to Wadham College, Oxford, where he studied philosophy, politics and economics. He was on the staff of Warwick University between 1968 and 1985, and was Montague Burton professor of industrial relations at Cambridge University from 1985 until his retirement in 2012.</p> <p>Willy\u2019s research, communicated in clear and elegant prose, will have a lasting impact on the field of industrial relations.</p> <p>So, too, will his academic generosity in sharing authorship, his collegiality that produced so many friends and his mentorship of numerous students in the UK and many other countries, including Canada, Australia and China.</p> <p>Willy is survived by his second wife, Jackie Scott, a professor, whom he married in 2017, and her daughters, Sarah and Rachel; two stepdaughters, Rachel and Sarah, from his first marriage, to Kim Hewitt, which ended in divorce; six grandchildren; and his older brother Henry.</p>",

      "bodyText": "My friend and colleague of more than 50 years, Willy Brown, who has died aged 74, was an expert in industrial relations, holding chairs in the subject at both the University of Warwick and the University of Cambridge. He was also an academic administrator who took up senior positions in scholarly associations, governmental bodies and at Cambridge, including being master of Darwin College. His research, policy formulation, and, perhaps above all, his humanity and decency, made him one of the most influential academics of his generation. The concept of \u201cfairness\u201d was central to his research. He believed workplace representatives were motivated not by political militancy but by a desire to create stability in pay and other matters when management had abdicated responsibility, preferring to rely on payment systems that simply saw workers as there to maximise earnings. The result, in his view, was that employers got the unions they deserved. He was a founding member of the Low Pay Commission, which introduced the national minimum wage in 1999. The success of the LPC in enhancing the NMW over the past 20 years, without producing either unemployment or inflation, largely stems from its structure of social partnership \u2013 in which Willy played an important role as a mediator \u2013 and its methodology of rigorous research, solid statistics and academic integrity, which he was instrumental in introducing. His mediation skills were also often used by the Advisory Conciliation and Arbitration Service, on whose council he served. And, despite being a modest person, he could not conceal his delight at the implicit compliment when Acas asked him to mediate a dispute between its own management and staff. Although much of his research was informed by fieldwork case studies, he was the driving force in launching large-scale, representative employment relations surveys in the UK, which led to the government\u2019s flagship Workplace Employment Relations Study and to similar surveys in Australia and Canada. Willy was born in Oxford, the son of the economist Arthur Brown, and Joan (nee Taylor), a linguist and teacher. After attending Leeds grammar school on a scholarship, he went to Wadham College, Oxford, where he studied philosophy, politics and economics. He was on the staff of Warwick University between 1968 and 1985, and was Montague Burton professor of industrial relations at Cambridge University from 1985 until his retirement in 2012. Willy\u2019s research, communicated in clear and elegant prose, will have a lasting impact on the field of industrial relations. So, too, will his academic generosity in sharing authorship, his collegiality that produced so many friends and his mentorship of numerous students in the UK and many other countries, including Canada, Australia and China. Willy is survived by his second wife, Jackie Scott, a professor, whom he married in 2017, and her daughters, Sarah and Rachel; two stepdaughters, Rachel and Sarah, from his first marriage, to Kim Hewitt, which ended in divorce; six grandchildren; and his older brother Henry.",

      "bodyText": "An Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD) politician has walked out of an interview and threatened a journalist after he was confronted with parallels between his rhetoric and that of Adolf Hitler. An interview with Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6cke by the state broadcaster ZDF, recorded last week but screened on Sunday, shows the AfD politician threatening \u201cmassive consequences\u201d to a journalist who refused to restart an interview after a series of difficult questions. The interview started with a segment in which a number of AfD politicians were read a quotation from H\u00f6cke and asked if it was from their party colleague, the figurehead of the AfD\u2019s hardline nationalist wing, or from Hitler\u2019s Mein Kampf. Five AfD delegates said they could not tell if the line \u201cWhen the turning point is reached, then we Germans won\u2019t do things by halves, we will dispose of the rubbish heaps of modernity\u201d was from H\u00f6cke or Hitler, and one delegate said the line was more likely to be from Mein Kampf. H\u00f6cke is his party\u2019s lead candidate in the state of Thuringia, in the former East Germany, where polls predict the AfD gaining 20-24% of the vote in state elections on 27 October. In May 2018, an AfD tribunal ruled that H\u00f6cke was allowed to stay in the party in spite of controversial remarks about the culture of Holocaust remembrance. The revival of language long banished from conversations in Germany because of its association with the Nazi era has been a constant feature of the rise of the rightwing populist party, which originally grew out of protest against the decision to commit German taxpayer money to a bailout of Greece in 2013. The previous AfD leader, Frauke Petry, in 2016 called for the term v\u00f6lkisch be rehabilitated and wiped of its negative connotation \u2013 only to leave the party soon after, in protest against the growing influence of H\u00f6cke\u2019s v\u00f6lkisch wing of politicians following a more hardline nationalist course. In the ZDF interview, the journalist David Gebhard asked H\u00f6cke, a former history teacher, whether his use of terms with overt Nazi associations, such as entartet (\u201cdegenerate\u201d), Volksverderber (\u201ccorruptor of the people\u201d) and Lebensraum (\u201cliving space\u201d) were accidental or part of a deliberate strategy. H\u00f6cke replied that he was in favour of politicians who expressed themselves \u201cin original ways\u201d, while also criticising the development of the German language and the growing influence of English. About 10 minutes into the interview, the AfD politician\u2019s adviser interrupted the broadcast, asking for a restart because the questions had \u201cstrongly emotionally charged\u201d the interviewee. H\u00f6cke complained that politicians from other parties would never been confronted with a similar Hitler comparison, seemingly using the term Altparteien \u2013 a term used by Joseph Goebbels to discredit the established \u201cold parties\u201d of the Weimar republic. When ZDF refused to restart the interview, H\u00f6cke walked out, warning the journalist that he could yet become a \u201cpolitically interesting person in this country\u201d. An essay by the author Niklas Frank, published last week in the magazine Der Spiegel, accused the AfD of using the same rhetorical manoeuvres as his father, Hitler\u2019s governor general in occupied Poland, and cites H\u00f6cke\u2019s likening of the Holocaust memorial in Berlin to a \u201cmonument of shame\u201d as a prime example.",

      "body": "<p>Demonstrators have staged a protest outside a court in Rabat to coincide with the latest hearing in the trial of a Moroccan journalist accused of undergoing an illegal abortion and having sex before marriage.</p> <p>In a letter written from prison, Hajar Raissouni said the charges were fabricated and motivated by her work, which had been critical of the government.</p> <p>Raissouni, who works for one of Morocco\u2019s few independent media outlets, has been lauded for her coverage of mass demonstrations in the Berber-speaking Rif region in the country\u2019s north.</p> <p>Raissouni is standing trial alongside her fiance and the medical staff accused of performing an abortion. It has sparked fierce criticism from a wide spectrum of Moroccan society, amid accusations that the authorities have abused the country\u2019s laws to target women and crack down on free speech.</p> <p>Raissouni was stopped outside a clinic in Rabat on 31 August by six plainclothes police officers who questioned her about whether she had undergone an abortion. She and her fiance, professor Rifaat al-Amin, were detained along with the doctor accused of performing the procedure and two clinic staff members, who told investigators they had performed a routine medical procedure on Raissouni to remove a blood clot.</p> <p>After her arrest, the journalist was forced to submit to a vaginal examination against her will to determine whether she had undergone an abortion.

      "bodyText": "Demonstrators have staged a protest outside a court in Rabat to coincide with the latest hearing in the trial of a Moroccan journalist accused of undergoing an illegal abortion and having sex before marriage. In a letter written from prison, Hajar Raissouni said the charges were fabricated and motivated by her work, which had been critical of the government. Raissouni, who works for one of Morocco\u2019s few independent media outlets, has been lauded for her coverage of mass demonstrations in the Berber-speaking Rif region in the country\u2019s north. Raissouni is standing trial alongside her fiance and the medical staff accused of performing an abortion. It has sparked fierce criticism from a wide spectrum of Moroccan society, amid accusations that the authorities have abused the country\u2019s laws to target women and crack down on free speech. Raissouni was stopped outside a clinic in Rabat on 31 August by six plainclothes police officers who questioned her about whether she had undergone an abortion. She and her fiance, professor Rifaat al-Amin, were detained along with the doctor accused of performing the procedure and two clinic staff members, who told investigators they had performed a routine medical procedure on Raissouni to remove a blood clot. After her arrest, the journalist was forced to submit to a vaginal examination against her will to determine whether she had undergone an abortion. Despite evidence to the contrary, she faces two years in prison for having an illegal abortion and sex before marriage, which is also criminalised in Morocco. Mohammed Jamal Belkeziz, the doctor accused of performing the abortion, was previously decorated by King Mohammed VI of Morocco but now faces up to a decade in prison over the charges. Campaigners described the trial as a slap in the face to claims that Morocco is making progress on women\u2019s rights. They say that up to 800 abortions are performed daily in Morocco, where abortion is illegal except in cases where the woman\u2019s life is threatened due to pregnancy. Laila Slassi, a Moroccan lawyer, said: \u201cWe usually say that Morocco doesn\u2019t accept abortion and that it\u2019s illegal, but usually the police are fairly tolerant of it.\u201d Slassi is a founding member of the Masaktach feminist collective, whose name translates as \u201cI am not silent\u201d. Prosecutor Abdelslam Imani told the New York Times that it was not the case that the authorities had targeted Raissouni because of her journalism, and claimed that the clinic she visited was under surveillance to see if it was performing illegal abortions. But Slassi said: \u201cThe fact that she is a journalist and from a family that has caused some trouble for the Moroccan regime is probably the real reason why they\u2019re using some pretext against her.\u201d She said Raissouni\u2019s case highlighted the failure of the Moroccan state to protect women and freedom of the press. Slass said: \u201cBut these all fall under the same bigger right, which is the respect for the rule of law.\u201d Loubna Rais, also from Masaktach, said: \u201cThis is an attack on free speech using gendered law.

It brought an end to the system of appealing to the \"lords of appeal in ordinary\" - commonly known as the law lords.</p>\n    <p>The court comprises the president and deputy president and 10 other judges of the supreme court.

The London high court unanimously dismissed the prorogation claim while the Scottish appeal court unanimously allowed the challenge.</p> \n<p>Three days have been allocated for legal argument and judgment could well be reserved.

      "bodyText": "Eleven supreme court justices will hear the politically charged claim that Boris Johnson acted unlawfully in advising the Queen to suspend parliament for five weeks in order to stifle debate over the Brexit crisis. All but one of the judges on the UK\u2019s highest court will be on the bench on Tuesday when the case opens. The hearing will be livestreamed on the supreme court website. A decision last Friday to increase the number of judges from nine to 11 signifies its constitutional significance and may indicate how finely balanced the arguments are considered to be. It is the first time the supreme court has been summoned for an emergency hearing outside legal term-time and only the second occasion for such judicial mass mobilisation \u2013 a similar number of judges sat in 2016 for the article 50 case. Lady Hale, the first female president of the court who retires next January, will preside. Her deputy, Lord Reed, a Scottish judge, will succeed her in the new year. The only member of the 12-judge court not sitting will be Lord Briggs, a commercial law expert; the bench must have an odd number to prevent being deadlocked in a draw. One of the many difficulties the justices face is how to reconcile differences between English, Scottish and Northern Ireland laws in the context of similar challenges against the prime minister\u2019s proroguing of parliament. The London high court unanimously dismissed the prorogation claim while the Scottish appeal court unanimously allowed the challenge. Three days have been allocated for legal argument and judgment could well be reserved. Due to the complexity of the hearings, the government will be represented by several QCs, among whom are Sir James Eadie, the \u201cTreasury devil\u201d, who appears for ministers in major litigation battles, and Lord Keen of Elie, the advocate general for Scotland and Ministry of Justice spokesperson in the Lords. Eadie will lead on the English cases, Keen on the Scottish. The prime minister told the BBC he had the \u201cgreatest respect for the judiciary\u201d. Asked if he would recall Parliament if that\u2019s what the supreme court said he ought to do, Johnson said: \u201cI think the best thing I could do is wait and see what the judges say.\u201d A Northern Ireland prorogation claim, argued on behalf of Raymond McCord, a victims\u2019 rights campaigner whose son was murdered by loyalist paramilitaries, will be heard on Thursday. There was a further hearing in Belfast on Monday of appeals from other Northern Ireland cases involving claims that a no-deal Brexit and the imposition of a hard border would damage the Northern Ireland peace process. Judgment was reserved. Those involved may apply to the supreme court for a separate hearing later this month if they lose. The main claimant in the English case is the businesswoman and legal campaigner Gina Miller. She brought the first article 50 challenge in 2016 that resulted in victory when parliament, not the government, was confirmed to have the right to authorise the UK\u2019s departure. Her latest action is consequently known in legal circles as Miller (No 2). She will be represented again by Lord Pannick QC, one of the leading constitutional lawyers of his generation. He will open submissions on Tuesday morning and be followed in the afternoon by Lord Keen. Both are applicants seeking to overturn judgments in London and in Edinburgh respectively. Eadie, Pannick and Keen are all, coincidentally, in the same London chambers, Blackstone Chambers, which specialises in constitutional cases. The Scottish legal team will be led by Aidan O\u2019Neill QC, acting for a cross-party group of 75 MPs and peers including the SNP MP Joanna Cherry QC. Their action has been funded by Jolyon Maugham QC\u2019s Good Law Project. Other politicians, MPs, human rights groups and individuals have applied to intervene in the three-day hearing. Those allowed to intervene will present their claims on Thursday afternoon. Many campaigners were disappointed to be excluded from the London high court hearing earlier this month, including a barrister, Roger Harrison, who told the Guardian he had to pay a court fee of \u00a3255 even though he was denied permission. It is not clear whether there will be legal skirmishes over disclosure. Michael Gove, chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, has refused to comply with MPs\u2019 requests for messages relating to the suspension of parliament sent by Johnson\u2019s senior adviser, Dominic Cummings and various other aides. Gove said it would be \u201csingularly unfair to the named individuals\u201d. Dominic Grieve QC, the former attorney general, told MPs last week he had information from public officials that the correspondence contained a \u201cscandal\u201d. The supreme court justices who will hear the case are: Lady Hale, president; Lord Reed, deputy president; Lord Kerr; Lord Wilson; Lord Carnwath; Lord Hodge; Lady Black; Lord Lloyd-Jones; Lady Arden; Lord Kitchin; and Lord Sales. Permission has been given for six interveners in the Gina Miller case. They are: the lord advocate for the Scottish government, Raymond McCord, the counsel general for Wales, Sir John Major, Baroness Chakrabarti, the shadow attorney general, and the Public Law Project.",

Pankaj Mishra was indeed justified in observing that we live in an \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/dec/08/welcome-age-anger-brexit-trump\">age of anger</a>\u201d. </p> <p>Among the angriest are small groups of young white Norwegian men seemingly unable to cope with their perception of a loss of privilege to women and immigrants. But the background mood music of hatred against Muslims in Norway goes far wider than that. According to surveys, 34% of Norwegians have strongly negative attitudes towards Muslims; 31% subscribe to a <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09596410.2013.783969\">version of the </a><a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09596410.2013.783969\">\u201cEurabia\u201d theory</a>. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/22/this-is-europe-sign-up-guardian-email-updates\">This is Europe: stay close with the Guardian\u2019s email updates</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yet, Norwegian academics wanting to conduct research on racism in Norway (other than antisemitism) after 2011 have found their calls for funding falling on deaf ears.

In 2017, six years after Breivik, the Norwegian police security services, PST, made the extraordinary claim that Norway had not \u201cbeen struck by \u2026 rightwing extremist terrorism to the same extent as \u2026other European countries\u201d. In its annual threat assessment for 2019, the PST declared that a rightwing extremist terrorist attack in Norway in 2019 was \u201cvery unlikely\u201d. This had to be hastily updated following the mosque shooting with a PST warning that a rightwing extremist terror attack \u201cin the coming year\u201d is indeed a possibility. The hate against Muslims that motivated both Breivik and Manshaus is to a large extent generated in the online and international netherworld of rightwing extremism and white supremacy. Pankaj Mishra was indeed justified in observing that we live in an \u201cage of anger\u201d. Among the angriest are small groups of young white Norwegian men seemingly unable to cope with their perception of a loss of privilege to women and immigrants. But the background mood music of hatred against Muslims in Norway goes far wider than that. According to surveys, 34% of Norwegians have strongly negative attitudes towards Muslims; 31% subscribe to a version of the \u201cEurabia\u201d theory. Yet, Norwegian academics wanting to conduct research on racism in Norway (other than antisemitism) after 2011 have found their calls for funding falling on deaf ears. The government has initiated two action plans against antisemitism since 2013, but has so far been adamantly opposed to similar measures to combat Islamophobia. Norway\u2019s first ever research project on Islamophobia obtained funding only in 2018. Regional elections on 8 and 9 September were again framed by the Progress party as being about immigration, integration and Muslims. But for the first time since 1987, this backfired, and the rightwing government suffered a severe beating, losing ground to a red, green and centrist rural political wave. In an interview after the B\u00e6rum mosque shooting, the mosque\u2019s Irfan Mushtaq pleaded for \u201ca government that stands up to hatred against Muslims, and does so in actions and not only words\u201d. After appeasing and instrumentalising hatred for years, perhaps the Norwegian government is finally getting this message from the voters. \u2022 Sindre Bangstad is a social anthropologist and the author of Anders Breivik and the Rise of Islamophobia",

      "bodyText": "To appreciate just how different from the norm the 2019 Rugby World Cup is going to be, one has only to set foot outside. Even on a damp Monday in Tokyo, the humidity is unmissable and so is the air of novelty. Judging by the 15,000 locals who queued around the block just to watch Wales train in Kitakyushu, the next few weeks are going to challenge plenty of familiar assumptions Drive \u2013 or rather crawl \u2013 through the busier business districts of the Japanese capital and images of the host nation\u2019s players are plastered across the windows of 24-7 convenience stores. There is even a 40ft high action picture of the Australia fly-half Bernard Foley, not normally a household name, on a tower block overlooking one of the main intersections. The All Blacks long-serving coach, Steve Hansen, has traversed the rugby world multiple times but even he looks faintly taken aback by the rising tide of craziness. With Friday\u2019s kick-off approaching, England\u2019s trump card is also becoming increasingly apparent. Having coached extensively in Japan, few individuals have a clearer idea of what awaits than Eddie Jones, who also guided the Brave Blossoms to three pool wins at the 2015 World Cup. Jones has hung around professional sport long enough to know nothing will be easy but his insider knowledge could yet prove invaluable. With the weather forecast for the region unsettled for the next fortnight, this already has the feel of a tournament which could upset even the most carefully laid plans. If it pours down for New Zealand\u2019s game against South Africa in Yokohama this Saturday, for example, one involuntary slip of a greasy ball could reshape the entire competition. When Warren Gatland is rubbing baby oil on Wales\u2019s training balls on the eve of a World Cup and the lead singer of a Japanese death metal band is among the host nation\u2019s interpreters, anything is possible once the actual rugby starts. In that respect the next few weeks will be right up Jones\u2019s street. Never mind that England\u2019s opening game against Tonga will be safely staged beneath a closed roof in Sapporo in the more northerly climes of Hokkaido.

Looking back at his unfolding masterplan with the benefit of hindsight, however, is instructive. When it comes to removing players from their comfort zones, Jones has been relentlessly consistent. All the comings and goings in selection, the ridiculously early alarm calls and the excessive backroom staff turnover now feel part of that same grand design. Love him or not, his players can now sense things starting to take real shape. When England bolt all the various key segments of their gameplan together \u2013 fitness, defence, a strong set-piece, pace out wide \u2013 as they did against Ireland in both February and August they can look devastating. Maybe, too, Jones\u2019s luck is changing.

Without it, 18 plays including Macbeth and The Tempest might have been lost to history. Around 750 first folios were printed, with 233 known to survive. They command huge sums at auction, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/may/25/shakespeares-first-four-folios-sell-at-auction-for-almost-25m\">one selling for \u00a31.87m three years ago</a>.</p> <p>Scott-Warren has made a detailed comparison of the annotator\u2019s handwriting with the Paradise Lost poet\u2019s. He also believes that the work the annotator did to improve the text of the folio \u2013 suggesting corrections and supplying additional material such as the prologue to Romeo and Juliet, along with cross-references to other works \u2013 is similar to work Milton did in other books that survive from his library, including his copy of Boccaccio\u2019s Life of Dante.</p> <p>The scholar tentatively suggested <a href=\"https://www.english.cam.ac.uk/cmt/?p=5751\">in a blogpost</a> that he might have identified John Milton\u2019s copy of the Shakespeare First Folio of 1623, admitting that, \u201cin this as in other cases, there\u2019s usually a lot of wishful thinking, plus copious spinning of the evidence to make it seem plausible, and elision of anything that doesn\u2019t seem to fit\u201d.</p> <p>But he soon found that other scholars were agreeing with him. \u201cNot only does this hand look like Milton\u2019s, but it behaves like Milton\u2019s writing elsewhere does, doing exactly the things Milton does when he annotates books, and using exactly the same marks,\u201d said Dr Will Poole at New College Oxford. \u201cShakespeare is our most famous writer, and the poet John Milton was his most famous younger contemporary. It was, until a few days ago, simply too much to hope that Milton\u2019s own copy of Shakespeare might have survived \u2014 and yet the evidence here so far is persuasive. This may be one of the most important literary discoveries of modern times.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEveryone\u2019s been weighing in, every day someone suggests a new similarity,\u201d Scott-Warren said. \u201cI feel 100% sure, but there are still people out there who remain to be convinced. I guess there is a question of if other people could have very similar handwriting.\u201d</p> <p>As well as numerous textual annotations, the folio also contains a host of line markings, showing the annotator\u2019s engagement with, particularly, Hamlet, Romeo and Juliet, Macbeth, The Tempest, Henry IV, As You Like It and King Lear. Scott-Warren believes these can be traced to Milton\u2019s own work.</p> <p>\u201cThe book is absolutely covered with lines in the margin of passages and when you\u2019re reading those thinking the annotator is Milton they become really interesting,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s how they echo with his work, the sense that the volume offers you the opportunity to read Shakespeare through Milton\u2019s eyes. Because the lines in the margin don\u2019t give you any verbal content, you don\u2019t know why he\u2019s singled out a passage for attention, but it forces you to think your way into Milton\u2019s head and it does really chime with a lot of what goes on in his poetry, so you can see him constructing himself through Shakespeare.\u201d</p> <p>One highlighted section in The Tempest is the song: \u201cCome unto these yellow sands, / And then take hands: / Courtsied when you have and kiss\u2019d / The wild waves whist.\u201d The unusual rhyme, of \u201ckiss\u2019d\u201d and \u201cwhist\u201d, is echoed in <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44735/on-the-morning-of-christs-nativity\">Milton\u2019s On the Morning of Christ\u2019s Nativity</a>: \u201cThe winds with wonder whist, / Smoothly the waters kist.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe would already have known about that allusion, they are the only two writers who used that rhyme, but you can see him marking it in the text and responding to it,\u201d said Scott-Warren. \u201cIt gives you a sense of his sensitivity and alertness to Shakespeare. What\u2019s quite remarkable as well is that he\u2019s singled out for attention lots of the passages that have become incredibly famous \u2013 he goes through and marks out some of the most celebrated Shakespearean speeches.\u201d</p> <p>It has always been known that Shakespeare was a huge influence on Milton \u2013 in his poem <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/46453/on-shakespeare-1630\">On Shakespeare</a>, Milton calls him a \u201cson of Memory\u201d and \u201cgreat heir of fame\u201d, writing of how \u201cThou in our wonder and astonishment / Hast built thyself a live-long monument.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut this allows us to see the encounter happening,\u201d said Scott-Warren. \u201cIt shows you the firsthand encounter between two great writers, which you don\u2019t often get to see, especially in this period. A lot of that kind of evidence is lost, so that\u2019s really exciting.\u201d</p> <p>He is now intending to collaborate with Bourne on a series of articles about the find. \u201cHaving these annotations might allow us to identify further books that have been annotated by Milton,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is evidence of how digital technology and the opening up of libraries [could] transform our knowledge of this period.\u201d</p>",

I guess there is a question of if other people could have very similar handwriting.\u201d As well as numerous textual annotations, the folio also contains a host of line markings, showing the annotator\u2019s engagement with, particularly, Hamlet, Romeo and Juliet, Macbeth, The Tempest, Henry IV, As You Like It and King Lear. Scott-Warren believes these can be traced to Milton\u2019s own work. \u201cThe book is absolutely covered with lines in the margin of passages and when you\u2019re reading those thinking the annotator is Milton they become really interesting,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s how they echo with his work, the sense that the volume offers you the opportunity to read Shakespeare through Milton\u2019s eyes. Because the lines in the margin don\u2019t give you any verbal content, you don\u2019t know why he\u2019s singled out a passage for attention, but it forces you to think your way into Milton\u2019s head and it does really chime with a lot of what goes on in his poetry, so you can see him constructing himself through Shakespeare.\u201d One highlighted section in The Tempest is the song: \u201cCome unto these yellow sands, / And then take hands: / Courtsied when you have and kiss\u2019d / The wild waves whist.\u201d The unusual rhyme, of \u201ckiss\u2019d\u201d and \u201cwhist\u201d, is echoed in Milton\u2019s On the Morning of Christ\u2019s Nativity: \u201cThe winds with wonder whist, / Smoothly the waters kist.\u201d \u201cWe would already have known about that allusion, they are the only two writers who used that rhyme, but you can see him marking it in the text and responding to it,\u201d said Scott-Warren. \u201cIt gives you a sense of his sensitivity and alertness to Shakespeare. What\u2019s quite remarkable as well is that he\u2019s singled out for attention lots of the passages that have become incredibly famous \u2013 he goes through and marks out some of the most celebrated Shakespearean speeches.\u201d It has always been known that Shakespeare was a huge influence on Milton \u2013 in his poem On Shakespeare, Milton calls him a \u201cson of Memory\u201d and \u201cgreat heir of fame\u201d, writing of how \u201cThou in our wonder and astonishment / Hast built thyself a live-long monument.\u201d \u201cBut this allows us to see the encounter happening,\u201d said Scott-Warren. \u201cIt shows you the firsthand encounter between two great writers, which you don\u2019t often get to see, especially in this period. A lot of that kind of evidence is lost, so that\u2019s really exciting.\u201d He is now intending to collaborate with Bourne on a series of articles about the find. \u201cHaving these annotations might allow us to identify further books that have been annotated by Milton,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is evidence of how digital technology and the opening up of libraries [could] transform our knowledge of this period.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Welcome to this week\u2019s blogpost. Here\u2019s our roundup of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2019/sep/09/tips-links-and-suggestions-what-are-you-reading-this-week\">your comments and photos</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2019/sep/02/tips-links-and-suggestions-what-are-you-reading-this-week\"> </a>from last week.</p> <p>Let\u2019s start with a Canadian writer. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/margaretatwood\">No, not that one</a>. <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/11415792\">Brooke Sherbrooke</a> actually recommends Michael Crummey\u2019s The Innocents:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I realise that over the next few months, the most widely read Canadian writer will be our treasure, Margaret Atwood. However, I am reading another writer from Canada - one who writes almost exclusively about the Newfoundland &amp; Labrador coast, with stories of almost mythical intensity. Michael Crummey\u2019s latest is The Innocents. The prose in the first two chapters is lyrical. It has become a bit grittier since then but I am always willing to ride whatever waves roll in, when Mr Crummey is the writer. I loved Sweetland and am thrilled to be reading these maritime lilts again.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/10/share-your-reviews-of-the-testaments-by-margaret-atwood\">We\u2019re also inviting reviews of The Testaments here</a>. (And please also feel free to share them with us below the line here on Tips, Links And Suggestions.)</p> <p>Elsewhere in the world, Svetlana Alexievich\u2019s Second-Hand Time has impressed <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/748720\">JayZed</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u2019s a polyphonic oral history of people\u2019s personal experiences of the Soviet Union, its collapse and the aftermath, based on interviews that Alexievich had conducted over 20 years. I\u2019d been wanting to read something by Alexievich for a while, and now I want to read everything that she\u2019s done. This book was fascinating, moving and often deeply shocking - even though you know at an intellectual level how brutal some of the history is, the individual, personal experiences create a much greater emotional impact. I came out of it feeling that I understood a lot more about what life in the Soviet Union - and in the countries that succeeded it - was actually like. Extremely highly recommended.</p> </blockquote> <p>Chernobyl: History of a Tragedy by Serhii Plokhy has fascinated <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/2599444\">dylan37</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Written with the verve and pace of a Cold War thriller, the terrifying tale of a closed world gone wrong. A misguided test that literally went nuclear, the Soviet rush to denial and cover-up, and the reckless attention to future prevention.</p> <p> The incredible clean-up operation is morbidly detailed, and the huge risks to hundred of thousands of mobilised personnel. The deaths, illness and environmental devastation that followed the disaster are haunting and unforgettable.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/4248884\">Shaybo </a>is \u201cjust finishing\u201d Pat Frank\u2019s 1959 post-nuclear war novel, Alas Babylon:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It feels very current in one sense where the geopolitical causes of war are concerned and, to an extent, \u2018fake news,\u2019 but horribly dated when it comes to its depiction of race and women\u2019s place in society.</p> <p>It\u2019s also a bit of an outlier of the genre, or what it\u2019s become, in that it\u2019s oddly optimistic.</p> </blockquote> <p>Eudora Welty\u2019s The Ponder Heart has entertained <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/4813196\">safereturndoubtful</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>First published in 1954, it is a charming novel about a wealthy Mississippi family; the story of Uncle Daniel Ponder, told by his niece, Edna Earle, who runs the Beulah Hotel in the small town of Clay. Uncle Daniel may have the \u2018sweetest disposition\u2019 in the world, a Southern gentleman of the old school, but he is \u2018simpleminded\u2019 and childish in his actions, so much so that Grandpa Ponder has him put away in an asylum, but Uncle Daniel soon manages to get out. He then ups and marries Miss Teacake Magee, but it doesn\u2019t last long and Grandpa Ponder carries Daniel off to the asylum again, but he is soon out, and marries again. This time it is a seventeen year old girl named Bonnie Dee Peacock from the country\u2026. When Bonnie Dee dies in mysterious circumstances there follows one of the most informal and entertaining trials in fiction, bringing this delightful tale to its fitting climax.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/15798790\">Veufveuve </a>recommends Colson Whitehead\u2019s The Nickel Boys:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think this is a much better novel than The Underground Railroad (which I thought was good, not great). Whitehead is in total command of the story in The Nickel Boys, keeping things taut and tight (am I mixing metaphors or creating redundancy here?). A more intimate canvas allows for richer characterisation. Across about 200 easily-read pages it delivers some real heft and punch.</p> </blockquote> <p>Finally, <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/2791828\">julian6</a>, shares thoughts on Philip Roth\u2019s Everyman:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A spare and stark short novel reviewing the life of a haunted figure - that Roth alter ego that features so prominently in his work. It has some of his most remarkable writing, getting right to the heart of the human plight. The Everyman of the title references not only the famous morality play but also the jewellery store belonging to the central character\u2019s father which is called Everyman\u2019s. We review this lonely commercial artist in his declining years, travel back to his childhood, and see the loss of wives and friends to illness or betrayal or both. It\u2019s a summation of his life - looking at what it meant to him and those closest to him - another Ivan Ilyich with something of Tolstoy\u2019s unflinching gaze. Whatever our sympathies, however his flaws strike us, he and his brother and his colleagues who he contacts as final illnesses strike are most defiantly present and ready for us to experience. You could say we share the humanity of these characters and the book offers as unconditional a solidarity as the character of Knowledge in the original play. \u201cI will go with thee, and be thy guide, In thy most need to go by thy side\u201d.</p> </blockquote> <p>Unconditional solidarity sounds like the kind of thing we need.</p> <h2><strong>Interesting links about books and reading</strong></h2> <ul> <li><p>Jonathan Franzen <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/what-if-we-stopped-pretending\">spoke</a>.

Many of the victims were young children. A further 695 people were injured, many suffering severe burns as flames engulfed the building. No one has ever been investigated or charged for the incident.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/aug/06/counter-terrorism-chief-calls-for-greater-social-inclusion\">Counter-terror chief says policing alone cannot beat extremism</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Lawyers, led by Rodney Dixon QC and Hakan Camuz of the London law firm Stoke White solicitors, have identified four Saudi and Yemeni officials \u2013 both military and governmental \u2013 whom they allege are directly responsible for ordering the bombing even though it was known those attending were civilians.</p> <p>The suspects\u2019 names have been passed to the Met and US justice department which, the lawyers said, can expand their inquiries. All four are known to travel to the UK and US regularly and have therefore not been named.</p> <p>If the police pursue the investigation and the suspects fly into Britain, they could be detained, questioned, charged and imprisoned in the UK. The complaint against the suspects is for alleged crimes of torture under section 134 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988.</p> <p>The 2016 funeral attack involved the use of US-manufactured and supplied weapons. The Saudi-led coalition has already admitted responsibility for the bombing. British military staff and British weapons have been involved in other bombing raids on Houthi rebels in Yemen during the war.</p> <p>The lawyers are also acting for a US citizen, Abdulla al-Alrowashan, who is the brother of Mohammed Ali, and another brother, Khalid Ali Saleh al-Ruwayshan, who is a Yemeni national living in Istanbul.</p> <p>In a statement, Gubari said: \u201cIt is time that the people who murdered Ali and the many other innocent people on that day were made to face some consequences for their actions. They bombed a funeral. There is no excuse that can be given for what they did. We are angry and have suffered helplessly for too long. I really hope that the UK and US police take this seriously and do something about it. Too many innocent people have died for no reason and we deserve justice.\u201d</p> <p>Dixon, of Temple Garden Chambers, said: \u201cAfter reviewing the available evidence it is clear that the crimes committed on 8 October 2016 can and should be investigated under national laws for which universal jurisdiction exists.</p> <p>\u201cThere is cogent evidence that the Saudi officials who planned and carried out the attack on the community hall where the funeral was being held should be investigated for committing war crimes and torture. We need to use all legal avenues that are available to try and bring the families of those innocent people who were killed on that day some semblance of justice.\u201d</p> <p>Camuz said: \u201cThe people of Yemen have suffered for too long with no clear path for them to pursue justice for the many horrific crimes which have been committed against them by the Saudi and UAE coalition forces.</p> <p>\u201cToday\u2019s complaint is the first of its kind in relation to the appalling bombing of the funeral in 2016 and we will do everything we can to assist the Metropolitan police and the Department of Justice as they begin their investigation into these crimes.\u201d</p> <p>Haydee Dijkstal, a barrister at 33 Bedford Row chambers, who is leading on the US complaint, said: \u201cThis was an attack on what was known to be a community centre and could hold up to 1,000 civilians. This is a US citizen who is asking his own government to have the murder of his brother investigated.\u201d</p> <p>A Met police spokesperson said: \u201cWe can confirm that the Met has received a request to carry out an investigation in relation to an incident in Sana\u2019a, Yemen, in October 2016. The request was made by lawyers acting on behalf of a man whose relative is said to have been killed during the incident. The details of the request have been passed to the Met\u2019s war crimes team and is currently being considered by officers.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Metropolitan police and US justice department have been asked to launch a war crimes investigation into Saudi and Yemeni officials over a 2016 air attack that killed 137 civilians attending a family funeral. Under the powers of universal jurisdiction states can undertake inquiries and prosecutions for serious offences such as torture and war crimes even if they were carried out by foreign nationals abroad. A complaint was submitted on Monday to SO15, the Met\u2019s counter-terrorism command by lawyers acting on behalf of a UK national, Nabeel Gubari, 54, whose uncle, Muhammad Ali al-Rowaishan was among those who died in the community centre in Sana\u2019a on 8 October 2016. The bombing was one of the most notorious atrocities of the Yemen war. Many of the victims were young children. A further 695 people were injured, many suffering severe burns as flames engulfed the building. No one has ever been investigated or charged for the incident. Lawyers, led by Rodney Dixon QC and Hakan Camuz of the London law firm Stoke White solicitors, have identified four Saudi and Yemeni officials \u2013 both military and governmental \u2013 whom they allege are directly responsible for ordering the bombing even though it was known those attending were civilians. The suspects\u2019 names have been passed to the Met and US justice department which, the lawyers said, can expand their inquiries. All four are known to travel to the UK and US regularly and have therefore not been named. If the police pursue the investigation and the suspects fly into Britain, they could be detained, questioned, charged and imprisoned in the UK. The complaint against the suspects is for alleged crimes of torture under section 134 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988. The 2016 funeral attack involved the use of US-manufactured and supplied weapons. The Saudi-led coalition has already admitted responsibility for the bombing. British military staff and British weapons have been involved in other bombing raids on Houthi rebels in Yemen during the war. The lawyers are also acting for a US citizen, Abdulla al-Alrowashan, who is the brother of Mohammed Ali, and another brother, Khalid Ali Saleh al-Ruwayshan, who is a Yemeni national living in Istanbul. In a statement, Gubari said: \u201cIt is time that the people who murdered Ali and the many other innocent people on that day were made to face some consequences for their actions. They bombed a funeral. There is no excuse that can be given for what they did. We are angry and have suffered helplessly for too long. I really hope that the UK and US police take this seriously and do something about it. Too many innocent people have died for no reason and we deserve justice.\u201d Dixon, of Temple Garden Chambers, said: \u201cAfter reviewing the available evidence it is clear that the crimes committed on 8 October 2016 can and should be investigated under national laws for which universal jurisdiction exists. \u201cThere is cogent evidence that the Saudi officials who planned and carried out the attack on the community hall where the funeral was being held should be investigated for committing war crimes and torture. We need to use all legal avenues that are available to try and bring the families of those innocent people who were killed on that day some semblance of justice.\u201d Camuz said: \u201cThe people of Yemen have suffered for too long with no clear path for them to pursue justice for the many horrific crimes which have been committed against them by the Saudi and UAE coalition forces. \u201cToday\u2019s complaint is the first of its kind in relation to the appalling bombing of the funeral in 2016 and we will do everything we can to assist the Metropolitan police and the Department of Justice as they begin their investigation into these crimes.\u201d Haydee Dijkstal, a barrister at 33 Bedford Row chambers, who is leading on the US complaint, said: \u201cThis was an attack on what was known to be a community centre and could hold up to 1,000 civilians. This is a US citizen who is asking his own government to have the murder of his brother investigated.\u201d A Met police spokesperson said: \u201cWe can confirm that the Met has received a request to carry out an investigation in relation to an incident in Sana\u2019a, Yemen, in October 2016. The request was made by lawyers acting on behalf of a man whose relative is said to have been killed during the incident. The details of the request have been passed to the Met\u2019s war crimes team and is currently being considered by officers.\u201d",

They need to run with that mood \u2013 or rather crawl with it, and forget about doing everything in a hurry. The only way to win in Australia is to go huge in the first innings, and England need to develop players, especially in the top three, who get high on dot balls. A change to the domestic schedule, so that four-day cricket is played in the middle of the summer on flatter pitches, perhaps with a Kookaburra ball, is essential. When England won in 2010-11, they batted for 150 overs, or five sessions, in four of the seven innings. Under Joe Root\u2019s captaincy they have failed to do so in 62 attempts. Yes, batting has changed \u2013 but not that much. In Australia frisky cameos with the bat win only contempt.</p> \n<h2><strong>2) Pick players on substance rather than style</strong></h2> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/audio/2019/sep/16/the-ashes-after-show-party-the-spin-podcast\">The Ashes after show party \u2013 The Spin podcast</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The player with the highest batting average during Root\u2019s captaincy is Ben Foakes, with 41.50 from five Tests. He was dropped in the West Indies, two games after being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/nov/06/debutant-ben-foakes-unbeaten-87-england-recovery-galle-sri-lanka-first-test-cricket\" title=\"\">player of the series in Sri Lanka</a>. The removal of such a quiet achiever was symbolic of an era in which England have been seduced by potential, style and white-ball form. It evokes the Gerrard-Lampard years of English football, when the national team looked infinitely better on paper than on the pitch. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/14/england-new-zealand-cricket-world-cup-final-match-report-super-over\" title=\"\">England\u2019s ODI swashbucklers </a>bat in such a persuasive style as to brainwash us into thinking they have, or might, score more runs than is actually the case. A change of culture is overdue. It would not be easy to leave out players as obviously talented as Jonny Bairstow or Jos Buttler \u2013 but then it should not have been easy to drop the best wicketkeeper in the country, especially when his batting average was higher than the rest.</p> \n<h2>3) Crack the Steve Smith code</h2> \n<p>There are some strange jobs in the world: pet food taster, armpit sniffer and cricket live blogger are all paid professions. The ECB should add to the list by appointing a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/sep/01/steve-smith-ashes-fourth-test-old-trafford-ben-stokes-joe-root\" title=\"\">Director of Steve Smith Studies</a>. For the next 26 months, the ECB should undertake the kind of analysis of a single sportsman that has never been done before. They need the kind of Eureka moment that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2013/jul/04/20-great-ashes-moments-donald-bradman\" title=\"\">Douglas Jardine had when he came up with Bodyline</a> as an antidote to the industrial run-scoring of Don Bradman. To achieve that they should study footage and data, think outside boxes, leave no theory unexplored and pick brains around the world from Wasim Akram to Nasser Hussain to Ian Chappell. If Smith averages over 100 for the third consecutive Ashes, England will have 0% chance of regaining them.</p> \n<h2>4) Start planning now</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"65a38d3322d0a2c4aa21f90da8d1c673042b9abc\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/65a38d3322d0a2c4aa21f90da8d1c673042b9abc/0_365_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"If England are serious about burnout they will need to leave Jofra Archer out of some Tests against India\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">If England are serious about burnout they will need to leave Jofra Archer out of some Tests against India.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The two triumphant Ashes tours of the modern era, 2010-11 and 2019, had one thing in common \u2013 the kind of planning usually reserved for a military operation. Root says preparations for 2021-22 start now \u2013 but England said exactly the same after the last tour of Australia, and nothing much has changed.

      "bodyText": "1) Revive the lost art of batting time In the second half of the Ashes series England\u2019s batsmen hinted at a move away from \u201cit\u2019s the way we play\u201d. They need to run with that mood \u2013 or rather crawl with it, and forget about doing everything in a hurry. The only way to win in Australia is to go huge in the first innings, and England need to develop players, especially in the top three, who get high on dot balls. A change to the domestic schedule, so that four-day cricket is played in the middle of the summer on flatter pitches, perhaps with a Kookaburra ball, is essential. When England won in 2010-11, they batted for 150 overs, or five sessions, in four of the seven innings. Under Joe Root\u2019s captaincy they have failed to do so in 62 attempts. Yes, batting has changed \u2013 but not that much. In Australia frisky cameos with the bat win only contempt. 2) Pick players on substance rather than style The player with the highest batting average during Root\u2019s captaincy is Ben Foakes, with 41.50 from five Tests. He was dropped in the West Indies, two games after being player of the series in Sri Lanka. The removal of such a quiet achiever was symbolic of an era in which England have been seduced by potential, style and white-ball form. It evokes the Gerrard-Lampard years of English football, when the national team looked infinitely better on paper than on the pitch. England\u2019s ODI swashbucklers bat in such a persuasive style as to brainwash us into thinking they have, or might, score more runs than is actually the case. A change of culture is overdue. It would not be easy to leave out players as obviously talented as Jonny Bairstow or Jos Buttler \u2013 but then it should not have been easy to drop the best wicketkeeper in the country, especially when his batting average was higher than the rest. 3) Crack the Steve Smith code There are some strange jobs in the world: pet food taster, armpit sniffer and cricket live blogger are all paid professions. The ECB should add to the list by appointing a Director of Steve Smith Studies. For the next 26 months, the ECB should undertake the kind of analysis of a single sportsman that has never been done before. They need the kind of Eureka moment that Douglas Jardine had when he came up with Bodyline as an antidote to the industrial run-scoring of Don Bradman. To achieve that they should study footage and data, think outside boxes, leave no theory unexplored and pick brains around the world from Wasim Akram to Nasser Hussain to Ian Chappell. If Smith averages over 100 for the third consecutive Ashes, England will have 0% chance of regaining them. 4) Start planning now The two triumphant Ashes tours of the modern era, 2010-11 and 2019, had one thing in common \u2013 the kind of planning usually reserved for a military operation. Root says preparations for 2021-22 start now \u2013 but England said exactly the same after the last tour of Australia, and nothing much has changed. A decent first step would be to consult Andrew Strauss and Andy Flower about the marginal gains \u2013 not so much 1 percenters as 0.01 percenters \u2013 they achieved before and during the 2010-11 series. English cricket also needs to do more than pay lip-service to the avoidance of burnout. In particular, they need to manage, on a micro and macro level, the workload of Jofra Archer, the kind of fast bowler England have craved on Ashes tours since John Snow wreaked havoc in 1970-71. Calculated sacrifices will have to be made. England are scheduled to play 10 Tests against India in the nine months before the next Ashes tour. Huge games, all. But if they are really serious about winning the Ashes, Archer needs to miss some of them. 5) Change the captain It would be delightful to wolf down humble pie as Root lifts the urn in January 2022 but all on-field evidence suggests he is never going to learn the art of captaincy. The main argument for retaining him seems to be that there is nobody else. That is not strictly true and ignores the fact that other captains would not come with such great opportunity cost \u2013 Root averages 53 in Tests when he is not in charge, compared to 41 as captain, and 34 since the end of the 2017-18 Ashes. England have sacrificed their only great batsman for a mediocre captain; the trade is unlikely to get much better. When Root was England\u2019s player of the series in the 2015 Ashes, captaincy was a thing of the future and he had the most infectious smile in world cricket. It would be lovely to see it again.",

      "bodyText": "The Saudi oil attacks have triggered the steepest crude market price surge in 30 years and stoked fears for the global economy. The attacks on Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil infrastructure led to the biggest jump in global prices since 1988 by wiping out 5.7m barrels of production a day \u2013 5% of the world\u2019s oil supply. The price of Brent crude surged by more than $12 (\u00a39.60) a barrel within seconds as trading began in London, quickly climbing to highs of $70.88 \u2013 a rise of more than 19% \u2013 before settling lower in a day of record-breaking oil trading. By Monday evening oil was trading at nearly $69, up 15% on the day. Oil futures trading reached a new all-time record on the Intercontinental Exchange as traders placed more than 2m bets on the future price of oil as a hedge against more market volatility. Meanwhile, the energy price shock reverberated through global markets, driving up shares in energy companies on the prospect of higher profits, while stock exchanges across Europe plunged into the red as investors took fright over rising geopolitical tensions. Oil market analysts claim prices could surge towards $100 a barrel in the coming weeks if Middle East tensions lead to renewed disruption in the strait of Hormuz, a key transit route for the world\u2019s oil tankers. Geoffrey Smith, a director at the market data firm Refinitiv, said Saudi Arabia has \u201cresumed loading oil from its storage reserves to make up for the break over the weekend \u2013 but in the longer terms its exports are in doubt. \u201cThe question is how long Saudi Arabia can maintain export levels and quality while the damage is fixed. The most likely effects are to be felt from November onwards as storage might start hitting critical levels if the processing facility has not been repaired,\u201d Smith said. A Middle East energy crisis could be a boon for the US fracking industry, but threatens to tip the stumbling global economy into a recession by stemming supply to Asian economies. Rising oil prices also threaten consumer spending \u2013 a key growth factor for economies \u2013 because they could force up prices and depress demand for goods. Donald Trump said the US was \u201clocked and loaded\u201d to retaliate and could authorise the release of US oil reserves to help balance the market. But energy experts cast doubt on whether US fracking companies \u2013 who produce oil by breaking up shale rock formations underground - would be able to fill the gap left by Saudi oil production plants. Bj\u00f8rnar Tonhaugen, the head of oil markets at the research firm Rystad Energy, said the world was \u201cnot even close\u201d to being able to replace Saudi exports. \u201cThe market\u2019s reaction to Saudi Arabia\u2019s importance, in the new era of US shale, will now be put to the test,\u201d he said. The global economy has been faltering against a backdrop of rising trade tensions between the US and China. Demand for oil had been falling in recent months as industrial production slowed while the world\u2019s two biggest economies imposed punitive tariffs on one another\u2019s goods. Economists said higher oil prices could compound the pressure on manufacturing output, which had already plunged into recession territory as a result of the trade war, serving as a further brake on global growth. Philip Shaw, the chief economist at the City bank Investec, said: \u201cAgainst a background where you have global trade on a downward trajectory because of the tariff war between the US and China, it\u2019s not helping at all.\u201d The spike after the Saudi attacks returned the oil price to levels last seen in July, which analysts said could mitigate some of the impact on global growth. However, Shaw said growth around the world could slip below 3% this year, marking the weakest expansion since the depths of the global financial crisis in 2009. Some energy experts believe the global oil price shock may even help efforts to shift economies from fossil fuels to green energy alternatives. Artur Baluszynski, the head of research at investment firm Henderson Rowe, said Europe may \u201cfeel the pain of higher energy prices\u201d in the short term, \u201cbut in the long term, more expensive fossil fuels will accelerate Europe\u2019s already leading position in renewables like wind and solar\u201d. Callum Macpherson, the head of commodities at Investec, said: \u201cOnly time will tell, but we may look back on this incident as a critical development in motivating the energy transition.\u201d A spokesman for the RAC, Simon Williams, said the steep market price hike for petrol and diesel will not necessarily hit drivers at the pumps unless oil prices are allowed to remain high in the long-term. \u201cThe wholesale prices of both petrol and diesel look set to increase by 3p a litre, [but] this doesn\u2019t necessarily mean higher prices at the pumps because retailers only just began to pass on overdue wholesale price savings at the end of last week,\u201d Williams said.

      "bodyText": "Growth in China\u2019s industrial production slumped last month to its weakest rate in more than 17 years as US import tariffs and softening domestic demand took their toll on factory owners. Measures of retail sales and investment also reinforced concerns that the world\u2019s second largest economy would need to make further cuts to interest rates to boost growth after moves last week by its central bank to ease lending restrictions were criticised by some analysts as \u201ctoo little, too late\u201d. Industrial output growth slowed to 4.4% in August compared with the same month a year earlier, down from 4.8% in July, to register the slowest pace of expansion since February 2002. Premier Li Keqiang is understood to be concerned that a strategy of bringing down carbon emissions to meet climate targets is hurting factory output just as domestic and global demand is slowing. The situation has worsened in the last year as Donald Trump expanded the number of goods caught by US import tariffs on Chinese products Chinese companies have responded by cutting production and repatriating investments in the US, while seeking outlets in other markets for their goods. \u201cThe whole manufacturing sector is affected by the trade war. Production and sales of vehicles and home appliances have been plunging,\u201d said Richard Lu, an analyst with CRU in Beijing. He said steel firms had also underperformed due to rising raw material costs. Li said it was very difficult for the economy to grow at 6% or more and that it faced downward pressure. Retail sales missed expectations, with growth easing to 7.5%, from 7.6% in July. Car sales continued a year-long slide, dragging down the overall sales figures. Capital investment was another weak spot, dropping to 5.5% growth over the first eight months of the year from the same period in 2018, down from the 5.7% of the period between January and July. Analysts Wei Yao and Michelle Lam at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale said the lowering of the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) by the central bank \u2013 the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBoC) \u2013 allowed banks to lower their reserves, freeing up more funds for lending. But the move is likely to be followed by more straightforward interest rate cuts. \u201cGiven the latest data, the rate cut last week now just seems a case of \u2018too little, too late\u2019,\u201d they said. \u201cBefore the data came out we thought that one interest rate cut and one RRR cut in one month might be seen as too desperate. But now, we think that even a [small] rate cut tomorrow could look timid. A clear signal that the PBoC wants lower interest rates is all but necessary now,\u201d they added. Several analysts said in recent weeks that China\u2019s economic growth was already testing the lower end of Beijing\u2019s full-year target of about 6%-6.5%, which is likely to spur more policy easing. Second-quarter growth cooled to 6.2%, the weakest in nearly 30 years. Louis Kuijs, head of Asia economics at Oxford Economics, said: \u201cThe key downside risk is the authorities not stepping up policy support sufficiently.\u201d There is the prospect that Beijing will be forced to increase spending to supplement cuts in interest rates after figures showed that China\u2019s monthly crude steel output appeared to artificially boost overall production in August. Steel mills boosted output ahead of production cuts expected to kick in by October as part of Beijing\u2019s anti-pollution drive. Total crude steel production was 87.25m tonnes last month, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed, up 2.4% from 85.22m tonnes in July and up 9.3% from a year earlier.",

      "bodyText": "Detectives in Sicily have arrested three men who allegedly raped and tortured dozens of migrants in a detention centre in the north-west of Libya. Prosecutors in Agrigento have collected testimonies from numerous asylum seekers from north Africa who allegedly recognised their former captors at a migrant registration centre in Messina, Sicily. The three alleged captors, a 27-year-old Guinean man and two Egyptians aged 24 and 26, are accused of torture, kidnapping and human trafficking. \u201cAll the women who were with us, once housed inside the shed, were systematically and repeatedly raped,\u201d reads the testimony of a migrant contained in the investigation documents seen by the Guardian. \u201cWe were locked up and they gave us hard bread and seawater to drink.\u201d The victims, held in Libya from July 2018, also reported that the torturers kept them in the detention centre until their relatives paid for their release. If they had no money, they were sold as slaves or killed. \u201cThey gave us a phone to contact our relatives so we could instruct them how to pay for our release,\u201d another migrant told magistrates. \u201cDuring my imprisonment I saw two migrants shot dead because they tried to escape.\u201d According to the testimonies, the three men operated in the notorious Zawiya detention centre, a former military base in north-west Libya, about 28 miles (45km) west of Tripoli. According to witnesses, the detention centre included an abandoned UN container where migrants were kept prisoners. The head of the detention centre was a powerful Libyan man named Ossama, according to the victims. Short, balding with grey hair, Ossama, described as a migrant-smuggling kingpin, has allegedly been seen whipping migrants using electric cables. \u201cHe always carries two guns with him and, together with his affiliates, gang-raped numerous women,\u201d said the migrants. According to prosecutors, the investigation shines a light on the conditions endured by migrants currently held in Libya or being deported back by the Libyan coastguard. \u201cThis investigation confirms the inhumane living conditions within the so-called Libyan detention centres, and the need to act at international level for the protection of human rights and for the repression of these crimes against humanity,\u201d the chief prosecutor of Agrigento, Luigi Patronaggio, wrote in a press release. For more than two years, the Libyan coastguard, supported by Italy, has been patrolling the waters and stopping boats from leaving Libyan shores for Europe. Under the terms of the deal Italy agreed to train, equip and finance the coastguard. The migrants intercepted by the Libyan coastguard are returned to so-called detention centres where, according to aid groups and the testimonies of asylum seekers, they suffer unspeakable violence, rape and torture. Last week, the UN support mission in Libya released a report suggesting that rescued migrants deported back to Libya were later sold to smugglers by the Libyan police. \u201cSerious concerns continue with regard to the transfer of migrants rescued or intercepted at sea by the Libyan coastguard to unofficial detention centres in Khums,\u201d reads the report, seen by the Guardian. \u201cHundreds of rescued migrants who were reported to have been sent to detention centres were later listed as missing, and it is believed they may have been trafficked or sold to smugglers, while others have disappeared.\u201d Meanwhile, two high-ranking officials of the Italian Navy and Coast Guard will be tried on charges of manslaughter and negligence for a shipwreck occurred on 12 October 2013 in which 268 people died, including 60 children, mostly from Syria.

London is the capital and as it happens I'm conducting the London Symphony Orchestra, who desperately need a hall where they can grow and develop and where we can build a kind of beacon for music all over the country. <br>What we are trying to build here is not simply a concert hall, although of course that is part of it, but to intensify and increase all the magnificent work that is going on in music education and to make a place that will be a magnet for people of all ages to learn about music and to be infected by this hopefully incurable virus. An orchestra's life int he 21st century is not simply a matter of playing great concerts. This is apart of it but everything we do is inform by the work around it and the necessity to be evangelists for the cause. Yesterday I met for the first time the young students at the East London academy, which is one of our new initiatives and an important way to keep young people moving forward, kids who come from the kind of backgrounds that would not normally support their music making.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d7f851a8f0834740f3bc233\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-16T12:51:31.110Z\">1.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/1598341\">TheBigBadWolf</a> asks:</p> <p><em>Where do you stand on applauding between symphony movements?

Brahms was thrilled when at the first performance of his second symphony the third movement had to be played three times before the audience would allow the finale to be played. We've got a bit far away from that now! Although an experience from this summer in Edinburgh with the LSO will remain with me forever: at the close of the First movement of John Adams' Harmonielehre - which ends like a rocket - a woman in the audience went \"WOW\" and everyone was silent for a moment and then laughed and then applauded. We all loved this and felt that that music is wow but we don't normally have the guts to be spontaneous - as you would in a jazz concert. And it's a shame. <br>On the other hand, sometimes an intensity of silence is the best reward.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d7f841a8f08f9df5bdd5502\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-16T12:47:56.453Z\">1.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">It's best to try to be yourself even if you're not that impressed with yourself</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/1704635\">sceptic100</a> asks:</p> <p><em>My question is about listening to recordings.

I must say apart from the sheer quick getting to know of a piece from other people's recordings, the most useful time to listen is just after i've done a series of performances. Because then you know how you have packed your own suitcase. I'll never forget driving in a car after a week of performances of Elgar's second symphony and listening to a recording of Sir Adrian Boult on what was then a Walkman and thinking What a wise old owl was that! But i wondered if i would have completely understood how masterly he was if I hadn't had to deal with the problems first. But there's no doubt that if you try to imitate other conductors either physically or musically you end up simply with a version of the mannerisms and at the end of it all it's best to try to be yourself even if you're not that impressed with yourself.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-16T12:57:52.106Z\">at 1.57pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d7f83bd8f0834740f3bc20d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-16T12:45:54.776Z\">1.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16800392\">PeterMFKaan </a> asks:</p> <p><em>Many years ago I saw the great jazz saxophonist James Moody perform at the Ronnie Scott\u2019s Birmingham venue.

It is the difference between having a great violin and a mediocre one, for instance. Music goes out into space and therefore the room in which it is contained is the very essence of what we do and it changes absolutely everything about how you play and perform. Sometimes halls seem to have their own personality that pushes you in unexpected ways and a hall in which th audience can feel involved and enveloped is the absolute ideal. IN these moments you feel no distance between performer, music and audience. It sounds pretentiously mystical but for us it's a fact on the ground.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d7f825f8f08f9df5bdd54e6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-16T12:40:05.660Z\">1.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/100004560\">JohnPJohn</a> asks:</p> <p><em>Which composers, working and writing now, would you seek out and support?

      "bodyText": "Tzctguar asks: Which female conductors do you admire the most? Hoogensteen asks: I played in an orchestra that recorded lots of Haydn and really enjoyed the work. How have you felt about conducting Haydn? squirrelhead asks: Why does London deserve yet another concert hall instead of some part of the UK which lacks such a venue? TheBigBadWolf asks: Where do you stand on applauding between symphony movements? Are there any particular audience annoyances you have? sceptic100 asks: My question is about listening to recordings. Do you as a conductor (seeking to communicate your own vision of a piece) find it useful to hear recordings of the classics from other great conductors? If so, do you worry about being over-influenced? Does the answer differ for newer/less familiar pieces? When you listen to other conductors\u2019 recordings, do you enjoy them and are you moved by them, or have you reached the point where, for example, only your own Brahms 4 will feel \u201cright\u201d? PeterMFKaan asks: Many years ago I saw the great jazz saxophonist James Moody perform at the Ronnie Scott\u2019s Birmingham venue. Were you there too? It looked like you were sitting next to me, but I couldn\u2019t be sure and I\u2019ve always wondered ... hardatwork asks: Does the baton go in the hold or cabin luggage? ABearWhoHums asks: Does the concert hall design and space ever influence your style of conducting? JohnPJohn asks: Which composers, working and writing now, would you seek out and support? Is there a recent work you would consider \u2018up there\u2019 with the great pieces? GorseBush asks: How rare is it for a musician to start professional life as a conductor? Most I can think of were instrumentalists for years before building a conducting career. But I can remember my brother as a child being regularly conducted by you (as a student, I imagine) so it seems that you were a conductor from the off? fairisfoul asks: I am 38. I did not go to music college (hand injury at 14 meant serious piano playing done at that point; got very down about it, did English degree instead). Needing to earn a living, I am a tax lawyer by day (and yes, that\u2019s nearly as exciting as it sounds!). I have, however, done a whole lot of conducting. That includes: Mahler 2, Mahler 8, the Rite, complete Beethoven and Brahms, most of Sibelius, 15 premieres by local composers, goodness knows what else. I\u2019ve given around 80 concerts over the last 15 years and, for all of those, I\u2019ve been responsible for finding the money and the players, and doing the large majority of the organising. I can give you references from some two very serious soloists with whom I\u2019ve worked a lot, one of whom has played in Berlin with you at the Waldbuhne; and one very serious conductor (for whom you yourself played at the Philharmonie, albeit briefly...). On the strength of the Mahler 2 (earlier this year) I have, to my utter astonishment, been offered my first professional concert - with the LPO, no less (in 2021, date TBC). I gather that this is, to say the least, quite the achievement for someone who isn\u2019t already a full-time musician. It is absolutely my intention to do this for a living, full time. However: I have not the foggiest idea how to make that jump from regular amateur work to regular professional work. No agents will even meet me for a cuppa to discuss it, never mind actually come to a concert. \u201cOh\u201d, they said. \u201cYou\u2019re a bit of a late starter\u201d. As if I hadn\u2019t been doing it for years already. Please could I ask you to make a few concrete suggestions (or even one would do)? I\u2019m pretty sure that there isn\u2019t much else I can physically do with amateur players, but having thought about how to make that next step about - ooh - once every thirty seconds for the last 15 years, I\u2019m no closer to working out the answer. Let\u2019s be clear: I am not young, I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m not (even in my own household...) among \u201cthe most exciting XYZs of my generation\u201d; but I do have a repertoire as long as your arm, years of experience of dealing with people and a knack for and love of conducting. I\u2019d be very grateful if you could share any ideas for how competent non-child non-prodigies might turn that into a career that\u2019s a whole lot more fulfilling than the current desk job. Dodesy asks: As a fan of Liverpool FC, how did you celebrate the team\u2019s Champion\u2019s League victory? And what do you think are the secret of manager J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s leadership skills? LesleyDennis asks: Which conductor has had the most influence on you and what do you think of the music app Nkoda? I think it\u2019s an absolute revelation, and I saw that you have supported it. chris1729 asks: I once watched an excellent documentary about Beethoven, the title of which I now frustratingly can\u2019t remember. In it, there was a British musicologist who said Beethoven\u2019s 9th symphony wasn\u2019t that great; as he was saying it, he had an expression on his face that said he really believed what he was saying, but that he knew that his (apparently well-grounded) opinion would be met by howls of protest from the mob. This has fascinated and intrigued me ever since. What is your opinion of Beethoven\u2019s 9th Symphony? What are its flaws, and, if you don\u2019t believe it has any, what flaws do you think other musicologists might identify? While I\u2019m on - I\u2019m absolutely certain there shouldn\u2019t be a rall at the end of Shostakovich\u2019s 5th Symphony: what do you think? Come on, Sir Simon: don\u2019t let me down, or I shall have to ask Sir Mark. Callum Smith asks: I enjoyed your recent Proms performance of Charles Koechlin\u2019s \u2018Les Bandar-log\u2019. Any plans to perform more of Koechlin\u2019s very underrated but significantly under-recorded work, particularly his groundbreaking Second Symphony? Liverpool-born conductor Sir Simon Rattle begins his third season as music director of the London Symphony Orchestra this week. Under his inspirational leadership, the orchestra has confirmed its place as one of the world\u2019s foremost ensembles, supporting new \u2013 and overlooked \u2013 composers, and bringing bold ideas and fresh insights to better-known works. Rattle has will open his 2019 season with an all-British programme, including a world premiere by young British composer Emily Howard.

In addition, some ambitious plans for a brand new world-class concert hall are becoming a reality, and many of the LSO\u2019s concerts can now be watched free online. But is all rosy? \u201c[Had I known about Brexit at the time] I would have been extraordinarily wary [of taking the job] \u2013 but we will make the best of it we can,\u201d Rattle said, in a 2017 interview. He was one of the signatories on an open letter last year warning the government that Brexit could bring Britain\u2019s cultural industry to its knees. What does he make of things now?

      "body": "<p>It had promised so much, and yet had been such hard going. \u201cIt was,\u201d said Leipzig\u2019s coach, Julian Nagelsmann, \u201clike a run in the forest without much football\u201d for his team. For all the pre-match excitement that they might be facing Bayern Munich at the right time, catching them before they were settled into their season stride, much of this felt ominously familiar for those hoping for a meaningful Bundesliga title race again. The leaders versus the champions looked, for a large chunk of early Saturday evening, like the also-rans against the lords of the manor.</p> \n<p>This was no evening for anybody to dust down their cliches about Bayern-Dusel, though \u2013 the luck of the perennial champions. Any flecks of fortune had been left back at S\u00e4bener Strasse, as was clear from the moment when David Alaba pulled a hamstring in the warm-up, leaving Niko Kovac to an impromptu rejig of his XI. J\u00e9r\u00f4me Boateng came in, with Lucas Hern\u00e1ndez being pushed out to left-back. It proved a significant adjustment.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/16/a-star-is-born-ansu-fati-announces-himself-and-changes-his-world-barcelona-la-liga\">'A star is born': Ansu Fati announces himself and changes his world | Sid Lowe</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Bayern\u2019s record signing was involved in two penalty box scrapes in the first half. Firstly, when VAR helped unpick what would have been an unjustly-awarded penalty to the visitors after Hern\u00e1ndez collided with Marcel Sabitzer. Secondly, and crucially, Hern\u00e1ndez leapt in impetuously on Yussuf Poulsen as time ran out in the first half and with the ball just inside the Bayern penalty box. Emil Forsberg took the kick and converted to give Leipzig a barely believable parity at the break.</p> \n<p>To say it flattered Nagelsmann\u2019s side would be an understatement. Leipzig were not so much on the canvas as clutching on to the ropes with their fingernails in order to preserve their place on the floor. Bayern hit them hard from the off, and led in the third minute. Thomas M\u00fcller\u2019s victory in his physical duel with Lukas Klostermann was the first period in microcosm. Kovac\u2019s men looked sharper, hungrier, and better prepared. After winning possession, M\u00fcller then splendidly played in Robert Lewandowski and he never looked like missing.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/btsportfootball/status/1172912366654230535\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\ud83d\ude2e That didn't take long! <br><br>Bayern on the counterattack and Robert Lewandowski strikes inside the opening three minutes! <a href=\"https://t.co/NEs471VgCH\">pic.twitter.com/NEs471VgCH</a></p>\u2014 Football on BT Sport (@btsportfootball) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/btsportfootball/status/1172912366654230535?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 14, 2019</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>This was the best of Bayern \u2013 notably, with Ivan Perisi\u0107 and Philippe Coutinho on the bench \u2013 with Joshua Kimmich prowling in front of the back four and Kingsley Coman bringing his electric international form back from France and on to the right wing. It felt like their most irresistible moments from last season, and underlined how important Coman and Serge Gnabry are to them in grazing the edges of full throttle post-Arjen Robben and Franck Rib\u00e9ry.</p> \n<p>There was disquiet up in the stands, even with the knowledge that Bayern would be aiming to bring their A game. \u201cJulian is the coach,\u201d Leipzig\u2019s CEO, Oliver Mintzlaff, told Sky after the game. \u201cHe is doing a fantastic job, and he will have had his reasons why he did not switch (the tactics) until half-time.\u201d \u201cBut of course,\u201d he added, \u201cRangnick and I also talked shop,\u201d with reference to last season\u2019s coach, visiting his old club after his summer exit to take on a wider role as Red Bull\u2019s head of sports.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"314aa025c49bfed2311054fc9b7bd5d313d0790a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/314aa025c49bfed2311054fc9b7bd5d313d0790a/604_608_3628_2177/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kingsley Coman turns way from Christopher Nkunku during an electric display by the Frenchman.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kingsley Coman turns way from Christopher Nkunku during a livewire display by the Frenchman.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sebastian Widmann/Bundesliga/Bundesliga Collection via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Such is his assuredness and sense of direction that it\u2019s easy to forget that Nagelsmann is still learning. In eastern Germany, he is learning to steward a title contender, and he received a pointed lesson here. Kevin Kampl, nursing a minor injury that will also keep him out of the Champions League visit to face Benfica, was badly missed in the centre of the park, and the coach had attempted to compensate by switching to three at the back.</p> \n<p>It didn\u2019t fly. When Lewandowski steamed through for the opener, he had the space to have arrived by bus, with extra for Coman in a speedboat at his side. The best young defence in Europe was wide open, and flustered to the degree that even with Bayern feeling confident in their domination, Leipzig had not the sufficient poise to counter on the occasions when they won the ball back. The half-time reshuffle, with Klostermann hooked for Diego Demme, and Nordin Mukiele and Marcel Halstenberg providing some needed ballast at full-back, helped them to maintain the foothold offered by Forsberg\u2019s penalty.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/16/after-552-days-juventus-finally-knocked-off-their-serie-a-perch\">After 552 days, Juventus finally knocked off their Serie A perch | Nicky Bandini</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Peter Gulacsihad been busy and it was testament to Nagelsmann\u2019s switch that there was a twist in the goalkeeping star of the day. Having spent a fair bit of the afternoon as a spectator, Manuel Neuer ended up showing up and then some for his team. He performed a spectacular one-handed save to deny Sabitzer\u2019s wildly swerving shot from range (\u201cI\u2019m used to those from Alaba in training,\u201d he deadpanned afterwards) and then spread himself to deny Timo Werner a late winner.</p> \n<p>To his credit, Nagelsmann knows that he\u2019s still learning, and how far his team has to go. \u201cEven if Bayern has a dent, they have always been the most stable team throughout the season,\u201d he told Kicker. \u201cIf you want to be ahead of them, you need the same stability as them. To reach that point is not easy. We have to develop to get there.\u201d</p> \n<p>Even if this point felt like minor theft \u2013 a sentiment exacerbated by Niklas S\u00fcle lingering on the pitch in disbelief after Gulacsi denied him a late, late winner \u2013 it also represented validation on that quest.

      "bodyText": "It had promised so much, and yet had been such hard going. \u201cIt was,\u201d said Leipzig\u2019s coach, Julian Nagelsmann, \u201clike a run in the forest without much football\u201d for his team. For all the pre-match excitement that they might be facing Bayern Munich at the right time, catching them before they were settled into their season stride, much of this felt ominously familiar for those hoping for a meaningful Bundesliga title race again. The leaders versus the champions looked, for a large chunk of early Saturday evening, like the also-rans against the lords of the manor. This was no evening for anybody to dust down their cliches about Bayern-Dusel, though \u2013 the luck of the perennial champions. Any flecks of fortune had been left back at S\u00e4bener Strasse, as was clear from the moment when David Alaba pulled a hamstring in the warm-up, leaving Niko Kovac to an impromptu rejig of his XI. J\u00e9r\u00f4me Boateng came in, with Lucas Hern\u00e1ndez being pushed out to left-back. It proved a significant adjustment. Bayern\u2019s record signing was involved in two penalty box scrapes in the first half. Firstly, when VAR helped unpick what would have been an unjustly-awarded penalty to the visitors after Hern\u00e1ndez collided with Marcel Sabitzer. Secondly, and crucially, Hern\u00e1ndez leapt in impetuously on Yussuf Poulsen as time ran out in the first half and with the ball just inside the Bayern penalty box. Emil Forsberg took the kick and converted to give Leipzig a barely believable parity at the break. To say it flattered Nagelsmann\u2019s side would be an understatement. Leipzig were not so much on the canvas as clutching on to the ropes with their fingernails in order to preserve their place on the floor. Bayern hit them hard from the off, and led in the third minute. Thomas M\u00fcller\u2019s victory in his physical duel with Lukas Klostermann was the first period in microcosm. Kovac\u2019s men looked sharper, hungrier, and better prepared. After winning possession, M\u00fcller then splendidly played in Robert Lewandowski and he never looked like missing. This was the best of Bayern \u2013 notably, with Ivan Perisi\u0107 and Philippe Coutinho on the bench \u2013 with Joshua Kimmich prowling in front of the back four and Kingsley Coman bringing his electric international form back from France and on to the right wing. It felt like their most irresistible moments from last season, and underlined how important Coman and Serge Gnabry are to them in grazing the edges of full throttle post-Arjen Robben and Franck Rib\u00e9ry. There was disquiet up in the stands, even with the knowledge that Bayern would be aiming to bring their A game. \u201cJulian is the coach,\u201d Leipzig\u2019s CEO, Oliver Mintzlaff, told Sky after the game. \u201cHe is doing a fantastic job, and he will have had his reasons why he did not switch (the tactics) until half-time.\u201d \u201cBut of course,\u201d he added, \u201cRangnick and I also talked shop,\u201d with reference to last season\u2019s coach, visiting his old club after his summer exit to take on a wider role as Red Bull\u2019s head of sports. Such is his assuredness and sense of direction that it\u2019s easy to forget that Nagelsmann is still learning. In eastern Germany, he is learning to steward a title contender, and he received a pointed lesson here. Kevin Kampl, nursing a minor injury that will also keep him out of the Champions League visit to face Benfica, was badly missed in the centre of the park, and the coach had attempted to compensate by switching to three at the back. It didn\u2019t fly. When Lewandowski steamed through for the opener, he had the space to have arrived by bus, with extra for Coman in a speedboat at his side. The best young defence in Europe was wide open, and flustered to the degree that even with Bayern feeling confident in their domination, Leipzig had not the sufficient poise to counter on the occasions when they won the ball back. The half-time reshuffle, with Klostermann hooked for Diego Demme, and Nordin Mukiele and Marcel Halstenberg providing some needed ballast at full-back, helped them to maintain the foothold offered by Forsberg\u2019s penalty. Peter Gulacsihad been busy and it was testament to Nagelsmann\u2019s switch that there was a twist in the goalkeeping star of the day. Having spent a fair bit of the afternoon as a spectator, Manuel Neuer ended up showing up and then some for his team. He performed a spectacular one-handed save to deny Sabitzer\u2019s wildly swerving shot from range (\u201cI\u2019m used to those from Alaba in training,\u201d he deadpanned afterwards) and then spread himself to deny Timo Werner a late winner. To his credit, Nagelsmann knows that he\u2019s still learning, and how far his team has to go. \u201cEven if Bayern has a dent, they have always been the most stable team throughout the season,\u201d he told Kicker. \u201cIf you want to be ahead of them, you need the same stability as them. To reach that point is not easy. We have to develop to get there.\u201d Even if this point felt like minor theft \u2013 a sentiment exacerbated by Niklas S\u00fcle lingering on the pitch in disbelief after Gulacsi denied him a late, late winner \u2013 it also represented validation on that quest. Getting Bayern to bring their best to the party is as sincere as acknowledgement gets. Talking points \u2022 In the other big-four clash of the weekend, Dortmund cleared out the cobwebs of their shock defeat to Union, putting away Leverkusen (and their old coach Peter Bosz) 4-0. It was almost the perfect Lucien Favre performance, authored by diligent defence, with the return of Axel Witsel in front of the back line vital, and lightning counterattacks led by Paco Alc\u00e1cer, skipper Marco Reus and Jadon Sancho. \u201cWe didn\u2019t make any major mistakes,\u201d said the ever-cautious Favre.

This year\u2019s contestant, Michael Rice, came last. \u201cWe very much hope this marks the start of an exciting new chapter,\u201d Balac said. BBC Studios approached several labels, but decided to go with BMG \u2013 which will release and publish the chosen song \u2013 because it shared a \u201cvision of selecting a song with broad international appeal and securing an artist who embodies the spirit and values of the Eurovision song contest\u201d. Kate Phillips, the BBC\u2019s controller of entertainment commissioning, said: \u201cOur commitment to finding the right song has never been higher and this collaboration with BMG, who have access to world-class songwriters, is a genuinely exciting prospect and I am certain that together we can find the best song and artist possible for 2020.\u201d The decision means the live selection show \u2013 which has been in place in its current form since 2016 \u2013 will be scrapped. It is 10 years since the UK finished in the top 10 of the competition. The country has not won Eurovision since 1997, when Katrina and the Waves\u2019 Love Shine a Light was victorious. BMG has a record of launching successful pop careers. The label\u2019s recent releases include Someone You Loved by Lewis Capaldi, Shotgun by George Ezra and I\u2019ll Be There by Jess Glynne. It has also worked with Kylie Minogue and Bring Me the Horizon. Eurovision 2020 will take place in the Dutch city of Rotterdam in May.",

We are working flat out to get one.\u201d</p> <p>Describing Johnson\u2019s meeting on Monday with the European commission president as \u201can important milestone\u201d in the talks, Raab told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that complaints about a lack of detail were \u201cjust part and parcel of the tactical posturing that goes on in any negotiation\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe EU know our position. Lots of the detail has been talked through at both technical and political level, and actually the framework, as I have just described it, is very clear.</p> <p>\u201cOf course, the nature of these negotiations is that there will be a tendency to try and rubbish things we put forward in order to exact further demands. We\u2019re not going to get involved in that.\u201d</p> <p>Raab argued that the EU\u2019s complaints about a lack of detail masked an unwillingness in Brussels to move on its own positions. \u201cWe\u2019ve been clear on all of this in the talks, and we\u2019ll continue to flesh out and be able to respond to any questions.</p> <p>\u201cBut of course at some point the EU is going to have to put up it hands and say: \u2018OK, we know that there\u2019s the requirement for some pragmatism and flexibility to get this deal over the line.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Downing Street\u2019s hopes of a deal centre on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/15/brexit-uk-ministers-talk-up-irish-border-compromise-as-key-to-deal\">finding a technical fix</a> under which Northern Ireland would remain converged with the Republic of Ireland in some sectors, notably food and agriculture, while arrangements for other goods would involve avoiding checkpoints at the border.</p> <p>Raab argued repeatedly that it was up to the EU to shift. \u201cWe want to see some finality to this,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has got to that moment in time, as we lead into the October council, for the decisions to be made. We\u2019re willing and able to do a deal on the grounds I\u2019ve described. The question now is whether the EU has got the political will to meet us to get that deal, which is good for both sides.\u201d</p> <p>On Sunday, an EU source expressed exasperation at what they said was a continued lack of detailed negotiation, saying Johnson seemed more focused on political stunts, such as using a newspaper interview to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/15/hulk-actor-smashes-pms-attempt-at-incredible-metaphor\">compare himself to the Incredible Hulk</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/15/eu-dismay-boris-johnson-compares-himself-to-hulk\">They said</a>: \u201cIt all makes it look like it\u2019s a bit of a joke. We are talking about something extremely serious. The consequences of no deal will be extremely serious and it looks like this is being treated as a game in which you are the hero sort of story rather than [dealing] with real lives.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson will not ask for an extension to the EU transition period beyond December 2020 if he gets a Brexit deal, which would leave just 14 months for arrangements to be put in place to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland. As Johnson sat down for lunch with Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, a No 10 spokesman poured cold water on the idea that the UK might be prepared to accept a longer transition period to help reduce the need for a backstop. \u201cIn the event we were able to secure a deal, there is no intention to extend the implementation period beyond December 2020,\u201d Johnson\u2019s spokesman said. The idea of a longer transition period had been raised by Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, who said on Sunday that Britain could stay in the transition arrangement until the end of 2022 and potentially allow ministers to restore power-sharing in Northern Ireland. Barclay had said: \u201cIt is the case that operationally these issues do not apply until the end of the implementation period, which is December 2020 or one or two years later by mutual agreement.\u201d However, No 10 was adamant this was not the plan and Johnson would stick to the current December 2020 plan for transition if he managed to get a deal at the mid-October EU summit \u2013 just two weeks before the UK is due to leave the bloc. If no deal is struck, Johnson is mandated by a new law to ask for a three-month extension to Britain\u2019s EU membership, but his spokesman would not be drawn on whether he accepted this would happen. Dominic Cummings, the prime minister\u2019s senior adviser, is said to be examining ways for Johnson to avoid that outcome and proceed with a no-deal Brexit on 31 October, possibly involving another prorogation of parliament. \u201cThe PM has said we\u2019re leaving on 31 October. The last meeting of the European council ahead of that deadline is the 17th and 18th \u2026 that is what you\u2019d expect to be the final opportunity to reach an agreement,\u201d the prime minister\u2019s spokesman said. Johnson is still demanding the abolition of the backstop, which could keep the UK indefinitely in a customs union with the EU, and the EU is still insisting that the withdrawal agreement cannot be reopened. At the lunch, Johnson is understood to have sought from Juncker a commitment to talks between the two sides, without concrete proposals for a replacement to the backstop yet being tabled by the UK. Following the meeting with Juncker, a Downing Street spokesman said meetings between the EU and UK would intensify at a political level as well as official level. \u201cThe leaders took stock of the ongoing talks between the UK\u2019s team and [the EU\u2019s] Taskforce 50,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cThe prime minister reconfirmed his commitment to the Good Friday/Belfast agreement and his determination to reach a deal with the backstop removed, that UK parliamentarians could support. The prime minister also reiterated that he would not request an extension and would take the UK out of the EU on 31 October.\u201d Before the meeting, Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, set out an uncompromising UK stance, insisting the EU had been given sufficient details of alternatives to the Irish backstop and must now show \u201cthe political will\u201d to make a deal. He said the EU complaint that it remained in the dark about UK Brexit policy specifics was \u201cpolitical posturing\u201d. It is 26 days since Johnson met Angela Merkel in Berlin, where the German chancellor said the prime minister had 30 days to persuade the EU there was a viable alternative to the backstop. Yet EU sources insist Johnson\u2019s envoy, David Frost, has barely started to touch on concrete proposals. UK government sources indicated concrete written proposals were unlikely to be tabled for at least another week, until after the UN general assembly where Johnson will meet world leaders. Writing for his former employer, the Daily Telegraph, on Monday, Johnson expressed optimism about a deal, but offered no details, saying: \u201cI believe passionately that we can do it, and I believe that such an agreement is in the interests not just of the UK but of our European friends. We are working flat out to get one.\u201d Describing Johnson\u2019s meeting on Monday with the European commission president as \u201can important milestone\u201d in the talks, Raab told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that complaints about a lack of detail were \u201cjust part and parcel of the tactical posturing that goes on in any negotiation\u201d. \u201cThe EU know our position. Lots of the detail has been talked through at both technical and political level, and actually the framework, as I have just described it, is very clear. \u201cOf course, the nature of these negotiations is that there will be a tendency to try and rubbish things we put forward in order to exact further demands. We\u2019re not going to get involved in that.\u201d Raab argued that the EU\u2019s complaints about a lack of detail masked an unwillingness in Brussels to move on its own positions. \u201cWe\u2019ve been clear on all of this in the talks, and we\u2019ll continue to flesh out and be able to respond to any questions. \u201cBut of course at some point the EU is going to have to put up it hands and say: \u2018OK, we know that there\u2019s the requirement for some pragmatism and flexibility to get this deal over the line.\u2019\u201d Downing Street\u2019s hopes of a deal centre on finding a technical fix under which Northern Ireland would remain converged with the Republic of Ireland in some sectors, notably food and agriculture, while arrangements for other goods would involve avoiding checkpoints at the border. Raab argued repeatedly that it was up to the EU to shift. \u201cWe want to see some finality to this,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has got to that moment in time, as we lead into the October council, for the decisions to be made. We\u2019re willing and able to do a deal on the grounds I\u2019ve described. The question now is whether the EU has got the political will to meet us to get that deal, which is good for both sides.\u201d On Sunday, an EU source expressed exasperation at what they said was a continued lack of detailed negotiation, saying Johnson seemed more focused on political stunts, such as using a newspaper interview to compare himself to the Incredible Hulk. They said: \u201cIt all makes it look like it\u2019s a bit of a joke. We are talking about something extremely serious. The consequences of no deal will be extremely serious and it looks like this is being treated as a game in which you are the hero sort of story rather than [dealing] with real lives.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Yemen faces an existential threat, the United Nations special envoy has said, as he prepares to brief the UN security council on the country\u2019s devastating, multi-faceted conflict. The UN meeting comes after disputed claims by Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels that they were behind the drones that caused major devastation at two Saudi oil facilities on Saturday. More than four years of war between the Iran-backed Houthis and a coalition led by Saudi Arabia has brought Yemen to its knees, with accusations of war crimes on all sides. In recent months a secessionist movement in the south has emerged that is taking territory from the Saudi-backed government, further complicating the battlefield situation. The secessionists are backed by the United Arab Emirates (UAE), a partner in the Saudi fight against the Houthis. Griffiths told the BBC that Yemen faced \u201cthe risk of fragmenting and threatening its own existence, which is a massive threat to stability in the region\u201d. \u201cIn these circumstances what we need to do is waste no more time, but to get to the table to get the political agreement in place to end that conflict,\u201d he said. Griffiths\u2019 intervention reflects concerns that the attack on the oil installations could end any Saudi willingness to compromise on a future Houthi stake in Yemen\u2019s government, and that Riyadh will instead revert to an uncompromising search for a military solution that crushes the rebels. If Riyadh believes victory against the Houthis is essential to reduce Iran\u2019s influence across the region, the chances of compromise diminish. Griffiths will call at the UN on Monday for all sides to come together to hold wide-ranging political talks on the country\u2019s future, moving on from the narrow focus on security troop withdrawals in the Red Sea port of Hodeidah, the primary focus of his diplomacy since an outline agreement was reached in Stockholm last December. Diplomats fear Griffiths\u2019s appeal may be ignored if Saudi Arabia joins the US in attributing responsibility for Saturday\u2019s attack to a nexus between the Houthis and Iran. The UAE has recently signalled that it is withdrawing some forces from Yemen, and there had been hope that the Saudis might also wind down their involvement. Griffiths told the BBC he could not personally attribute responsibility for the oil facility attack, or substantiate the Houthis\u2019 claim that they launched the drones. The US government has produced satellite photo that officials have said shows impacts consistent with the attack coming from the direction of Iran or Iraq, rather than from Yemen to the south. For the Houthi claim of responsibility to be true, their armed drones would have had to fly for nearly 620 miles (1,000km) from Houthi-controlled territory in north-west Yemen and across Saudi Arabia to reach their targets in Abqaiq. Few doubt the Houthis\u2019 drone capabilities have grown more sophisticated since February 2017 when they first claimed they were using them for reconnaissance, surveying, assessment and early warning missions. But their basic drones do not have this range. \u201cI really hope the US are right that it did not come from Yemen because it would make it more difficult than even what we are now facing to resolve the conflict,\u201d Griffiths said.",

      "body": "<p>This story starts in a self-proclaimed communist utopia, a tiny village in the Andaluc\u00edan countryside where Che Guevara looks out from the sports ground, Republican flags adorn the town hall and political murals are painted on walls; a small, isolated place with no police where much of the 2,626 population live in identical homes they built themselves and the town\u2019s seal depicts a dove of peace with an olive branch; where they organised raids on supermarkets to feed people, public salaries are equal, collectives work the fields, land confiscated from the aristocracy, and the mayor is fond of Che\u2019s line: only those who dream will someday see their dreams become reality.</p> \n<p>Which is appropriate, even if this reality wasn\u2019t the dream they had. One hundred and one kilometres east of Seville, Marinaleda is, as the title of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/oct/10/village-against-world-dan-hancox-review\">Dan Hancox\u2019s fascinating book</a> calls it, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/20/marinaleda-spanish-communist-village-utopia\">the village against the world</a>. The mayor since 1979 is Juan Manuel S\u00e1nchez Gordillo, who has the kind of beard you\u2019re supposed to have when you\u2019re a founder of the Collective for Workers\u2019 Unity, an instigator of hunger strikes, and the political leader of a place like this \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/15/spanish-robin-hood-sanchez-gordillo\">described as Spain\u2019s Robin Hood</a> \u2013 when you\u2019ve been jailed seven times and the target of at least two assassination attempts.</p> \n<p>One day, or so it goes, S\u00e1nchez Gordillo met Bori, a Guinean who had left Bissau first and Portugal next to come to Spain alone after his wife became pregnant. Bori had nothing, was in a bad way, and had heard Marinaleda was a place where they looked after people. Thrust into the media lately, he says he became S\u00e1nchez Gordillo\u2019s driver (although other versions have him behind the wheel of a rubbish truck) and they became close. The mayor looked after him, gave him work, somewhere to stay, and helped to bring his family over. Bori also worked on the construction of the railway, and turned his hand to anything he could. His wife and two sons joined him and they set up home in Herrera, 10 kilometres away.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a7c0280cd5ffe036621fa9193d6edd07241b0d27\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a7c0280cd5ffe036621fa9193d6edd07241b0d27/0_0_3600_2649/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Juan Manuel S\u00e1nchez Gordillo, pictured in August 2012.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"736\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Juan Manuel S\u00e1nchez Gordillo, pictured in August 2012.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cristina Quicler/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Wearing swimming shorts and in bare feet, aged six, one of his sons went to play football at the local club, where they couldn\u2019t believe what they saw. They knew immediately; some even dashed to the family home to break the news. Unbeknown to Bori, it turned out his son was good at football. Very, <em>very</em> good at football.</p> \n<p>On Saturday night, he scored 111 seconds into his first ever start for Barcelona, standing there arms outstretched in front of 81,617 people.</p> \n<p>He is 16.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/16/after-552-days-juventus-finally-knocked-off-their-serie-a-perch\">After 552 days, Juventus finally knocked off their Serie A perch | Nicky Bandini</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>When Ansu Fati was called up to train with the first team, he didn\u2019t eat and he didn\u2019t sleep, his dad said. Meanwhile, Bori and his wife cried. Ansu had never even played for the B team before. When he ran on at the Camp Nou, there was a look of incredulity in his eyes. At 16 years, 298 days he was the second youngest player ever to play for Barcelona \u2013 Vicen\u00e7 Mart\u00ednez was 18 days younger when he made his debut almost 80 years before \u2013 and he looked it, too: a competition winner whose prize was to play with a professional club. But then he started playing. And then he belonged. \u201cDaring,\u201d Valverde called him.</p> \n<p>But, no, that\u2019s not this week. That was three weeks ago now. That night, Bori announced that he could \u201cdie happy\u201d, but he would have missed so much more. The week after, Ansu came on as a sub at Osasuna. Six minutes later, he scored. At 16 years, 304 days, he was the youngest goalscorer in Barcelona\u2019s history, the third youngest to score a La Liga goal anywhere, ever. And then on Saturday night, 111 seconds into his first Camp Nou start, he scored again, aged 16 years and 318 days.</p> \n<p>They could barely believe this and Ansu had only just begun. This wasn\u2019t one of those things that just happens, a coincidence. It wasn\u2019t something you watch; it was something that takes you with it; something that seemed to take defenders with it too, disoriented and defeated, wondering if it\u2019s real. And the conclusion was that, yes, yes, it is. That <em>he</em> is. Within five minutes, Ansu had left Ezequiel Garay standing like someone had secretly nailed his feet to the floor, stepping past him, and laying it off perfectly for Frenkie de Jong to make it 2-0. No one younger had ever provided an assist and scored, and it still it went on. The next time he got it, there was a nutmeg; feet flashing, he stepped inside and bent the shot <em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/PremierSportsTV/status/1172954110510981122\">this</a></em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/PremierSportsTV/status/1172954110510981122\"> close to the top corner</a>. He\u2019d hardly been playing 10 minutes.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/PremierSportsTV/status/1172950416474218501\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\u26bd What a start for Barca and what a moment for the 16-year-old Ansu Fati!<br><br>\ud83d\udcfa Watch Barcelona v Valencia live on Premier Sports 2! <a href=\"https://t.co/rss3iM0sA3\">pic.twitter.com/rss3iM0sA3</a></p>\u2014 Premier Sports \ud83d\udcfa (@PremierSportsTV) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PremierSportsTV/status/1172950416474218501?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 14, 2019</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>Soon he went tumbling in the area, referee Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda S\u00e1nchez Mart\u00ednez pointing to him and shouting: \u201cAnsu, careful.\u201d Replays suggested that, far from a dive, it might actually have been a penalty, but it didn\u2019t matter. S\u00e1nchez Mart\u00ednez winked indulgently; Ansu smiled and carried on. It was, El Mundo said, \u201cone of those recitals that stirs the soul\u201d. When he controlled on the chest and flicked the ball backwards over the head of Daniel Wass, slipping past to get it again by the six-yard box just before half-time, it was getting silly. So silly that he seemed almost embarrassed to shoot afterwards, like that would be going too far. And yet it wasn\u2019t just silly: every pass was right, every decision too, the supposedly simple things that some find so hard. He was daring, took risks, but still completed almost 80% of his passes, only lost the ball once, and completed every dribble.</p> \n<p>By half-time, Valverde said, his muscles were feeling the strain. And so with an hour gone, and Barcelona 3-1 up, Ansu departed. The Camp Nou stood to hand him an ovation. Waiting on the touchline, applauding too, was Luis Su\u00e1rez, who scored a brilliant first within seconds to make it 4-1 and then added another on the way to a 5-2 victory over a depressed, disintegrating Valencia. Su\u00e1rez is almost twice his age: the day the Uruguayan made his debut, Ansu was two. \u201cAnsu enamours, Su\u00e1rez kills,\u201d ran AS\u2019s headline. \u201cWhat this kid\u2019s doing is something we have to take very seriously; the hour he played was an absolute scandal.\u201d Marca ran on: \u201cThe name\u2019s Fati, Ansu Fati,\u201d opening their match report with the same line El Mundo used for a headline: \u201cA star is born.\u201d El Mundo Deportivo declared: \u201cA kid has become one of Barcelona\u2019s great hopes.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0c928ddf25f50433bce957d5983ccf6b21ca0a8b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0c928ddf25f50433bce957d5983ccf6b21ca0a8b/0_0_4640_3088/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fati runs with the ball against Valencia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fati runs with the ball against Valencia.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pau Barrena/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In the hope lies the risk, of course. There\u2019s caution amidst the celebration, even as some rush to proclaim the second coming. There\u2019s something attractive in youth that fades with time, even if the talent doesn\u2019t, an excitement in discovery that can\u2019t always be maintained. There\u2019s a joy in the subversion, the explosion, the moment that\u2019s hard to avoid and harder to maintain. Kids like Ansu bring hope, Jorge Valdano wrote, a hint of Marinaleda in his words, because they come to \u201cbreak the established order\u201d. And that utopia is difficult to meet, always just out of reach. With young players, it\u2019s not just about what they are but what they might become, future performances projected upon them and achievements assumed. The achievements of others too; every New Someone carries a weight they never wanted, good not be good enough. The man \u2013 the kid \u2013 Ansu overtook as Barcelona\u2019s youngest goalscorer is Bojan. \u201cPeople say my career wasn\u2019t what was expected: \u2018the new Messi\u2019,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/18/bojan-krkic-interview-anxiety-attacks-football\">he says</a>. \u201cWell, if you compare me with Messi \u2026 but what career did you expect?\u201d</p> \n<p>There\u2019s celebrity, pressure, demands, exposure, infancy immediately lost. At Barcelona that\u2019s especially true, weighed by the expectations of La Masia \u2013 as much a concept as a place, <a href=\"https://www.si.com/more-sports/2010/12/09/la-masia\">a spiritual home as much as a footballing one</a>. And all the more so amid the often-political debate of its declining relevance. Ansu\u2019s world is different now.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not normal,\u201d Valverde said. \u201cIt\u2019s all a bit exaggerated: it\u2019s not normal that his first touch is a goal, it\u2019s not normal that his second is an assist and his third almost goes into the top corner; everything will go back to normal. This will get bigger and bigger; between us we have to deflate it a bit and protect the player.\u201d Sergio Busquets said: \u201cHe\u2019s very young. We know what he is capable of, what he\u2019s doing, that the fans are excited, that people are comparing him to great players. We have to support him because we know hard times will come; he has to know where he is. He has the qualities. He\u2019s a great player, he\u2019s got a good head on him and he works hard. Hopefully this can be the beginning of a long history here.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/LaLigaEN/status/1172993588277448704\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The name on everyone's lips after this game was ANSU FATI...\ud83d\udc8e\ud83c\udf1f<br><br>\ud83d\udcfa Highlights <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bar%C3%A7aValencia?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Bar\u00e7aValencia</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/19XgX7O8tl\">pic.twitter.com/19XgX7O8tl</a></p>\u2014 LaLiga (@LaLigaEN) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LaLigaEN/status/1172993588277448704?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 14, 2019</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cWe have to give him time; he\u2019s 16,\u201d Clement Lenglet said, but it may be too late for that already.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe devil is called Ansu Fati,\u201d ran the headline in El Pa\u00eds, a hint of Messi\u2019s debut in the Gamper Trophy when Fabio Capello called him that.

      "bodyText": "This story starts in a self-proclaimed communist utopia, a tiny village in the Andaluc\u00edan countryside where Che Guevara looks out from the sports ground, Republican flags adorn the town hall and political murals are painted on walls; a small, isolated place with no police where much of the 2,626 population live in identical homes they built themselves and the town\u2019s seal depicts a dove of peace with an olive branch; where they organised raids on supermarkets to feed people, public salaries are equal, collectives work the fields, land confiscated from the aristocracy, and the mayor is fond of Che\u2019s line: only those who dream will someday see their dreams become reality. Which is appropriate, even if this reality wasn\u2019t the dream they had. One hundred and one kilometres east of Seville, Marinaleda is, as the title of Dan Hancox\u2019s fascinating book calls it, the village against the world. The mayor since 1979 is Juan Manuel S\u00e1nchez Gordillo, who has the kind of beard you\u2019re supposed to have when you\u2019re a founder of the Collective for Workers\u2019 Unity, an instigator of hunger strikes, and the political leader of a place like this \u2013 described as Spain\u2019s Robin Hood \u2013 when you\u2019ve been jailed seven times and the target of at least two assassination attempts. One day, or so it goes, S\u00e1nchez Gordillo met Bori, a Guinean who had left Bissau first and Portugal next to come to Spain alone after his wife became pregnant. Bori had nothing, was in a bad way, and had heard Marinaleda was a place where they looked after people. Thrust into the media lately, he says he became S\u00e1nchez Gordillo\u2019s driver (although other versions have him behind the wheel of a rubbish truck) and they became close. The mayor looked after him, gave him work, somewhere to stay, and helped to bring his family over. Bori also worked on the construction of the railway, and turned his hand to anything he could. His wife and two sons joined him and they set up home in Herrera, 10 kilometres away. Wearing swimming shorts and in bare feet, aged six, one of his sons went to play football at the local club, where they couldn\u2019t believe what they saw. They knew immediately; some even dashed to the family home to break the news. Unbeknown to Bori, it turned out his son was good at football. Very, very good at football. On Saturday night, he scored 111 seconds into his first ever start for Barcelona, standing there arms outstretched in front of 81,617 people. He is 16. When Ansu Fati was called up to train with the first team, he didn\u2019t eat and he didn\u2019t sleep, his dad said. Meanwhile, Bori and his wife cried. Ansu had never even played for the B team before. When he ran on at the Camp Nou, there was a look of incredulity in his eyes. At 16 years, 298 days he was the second youngest player ever to play for Barcelona \u2013 Vicen\u00e7 Mart\u00ednez was 18 days younger when he made his debut almost 80 years before \u2013 and he looked it, too: a competition winner whose prize was to play with a professional club. But then he started playing. And then he belonged. \u201cDaring,\u201d Valverde called him. But, no, that\u2019s not this week. That was three weeks ago now. That night, Bori announced that he could \u201cdie happy\u201d, but he would have missed so much more. The week after, Ansu came on as a sub at Osasuna. Six minutes later, he scored. At 16 years, 304 days, he was the youngest goalscorer in Barcelona\u2019s history, the third youngest to score a La Liga goal anywhere, ever. And then on Saturday night, 111 seconds into his first Camp Nou start, he scored again, aged 16 years and 318 days. They could barely believe this and Ansu had only just begun. This wasn\u2019t one of those things that just happens, a coincidence. It wasn\u2019t something you watch; it was something that takes you with it; something that seemed to take defenders with it too, disoriented and defeated, wondering if it\u2019s real. And the conclusion was that, yes, yes, it is. That he is. Within five minutes, Ansu had left Ezequiel Garay standing like someone had secretly nailed his feet to the floor, stepping past him, and laying it off perfectly for Frenkie de Jong to make it 2-0. No one younger had ever provided an assist and scored, and it still it went on. The next time he got it, there was a nutmeg; feet flashing, he stepped inside and bent the shot this close to the top corner. He\u2019d hardly been playing 10 minutes. Soon he went tumbling in the area, referee Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda S\u00e1nchez Mart\u00ednez pointing to him and shouting: \u201cAnsu, careful.\u201d Replays suggested that, far from a dive, it might actually have been a penalty, but it didn\u2019t matter. S\u00e1nchez Mart\u00ednez winked indulgently; Ansu smiled and carried on. It was, El Mundo said, \u201cone of those recitals that stirs the soul\u201d. When he controlled on the chest and flicked the ball backwards over the head of Daniel Wass, slipping past to get it again by the six-yard box just before half-time, it was getting silly. So silly that he seemed almost embarrassed to shoot afterwards, like that would be going too far. And yet it wasn\u2019t just silly: every pass was right, every decision too, the supposedly simple things that some find so hard. He was daring, took risks, but still completed almost 80% of his passes, only lost the ball once, and completed every dribble. By half-time, Valverde said, his muscles were feeling the strain. And so with an hour gone, and Barcelona 3-1 up, Ansu departed. The Camp Nou stood to hand him an ovation. Waiting on the touchline, applauding too, was Luis Su\u00e1rez, who scored a brilliant first within seconds to make it 4-1 and then added another on the way to a 5-2 victory over a depressed, disintegrating Valencia. Su\u00e1rez is almost twice his age: the day the Uruguayan made his debut, Ansu was two. \u201cAnsu enamours, Su\u00e1rez kills,\u201d ran AS\u2019s headline. \u201cWhat this kid\u2019s doing is something we have to take very seriously; the hour he played was an absolute scandal.\u201d Marca ran on: \u201cThe name\u2019s Fati, Ansu Fati,\u201d opening their match report with the same line El Mundo used for a headline: \u201cA star is born.\u201d El Mundo Deportivo declared: \u201cA kid has become one of Barcelona\u2019s great hopes.\u201d In the hope lies the risk, of course. There\u2019s caution amidst the celebration, even as some rush to proclaim the second coming. There\u2019s something attractive in youth that fades with time, even if the talent doesn\u2019t, an excitement in discovery that can\u2019t always be maintained. There\u2019s a joy in the subversion, the explosion, the moment that\u2019s hard to avoid and harder to maintain. Kids like Ansu bring hope, Jorge Valdano wrote, a hint of Marinaleda in his words, because they come to \u201cbreak the established order\u201d. And that utopia is difficult to meet, always just out of reach. With young players, it\u2019s not just about what they are but what they might become, future performances projected upon them and achievements assumed. The achievements of others too; every New Someone carries a weight they never wanted, good not be good enough. The man \u2013 the kid \u2013 Ansu overtook as Barcelona\u2019s youngest goalscorer is Bojan. \u201cPeople say my career wasn\u2019t what was expected: \u2018the new Messi\u2019,\u201d he says. \u201cWell, if you compare me with Messi \u2026 but what career did you expect?\u201d There\u2019s celebrity, pressure, demands, exposure, infancy immediately lost. At Barcelona that\u2019s especially true, weighed by the expectations of La Masia \u2013 as much a concept as a place, a spiritual home as much as a footballing one. And all the more so amid the often-political debate of its declining relevance. Ansu\u2019s world is different now. \u201cIt\u2019s not normal,\u201d Valverde said. \u201cIt\u2019s all a bit exaggerated: it\u2019s not normal that his first touch is a goal, it\u2019s not normal that his second is an assist and his third almost goes into the top corner; everything will go back to normal. This will get bigger and bigger; between us we have to deflate it a bit and protect the player.\u201d Sergio Busquets said: \u201cHe\u2019s very young. We know what he is capable of, what he\u2019s doing, that the fans are excited, that people are comparing him to great players. We have to support him because we know hard times will come; he has to know where he is. He has the qualities. He\u2019s a great player, he\u2019s got a good head on him and he works hard. Hopefully this can be the beginning of a long history here.\u201d \u201cWe have to give him time; he\u2019s 16,\u201d Clement Lenglet said, but it may be too late for that already. \u201cThe devil is called Ansu Fati,\u201d ran the headline in El Pa\u00eds, a hint of Messi\u2019s debut in the Gamper Trophy when Fabio Capello called him that. And while Ansu isn\u2019t Messi \u2013 although that photo was a public blessing \u2013 there\u2019s something about him. Asked if we were all going too far in all the excitement, the former Spain goalkeeper Santi Ca\u00f1izares replied simply: \u201cNo.\u201d Sport had already announced the arrival of Ansu Mania. Now, they echoed Victor Hugo Morales\u2019s famous commentary of Diego Maradona\u2019s goal against England, to ask: \u201cWhat planet did you come from?!\u201d Which planet? This one, Bissau to Barcelona, via Sevilla, Herrera and Marinaleda, the village where a metal sign declares: \u201cAnother world is possible.\u201d As Bori and his son are finding out. Talking points \u2022 Real Madrid: good, then bad. \u2022 Real Sociedad\u2019s new stadium was finally finished, rubbish running track banished forever, and they broke it in by breaking the only team to have won every game so far this season. The noise was superb, the performance too \u2013 especially from Martin Odegaard, who scored the first in a 2-0 win against Atl\u00e9tico. Nacho Monreal got the second. \u201cIt was a special game, it couldn\u2019t have gone any better; I could never have imagined anything as good as this,\u201d he said. All the stats showed how much better la Real were, but one stat is probably the most eloquent of all: 32. That\u2019s how much closer, in metres, the fans behind the goal are to the pitch now. \u2022 Joan Jordan\u2019s free-kick was good as Sevilla went top with a 1-0 win at Alav\u00e9s, but then along came Herv\u00edas for Valladolid as they drew with Osasuna, and his was ridiculous. Woof. Coach Sergio standing there grinning and rolling his eyes said more than anything else could. \u2022 More on Valencia\u2019s crisis to come, by the way. \u2022 \u201cIt\u2019s not football,\u201d Celta manager Fran Escrib\u00e1 said after his team spent most of the defeat against Granada playing with nine men after a new ruling \u2013 explained and accepted with admirable calm in a tunnel conversation between players and referee \u2013 and its VAR accomplice delivered another laughably light red card. And that\u2019s before we get on to the amount of time taken to do it. Game after game. Over nine minutes, in this case, if you\u2019re wondering. He\u2019s right.",

      "bodyText": "The Solomon Islands\u2019 government has voted to sever its longstanding ties with Taiwan and take up diplomatic relations with Beijing. The move is a huge blow to self-ruled Taiwan, which has lost six allies since 2016, and to Taiwan\u2019s president, Tsai Ing-wen, who is seeking re-election in January amid rising tension with China. It has sparked protests in the Solomon Islands, according to local media. The Solomon Islands, a country of about 600,000 people in the south Pacific, is the latest country to switch allegiance to China since Tsai came to office in 2016, following Burkina Faso, the Dominican Republic, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe, Panama and El Salvador. Taiwan announced it was severing ties with the Solomon Islands immediately after learning the Pacific nation had decided to switch diplomatic recognition to China, which it said was \u201cextremely regrettable\u201d. \u201cWe sincerely regret and strongly condemn their government\u2019s decision to establish diplomatic relations with China,\u201d said President Tsai Ing-wen on Monday. Tsai said Taiwan would close its embassy on Tuesday, lowering its flag at 11:30am local time and recall all technical and medical personnel stationed there. \u201cIt is indeed regrettable that their unfinished cooperative projects must come to an end, and it is a loss for Solomon Islands people. However, this is the choice that Solomon Islands\u2019 government has made, leaving us with no other option but to respond in this way,\u201d she said. Tsai accused China of engaging in \u201cdollar diplomacy\u201d in the region in order to undermine Taiwan. \u201cOver the past few years, China has continually used financial and political pressure to suppress Taiwan\u2019s international space,\u201d she said. China\u2019s foreign ministry spokesman welcomed the decision, saying: \u201cThe Chinese side highly appreciates the Solomon Islands government\u2019s decision to ... sever the so-called \u2018diplomatic relations\u2019 with Taiwan authorities.\u201d Taiwan has been a de facto sovereign nation since the end of a civil war in 1949, but China still views the island as its territory and has vowed to bring it under central control. Over the decades, dozens of countries, including the US and most western nations, have switched recognition to Beijing, leaving just a handful of countries loyal to Taiwan, largely in Latin America and the Pacific. The decision of the Solomon Islands to switch allegiance followed the recommendation of a taskforce commissioned by the Solomon Islands\u2019 government to investigate the benefits to the country of switching ties. The report, released on Friday, advised that the government switch ties to China and invite it to establish a diplomatic mission in the capital, Honiara, on the island of Guadalcanal. \u201cThe findings reveal that Solomon Islands stands to benefit a lot if it switches and normalises diplomatic relations with PRC [People\u2019s Republic of China],\u201d the taskforce said. The diplomatic switch reduces the number of countries that recognise Taiwan to 16. The south Pacific has been a diplomatic stronghold for Taiwan, where formal ties with six island nations made up more than a third of its total alliances, though China has in recent years been expanding its influence in the region. The Solomon Islands was by far the largest remaining Pacific ally for Taiwan. Its population of 600,000 is larger than all of Taiwan\u2019s remaining allies in the region \u2013 Palau, Tuvalu, Nauru, Kiribati and Marshall Islands \u2013 combined.

Trump, of course, announced soon after taking office that he was withdrawing the US from the Paris agreement, the landmark treaty signed at the last big UN climate summit in 2015. Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the UN secretary general, convened this week\u2019s summit precisely because the US and most other countries remain far from honoring their Paris pledges to reduce heat-trapping emissions enough to prevent catastrophic climate disruption.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/09/archive-5-zip/giv-3902d8jdxgN0Ltya/index.html\" data-alt=\".\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/09/archive-5-zip/giv-3902d8jdxgN0Ltya/index.html\">.</a> </figure>  <p>The events of the coming days \u2013 including a global climate strike on 20 September by the activists whose protests in the past year have pushed the term \u201cclimate emergency\u201d into news reports around the world \u2013 may help answer a question that has loomed over humanity since Trump\u2019s election: can the rest of the world save itself from climate breakdown if the richest, most powerful nation on earth is pulling in the opposite direction?</p> <p>Adopted in December 2015,<a href=\"https://unfccc.int/process/conferences/pastconferences/paris-climate-change-conference-november-2015/paris-agreement/\"> the Paris </a><a href=\"https://unfccc.int/process/conferences/pastconferences/paris-climate-change-conference-november-2015/paris-agreement/\">agreement</a> stands as the strongest achievement of climate diplomacy since governments first debated the issue at the UN Earth Summit in 1992. In a shock to climate insiders, the agreement not only committed signatory governments to limit temperature rise to the relatively less dangerous level of 2C. It also obliged governments to keep temperature rise \u201cwell below\u201d 2C and, in a major victory for the most vulnerable countries, to strive for 1.5C. That half-degree may not sound like much, but it spells the difference between life and death for low-lying coastal nations such as Bangladesh and island states such as the Maldives \u2013 two of many places that, science says, would literally disappear beneath the waves with more than 1.5C of warming.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/sep/15/americans-climate-change-crisis-cbs-poll\">'Americans are waking up': two thirds say climate crisis must be addressed</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The announced US withdrawal from the Paris agreement was big news but also widely misunderstood news. Despite Trump\u2019s bluster, the US withdrawal still has not happened. Precisely to guard against such capriciousness, the negotiators in Paris stipulated that every signatory was legally bound to remain in the agreement until four years after the treaty took effect, which would only happen after countries responsible for 55% of global greenhouse gas emissions ratified it. Thus, the Paris agreement did not take effect until 4 November 2016. That means the US cannot leave until 4 November 2020 \u2013 which, not by accident, is one day after the US 2020 presidential election. If Trump loses that election, his successor almost certainly would move to keep the US in the Paris agreement.</p> <h2><strong>A 3-5C temperature rise could \u2018destroy civilization\u2019</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b843069ba14ecb347699b60aa547e1812f21881c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b843069ba14ecb347699b60aa547e1812f21881c/0_126_5376_3226/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Luis Alfonso de Alba, left, special envoy for the United Nations 2019 Climate Action Summit, speaks at the UN headquarters in New York.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Luis Alfonso de Alba, left, special envoy for the United Nations 2019 climate action summit, speaks at the UN headquarters in New York.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Li Muzi/Xinhua/Barcroft Media</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cDon\u2019t bring a speech, bring a plan!\u201d For months now, that\u2019s what Guterres has been telling heads of state and government. Instead of the endless blah-blah-blah heard at most UN meetings, Guterres wants this summit to be more like \u201cshow-and-tell\u201d, a meeting where governments share concrete and replicable examples of how they are cutting emissions and boosting resilience to the climate impacts already unfolding. As such, the summit aims to address a glaring deficiency of the Paris agreement. In part, because the agreement made emissions cuts voluntary, global emissions have continued to increase since 2015. On <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climate-change-un/global-temperatures-on-track-for-3-5-degree-rise-by-2100-u-n-idUSKCN1NY186/\">current trends</a>, the earth is heading towards 3-5C of temperature rise \u2013 enough, scientists warn, to destroy civilization as we know it.</p> <p>\u201cThe secretary general has very clearly demanded that all participants identify very concrete measures that can be implemented immediately,\u201d Luis Alfonso de Alba, Guterres\u2019s special envoy for the summit, said in an interview with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/15/guardian-leads-global-news-collaboration-covering-climate-now\">Covering Climate Now</a>, a collaboration of 250 news outlets around the world to strengthen coverage of the climate story. \u201cWhat we need is for all actors to put in practice their commitments [and to] recognize that whatever they had in mind before, they need to do much more \u2013 because climate change is running faster than we are, the situation is much more serious than we thought.\u201d</p> <p>Asked how the world can meet the \u201cwell below 2C\u201d target when the current US government is doing all it can to increase global warming, Alba, a career diplomat from Mexico, steered clear of criticizing the Trump administration. \u201cWe need higher political will not only in one country but in a number of them,\u201d he said, before adding: \u201cWe\u2019re very much impressed by what states, cities and businesses are doing in the US to move into renewables \u2026 We are quite confident that the US will contribute to solutions, even if the decision to withdraw by the current administration is maintained.\u201d</p> <p>Indeed, then governor Jerry Brown announced at a climate summit last September that he signed an executive order committing California, the world\u2019s fifth-biggest economy, to achieve zero carbon emissions by 2045. This summer, New York state, whose economic output is roughly equivalent to Russia\u2019s, passed a law requiring the state to achieve 100% carbon-free electricity by 2040. The <a href=\"https://www.under2coalition.org/\">Under2 Coalition</a>, a group of more than 220 state and local governments around the world representing 43% of the global economy, is likewise committed to keeping temperature rise well below 2C.</p> <p>The climb remains very steep, however. Scientists with the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change declared last October in their landmark<a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/\"> Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5C</a> that humanity had to slash emissions by 45% by 2030, on the way to net-zero by 2050, to hit the 1.5C target. Failure to do so would condemn many millions of people, particularly in poor and vulnerable countries, to destitution and death and make irreversible global warming more likely. Such dramatic emissions reductions, the scientists added, would require the transformation of the global energy, agricultural, transportation and other sectors at a speed and scale without precedent in human history.</p> <p>China, the other climate superpower along with the US, will therefore have to do better as well. China won plaudits in the lead-up to the Paris summit in 2015 by closing many of its coal-fired power plants. But coal burning in China has recently crept back up, and Beijing has also financed construction of coal plants in other countries, particularly in support of its massive \u201cBelt and Road\u201d initiative to construct ports, railways and other infrastructure across Asia to the Middle East, Africa and Europe. Alba commends China for promising to go beyond the emissions reductions it pledged in Paris, but he adds, \u201cWe are asking them to do much more and in particular to green the Belt and Road initiative. It\u2019s quite important because of the scale of that initiative that they do not support coal plants but instead renewable energy.\u201d</p> <h2>New era of climate activism offers hope</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b34cb4e3152fb119a35840b87e3424a129ded36a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b34cb4e3152fb119a35840b87e3424a129ded36a/0_10_4857_2915/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The environmental activist Greta Thunberg, along with climate activist Alexandria Villasenor and friends protest outside the UN headquarters in New York on 6 September.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The environmental activists Greta Thunberg, Alexandria Villasenor and friends protest at the UN headquarters in New York on 6 September.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Europa Newswire/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When Guterres gavels the summit\u2019s plenary session to order next Monday, the 12-year deadline outlined by the IPCC scientists will have shrunk closer to 11. Meanwhile, the burning of the Amazon, Hurricane Dorian\u2019s devastation of the Bahamas, this summer\u2019s heatwaves across much of the northern hemisphere, and countless less-heralded disasters illustrate that climate disruption is no longer a worrisome future specter but a punishing current reality.</p> <p>Alba nevertheless draws hope from the heightened public concern and activism against the climate threat. \u201cCompared to 10 years ago, the level of public involvement is very different,\u201d Alba said, \u201cand that\u2019s to a large extent because the news media is talking about it more and young activists are demanding action.\u201d</p> <p>In the United States, activists with the Sunrise Movement and other groups have protested against Democratic and Republican politicians alike and demanded that the government implement a<a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/116/bills/hres109/BILLS-116hres109ih.pdf\"> Green New Deal</a>. Championed by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the progressive congresswoman from New York, and modeled on the New Deal jobs and investment programs President Franklin Roosevelt implemented to pull the US out of the Great Depression in the 1930s, the Green New Deal calls for the government to kickstart the transformations of energy and other sectors the IPCC says are needed. Such a massive investment program will also, the activists say, create millions of jobs and reduce economic inequality. Central to the plan is \u201cclimate justice\u201d, the notion that poor and non-white individuals and communities have suffered worst from climate change and therefore should get precedence for the jobs and opportunities flowing from a Green New Deal.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cc59b37bd938aef2f634e509f7d05391b6bdd1cd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cc59b37bd938aef2f634e509f7d05391b6bdd1cd/0_0_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez greets audiences following a televised town hall event on the Green New Deal in the Bronx borough of New York City in March.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez greets audiences following a televised town hall event on the Green New Deal in the Bronx borough of New York City in March.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeenah Moon/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Activist pressure has helped make the Green New Deal the de facto position of the Democratic party in the US, while also spreading the idea overseas. Each of the leading Democratic candidates in the race to replace Trump has endorsed one version or another of a Green New Deal. Bernie Sanders <a href=\"https://berniesanders.com/issues/green-new-deal/\">proposes</a> a particularly robust program that will, he promises, \u201cend unemployment\u201d by creating 20m new jobs and also help developing nations dump fossil fuels in favor of renewables.</p> <p>Guterres has gone out of his way to boost the visibility of the climate youth, most notably Greta Thunberg, the Swedish teenager who is the best-known face of the climate movement. Thunberg\u2019s \u201cSchool Strike For Climate\u201d, begun a year ago in her home town of Stockholm, spread like wildfire around the world, inspiring hundreds of thousands of students to skip classes and take to the streets to demand that governments, in Thunberg\u2019s words, \u201cact like the house is on fire \u2013 because it is\u201d. Guterres has invited Thunberg to keynote a special one-day youth climate summit on 21 September and also to address world leaders at the plenary session on 23 September.</p> <p>Alba recognizes that the public is sometimes skeptical of UN conferences, and he acknowledges that the UN \u201cdoes not have the means to enforce\u201d the commitments made by governments in the Paris agreement. Instead, he puts his faith, again, in the ability of public pressure to compel governments to do the right thing. \u201cAs in many other parts of international law,\u201d he says, \u201cthe enforcement rests in the follow-up and the \u2018name and shame\u2019 role of civil society \u2013 to expose that a country is not complying with what they\u2019ve committed to. The media plays an important role there, and so do activists.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, Alba\u2019s own teenage son has given him advice on how to make the case for action: don\u2019t talk so much about the future that youth will inherit but rather about the climate disasters happening now. \u201cHe had a point,\u201d says Alba. \u201cThis is an emergency we need to deal with today, not tomorrow. Talking about 2030 and 2050 is important because science gives us those dates for achieving certain objectives, but there\u2019s the danger that it tells people that we have time to make these changes. And that is a mistake.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p>This article was amended on 20 September 2019 after originally reporting that EPA administrator Andrew Wheeler would lead the US delegation to the UN Climate Action Summit.

      "bodyText": "This story originally appeared in the Nation. It is republished here as part of the Guardian\u2019s partnership with Covering Climate Now, a global collaboration of more than 250 news outlets to strengthen coverage of the climate story. As world leaders converge on New York City for the United Nations climate action Summit on 23 September, they enter what may be the most consequential week in climate politics since Donald Trump\u2019s surprise election as president of the United States in 2016. Trump, of course, announced soon after taking office that he was withdrawing the US from the Paris agreement, the landmark treaty signed at the last big UN climate summit in 2015. Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the UN secretary general, convened this week\u2019s summit precisely because the US and most other countries remain far from honoring their Paris pledges to reduce heat-trapping emissions enough to prevent catastrophic climate disruption. The events of the coming days \u2013 including a global climate strike on 20 September by the activists whose protests in the past year have pushed the term \u201cclimate emergency\u201d into news reports around the world \u2013 may help answer a question that has loomed over humanity since Trump\u2019s election: can the rest of the world save itself from climate breakdown if the richest, most powerful nation on earth is pulling in the opposite direction? Adopted in December 2015, the Paris agreement stands as the strongest achievement of climate diplomacy since governments first debated the issue at the UN Earth Summit in 1992. In a shock to climate insiders, the agreement not only committed signatory governments to limit temperature rise to the relatively less dangerous level of 2C. It also obliged governments to keep temperature rise \u201cwell below\u201d 2C and, in a major victory for the most vulnerable countries, to strive for 1.5C. That half-degree may not sound like much, but it spells the difference between life and death for low-lying coastal nations such as Bangladesh and island states such as the Maldives \u2013 two of many places that, science says, would literally disappear beneath the waves with more than 1.5C of warming. The announced US withdrawal from the Paris agreement was big news but also widely misunderstood news. Despite Trump\u2019s bluster, the US withdrawal still has not happened. Precisely to guard against such capriciousness, the negotiators in Paris stipulated that every signatory was legally bound to remain in the agreement until four years after the treaty took effect, which would only happen after countries responsible for 55% of global greenhouse gas emissions ratified it. Thus, the Paris agreement did not take effect until 4 November 2016. That means the US cannot leave until 4 November 2020 \u2013 which, not by accident, is one day after the US 2020 presidential election. If Trump loses that election, his successor almost certainly would move to keep the US in the Paris agreement. A 3-5C temperature rise could \u2018destroy civilization\u2019 \u201cDon\u2019t bring a speech, bring a plan!\u201d For months now, that\u2019s what Guterres has been telling heads of state and government. Instead of the endless blah-blah-blah heard at most UN meetings, Guterres wants this summit to be more like \u201cshow-and-tell\u201d, a meeting where governments share concrete and replicable examples of how they are cutting emissions and boosting resilience to the climate impacts already unfolding. As such, the summit aims to address a glaring deficiency of the Paris agreement. In part, because the agreement made emissions cuts voluntary, global emissions have continued to increase since 2015. On current trends, the earth is heading towards 3-5C of temperature rise \u2013 enough, scientists warn, to destroy civilization as we know it. \u201cThe secretary general has very clearly demanded that all participants identify very concrete measures that can be implemented immediately,\u201d Luis Alfonso de Alba, Guterres\u2019s special envoy for the summit, said in an interview with Covering Climate Now, a collaboration of 250 news outlets around the world to strengthen coverage of the climate story. \u201cWhat we need is for all actors to put in practice their commitments [and to] recognize that whatever they had in mind before, they need to do much more \u2013 because climate change is running faster than we are, the situation is much more serious than we thought.\u201d Asked how the world can meet the \u201cwell below 2C\u201d target when the current US government is doing all it can to increase global warming, Alba, a career diplomat from Mexico, steered clear of criticizing the Trump administration. \u201cWe need higher political will not only in one country but in a number of them,\u201d he said, before adding: \u201cWe\u2019re very much impressed by what states, cities and businesses are doing in the US to move into renewables \u2026 We are quite confident that the US will contribute to solutions, even if the decision to withdraw by the current administration is maintained.\u201d Indeed, then governor Jerry Brown announced at a climate summit last September that he signed an executive order committing California, the world\u2019s fifth-biggest economy, to achieve zero carbon emissions by 2045. This summer, New York state, whose economic output is roughly equivalent to Russia\u2019s, passed a law requiring the state to achieve 100% carbon-free electricity by 2040. The Under2 Coalition, a group of more than 220 state and local governments around the world representing 43% of the global economy, is likewise committed to keeping temperature rise well below 2C. The climb remains very steep, however. Scientists with the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change declared last October in their landmark Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5C that humanity had to slash emissions by 45% by 2030, on the way to net-zero by 2050, to hit the 1.5C target. Failure to do so would condemn many millions of people, particularly in poor and vulnerable countries, to destitution and death and make irreversible global warming more likely. Such dramatic emissions reductions, the scientists added, would require the transformation of the global energy, agricultural, transportation and other sectors at a speed and scale without precedent in human history. China, the other climate superpower along with the US, will therefore have to do better as well. China won plaudits in the lead-up to the Paris summit in 2015 by closing many of its coal-fired power plants. But coal burning in China has recently crept back up, and Beijing has also financed construction of coal plants in other countries, particularly in support of its massive \u201cBelt and Road\u201d initiative to construct ports, railways and other infrastructure across Asia to the Middle East, Africa and Europe. Alba commends China for promising to go beyond the emissions reductions it pledged in Paris, but he adds, \u201cWe are asking them to do much more and in particular to green the Belt and Road initiative. It\u2019s quite important because of the scale of that initiative that they do not support coal plants but instead renewable energy.\u201d New era of climate activism offers hope When Guterres gavels the summit\u2019s plenary session to order next Monday, the 12-year deadline outlined by the IPCC scientists will have shrunk closer to 11. Meanwhile, the burning of the Amazon, Hurricane Dorian\u2019s devastation of the Bahamas, this summer\u2019s heatwaves across much of the northern hemisphere, and countless less-heralded disasters illustrate that climate disruption is no longer a worrisome future specter but a punishing current reality. Alba nevertheless draws hope from the heightened public concern and activism against the climate threat. \u201cCompared to 10 years ago, the level of public involvement is very different,\u201d Alba said, \u201cand that\u2019s to a large extent because the news media is talking about it more and young activists are demanding action.\u201d In the United States, activists with the Sunrise Movement and other groups have protested against Democratic and Republican politicians alike and demanded that the government implement a Green New Deal. Championed by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the progressive congresswoman from New York, and modeled on the New Deal jobs and investment programs President Franklin Roosevelt implemented to pull the US out of the Great Depression in the 1930s, the Green New Deal calls for the government to kickstart the transformations of energy and other sectors the IPCC says are needed. Such a massive investment program will also, the activists say, create millions of jobs and reduce economic inequality. Central to the plan is \u201cclimate justice\u201d, the notion that poor and non-white individuals and communities have suffered worst from climate change and therefore should get precedence for the jobs and opportunities flowing from a Green New Deal. Activist pressure has helped make the Green New Deal the de facto position of the Democratic party in the US, while also spreading the idea overseas. Each of the leading Democratic candidates in the race to replace Trump has endorsed one version or another of a Green New Deal. Bernie Sanders proposes a particularly robust program that will, he promises, \u201cend unemployment\u201d by creating 20m new jobs and also help developing nations dump fossil fuels in favor of renewables. Guterres has gone out of his way to boost the visibility of the climate youth, most notably Greta Thunberg, the Swedish teenager who is the best-known face of the climate movement. Thunberg\u2019s \u201cSchool Strike For Climate\u201d, begun a year ago in her home town of Stockholm, spread like wildfire around the world, inspiring hundreds of thousands of students to skip classes and take to the streets to demand that governments, in Thunberg\u2019s words, \u201cact like the house is on fire \u2013 because it is\u201d. Guterres has invited Thunberg to keynote a special one-day youth climate summit on 21 September and also to address world leaders at the plenary session on 23 September. Alba recognizes that the public is sometimes skeptical of UN conferences, and he acknowledges that the UN \u201cdoes not have the means to enforce\u201d the commitments made by governments in the Paris agreement. Instead, he puts his faith, again, in the ability of public pressure to compel governments to do the right thing. \u201cAs in many other parts of international law,\u201d he says, \u201cthe enforcement rests in the follow-up and the \u2018name and shame\u2019 role of civil society \u2013 to expose that a country is not complying with what they\u2019ve committed to. The media plays an important role there, and so do activists.\u201d Meanwhile, Alba\u2019s own teenage son has given him advice on how to make the case for action: don\u2019t talk so much about the future that youth will inherit but rather about the climate disasters happening now. \u201cHe had a point,\u201d says Alba. \u201cThis is an emergency we need to deal with today, not tomorrow. Talking about 2030 and 2050 is important because science gives us those dates for achieving certain objectives, but there\u2019s the danger that it tells people that we have time to make these changes. And that is a mistake.\u201d This article was amended on 20 September 2019 after originally reporting that EPA administrator Andrew Wheeler would lead the US delegation to the UN Climate Action Summit. In fact, the delegation will be led by Marcia Bernicat, the principal deputy assistant secretary of state in the state department.",

His latest proposals on crime, leaked by a \u201cWhitehall source\u201d, are a shameless lurch to the wilder shores of rightwing populism.

He wants \u201clife to mean life\u201d for child murderers, together with more prison places, simpler stop-and-search and less early release. His source says \u201cmost people think all parties and the courts have lost the plot on sentencing\u201d. Johnson will act \u201caggressively\u201d.

The Oakervee review, led in conjunction with prominent critics of the scheme, is expected to assess the costs and benefits of HS2, and could recommend a modified version of the railway, such as running slower trains or changing its London terminus. Earlier this month, the government revealed it expected HS2 to be delayed by five to seven years, and to run another \u00a326bn over budget, revising its price up from \u00a356bn in 2015 to \u00a388bn, in line with inflation. Based on a report from the HS2 chairman, Allan Cook, it said the first phase from London and Birmingham would probably not be ready until 2031, instead of 2026, while the entire network including lines to Manchester and Leeds might not be completed until 2040, instead of 2033.",

      "bodyText": "A mass trial of 47 lawyers, doctors, psychologists and political activists began and ended in 25 minutes in Madrid on Monday. A plea deal allowed the accused to avoid sentences of up to 20 years on charges of membership of the now-dissolved armed separatist group Eta. Defendants agreed to a deal that recognised the charges against them, but which will see the majority of defendants sentenced to suspended sentences of two years each, while two others face jail time of five months. The abrupt resolution took place on the first day of the trial at Madrid\u2019s audiencia nacional, and came as verdicts were expected in the mass trial of 12 Catalan separatist politicians next month. Similar plea deals were also reached in two trials of Basque political activists in January and April 2016. Prosecutors in the latest Basque case had argued that the 47 accused were members of a network called koordinazioa taldea, or coordination group, which the state alleged constituted a key part of Eta\u2019s overall strategy. They faced charges that they formed part of Eta\u2019s \u201cprison front\u201d, alongside other allegations such as financing terrorism. The defendants and their supporters had maintained the terrorism allegations were an attempt to criminalise people who advocate for the human rights of Basque political prisoners, fugitives, their families and those affected by state violence, such as victims of torture. After a bloody five-decade conflict with the Spanish state, Eta declared a permanent ceasefire in 2011 and formally announced its complete dissolution in 2018, declaring the pursuit of purely political means for its goal of an independent, socialist Basque country. Several hundred Basque political prisoners remain in jail, with others living as fugitives outside Spain. One of the defendants, Amaia Izko, was arrested along with other lawyers in February 2015 as she tried to enter the audiencia nacional \u2013 the Spanish court responsible for accusations of terrorism and organised crime \u2013 to work on a mass trial of Basques accused of terrorism. She faced nine years in prison accused of membership of Eta. Speaking outside the court after the trial ended, Izko explained that the 47 defendants had taken a collective decision to accept the deal. She said two defendants, Arantza Zulueta and Jon Enparantza, had taken \u201cthe responsible decision to sacrifice themselves to make this outcome possible\u201d and now faced five months in prison, accused of being in leadership roles. Speaking to the Guardian before the trial, Izko said: \u201cWe\u2019re standing here accused of terrorism, with some of us, as lawyers, accused based on the practice of our profession and our defence of cases like this. \u201cThere\u2019s a feeling that the state is getting revenge on us for the work we\u2019ve done as lawyers in condemning the lack of legal guarantees in the audiencia nacional, in condemning cases of solitary confinement and cases of torture.\u201d The audiencia nacional has long faced accusations of being a political court, due in part to its birth as the successor to the public order tribunal of the fascist dictator Francisco Franco\u2019s regime, the fact its judges are political appointees and its role in investigating and trying politically controversial cases. In this trial, Izko and others saw a politically motivated attempt by the Spanish state to \u201ccriminalise solidarity\u201d and to \u201chinder the peace process and the political normalisation and coexistence which started in the Basque country\u201d after the ceasefire and dissolution of Eta. The trial is the result of a wave of arrests in 2013, 2014 and 2015, which targeted five separate groups working on behalf of Basque political prisoners, fugitives and their families. Among those facing terrorism charges were 18 members of Herrira, a collective which campaigns for the rights of Basque prisoners and fugitives; 12 lawyers who have defended Basque political prisoners, including those accused of Eta membership; eight people who worked as mediators between Basque political prisoners and Basque civil society; two members of Etxerat, an organisation of family members of Basque political prisoners; and two members of Jaiki Hadi, a collective of medical professionals who support current and former prisoners, their families and victims of torture by the Spanish state. Iker Urbina, one of the 11 lawyers defending the 47, argued that the prosecution\u2019s accusation of terrorism was not only politically motivated but also legally inconsistent, as all accusations related to activity from 2012. \u201cThe acts which the defendants are accused of happened after ETA publicly declared the cessation of its armed activities in 2011 \u2026 and had already expressed its willingness to disappear,\u201d he said. An estimated 50,000 people marched in Bilbao on Saturday to express solidarity with the defendants. \u201cThis expression of solidarity has been incredibly important to allow for this agreement. There\u2019s been incredible support,\u201d said the Basque journalist Patxi Gaztelumendi.",

He later sought to reiterate to his fans that he wasn\u2019t abandoning music altogether after he accused the media of \u201clooting\u201d his words. \u201cI only replied that I would no longer play the piano solo as I would [play] worse than before,\u201d he wrote on Facebook. \u201cI already announced this two years ago \u2026 but I didn\u2019t retire, I continue to make music, and better than before! I am very happy with what I do, but it pains me when you insist on the piano as I struggle a lot, because I don\u2019t have the same quality.\u201d Bosso has conducted several orchestras, including the London Symphony Orchestra, and won several awards for his compositions, which have also featured in films and theatre productions.",

      "body": "<p>In Italy, the Serie A table is always front-page news. On Saturday, Sunday and Monday, <em>La Classifica</em> appears on the cover of all the nation\u2019s major sports papers. This season is only three games old but readers want to see those numbers. And especially on a weekend when Juventus have been knocked off their perch.</p> \n<p>The <em>Bianconeri</em> had occupied first place \u2013 or at least a share of it \u2013 for 552 consecutive days, dating back to March 2018. That sequence ended after they drew 0-0 away to Fiorentina, leaving room for Inter to overtake by extending their own perfect start with a 1-0 victory over Udinese.</p> \n<p>It is far too soon for any of this to matter. And yet, at the same time, it does. Last season, Juventus led the league from the first weekend to the last. They remain clear favourites to win a ninth straight Scudetto but at least this time someone else will get a turn to front-run.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/16/italian-pundit-sacked-saying-only-way-to-stop-lukaku-is-to-give-him-bananas\">Italian football pundit sacked for racist on-air remarks about Romelu Lukaku</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Juventus, furthermore, did look vulnerable on Saturday. This was Maurizio Sarri\u2019s first game in the dugout for his new club, after recovering from pneumonia. Fiorentina had the better of the play, taking 18 shots to the visitors\u2019 eight and earning 10 corners without giving up a single one.</p> \n<p>Douglas Costa\u2019s early injury hurt Juventus, and Miralem Pjanic also had to be withdrawn before half-time, but those factors alone could not excuse the ponderousness of the champions\u2019 play. Fiorentina were simply quicker to the ball. The dynamism of Gaetano Castrovilli\u2019s emerging talent was to the fore in sweltering heat, but the defining image was that of a 36-year-old Franck Rib\u00e9ry running down Cristiano Ronaldo after giving up a five-yard head-start.</p> \n<p>The Frenchman had been just a step too slow to punish a mistake by Matthijs de Ligt in the 16th minute, when the defender miscued a backpass, sending the ball square along the edge of Juventus\u2019s six-yard box. Wojciech Szcz\u0119sny, having endured a near calamity of his own when he accidentally booted the ball into Federico Chiesa moments earlier, beat Rib\u00e9ry to it at the back post.</p> \n<p>Sarri cited the temperature, early kick-off and tired legs from international duty as mitigating factors. Those excuses drew a response from Antonio Conte. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say anything,\u201d said the Inter manager, \u201cotherwise we would have to bring out the balance sheets and the look at the estates. Let\u2019s just say that someone needs to stay calm and serene because they are on the strong side.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/PremierSportsTV/status/1172974976028332032\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\ud83d\udd35\u26ab Inter come away with a 1-0 win against 10-man Udinese and Antonio Conte's team go top of Serie A! <a href=\"https://t.co/uPPOhf092f\">pic.twitter.com/uPPOhf092f</a></p>\u2014 Premier Sports \ud83d\udcfa (@PremierSportsTV) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PremierSportsTV/status/1172974976028332032?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 14, 2019</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>Those sounded like the first shots fired in what will no doubt develop into a season-long back-and-forth. Sarri replaced Conte as manager of Arezzo in 2006, only for the latter to be reappointed before the end of the campaign \u2013 returning with barbed remarks about the team\u2019s fitness. The favour was returned when Sarri succeeded Conte at Chelsea, expressing surprise at the lack of tactical organisation in the team.</p> \n<p>For now, Conte is being careful not to puff up his own club\u2019s prospects. The truth is that Inter look far from an all-conquering side despite having collected maximum points. They were grateful against Udinese to the hot-headedness of Rodrigo De Paul, sent off after 35 minutes for slapping Antonio Candreva.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/sep/16/leipzig-cling-on-bayern-munich-point-nagelsmann-forward-bundesliga\">Leipzig cling to Bayern juggernaut and show way ahead for Nagelsmann</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>What the <em>Nerazzurri</em> do have is an emerging star in Stefano Sensi, the 24-year-old midfielder signed from Sassuolo this summer. He had already grabbed his first goal for the club in the season-opening rout of Lecce, and it was his dazzling <em>Veronica </em>(a pirouette turn) that drew the foul for the penalty to seal Inter\u2019s victory over Cagliari. On Saturday he added a match-winner of his own.</p> \n<p>It was a remarkable goal, Sensi beating Rodrigo Bec\u00e3o to a header despite giving up almost a foot in height . The delivery had come from Diego God\u00edn, advancing out of the back to support the attack \u2013 another positive note for the manager, who had spoken during pre-game interviews about his desire for defenders to contribute to build-up play.</p> \n<p>Sensi looks already like a classic Conte player: small in stature yet an enormous on-pitch presence, breaking the lines with his runs and committing furiously to winning back lost balls as well. He lined up in an advanced position, just behind the attack, at San Siro, yet only two players on the pitch had more touches. None had as many shots on target.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b4c366cea10572cd1154621b5d09b279ebd26b85\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b4c366cea10572cd1154621b5d09b279ebd26b85/0_0_3600_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stefano Sensi (second left) is congratulated after opening the scoring.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stefano Sensi (second left) is congratulated after opening the scoring.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Miguel Medina/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Romelu Lukaku had a quieter game, but that did not prevent one pundit<em>, </em>Luciano Passirani, from dropping some alarming racism into the public discourse when he suggested on local TV station Telelombardia that the only way to stop the striker <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/16/italian-pundit-sacked-saying-only-way-to-stop-lukaku-is-to-give-him-bananas\">was to give him 10 bananas</a>.

Verona took a different approach, putting out a pair of tweets in which they questioned whether the abuse of Kessie, along with reported taunts of the Milan keeper Gianluigi Donnarumma, had happened at all.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe \u2018buuu\u2019 for Kessie?

      "bodyText": "In Italy, the Serie A table is always front-page news. On Saturday, Sunday and Monday, La Classifica appears on the cover of all the nation\u2019s major sports papers. This season is only three games old but readers want to see those numbers. And especially on a weekend when Juventus have been knocked off their perch. The Bianconeri had occupied first place \u2013 or at least a share of it \u2013 for 552 consecutive days, dating back to March 2018. That sequence ended after they drew 0-0 away to Fiorentina, leaving room for Inter to overtake by extending their own perfect start with a 1-0 victory over Udinese. It is far too soon for any of this to matter. And yet, at the same time, it does. Last season, Juventus led the league from the first weekend to the last. They remain clear favourites to win a ninth straight Scudetto but at least this time someone else will get a turn to front-run. Juventus, furthermore, did look vulnerable on Saturday. This was Maurizio Sarri\u2019s first game in the dugout for his new club, after recovering from pneumonia. Fiorentina had the better of the play, taking 18 shots to the visitors\u2019 eight and earning 10 corners without giving up a single one. Douglas Costa\u2019s early injury hurt Juventus, and Miralem Pjanic also had to be withdrawn before half-time, but those factors alone could not excuse the ponderousness of the champions\u2019 play. Fiorentina were simply quicker to the ball. The dynamism of Gaetano Castrovilli\u2019s emerging talent was to the fore in sweltering heat, but the defining image was that of a 36-year-old Franck Rib\u00e9ry running down Cristiano Ronaldo after giving up a five-yard head-start. The Frenchman had been just a step too slow to punish a mistake by Matthijs de Ligt in the 16th minute, when the defender miscued a backpass, sending the ball square along the edge of Juventus\u2019s six-yard box. Wojciech Szcz\u0119sny, having endured a near calamity of his own when he accidentally booted the ball into Federico Chiesa moments earlier, beat Rib\u00e9ry to it at the back post. Sarri cited the temperature, early kick-off and tired legs from international duty as mitigating factors. Those excuses drew a response from Antonio Conte. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say anything,\u201d said the Inter manager, \u201cotherwise we would have to bring out the balance sheets and the look at the estates. Let\u2019s just say that someone needs to stay calm and serene because they are on the strong side.\u201d Those sounded like the first shots fired in what will no doubt develop into a season-long back-and-forth. Sarri replaced Conte as manager of Arezzo in 2006, only for the latter to be reappointed before the end of the campaign \u2013 returning with barbed remarks about the team\u2019s fitness. The favour was returned when Sarri succeeded Conte at Chelsea, expressing surprise at the lack of tactical organisation in the team. For now, Conte is being careful not to puff up his own club\u2019s prospects. The truth is that Inter look far from an all-conquering side despite having collected maximum points. They were grateful against Udinese to the hot-headedness of Rodrigo De Paul, sent off after 35 minutes for slapping Antonio Candreva. What the Nerazzurri do have is an emerging star in Stefano Sensi, the 24-year-old midfielder signed from Sassuolo this summer. He had already grabbed his first goal for the club in the season-opening rout of Lecce, and it was his dazzling Veronica (a pirouette turn) that drew the foul for the penalty to seal Inter\u2019s victory over Cagliari. On Saturday he added a match-winner of his own. It was a remarkable goal, Sensi beating Rodrigo Bec\u00e3o to a header despite giving up almost a foot in height . The delivery had come from Diego God\u00edn, advancing out of the back to support the attack \u2013 another positive note for the manager, who had spoken during pre-game interviews about his desire for defenders to contribute to build-up play. Sensi looks already like a classic Conte player: small in stature yet an enormous on-pitch presence, breaking the lines with his runs and committing furiously to winning back lost balls as well. He lined up in an advanced position, just behind the attack, at San Siro, yet only two players on the pitch had more touches. None had as many shots on target. Romelu Lukaku had a quieter game, but that did not prevent one pundit, Luciano Passirani, from dropping some alarming racism into the public discourse when he suggested on local TV station Telelombardia that the only way to stop the striker was to give him 10 bananas. Further awfulness was to follow, with monkey noises aimed at Franck Kessie during Milan\u2019s win away to Verona. Telelombardia were at least quick to condemn and distance themselves from Passirani\u2019s remarks, with a show director stating that he would not be invited on again. Verona took a different approach, putting out a pair of tweets in which they questioned whether the abuse of Kessie, along with reported taunts of the Milan keeper Gianluigi Donnarumma, had happened at all. \u201cThe \u2018buuu\u2019 for Kessie? The insults to Donnarumma? Maybe someone was dazed by the decibels of the Gialloblu support,\u201d read the tweets. \u201cWhat did we hear? Whistles, inevitable, for refereeing decisions that continue to leave people feeling very perplexed today, and then a lot of applause for our \u2018gladiators\u2019 at the end of the game. We will not fall into clich\u00e9s and old labels. Respect for Verona and the Veronese. #respect\u201d Unlike the league standings, those chants did not make it on to Monday\u2019s front pages. Certain stories never change. Talking points \u2022 A contrastingly beautiful scene outside the Sant\u2019Orsola hospital, with Bologna\u2019s players making a detour on their way home from beating Brescia to share the win with manager Sinisa Mihajlovic as he continues to receive treatment for leukemia. Bologna had been 2-0 down after 19 minutes, and then 3-1 down at half-time, but roared back to win 4-3 after Mihajlovic made tactical tweaks \u2013 and delivered a stern dressing down to his players \u2013 from his hospital room, relaying his instructions to his assistant Emilio De Leo. \u201cYou only come here to bust my balls when you win,\u201d he joked. \u201cBut on Wednesday we\u2019re still going to talk about your mistakes. You can come up to my room and we\u2019ll rewatch the games.\u201d For now, Bologna\u2019s seven points from three games are their best start to a Serie A season in 17 years. \u2022 A happy weekend for Duv\u00e1n Zapata, who scored a thunderous 95th-minute strike to set Atalanta off in top spirits for their Champions League debut. A less happy weekend for his cousin, Cristi\u00e1n, the Genoa defender who fouled him for the penalty that led to Atalanta\u2019s first goal and later got bamboozled by his relative in a one-on-one. \u2022 Henrikh Mkhitaryan marked his Roma debut with a goal, and Paulo Fonseca got his first win.

      "bodyText": "I once made a Channel 4 show called The Wild Gourmets. We travelled the length and breadth of the country, foraging, fishing and hunting for food, and I was allowed to cook only with what we found \u2013 plus a few sparse ingredients. It can be incredibly liberating, cutting out too much choice from the cooking equation and forcing oneself to limit the number of ingredients thrown in. Here is a midweek feast: a classic spinach and feta pie from Greece that could have more ingredients, but is totally delicious with just these. Spanakopita (spinach and feta pie) Baby spinach is too soft for this recipe, but chard would work brilliantly: use the leaves as you would the spinach, and slice the stalks into slivers, then cook them with the leeks. Prep 30 min Cook 35 min Serves 6-8 1kg whole leaf spinach Salt and pepper 4 tbsp olive oil 120g butter, melted 2 leeks, washed and finely sliced 2 eggs, beaten 325g feta, crumbled 270g filo pastry Wash the spinach, then put it in a colander and sprinkle with salt. Massage with your hands until it begins to break down and wilt, then leave to drain. Meanwhile, heat two tablespoons of oil in a pan over a medium heat, add a tablespoon of the butter, season with salt and pepper, then gently fry the leeks for five to six minutes, until soft. Take off the heat and transfer to a bowl. Squeeze the spinach again (you want it as dry as can be), then put it in a bowl with the eggs and feta. Taste and season, if needed. Pour in the remaining oil, then mix everything with your hands. Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6 and brush a medium-sized baking dish with some of the remaining butter. Line it with half the pastry, brushing more butter between each sheet and leaving any excess pastry hanging over the sides.

She enjoyed hockey, which suited her body better, but she felt written off by her PE teacher. \u201cI was like: \u2018Do you not get that I actually work really hard at the things I can do?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Now, years later, Overall is a personal trainer and sees the damage that bad PE lessons have had on her clients. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty much everybody who comes to me,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve got anybody, especially a woman, who has said: \u2018I was good at sport at school.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>It is something other trainers see, too. \u201cKids at school are not like babies and toddlers who try to crawl, fail, try to crawl, fail,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.joslynthompsonrule.com/\" title=\"\">Joslyn Thompson Rule</a>, a personal trainer. \u201cThey sense embarrassment and shame, and it\u2019s easier not to try than to try but fail. Unfortunately, it becomes a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy and leads to them not being able to do it.\u201d Teenage experience, she says, \u201ccan affect your perception of your ability\u201d.</p> <p>The things we are told as children and teenagers stay with us. I was not particularly sporty at school, although I clearly remember being praised by my PE teacher one day after a volleyball class. The idea that I am good at that one particular sport has, weirdly, become a small part of my identity \u2013 even though I have never played a game of volleyball since. Likewise, I hated cross-country running with a passion and, for years, told myself it wasn\u2019t for me, only to discover a love of running \u2013 especially over fields and hills \u2013 more than two decades later.</p> <p>\u201cKids pick up all kinds of stuff, whether or not anybody actually labels them \u2013 they make comparisons with their peers and draw conclusions,\u201d says Wendy Johnson, a professor of psychology at the University of Edinburgh. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing intrinsic to say these kinds of labels have to get wired into our identities, but sometimes they do \u2013 when kids are often last to be picked for teams or laughed at for being slow or clumsy. Things can happen along the way to reverse impressions like this, but for some kids, these identities can last a lifetime.\u201d</p> <p>All of this is not to bash PE teachers, although many adults who still hate exercise blame the teaching methods of decades ago. There is a lot of good practice out there, says Stuart Kay, schools director of the Youth Sport Trust. Schools are under immense pressure, and PE is suffering (according to research last year by the <a href=\"https://www.youthsporttrust.org/news/research-finds-whistle-being-blown-secondary-pe\" title=\"\">trust</a>, 38% of secondary schools in England have cut the time dedicated to PE for 14- to 16-year-olds since 2012).</p> <p>The stereotype of the sadistic games teacher is probably largely unfair, but, says Kay, there is \u201croom for improvement in some areas\u201d. Historically, PE lessons were \u201clargely about physical ability\u201d, he argues, but for older children it is equally important for the lessons to cover social and emotional wellbeing.</p> <p>\u201cIf you think about some of the things that turn people off sport, they\u2019re probably the same things that turn people off competition,\u201d he says. Competition can be made more inclusive beyond physical ability. \u201cWe\u2019re not trying to get rid of competition; instead, we\u2019re saying what can you do about the rules, the environment, and how are you going to decide on a winner? By reframing competition, you can make it more inclusive, and make sure that things other than sporting prowess are celebrated.\u201d</p> <p>These could include allowing everyone to play, rather than only a select few making a team, or changing the scoring so it is not only about goals or runs \u2013 the outcome of a game \u2013 but also giving scores for behaviour or skill.</p> <p>Johnson says she always told her children: \u201cExercise is good for our bodies, and everyone can find some exercise they can enjoy; it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re particularly good at it.\u201d As an adult, you can shift your identity around whether or not you are \u201csporty\u201d by simply doing it, she says. \u201cPick up any issue of Runner\u2019s World \u2013 it\u2019s full of people who have come to running in their 40s or 50s and ended up getting into it and running marathons. I don\u2019t mean winning, but they see the benefits not just of the exercise, but joining a club, where the focus is on the community rather than being the best.\u201d</p> <p>Labels such as \u201csporty\u201d have particular connotations, she says, and it is not necessarily useful to think of yourself in those terms. \u201cNot just about exercise and health, but about fashion, values, lifestyles, athleticism and sexual identity. Physical exercise that boosts physical health and psychological wellbeing comes in many forms that aren\u2019t sporty \u2013 dancing is exercise, as is gardening, carpentry and housework. If the goal is physical exercise for health, one doesn\u2019t have to have a sporty identity. Think broadly about anything that involves getting yourself moving.\u201d</p> <p>Overall rediscovered sport after enjoying aerobics classes. Hannah Lewin, a personal trainer, says many of her clients suffer from a lack of confidence around sport and exercise, usually instilled in them as teenagers. Instead of something to be enjoyed, sport became \u201ca stressful experience. An early negative experience around being shamed, or being forced to do something you weren\u2019t naturally very good at \u2013 and then belittled for not being very good at it \u2013 is something I see every day. It really does carry through into adulthood.\u201d</p> <p>Adults tend to find their way to her \u2013 and exercise \u2013 once their confidence has improved. \u201cThey may have had other successes in work or relationships,\u201d says Lewin. Overall adds: \u201cYou\u2019re now doing this for yourself. You don\u2019t have the pressure of teammates, and nobody is judging you. Don\u2019t compare yourself with anybody else. Once you find the activity that is right for you, and a situation you are comfortable in, you can be surprised at what you can do.\u201d She has had clients who have gone from sedentary lifestyles to running marathons.</p> <p>All the personal trainers I speak to say you should choose something you enjoy \u2013 this isn\u2019t about compulsory rounders any more. \u201cGyms can be daunting places and you can feel the same as an adult as you did as a child \u2013 not being good enough, fit enough, strong enough,\u201d says Thompson Rule. If being shouted at in a HIIT class isn\u2019t working for you \u2013 or brings back bad memories \u2013 do something else.</p> <p>\u201cIf you keep forcing yourself to do something you\u2019re really not enjoying, it\u2019s going to become another source of stress,\u201d says Lewin. \u201cYou\u2019ll give up and come back to that old idea of: \u2018I\u2019m not sporty.\u2019 That\u2019s not the case.

      "bodyText": "Alastair Little puts it well in the preface to his book Keep it Simple: \u201cSimple food does not necessarily mean quick food, or even easy food, though it can be both. Keeping it simple means being pure in effect \u2013 finding natural rhythms and balances, allowing the food to taste of itself.\u201d For years I had a Post-It with this quote written on it stuck to the top of my desk, until it was pulled off or lost in a move. It is an idea that makes so much sense \u2013 one at the root of so much Italian cooking (and of many other great cuisines, too). It is an idea that drags us back to the raw ingredients and asks us, the cooks, to consider them, taste them, judge them, think about how they transform and work with other ingredients, and how we can bring out the best in them. Idealising Italian food is tedious, and it is also not useful. What is to be admired, though, and therefore useful, is recognising the confident Italian ability to keep things simple and bring out the best in ingredients. Italian cooking is also chock-full of five-ingredient recipes: innumerable examples of well-honed, everyday brilliance that are as at home in the UK as in the Mediterranean \u2013 what one friend would call \u201clight bulb recipes\u201d.

Why has their relationship lasted? \u201cI think because we put each other first,\u201d says Dreux. \u201cAnd he\u2019s funny,\u201d says Dianne. \u201cWe love each other, but we really like each other.

You know how it went: friends since bonding over the Clash at school in Altrincham, Squire and Ian Brown spent much of the 80s messing with styles and lineups and everything else. They gained momentum and a following before bursting beyond Manchester with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/may/02/this-felt-like-the-sound-of-manchester-readers-on-30-years-of-the-stone-roses\">a debut that encapsulated 1989 in vinyl</a>, which often tops lists of the greatest British albums and played a significant part in the youth of a generation. Then a big gap, fighting with record companies, with each other, babies, Second Coming, mixed reviews, more fighting, accusations and allegations, fallouts and walk-outs, the end, solo projects, art \u2026 until, after an even longer gap, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/oct/18/stone-roses-reunion-comeback-gigs\">the reformation in 2012</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jun/29/stone-roses-heaton-park-review\">a tour</a>, then another end.</p> <p>Is that really it for the Roses? \u201cYeah,\u201d he says.</p> <p>How is it with Ian? They had a pact when they reformed not to talk about all that, he says. \u201cAnd I\u2019m going to honour that.\u201d</p> <p>Will he be coming to the opening of the show? \u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>Is he invited? \u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>Is anyone? \u201cI invited Mani [bassist Gary Mounfield], I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s coming.\u201d</p> <p>Squire isn\u2019t super eager to talk about the Roses. It\u2019s always the same when he is interview for a show, he says. He gets asked \u201ca couple of questions about the work, then they get down to the serious business of finding out what the scoop is on the band\u201d.</p> <p>Guilty as charged. But that\u2019s because of their extraordinary enduring appeal, and the pivotal part they played in the coming-of-age for pretty much an entire generation. How does he see it now, looking back through the filter of time? \u201cIt was quite a brief period that gets a lot of attention still,\u201d he says. \u201cI was surprised at the level of support we got when we got back on stage.\u201d</p> <p>If it sounds awkward \u2026 well it is a bit. But it\u2019s never unbearably uncomfortable. We sit down on chairs in the corner, he pours water politely. Later he apologises when he drinks straight from the bottle without thinking. Without thinking is out of character for John Squire, I think.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4b185369548520fbf3e055400eef21ef6be35487\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4b185369548520fbf3e055400eef21ef6be35487/0_415_1759_1668/1000.jpg\" alt=\"detail from The Way Things Aren\u2019t (2018).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"948\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Detail from The Way Things Aren\u2019t (2018) by John Squire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 John Squire</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be difficult,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Fifty-six and still pretty lugubrious, he often pauses before saying something or answering a question. They can be quite long pauses, but they become less and less awkward. I\u2019m not getting that Stone Roses scoop, that\u2019s clear, but the subject isn\u2019t totally off-limits \u2013 music and art have been there throughout the years after all.</p> <p>The painting came first. His mum kept a few things he did with felt tips as a kid: a polar bear, Greek soldiers, shields and spears. \u201cI didn\u2019t really become aware that art could be something enjoyed second hand until punk rock.\u201d</p> <p>Record sleeves? \u201cYeah, and clothes. The paint drips, that was a stepping-stone to abstract expressionism, then \u2018who is Jackson Pollock?\u2019, and I can use this to make my own record sleeves.\u201d Which he did, spattering Stone Roses covers with Pollock\u2019s influence.</p> <p>Squire did art A-level at college. He failed it, \u201cbecause I wasn\u2019t at all interested in the written work, the art history. This idea that museums were filled with dark religious paintings with a high-gloss finish, it made me feel depressed, reminded me of being forced to go to Sunday school.\u201d</p> <p>Mainly self-taught then, same as with the guitar, no? \u201cI did go to some lessons with a piano teacher. I took him the only sheet music I could find, which was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIfFUDt4Grw\">Rich Kids by the Rich Kids</a>. He tried to play it on the piano and it sounded nothing like the record. I think I had one lesson and realised it wasn\u2019t going to help me get anywhere. So yeah, I learnt from books.\u201d</p> <p>And became very good at it, particularly on the heavy extended riffs of Second Coming. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s flattering, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m a very good guitar player, or a very good painter. I listen to my guitar playing, my songs, I look at my paintings, I tend to focus on the faults, things that I could\u2019ve done slightly better.\u201d He points to a couple of fingers on the manipulated woman in the third panel of the triptych behind us that he\u2019s not happy with. With more time he would have made those fingers better.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4876703840a77b0f5ce4b73a09f3ce69b5392123\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4876703840a77b0f5ce4b73a09f3ce69b5392123/0_107_2832_3539/800.jpg\" alt=\"Squire beside one of his works.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Squire beside one of his works.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jill Mead/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Whether it\u2019s a song or a picture, the thrill for Squire is the initial impetus of an idea more than the finished result. With a record, \u201cthere\u2019s so much repetition \u2013 because of the recording process, mixing, mastering \u2013 the material wears thin by the time it\u2019s released.\u201d</p> <p>He doesn\u2019t listen to any of the records he\u2019s made \u2013 Stone Roses, Seahorses, his solo stuff \u2013 but he hasn\u2019t given the music up. He takes breaks from the work in the studio at his farm in Cheshire and picks up his guitar, writes songs, records songs. He doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s going to do with it; only his wife has heard them.</p> <p>Does he like working alone? \u201cYeah, I find it very therapeutic. You\u2019re not part of a committee, there is purity to that. But sometimes sharing the workload can be a rewarding experience.\u201d</p> <p>As well as the rows, it must have been a laugh as well, being in the Stone Roses. \u201cYeah, I don\u2019t spend much time laughing while I paint.\u201d</p> <p>His old band don\u2019t just live on for nostalgic fiftysomethings. Their sons \u2013 and daughters \u2013 are discovering them too. Squire\u2019s own 16-year-old daughter recently showed him a picture of her friend getting a tattoo of his own Stone Roses lemon motif. \u201cMy reaction wasn\u2019t \u2018yay!\u2019,\u201d he says. \u201cI felt guilty in a way because I knew they were the same age as Martha.\u201d</p> <p>Squire has six children, between seven and 26, some of whom have followed similar paths to their dad. His <a href=\"https://jamiesquire.co.uk/comics/\">eldest daughter</a> went to art school and now makes feminist comics. His eldest son is in a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/heavyrapids/\">band</a>. He\u2019s been to see them a few times. \u201cI should go more often, but it\u2019s too loud.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.newportstreetgallery.com/\">Disinformation</a> is at the Newport Street Gallery, London, until 10 November.<br></p></li> </ul>",

I\u2019m not getting that Stone Roses scoop, that\u2019s clear, but the subject isn\u2019t totally off-limits \u2013 music and art have been there throughout the years after all. The painting came first. His mum kept a few things he did with felt tips as a kid: a polar bear, Greek soldiers, shields and spears. \u201cI didn\u2019t really become aware that art could be something enjoyed second hand until punk rock.\u201d Record sleeves? \u201cYeah, and clothes. The paint drips, that was a stepping-stone to abstract expressionism, then \u2018who is Jackson Pollock?\u2019, and I can use this to make my own record sleeves.\u201d Which he did, spattering Stone Roses covers with Pollock\u2019s influence. Squire did art A-level at college. He failed it, \u201cbecause I wasn\u2019t at all interested in the written work, the art history. This idea that museums were filled with dark religious paintings with a high-gloss finish, it made me feel depressed, reminded me of being forced to go to Sunday school.\u201d Mainly self-taught then, same as with the guitar, no? \u201cI did go to some lessons with a piano teacher. I took him the only sheet music I could find, which was Rich Kids by the Rich Kids. He tried to play it on the piano and it sounded nothing like the record. I think I had one lesson and realised it wasn\u2019t going to help me get anywhere. So yeah, I learnt from books.\u201d And became very good at it, particularly on the heavy extended riffs of Second Coming. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s flattering, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m a very good guitar player, or a very good painter. I listen to my guitar playing, my songs, I look at my paintings, I tend to focus on the faults, things that I could\u2019ve done slightly better.\u201d He points to a couple of fingers on the manipulated woman in the third panel of the triptych behind us that he\u2019s not happy with. With more time he would have made those fingers better. Whether it\u2019s a song or a picture, the thrill for Squire is the initial impetus of an idea more than the finished result. With a record, \u201cthere\u2019s so much repetition \u2013 because of the recording process, mixing, mastering \u2013 the material wears thin by the time it\u2019s released.\u201d He doesn\u2019t listen to any of the records he\u2019s made \u2013 Stone Roses, Seahorses, his solo stuff \u2013 but he hasn\u2019t given the music up. He takes breaks from the work in the studio at his farm in Cheshire and picks up his guitar, writes songs, records songs. He doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s going to do with it; only his wife has heard them. Does he like working alone? \u201cYeah, I find it very therapeutic. You\u2019re not part of a committee, there is purity to that. But sometimes sharing the workload can be a rewarding experience.\u201d As well as the rows, it must have been a laugh as well, being in the Stone Roses. \u201cYeah, I don\u2019t spend much time laughing while I paint.\u201d His old band don\u2019t just live on for nostalgic fiftysomethings. Their sons \u2013 and daughters \u2013 are discovering them too. Squire\u2019s own 16-year-old daughter recently showed him a picture of her friend getting a tattoo of his own Stone Roses lemon motif. \u201cMy reaction wasn\u2019t \u2018yay!\u2019,\u201d he says. \u201cI felt guilty in a way because I knew they were the same age as Martha.\u201d Squire has six children, between seven and 26, some of whom have followed similar paths to their dad. His eldest daughter went to art school and now makes feminist comics. His eldest son is in a band. He\u2019s been to see them a few times. \u201cI should go more often, but it\u2019s too loud.\u201d Disinformation is at the Newport Street Gallery, London, until 10 November.",

An alternative idea involves only Northern Ireland staying in the EU\u2019s customs territory. That would place a customs border in the Irish Sea.

      "bodyText": "After decades in the wings, antisemitism is center stage all over the western world. What\u2019s more, some of the same leaders who terrify Jews at home loudly proclaim devotion to the Jewish state in the Middle East, to the seeming delight of the current government in Jerusalem. What is going on? Bari Weiss, columnist and editor at the New York Times, has some ideas. Her childhood synagogue in Pittsburgh was the site of last year\u2019s Shabbat morning massacre. This passionate, vividly written, regularly insightful book is her pained, fighting elegy. Loosely written, going not deep but wide, she brings together trends whose crisscrossing makes for much current confusion. And her observations generally ring true. Her taking aim at both right and left will infuriate some but is on the mark. What, for Weiss, is antisemitism? \u201cAn ever-morphing conspiracy theory in which Jews play the starring role in spreading evil in the world.\u201d What\u2019s more, Weiss notes, antisemitism \u201cturns Jews into the symbol of whatever a given civilization defines as its most sinister and threatening qualities\u201d \u2013 be it atheism, fundamentalism, cosmopolitanism, tribalism or all of them at once. Yes, Jews can be found among all those camps and more. But the antisemitic move is to tie them all together and thus explain everything. This monomaniacal vision doesn\u2019t just wound Jews. \u201cIf you examine societies that have embraced antisemitism,\u201d Weiss writes, \u201cyou will see that they have gone mad because they have substituted a conspiracy theory for reality.\u201d Enter today\u2019s conspiracist-in-chief.

We may yet see, as previewed in Trump\u2019s retweet about his being the new \u201cKing of Israel\u201d, a new antisemitic claim: the Jews have once again spurned their own savior, not the son of God this time but one with an Orthodox son-in-law, and so will have gotten what they deserve. On the left, the UK\u2019s Corbynites and some Americans have found themselves unable to draw a line between fairly criticizing the Jewish state and demonizing it, along with, by implication, Jews who fail to disavow it.

      "bodyText": "The Fijian prime minister, Frank Bainimarama, has called on Australia to be \u201cfar more ambitious\u201d in reducing greenhouse gases, linking the climate crisis to extreme weather events in the Pacific including drought and bushfires in Australia. On the final official day of his visit to Australia, Bainimarama nominated the \u201cvaried level of ambition when it comes to confronting the threat of climate change\u201d as a key difference between the two countries and called for everyone to \u201cunite behind the science\u201d of limiting global heating to 1.5C. Bainimarama\u2019s visit follows his heavy criticism of Scott Morrison at the Pacific Islands Forum, where he said the Australian prime minister had insulted and alienated Pacific leaders over his failure to back stronger emissions targets. In a speech at the Australian War College in Canberra, Bainimarama said Fiji was seeking \u201ccommon ground\u201d with Australia, praising the two countries\u2019 shared values and thanking Australia for its support in the aftermath of cyclone Winston. But Bainimarama said that nations \u2013 as with families \u2013 \u201conly thrive when those living under the same roof are considerate of each other\u201d, acting \u201cin the collective interest of the household and not just their own\u201d.

He said the \u201csteady deterioration in the state of the only planet we have\u201d means that all nations need to be more ambitious in cutting greenhouse gas emissions. \u201cWe must all unite behind the science and the IPCC report that calls for the average global temperature to be capped at 1.5C above that of the pre-industrial age.\u201d Bainimarama called on Australia to \u201cjoin us in stepping up our collective response to the climate threat\u201d, including by putting the IPCC report back on the agenda at COP25 in Chile in December. \u201cFiji and the other Pacific nations have already declared a crisis in our own region in the Kainaki II Declaration arising from last month\u2019s meeting of the Pacific Islands Forum in Tuvalu. \u201cThis was the strongest declaration from the PIF on climate and we appreciate Australia\u2019s support as a signatory to the declaration.\u201d Bainimarama suggested Australia could also help Fiji with renewable energy research, development and investment, reduce dependency on fossil fuels and increase carbon stocks through better management of landscapes and soils. Guardian Australia reported last week that Morrison will not attend the upcoming UN climate action summit despite him being in America to visit the Trump administration at the time \u2013 sending the foreign minister, Marise Payne, instead \u2013 because speaking slots were reserved for countries announcing new emissions reduction targets or financial commitments to the UN Green Climate Fund.

      "bodyText": "The Morrison government\u2019s backbench economics committee has signed off on the long telegraphed \u201cbig stick\u201d package but MPs, already uncomfortable about the proposal, have expressed reservations about how it might be amended in the Senate. The package, which contains a power to break up big energy companies if they engage in price gouging, will go to the Coalition party room for approval on Tuesday. In an effort to quell internal and external doubts about the package, the government will sunset the legislation in 2026, and amend the proposal introduced and shelved during the previous parliament to ensure any forced divestiture cannot result in the privatisation of state-owned energy assets. The government has now inserted a number of procedural steps to be undertaken before a divestiture can be ordered. While the changes have mollified some Liberals discomfited about the principle of breaking up big companies, Nationals who have pursued the package vigorously both before and after the May election could have objections about the sunsetting and the additional procedural hurdles in the revised package. Guardian Australia understands concerns were expressed during the backbench committee meeting on Monday morning about potential Senate amendments that would alter the package as it currently stands.

MPs are concerned that too often amendments are added because of negotiations with the crossbench by the government Senate leadership, and the changes are never referred back to the backbench committee for approval. Guardian Australia understands that to address the anxiety, Frydenberg gave an undertaking to bring the package back to the committee for a second approval if there were substantial amendments added during parliamentary debate.

      "body": "<p>Andie MacDowell\u2019s career as a successful model, who went on to become a successful actor, almost ended before it began. It was 1979, in the middle of the Studio 54 era, when she moved to New York. She was 21 years old, had just been signed by the Elite model agency and appeared to have the world at her feet. But she soon wanted to go back to her home town. \u201cThere was a lot of cocaine around,\u201d she says. \u201cI had a small experience at the very beginning and hated it. I hated it! It was only, like, a month. I really didn\u2019t like the way it felt. It didn\u2019t make me feel good and I couldn\u2019t sleep. I actually went into my agency and said I wanted to go home, and they said: \u2018You need new friends. You\u2019re around the wrong people.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Who was she hanging out with? \u201cI don\u2019t even remember, honestly,\u201d she says. \u201cI wasn\u2019t around famous people at that point. It was not what I intended to do.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2013/jul/24/john-casablancas\" title=\"\">John Casablancas</a>, the founder of Elite, flew with her to Paris, \u201cand this young man showed up at the agency who didn\u2019t drink, smoke or do drugs, and it was like, I had a boyfriend.\u201d</p> <p>The young man was Olivier Chandon de Brailles, the heir to Mo\u00ebt &amp; Chandon. \u201cI don\u2019t know if they prearranged the whole thing, but it sure did work out well for me. I started working non-stop and my whole life opened up. I was about to go home for a few seconds there.\u201d She pauses. \u201cI\u2019ve never told anybody that story so please don\u2019t make it sound like I was a big druggy because I really wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>I meet MacDowell at her house, a secluded Spanish-style property that is modest by Hollywood Hills standards and homely, with a \u201cHello\u201d doormat. A tiny rescue dog called Ava Gardner is sunning herself on the terrace. Next door is a building site, which MacDowell apologises for. A house is being built, she says, for her daughters, Margaret, 24, and Rainey Qualley, 29, who have followed her into the movie business.</p> <p>Margaret is the breakout star of Quentin Tarantino\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/aug/18/once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-review-quentin-tarantino-leonardo-dicaprio-brad-pitt\" title=\"\">Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</a>, playing one of Charles Manson\u2019s followers. The day before I meet her mother, she has been nominated for an Emmy for her supporting role in the TV show Fosse/Verdon. MacDowell was in her car when she heard the news. \u201cI was having a hard time driving, I was so excited,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m trying to figure out where I\u2019m going, but I\u2019m crying; I was really having to focus.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1525bacc10cc6dd44f50043a2919fcf0c0ec1d93\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1525bacc10cc6dd44f50043a2919fcf0c0ec1d93/0_0_3392_2266/1000.jpg\" alt=\"MacDowell with Bill Murray in Groundhog Day.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">MacDowell with Bill Murray in Groundhog Day.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Moviestore/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is almost 30 years since MacDowell received her first big industry nod for her acting \u2013 a Golden Globe nomination for Steven Soderbergh\u2019s acclaimed indie film Sex, Lies and Videotape. There were more nominations for the romcoms <a href=\"https://www.goldenglobes.com/film/green-card\" title=\"\">Green Card (in 1991)</a> and <a href=\"https://www.goldenglobes.com/film/four-weddings-and-funeral\" title=\"\">Four Weddings and a Funeral (in 1995)</a>, and she had success, too, with the 1993 comedy Groundhog Day. Now 61, MacDowell has continued to work consistently, while spending much of the past 20 years bringing up her daughters and their older brother, Justin, in North Carolina, after divorcing their father, Paul Qualley, in 1999.</p> <p>She grew up in Gaffney, South Carolina, not too far from where she raised her own kids, and her deep resistance to drugs and alcohol can be attributed to her upbringing. Her mother was an alcoholic and the role of carer fell to MacDowell, the youngest of four siblings. She and her mother, \u201chad a great relationship and I always felt loved,\u201d she says. \u201cThere was this old-fashioned can opener attached to the wall and she\u2019d be in the kitchen drinking and I\u2019d clean the oil off the can opener and talk to her and ask: \u2018Why do you drink?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>When she was 10, she would get up in the middle of the night to check that her mother\u2019s cigarettes were stubbed out properly. \u201cThere were burn marks all over the floor and on the couch; it\u2019s amazing we didn\u2019t burn down,\u201d she says. That\u2019s a lot of responsibility for a child, I say. \u201cI think I\u2019ve felt responsible all my life. But I\u2019m good at it. I\u2019ve been in training for a long time.\u201d</p> <p>At 16, she was working in McDonald\u2019s alongside her mother, a former music teacher, and watched her get fired for turning up drunk. At 17, she involved doctors to try to help her mother overcome her alcoholism, which failed when one of them gave her mother Valium. \u201cThat was a bad decision because then I couldn\u2019t communicate with her. And I communicated really well with her. We could have committed her; we just didn\u2019t have the guts. The doctor told us she would die in five years. The strange thing is, she did.\u201d</p> <p>MacDowell was living in Paris when her mother died of a heart attack, and clings to a letter she received from her. \u201cShe said she had quit drinking and that she was so proud of me,\u201d she says. \u201cThat was the last year of her life and I didn\u2019t really get to be around it, which was super sad. I think about going back to Gaffney. I\u2019d like to go back and try to find out from other people what that year that I didn\u2019t get to experience was like.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0585f437399c6aefcf2371b706cf3992af923a32\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0585f437399c6aefcf2371b706cf3992af923a32/0_0_2682_3176/844.jpg\" alt=\"MacDowell with Hugh Grant in Four Weddings and a Funeral.\" width=\"844\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">MacDowell with Hugh Grant in Four Weddings and a Funeral.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Polygram/Working Title/Kobal/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She is a big advocate of therapy, which helps, although she is not having any currently. \u201cI feel like everything is going really well for me right now,\u201d she says. \u201cThe last therapist I had \u2013 I felt like I\u2019d done so much therapy \u2013 I was like: \u2018She\u2019s already diagnosing me and we\u2019ve only had two conversations.\u2019 You have to listen a little longer before you start telling me what\u2019s wrong!\u201d</p> <p>Her latest role, in the comedy-horror <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/aug/20/ready-or-not-review-scrappy-comedy-horror-is-all-bark-and-no-bite\" title=\"\">Ready or Not</a>, is fun; she plays the glamorous matriarch of a rich, ridiculous family who embark on a deadly game of hide and seek to \u201cinitiate\u201d their son\u2019s new wife into the firm.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t really know what I was getting into,\u201d she shrugs. Yet, with generally positive reviews and a supposedly handsome box-office return, it looks set to become one of the year\u2019s unexpected success stories in the horror genre. It is directed by Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett. She says she liked the fact that \u201cthey were young guys and they\u2019re weird; their energy was different from anything I\u2019ve ever experienced.</p> <p>\u201cI thought it was really smart and original, but scary and gory as well,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s some classic horror movie stuff, but then all these great lines.\u201d</p> <p>MacDowell adopted a big fake glossy ponytail to make her character, Becky Le Domas, \u201clook a bit crazier and more powerful\u201d. It is reminiscent of the eccentric Aunt Ivy she played in the latest series of the bizarre British sitcom Cuckoo, earlier this year.</p> <p>While the roles she has played most recently are entertaining \u2013 and show off her sense of humour \u2013 they do not showcase the full range of her talent. By comparison, her depiction of a grieving widow in 2017\u2019s Love After Love was so raw that critics compared it to her Sex, Lies and Videotape breakthrough. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you watched it,\u201d she replies. \u201cNot as many people have seen it as I would have liked.\u201d</p> <p>She is baffled by this. \u201cIs it my fault it\u2019s not a huge hit? I still did great work, you know. You\u2019re probably seeing better work in that than in Four Weddings. But it\u2019s not a hit, so \u2026 therein is the problem, because everyone is looking for a hit. If you don\u2019t have hits, you don\u2019t resonate as well within the business. Interestingly, very few people have blockbusters. But once you\u2019ve had blockbusters, you\u2019re expected to have blockbusters.\u201d</p> <p>When Love After Love was released, MacDowell described herself as \u201cstarving\u201d for the role. \u201cThere was just a lack of interesting characters,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019ve heard every woman say it, because it\u2019s the truth. We\u2019re a very youth-oriented culture. In most movies, the leads are in their 30s and a great leading role for a mature woman is hard to come by. I have felt lulls. Since I was 40, I have felt particular lulls! I\u2019ve been struggling since I was 40.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtYTwUxhAoI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZtYTwUxhAoI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption> </figcaption> </figure>   <p>That was the year people started asking her how it felt to have reached an age where she would never work again. \u201cEveryone said everything was going to change at 40 \u2013 and it was true,\u201d she says. \u201cI did some shitty movies that I\u2019ve never even seen!\u201d She cites Town &amp; Country (2001), one of the biggest box office flops in Hollywood history, as an example.</p> <p>How did she cope with no longer having her pick of roles? \u201cI kept trying to be positive. I didn\u2019t want to be a whiner because I knew that men were in control and I didn\u2019t want it to be harder than it already was. I knew if you spoke out and whined, they hated you. So I just tried to project this positive attitude. Even in the back of my mind, I\u2019m still trying to please them, because they\u2019re in control.\u201d</p> <p>The month before we met, she heard a male actor (\u201cI\u2019m not going to say who\u201d) say: \u201cPeople go to movies to see men, not women.\u201d Did she challenge him? \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel like I was going to change him,\u201d she sighs. \u201cThere are a lot of people [in Hollywood] that still push that way of thinking. That is what they think. They\u2019re going to continue to think it. They\u2019re going to continue to push it. Even if a story is about a woman, they\u2019ll cast the male lead first because they believe people do not care about seeing women. Even women, they\u2019ll say that women and men go to the movies to see men.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"91dffa8c10e78416ecc285c0f8f3b256738a9023\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/91dffa8c10e78416ecc285c0f8f3b256738a9023/0_0_3498_3498/1000.jpg\" alt=\"MacDowell as the eccentric Aunt Ivy in the British sitcom Cuckoo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">MacDowell as the eccentric Aunt Ivy in the British sitcom Cuckoo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/Rough Cut</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt sucks the air out of you. It hurts, not just for me, but for every woman, that this is our position still.\u201d She is heartened by the Time\u2019s Up movement, and the attitudes she sees in women her daughters\u2019 age. \u201cThe younger generation are not like my generation. We were well trained to be \u2018less than\u2019. We had a certain acceptance of our position that the younger generation is not going to tolerate; the wherewithal to teach them they deserve better and they\u2019re not gonna settle for less. I know my kids won\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>I ask if she had any reservations about her daughters getting into the movie business, knowing from her own experience what lay ahead. \u201cIt\u2019s funny; everyone says that like there\u2019s some fear of being in this business, but it\u2019s actually a really good business. I just didn\u2019t want them to do it as children. Rainey was asking me at 14. I was like: \u2018At 18, if you want to, you can.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cLife can be crazy in any profession. When there\u2019s a lot of money, there\u2019s more opportunity to be crazy, but that\u2019s not my lifestyle and it\u2019s not their lifestyle either. We\u2019re really kind of boring people.

      "bodyText": "Andie MacDowell\u2019s career as a successful model, who went on to become a successful actor, almost ended before it began. It was 1979, in the middle of the Studio 54 era, when she moved to New York. She was 21 years old, had just been signed by the Elite model agency and appeared to have the world at her feet. But she soon wanted to go back to her home town. \u201cThere was a lot of cocaine around,\u201d she says. \u201cI had a small experience at the very beginning and hated it. I hated it! It was only, like, a month. I really didn\u2019t like the way it felt. It didn\u2019t make me feel good and I couldn\u2019t sleep. I actually went into my agency and said I wanted to go home, and they said: \u2018You need new friends. You\u2019re around the wrong people.\u2019\u201d Who was she hanging out with? \u201cI don\u2019t even remember, honestly,\u201d she says. \u201cI wasn\u2019t around famous people at that point. It was not what I intended to do.\u201d John Casablancas, the founder of Elite, flew with her to Paris, \u201cand this young man showed up at the agency who didn\u2019t drink, smoke or do drugs, and it was like, I had a boyfriend.\u201d The young man was Olivier Chandon de Brailles, the heir to Mo\u00ebt &amp; Chandon. \u201cI don\u2019t know if they prearranged the whole thing, but it sure did work out well for me. I started working non-stop and my whole life opened up. I was about to go home for a few seconds there.\u201d She pauses. \u201cI\u2019ve never told anybody that story so please don\u2019t make it sound like I was a big druggy because I really wasn\u2019t.\u201d I meet MacDowell at her house, a secluded Spanish-style property that is modest by Hollywood Hills standards and homely, with a \u201cHello\u201d doormat. A tiny rescue dog called Ava Gardner is sunning herself on the terrace. Next door is a building site, which MacDowell apologises for. A house is being built, she says, for her daughters, Margaret, 24, and Rainey Qualley, 29, who have followed her into the movie business. Margaret is the breakout star of Quentin Tarantino\u2019s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, playing one of Charles Manson\u2019s followers. The day before I meet her mother, she has been nominated for an Emmy for her supporting role in the TV show Fosse/Verdon. MacDowell was in her car when she heard the news. \u201cI was having a hard time driving, I was so excited,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m trying to figure out where I\u2019m going, but I\u2019m crying; I was really having to focus.\u201d It is almost 30 years since MacDowell received her first big industry nod for her acting \u2013 a Golden Globe nomination for Steven Soderbergh\u2019s acclaimed indie film Sex, Lies and Videotape. There were more nominations for the romcoms Green Card (in 1991) and Four Weddings and a Funeral (in 1995), and she had success, too, with the 1993 comedy Groundhog Day. Now 61, MacDowell has continued to work consistently, while spending much of the past 20 years bringing up her daughters and their older brother, Justin, in North Carolina, after divorcing their father, Paul Qualley, in 1999. She grew up in Gaffney, South Carolina, not too far from where she raised her own kids, and her deep resistance to drugs and alcohol can be attributed to her upbringing. Her mother was an alcoholic and the role of carer fell to MacDowell, the youngest of four siblings. She and her mother, \u201chad a great relationship and I always felt loved,\u201d she says. \u201cThere was this old-fashioned can opener attached to the wall and she\u2019d be in the kitchen drinking and I\u2019d clean the oil off the can opener and talk to her and ask: \u2018Why do you drink?\u2019\u201d When she was 10, she would get up in the middle of the night to check that her mother\u2019s cigarettes were stubbed out properly. \u201cThere were burn marks all over the floor and on the couch; it\u2019s amazing we didn\u2019t burn down,\u201d she says. That\u2019s a lot of responsibility for a child, I say. \u201cI think I\u2019ve felt responsible all my life. But I\u2019m good at it. I\u2019ve been in training for a long time.\u201d At 16, she was working in McDonald\u2019s alongside her mother, a former music teacher, and watched her get fired for turning up drunk. At 17, she involved doctors to try to help her mother overcome her alcoholism, which failed when one of them gave her mother Valium. \u201cThat was a bad decision because then I couldn\u2019t communicate with her. And I communicated really well with her. We could have committed her; we just didn\u2019t have the guts. The doctor told us she would die in five years. The strange thing is, she did.\u201d MacDowell was living in Paris when her mother died of a heart attack, and clings to a letter she received from her. \u201cShe said she had quit drinking and that she was so proud of me,\u201d she says. \u201cThat was the last year of her life and I didn\u2019t really get to be around it, which was super sad. I think about going back to Gaffney. I\u2019d like to go back and try to find out from other people what that year that I didn\u2019t get to experience was like.\u201d She is a big advocate of therapy, which helps, although she is not having any currently. \u201cI feel like everything is going really well for me right now,\u201d she says. \u201cThe last therapist I had \u2013 I felt like I\u2019d done so much therapy \u2013 I was like: \u2018She\u2019s already diagnosing me and we\u2019ve only had two conversations.\u2019 You have to listen a little longer before you start telling me what\u2019s wrong!\u201d Her latest role, in the comedy-horror Ready or Not, is fun; she plays the glamorous matriarch of a rich, ridiculous family who embark on a deadly game of hide and seek to \u201cinitiate\u201d their son\u2019s new wife into the firm. \u201cI didn\u2019t really know what I was getting into,\u201d she shrugs. Yet, with generally positive reviews and a supposedly handsome box-office return, it looks set to become one of the year\u2019s unexpected success stories in the horror genre. It is directed by Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett. She says she liked the fact that \u201cthey were young guys and they\u2019re weird; their energy was different from anything I\u2019ve ever experienced. \u201cI thought it was really smart and original, but scary and gory as well,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s some classic horror movie stuff, but then all these great lines.\u201d MacDowell adopted a big fake glossy ponytail to make her character, Becky Le Domas, \u201clook a bit crazier and more powerful\u201d. It is reminiscent of the eccentric Aunt Ivy she played in the latest series of the bizarre British sitcom Cuckoo, earlier this year. While the roles she has played most recently are entertaining \u2013 and show off her sense of humour \u2013 they do not showcase the full range of her talent. By comparison, her depiction of a grieving widow in 2017\u2019s Love After Love was so raw that critics compared it to her Sex, Lies and Videotape breakthrough. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you watched it,\u201d she replies. \u201cNot as many people have seen it as I would have liked.\u201d She is baffled by this. \u201cIs it my fault it\u2019s not a huge hit? I still did great work, you know. You\u2019re probably seeing better work in that than in Four Weddings. But it\u2019s not a hit, so \u2026 therein is the problem, because everyone is looking for a hit. If you don\u2019t have hits, you don\u2019t resonate as well within the business. Interestingly, very few people have blockbusters. But once you\u2019ve had blockbusters, you\u2019re expected to have blockbusters.\u201d When Love After Love was released, MacDowell described herself as \u201cstarving\u201d for the role. \u201cThere was just a lack of interesting characters,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019ve heard every woman say it, because it\u2019s the truth. We\u2019re a very youth-oriented culture. In most movies, the leads are in their 30s and a great leading role for a mature woman is hard to come by. I have felt lulls. Since I was 40, I have felt particular lulls! I\u2019ve been struggling since I was 40.\u201d That was the year people started asking her how it felt to have reached an age where she would never work again. \u201cEveryone said everything was going to change at 40 \u2013 and it was true,\u201d she says. \u201cI did some shitty movies that I\u2019ve never even seen!\u201d She cites Town &amp; Country (2001), one of the biggest box office flops in Hollywood history, as an example. How did she cope with no longer having her pick of roles? \u201cI kept trying to be positive. I didn\u2019t want to be a whiner because I knew that men were in control and I didn\u2019t want it to be harder than it already was. I knew if you spoke out and whined, they hated you. So I just tried to project this positive attitude. Even in the back of my mind, I\u2019m still trying to please them, because they\u2019re in control.\u201d The month before we met, she heard a male actor (\u201cI\u2019m not going to say who\u201d) say: \u201cPeople go to movies to see men, not women.\u201d Did she challenge him? \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel like I was going to change him,\u201d she sighs. \u201cThere are a lot of people [in Hollywood] that still push that way of thinking. That is what they think. They\u2019re going to continue to think it. They\u2019re going to continue to push it. Even if a story is about a woman, they\u2019ll cast the male lead first because they believe people do not care about seeing women. Even women, they\u2019ll say that women and men go to the movies to see men. \u201cIt sucks the air out of you. It hurts, not just for me, but for every woman, that this is our position still.\u201d She is heartened by the Time\u2019s Up movement, and the attitudes she sees in women her daughters\u2019 age. \u201cThe younger generation are not like my generation. We were well trained to be \u2018less than\u2019. We had a certain acceptance of our position that the younger generation is not going to tolerate; the wherewithal to teach them they deserve better and they\u2019re not gonna settle for less. I know my kids won\u2019t.\u201d I ask if she had any reservations about her daughters getting into the movie business, knowing from her own experience what lay ahead. \u201cIt\u2019s funny; everyone says that like there\u2019s some fear of being in this business, but it\u2019s actually a really good business. I just didn\u2019t want them to do it as children. Rainey was asking me at 14. I was like: \u2018At 18, if you want to, you can.\u2019 \u201cLife can be crazy in any profession. When there\u2019s a lot of money, there\u2019s more opportunity to be crazy, but that\u2019s not my lifestyle and it\u2019s not their lifestyle either. We\u2019re really kind of boring people. We barely want to go out ... I\u2019m a home body and I do yoga and I hike, that\u2019s kind of it. No drugs and rock and roll!\u201d She moved to California to be near her daughters in 2017, and says she had no idea how much she would enjoy it. For all the struggles women in Hollywood have when they pass 40, she is clearly realistic and healthy, appropriately optimistic. \u201cEveryone has their own journey,\u201d she says. \u201cMaybe something fabulous is going to happen for me at 70.\u201d \u2022 Ready or Not is in UK cinemas from 25 September",

His notifications are turned off. This transforms social media into \u201csomething you visit. You don\u2019t let it visit you.\u201d</p> <p>There are apps, of course, such as Forest, Freedom and Moment, that limit the time any user spends on social media. Ad\u00e9b\u00e1y\u00f2, like Haig, has found Freedom useful. She is working on her second novel, and after three weeks of downloading Freedom to limit her Twitter use, she found she could write without it. But even so, on social media she veers between \u201cbinge\u201d and \u201ccold turkey\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cEarlier this year with Instagram it was that way. It wasn\u2019t even that I was posting anything, I was going down this rabbit hole\u201d \u2013 food on Instagram, Nigerian politics on Twitter. \u201cI haven\u2019t found a way to use the mediums and still be reasonably productive,\u201d Ad\u00e9b\u00e1y\u00f2 says. This is why the phone with all the apps on it lives in the wardrobe.</p> <p>Sometimes she rewards herself: write four chapters, and you can go on Instagram.</p> <p>\u201cIf I log in, I can spend two hours going from one picture to another. And then what I do is delete the app.\u201d Then, quite often, what she does is discover herself in the process of reinstalling the app. \u201cI am very invested in the idea of being responsible and self-controlled. But even the fact that I have to put the phone in the wardrobe is mortifying for me. Why can\u2019t I just not look at it? Shame is attached to it actually.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6515e9089d31550db9a73621ca996cc21558f7e1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6515e9089d31550db9a73621ca996cc21558f7e1/31_553_3726_2236/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Danez Smith\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018My Mum would be on Facebook and I\u2019d be on Twitter \u2013 I have been interested in how to train myself out of that.\u2019 \u2026 Danez Smith.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Saker/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe have to have some willpower to control how we dip and dive into that space,\u201d the poet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/28/danez-smith-interview-poetry-dont-call-us-dead-dear-white-america\">Danez Smith</a> agrees. \u201cThat is why the last couple of years I have taken steps to figure out how to put a handle on how much time I spend on social media.\u201d</p> <p>Smith, who uses the pronoun they, felt their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/mar/18/social-media-addiction-should-be-seen-as-disease-mps-say\">social media use had become addictive</a>. \u201cI love my mum but we\u2019d be sitting together and she\u2019d be on Facebook and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Danez_Smif?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">I\u2019d be on Twitter</a> \u2026 I have been interested in how to train myself out of that.\u201d</p> <p>First, Smith blocked social media altogether on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays \u2013 \u201ca little game that me and my therapist came up with\u201d. Putting on a really long playlist also circumvented phone use. And Smith used Forest, which allows a user to decide their period of inactivity on their phone, and \u201cgrow\u201d a virtual tree in the fallow time. (It dies if you use your phone early: no one wants to kill a tree with a lack of willpower.) But Smith believes that such apps really function as a way \u201cto access my own willpower\u201d. Now Smith and their mum act as checks on each other. \u201cWe put our phones in the other room.\u201d If one of them breaks curfew, \u201cwe\u2019ll both call it out\u201d.</p> <p>For writers who write alone, relying on a companion to stay focused on the right screen is out of the question. And for those who do have a human to rebuke them when they fall off the wagon, this sort of company can be a double-edged sword. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/dec/12/attrib-this-eley-williamss-experimental-stories-are-a-microblast\" title=\"\">Eley Williams</a>, whose short story collection <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/01/attrib-and-other-stories-by-eley-williams-review\">Attrib</a></em> won the Republic of Consciousness and James Tait Black prizes for fiction last year, sometimes writes in the same room as her partner, the author Nell Stevens. \u201cAnd whenever we write in the same room, we keep glancing when one reaches for the phone, policing the other one while wanting to reach for our own phone, and managing that guilt.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Every 15 minutes I find I am looking at Twitter \u2013 if you are writing on your own, you want some kind of chatter</p> <footer> <cite>Eley Williams</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The glancing is \u201cin one way a regulatory thing\u201d, Williams says. But it is also makes it hard to put her own phone out of mind. Hiding the phone in the wardrobe as Ad\u00e9b\u00e1y\u00f2 does \u2013 or throwing it from the desk on to the bed as I like to do \u2013 would make it harder to write, Williams thinks. The phone\u2019s absence \u201cwould be weighing heavily on my mind\u201d, while apps such as Forest or Freedom \u201cwould make me fetishise the idea that pleasure was being deferred \u2013 that Twitter was almost there, but beyond my grasp\u201d, and that, she feels, would be the story of the day.</p> <p>So <a href=\"https://twitter.com/giantratsumatra?lang=en\">instead, she writes, and every so often she looks at Twitter</a>. But how often? Every hour? Every 20 minutes? \u201cKeep going!\u201d Williams says, laughing. \u201cProbably every 15 minutes I will find that I am looking at it. There is an element of \u201csafety blanket\u201d. If you are writing on your own, you want some kind of chatter, even ignorable chatter, going on. You need to feel that you could be distracted, just to make your day feel anchored in a real social setting.\u201d</p> <p>What Williams describes \u2013 the frequent, brief sideways look at social media \u2013 is as much a touchstone of the writing life as staring out of the window or at fingernails. Joanne Harris runs a blog, a public <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/JoanneHarrisAuthor/\" title=\"\">Facebook</a> page and uses <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/joannechocolat/?hl=en\" title=\"\">Instagram</a>, but it is on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Joannechocolat\" title=\"\">Twitter</a> where she really spends her social media time (she has tweeted 131,000 times, 50,000 more than Haig, who considers his tally high). She used to be a teacher, and glancing at Twitter is \u201cthe equivalent of popping into the staffroom, grabbing a cup of tea and reading half a page of the newspaper\u201d. Harris uses social media \u201cif I want a break or I want to look something up or\u201d \u2013 and this is a reflex many writers will relate to \u2013 \u201cif I\u2019m just thinking of the end of a sentence and the words won\u2019t come\u201d.</p> <p>Is it detrimental to look at Twitter in those moments of suspended attention or drift? <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/sep/30/fiona-mozley-elmet-my-writing-day\">Fiona Mozley</a> finds it so. When her debut novel <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/aug/09/elmet-fiona-mozley-review\" title=\"\">Elmet</a></em> was shortlisted for the Booker prize in 2017, Twitter became a less comfortable place to spend time. She noticed that the little glance at Twitter would happen whenever she looked up from her writing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a24e1723a74830ce1aa22fef05de597c16483592\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a24e1723a74830ce1aa22fef05de597c16483592/329_510_5152_3091/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joyce Carol Oate\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I don\u2019t find social media a temptation \u2013 I suppose I\u2019m more interested in my work\u2019 \u2026 Joyce Carol Oates.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe point at which you pause is a really important moment,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s supposed to be when you\u2019re thinking \u2013 about what you\u2019re writing or going to write.\u201d But that little empty space for creation, the blank awaiting a word or a thought, would be filled instead with strings of tweets. She tried writing with a pen to avoid the screen. And then last autumn she deactivated her account to finish her second novel. (She\u2019s back now.)</p> <p>Mozley\u2019s distrust of the usurped pause, her worry about what might be lost in the glance at the wrong screen, makes perfect sense. But the pause works differently for different writers (and sometimes for the same writer at different times).</p> <p>\u201cIf you mean: do I feel I am clicking on Twitter when I should be doing something else? Yes, absolutely,\u201d says <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Harkaway?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Nick Harkaway</a>, who also operates accounts on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/harkaway/\" title=\"\">Instagram</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/nickharkaway/\" title=\"\">Facebook</a> and <a href=\"http://harkaway.tumblr.com/\" title=\"\">Tumblr</a>, with \u201clittle pipes that run from one to the other\u201d, pushing content between his platforms. \u201cWhen I feel that way, I just switch it off. Dump it. It\u2019s not some kind of mad Heath Robinson machine, which will poke you awake in the night. It is individual beings. Negotiating how to communicate with them through social media is just another aspect of being alive today.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Twitter can give a buzz and a boost and a filip when you are struggling with a sentence, paragraph or book</p> <footer> <cite>Robert Macfarlane</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For Harkaway, the misspent pause can be beneficial. \u201cThere\u2019s a kind of waiting state,\u201d he says, \u201ca preparatory state that your brain needs to drop into before you do the hard work. It\u2019s a really good idea to take five minutes and not to worry. Now, does Twitter work like that? Potentially. It\u2019s a bunch of white noise, snowflake imagery, then you go: \u2018Right. Now to work.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Anyhow, he says, in the case of any interruption, \u201cYou can never tell what you are losing and gaining. Without the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/mar/07/hilary-mantel\">person from Porlock</a>, would the second half [of \u201cKubla Khan\u201d] have been atrocious? Because quite a lot of [Coleridge\u2019s] poetry would have been better if someone had come and interrupted him.\u201d Harkaway thinks he mostly succumbs to distractions when his work is going badly.</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/JoyceCarolOates\" title=\"\">Joyce Carol Oates</a>, another prolific tweeter, agrees with this. \u201cI don\u2019t find social media a particular temptation,\u201d she replies. \u201cI suppose that I am more interested in my work \u2026 \u201d</p> <p>And while some writers find that social media distracts from writing \u2013 Danez Smith has become \u201cmore productive in my poetry, more active in my reading\u201d since cutting back \u2013 it enhances the output of others.</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/robgmacfarlane?lang=en\" title=\"\">Robert Macfarlane</a>, whose \u201cWord of the Day\u201d series has a huge following, has found Twitter to be \u201can overwhelmingly positive experience\u201d. He joined in 2017, a latecomer, \u201chaving spent a couple of years with my ear to Twitter, listening in the stairwell\u201d and has found not only a \u201ccommunity gathered around the account\u201d \u2013 he makes it sound like a campfire \u2013 but an impetus to book writing. \u201cWhen I am on it, I tend to try to respond to readers rapidly and in number. I enjoy that. It can give a buzz and a boost and a filip when you are struggling with a sentence, paragraph or book.\u201d</p> <p>Williams says that while she \u201cwould get more writing done without it \u2026 I do think my writing is better because of Twitter. I think I am able to dispatch images and thoughts more concisely, but limited [in number of] characters.\u201d And while Haig may have taken steps to monitor and restrict his usage, he has also noticed a synergy between his writing and posting. \u201cOn the days I have the highest word count, I also have the highest tweet or <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/mattzhaig/?hl=en\" title=\"\">Instagram</a> count,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s like doing an exercise where you switch between high intensity and low intensity \u2013 a HIIT workout. Writing fiction is the high intensity mode, and Twitter is like jogging on the spot.\u201d</p> <p>Harris doesn\u2019t count her words, so she has no idea if posting on social media works like this for her, too, but she does find that her daily first tweet about the state of the shed in her garden in Huddersfield, where she writes, fulfils an important psychological and ritualistic function. \u201cIt has become a bit of a Zen exercise, part of my writing routine. It gets me into the zone,\u201d she says.</p> <p>In other words, she tweets, and having done so, is ready to write.</p>",

But even so, on social media she veers between \u201cbinge\u201d and \u201ccold turkey\u201d. \u201cEarlier this year with Instagram it was that way. It wasn\u2019t even that I was posting anything, I was going down this rabbit hole\u201d \u2013 food on Instagram, Nigerian politics on Twitter. \u201cI haven\u2019t found a way to use the mediums and still be reasonably productive,\u201d Ad\u00e9b\u00e1y\u00f2 says. This is why the phone with all the apps on it lives in the wardrobe. Sometimes she rewards herself: write four chapters, and you can go on Instagram. \u201cIf I log in, I can spend two hours going from one picture to another. And then what I do is delete the app.\u201d Then, quite often, what she does is discover herself in the process of reinstalling the app. \u201cI am very invested in the idea of being responsible and self-controlled. But even the fact that I have to put the phone in the wardrobe is mortifying for me. Why can\u2019t I just not look at it? Shame is attached to it actually.\u201d \u201cWe have to have some willpower to control how we dip and dive into that space,\u201d the poet Danez Smith agrees. \u201cThat is why the last couple of years I have taken steps to figure out how to put a handle on how much time I spend on social media.\u201d Smith, who uses the pronoun they, felt their social media use had become addictive. \u201cI love my mum but we\u2019d be sitting together and she\u2019d be on Facebook and I\u2019d be on Twitter \u2026 I have been interested in how to train myself out of that.\u201d First, Smith blocked social media altogether on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays \u2013 \u201ca little game that me and my therapist came up with\u201d. Putting on a really long playlist also circumvented phone use. And Smith used Forest, which allows a user to decide their period of inactivity on their phone, and \u201cgrow\u201d a virtual tree in the fallow time. (It dies if you use your phone early: no one wants to kill a tree with a lack of willpower.) But Smith believes that such apps really function as a way \u201cto access my own willpower\u201d. Now Smith and their mum act as checks on each other. \u201cWe put our phones in the other room.\u201d If one of them breaks curfew, \u201cwe\u2019ll both call it out\u201d. For writers who write alone, relying on a companion to stay focused on the right screen is out of the question. And for those who do have a human to rebuke them when they fall off the wagon, this sort of company can be a double-edged sword. Eley Williams, whose short story collection Attrib won the Republic of Consciousness and James Tait Black prizes for fiction last year, sometimes writes in the same room as her partner, the author Nell Stevens. \u201cAnd whenever we write in the same room, we keep glancing when one reaches for the phone, policing the other one while wanting to reach for our own phone, and managing that guilt.\u201d The glancing is \u201cin one way a regulatory thing\u201d, Williams says. But it is also makes it hard to put her own phone out of mind. Hiding the phone in the wardrobe as Ad\u00e9b\u00e1y\u00f2 does \u2013 or throwing it from the desk on to the bed as I like to do \u2013 would make it harder to write, Williams thinks. The phone\u2019s absence \u201cwould be weighing heavily on my mind\u201d, while apps such as Forest or Freedom \u201cwould make me fetishise the idea that pleasure was being deferred \u2013 that Twitter was almost there, but beyond my grasp\u201d, and that, she feels, would be the story of the day. So instead, she writes, and every so often she looks at Twitter. But how often? Every hour? Every 20 minutes? \u201cKeep going!\u201d Williams says, laughing. \u201cProbably every 15 minutes I will find that I am looking at it. There is an element of \u201csafety blanket\u201d. If you are writing on your own, you want some kind of chatter, even ignorable chatter, going on. You need to feel that you could be distracted, just to make your day feel anchored in a real social setting.\u201d What Williams describes \u2013 the frequent, brief sideways look at social media \u2013 is as much a touchstone of the writing life as staring out of the window or at fingernails. Joanne Harris runs a blog, a public Facebook page and uses Instagram, but it is on Twitter where she really spends her social media time (she has tweeted 131,000 times, 50,000 more than Haig, who considers his tally high). She used to be a teacher, and glancing at Twitter is \u201cthe equivalent of popping into the staffroom, grabbing a cup of tea and reading half a page of the newspaper\u201d. Harris uses social media \u201cif I want a break or I want to look something up or\u201d \u2013 and this is a reflex many writers will relate to \u2013 \u201cif I\u2019m just thinking of the end of a sentence and the words won\u2019t come\u201d. Is it detrimental to look at Twitter in those moments of suspended attention or drift? Fiona Mozley finds it so. When her debut novel Elmet was shortlisted for the Booker prize in 2017, Twitter became a less comfortable place to spend time. She noticed that the little glance at Twitter would happen whenever she looked up from her writing. \u201cThe point at which you pause is a really important moment,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s supposed to be when you\u2019re thinking \u2013 about what you\u2019re writing or going to write.\u201d But that little empty space for creation, the blank awaiting a word or a thought, would be filled instead with strings of tweets. She tried writing with a pen to avoid the screen. And then last autumn she deactivated her account to finish her second novel. (She\u2019s back now.) Mozley\u2019s distrust of the usurped pause, her worry about what might be lost in the glance at the wrong screen, makes perfect sense. But the pause works differently for different writers (and sometimes for the same writer at different times). \u201cIf you mean: do I feel I am clicking on Twitter when I should be doing something else? Yes, absolutely,\u201d says Nick Harkaway, who also operates accounts on Instagram, Facebook and Tumblr, with \u201clittle pipes that run from one to the other\u201d, pushing content between his platforms. \u201cWhen I feel that way, I just switch it off. Dump it. It\u2019s not some kind of mad Heath Robinson machine, which will poke you awake in the night. It is individual beings. Negotiating how to communicate with them through social media is just another aspect of being alive today.\u201d For Harkaway, the misspent pause can be beneficial. \u201cThere\u2019s a kind of waiting state,\u201d he says, \u201ca preparatory state that your brain needs to drop into before you do the hard work. It\u2019s a really good idea to take five minutes and not to worry. Now, does Twitter work like that? Potentially. It\u2019s a bunch of white noise, snowflake imagery, then you go: \u2018Right. Now to work.\u2019\u201d Anyhow, he says, in the case of any interruption, \u201cYou can never tell what you are losing and gaining. Without the person from Porlock, would the second half [of \u201cKubla Khan\u201d] have been atrocious? Because quite a lot of [Coleridge\u2019s] poetry would have been better if someone had come and interrupted him.\u201d Harkaway thinks he mostly succumbs to distractions when his work is going badly. Joyce Carol Oates, another prolific tweeter, agrees with this. \u201cI don\u2019t find social media a particular temptation,\u201d she replies. \u201cI suppose that I am more interested in my work \u2026 \u201d And while some writers find that social media distracts from writing \u2013 Danez Smith has become \u201cmore productive in my poetry, more active in my reading\u201d since cutting back \u2013 it enhances the output of others. Robert Macfarlane, whose \u201cWord of the Day\u201d series has a huge following, has found Twitter to be \u201can overwhelmingly positive experience\u201d. He joined in 2017, a latecomer, \u201chaving spent a couple of years with my ear to Twitter, listening in the stairwell\u201d and has found not only a \u201ccommunity gathered around the account\u201d \u2013 he makes it sound like a campfire \u2013 but an impetus to book writing. \u201cWhen I am on it, I tend to try to respond to readers rapidly and in number. I enjoy that. It can give a buzz and a boost and a filip when you are struggling with a sentence, paragraph or book.\u201d Williams says that while she \u201cwould get more writing done without it \u2026 I do think my writing is better because of Twitter. I think I am able to dispatch images and thoughts more concisely, but limited [in number of] characters.\u201d And while Haig may have taken steps to monitor and restrict his usage, he has also noticed a synergy between his writing and posting. \u201cOn the days I have the highest word count, I also have the highest tweet or Instagram count,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s like doing an exercise where you switch between high intensity and low intensity \u2013 a HIIT workout. Writing fiction is the high intensity mode, and Twitter is like jogging on the spot.\u201d Harris doesn\u2019t count her words, so she has no idea if posting on social media works like this for her, too, but she does find that her daily first tweet about the state of the shed in her garden in Huddersfield, where she writes, fulfils an important psychological and ritualistic function. \u201cIt has become a bit of a Zen exercise, part of my writing routine. It gets me into the zone,\u201d she says. In other words, she tweets, and having done so, is ready to write.",

As a season-long employee of Ibiza\u2019s most dazzling party of the decade, she has learned to set some ground rules. Long beards are a no-no, they use up too much product. And she recoils in mock horror at the thought of getting stuck into a hairy chest. \u201cBut girl\u2019s chests are fine\u201d she says.</p> <p>Anything goes at Glitterbox, within reason. Birthed in Ibiza in 2014 and currently held at the superclub <a href=\"https://www.hiibiza.com/en\">H\u00ef</a>, the weekly house and disco night aims to distil the ephemeral hedonism of classic disco nights, such as New York\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/nov/12/new-york-city-clubs-golden-age\">Paradise Garage</a>, with a little of Mudd Club\u2019s scuffed-up edge, diverse bookings and a rotating phalanx of resplendent LGBTQ+ dancers. That\u2019s a bold approach in Ibiza, the global epicentre for commercial dance that\u2019s still dominated by older male DJs such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/aug/14/on-my-radar-carl-cox-stevie-wonder-cloverfield-lane-ross-noble\">Carl Cox</a>, Martin Garrix and, sadly, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/dec/16/david-guetta-dj-music-producer-ryan-gosling-grumpy-people-tv-in-bed-love\">David Guetta</a>, with his excruciatingly titled party Fuck Me I\u2019m Famous. But the ethos is working for Glitterbox: punters pack out H\u00ef\u2019s 5,500 capacity every Sunday in the summer, and the night also hosts one-off events at London\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/nov/13/how-we-made-ministry-sound-london\">Ministry of Sound</a> and New York\u2019s House of Yes.</p> <p>Glitterbox\u2019s ultra-inclusive policy to unite \u201call ages, persuasions and walks of life on the dancefloor\u201d is made flesh by the dazzling dancers, who clamber onto podiums to create focal points across the club\u2019s three dancefloors (including one with a DJ booth in the unisex loos). The performers include shirtless hunk Raven, the Shirley-Temple-on-acid drag of TeTe Bang, and Lucy Fizz, a transgender dancer whose vivacious attitude and turbocharged moves have made her Glitterbox\u2019s most beloved regular. After an uplifting set from Joey Negro, the ensemble swarm onto podiums to dance behind Honey Dijon as she whips between disco-house rarities and unexpected pop moments such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/shortcuts/2019/aug/27/good-as-hell-why-lizzo-is-the-feel-good-superstar-everyone-needs\">Lizzo</a>\u2019s body-positive hit <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaCrQL_8eMY\">Juice</a>.

We wanted to bring that back.\u201d After a few disastrous first nights (Dunmore blames a clash with that summer\u2019s World Cup games), Glitterbox was getting 1,200 people through its doors by September. That number has grown, summer-on-summer, since then.</p> <p>Ibiza has over a dozen gay bars in its Old Town, but it\u2019s still trying to shake the reputation that one friend described to me as \u201caggressively heterosexual.\u201d Glitterbox seems like the closest thing to a queer party here, but given that the island is a majority-straight destination, LGBTQ+ clubbers, such as myself, are a minority at the night itself. As it reaches its 3am apex, I find myself surrounded by tanned English twentysomethings in floral prints and shimmery mesh outfits and briefly wonder if I have been teleported to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/love-island\">Love Island</a>\u2019s Casa Amor. Hearteningly, I spot a group of gay guys on the dancefloor, but it\u2019s an odd sensation to be the only person singing along to Madonna\u2019s Vogue.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, it is predominantly heteronormative,\u201d says trans DJ and producer Dijon, speaking about Ibiza nightlife in general. \u201cBut there are a lot of queer people here. They\u2019re just more interspersed throughout the parties.

At the night\u2019s fun pre-party at Cafe Mambo, I chat to Reece Le Beau, a 21-year-old dancer with a flawlessly <a href=\"https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=beat%20face\">beat face</a>. He has performed at gay parties at London\u2019s Heaven and Metropolis, but says they \u201cdon\u2019t compare\u201d to Glitterbox. He becomes tongue-tied when trying to find the words for the night\u2019s particular magic. \u201cI can\u2019t explain it,\u201d he says. \u201cI just feel special.\u201d</p> <p>Fizz, clad in some kind of <a href=\"https://www.vogue.com/article/bob-mackie-to-receive-geoffrey-beene-lifetime-achievement-award-2019-cfda-awards\">Bob-Mackie-for-Cher</a>-esque fabulosity, jumps in. \u201cAs a trans woman, I really understand the importance of having dedicated LGBTQ+ spaces,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I think there\u2019s so much more wealth to be added to nightlife when everyone comes together and celebrates the music.\u201d And as for the island\u2019s lads-lads-lads reputation? Undeserved. \u201cI grew up with all those Ibiza Uncovered-type programmes,\u201d says Fizz. \u201cIt put me off. Then I came with Glitterbox and I\u2019ve seen this other side of the island. I feel more comfortable going out to the straight nights here than I do in London. I see less fights, less dickhead laddish behaviour.\u201d</p> <p>Dunmore says that Glitterbox\u2019s accepting vibe is largely self-regulated. \u201cI think everyone who\u2019s not comfortable with us being LGBTQ+ friendly probably isn\u2019t going to come,\u201d he says drily. But the evening doesn\u2019t come cheap. Entry is an eye-watering \u20ac50, or \u20ac40 for an early entry ticket. Gin and tonics \u2013 they only serve doubles \u2013 are a hefty \u20ac18. No wonder so many people are clutching water bottles and chewing gum.</p> <p>It\u2019s undeniably a good thing to make all clubbing a little less heteronormative, as well as to remind audiences \u2013 including LGBTQ+ fans \u2013 that <a href=\"https://www.residentadvisor.net/features/1927\">dance music\u2019s roots are queer, black, and Latinx</a>. But Glitterbox illuminates tension between those who are rightly protective of LGBTQ+ spaces and culture, and those who celebrate when boundaries between gay and straight nightlife are weakened. On the night, it felt a bit like a gay night for straight people. I asked Dijon what she thought, as a more seasoned clubber. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re trying to introduce queer music to a straight audience,\u201d she replied. \u201cI think they\u2019re just reflecting the way that house music has always been. Having dancers, vibrancy, and drag artists \u2013 this has always been a part of dance music culture.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d834ce8fee743bf6f728647087a6ca59dcf3384c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d834ce8fee743bf6f728647087a6ca59dcf3384c/0_0_2500_1668/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The MxFit performing at Glitterbox.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Dancers, vibrancy, and drag artists \u2013 this has always been a part of dance music culture\u2019 ...

      "bodyText": "When it comes to sparkle application, the women crewing up Glitterbox\u2019s \u201cglitter stations\u201d are used to outlandish requests. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard it all!\u201d explains the scouse woman who is currently smearing specks of blue on my face. As a season-long employee of Ibiza\u2019s most dazzling party of the decade, she has learned to set some ground rules. Long beards are a no-no, they use up too much product. And she recoils in mock horror at the thought of getting stuck into a hairy chest. \u201cBut girl\u2019s chests are fine\u201d she says. Anything goes at Glitterbox, within reason. Birthed in Ibiza in 2014 and currently held at the superclub H\u00ef, the weekly house and disco night aims to distil the ephemeral hedonism of classic disco nights, such as New York\u2019s Paradise Garage, with a little of Mudd Club\u2019s scuffed-up edge, diverse bookings and a rotating phalanx of resplendent LGBTQ+ dancers. That\u2019s a bold approach in Ibiza, the global epicentre for commercial dance that\u2019s still dominated by older male DJs such as Carl Cox, Martin Garrix and, sadly, David Guetta, with his excruciatingly titled party Fuck Me I\u2019m Famous. But the ethos is working for Glitterbox: punters pack out H\u00ef\u2019s 5,500 capacity every Sunday in the summer, and the night also hosts one-off events at London\u2019s Ministry of Sound and New York\u2019s House of Yes. Glitterbox\u2019s ultra-inclusive policy to unite \u201call ages, persuasions and walks of life on the dancefloor\u201d is made flesh by the dazzling dancers, who clamber onto podiums to create focal points across the club\u2019s three dancefloors (including one with a DJ booth in the unisex loos). The performers include shirtless hunk Raven, the Shirley-Temple-on-acid drag of TeTe Bang, and Lucy Fizz, a transgender dancer whose vivacious attitude and turbocharged moves have made her Glitterbox\u2019s most beloved regular. After an uplifting set from Joey Negro, the ensemble swarm onto podiums to dance behind Honey Dijon as she whips between disco-house rarities and unexpected pop moments such as Lizzo\u2019s body-positive hit Juice. As they flank tonight\u2019s other DJs \u2013 Todd Terry, DJ Harvey, Nightmares on Wax and more \u2013 the performers can make you feel as if you\u2019re in a mad immersive theatre production; as if Punchdrunk did nightclubs. When Glitterbox was founded five years ago, it was a welcome respite from the electronic dance music and techno nights that dominated the island\u2019s nightlife. \u201cI remember going to Ibiza in 1986 and 1988 and the dancefloors had real personality,\u201d says Simon Dunmore, Glitterbox\u2019s driving force and the founder of house label, Defected. \u201cIt was real hedonism, and there were real fashionista personalities. We wanted to bring that back.\u201d After a few disastrous first nights (Dunmore blames a clash with that summer\u2019s World Cup games), Glitterbox was getting 1,200 people through its doors by September. That number has grown, summer-on-summer, since then. Ibiza has over a dozen gay bars in its Old Town, but it\u2019s still trying to shake the reputation that one friend described to me as \u201caggressively heterosexual.\u201d Glitterbox seems like the closest thing to a queer party here, but given that the island is a majority-straight destination, LGBTQ+ clubbers, such as myself, are a minority at the night itself. As it reaches its 3am apex, I find myself surrounded by tanned English twentysomethings in floral prints and shimmery mesh outfits and briefly wonder if I have been teleported to Love Island\u2019s Casa Amor. Hearteningly, I spot a group of gay guys on the dancefloor, but it\u2019s an odd sensation to be the only person singing along to Madonna\u2019s Vogue. \u201cYeah, it is predominantly heteronormative,\u201d says trans DJ and producer Dijon, speaking about Ibiza nightlife in general. \u201cBut there are a lot of queer people here. They\u2019re just more interspersed throughout the parties. I think it\u2019s great that they can come and feel comfortable in these spaces that aren\u2019t specifically queer.\u201d Maybe it\u2019s the serotonin and sangria, but Glitterbox\u2019s atmosphere feels friendly and safe.

We meet for lunch in Covent Garden, outdoors at the Petersham Nurseries\u2019 West End home<a href=\"https://petershamnurseries.com/dine/la-goccia\" title=\"\"> La Goccia</a>, and she confesses as she sits down that she is drawn to spaces like this, which remind her of her other home city. \u201cI seek out courtyards,\u201d she says. \u201cPreferably some water, some greenery, sun. I love eating in courtyards, and there are not that many here.\u201d</p> <p>Shafak, 47, is an open and spirited presence. Though she writes with apparently equal fluency in English and Turkish she says she still feels \u201cher mind runs slightly ahead of her tongue\u201d in her second language, which makes her a very careful listener. She moved to London 10 years ago with her husband and two children after another novel,<em> </em><em>The Bastard of Istanbul</em>, led to a trial for \u201cinsulting Turkishness\u201d (she was eventually acquitted). Her latest novel has been seized along with two earlier books <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/may/31/turkey-puts-novelists-including-elif-shafak-under-investigation\" title=\"\">and is being examined by the Turkish authorities</a> for \u201ccrimes of obscenity\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cBecause I write about sexual harassment, violence against women, the police have taken my books to the prosecutor\u2019s office,\u201d she says. \u201cThey take one sentence, something a character has said, and attribute that to the writer. When you are a woman, the attacks are much more severe. And there is a call from these bots and trolls online to put you in prison. From that the Ministry of Justice claims there is a public demand to investigate \u2026\u201d</p> <p>Do the attempts to silence her \u2013 she was also recently subjected to months of online hate from conservative Islamic groups for having come out as bisexual \u2013 have an effect on her?</p> <p>\u201cI learned to pay attention to the readers and not to the madness,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause to be a writer in Turkey is a bit like being kissed on one cheek and slapped on the other.\u201d</p> <p>If things are bad for novelists, she says, they are worse for journalists.

      "body": "<p>Moral legacies are hard to pin down and even harder to escape. The need to balance atonement and desire for societies to heal and move forward is a changeable alchemy. The Czech writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/milankundera\" title=\"\">Milan Kundera</a> called it the \u201cstruggle against forgetting\u201d and two countries, both successful and prosperous democracies, provide contrasting case studies. Germany and the US treat their heritage of racially motivated evils very differently and the consequences are explored in a wide-ranging odyssey by the American philosopher and essayist Susan Neiman. <em>Learning From the Germans: Confronting Race and the Memory of </em><em>Evil</em> is part memoir, part prescription and a project heavily influenced by her own biography.</p> <p>Growing up in the American south during the civil rights era, and spending much of her adult life in and around Berlin as a Jewish woman, Neiman has a keen ear for discomforts and awkwardnesses and the small tics of guilt and avoidance.</p> <p>\u201cThe question of whether Jews should count as white people was not quite settled in the south where I grew up,\u201d she writes.</p> <p>A relative of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmett_Till\" title=\"\">Emmett Till</a>, a teenager lynched for allegedly offending a white woman in Mississippi in 1955, cites a grim local observation: \u201cIf I was Catholic and I lived in the south, I\u2019d be worried. If I was Jewish, I\u2019d be packing up. If I was black, I\u2019d be gone.\u201d</p> <p>Settling in West<strong> </strong>Berlin in 1982 (a year before the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/jan/03/channel-4-cold-war-drama-deutschland-83\" title=\"\"><em>Deutschland 1983</em></a> turbulences over the stationing of rival nuclear warheads in a divided Germany), her interest turns to <em>Vergangenheitsaufarbeitung</em> \u2013 a fine German mouthful, meaning \u201cworking through the past\u201d.</p> <p>Neiman reckons Germany has got this right in relation to its dealings with Hitler\u2019s legacy; and America, especially the south, has not, when it comes to facing its own record on the legacy of slavery and racial bias. She points out that Berlin alone has more than 400 monuments to the victims<strong> </strong>of the Nazi tyranny, including a recent innovation of <em>Stolpersteine</em> \u2013 \u201cstumble stones\u201d \u2013 the raised concrete brass plates on the city\u2019s pavements inscribed with the names of victims of the regime.

      "bodyText": "Moral legacies are hard to pin down and even harder to escape. The need to balance atonement and desire for societies to heal and move forward is a changeable alchemy. The Czech writer Milan Kundera called it the \u201cstruggle against forgetting\u201d and two countries, both successful and prosperous democracies, provide contrasting case studies. Germany and the US treat their heritage of racially motivated evils very differently and the consequences are explored in a wide-ranging odyssey by the American philosopher and essayist Susan Neiman. Learning From the Germans: Confronting Race and the Memory of Evil is part memoir, part prescription and a project heavily influenced by her own biography. Growing up in the American south during the civil rights era, and spending much of her adult life in and around Berlin as a Jewish woman, Neiman has a keen ear for discomforts and awkwardnesses and the small tics of guilt and avoidance. \u201cThe question of whether Jews should count as white people was not quite settled in the south where I grew up,\u201d she writes. A relative of Emmett Till, a teenager lynched for allegedly offending a white woman in Mississippi in 1955, cites a grim local observation: \u201cIf I was Catholic and I lived in the south, I\u2019d be worried. If I was Jewish, I\u2019d be packing up. If I was black, I\u2019d be gone.\u201d Settling in West Berlin in 1982 (a year before the Deutschland 1983 turbulences over the stationing of rival nuclear warheads in a divided Germany), her interest turns to Vergangenheitsaufarbeitung \u2013 a fine German mouthful, meaning \u201cworking through the past\u201d. Neiman reckons Germany has got this right in relation to its dealings with Hitler\u2019s legacy; and America, especially the south, has not, when it comes to facing its own record on the legacy of slavery and racial bias. She points out that Berlin alone has more than 400 monuments to the victims of the Nazi tyranny, including a recent innovation of Stolpersteine \u2013 \u201cstumble stones\u201d \u2013 the raised concrete brass plates on the city\u2019s pavements inscribed with the names of victims of the regime. It is far harder to find major monuments to the victims of racial oppression across the US, let alone in the slavery heartland of the south. Clearly, modern Germany diligently observes its duty toward the past with care and builds that into its political traditions \u2013 the image of Willy Brandt falling to his knees in the Warsaw ghetto in 1970 created a template for repentance. All of this is, as Neiman points out, a laudable part of modern Germany\u2019s DNA. Yet I think she underplays the extent to which the task of \u201cworking through\u201d history becomes ritualistic. My first reporting assignment in West Germany in 1988 involved spending time in a school in which their progressive history teacher delivered a brilliantly prepared lesson on the Third Reich while his class of teenagers asked insistently what they were \u201csupposed to feel\u201d about events they felt were not connected with them. The passage of more time and death of the generation with direct experience of Hitler\u2019s Germany makes that gulf wider and more acute \u2013 one reason that the AfD can prosper in the east and (less commonly observed) make inroads into the conservative vote in wealthy parts of Germany, too. Where the account goes awfully wrong is in the musings on East Germany, where Neiman is prone to accepting the GDR\u2019s self-serving use of its \u201canti-fascist\u201d badging at a face value it never merited, despite the good faith of many cultural figures in the idea. East Germany was sired by Stalinism. Former Nazis were allowed to take \u201cuseful\u201d positions in the state apparatus. When I worked with Markus Wolf, the former head of East German intelligence, on his memoirs, his admission that most shocked me was that the east had, at one point, tacitly supported neo-Nazi demonstrations in the west, perversely in order to demonstrate the revival of fascism in the Federal Republic. The account of the east today is a medley of interviews with a lot of people from the 1989 opposition movements. It would be a bit like talking about Brexit Britain through the eyes of a lot of Remainers and Lib Dems. The narrative of \u201ccolonisation\u201d of the east by the west after unification is treated unsceptically. Alas, relativism about communist regimes always ends up trying to excuse the inexcusable, while insisting that it is not doing so. Tout comprendre is not the same as tout pardonner and no amount of \u201cwhataboutery\u201d can change that.

      "body": "<p>After his Week 1 masterpiece against Miami, which <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/boxscore?gameId=401127954\">included five touchdowns and a perfect passer rating</a>, Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson mocked the long-held notion that he is an NFL running back disguised as a quarterback. It\u2019s been a hard stigma to shake for Jackson given his usage last year featured almost as many rushing attempts per game (9.2) as passing attempts (10.2). But two games into the season we have a vastly different narrative. Jackson has emerged as an early MVP candidate on the strength of his arm.</p> <p>This week in the Ravens\u2019 23-17 win over Arizona, Jackson rushed for 122 yards on 13 carries, a spectacular stat line for a running back. Yet this game showcased Jackson\u2019s maturation as a quarterback. Jackson again commanded the aerial attack, passing for 272 yards, two scores and no turnovers. His pocket awareness and ownership of the offense was on display throughout.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/15/new-england-patriots-antonio-brown-nfl-scores\">NFL round-up: Brown catches TD in Patriots debut; Roethlisberger hurt in Steelers loss</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Jackson\u2019s rushing onslaught came from his ability to scan the field, pinpoint defensive collapses on the edge and use the fastest man on the field to take advantage. But he also executed a crafty playbook that featured screens, misdirections and plenty of strikes. All told Sunday\u2019s encore, while not perfect, was in many ways more impressive than last week. In showcasing his complete bag of tricks, Jackson further solidified himself as the Ravens\u2019 maestro, and he deserves us all to harmonize from a mountaintop: LAMAR JACKSON IS A QUARTERBACK.</p> <p>Exhale. That was a long time coming.</p> <p>Jackson won the Heisman Trophy as a sophomore at Louisville. Sure, he tallied a lot of yards with his feet but also displayed innate instincts as a passer and the type of field vision that is critical at the next level when everything is in double speed. Still, he was tabbed by scouts as a project, supremely talented but raw. As an aside, this type of \u201cproject\u201d distinction is rarely used on white quarterbacks or any that fit the size and stature of a prototypical quarterback.</p> <p>The Ravens moved up to nab Jackson with the 32<sup>nd</sup> pick in the 2018 draft, assuming he would study under the veteran Joe Flacco for a year or so. But Flacco , who has been on the decline since the Ravens won the Super Bowl in 2013, was benched. Last year\u2019s conservative offensive coordinator, Marty Mornhinweg lacked an elaborate plan for Jackson, nor did he trust Jackson as a regular play action quarterback so the rookie ran and ran and ran some more. Paired with a top flight defense, the Ravens went on a winning streak until they fizzled in the first round of the playoffs.</p> <p>Everything was different this offseason. Flacco was shipped to Denver, Mornhinweg was replaced as offensive coordinator by the far more dynamic Greg Roman and Jackson operated like the team\u2019s leader. He led offseason throwing sessions with his receivers, which now included the speedy rookie sensation Marquise \u201cHollywood\u201d Brown. He bulked up. He studied the new playbook. He showed up at training camp ready to execute a bold offense.</p> <p>There were multiple moments in Sunday\u2019s win over the Cardinals that showcased both Jackson\u2019s ability and Roman\u2019s trust in his quarterback. Moments that never would have been schemed last season. The first came in the first quarter when Jackson faked an end-around screen to Brown, dropped back and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Ravens/status/1173284380871020544\">then hit a wide-open Mark Andrews for a 27-yard touchdown</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Ravens/status/1173327000108355584\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">WHAT \u2757\ufe0f\u2757\ufe0f<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Lj_era8?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Lj_era8</a> to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Primetime_jet?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Primetime_jet</a> for 41 yards\u2757\ufe0f\u2757\ufe0f <a href=\"https://t.co/vgbZDHLLwB\">pic.twitter.com/vgbZDHLLwB</a></p>&mdash; Baltimore Ravens (@Ravens) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Ravens/status/1173327000108355584?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 15, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>The other sealed the game. With 3:03 left and the Ravens up six facing 3<sup>rd</sup> and 11, Jackson dropped an absolute beauty of a rainbow in the waiting arms of Brown for 41-yards.</p> <p>The runs were spectacular as well but they really stemmed from Jackson\u2019s ability to recognize coverage at the line, such as another key moment in the final quarter on 3<sup>rd</sup> and 20 when he took off after seeing man-to-man. Few of the runs seemed by design.</p> <p>The Ravens are now 2-0 in a division that so far isn\u2019t quite powerful as many predicted. The Steelers and Bengals are 0-2, the Browns lost in Week 1.

With one second on the clock, Eddy Pineiro hit a 53-yard field goal to punctuate the Bears\u2019 16-14 win over the Broncos in one of the strangest finishes you\u2019ll see. To recap: The Broncos scored with 37 seconds left and could have kicked an extra point to tie. Instead new Broncos head coach Vic Fangio, who was the Bears defensive coordinator the past few seasons, opted to go for the win. One delay of game, a Bears penalty on the missed extra point and a successful two-point conversation later, the Broncos took a one-point lead. With 31 seconds left and aided by a questionable roughing the passer call on Bradley Chubb, the Bears were in field goal range and voila, Pineiro temporarily rid the franchise of its demons.</p> <p>The Bears were devastated by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/07/cody-parker-chicago-bears-philadelphia-eagles-nfl-playoffs\">Cody Parker\u2019s 43-yd double doink miss in the NFC divisional round</a> that ended the Bears last season.

Pineiro emerged and amid all the emphasis on kicking success has been stellar with a perfect 4-for-4 on the season. He was instrumental Sunday in a defensive battle where kicking was crucial, knocking two field goals 50-yards through the uprights. But the deeper impact is a Bears win that changes the trajectory of their season.

Jim Harbaugh was the head coach, Alex Smith was the starting quarterback and the 49ers advanced to the Super Bowl. \u2022 The Saints signed Sean Payton to a contract extension that will keep him in New Orleans through 2024. Translation: Payton\u2019s not going to Dallas any time soon, a rumor that pops up from time-to-time.",

With nigh-on a full team of players out injured, the odds of stopping Manchester City looked insurmountable. Instead Daniel Farke\u2019s men gave their best performance of the season by far, not only cutting the champions open but looking solid at the back for the first time. There was kudos for the debutants in defence, Sam Byram and Ibrahim Amadou, but also for more seasoned Norwich players. Emi Buend\u00eda and Marco Stiepermann were central to a buccaneering style in the Championship yet had struggled to bring that form to the top flight. With the gauntlet down, however, they delivered. Buend\u00eda contributed two assists and regularly sprung the City press. Stiepermann sparked several counter attacks and crucially reestablished his understanding with Teemu Pukki. <strong>Paul MacInnes</strong></p> \n<p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/14/norwich-city-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Norwich 3-2 Manchester City</a></em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a1bbd90f-8ae8-43af-9a11-d26ce207d0ac\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EdMSWz1y7YY?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>2) Sokratis the latest to show Arsenal must wise up in defence</h2> \n<p>There is a fine line between repeating an experiment until you reach perfection, and continuing it out of stubborn stupidity when the ingredients are clearly wrong. Which camp do you sit in where Arsenal, whose insistence on playing from the back was calamitous against Watford, and Unai Emery are concerned? They had flirted with danger several times before, in a near-action replay of Manchester City\u2019s ridiculous third concession against Norwich, Sokratis Papastathopoulos\u2019s sloppiness allowed Tom Cleverley to hand Watford a lifeline. Bernd Leno could be seen booting the ball long from a goal-kick, to cheers from the away fans, shortly afterwards but Ainsley Maitland-Niles almost let the home team in again later on as Arsenal tried to play short again. The new rule that allows players to receive a goal-kick inside the area has been grasped enthusiastically by many managers but it is not heresy to remind them you do not have to take advantage of it \u2013 particularly if your players are not up to the job. <strong>Nick Ames</strong></p> \n<p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/15/watford-arsenal-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Watford 2-2 Arsenal</a></em></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/sep/15/quique-sanchez-flores-watford-arsenal\">Watford look like their old selves now Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores is back | Nick Ames</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2>3) Firmino reminiscent of Cantona</h2> \n<p>His collar is not popped like Eric Cantona and his character could not be more different from the philosophising Frenchman but Roberto Firmino reminded Steve Bruce of his former Manchester United colleague with his dismantling of Newcastle. Firmino emerged from the bench at Anfield to provide two glorious assists for Sadio Man\u00e9 and Mohamed Salah as Liverpool eventually broke a well\u2011organised Newcastle unit. \u201cCantona is as good a player as I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Bruce said. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen Firmino week in, week out but what he gives them is a perfect balance. Cantona gave us that. We had Giggs and Kanchelskis who had frightening pace and stretched sides so much like Liverpool\u2019s two [Man\u00e9 and Salah], and Cantona dropped into that hole and people couldn\u2019t get anywhere near them. That\u2019s what you see with Firmino.\u201d <strong>Andy Hunter</strong></p> \n<p><em>Match report:</em><strong> </strong><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/14/liverpool-newcastle-united-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Liverpool 3-1 Newcastle Uniited</a></em></p> \n<h2>4) Maguire deserved more from upset Leicester fans</h2> \n<p>Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r said Harry Maguire would not be too unsettled by the rancour he encountered from the away end at Old Trafford. And there are so many precedents \u2013 to cite just one example, the Blackburn fans\u2019 treatment of Alan Shearer after the player had left Ewood Park \u2013 nobody should have been wholly surprised by the reception for Maguire from the section of Leicester fans. All the same, it did feel perplexing that a player could serve a club with distinction, as Maguire did for Leicester, then leave for \u00a380m, taking care to handle a delicate situation in the right manner and earning the respect of his colleagues in the process, then become public enemy No 1 with their supporters. Maguire can reflect on a satisfying day, making it a frustrating occasion for Jamie Vardy, but he would be entitled to wonder why his first game for United against his old club took place against that kind of ill feeling. <strong>Daniel Taylor</strong></p> \n<p><em>Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/14/manchester-united-leicester-city-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Manchester United 1-0 Leicester City</a></em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"f674f958-10ed-4466-8431-771558277cf9\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LSWy-lAn410?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>5) Son as good with Kane as on his own</h2> \n<p>One school of thought last season was that Son Heung-min becomes a more incisive player when Harry Kane is not in the Tottenham side. Son often starred in a central role if Kane was out with an ankle injury and his performances seemed to dip whenever the team\u2019s star striker returned, leading to talk that the South Korean forward needed to be given more freedom by Mauricio Pochettino. But the relationship between Kane and Son appeared to be in fine working order during this win. They were both excellent and their link play showed they are more than capable of flourishing in the same attack, especially when they combined brilliantly for Erik Lamela\u2019s goal. There were also two dashing goals from Son and although Kane failed to get on the scoresheet, the England captain\u2019s intelligent performance was a reminder of his impressive team ethic. <strong>Jacob Steinberg</strong></p> \n<p><em>Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/14/tottenham-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Tottenham Hotspur 4-0 Crystal Palace</a></em></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/gallery/2019/sep/15/the-dozen-guardiolas-grief-and-luizs-lunge-the-best-premier-league-pictures\">The Dozen: Guardiola's grief and David Luiz's lunge \u2013 the best Premier League pictures</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2>6) Change forced on Wolves is making them weaker</h2> \n<p>The season began for Wolves with a lot of optimistic talk about whether they might be able to go one better than last season and break into the top six. They had shown they could beat the big sides; surely it couldn\u2019t be that hard to maintain that but start winning against the teams in the bottom half of the table as well. But five games in, Wolves are still without a league victory. Although they improved drastically after half\u2011time, there was an odd passivity to them in the first half. Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo denied the Europa League was an issue, as he probably has to, but this is a recurring pattern. If nothing else, it has forced him to chop and change his team in a way that he didn\u2019t last season. Wolves surely are too good to be seriously involved in a relegation scrap, but there needs to be an improvement soon. <strong>Jonathan Wilson </strong></p> \n<p><em>Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/14/wolves-chelsea-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Wolves 2-5 Chelsea</a></em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"02a583cb-3a7f-4746-92f2-725889dfb0ab\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/aoX5rzTw6_M?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>7) Cook dazzles on Bournemouth comeback</h2> \n<p>After nine months out, it was as if Lewis Cook had never been away. The Bournemouth midfielder returned to action with the kind of tenacity and grit that truly makes Eddie Howe\u2019s side tick, not to mention the 22-year-old\u2019s wonderful palette of passing. Cook orchestrated things before being given a well-earned breather 13 minutes from time. A standing ovation followed suit, with Howe equally enthused. \u201cIncredible,\u201d Howe said. \u201cHe handles the ball in any situation and you saw early in the match how he manipulated himself out of some really difficult holes.\u201d With the summer recruits Lloyd Kelly, 20, and Arnaut Danjuma, 22, yet to make their debut for the club, there are reasons to be cheerful. \u201cWhen we have more options, with some of the outstanding young players we have out injured, it\u2019s going to be an exciting team to manage,\u201d Howe said. <strong>Ben Fisher</strong></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/15/tammy-abraham-chelsea-wolves-mason-mount-fikayo-tomori\">Tammy Abraham revels up front but Chelsea need to tighten up at the back</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2>8) Kean needs game time instead of Calvert-Lewin</h2> \n<p>Dominic Calvert-Lewin can certainly do a job in the Premier League, but if Everton want to move up the table it might be time for Marco Silva to consider starting Moise Kean for a run of games. Calvert-Lewin is happy to chase and battle but does not currently possess the requisite qualities to make him into a lone striker, despite his goal at Bournemouth. Kean, on the other hand, came off the bench at the Vitality Stadium and, along with fellow substitute Bernard, made Everton look more dynamic in the final third, even if they failed to provide the goals necessary to get back into the game. Kean is a young striker and has just arrived from Italy, so will need time to settle but he could adapt far quicker by being on the pitch and learning about the Premier League, rather than taking inspiration from his Everton colleagues. <strong>Will Unwin</strong></p> \n<p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2019/sep/15/bournemouth-v-everton-premier-league-live\" title=\"\">Bournemouth 3-1 Everton</a></em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  <strong>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</strong>\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>9) Potter\u2019s tweaks likely to bear fruit soon</h2> \n<p>Chalk came up against cheese on the south coast with a meeting of two clubs trying to consolidate their mid-table status by opposite means: Brighton through the pass\u2011and\u2011move blueprint of Graham Potter, Burnley by the no-frills ferocity of Dycheball. And as Brighton hogged possession while Burnley sent searching balls towards their strapping forwards, the game largely played out as expected. There was a certain irony, then, that the visitors\u2019 late point came from a move of crisp one-touch passing, Matej Vydra\u2019s flicked lay\u2011off slammed home superbly by Jeff Hendrick. Brighton\u2019s eight-game winless run at the Amex Stadium may seem like cause for concern but Potter\u2019s early tweak here \u2013 switching to a back four after a tepid opening half an hour \u2013 and the dominance it heralded suggests that his methods will serve them well in the long run. <strong>Alex Hess</strong></p> \n<p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/14/brighton-hove-albion-burnley-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Brighton 1-1 Burnley</a></em></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/10/premier-league-la-liga-bundesliga-serie-a-and-ligue-1-top-scorers-2019-20\">Premier League, La Liga, Bundesliga, Serie A and Ligue 1 top scorers 2019-20</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2>10) VAR gives but Hasenh\u00fcttl knows it can take too</h2> \n<p>The officials were booed off, perhaps predictably given VAR had ruled out a Sheffield United goal for a fractional offside, failed to award a penalty when the ball hit James Ward-Prowse\u2019s arm and not even managed to come to Billy Sharp\u2019s aid when his studs lightly raked Stuart Armstrong\u2019s shin. Yet though unpopular, two of the decisions were technically correct and the other endlessly debatable. \u201cVAR is a fantastic tool, it makes the game fairer,\u201d Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl said. He would say that with the points in the bag, but the Southampton manager also accepted the handball interpretation will always prove subjective. \u201cMaybe we got lucky today with the team in the replay room. Perhaps on another day a different set of officials will rule against us. We will have to accept that, because unintentional handball is always difficult for any referee.\u201d <strong>Paul Wilson</strong></p> \n<p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a

That\u2019s what you see with Firmino.\u201d Andy Hunter Match report: Liverpool 3-1 Newcastle Uniited 4) Maguire deserved more from upset Leicester fans Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r said Harry Maguire would not be too unsettled by the rancour he encountered from the away end at Old Trafford. And there are so many precedents \u2013 to cite just one example, the Blackburn fans\u2019 treatment of Alan Shearer after the player had left Ewood Park \u2013 nobody should have been wholly surprised by the reception for Maguire from the section of Leicester fans. All the same, it did feel perplexing that a player could serve a club with distinction, as Maguire did for Leicester, then leave for \u00a380m, taking care to handle a delicate situation in the right manner and earning the respect of his colleagues in the process, then become public enemy No 1 with their supporters. Maguire can reflect on a satisfying day, making it a frustrating occasion for Jamie Vardy, but he would be entitled to wonder why his first game for United against his old club took place against that kind of ill feeling. Daniel Taylor Match report: Manchester United 1-0 Leicester City 5) Son as good with Kane as on his own One school of thought last season was that Son Heung-min becomes a more incisive player when Harry Kane is not in the Tottenham side. Son often starred in a central role if Kane was out with an ankle injury and his performances seemed to dip whenever the team\u2019s star striker returned, leading to talk that the South Korean forward needed to be given more freedom by Mauricio Pochettino. But the relationship between Kane and Son appeared to be in fine working order during this win. They were both excellent and their link play showed they are more than capable of flourishing in the same attack, especially when they combined brilliantly for Erik Lamela\u2019s goal. There were also two dashing goals from Son and although Kane failed to get on the scoresheet, the England captain\u2019s intelligent performance was a reminder of his impressive team ethic. Jacob Steinberg Match report: Tottenham Hotspur 4-0 Crystal Palace 6) Change forced on Wolves is making them weaker The season began for Wolves with a lot of optimistic talk about whether they might be able to go one better than last season and break into the top six. They had shown they could beat the big sides; surely it couldn\u2019t be that hard to maintain that but start winning against the teams in the bottom half of the table as well. But five games in, Wolves are still without a league victory. Although they improved drastically after half\u2011time, there was an odd passivity to them in the first half. Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo denied the Europa League was an issue, as he probably has to, but this is a recurring pattern. If nothing else, it has forced him to chop and change his team in a way that he didn\u2019t last season. Wolves surely are too good to be seriously involved in a relegation scrap, but there needs to be an improvement soon. Jonathan Wilson Match report: Wolves 2-5 Chelsea 7) Cook dazzles on Bournemouth comeback After nine months out, it was as if Lewis Cook had never been away. The Bournemouth midfielder returned to action with the kind of tenacity and grit that truly makes Eddie Howe\u2019s side tick, not to mention the 22-year-old\u2019s wonderful palette of passing. Cook orchestrated things before being given a well-earned breather 13 minutes from time. A standing ovation followed suit, with Howe equally enthused. \u201cIncredible,\u201d Howe said. \u201cHe handles the ball in any situation and you saw early in the match how he manipulated himself out of some really difficult holes.\u201d With the summer recruits Lloyd Kelly, 20, and Arnaut Danjuma, 22, yet to make their debut for the club, there are reasons to be cheerful. \u201cWhen we have more options, with some of the outstanding young players we have out injured, it\u2019s going to be an exciting team to manage,\u201d Howe said. Ben Fisher 8) Kean needs game time instead of Calvert-Lewin Dominic Calvert-Lewin can certainly do a job in the Premier League, but if Everton want to move up the table it might be time for Marco Silva to consider starting Moise Kean for a run of games. Calvert-Lewin is happy to chase and battle but does not currently possess the requisite qualities to make him into a lone striker, despite his goal at Bournemouth. Kean, on the other hand, came off the bench at the Vitality Stadium and, along with fellow substitute Bernard, made Everton look more dynamic in the final third, even if they failed to provide the goals necessary to get back into the game. Kean is a young striker and has just arrived from Italy, so will need time to settle but he could adapt far quicker by being on the pitch and learning about the Premier League, rather than taking inspiration from his Everton colleagues. Will Unwin \u2022 Match report: Bournemouth 3-1 Everton 9) Potter\u2019s tweaks likely to bear fruit soon Chalk came up against cheese on the south coast with a meeting of two clubs trying to consolidate their mid-table status by opposite means: Brighton through the pass\u2011and\u2011move blueprint of Graham Potter, Burnley by the no-frills ferocity of Dycheball. And as Brighton hogged possession while Burnley sent searching balls towards their strapping forwards, the game largely played out as expected. There was a certain irony, then, that the visitors\u2019 late point came from a move of crisp one-touch passing, Matej Vydra\u2019s flicked lay\u2011off slammed home superbly by Jeff Hendrick. Brighton\u2019s eight-game winless run at the Amex Stadium may seem like cause for concern but Potter\u2019s early tweak here \u2013 switching to a back four after a tepid opening half an hour \u2013 and the dominance it heralded suggests that his methods will serve them well in the long run. Alex Hess \u2022 Match report: Brighton 1-1 Burnley 10) VAR gives but Hasenh\u00fcttl knows it can take too The officials were booed off, perhaps predictably given VAR had ruled out a Sheffield United goal for a fractional offside, failed to award a penalty when the ball hit James Ward-Prowse\u2019s arm and not even managed to come to Billy Sharp\u2019s aid when his studs lightly raked Stuart Armstrong\u2019s shin. Yet though unpopular, two of the decisions were technically correct and the other endlessly debatable. \u201cVAR is a fantastic tool, it makes the game fairer,\u201d Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl said. He would say that with the points in the bag, but the Southampton manager also accepted the handball interpretation will always prove subjective. \u201cMaybe we got lucky today with the team in the replay room. Perhaps on another day a different set of officials will rule against us. We will have to accept that, because unintentional handball is always difficult for any referee.\u201d Paul Wilson \u2022 Match report: Sheffield United 0-1 Southampton",

      "bodyText": "Known as the \u201cpearl of the Adriatic\u201d, Dubrovnik has become one of the biggest tourist attractions in the Mediterranean. Its charming old town, array of Unesco World Heritage sites and sizeable port were always draws, but the new success of Game of Thrones, much of which was shot in the Croatian city, has made it a particularly popular stopoff point for cruise ships, whose passengers are told they can see the highlights in a single day. A woman in her garden overlooking the new port of Dubrovnik. Smaller boats or tenders take the passengers on to dry land, where they are typically bussed into the old town. Tours often start at the 16th-century Pile Gate, followed by a stroll along the Stradun to the city walls, entrance to which costs \u20ac30 (\u00a327). Game of Thrones locations and Europe\u2019s oldest pharmacy in a 14th-century Franciscan monastery are big pulls. Passengers leaving for excursions to the old city and other parts of Dubrovnik from the AIDAblu cruise ship. Most cruise ship passengers are taken on excursions to the old city and other parts of Dubrovnik by coach. Locals watch from outside the dock perimeter fence as passengers return to MSC Sinfonia after excursions to the old city and other parts of Dubrovnik. Last year around three million visitors descended on the old town, most of them having poured out of around 400 cruise ships docked in the harbour. Critics say they are causing long-term damage to historical sites, but with the livelihoods of 80% of the locals dependent on tourist traffic, some are reluctant to address the problems. Tourists in the old city of Dubrovnik There is increasingly troubling evidence, however, of the dramatic effect the guests are having, not least on the kind of city Dubrovnik will be. Where once there were bookshops, bakeries, butchers, hair salons and markets, tacky souvenir shops and stalls now cater to the tourists. The boats themselves also burn huge amounts of fossil fuel, creating water, air and noise pollution, and severely affect the marine ecosystem. Time for selfies overlooking the old city of Dubrovnik. A growing sense among city residents that tourism has become overtourism has caused the mayor to introduce tighter controls: during mornings just two ships can dock, with a third after midday. Next year a limit of 4,000 daily visitors will be allowed ashore, and in two years each will face a \u20ac2 tax. Passengers getting a tender back to the Le Lyrial from the old city. Passengers relax back on board MSC Sinfonia.

      "bodyText": "Night has fallen on Rio de Janeiro\u2019s Albert Schweitzer hospital, and in its 11th-floor intensive care unit Enzo Coutinho dozes in his aunt\u2019s lap. \u201cSometimes it takes a mountain to trust and believe in you,\u201d Merielle Ventura, a 24-year-old nursery teacher, sings gently into her nephew\u2019s ear. It has been five days since baby Enzo became one of the youngest victims of a new and deadly chapter in Rio de Janeiro\u2019s intractable war on drugs \u2013 gunned down with his teenage mother, Margareth Teixeira, as she carried him to church. His mother was killed. Doctors have placed a television beside the injured infant\u2019s bed, hoping Tom and Jerry cartoons will distract Enzo as they sedate him to clean the bullet wound that nearly cost him his left foot. When he cries out for his mother, family members still struggle to respond. Sometimes it is Enzo\u2019s aunt he calls mum; sometimes his grandmother. Only 48 hours have passed since weeping relatives laid his mother to rest. She was 17 years old. Margareth was one of at least four innocent teenagers shot dead during police operations between 9 and 13 August \u2013 an eruption of killing that was shocking even by Brazilian standards, where there were over 57,000 homicides last year. \u201cIn Rio, killing is a game,\u201d one local tabloid announced on its front page alongside an illustration of blood-spattered Playmobil figures symbolizing Rio\u2019s extinguished youth. The killings are part of a broader surge in police violence playing out under Rio\u2019s hardline state governor, Wilson Witzel, who took power in January promising a frontal assault on the drug gangs who rule most of Rio\u2019s 1,000-odd favelas. Official figures released this week show Witzel \u2013 who hopes to succeed Brazil\u2019s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro \u2013 has been true to his word, with devastating consequences for families like Margareth\u2019s. In the first seven months of this year police caused 30% of all violent deaths in the state of Rio and killed a record 1,075 people \u2013 the highest number in more than two decades. Eighty-eight of those deaths came in the western region where Margareth and Enzo were shot. In July alone police killed 194 people \u2013 a rate of more than six a day \u2013 another two-decade high. \u201cIt is staggering,\u201d said Pablo Nunes, a public security specialist from Rio\u2019s C\u00e2ndido Mendes University. \u201cIt leaves me almost speechless. It is something that in any other democracy in the world would be simply unacceptable and unthinkable.\u201d Witzel has defended his so-called \u201cshoot down\u201d policy, claiming it has reduced crime and insisting \u201cno leniency\u201d can be shown to rifle-toting gangsters he compares to Nazis. In one chilling interview Witzel urged criminals to swap their guns for Bibles, \u201cor we are going to kill you\u201d. But activists accuse the brawny former judge of triggering a bloodbath that is claiming a growing number of civilian lives. Of the four innocent teenagers killed during recent police operations, not one was carrying a rifle. Gabriel Alves, 18, was reportedly school-bound with a bag full of books. Dyogo Costa, 16, was on his way to a football training session with a pair of boots. Henrico de Menezes J\u00fanior, 19, was reportedly going to pick up his motorbike from a repair shop. And Margareth Teixeira, a student who dreamed of joining the police, was en route to a church service, carrying nothing but her 22-month-old boy. Renata Souza, a leftist politician and human rights activist, said every single police shooting demanded thorough investigation. \u201cBut it seems the governor has no interest in this and instead is simply becoming a populist demagogue who believes in nothing but solving violence through confrontation.\u201d \u201cBy opting for confrontation and war, Governor Witzel is deliberately putting at risk the poor, who are caught defenseless in the crossfire,\u201d added Souza, who recently flew to Geneva to denounce Witzel to the UN human rights council. On the night she died, on 13 August, Margareth set off from the home of her parents-in-law with Enzo at about 7.10pm. She had arranged to meet his father, Daniel Coutinho, at an evangelical church in the Favela do 48 community where they lived. But moments after she left a volley of shots rang out, as police launched an incursion supposedly intended to quell clashes between two rival gangs currently squabbling over the area. \u201cThe shooting came from nowhere,\u201d said Margareth\u2019s mother-in-law, F\u00e1tima Coutinho, who recalled thinking: \u201cMy God! Did she make it to church?\u201d When Coutinho reached the place of worship and couldn\u2019t find his wife, he assumed she had sought shelter from the shootout in someone\u2019s home. In fact, Margareth\u2019s bullet-ridden body had already been loaded into an armoured police vehicle and dumped at the Albert Schweitzer, along with those of two alleged gang members. \u201cThe bitch ran off together with the gangsters,\u201d one witness, who saw the bodies arrive, claimed she had been told by a police officer at the hospital. \u201cThat\u2019s why she died.\u201d Despite a public outcry over the rising body count, Witzel has shown no sign of rethinking his hardline tactics, instead blaming the killings on \u201cpseudo human rights activists\u201d who prevent police properly performing their duties. \u201cThese corpses aren\u2019t on me, they\u2019re on you, who don\u2019t let the police do the job that needs to be done,\u201d Witzel said as he was pictured punching the air and jumping for joy after a special forces sniper shot dead a bus hijacker. \u201cAnd the more you defend these narco-terrorists, the more corpses you will be to blame for.\u201d Coutinho said he wanted answers over how she was killed \u2013 and by whom. Margareth\u2019s sister, Merielle, said she had counted five entry wounds on her body \u2013 three on the front of her chest and two on the side \u2013 although some reports suggested she was shot 10 times. \u201cIf it was 10 shots, these weren\u2019t stray bullets,\u201d Coutinho said. \u201cThis was an execution.\u201d Enzo\u2019s father was employed in a clothes shop until last week\u2019s shooting, using his salary to pay the family\u2019s \u00a350-a-month ($61) rent in the favela. But the 21-year-old has been unable to return to work since the shooting: he hardly eats, he hardly sleeps and he cries when he remembers the woman he loved. \u201cI saw her body. I buried her. But I still can\u2019t believe she is dead,\u201d he said. Enzo was discharged from hospital in late August and will be raised in his grandparents\u2019 three-bedroom home overlooking the favela where his mother lived and died. His cot \u2013 stamped with the bright red symbol of Rio\u2019s Flamengo football club \u2013 now sits in his grandparents\u2019 room and his father will sleep next door. \u201cEnzo needs me, and I need him too,\u201d said Coutinho. \u201cNow, I\u2019m a dad and a mum.\u201d Additional reporting by Tom Phillips",

Crossbench MP Rebekha Sharkie introduced a draft bill to the lower house this morning that would compel political parties to disclose donations within five days. This would effectively enforce the real-time declaration of disclosures and mirror arrangements in place at a state level in Queensland and Victoria. The bill has a difficult path before it. <br></p> <p>But if nothing else, this latest reform attempt reminds us of the parlous state of funding transparency in Australian politics. Currently, we only find out who has donated to political parties once a year in February. That means the public won\u2019t find out who bankrolled the Labor and Liberal election campaigns until nine months after the fact. </p> <p>Even then, parties are only required to disclose donations above $14,000, a threshold well above states like NSW and Victoria, where disclosure is compulsory for amounts above $1000. This leaves us unable to identify the sources of vast amounts of money being funnelled to political parties. The Grattan Institute last year estimated hidden sources gave major political parties more than $62m, about 30-40% of total donations. </p> <p>The technology is available to easily institute real-time disclosures. Polling also shows widespread public support for real-time disclosures. All that\u2019s needed is political will. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-16T04:29:31.423Z\">at 5.29am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d7f0e798f08f9df5bdd510d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/paul-karp\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-16T04:24:48.899Z\">5.24am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Labor\u2019s second Senate question time sortee is also directed at Liberal MP <strong>Gladys Liu</strong> - questioning why <strong>Scott Morrison </strong>has not said she is a \u201cfit and proper\u201d person to sit in parliament.</p> <p>In response, Cormann repeated several times that the prime minister has \u201cfull confidence\u201d in Liu.

I have been in a position where I have been opposed to my own party at different times. These issues are normally resolved in our party room; at other times they become more public. What are our responsibilities? I know I\u2019ve got a responsibility to the people who put me in the place\u2014the electors of Monash and my party, those who work hard in the Liberal party right across the electorate of Monash and decide to support me into this place at each election campaign. And I have a responsibility also to the party room, which is quite separate from that again, which may have a different view to what my party members might decide is the right thing to do. And, over and above that, I have a responsibility to this parliament and the people of Australia.</p> <p>Can I act every time on my conscience, my compassion and my heart over what my head wants to do? No, I can\u2019t. There are issues deserving consideration where the head must rule over the heart, because that\u2019s what the nation deserves, what the people of Australia deserve. More importantly, and over and above all those things, I offer my electorate, my party, my party room and the people of Australia my judgement on an issue. My judgement may not be in accordance with how people perceive this parliament and how it should work, and how I should just obey the command of the prime minister of the day or of my party or of the whip of the day. It\u2019s actually about the challenges we face, which I mentioned earlier. It\u2019s very, very important to me and to this nation that the right decision is made, and that right decision, in my view, in my judgement, at times may not be that of my party, of the people of Australia or of those in my electorate broadly, as a whole. That doesn\u2019t mean I step back from what I view as being the right at any given time. In essence, in the end, when it comes down to it, I always offer the people that I represent, this parliament and this nation, my judgement as an individual on any given issue.</p> <p>Having said that, it doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m about to move in any particular direction. But for those who have deigned to offer their advice to me in very strong terms: I need to explain to you that this is the position I take. Many members on different issues will take that stance on behalf of their community sometimes, when they need to represent their community in a fullsome way because their constituents are directly affected by an individual matter. These issues are important, and when it comes to matters of principle where you have taken a stand for a long time, I don\u2019t believe the nation wants members of parliament who say one thing on Monday and then, under pressure, say another thing on Friday. It doesn\u2019t mean a member of parliament can\u2019t be advised, for instance, over embryonic stem cell research, where I had a conservative position until my genuine staff at the time said, \u2018Before you take that decision, let\u2019s go talk to the experts.\u2019 After I did I changed my position and supported the legislation in this House on embryonic stem cell research. It gained me a lot of criticism from other areas at the time, but it was the right decision. In the long run, the first position I took was proved wrong and the position I took after further information was right. It\u2019s not that we do not have a position to change our mind on a particular principle; we have. But it is important. In this parliament, in this place, principles are important. The practices of the parliament are important, the rule of law is important, and what surrounds that rule of law is important.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-16T02:37:24.293Z\">at 3.37am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d7ef0d88f08f9df5bdd5071\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-16T02:18:54.338Z\">3.18am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Companies can speak up about social issues, BCA head <strong>Jennifer Westacott </strong>has told ABC radio - but they should also be speaking up about the economy.</p> <p>That\u2019s a clarification of the comments reported in the Australian.</p> <p>As AAP reports:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Companies should be free to speak out about social issues, but the business lobby also wants them to speak out about the economy.</p> <p>Business Council of Australia chief executive Jennifer Westacott says firms can do both.</p> <p>\u201cMany companies feel strongly about (social) issues, and their employees expect them to stand up for them, that\u2019s perfectly legitimate,\u201d she told ABC radio on Monday.</p> <p>\u201cBut at the same time we need companies speaking out on economic issues and we need them to be signalling the virtue of being successful, of creating jobs, of paying people wages, of expanding.</p> <p>\u201cBoth of those things are not in conflict.\u201d</p> <p>The Business Council is in Canberra to speak to MPs about making business conditions easier in the face of sluggish retail spending.</p> <p>\u201cI think companies have got an obligation to talk about the economy, because they employ so many people,\u201d Ms Westacott said.</p> <p>\u201cParticularly large companies, large employers, they are the people doing the hard yards on the international scene, they can see the headwinds coming in the direction of our country.</p> <p>\u201cThey can see how to make our economy more competitive, how to make it more productive, how to pay people more.\u201d</p> <p>Ms Westacott says businesses want Australian politicians to cut red tape and incentivise investment.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we do over the next 18 months will set the company up for the next 18 years,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cIf we make some wrong choices then we will be potentially condemning our country to a very long period of low growth.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not good for people\u2019s wages, it\u2019s not good for the revenues governments need to get the services people want.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d7eed2f8f0834740f3bbd7f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-16T02:04:15.086Z\">3.04am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Anyone who has criticised or made a \u2018joke\u2019 about <strong>Frank</strong> <strong>Bainimarama\u2019s </strong>traditional dress in the comment stream really needs to take a look at what they are doing and how they are coming across.</p> <p>We have been through this multiple times now.

I think the only person in this conversation who is trying to pretend that what is going on around Gladys Liu is about an entire community in Australia is <strong>Scott Morrison</strong>. That is entirely reprehensible. It is offensive and absurd and unfortunately for Scott Morrison, true to form that he has made this ridiculous smear. </p> <p>All we are asking for, all the media is asking for, all the Australian community is asking for, is an assurance from the prime minister that he hasn\u2019t put winning a marginal seat ahead of Australia\u2019s national security. All we\u2019re asking for is for Gladys Liu, as a member of parliament, to stand up in that parliament and give a complete statement. The time for prime ministerial ducking and weaving is over. The time for Gladys Liu avoiding her parliamentary responsibilities with a full statement is over.

The economy is slowing not because business leaders have a view about social issues; the economy is slowing because the Morrison government doesn\u2019t have a plan to turn things around.</p> <p>Every day as they try to point the finger and try to shift the blame there\u2019s a new target. Sometimes it\u2019s business leaders, sometimes it\u2019s GetUp, sometimes it\u2019s the unions. Almost always it\u2019s the Labor party, sometimes it\u2019s the states. These characters never take responsibility for the fact that the economy is growing at its slowest pace in 10 years, household debt is at record highs, Australians are struggling under the rising cost of living, wages are stagnant. The list goes on and on and on. </p> <p>Australians need a government 100% focused on them, on the economy, on living standards, on cost of living pressures, on stagnant wages. Instead they have a government 100% focussed on shifting the blame and picking fights to distract from their failures on the economy. </p> <p>Now the mainstream view of many employers around the country, is that Australia does need responsible and affordable stimulus to get the economy going again. The government doesn\u2019t have to choose between a surplus and some responsible stimulus. The budget should, if anything, be strengthened by the fact that higher resource prices and a lower dollar have bolstered profits and the budget bottom line. So the government doesn\u2019t have to choose between surplus and stimulus. It\u2019s possible in the current circumstances for the</p> <p>Government to do both. We call on them to come up with a plan to turn the floundering economy around, come up with a plan to responsibly and affordably stimulate the economy so that we get wages and living standards going again. So we can turn around an economy which is floundering on the Liberals\u2019 watch. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-15T23:26:51.678Z\">at 12.26am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d7ec6fa8f08f30dc5bbbf2b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-15T23:23:21.498Z\">12.23am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Business Council of Australia head, <strong>Jennifer Westacott</strong>, has told the Australian that businesses need to think about their involvement in \u201cactivist\u201d campaigns. <a href=\"https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/bca-time-to-get-back-to-business/news-story/a54e3d010adf8d71c777f40e1bfd3e19\">From the report:</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The key is to get the balance right between those things that people who work in companies expect their CEOs to talk about, but making sure we never take our eye off the real virtue of business, which is the jobs we create, the contractors we create, the small businesses we create, the shareholders we pay,\u201d Westacott told the Australian.</p> <p>\u201cWe should make a virtue of being profitable companies.

It is party room and caucus meeting day tomorrow, so that should be fun. Plus, Frank Bainimarama will probably have some things to say about climate change. Plus, there is big stick legislation, and who doesn\u2019t get excited about a big stick? Who knows where the Gladys Liu story will go tomorrow, if anywhere. And will we ever find out why Bob Katter covered his face? Find out by tuning in tomorrow to latest episode of the 46th parliament. A very big thank you to Mike Bowers and to the whole Guardian brains trust for everything they do to keep this blog up and running. Big shout out to our tech people, who managed to fix the internet issues which have been driving me absolutely bonkers these past few sitting days. We will be back early tomorrow morning. Enjoy your evening and please \u2013 take care of you. Meanwhile, Nick Douros, a former ACT Young Labor president who resigned as a federal staffer because he was found to have bullied a fellow member has been appointed national secretary for Australian Young Labor. He was elected at the AYL conference over the weekend, despite an internal party investigation finding in February that he had contravened the party\u2019s code of conduct for bullying a female party member and calling her a \u201crat\u201d during a preselection battle for Canberra\u2019s three federal House of Representative seats. More question time from Mike Bowers: This Royal Tenenbaums reboot looks like a bust: Things none of us can explain in this place, episode #409,765: This also happened during the weekend Nationals party conference (I guess George Christensen isn\u2019t aware of peer reviews): Labor is concerned by the motion passed at the Nationals\u2019 Federal Council calling for a national science watchdog to oversee scientific papers. The member for Dawson, George Christensen, moved the motion calling for the watchdog to provide \u201cquality assurance and verification of scientific papers which are used to influence, formulate or determine public policy.\u201d Having already cut investment to science, research and innovation, Labor is concerned this is an attempt by the Government to undermine the integrity of peer review with political intervention and also an escalation of the government\u2019s War on Science. At a time when the Great Barrier Reef is dying, threatening both ecosystems and the tourism jobs it sustains, Labor is concerned such a watchdog would be used for political purposes. While we don\u2019t have details of the composition of the watchdog, science and research does not need a minister with an ideological bent, or a highly subjective panel, dictating without explanation the legitimacy of a peer reviewed researcher. The Australian Research Council (ARC) already has one of the most rigorous and comprehensive peer review process in the world when it comes to reviewing research grant applications. This recent Australian National Audit Office audit of the ARC concluded that the ARC\u2019s administration of its grants program is effective, and the guidelines align with the government\u2019s research and innovation objectives. In rare exceptions where a minister vetoes a grant, they should be required to publicly and transparently explain their decision. Crossbench senators Rex Patrick and Jacqui Lambie have issued a pointed warning to embattled construction unionist John Setka, who reportedly told a union meeting that there would be \u201cconsequences\u201d for senators who vote with the government to facilitate deregistration of unions. Patrick said that Centre Alliance and Lambie are giving \u201ccareful consideration\u201d to a range of responses including referring the matter to the privileges committee, police, or inviting Setka to explain the comments to a Senate committee, explaining they will \u201clikely\u201d respond with a combination of all three. Lambie said it was \u201ccompletely inappropriate\u201d to seek to influence a vote through violence or intimidation. \u201cThe comments are entirely beyond the pale. Politics can be brutal but should never become violent ... To John: I can only appeal to whatever is left of your sense of honour and decency, and call on you to do what is plainly in the interests of your members to stand down and resign.\u201d And question time ends. It now looks like Bob Katter has left the chamber. Bob Katter has kept his head in his hands, covering his face, for about three minutes now. This is the exact reaction I have after a bad haircut, and I can tell you, it does not work. People still know who you are. Ayes - 73 Noes - 64 That\u2019s to no longer hear Anthony Albanese. Tony Burke attempts to second. \u201cWhen he opens his mouth it is opposite day. Opposite day every single time,\u201d he says. He is also shut down. A new division (to no longer hear him) is called. But Scott Morrison has opened his mouth today. So if it *is* opposite day, do the ayes really mean nays? Bob Katter, who voted with Labor in the last division, is now sitting next to Gladys Liu in this division, clutching his head, Katharine Murphy tells us. Trying to understand Katter is one of the great mysteries of life. Seconded. Here\u2019s the original motion: That the House: (1) notes: (a) the Prime Minister has refused to sack the Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction despite the Minister admitting on radio he was acting for private interests instead of the public interest and despite the Minister\u2019s clear and repeated breaches of the Prime Minister\u2019s Ministerial Standards; (b) the Prime Minister has prevented the Member for Chisholm from providing a full statement in her own words to this House where words carry consequences and instead relied on a statement prepared by the Prime Minister\u2019s Office issued outside the House; (c) on Friday, the Prime Minister denied using the phrase \u201cShanghai Sam\u201d despite using it at least 17 times, including twice in the House; and (d) the Prime Minister\u2019s attempt to cover up his untruth on Friday with another untruth is just the latest in a long line of misdirection and obfuscation from this Prime Minister; and (2) therefore, condemns this Prime Minister for repeatedly abandoning any sense of integrity whenever it is politically expedient for him to do so. This suspension of standing orders appears to be on not just Gladys Liu, but Angus Taylor, his use of \u2018Shanghai Sam\u2019 and then his explanation. tl;dr - Labor is attempting to suspend standing orders so it can condemn the prime minister. Christian Porter shuts him down. We now have a division on Albanese no longer being heard. Anthony Albanese is moving to suspend standing orders. TWICE IN ONE DAY It\u2019s time for your daily dose of \u2018unions are terrible\u2019, with Christian Porter. Carry yourself with the confidence of a Christian Porter. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: My question is again to the prime minister and I again refer to his previous answers. Is the reason he used the phrase Shanghai Sam 17 times the same reason he supported weakening protections against racist hate speech and university level English testing for new citizens? Scott Morrison goes to read from a transcript, which sends Labor into hysterics, given his attack on Albanese, not three minutes ago, which included this: ....Pouring over transcripts, worrying about this word and this word. This country is in drought! Facing natural disasters, severe economic challenges, the leader of the opposition is running around like a researcher looking up words! Grow up! But to this answer: The leader of the opposition once said at the National Press Club, he said this... ...Talking about serious people, serious times. I\u2019m not going to table it, he gets enough publicity carrying on about this every single day, I am asked about the government and its views on the integrity of the immigration system in the rules we imply, rules we impose to make sure the surety of that system and to ensure cohesion in Australian society. Our government makes no apology for our policies when it comes to the integrity of the immigration system, no apologies for the work we have done on border protection that has kept the borders that you and make sure all Australians can have confidence in an immigration system that has made this country the most effective and most successful immigration nation on earth. Multicultural Australia... ...I was about to speak about the importance of multiculturalism in Australia, we have the most successful multicultural record of any nation today. The policy we have pursued as a government can only make that stronger. We will continue to make them stronger. ....On the first matter the member raised, the reason we have foreign interference laws in Australia, is because of the former Senator bestiary and the Labor party should well know that, their record on this issue is a shambles, they can try and distract attention from their own woes, whether it is because of the New South Wales ALP branch of the Labor party and their bags of cash, or the disastrous role of the former Senator Dastyari and how he had to resign because of his own actions. They can run but they cannot hide from what the Labor leader of New South Wales said, before the last state election, that Asians would take Australian jobs. Angus Taylor says some things. Moving on. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: My question is again to the Prime Minister, I refer to his previous answer, in a statement to the media he said he had not used any of those phrases. If one of the phrases he thought he had been asked about was an accusation something was racist, what was the other phrase if it wasn\u2019t Shanghai Sam? Morrison: Mr Speaker, I refer again... I refer the Member to my earlier answer. The phrase racist was used twice in the question, that\u2019s what I heard and that is what I was referring to. Mr Speaker, if the Leader of the Opposition, honestly thinks, that this, this is the best he can do, last week the Leader of the Opposition came up here and did something, Mr Speaker the Leader of the Opposition really does unless he thinks he has locked it up when they call on me to have one of my members resigned. You don\u2019t do that lightly. He did that in this place on one day, the next day he did not mention it. It is the weakness and lameness of this Leader of the Opposition, what is he doing all day? Pouring over transcripts, worrying about this word and this word. This country is in drought! Facing natural disasters, severe economic challenges, the Leader of the Opposition is running around like a researcher looking up words! Grow up! So we have moved from \u2018it\u2019s a grubby smear\u2019 and accusations of racism, to \u2018there are very important things happening in this country\u2019. Someone is wearing his cranky pants today. And I say that as someone who has at least four pairs a week to choose from. Karen Andrews delivered a lickspittle answer, complete with a \u2018I want to speak to the manager\u2019 finger point, and accuses the opposition of being smug. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: My question is addressed to the prime minister. Why did the prime minister deny using the praise Shanghai Sam, something he did at least 17 times, including in this House? Morrison: I understand the leader of the opposition is a busy member of parliament, he may not have had the opportunity to hear the interview I did later that afternoon, when I returned from visiting the bushfires, with the member for Wright, the question was put at the end of the press conference when I was standing next to the recovery centre, I heard the word racism used twice and that question is what I was referring to. If the best the leader of the opposition can drum up, is that withering attack, then I\u2019m sure there is a lot of optimistic people that sit on the back bench of the Labor Party that see a big opportunity for themselves.\u201d There\u2019s a whole 30 minutes left in this hour. Aren\u2019t we lucky? As Australia burns, Angus Taylor asks Labor if they are \u201cfor or against\u201d coal. Fantastic. Great move. Well done Angus. Scott Morrison: I tabled the document because I undertook to do so outside of this place at a press conference, and I always follow through on my word. Tony Burke to Scott Morrison: I refer to his tabling of the written statement by the member for Chisholm during question time last week. During that answer, was he aware that by tabling the statement instead of having the member speak directly to the house, the house would be prevented from holding him to account for any inaccuracies in the statement? Why did he take that action rather than let the member stand in Parliament and make a statement in her own words? Christian Porter: For a start, it contains imputations about inaccuracies without identifying any, and secondly the standing orders are not inside the responsibilities of the prime minister. Tony Smith: I\u2019m going to hear from the manager of opposition business. Burke: Both in the preamble and quite specifically on the question at the end, I have asked about an answer that the prime minister gave in the house and why he gave it in a particular way. Smith: The point that the manager of opposition business makes I think is right. The question is about an action the prime minister took during question time in answer to a question last week, so for me to prevent questioning of something the prime minister had said in an answer, I don\u2019t think that would be right. I\u2019m going to call the prime minister. Do we have a \u2018parliamentary friends of banning the phrase the reality is\u2019 yet, and if not, why not? Centre Alliance is pushing for a significant overhaul of Australia\u2019s objectively terrible donation disclosure laws. Crossbench MP Rebekha Sharkie introduced a draft bill to the lower house this morning that would compel political parties to disclose donations within five days. This would effectively enforce the real-time declaration of disclosures and mirror arrangements in place at a state level in Queensland and Victoria. The bill has a difficult path before it. But if nothing else, this latest reform attempt reminds us of the parlous state of funding transparency in Australian politics. Currently, we only find out who has donated to political parties once a year in February. That means the public won\u2019t find out who bankrolled the Labor and Liberal election campaigns until nine months after the fact. Even then, parties are only required to disclose donations above $14,000, a threshold well above states like NSW and Victoria, where disclosure is compulsory for amounts above $1000. This leaves us unable to identify the sources of vast amounts of money being funnelled to political parties. The Grattan Institute last year estimated hidden sources gave major political parties more than $62m, about 30-40% of total donations. The technology is available to easily institute real-time disclosures. Polling also shows widespread public support for real-time disclosures. All that\u2019s needed is political will. Labor\u2019s second Senate question time sortee is also directed at Liberal MP Gladys Liu - questioning why Scott Morrison has not said she is a \u201cfit and proper\u201d person to sit in parliament. In response, Cormann repeated several times that the prime minister has \u201cfull confidence\u201d in Liu. He accused Labor of \u201ctrickery\u201d by suggesting that Liu is a spy. \u201cYou\u2019re not naming it, you\u2019re not saying it, but that\u2019s what you\u2019re trying to spread,\u201d he said. Cormann dismissed quotes of concerns from unnamed Liberals as sour grapes from people who lost preselection contests, and accused Labor of \u201cgrasping at straws\u201d. Bob Katter gets the next question: Energy minister, are you aware of the crisis in North Queensland with untenable electricity prices jeopardising $400 million a year of national income? Also will you as the grandson of the man who built the Snowy visit our triangle of power as have deputy PM Michael McCormack, as have Barnaby Joyce and Anthony Albanese? The Tully Hydro Riordan alignment, a triangle that would generate 5% of Australia\u2019s electricity, clean, cheap, renewable and forever, all dependent on the production of copper transmission lines. (In a marked departure from many of my friends from north Queensland, Katter does not end his sentences with a questioning lilt - even when they are questions. So his sitting down is often the only indication you have that he\u2019s done.) Angus Taylor says he would love to visit. And also the government is working on it. And also it is the Queensland Labor government\u2019s fault (despite the Queensland government not selling its power assets to take advantage of the Abbott-Hockey $5bn assets recycling pool). Anthony Albanese to Angus Taylor: Will the government adopt a key recommendation released today by the ACCC that the National Energy Guarantee be implemented to achieve, and I quote, the objective of reducing carbon emissions at low cost while promoting investment in a manner that ensures demand for energy is met? #WelldoneAngus He will recall that the NEG had to pass. The first part was a reliability obligation, and the ACCC tells us the Australian government has implemented the reliability components of the National Energy Guarantee. The second part, of course, of the National Energy Guarantee was the 26% emission reduction target, and we will reach that in the national electricity market, which is what it was focused on, eight to nine years ahead of schedule, by 2021 or 2022. The reason for that is very simple. We are seeing record levels of investment in solar and wind in our national electricity market right now. Three times the level per capita, on average, across the UK, France and Germany. These are record levels of investment, and we will reach our emissions target years ahead of time. More broadly across the economy we are also on target to reach our emissions obligations. Our 2020 obligations, other Kyoto obligations... Albanese asks about relevance, and Taylor is allowed to continue, but told to stick to the topic. It ends shortly afterwards. Labor has started Senate question time with questions about Liberal MP Gladys Liu and $1m of political donations she raised for the Liberal Party. Liberal leader in the Senate, Mathias Cormann replied: \u201cThe prime minister has full confidence in the member for Chisholm. Questions in relation to declaration of political donations are a matter for party organisations. The member for Chisholm has stated at all times she has complied with federal and state donation laws.\u201d Cormann dismissed the \u201congoing smear\u201d as a non-story, arguing it was hardly breaking news that a \u201clong-term member of Liberal Party has supported the Liberal Party\u201d. Penny Wong attempted to force Cormann to withdraw the suggestion Labor is engaged in a \u201csmear\u201d against a Chinese-Australian, but Senate president Scott Ryan noted that comments directed at a party (but not an individual) are not generally considered unparliamentary. In response to a supplementary, Cormann claimed that Labor backbenchers he encountered at Canberra airport told him there was \u201cconcern\u201d from opposition members about its approach to the Liu issue. Michael McCormack, fresh from his war on frogs and other pesky native animals that have the audacity to exist in areas he wants to build a road or dam (eventually, I mean, just look at the infrastructure plan - it is over 10 years), Michael McCormacks his way through another dixer. Steamed rice has more personality. Jim Chalmers (who is made to withdraw an unparliamentary comment I missed before speaking) to Scott Morrison: Prime minister, why, in this House does the prime minister ignore the seven public months, by the reserve bank governor since the election, about the need for economic stimulus and pretend they were never made. Morrison: I thank the member for the question I was just going to that point about the government fiscal policy in my response to the previous member\u2019s question. We believe it is important to maintain a surplus, that side of the House haven\u2019t seen a surplus since 1989. I have to once again remind the House of the testimony given by the governor of the reserve bank, and evidence to the house of Representatives standing committee, where he said, and I quote, if the government economy is not doing well, the global economy is not doing well we need all arms of public policy to support the Australian economy. That is not a call for the government to do what I want to be clear about. That is the statement on the 9 August by the government of reserve bank to the house of Representatives standing committee on the economy, if the Labor Party can\u2019t understand the plain English towards a committee of this House, where the governor has been crystal clear about what his view is and they want to verbal the reserve governor. This is the difference, our government understands the need to continue to show measured discipline when it comes to the managing of government finances. Those opposite were unable to do that, they settled this country up for a debt we will be paying for the next decade. When we come to this dispatch box and we say you can\u2019t manage money you can\u2019t run the country, that is what happens when they couldn\u2019t pay for pharmaceuticals, they had to tax the Australian people to respond to disasters. A lickspittle on natural disaster turns into a political attack by the government on Labor\u2019s economic record. As you do. Scott Morrison must be really, really upset by the Sharks loss, given his mood in QT this afternoon. So Asio has taken the fairly rare step of publicly speaking out against a government policy. As Paul Karp reports: Peter Dutton\u2019s citizenship-stripping laws may have thwarted police from pressing criminal charges and increased the risk of terrorism, Australia\u2019s spy agency has warned. The Australian Security and Intelligence Organisation issued the warning to an inquiry examining provisions that automatically strip dual nationals of their Australian citizenship if they engage in terrorism-related conduct. Asio has called for the powers, introduced by the Turnbull government in 2015 at the urging of Dutton, now the home affairs minister, to be replaced by an optional power to cancel citizenship only if it is in Australia\u2019s interests. It submitted that it was \u201ctoo early\u201d to determine if the laws had acted as a deterrent. It accepted that they prevented people re-entering Australia, meaning they were \u201cunable to physically execute an attack in Australia or undertake any face-to-face radicalisation, recruitment or capability transfer\u201d but said this needed to be \u201cbalanced against the security challenges arising from locating the individual offshore\u201d. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison (who is starting off very shouty) Until this year the prime minister repeatedly promised better wages under this government. Is the reason the prime minister has gone silent on that repeated promise because his government has presided over the worst wages growth on record? Morrison (but with added shouting) I remind the leader of the opposition in the most recent national accounts, real wage growth was up 0.7% through the year. If they say that is the worst on record why wasn\u2019t 0.5% through the year when we came to government? Real wages growth, and the most recent quarter is higher than the last quarter then it was in the quarter we inherited from the Labor government. I would ask the treasurer, if you would like to add further to the response, we have a plan to grow wages, and increase wages as we have seen and the overall compensation of employees grew by 5%, how is that happening? We are investing in infrastructure, expanding trade barriers, investing in skills, making sure we are giving Australians back the money they earn so they can keep more of what they earn, directing two key sectors like water, infrastructure or agribusiness, to the digital economy becoming a reality under policies of this government, which increases cash flow for small to medium-sized businesses, we are taking the regulation monkeys off their back, that is how you grow an economy, you don\u2019t grow it by putting $387 billion of higher taxes on the hard work of Australians, and the small business community of Australia.\u201d Josh Frydenberg gets up and says pretty much the same thing, but with less shouting. Perhaps he could pass on what he has learnt about microphones to the prime minister. Who is that MP? It\u2019s Lisa Chester. She asks if the Nationals MPs will be happy when non-cow\u2019s milk, milk-like product is called \u2018white liquid for your tea\u2019 after the resolution that the party will move to crack down on plant-based products being named like-animal products. He followed up with this: And let\u2019s remind everyone here that it was not Labor that began this pursuit. Labor did not make the member for Chisholm go on Sky on Tuesday night and give a disastrous interview where she contradicted long-standing bipartisan policy on China and then repeatedly gave misleading answers about her knowledge of, and association with, a number of organisations. It has been journalists and commentators, not Labor, who have been raising day after day, serious questions about the member for Chisholm. So, is the prime minister saying that Andrew Bolt was being racist when he asked the member for Chisholm whether she agreed with Australia\u2019s long standing bipartisan national policy on the South China Sea? Is the prime minister saying that it is racist to ask why the member for Chisholm falsely claimed to have nothing to do with a number of organisations that she never declared to her party, or this parliament, and which she now admits she was a senior member of? Is the prime minister saying that journalists are racist for asking whether he, and other ministers, were told by security agencies not to attend fundraising activities organised by the member for Chisholm? Is the prime minister saying that Andrew Bolt is racist for posing a series of perfectly reasonable questions in the Herald-Sun newspaper just today? Questions such as: \uf0b7 Why did the member for Chisholm first say she couldn\u2019t remember being a member of (the Guangdong chapter of the China Overseas Exchange Association) then deny it, and the next day, when she was caught out, finally admit it? \uf0b7 Why did the member for Chisholm, in her application to be a Liberal candidate, list her membership of 17 community groups \u2014 from the Box Hill Chess Club to Rotary \u2014 but not her links to at least four organisations tied to China\u2019s United Front Work Department? \uf0b7 How did the member for Chisholm, when not yet even a candidate, manage to raise more than $1 million for the Liberals? \uf0b7 Why did ASIO\u2019s boss reportedly warn then prime minister Malcolm Turnbull against going to a meeting the member for Chisholm arranged with her donors? Those are Andrew Bolt\u2019s questions in The Herald-Sun today. If, as has been reported, our agencies did issue warnings about the member for Chisholm, would that have been racist? If you want to know where question time is going to be going today (at least as far as I can guess) I would say these parts of Mark Dreyfus\u2019 speech on the latest attempt to suspend standing orders gives an idea: This prime minister has shown himself to be very skilled at dodging questions he is frightened of. It\u2019s an \u2018on water matter so I won\u2019t answer.\u2019 \u2018It\u2019s a bubble question so I won\u2019t answer.\u2019 \u2018It\u2019s a question I answered yesterday so I won\u2019t answer\u2019, even when it turns out he never did answer that question the day before. And now he\u2019s at it again \u2013 he says he can\u2019t answer these important questions, this time it\u2019s because he\u2019s claiming, in a display as cynically self-serving as it is dishonest, that anyone asking those questions about safeguarding our national security must be a racist. I want to be very clear: the ONLY person linking these questions to the issue of race, and in the process smearing the entire Chinese-Australian community, and also people on his own side concerned about issues of national security, is this prime minister. That same prime minister who, in 2017, on no fewer than 17 occasions, used the offensive slogan \u201cShanghai Sam\u201d. The same prime minister who denied ever using the phrase, despite posting video of himself saying it to his own Twitter and Facebook accounts with the caption \u201cShanghai Sam\u201d! If harm is being done here, it\u2019s being done by this desperate and wounded prime minister, as slippery as he\u2019s ever been, trying to blame everyone but himself. In a somewhat rare divisional appearance, Bob Katter voted with Labor on that one (as did Adam Bandt, Rebekha Sharkie, Zali Steggall and Helen Haines). That division was won by the government 69 to 72. Moving on to 90 second statements. Also known as time-to-eat-before-QT. Christian Porter is not in favour of the suspension. The division bells are rung. \u201cPrime minister, this is not going away, and no attempt at this fruitless smear, will make it go away,\u201d Mark Dreyfus says, adding that the bulk of the questions have been driven by the media, not Labor. Scott Morrison tabled the statement Gladys Liu put out through her office in the last sitting day, last week, but it is not counted as a statement to parliament. This will take us up until question time. Which, given this motion, is probably going to be more on the same topic. Here is the motion Mark Dreyfus is on his feet, asking the House to suspend standing orders so it can discuss Gladys Liu. This is fine. And for those wanting context, it followed this article in The Conversation. Just now while I remember it (I have only just got around to looking through the Hansard) here is the full text of the speech Russell Broadbent gave at the end of the sitting last week: This job can be challenging. I have been in a position where I have been opposed to my own party at different times. These issues are normally resolved in our party room; at other times they become more public. What are our responsibilities? I know I\u2019ve got a responsibility to the people who put me in the place\u2014the electors of Monash and my party, those who work hard in the Liberal party right across the electorate of Monash and decide to support me into this place at each election campaign. And I have a responsibility also to the party room, which is quite separate from that again, which may have a different view to what my party members might decide is the right thing to do. And, over and above that, I have a responsibility to this parliament and the people of Australia. Can I act every time on my conscience, my compassion and my heart over what my head wants to do? No, I can\u2019t. There are issues deserving consideration where the head must rule over the heart, because that\u2019s what the nation deserves, what the people of Australia deserve. More importantly, and over and above all those things, I offer my electorate, my party, my party room and the people of Australia my judgement on an issue. My judgement may not be in accordance with how people perceive this parliament and how it should work, and how I should just obey the command of the prime minister of the day or of my party or of the whip of the day. It\u2019s actually about the challenges we face, which I mentioned earlier. It\u2019s very, very important to me and to this nation that the right decision is made, and that right decision, in my view, in my judgement, at times may not be that of my party, of the people of Australia or of those in my electorate broadly, as a whole. That doesn\u2019t mean I step back from what I view as being the right at any given time. In essence, in the end, when it comes down to it, I always offer the people that I represent, this parliament and this nation, my judgement as an individual on any given issue. Having said that, it doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m about to move in any particular direction. But for those who have deigned to offer their advice to me in very strong terms: I need to explain to you that this is the position I take. Many members on different issues will take that stance on behalf of their community sometimes, when they need to represent their community in a fullsome way because their constituents are directly affected by an individual matter. These issues are important, and when it comes to matters of principle where you have taken a stand for a long time, I don\u2019t believe the nation wants members of parliament who say one thing on Monday and then, under pressure, say another thing on Friday. It doesn\u2019t mean a member of parliament can\u2019t be advised, for instance, over embryonic stem cell research, where I had a conservative position until my genuine staff at the time said, \u2018Before you take that decision, let\u2019s go talk to the experts.\u2019 After I did I changed my position and supported the legislation in this House on embryonic stem cell research. It gained me a lot of criticism from other areas at the time, but it was the right decision. In the long run, the first position I took was proved wrong and the position I took after further information was right. It\u2019s not that we do not have a position to change our mind on a particular principle; we have. But it is important. In this parliament, in this place, principles are important. The practices of the parliament are important, the rule of law is important, and what surrounds that rule of law is important. Companies can speak up about social issues, BCA head Jennifer Westacott has told ABC radio - but they should also be speaking up about the economy. That\u2019s a clarification of the comments reported in the Australian. As AAP reports: Companies should be free to speak out about social issues, but the business lobby also wants them to speak out about the economy. Business Council of Australia chief executive Jennifer Westacott says firms can do both. \u201cMany companies feel strongly about (social) issues, and their employees expect them to stand up for them, that\u2019s perfectly legitimate,\u201d she told ABC radio on Monday. \u201cBut at the same time we need companies speaking out on economic issues and we need them to be signalling the virtue of being successful, of creating jobs, of paying people wages, of expanding. \u201cBoth of those things are not in conflict.\u201d The Business Council is in Canberra to speak to MPs about making business conditions easier in the face of sluggish retail spending. \u201cI think companies have got an obligation to talk about the economy, because they employ so many people,\u201d Ms Westacott said. \u201cParticularly large companies, large employers, they are the people doing the hard yards on the international scene, they can see the headwinds coming in the direction of our country. \u201cThey can see how to make our economy more competitive, how to make it more productive, how to pay people more.\u201d Ms Westacott says businesses want Australian politicians to cut red tape and incentivise investment. \u201cWhat we do over the next 18 months will set the company up for the next 18 years,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we make some wrong choices then we will be potentially condemning our country to a very long period of low growth. \u201cThat\u2019s not good for people\u2019s wages, it\u2019s not good for the revenues governments need to get the services people want.\u201d Anyone who has criticised or made a \u2018joke\u2019 about Frank Bainimarama\u2019s traditional dress in the comment stream really needs to take a look at what they are doing and how they are coming across. We have been through this multiple times now. Stop it. Bainimarama: Thank you, Mr Prime Minister. Prime minister, I look forward to advancing the respect and openness that has and must continue to define our engagement between our governments. We will only have the chance to speak one-on-one and talk through some pressings ahead of this official bilateral meeting. Neither of us baulk at speaking our minds, and I believe we both hold a clear view of our priorities and a shared understanding of how we can live up to the high aspirations of the partnership. In Fiji, the partnership means family. For Fijians the bonds that binds families together are a sacred, unbreakable connection. It\u2019s about more than being good mates to one another. It\u2019s about the connection, it demands a level of understanding unprecedented in the relations between our governments but has been long evidenced in the general affinity shared by the Fijian and the Australian people. Members of any family are entitled to their disagreements. No-one expects that our differences can be resolved quickly or easily, but we must never fall down in forging common ground and common ground is what I intend to seek in our discussion on the issues that impact the lives of Fijians, Australians and all the Pacific people this morning. Mr Prime Minister, as I said to you before we came in, I - I was hoping that I\u2019d be at the grounds watching the Fijians kick the Welsh out! In what is always a totally normal and natural way to hold a conversation (it must be done, but it is always so awkward) Scott Morrison and Frank Bainimarama have said their official hellos in front of the cameras. Morrison: Prime minister, it\u2019s wonderful to welcome you here to Australia as an official guest of government. It was wonderful to stand by your side this morning as you were - you received the Federation Guard and were able to inspect the guard in the most important places of Australia, looking out on the War Memorial and to be the prime minister who was able to welcome you here in this special way and to acknowledge the great friendship that Australia and Fiji has, but the great friendship that you and I have built up. It\u2019s a great pleasure to be Australia\u2019s first prime minister to go to Fiji on a bilateral visit, it was a surprise to me it has taken so long, but you said, I remember on that night - many invitations have been offered and this one has been accepted and I was very pleased to accept it and join you and Mary in Finland but today to be able to welcome you here and to be with you yesterday, I think, has been very special as part of our partnership and the work that we begun when I was in Suva with you and we will bring to completion today after this meeting as we sign the partnership. The thing I love about how we have expressed it, it\u2019s a term of intimacy, it\u2019s a term of family and that\u2019s very much has always been the basis of our relationship. The people-to-people relationships, the strategic relationships, the economic partnerships, they\u2019re not new, they go back many, many, many generations, and for whatever other complexities there are in the world today, one certainty is the relationship that exists between the people of Australia and the people of Fiji. And I think that will always endure. It is just too familiar, it is too close and will always be enduring. I want to thank you and all of your delegation, a very large delegation, who has been able to come to Australia. I look forward to the discussions we\u2019re about to have on many issues and thank you for the discussions that we have just had between us ourselves as leaders. I want to thank you for your leadership in the Pacific, the Pacific is a place that we have great passion about and particularly with yourself as a key leader in the Pacific, and standing up for the Pacific, and the interest of the Pacific peoples, not just the peoples of Fiji, I think has shown tremendous leadership and we want to acknowledge that here as well. I look forward to those discussions and I thank you for your accepting our invitation to be here on this occasion. It\u2019s a very important day, I know, in our relationship but also between our two countries. Meanwhile, in the Senate: Scott Morrison and Frank Bainimarama are holding their bilateral meeting in the cabinet room right now. Mike Bowers tells me it was a full room. But deputy prime minister Michael McCormack was not there. It couldn\u2019t at all be because he said this not so long ago: \u201cI also get a little bit annoyed when we have people in those sorts of countries pointing the finger at Australia and say we should be shutting down all our resources sector so that, you know, they will continue to survive,\u201d he said. \u201cThey will continue to survive, there\u2019s no question they\u2019ll continue to survive and they\u2019ll continue to survive on large aid assistance from Australia. \u201cThey\u2019ll continue to survive because many of their workers come here and pick our fruit, pick our fruit grown with hard Australian enterprise and endeavour and we welcome them and we always will. \u201cBut the fact is we\u2019re not going to be hijacked into doing something that will shut down an industry that provides tens of thousands of jobs, that provides two-thirds of our energy needs ... and I\u2019m only talking coal, let alone all of our other resources.\u201d But he apologised if anyone took offence, so cool beans. Guardian Australia understands that the electoral law challenges against treasurer Josh Frydenberg and embattled Liberal MP Gladys Liu alleging misleading conduct in the election over Chinese-language signs have been listed in the court of disputed returns on Wednesday in Melbourne. These are just directions hearings - so they will iron out practical details about when the final hearing will be held, whether the high court will handball the case to the federal court or who on the high court will hear it - but we won\u2019t hear substantive arguments. I don\u2019t believe the separate Michael Staindl section 44 challenge against Frydenberg is listed. I think we all know how this will go. Bill Shorten tells Sky that it would be \u201carrogant\u201d for the party not to review it\u2019s policies, given the election loss. Bill Shorten is speaking to Annelise Nielsen in the Sky studio in Canberra, from his office in Canberra. Which is a little strange, given the studio is just a short walk away. The last time Shorten was in a studio in Canberra, he was bombarded with journalist\u2019s questions in the hallway as he left (press gallery hallways are one of the only places we can ask questions). Shorten supports the call from disability advocates for Barbara Bennett and John Ryan to stand down from the disability royal commission over conflict of interest concerns. The first public sitting of the royal commission into abuse of people with disabilities is being held in Brisbane today. Some advocates have announced they will boycott the commission because of their concerns. Nothing like an official parliamentary welcome to let you know what it would sound like if parliament was under attack. Seems a bit early for the Yelp review, though. Confirmed: raptors are narks. And for more on why we are looking at four-year terms, here is the official release: Should Australia move to fixed four-year parliamentary terms? A parliamentary committee will hold a roundtable discussion on this topic on Thursday 7 November 2019, and has invited questions and views from the public. Andrew Wallace MP, chair of the House Social Policy and Legal Affairs Committee, says the Australian Parliament\u2019s House of Representatives is the only lower house in the country with three-year parliamentary terms. \u201cFour-year terms could address the community\u2019s concerns about the revolving doors of politicians and policy by providing more stability and opportunities for longer-term outcomes,\u201d Wallace said. \u201cAll of our state and territory parliaments have four-year lower house terms, with Queensland moving to four-year terms in 2020 following a successful referendum in 2016. \u201cOn the other hand, there may be downsides to fixed parliamentary terms. Current events in the United Kingdom show that this issue is one that needs careful consideration.\u201d The roundtable will consist of a panel of constitutional experts including laureate professor emeritus Cheryl Saunders, professor Gabrielle Appleby, professor Anne Twomey and professor George Williams. \u201cAny change to parliamentary terms would require popular support from voters, so we\u2019re offering voters the opportunity to be involved in the process from the very beginning,\u201d Wallace said. The roundtable will be open to the public and streamed live on the parliament\u2019s website. You can participate by submitting your questions and views via the roundtable website. The committee will also consider questions posted live on Twitter on the day of the roundtable. The House\u2019s Twitter account, @AbouttheHouse, will post live commentary from the event. Following the roundtable, the committee intends to present a short report to the House reflecting the issues discussed. For more information go to the committee\u2019s website. The only acceptable answer to this question, is yes. Then we will all know when the election is and not have to spend 18 months waiting for the call. But if you want to have your say, head to the committee page. Gladys Liu is still a top of conversation. Jim Chalmers says Labor just wants her to give a statement to parliament clearing up some of the issues: Every day there are new questions raised by the media about the affiliations and actions and donations involved with Gladys Liu. Every day the prime minister tries to duck and weave from these questions. Every day he tries to evade responsibility for what\u2019s going on here. We call on the prime minister and Gladys Liu to come clean on these donations and these affiliations. The best place for Gladys Liu to do that is in the parliament. She needs to make a full, complete statement about what\u2019s gone on here. Remember that this prime minister may have put winning a marginal seat ahead of Australia\u2019s national security and that\u2019s a very, very serious thing if it\u2019s true. So we do need to get to the bottom of it. Scott Morrison needs to stop ducking and weaving, and Gladys Liu needs to front up to the parliament and make a complete statement about what\u2019s gone on. Question: Do you think it\u2019s rubbish that the government is saying that this is a racist attack? Jim Chalmers: I do. I think the only person in this conversation who is trying to pretend that what is going on around Gladys Liu is about an entire community in Australia is Scott Morrison. That is entirely reprehensible. It is offensive and absurd and unfortunately for Scott Morrison, true to form that he has made this ridiculous smear. All we are asking for, all the media is asking for, all the Australian community is asking for, is an assurance from the prime minister that he hasn\u2019t put winning a marginal seat ahead of Australia\u2019s national security. All we\u2019re asking for is for Gladys Liu, as a member of parliament, to stand up in that parliament and give a complete statement. The time for prime ministerial ducking and weaving is over. The time for Gladys Liu avoiding her parliamentary responsibilities with a full statement is over. We need to get assurances that Scott Morrison hasn\u2019t put winning a marginal seat ahead of national security in this country. The Australian Farm Institute will launch a report calling for a national strategy on climate change and agriculture today. About 20 farmers will arrive at parliament to discuss the report with environment minister Sussan Ley. The bells are ringing (and the guns have officially saluted Frank Bainimarama) so GET EXCITED. Mark Butler has responded to the ACCC\u2019s second report into energy affordability: Labor welcomes the slim reductions through the ACCC recommendation of a default market offer, a policy Labor adopted before the Coalition. However, as the ACCC notes, the default offers will only apply to less than 10% of households. What the ACCC have specifically called out is the government\u2019s lack of national energy policy which would reduce power prices, ensure reliability and bring down emissions, \u201cThe Australian Competition and Consumer Commission restates its support for the National Energy Guarantee as a settled policy framework.\u201d Angus Taylor has failed to live up to Scott Morrison\u2019s KPI as minister for lower power prices; analysis from JP Morgan shows under the Morrison government\u2019s energy crisis wholesale electricity prices across the four NEM states \u2013 Victoria, South Australia, NSW and Queensland \u2013 rose to $83/MWh in August, up 12% from June despite lower demand. And prices are set to continue to rise; forward prices are now 29% higher than a year ago, averaging $94/MWh. Ever since the Liberals\u2019 energy crisis started in 2015, wholesale electricity prices have risen 158%. Speaking of China, Kerry Stokes, the chairman of Seven West, among a bunch of other businesses, told the Weekend Australian that Scott Morrison needed to visit: \u201cAustralia\u2019s entire future is based on our ability to trade and China is our largest trading partner, Mr Stokes, the executive chairman of the Seven Group, said. \u201cOur whole standard of living is virtually determined by the exports we make to China.\u201d It\u2019s a little hard without an invitation though. An Australian prime minister has not visited China since 2016, although there have been sideline chats at events like the G20. Remember this story from 8 February 2019, before the election: Australia\u2019s security agencies are urgently investigating an attempt to hack the federal parliament\u2019s computer network, with the parliament unable to rule out a foreign government being behind the attack. In a joint statement, Scott Ryan and Tony Smith \u2013 parliament\u2019s presiding officers \u2013 reported a \u201csecurity incident on the parliamentary computing network\u201d occurred overnight and into Friday morning. No data breach has been reported, and they said all passwords had been reset out of \u201can abundance of caution\u201d. Well Reuters has just released this report: Australian intelligence determined China was responsible for a cyber-attack on its national parliament and three largest political parties before the general election in May, five people with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters. Australia\u2019s cyber intelligence agency \u2013 the Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) \u2013 concluded in March that China\u2019s Ministry of State Security was responsible for the attack, the five people with direct knowledge of the findings of the investigation told Reuters. The five sources declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the issue. Reuters has not reviewed the classified report. Jim Chalmers dropped by doors to give Labor\u2019s message for the day: The Liberal government is into its seventh year and into its third term, and the defining feature of that government is that they\u2019re always looking for fights to distract from their failures on the economy. The economy is slowing not because business leaders have a view about social issues; the economy is slowing because the Morrison government doesn\u2019t have a plan to turn things around. Every day as they try to point the finger and try to shift the blame there\u2019s a new target. Sometimes it\u2019s business leaders, sometimes it\u2019s GetUp, sometimes it\u2019s the unions. Almost always it\u2019s the Labor party, sometimes it\u2019s the states. These characters never take responsibility for the fact that the economy is growing at its slowest pace in 10 years, household debt is at record highs, Australians are struggling under the rising cost of living, wages are stagnant. The list goes on and on and on. Australians need a government 100% focused on them, on the economy, on living standards, on cost of living pressures, on stagnant wages. Instead they have a government 100% focussed on shifting the blame and picking fights to distract from their failures on the economy. Now the mainstream view of many employers around the country, is that Australia does need responsible and affordable stimulus to get the economy going again. The government doesn\u2019t have to choose between a surplus and some responsible stimulus. The budget should, if anything, be strengthened by the fact that higher resource prices and a lower dollar have bolstered profits and the budget bottom line. So the government doesn\u2019t have to choose between surplus and stimulus. It\u2019s possible in the current circumstances for the Government to do both. We call on them to come up with a plan to turn the floundering economy around, come up with a plan to responsibly and affordably stimulate the economy so that we get wages and living standards going again. So we can turn around an economy which is floundering on the Liberals\u2019 watch. The Business Council of Australia head, Jennifer Westacott, has told the Australian that businesses need to think about their involvement in \u201cactivist\u201d campaigns. From the report: The key is to get the balance right between those things that people who work in companies expect their CEOs to talk about, but making sure we never take our eye off the real virtue of business, which is the jobs we create, the contractors we create, the small businesses we create, the shareholders we pay,\u201d Westacott told the Australian. \u201cWe should make a virtue of being profitable companies. I think there is absolutely a virtuous circle of well-run companies, ethically managed companies, making good profits, paying their shareholders, employing their people, paying them more. \u201cThat is the virtuous circle of business, which of course is the employer of 11 million people. This is not an abstract concept.\u201d The thing with business though, is that they don\u2019t do anything that won\u2019t actually help their bottom line. That\u2019s kind of their thing. So supporting social justice campaigns, or moving into a more energy-efficient space has to work for them on some level. But they could always just go back to their knitting. Meanwhile, there are warnings that the price of oil is about to increase after the drone attack on one of Saudi Arabia\u2019s supply wells. Australia only has about 28 days worth of supply in reserve, something which the government has decided to do something about, because, well, it\u2019s not great. I have seen 28 Days Later. (If only we had some sort of policy to move us off oil-dependent vehicles or something.) Angus Taylor was asked about oil prices this morning: Well, I\u2019m not in the business of forecasting oil prices and the government isn\u2019t. That\u2019s not what we do. What we have to do, though, is make sure that we do everything in our power to make sure there\u2019s no threat to Australia\u2019s fuel supplies and we are told by the IEA [International Energy Agency] that there is no immediate threat to Australia\u2019s fuel supplies. There are ample commercial stocks globally. This is a global issue and it will impact globally, not just locally. But don\u2019t worry \u2013 the US president says everything is fine. Anthony Albanese on the \u201cbig stick\u201d legislation: We haven\u2019t seen it. It\u2019s a good idea for public policy, to see legislation before you decide whether you\u2019re for it or against it. But, I\u2019ve got to say, the starting point is the title which is Orwellian. This is a government that doesn\u2019t have a policy on climate change or energy, and has come up with a rather juvenile term, to be frank, of calling legislation \u201cbig stick\u201d legislation. I mean we\u2019re meant to be adults. And the problem for this government is that it doesn\u2019t have the maturity as a political organisation to actually come together with a coherent policy. Of course that means we have acting prime minister Michael McCormack in our immediate futures. Frogs beware. And a statement on that visit has just landed in our inboxes from the PMO: I will travel to the United States of America with my wife Jenny, from 19-27 September, visiting Washington DC, Chicago, Ohio and New York. It was an honour to accept President Trump\u2019s generous invitation for an official visit with a state dinner at the White House. I look forward to meeting again with President Trump and members of his cabinet, including vice president Pence, secretary of state Pompeo and secretary of defense Esper to discuss how we can further strengthen our alliance and already close partnership. There is no deeper friendship than that which exists between Australia and the United States. We see the world through the same eyes, with shared values and a deep commitment to promoting peace, liberty and prosperity. This visit will be a valuable opportunity to further strengthen our security and economic partnership. Our alliance is stronger than ever \u2013 a partnership first forged on the battlefield, when we fought alongside one another at the Battle of Hamel in 1918. Since then, we have stood side by side in every major conflict since the first world war \u2013 in the defence of freedom, liberty and democracy. Our economic partnership is just as strong and this visit will further strengthen it. The United States is Australia\u2019s largest economic partner. Investment between our two nations is worth more than $1.2tn, supporting hundreds of thousands of jobs. The Australia-US Free Trade Agreement itself is a shining example of our shared commitment to economic growth and prosperity \u2013 with our two-way trade growing by almost 60% since it was signed. However, our economic partnership is more than just trade. I will visit the Nasa headquarters and welcome greater US-Australia cooperation on space, and other cutting-edge science and technology initiatives. I will also meet young Australian tech entrepreneurs working in the midwest. I also look forward to taking the opportunity while in the United States for this official visit to engage with our other partners at the 74th regular session of the general assembly at the United Nations. I will deliver Australia\u2019s national statement and advance Australia\u2019s interests in the protection of the oceans and preventing terrorist use of the internet. While in New York, I will also meet senior business representatives to further enhance the economic partnership between Australia and the United States. Scott Morrison will head to the US later this week, for an official visit for his own with Donald Trump. Trump is putting on what is only his second State Dinner since becoming president for Morrison. The US is making quite the fuss - Trump will travel with the prime minister to Ohio for a tour of an Australian owned manufacturing facility. Frank Bainimarama will meet Scott Morrison today \u2013 it is his first visit since becoming Fijian prime minister. The parliament is all set up with the official welcome mat \u2013 there will be cannons \u2013 and we\u2019ll have the happy cool friends photo opportunity a little later this morning. It\u2019s also the pair\u2019s first meeting since Bainimarama criticised Morrison\u2019s attitude at the Pacific Islands forum but both have since said everything is fine. The other big issue apparently keeping the National party up at night is plant- and legume-based foods and liquids being sold with the same terminology as animal products. Because apparently, vegetarians and vegans are very, very confused and don\u2019t realise that almond milk doesn\u2019t come from cows. As Helen Davidson reported at the weekend from the National party conference: The Nationals meeting also voted in favour of a motion to lobby the federal government to change labelling requirements on vegan food, preventing products such as soy milk, almond milk and vegan meat from being branded as such. Under current laws, only milk from cows can be labelled \u201cmilk\u201d without an added qualifier. \u201cI\u2019m not anti plant-based protein foods, I think they\u2019re going to have a role to play in the food proposition going forward,\u201d said agricultural minister and deputy Nationals leader, Bridget McKenzie. \u201cBut that means then we need to be very clear with consumers about what they\u2019re purchasing. \u201cSo if you want actual chicken, then that\u2019s what it should be called. If you want plant-based protein that tastes like chicken, then that\u2019s what it should called.\u201d An August report from IBIS World found the soy and almond milk production industry, which also included rice and coconut milk, was expected to have grown by 8.3% in five years by 2019-20. The growing market demand for non-dairy milk was attributed to consumer health concerns, and while soy milk had been the dominant non-dairy choice, its share of the market was declining against alternatives such as almond milk. We have reached the part of the 46th parliament where Pauline Hanson will take the contrary view to anything Jacqui Lambie suggests. Which is how I dealt with my teenage years, so I know that it is not the most effective strategy of all time, but still. We can\u2019t all be Sun Tsu. Lambie has suggested some sort of conscription like system to have people as emergency service volunteers. Hanson is against it. As she told the Today show, which has picked up where Sunrise left off and given her a platform on national television: Don\u2019t head down this path. We have volunteer rural firefighters in Queensland, plus also we have the same in the CFA in Victoria. Now, you can\u2019t send out volunteers to work as volunteers and fighting bushfires. It is training that they need to go through \u2026 You just can\u2019t go out and send people to do these volunteer jobs. A lot of these kids can\u2019t turn up for a job application. Or turn up to get a job. It all sounds great but look, if it\u2019s going to work, fine, give it a go. But I think it is going to be awfully hard. Lambie has emerged as the powerbroker of this Senate, along with Centre Alliance. It has kind of put One Nation in the shade. That is until Gerard Rennick ends up doing what a lot of his Queensland colleagues think he\u2019ll probably do, and moves to the crossbench. Then \u2013 game on. Michael McCormack has started Monday in the most Michael McCormack of ways \u2013 blaming frogs for getting in the way of dams. AAP reports: \u201cYou\u2019ll always get some environmentalist who will find a frog or something to roadblock a dam or a road,\u201d Michael McCormack told ABC Radio on Monday. State and federal National Party politicians are ramping up calls to fast-track the planning process for dam construction, as parts of regional NSW rapidly run out of water due to the ongoing drought. How. Dare. They. It\u2019s almost like native animals think they LIVE in the environment or something. Anthony Albanese says Labor is looking at the \u201cbig stick\u201d legislation and is yet to make up its mind on whether or not it will support it. He says the party needs to look at the bill to see if the concerns it had last parliament have been addressed. \u201cBut at this stage we have a slogan dressed up as legislation,\u201d he says. Welcome to the fourth last joint sitting week for the year. We start this week as we finished last week, with the government still working on getting Senate crossbench support for its welfare and union bills, and people still talking about Gladys Liu. At the weekend Scott Morrison was forced to \u201cclarify\u201d his use of the name \u201cShanghai Sam\u201d after he first denied using it in relation to Sam Dastyari, but, faced with video evidence from his own Facebook page, then said he had misheard the question. Except this was his response: I didn\u2019t use either of those phrases, so \u2026 I think people here today are focused on the fires, not Canberra. I am not sure how you can say you didn\u2019t hear something when you use \u201cI didn\u2019t use either of those phrases\u201d in the answer, but I guess that\u2019s just more Canberra bubble shiz. So the \u201cnothing to see here, keep it moving\u201d train continues with Liu. Meanwhile, the government has decided now is the time to bring back its \u201cbig stick\u201d energy legislation, which (after warnings, and then if the federal court says so) would allow energy companies to be forcibly broken up. That means we get more Angus Taylor \u2013 the emissions reduction minister has been on ABC and on Sky this morning and continues to present information like the second speaker in a high school debate. Improvisation is not his strong suit. The ACCC is to release its first update since the July 1 Energy Retail Code came into effect, which will report that hundreds of thousands of Australians have received savings of up to $190 under the changes. Before it came into effect, Taylor had promised savings of up to $800. But, just like internet dating, reality rarely lives up to the sell. We\u2019ll have all of that and more this morning, with Mike Bowers helping to bring you all the expressions and body language, with Katharine Murphy, Sarah Martin and Paul Karp to help break down what it all means. I have found a coffee. So let\u2019s get into it.",

      "body": "<p>Bose\u2019s new top-of-the range 700 noise-cancelling headphones attempt to be the new gold standard, with a new design, new technology and a shift in focus.</p> <p>Launched to sit atop the long-standing kings of noise-cancelling cans, the \u00a3300 QuietComfort 35 II, the new \u00a3350 Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 look to shift Bose\u2019s rather staid image toward something more modern and fashionable.</p> <p>Out goes the segmented headband and folding arms, and in comes a slimmer, seamless metal band terminating in two arms that slide smoothly through the outside of the ear cups for height adjustment.</p> <p>It\u2019s a sleeker design that removes harsh lines, junctions and breaks. Even the bunching of the ear pads has been smoothed out. The shape of the ear cups forces the headband, which is lined with a soft-touch silicone pad, to sit further back on your head. Wear them too far forward and they\u2019ll slide off.</p> <p>And they no longer fold in half. Instead the ear cups simply rotate, fitting into a wedge-shaped case, which Bose says is thinner at one end than the QC35 II\u2019s and therefore easier to fit into a flight bag. But not folding means they are harder squeeze into an every-day bag without the case. A small step back in my opinion.</p> <p>On the head they feel slightly heavier than the QC35 II. The ear pads are slimmer and the ear cups feel more airy, which helped keep my ears cooler, but they grip the sides of my head noticeably harder. They were comfortable for extended periods, but they didn\u2019t feel as immediately snug and relaxed as the QC35.</p> <h2>Slick controls</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ca4fbe225ffa75b72caabbfcf33d6356b061e967\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca4fbe225ffa75b72caabbfcf33d6356b061e967/0_127_4668_2802/1000.jpg\" alt=\"bose noise cancelling headphones 700 review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The front half of the right ear cup where the Bose logo is stamped is touch-sensitive.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The controls have been redesigned too. Two buttons on the right take care of power, pairing and voice assistant control \u2013 Google Assistant, Alexa or Siri - with advanced Google Assistant or Alexa functionality baked-in if you\u2019d like.</p> <p>A button on the left ear cup controls the noise-cancelling level. Press and hold to activate conversation mode, which pipes in sound from outside so you can talk to someone \u2013 although you look exceptionally rude doing so.</p> <p>The new touch controls are the best I\u2019ve used on any headphones, and worked reliably even in inclement weather, but not at all with non touch-enabled gloves. Double tap the Bose logo on the right ear cup to pause or play. Swipe forward or back for track skip, and up and down to adjust volume. Seven full swipes takes you from minimum to maximum volume with a continual progression in between.</p> <p>Connectivity was rock solid to phones and tablets, both Android and iOS. The headphones support Bluetooth 5, but only the SBC and AAC audio codecs. That\u2019s fine for Apple users, because AAC is the highest quality an iPhone or iPad can support, but Android or Windows PC users looking for more advanced formats such as Qualcomm\u2019s aptX series or Sony\u2019s LDAC will have to look elsewhere.</p> <p>Audio latency control was good, with audio and video perfectly in sync with all the major video apps and services, including the often problematic YouTube. Games showed a little bit of audio delay.</p> <p>The Headphones 700 can also connect to two devices at once, which means you can watch a video on an iPad and then take a call on your phone or similar. It worked great with mobile devices, but connecting them to a computer and a phone simultaneously caused audio issues.</p> <p>You can pair lots of devices and hot swap between them using the Bose Music app or you can simply disconnect and reconnect your devices manually using their Bluetooth settings.</p> <h2>Top noise cancelling</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"36f371c2255e0e901c0b799c166f30b099bf1822\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/36f371c2255e0e901c0b799c166f30b099bf1822/591_460_3845_2307/1000.jpg\" alt=\"bose noise cancelling headphones 700 review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">You can switch between 11 levels of noise cancelling using the Bose Music app, from maximum blocking to fully open ambient sound.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/21/bose-qc35-wireless-bluetooth-noise-cancelling-headphones-review\">original QC35</a> pushed noise-cancelling technology to the next level and the Headphones 700 match them, competing favourably with Sony\u2019s best, particularly on commutes, handling wind noise better than any other. Turned up to maximum, the noise cancelling is very effective, blocking or diminishing even the most difficult of sudden or loud noises. The difference between the Headphones 700 and even mid-range models is night and day. You get what you pay for.</p> <p>Bose has re-engineered its noise-cancelling system for greater flexibility. Now you can choose from 11 levels from maximum noise blocking to fully open, piping ambient sounds from your environment into the headphones using the microphones on their surface.</p> <p>That means if you want some awareness of what\u2019s happening around you, such as conversations in an office, but without the hum of air conditioning or computers you can adjust the level accordingly. The ambient sound mode is a cut above too, sounding far more natural and open than any other similar technology I\u2019ve used.</p> <p>Press the noise-cancelling button on the left ear cup to switch between three favourite noise-cancelling levels, which default to zero, five and 10. Every time you switch levels or in and out of conversation mode, the noise-cancelling ramps smoothly up and down again like someone turning a big analogue volume knob. It\u2019s a small detail that makes the whole experience feel all the more luxurious.</p> <h2>Great sound</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"261c415c1d62f41233c0b99a417077f3a7bacb4f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/261c415c1d62f41233c0b99a417077f3a7bacb4f/65_0_4792_2877/1000.jpg\" alt=\"bose noise cancelling headphones 700 review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">If you like super-clean, full sound, these headphones hit the spot.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bose products always have a signature sound that has proven divisive in audiophile circles. The Headphones 700 are no different. If you didn\u2019t like how the QC35 or even the original TriPort headphones sounded, you won\u2019t like these.</p> <p>If you do, then you\u2019ll be treated to well-balanced audio with punch in the low end for a fully rounded sound and clarity in the highs to make tracks sparkle. You\u2019ll also hear an almost clinical separation of tones, which allows individual instruments and notes to stand boldly on their own, not blended into a mush.</p> <p>The Headphones 700 can handle most music genres well, with an easy listening and open sound that\u2019s slightly more spacious than the QC35. Overall they are some of the most consistent and best-sounding headphones you can buy, right up their with Sony\u2019s MX-1000M3.</p> <p>There is no equaliser control yet, but Bose said it was working on the ability to adjust the sound of the headphones as part of its new architecture.</p> <h2>Clear calling</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"00e40169c8f4b9c4d24ef59c95ead175dcc370c3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/00e40169c8f4b9c4d24ef59c95ead175dcc370c3/0_94_4928_2958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"bose noise cancelling headphones 700 review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Power, noise cancelling and voice assistant buttons round out the on-headphones controls.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Voice calling, as well as voice assistant access, is a new focus for the Bose headphones. Using a series of microphones they perform a similar beam-forming noise cancellation on your voice as smart speakers. The result is clear and loud voice pickup even in the noisiest of environments. If you make a lot of calls or talk to Alexa, Google Assistant or Siri all the time these are for you.</p> <h2>20 hours battery life</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"438d822c44a8a5a5cf0ee1ff6661f9802fa14286\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/438d822c44a8a5a5cf0ee1ff6661f9802fa14286/267_64_4661_2797/1000.jpg\" alt=\"bose noise cancelling headphones 700 review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Bose charge via USB-C with a 2.5mm analogue port for using a standard 2.5mm to 3.5mm headphones cable.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Headphones 700 last just shy of 20 hours between charges when using Bluetooth and noise cancelling turned up to maximum, but longer when used via cable.

      "bodyText": "Bose\u2019s new top-of-the range 700 noise-cancelling headphones attempt to be the new gold standard, with a new design, new technology and a shift in focus. Launched to sit atop the long-standing kings of noise-cancelling cans, the \u00a3300 QuietComfort 35 II, the new \u00a3350 Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 look to shift Bose\u2019s rather staid image toward something more modern and fashionable. Out goes the segmented headband and folding arms, and in comes a slimmer, seamless metal band terminating in two arms that slide smoothly through the outside of the ear cups for height adjustment. It\u2019s a sleeker design that removes harsh lines, junctions and breaks. Even the bunching of the ear pads has been smoothed out. The shape of the ear cups forces the headband, which is lined with a soft-touch silicone pad, to sit further back on your head. Wear them too far forward and they\u2019ll slide off. And they no longer fold in half. Instead the ear cups simply rotate, fitting into a wedge-shaped case, which Bose says is thinner at one end than the QC35 II\u2019s and therefore easier to fit into a flight bag. But not folding means they are harder squeeze into an every-day bag without the case. A small step back in my opinion. On the head they feel slightly heavier than the QC35 II. The ear pads are slimmer and the ear cups feel more airy, which helped keep my ears cooler, but they grip the sides of my head noticeably harder. They were comfortable for extended periods, but they didn\u2019t feel as immediately snug and relaxed as the QC35. Slick controls The controls have been redesigned too. Two buttons on the right take care of power, pairing and voice assistant control \u2013 Google Assistant, Alexa or Siri - with advanced Google Assistant or Alexa functionality baked-in if you\u2019d like. A button on the left ear cup controls the noise-cancelling level. Press and hold to activate conversation mode, which pipes in sound from outside so you can talk to someone \u2013 although you look exceptionally rude doing so. The new touch controls are the best I\u2019ve used on any headphones, and worked reliably even in inclement weather, but not at all with non touch-enabled gloves. Double tap the Bose logo on the right ear cup to pause or play. Swipe forward or back for track skip, and up and down to adjust volume. Seven full swipes takes you from minimum to maximum volume with a continual progression in between. Connectivity was rock solid to phones and tablets, both Android and iOS. The headphones support Bluetooth 5, but only the SBC and AAC audio codecs. That\u2019s fine for Apple users, because AAC is the highest quality an iPhone or iPad can support, but Android or Windows PC users looking for more advanced formats such as Qualcomm\u2019s aptX series or Sony\u2019s LDAC will have to look elsewhere. Audio latency control was good, with audio and video perfectly in sync with all the major video apps and services, including the often problematic YouTube. Games showed a little bit of audio delay. The Headphones 700 can also connect to two devices at once, which means you can watch a video on an iPad and then take a call on your phone or similar. It worked great with mobile devices, but connecting them to a computer and a phone simultaneously caused audio issues. You can pair lots of devices and hot swap between them using the Bose Music app or you can simply disconnect and reconnect your devices manually using their Bluetooth settings. Top noise cancelling The original QC35 pushed noise-cancelling technology to the next level and the Headphones 700 match them, competing favourably with Sony\u2019s best, particularly on commutes, handling wind noise better than any other. Turned up to maximum, the noise cancelling is very effective, blocking or diminishing even the most difficult of sudden or loud noises. The difference between the Headphones 700 and even mid-range models is night and day. You get what you pay for. Bose has re-engineered its noise-cancelling system for greater flexibility. Now you can choose from 11 levels from maximum noise blocking to fully open, piping ambient sounds from your environment into the headphones using the microphones on their surface. That means if you want some awareness of what\u2019s happening around you, such as conversations in an office, but without the hum of air conditioning or computers you can adjust the level accordingly. The ambient sound mode is a cut above too, sounding far more natural and open than any other similar technology I\u2019ve used. Press the noise-cancelling button on the left ear cup to switch between three favourite noise-cancelling levels, which default to zero, five and 10. Every time you switch levels or in and out of conversation mode, the noise-cancelling ramps smoothly up and down again like someone turning a big analogue volume knob. It\u2019s a small detail that makes the whole experience feel all the more luxurious. Great sound Bose products always have a signature sound that has proven divisive in audiophile circles. The Headphones 700 are no different. If you didn\u2019t like how the QC35 or even the original TriPort headphones sounded, you won\u2019t like these. If you do, then you\u2019ll be treated to well-balanced audio with punch in the low end for a fully rounded sound and clarity in the highs to make tracks sparkle. You\u2019ll also hear an almost clinical separation of tones, which allows individual instruments and notes to stand boldly on their own, not blended into a mush. The Headphones 700 can handle most music genres well, with an easy listening and open sound that\u2019s slightly more spacious than the QC35. Overall they are some of the most consistent and best-sounding headphones you can buy, right up their with Sony\u2019s MX-1000M3. There is no equaliser control yet, but Bose said it was working on the ability to adjust the sound of the headphones as part of its new architecture. Clear calling Voice calling, as well as voice assistant access, is a new focus for the Bose headphones. Using a series of microphones they perform a similar beam-forming noise cancellation on your voice as smart speakers. The result is clear and loud voice pickup even in the noisiest of environments. If you make a lot of calls or talk to Alexa, Google Assistant or Siri all the time these are for you. 20 hours battery life The Headphones 700 last just shy of 20 hours between charges when using Bluetooth and noise cancelling turned up to maximum, but longer when used via cable. While not industry leading, given Sony\u2019s MX-1000M3 last in the region of 30 hours. That\u2019s long enough to last a week\u2019s commuting or a transatlantic flight. It takes just under 2.5 hours to charge them via USB-C, which is fairly slow compared to the fast-charging smartphone. A 15-minute quick charge provides over three hours of playback time though, which is handy if you forget to charge them. Observations There\u2019s a strum on a double bass when you turn them on, which I found annoyingly loud in quiet environments Occasionally it took several attempts to get the Bose Music app to connect to the headphones You can independently adjust the volume on the headphones when using the wired connection, handy for use as a gaming headset or with a headphones splitter sharing a tablet The case has a small pouch inside that holds the USB-C and analogue headphones cable Bose no longer supplies an aeroplane headphones adapter in the box, but you probably don\u2019t need one anymore The headphones support Bose AR, the company\u2019s audio-augmented reality platform Price The Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 cost \u00a3349.95 and are available in black or silver. For comparison, the RRP for the Bose QuietComfort 35 II is \u00a3300 (currently \u00a3260), Sony\u2019s WH-1000XM3 cost \u00a3329, Beats Studio 3 Wireless cost \u00a3300, with cheaper models such as Lindy\u2019s BNX-60 starting around \u00a390.

      "body": "<p>For someone who makes \u201cjob-killing robots\u201d Tony Nighswander has an ironic problem. The US jobs market has not been this hot for 50 years and the president of APT Manufacturing Solutions, an Ohio-based company that specializes in robotic equipment, can\u2019t find enough workers.</p> <p>With American unemployment at lows last seen around the time of the first lunar landing, his clients are turning to APT and its robots to fill the positions they can\u2019t find people for. But he doesn\u2019t dare take on more salespeople because he\u2019s not sure he can hire enough workers to get the robots running.</p> <p>\u201cRobots killing jobs, that\u2019s a myth. Nine out of 10 times when we put in robots, they increase production but they don\u2019t take away people,\u201d says Nighswander. And right now \u201cthere\u2019s a war for people\u201d, he says as he shows off APT\u2019s shiny, air-conditioned facility in Hicksville, a rural village set in flat farmland on the edge of Indiana.</p> <p>Many US businesses are now facing Nighswander\u2019s dilemma. Attracting quality applicants consistently ranks as the top issue facing businesses. And beneath today\u2019s jobs boom lies a bigger problem: a skills shortage that is leaving many behind and can only get worse if, or rather when, the current jobs boom fades.</p> <p>Some <a href=\"https://www.shrm.org/hr-today/trends-and-forecasting/research-and-surveys/Documents/SHRM%20Skills%20Gap%202019.pdf\">83% are currently struggling</a> to find workers with the right skills, according to the Society for Human Resource Management. An ageing population means the pool of skilled labor is shrinking.

Built and programmed at APT they can put together a chair in 16 seconds, package 15,000 pounds of mashed potato in an hour, fill 720 cups of fast-food dipping sauce in a minute.</p> <p>Once those machines are in, all those menial, repetitive jobs are gone.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c34bf6035a73a4df967169ac7c14dc4fd53e7c13\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c34bf6035a73a4df967169ac7c14dc4fd53e7c13/0_386_5859_3514/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u201cRobots increase production, but they don\u2019t take away people,\u201d said Tony Nighswander, president of APT Manufacturing Solutions.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Robots increase production, but they don\u2019t take away people,\u2019 said Tony Nighswander, president of APT Manufacturing Solutions.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dominic Rushe</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet while APT can\u2019t make enough robots to do those jobs, the unemployment rate in Ohio is 4.2%, slightly above the national average of 3.7% but a fraction of the 12% it reached in January 2010 as the last recession unwound. Across the border in Indiana just 3.3% of the population is unemployed. The US has now added jobs every month for a record 107 months in a row. There were 7.35m job openings in the US in June, 1.3 jobs for every unemployed person.</p> <p>But below the surface there are still problems.</p> <p>While they serve as a useful proxy for the health of the economy, the monthly national unemployment numbers can never really give a true picture of a country of 327 million people spread across 3.8m vastly different square miles.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The US has now added jobs every month for a record 107 months in a row. There were 7.35m job openings in the US in June, 1.3 jobs for every unemployed person</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Even in Ohio there are big disparities between counties. Unemployment in Monroe county, across the Ohio river from long-suffering West Virginia, was 7.3% in June, an hour south of Hicksville in Mercer county the rate was just 2.7%.</p> <p>Nationally, the figures also still show a substantial divide by race. Some 6% of African Americans were unemployed in July and 4.5% of Hispanics didn\u2019t have a job. Those figures have come down substantially since the recession, but the gap remains. For teenagers, the unemployment rate is a depressing 12.8%.</p> <p>The number of people sitting out the jobs market also remains high. In July, the <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2016/article/labor-force-participation-what-has-happened-since-the-peak.htm\">participation rate</a> \u2013 the percentage of people in work or actively looking for a job \u2013 was 63%. It peaked at 67.3% in early 2000 after rising for decades. Now it seems stuck and has changed little for three years despite falling unemployment suggesting that even in this market a large pool of people have just given up.</p> <p>Wages, too, have grown slowly despite the continuing strength of hiring.</p> <p>Despite these issues, there is still no arguing that the US job market has enjoyed a record run.</p> <p>It\u2019s an employees\u2019 job market \u2013 for those with the right skills \u2013 and Nighswander in Hicksville (population 3,500) is competing with better-paying companies in more glamorous cities.</p> <p>John Clingan, an APT controls manager, gets two or three calls from headhunters each week. Trying to hire people is \u201cruthless\u201d, he says. \u201cKids are getting $80,000 out of college. Five or six years ago that would have been $50-60,000.\u201d The automotive industry will pay them six figures, he says. \u201cEven if they don\u2019t know what they are doing. Basically you can get a job now if you can spell robot.\u201d</p> <p>So bad has the situation got that Nighswander visits local schools to offer apprenticeships and APT will pay the college fees of employees who will sign on to work for the company. Four years of college means six years at APT, or you have to pay the company back.</p> <p>Investing so much in his staff is a risk and Nighswander has little illusion that he can keep all those he puts through college. \u201cIf I can get them involved in a church or get them married, I am doing good. If they are still single, then they are probably going to move to Denver,\u201d he laughs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"17b81c2d8f212db4a3a2da86c596105213436dd0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/17b81c2d8f212db4a3a2da86c596105213436dd0/0_0_3240_1945/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Low unemployment and slow wage growth has encouraged people to look for new jobs at a time when companies are finding it difficult to take on skilled workers, said services provider Moorepay.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Low unemployment and slow wage growth has encouraged people to look for new jobs at a time when companies are finding it hard to take on skilled workers, said services provider Moorepay.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lauren Hurley/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But today\u2019s white-hot jobs market hides some structural issues that will reveal themselves when the tide of hiring recedes, warns Maurice Jones, chief executive of Local Initiatives Support Corporation (LISC).</p> <p>LISC works with local government agencies, foundations and the private sector to get those in struggling areas back to work.

      "bodyText": "For someone who makes \u201cjob-killing robots\u201d Tony Nighswander has an ironic problem. The US jobs market has not been this hot for 50 years and the president of APT Manufacturing Solutions, an Ohio-based company that specializes in robotic equipment, can\u2019t find enough workers. With American unemployment at lows last seen around the time of the first lunar landing, his clients are turning to APT and its robots to fill the positions they can\u2019t find people for. But he doesn\u2019t dare take on more salespeople because he\u2019s not sure he can hire enough workers to get the robots running. \u201cRobots killing jobs, that\u2019s a myth. Nine out of 10 times when we put in robots, they increase production but they don\u2019t take away people,\u201d says Nighswander. And right now \u201cthere\u2019s a war for people\u201d, he says as he shows off APT\u2019s shiny, air-conditioned facility in Hicksville, a rural village set in flat farmland on the edge of Indiana. Many US businesses are now facing Nighswander\u2019s dilemma. Attracting quality applicants consistently ranks as the top issue facing businesses. And beneath today\u2019s jobs boom lies a bigger problem: a skills shortage that is leaving many behind and can only get worse if, or rather when, the current jobs boom fades. Some 83% are currently struggling to find workers with the right skills, according to the Society for Human Resource Management. An ageing population means the pool of skilled labor is shrinking. By 2029 employers in nearly every state will face significant shortages of qualified workers, according to a report by American Action Forum (AAF). APT\u2019s hangar-like space looks a little like an empty Ikea. There\u2019s a lot of bright blue railing and sunflower yellow. APT specializes in Fanuc robots, developed by the Japanese automation giant. Yellow robot arms and conveyor belt machines buzz quietly through their motions on the facility\u2019s floor. Built and programmed at APT they can put together a chair in 16 seconds, package 15,000 pounds of mashed potato in an hour, fill 720 cups of fast-food dipping sauce in a minute. Once those machines are in, all those menial, repetitive jobs are gone. Yet while APT can\u2019t make enough robots to do those jobs, the unemployment rate in Ohio is 4.2%, slightly above the national average of 3.7% but a fraction of the 12% it reached in January 2010 as the last recession unwound. Across the border in Indiana just 3.3% of the population is unemployed. The US has now added jobs every month for a record 107 months in a row. There were 7.35m job openings in the US in June, 1.3 jobs for every unemployed person. But below the surface there are still problems. While they serve as a useful proxy for the health of the economy, the monthly national unemployment numbers can never really give a true picture of a country of 327 million people spread across 3.8m vastly different square miles. Even in Ohio there are big disparities between counties. Unemployment in Monroe county, across the Ohio river from long-suffering West Virginia, was 7.3% in June, an hour south of Hicksville in Mercer county the rate was just 2.7%. Nationally, the figures also still show a substantial divide by race. Some 6% of African Americans were unemployed in July and 4.5% of Hispanics didn\u2019t have a job. Those figures have come down substantially since the recession, but the gap remains. For teenagers, the unemployment rate is a depressing 12.8%. The number of people sitting out the jobs market also remains high. In July, the participation rate \u2013 the percentage of people in work or actively looking for a job \u2013 was 63%. It peaked at 67.3% in early 2000 after rising for decades. Now it seems stuck and has changed little for three years despite falling unemployment suggesting that even in this market a large pool of people have just given up. Wages, too, have grown slowly despite the continuing strength of hiring. Despite these issues, there is still no arguing that the US job market has enjoyed a record run. It\u2019s an employees\u2019 job market \u2013 for those with the right skills \u2013 and Nighswander in Hicksville (population 3,500) is competing with better-paying companies in more glamorous cities. John Clingan, an APT controls manager, gets two or three calls from headhunters each week. Trying to hire people is \u201cruthless\u201d, he says. \u201cKids are getting $80,000 out of college. Five or six years ago that would have been $50-60,000.\u201d The automotive industry will pay them six figures, he says. \u201cEven if they don\u2019t know what they are doing. Basically you can get a job now if you can spell robot.\u201d So bad has the situation got that Nighswander visits local schools to offer apprenticeships and APT will pay the college fees of employees who will sign on to work for the company. Four years of college means six years at APT, or you have to pay the company back. Investing so much in his staff is a risk and Nighswander has little illusion that he can keep all those he puts through college. \u201cIf I can get them involved in a church or get them married, I am doing good. If they are still single, then they are probably going to move to Denver,\u201d he laughs. But today\u2019s white-hot jobs market hides some structural issues that will reveal themselves when the tide of hiring recedes, warns Maurice Jones, chief executive of Local Initiatives Support Corporation (LISC). LISC works with local government agencies, foundations and the private sector to get those in struggling areas back to work. While he agrees the job market is still booming across the country Jones sees pockets of deep unemployment in communities that can only dream of a job in robotics. \u201cIt\u2019s an incredibly robust jobs market, but it\u2019s an incredibly robust jobs market for the folks that can bring those skills that the jobs market now rewards,\u201d says Jones. \u201cThat 3.7% [unemployment rate] is an aggregate that is simply not a true picture of what is happening on the ground for a huge chunk of America,\u201d he says. \u201cEveryday people continue to be challenged by a job market that is growing but one where they need an investment to take any advantage of.\u201d Without an investment in training people and in transportation and childcare many will be left behind, he warns. \u201cIn our market we get people coming in with high school diplomas whose literacy and numeracy skills are somewhere between the sixth and eight grade [ages 11 to 14].

Nighswander says something needs to be done. In large part, he blames the education system for the skills gap. \u201cIf you ask high school kids to tell you about industry then they will tell you about what they remember from their history books. They are still teaching the industrial revolution, it\u2019s dark, dangerous, dirty,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are teaching industrial revolution 1.0, this is 4.0,\u201d he says sweeping his arm around the clean, quiet, air-conditioned work floor. \u201cThis is not that.\u201d Shop class, where practical skills such as carpentry or engineering are taught, has disappeared from most US schools. On the floor at APT, Eric Walker, manager of the company\u2019s manual machining department, says even the basic skills are missing. \u201cThey don\u2019t know \u2018righty tighty, lefty loosey\u2019 for a screw,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame.

      "body": "<p>After what\u2019s been a mostly God-awful year at the movies, the fall festival season has felt more necessary than ever, a warm hug after eight months of being repeatedly slapped in the face.</p> <p>Shot-in-the-dark speculation over next year\u2019s awards race has been replaced with far more informed predictions, a guessing game still, but one that\u2019s already easier to play. By this time last year, we\u2019d already seen six of the eight best picture nominees and so with Venice, Telluride and Toronto out of the way once again, we can sift through the hits and misses to figure out what films and performances will have enough power to motor their way through to February.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/sep/11/do-film-festivals-help-or-hurt-their-host-cities-venice-sundance\">Do film festivals help or hurt their host cities?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Let\u2019s start with Venice, a festival that\u2019s become a reliable launching pad for the surer bets \u2013 in previous years Birdman, Gravity, The Shape of Water, Roma and La La Land all debuted \u2013 although this year\u2019s crop offered up a more mixed bag than usual. The biggest story came from an unlikely place: a DC movie from The Hangover director Todd Phillips. Grimy origins tale <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/aug/31/joker-review-twisted-tour-de-force-joaquin-phoenix\">Joker</a> would have arrived with a question mark no matter where it landed but playing in competition at arguably the most prestigious film festival in the world, it was an even wilder curio, the highest profile slot a comic book movie has ever snagged. Reviews were mostly rapturous, especially for star Joaquin Phoenix in the lead, and it went on to win the festival\u2019s biggest prize, the Golden Lion, one of only six American films to do so in the last 30 years. It continued to impress in Toronto although some pushback began and negative reviews started to flood in, criticising its superficial emptiness and potentially worrying effect on what\u2019s set to be <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2019/09/joker-box-office-opening-weekend-projections-1202732548/\">a massive audience</a>. At this stage, I\u2019d bet heavily on a nomination and even a win for Phoenix but the film might struggle to sustain itself with voters who might be repelled by its subject matter and (*whispers*) one-note vacuity.</p> <p>After winning last year\u2019s Golden Lion with Roma, Netflix returned with their second Noah Baumbach project, the bittersweet divorce drama <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/aug/29/marriage-story-review-adam-driver-scarlett-johansson-divorce-comedy-drama-noah-baumbach\">Marriage Story</a>. It was met with universal acclaim (after both Venice and Toronto, it\u2019s one of the rare films to sustain a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes) and while Baumbach\u2019s films haven\u2019t typically scored with the Academy (his one nomination was in 2006 for the screenplay of The Squid and the Whale), most agreed that this was his finest and most expansive film to date. Nominations for stars Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson, both on career-best form, seem like sure things while Laura Dern\u2019s eye-catching turn as a tenacious lawyer should also snag her a supporting actress nod, thanks largely to a powerful speech she gives on how society judges mothers. There\u2019s a lot going for it (it\u2019s also set in the entertainment industry which voters love) but it feels like the kind of film which might not seem splashy or <em>important</em> enough for the Academy to give its top prize to although I can see it scoring with a lot of critics circles.</p> <p>There were also polite reviews for James Gray\u2019s long-gestating space epic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/aug/29/ad-astra-review-brad-pitt-reaches-the-stars-in-superb-space-opera-with-serious-daddy-issues\">Ad Astra</a> and Steven Soderbergh\u2019s financial satire <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/01/the-laundromat-review-gary-oldman-spins-lies-to-meryl-streep-in-sparkling-comedy\">The Laundromat</a> but both were commonly seen as awards race non-starters while the less said about Kristin Stewart\u2019s muddled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/aug/30/seberg-review-kristen-stewart-biopic-benedict-andrews-jean-fbi\">Seberg</a>, the better.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c7e349dfea4ecb94f32b15d6a6b7e6e5012ec027\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c7e349dfea4ecb94f32b15d6a6b7e6e5012ec027/0_400_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Matt Damon and Christian Bale in Ford v Ferrari.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Matt Damon and Christian Bale in Ford v Ferrari.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Merrick Morton/Fox</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Away to the mountains soon after for Telluride, a more boutiquey festival that over a long weekend tends to premiere a more starry, and more mainstream, bunch of contenders \u2013 previous festivals have welcomed Wild, The Imitation Game, Moonlight, Can You Ever Forgive Me?, 12 Years a Slave and Ladybird.</p> <p>This year, one of the safest conclusions is that Renee Zellweger will be making a flashy awards season comeback with her role as Judy Garland in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/aug/31/judy-review-renee-zellweger-garland-biopic\">Judy</a>. The film received mixed notices, with many critiquing its by-the-numbers storytelling, but almost everyone was in agreement over Zellweger\u2019s effective performance and the Academy loves an off-screen narrative, the former winner returning to the fold after years in the wilderness. There was another safe bet in the shape of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/10/ford-v-ferrari-review-james-mangold-matt-damon-christian-bale\">Ford v Ferrari</a>, starring Matt Damon and Christian Bale, which seems to be taking the slot of this year\u2019s boringly solid \u201cI guess so\u201d contender, the kind of film no one really gets excited about but no one truly hates. The audience at the Toronto premiere responded with a great deal of enthusiasm, more so than some of the later reviews. Acting recognition depends on how Fox decides to campaign the two leads, one of whom will likely to be demoted to supporting, but you can expect it to take the eighth best picture slot before promptly being forgotten about by March.</p> <p>Critics admired the effects in sturdy Felicity Jones/Eddie Redmayne ballooning adventure <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/10/the-aeronauts-review-charming-balloon-adventure-way-up-where-the-air-is-clear\">The Aeronauts</a>, while recognising its cliches, suggesting its awards chances might be slim while most found Edward Norton\u2019s labour of love/vanity project <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/12/motherless-brooklyn-film-review-edward-norton\">Motherless Brooklyn</a> to be a misfire. There was early buzz and early enthusiasm for Krisha director Trey Edward Shults\u2019 bold and stylistic A24 drama <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/06/waves-review-trey-edward-shults-film\">Waves</a>, with some comparing it to Moonlight, but by the time it showed at Toronto, reviews started to sour. It could still be an Independent Spirit Awards contender but anything bigger is unlikely. Most seemed to like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/12/the-two-popes-anthony-hopkins-and-jonathan-pryce-divine-in-papal-faceoff\">The Two Popes</a>, a film that also went on to be a big hit with audiences in Toronto, and Netflix\u2019s papal drama, starring lead/supporting actor contenders Jonathan Pryce and Anthony Hopkins, could be a reliable awards mainstay this season while finally, Adam Sandler could see himself in the running for a best actor trophy for his barnstorming turn in the Safdie brothers\u2019 exhausting drama <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/10/uncut-gems-review-adam-sandler-safdie-brothers\">Uncut Gems</a>, but the film\u2019s abrasiveness could turn some voters off.</p> <p>Just a week later and all eyes were focused on Toronto, a festival that boasts the most stars if not the most slam-dunks in terms of awards season \u2013 previous premieres include If Beale Street Could Talk, Still Alice, I, Tonya, Lion and The Martian. Last year saw Green Book start its shock crawl to winning best picture, giving the festival a much-needed bump, and this year saw a few similarly effective crowd-pleasers spark awards talk. The surprise name on everybody\u2019s lips during the week was Jennifer Lopez, whose performance as a stripper stealing from her clientele in the raucously entertaining fact-based drama <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/07/hustlers-review-j-lo-strippers-candace-wu\">Hustlers</a> was praised by almost every critic. It\u2019s a sensational turn in a film that was also largely praised and had many, including myself, predicting a best supporting actress nomination. The Academy already loves her (she\u2019s one of their most used picks to announce an award) and the film is shaping up to be one of the fall\u2019s biggest sleeper hits, everything aligning for a dream campaign.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"83784e3692f9f0be8aaae505c7f2a5d4fbd88d8f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/83784e3692f9f0be8aaae505c7f2a5d4fbd88d8f/0_0_1200_600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Hanks in A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Hanks in A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lacey Terrell/TIFF</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another sure bet from Toronto came from two-time Oscar winner Tom Hanks and his deep-rooted transformation as much-loved kids TV star Mister Rogers in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/09/a-beautiful-day-in-the-neighborhood-review-tom-hanks-charms-as-mister-rogers\">A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood</a>. Avoiding the structure of a traditional biopic, the pic instead positions Rogers as a kindly figure in the life of a journalist interviewing him meaning that Hanks will likely be running as supporting actor which would, astonishingly, be his first nomination in 19 years as he was snubbed for Captain Phillips, Bridge of Spies and The Post. Expect the film to also get best picture recognition with screenings accompanied by pretty much non-stop sniffles. There was a similarly emotive reaction to fact-based legal drama <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/07/just-mercy-review-star-power-lifts-sturdy-emotive-legal-drama\">Just Mercy</a> which starred Michael B Jordan as lawyer Bryan Stevenson. The film was seen as boringly made by some but almost all appreciated its powerful narrative and while Jordan\u2019s role might be a bit too muted for Academy attention, it\u2019s likely that Oscar winner Jamie Foxx, playing a falsely imprisoned inmate, will grab a best supporting actor nomination. The film itself is also the kind of solid, tear-jerking, crowd-pleaser that could see it genuinely affecting voters, this year\u2019s Green Book if you will, just without the whitewashing.</p> <p>One of the festival\u2019s most enthusiastically received films was Rian Johnson\u2019s devilishly entertaining whodunnit <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/08/knives-out-review-rian-johnson-crafts-a-devious-meta-whodunnit\">Knives Out</a>, a star-studded Agatha Christie homage that had the most ebullient audience reaction I\u2019ve seen for months. It\u2019s probably not an awards contender although if voters react as well as Toronto critics did, then a screenplay nomination could happen. Another audience favourite was Takia Waititi\u2019s second world war comedy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/09/jojo-rabbit-review-scarlett-johansson-lifts-smug-hitler-comedy\">Jojo Rabbit</a>, which sees him playing Hitler as cast as a buffoonish imaginary friend. Critical response was mixed but its simple, twee storytelling could work with the Academy who might respond to Scarlett Johansson\u2019s charming supporting performance.

      "bodyText": "After what\u2019s been a mostly God-awful year at the movies, the fall festival season has felt more necessary than ever, a warm hug after eight months of being repeatedly slapped in the face. Shot-in-the-dark speculation over next year\u2019s awards race has been replaced with far more informed predictions, a guessing game still, but one that\u2019s already easier to play. By this time last year, we\u2019d already seen six of the eight best picture nominees and so with Venice, Telluride and Toronto out of the way once again, we can sift through the hits and misses to figure out what films and performances will have enough power to motor their way through to February. Let\u2019s start with Venice, a festival that\u2019s become a reliable launching pad for the surer bets \u2013 in previous years Birdman, Gravity, The Shape of Water, Roma and La La Land all debuted \u2013 although this year\u2019s crop offered up a more mixed bag than usual. The biggest story came from an unlikely place: a DC movie from The Hangover director Todd Phillips. Grimy origins tale Joker would have arrived with a question mark no matter where it landed but playing in competition at arguably the most prestigious film festival in the world, it was an even wilder curio, the highest profile slot a comic book movie has ever snagged. Reviews were mostly rapturous, especially for star Joaquin Phoenix in the lead, and it went on to win the festival\u2019s biggest prize, the Golden Lion, one of only six American films to do so in the last 30 years. It continued to impress in Toronto although some pushback began and negative reviews started to flood in, criticising its superficial emptiness and potentially worrying effect on what\u2019s set to be a massive audience. At this stage, I\u2019d bet heavily on a nomination and even a win for Phoenix but the film might struggle to sustain itself with voters who might be repelled by its subject matter and (*whispers*) one-note vacuity. After winning last year\u2019s Golden Lion with Roma, Netflix returned with their second Noah Baumbach project, the bittersweet divorce drama Marriage Story. It was met with universal acclaim (after both Venice and Toronto, it\u2019s one of the rare films to sustain a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes) and while Baumbach\u2019s films haven\u2019t typically scored with the Academy (his one nomination was in 2006 for the screenplay of The Squid and the Whale), most agreed that this was his finest and most expansive film to date. Nominations for stars Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson, both on career-best form, seem like sure things while Laura Dern\u2019s eye-catching turn as a tenacious lawyer should also snag her a supporting actress nod, thanks largely to a powerful speech she gives on how society judges mothers. There\u2019s a lot going for it (it\u2019s also set in the entertainment industry which voters love) but it feels like the kind of film which might not seem splashy or important enough for the Academy to give its top prize to although I can see it scoring with a lot of critics circles. There were also polite reviews for James Gray\u2019s long-gestating space epic Ad Astra and Steven Soderbergh\u2019s financial satire The Laundromat but both were commonly seen as awards race non-starters while the less said about Kristin Stewart\u2019s muddled Seberg, the better. Away to the mountains soon after for Telluride, a more boutiquey festival that over a long weekend tends to premiere a more starry, and more mainstream, bunch of contenders \u2013 previous festivals have welcomed Wild, The Imitation Game, Moonlight, Can You Ever Forgive Me?, 12 Years a Slave and Ladybird. This year, one of the safest conclusions is that Renee Zellweger will be making a flashy awards season comeback with her role as Judy Garland in Judy. The film received mixed notices, with many critiquing its by-the-numbers storytelling, but almost everyone was in agreement over Zellweger\u2019s effective performance and the Academy loves an off-screen narrative, the former winner returning to the fold after years in the wilderness. There was another safe bet in the shape of Ford v Ferrari, starring Matt Damon and Christian Bale, which seems to be taking the slot of this year\u2019s boringly solid \u201cI guess so\u201d contender, the kind of film no one really gets excited about but no one truly hates. The audience at the Toronto premiere responded with a great deal of enthusiasm, more so than some of the later reviews. Acting recognition depends on how Fox decides to campaign the two leads, one of whom will likely to be demoted to supporting, but you can expect it to take the eighth best picture slot before promptly being forgotten about by March. Critics admired the effects in sturdy Felicity Jones/Eddie Redmayne ballooning adventure The Aeronauts, while recognising its cliches, suggesting its awards chances might be slim while most found Edward Norton\u2019s labour of love/vanity project Motherless Brooklyn to be a misfire. There was early buzz and early enthusiasm for Krisha director Trey Edward Shults\u2019 bold and stylistic A24 drama Waves, with some comparing it to Moonlight, but by the time it showed at Toronto, reviews started to sour. It could still be an Independent Spirit Awards contender but anything bigger is unlikely. Most seemed to like The Two Popes, a film that also went on to be a big hit with audiences in Toronto, and Netflix\u2019s papal drama, starring lead/supporting actor contenders Jonathan Pryce and Anthony Hopkins, could be a reliable awards mainstay this season while finally, Adam Sandler could see himself in the running for a best actor trophy for his barnstorming turn in the Safdie brothers\u2019 exhausting drama Uncut Gems, but the film\u2019s abrasiveness could turn some voters off. Just a week later and all eyes were focused on Toronto, a festival that boasts the most stars if not the most slam-dunks in terms of awards season \u2013 previous premieres include If Beale Street Could Talk, Still Alice, I, Tonya, Lion and The Martian. Last year saw Green Book start its shock crawl to winning best picture, giving the festival a much-needed bump, and this year saw a few similarly effective crowd-pleasers spark awards talk. The surprise name on everybody\u2019s lips during the week was Jennifer Lopez, whose performance as a stripper stealing from her clientele in the raucously entertaining fact-based drama Hustlers was praised by almost every critic. It\u2019s a sensational turn in a film that was also largely praised and had many, including myself, predicting a best supporting actress nomination. The Academy already loves her (she\u2019s one of their most used picks to announce an award) and the film is shaping up to be one of the fall\u2019s biggest sleeper hits, everything aligning for a dream campaign. Another sure bet from Toronto came from two-time Oscar winner Tom Hanks and his deep-rooted transformation as much-loved kids TV star Mister Rogers in A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood. Avoiding the structure of a traditional biopic, the pic instead positions Rogers as a kindly figure in the life of a journalist interviewing him meaning that Hanks will likely be running as supporting actor which would, astonishingly, be his first nomination in 19 years as he was snubbed for Captain Phillips, Bridge of Spies and The Post. Expect the film to also get best picture recognition with screenings accompanied by pretty much non-stop sniffles. There was a similarly emotive reaction to fact-based legal drama Just Mercy which starred Michael B Jordan as lawyer Bryan Stevenson. The film was seen as boringly made by some but almost all appreciated its powerful narrative and while Jordan\u2019s role might be a bit too muted for Academy attention, it\u2019s likely that Oscar winner Jamie Foxx, playing a falsely imprisoned inmate, will grab a best supporting actor nomination. The film itself is also the kind of solid, tear-jerking, crowd-pleaser that could see it genuinely affecting voters, this year\u2019s Green Book if you will, just without the whitewashing. One of the festival\u2019s most enthusiastically received films was Rian Johnson\u2019s devilishly entertaining whodunnit Knives Out, a star-studded Agatha Christie homage that had the most ebullient audience reaction I\u2019ve seen for months. It\u2019s probably not an awards contender although if voters react as well as Toronto critics did, then a screenplay nomination could happen. Another audience favourite was Takia Waititi\u2019s second world war comedy Jojo Rabbit, which sees him playing Hitler as cast as a buffoonish imaginary friend. Critical response was mixed but its simple, twee storytelling could work with the Academy who might respond to Scarlett Johansson\u2019s charming supporting performance. The film also received a major boost yesterday winning the festival\u2019s people\u2019s choice award, seen as a predictor of Oscar success. Voters might also warm to Eddie Murphy\u2019s turn in biopic Dolemite is My Name and especially to his redemptive arc off-screen which could secure him a best actor nomination. Elsewhere the festival saw a lot of half-misses. Impassioned but formulaic Harriet Tubman biopic Harriet received muddled praise for star Cynthia Erivo but not the film itself, Noah Hawley\u2019s wild astronaut drama Lucy in the Sky was seen as a stylish diversion but we won\u2019t see Natalie Portman returning to the best actress category after some scornful reactions while the much-anticipated adaptation of The Goldfinch crash-landed with some of the festival\u2019s harshest reviews. Both Telluride and Toronto also provided a major boost to Cannes favourite Parasite, Bong Joon-Ho\u2019s savage satire that many claim could be South Korea\u2019s first ever best foreign language film nominee and even find its way into the best picture race. Cannes also saw Quentin Tarantino\u2019s Once Upon A Time in Hollywood launch its steady journey to the Oscars with the film likely to pick up a number of major nominations, maybe including a supporting actor win for Brad Pitt, while Pedro Almod\u00f3var\u2019s autobiographical drama Pain and Glory might push Antonio Banderas into the lead acting race. Sundance also saw deserved buzz for Grand Jury prize winner Clemency and star Alfre Woodard although it might be too small to register for voters while Awkwafina\u2019s charming performance in The Farewell will be a critics circle favourite and possibly, with a strong campaign, creep into bigger awards consideration. Annette Bening\u2019s non-gimmicky turn as Dianne Feinstein in The Report could also slide into the best supporting actress category although the film could be too dense and talky for some. The year is far from over though and there are a number of big bets we\u2019ve yet to see. One of the biggest is unveiled in less than two weeks, Martin Scorsese\u2019s Netflix saga The Irishman starring Robert De Niro and Al Pacino.

      "bodyText": "On a warm summer afternoon in the Italian city of Bologna, a group of around 15 young people march through the crowded city centre to a high-end pastry shop in Strada Maggiore. Once there, they don white plastic masks, and a few start plastering the full-length windows and doors with stickers that say \u201cQuesto posto ha un padrone di merda\u201d \u2013 \u201cThis place has a crappy boss\u201d \u2013 while an activist with a megaphone reads testimony from an employee who says he hasn\u2019t been paid for months. As curious passersby stop and watch, the owner confronts the protesters, trying to grab the megaphone and dislodge the masks of some of the protesters. When he calls the police, the group quickly disperses. The Strada Maggiore protest was one of many held since the Padrone di Merda group was set up in January in Bologna, a wealthy city known for its food and its university. The group targeted 16 businesses over the following months, mostly restaurants and bars. Renowned for lasagne, tortellini and tagliatelle al rag\u00f9 (an inauthentic variant of which is known in the English-speaking world as \u201cspaghetti bolognese\u201d, to the annoyance of many Italians, including Bologna\u2019s mayor), the city has a lively and growing dining scene with more than 400 restaurants, pubs and cafes in the central zone \u2013 one for every 37 residents. This combination of education and food has earned Bologna the nickname of \u201cla dotta, la grassa\u201d (the learned, the fat), and means a ready supply of students as cheap and easily exploitable labour. A 2017 government report estimated that the illegal \u201cgrey economy\u201d accounted for 72.6% of jobs in the city\u2019s food and hotel sectors \u2013 a record even in Italy, where undeclared employment is common. University students are especially vulnerable to illegal, benefits-free employment because they need to pay for their studies and see it as transitional, says Francesco Devincenti of the Filcams trade union. The situation has worsened over the past decade because hard-up parents are giving less and less money to their students, says one of the Padrone di Merda activists, who uses the pseudonym Davide. The Padrone di Merda movement started after a group of young Bologna residents started to share stories of their work experiences \u201cand saw they were very similar\u201d, says one of the founders, a university student who uses the pseudonym Barbara. The group\u2019s first action targeted a bar accused of sexual harassment of employees. \u201c[Then] we opened the Facebook page and received many more reports,\u201d Barbara continues. \u201cFor example, there was a pizzeria that changed employees every three months and where the owner insisted on being called \u2018la signora\u2019 (the lady).\u201d As well as receiving complaints through the Facebook page, activists spot allegations of bad employers in local newspaper reports or on social media. Before organising any protest, Barbara says they first make inquiries to verify the complaints, partly because they fear owners might use fake accounts to try to unmask their identities. The group uses its stickers to alert the public that a place is accused of exploiting workers both to discourage customers and because they believe the warning might convince employers to act more fairly in the future. \u201cWe put them up in the hope of not having to come back,\u201d says Barbara. \u201cWhen you are a victim, everyone is supportive but nothing changes. But if you open a Pandora\u2019s box and the owners are afraid of image damage, then things can change.\u201d Although the activists wear masks at demonstrations and hide their real identities online \u2013 fearing that association with the group would threaten their own jobs \u2013 the waiter whose complaint sparked the Strada Maggiore cafe protest, Andrea Paci, went public with his real name.

      "body": "<p>Ian Penman\u2019s first volume of collected essays, published in 1998, was called <em>Vital Signs: Music, Movies and Other Manias</em>. Now, 20 years later, comes<em> It Gets Me Home, This Curving Track</em>. The titles tell a tale: the one denoting urgency and obsession; the other evoking a more contemplative mood, which is fitting for a book that ranges from the \u201cunearthly sonic signatures\u201d that bebop saxophonist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/charlie-parker\" title=\"\">Charlie Parker</a> created in the 1940s to the \u201cplayfully dense personal mythology\u201d that so defined Prince\u2019s postmodern R&amp;B in the 1980s.</p> <p>The line \u201cit gets me home, this curving track\u201d is actually taken from a WH Auden poem, Walks, which, as Penman notes in his introduction, \u201cis a lovely description of spinning vinyl, and also words that might have sprung from any number of unkempt and long-favoured songs\u201d. Songs, in the traditional sense, have long fascinated Penman. He deconstructed them as a fleeting member of post-punk group <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/feb/22/green-gartside-scritti-politti-interview\" title=\"\">Scritti Politti</a> in the late 70s and came to revalue them in the following decade through his discovery of, and swooning admiration for, the torch song tradition.</p> <p>It was in the mid-1980s, when I started writing for the <em>NME</em>, that I first crossed paths with Penman. As I recall, he was in thrall to Tom Waits and seemed, from his dress sense (Waitsian) and drinking habits (Bukowskian), to be a man blissfully and wilfully out of time. Except that his writing style, to the dismay of many readers, was attuned to the contemporary frequency of continental lit theory \u2013 Barthes, Benjamin and Derrida the unlikely touchstones for his singular takes on the likes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/gallery/2018/nov/24/nicolas-roeg-a-life-in-pictures\" title=\"\">Nic Roeg</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/rickie-lee-jones\" title=\"\">Rickie Lee Jones</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/nov/13/paul-schrader-ive-been-involved-in-important-films-dog-eat-dog-interview\" title=\"\">Paul Schrader</a> and, less convincingly, it has to be said, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/sep/07/kid-creole-interview\" title=\"\">Kid Creole and the Coconuts</a>. It was stirring stuff, not least because it so divided opinion.</p> <p>Ultimately, its lasting import was of the viral variety, Penman\u2019s unapologetically cerebral style influencing several key music writers who came after him, from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2005/apr/17/music\" title=\"\">Simon Reynolds</a> to the late <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/18/mark-fisher-k-punk-blogs-did-48-politics\" title=\"\">Mark Fisher</a>, his prose seeming to cast as mesmeric a spell on his followers as the post-punk music that spawned it.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In many ways, Penman\u2019s abiding subject is pop fame as a kind of inexorable American tragedy</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As this book makes clear, though, Penman\u2019s musical and sartorial roots were shaped by, of all things, mod. This took me by surprise when I first read his magisterial essay <a href=\"https://www.lrb.co.uk/v35/n16/ian-penman/even-if-you-have-to-starve\" title=\"\">Even If You Have to Starve</a> in the <em>London Review of Books</em> in 2013. (The <em>LRB</em> is where the nomadic Penman has belatedly found his true home, his wonderfully discursive style unconstrained by the tyranny of the word count.) Like the other pieces here, it is an extended book review as essay, Penman celebrating the European and American roots of mod while lamenting what it has since become \u2013 a very British kind of doggedly faithful, but essentially meaningless, pop-cultural nostalgia. He moves deftly between the personal and the sociohistorical, touching on leisure, class and the peculiar conjunction of conformity and narcissism that shaped the original mod aesthetic. \u201cEarly mods had a deserved rep for sartorial aloofness,\u201d he writes, \u201cwhich shaded into a kind of radiant anonymity.\u201d</p> <p>There are arresting sentences such as this throughout the book. In his essay on Prince, Penman quips: \u201cIf too many soulful love songs, whatever their merits, are essentially Jack Vettriano, then 1980s Prince was Paul Klee.\u201d Pithy, yes, but totally on the money. Prince\u2019s purple reign \u2013 <em>Dirty Mind</em> (1980) to <em>Lovesexy</em> (1988) \u2013 so soundtracked Penman\u2019s pop life at that time that he can retrospectively \u201cplot all the high and low points of that shiny/dark hedonistic time using nothing but Prince songs\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Ian Penman\u2019s first volume of collected essays, published in 1998, was called Vital Signs: Music, Movies and Other Manias. Now, 20 years later, comes It Gets Me Home, This Curving Track. The titles tell a tale: the one denoting urgency and obsession; the other evoking a more contemplative mood, which is fitting for a book that ranges from the \u201cunearthly sonic signatures\u201d that bebop saxophonist Charlie Parker created in the 1940s to the \u201cplayfully dense personal mythology\u201d that so defined Prince\u2019s postmodern R&amp;B in the 1980s. The line \u201cit gets me home, this curving track\u201d is actually taken from a WH Auden poem, Walks, which, as Penman notes in his introduction, \u201cis a lovely description of spinning vinyl, and also words that might have sprung from any number of unkempt and long-favoured songs\u201d. Songs, in the traditional sense, have long fascinated Penman. He deconstructed them as a fleeting member of post-punk group Scritti Politti in the late 70s and came to revalue them in the following decade through his discovery of, and swooning admiration for, the torch song tradition. It was in the mid-1980s, when I started writing for the NME, that I first crossed paths with Penman. As I recall, he was in thrall to Tom Waits and seemed, from his dress sense (Waitsian) and drinking habits (Bukowskian), to be a man blissfully and wilfully out of time. Except that his writing style, to the dismay of many readers, was attuned to the contemporary frequency of continental lit theory \u2013 Barthes, Benjamin and Derrida the unlikely touchstones for his singular takes on the likes of Nic Roeg, Rickie Lee Jones, Paul Schrader and, less convincingly, it has to be said, Kid Creole and the Coconuts. It was stirring stuff, not least because it so divided opinion. Ultimately, its lasting import was of the viral variety, Penman\u2019s unapologetically cerebral style influencing several key music writers who came after him, from Simon Reynolds to the late Mark Fisher, his prose seeming to cast as mesmeric a spell on his followers as the post-punk music that spawned it. As this book makes clear, though, Penman\u2019s musical and sartorial roots were shaped by, of all things, mod. This took me by surprise when I first read his magisterial essay Even If You Have to Starve in the London Review of Books in 2013. (The LRB is where the nomadic Penman has belatedly found his true home, his wonderfully discursive style unconstrained by the tyranny of the word count.) Like the other pieces here, it is an extended book review as essay, Penman celebrating the European and American roots of mod while lamenting what it has since become \u2013 a very British kind of doggedly faithful, but essentially meaningless, pop-cultural nostalgia. He moves deftly between the personal and the sociohistorical, touching on leisure, class and the peculiar conjunction of conformity and narcissism that shaped the original mod aesthetic. \u201cEarly mods had a deserved rep for sartorial aloofness,\u201d he writes, \u201cwhich shaded into a kind of radiant anonymity.\u201d There are arresting sentences such as this throughout the book. In his essay on Prince, Penman quips: \u201cIf too many soulful love songs, whatever their merits, are essentially Jack Vettriano, then 1980s Prince was Paul Klee.\u201d Pithy, yes, but totally on the money. Prince\u2019s purple reign \u2013 Dirty Mind (1980) to Lovesexy (1988) \u2013 so soundtracked Penman\u2019s pop life at that time that he can retrospectively \u201cplot all the high and low points of that shiny/dark hedonistic time using nothing but Prince songs\u201d. His dissection of the singer\u2019s genius and his strangeness is definitive, by turns celebratory, critical and starkly elegiac: \u201cHe died in the middle of the night, when names and colours matter least.\u201d Penman\u2019s take on James Brown similarly pulls together all the stark contradictions that defined a self-styled, larger-than-life persona and measures the stellar success against \u201cthe heavy, soul-consuming price\u201d of a life lived in fame\u2019s destabilising orbit. The human dilemmas of that devil\u2019s contract are touched on, too, in Penman\u2019s meditations on Frank Sinatra, a fearsomely controlling presence with a gift for expressing a solitude so essential as to be almost tragic, and Charlie Parker, whose hurtling life exceeded even the frantic pace of his most furious extemporisations. In many ways, Penman\u2019s abiding subject is pop fame as a kind of inexorable American tragedy. For all that, it is his thoughts on two lesser-known, altogether more elusive, talents that I found most enthralling. The first is the late John Fahey, a blues obsessive and preternaturally gifted guitarist who transmuted the traditional into a new language, both eerily familiar and surprising. \u201cFahey merged the dark voodoo of the Delta blues with his own off-kilter sense of American self, nature and space,\u201d writes Penman, nailing the musician\u2019s otherness and his distinctive sensibility. Otherness of another kind informs the music of Donald Fagen, lead singer and co-songwriter of Steely Dan, whose irony-laced lyrics often evoke an older era when to be hip was not a stance but a kind of sacred calling. Not so any more. \u201cToday, when we identify a hipster,\u201d writes Penman, \u201cit carries entirely different connotations from the word\u2019s original, darkly lustrous charge. \u2018Hipster\u2019 is now a slight, because hipsters now are slight\u2026 Once, though, it truly mattered how hip you were\u2026 It was a dark and uncertain thing, an arduous rite of passage, almost a spiritual gamble.\u201d It is the echoes of that spiritual gamble, and the wealth of secret knowledge attained in that arduous rite of passage, that resonate throughout It Gets Me Home, This Curving Track and make it such an essential read.

      "body": "<p>As the campaign for the White House gears up and the struggle over Brexit becomes ever more intense, we\u2019re inundated with spin, fake news and alternative facts. Techniques of persuasion \u2013 which the ancient Greeks called the science of rhetoric \u2013 are very much alive.</p> <p>Homer\u2019s <strong>Iliad</strong> (8th century BC) opens with the dispute between Agamemnon and Achilles pitching inherited power against proven merit. But systematic studies of rhetoric, and realisations that it empowered immoral people, then emerged with 5th-century democracies. Barry Unsworth\u2019s 2002 novel <strong>The Songs of the Kings</strong> retold the <em>Iliad</em> and Euripides\u2019 <em>Iphigenia in Aulis</em> to skewer the sophisticated spin of New Labour, especially Peter Mandelson. Agamemnon\u2019s chief strategist is Odysseus, whose \u201cown fluency betrayed him sometimes, when he felt the excitement of the prospect, through words alone, of prevailing over another mind, using the fears and desires of that mind to disarm and control it\u201d.</p> <p>Plato concluded that rhetoric dangerously prioritised influencing opinion over the pursuit of truth. But his pragmatic student Aristotle opened his <strong>Rhetoric</strong> with a refutation: we all need to persuade others of our views and understand techniques of debate to analyse the claims made by would- be leaders. Rhetoric has no immanent morality.

      "bodyText": "As the campaign for the White House gears up and the struggle over Brexit becomes ever more intense, we\u2019re inundated with spin, fake news and alternative facts. Techniques of persuasion \u2013 which the ancient Greeks called the science of rhetoric \u2013 are very much alive. Homer\u2019s Iliad (8th century BC) opens with the dispute between Agamemnon and Achilles pitching inherited power against proven merit. But systematic studies of rhetoric, and realisations that it empowered immoral people, then emerged with 5th-century democracies. Barry Unsworth\u2019s 2002 novel The Songs of the Kings retold the Iliad and Euripides\u2019 Iphigenia in Aulis to skewer the sophisticated spin of New Labour, especially Peter Mandelson. Agamemnon\u2019s chief strategist is Odysseus, whose \u201cown fluency betrayed him sometimes, when he felt the excitement of the prospect, through words alone, of prevailing over another mind, using the fears and desires of that mind to disarm and control it\u201d. Plato concluded that rhetoric dangerously prioritised influencing opinion over the pursuit of truth. But his pragmatic student Aristotle opened his Rhetoric with a refutation: we all need to persuade others of our views and understand techniques of debate to analyse the claims made by would- be leaders. Rhetoric has no immanent morality. It can be used for good as well as evil. The best book on the debate between Plato and the orators, and its post-Renaissance continuation, is Brian Vickers\u2019s In Defence of Rhetoric, with its useful appendix describing the rhetorical figures identified in antiquity and still in constant use today (anaphora, metonymy and so on). The instrumentality of ancient speechmaking in the political oratory of more recent times is also explored in Gary Wills\u2019s Lincoln at Gettysburg: The Words that Remade America. Wills examines the inspiration behind Abraham Lincoln\u2019s 1863 address at the Soldiers\u2019 National Cemetery in Pennsylvania \u2013 Pericles\u2019 oration at the funeral of the Athenian war dead of 431BC, recorded by Thucydides. Pericles rousingly concluded, \u201cSuch is the city for whose sake these men nobly fought and died; they could not bear the thought that she might be taken from them; and every one of us who survive should gladly toil on her behalf.\u201d Lincoln praised not the dead but the principles on which their country was founded. Wills argues that his speech was revolutionary in assuming that the Declaration of Independence, not the Constitution, was the supreme articulation of American government. He proposed that the US is a single nation and a single people, rather than an association of separate states. Lincoln follows Pericles in grasping a historic opportunity to frame a vision of his whole community and its values. He also followed the classical structure of Pericles\u2019 oration in discussing first the dead and secondly the living \u2013 survivors, the bereaved \u2013 and instructing them on their future.

Ramen was cheap, plentiful and, thanks to the automated ordering machines, easy. He was hooked. But his hobby became an obsession, and within a few years he was writing articles on the subject and appearing on TV as an expert. In 2016, he helped open <a href=\"http://mensho.tokyo\" title=\"\">Mensho Tokyo SF</a> in San Francisco with master ramen chef Tomoharu Shono.</p> <p>Noticing a lack of English-language resources for ramen novices in Japan, Plaut teamed up with friends and fellow noodle aficionados <strong>Hiroshi Shimakage</strong> and <strong>Patrick Brzeski</strong>, the Hollywood Reporter\u2019s Asia bureau chief, to launch <a href=\"http://ramenbeast.com\" title=\"\">Ramen Beast</a>, a free-to-use app with hundreds of independent listings designed to help confused outsiders navigate Tokyo\u2019s complex ramen subculture.</p> <p>\u201cThe volume and diversity of ramen shops in Tokyo can be overwhelming,\u201d Brzeski says (few have websites), \u201cbut it\u2019s also incredibly inspiring.\u201d Between the three of them, he estimates they\u2019ve eaten at several thousand places, ranging from mum-and-dad operations to a Michelin-starred number where bowls come dusted with fresh truffle shavings.</p> <p>\u201cIn this one food scene, you could eat a new gourmet meal for under \u00a310 every day for the rest of your life,\u201d Brzeski adds.</p> <p>Out of more than 10,000 ramen joints in the city, here are 10 the trio say should be on your culinary hit list.</p> <h2><strong>Konjiki Hototogisu</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"232466316d17fc6325840890d45b34e118c86e4f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/232466316d17fc6325840890d45b34e118c86e4f/0_447_2636_1582/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ramen bowl with whole egg in still in shell.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>\u201cExpect premium ingredients artfully crafted into perfectly balanced bowls,\u201d Shimakage says. \u201cThe master, Yamamoto-san, is known as one of the first ramen chefs to use <em>hamaguri</em> clams in his signature soup.\u201d These bivalves, along with a touch of sea bream, add an evocative depth to the broth. Although Konjiki Hototogisu became Tokyo\u2019s third ramen joint to win a Michelin star last year, the Ramen Beast crew have been fans of Yamamoto\u2019s <em>shio</em> ramen since he was serving out of a tiny eight-seat shop. Fame hasn\u2019t gone to the master chef\u2019s head, though, or diminished his food\u2019s superb quality. \u201cLight, clean, delicate, yet bursting with umami, this bowl is not one to be missed,\u201d Shimakage says.<br><em>\u2022 2-4-1 Shinjuku, 22 Kyutei Mansion 1F, Shinjuku, +81 3 5315 4733, </em><em>daily 11.30am-3pm, 6.30pm-10pm</em></p> <h2><strong>Menya Shichisai</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aa1ad307147010ffcf9ea2c27c01feecfbe8aa56\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aa1ad307147010ffcf9ea2c27c01feecfbe8aa56/0_656_3024_1814/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Menya Shono Shop seen from outside with menu board\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>\u201cOnce you give your ticket, the guy kneads out the dough and then cuts the noodles fresh, which is somewhat uncommon in the ramen game,\u201d Plaut says.

Chef Naohito Kuroki\u2019s fine-dining roots can be seen in his fanatical attention to detail.

Order a cold Sapporo to wash down incendiary bowls loaded with fiery ingredients from around the globe. \u201cThe soup here references spicy miso ramen, but it has so many exotic flavours melded together that it\u2019s a bowl without a genre.

Fame hasn\u2019t gone to the master chef\u2019s head, though, or diminished his food\u2019s superb quality. \u201cLight, clean, delicate, yet bursting with umami, this bowl is not one to be missed,\u201d Shimakage says. \u2022 2-4-1 Shinjuku, 22 Kyutei Mansion 1F, Shinjuku, +81 3 5315 4733, daily 11.30am-3pm, 6.30pm-10pm Menya Shichisai \u201cOnce you give your ticket, the guy kneads out the dough and then cuts the noodles fresh, which is somewhat uncommon in the ramen game,\u201d Plaut says. It\u2019s mesmerising to watch these toothsome tangles materialise before your eyes. \u201cThis is one of the most famous shops serving kitakata ramen in Tokyo,\u201d Plaut adds. This style, originally hailing from Fukushima prefecture, consists of a clear soup with rustic, wavy noodles laced with a funky undertone of niboshi (dried sardines). \u2022 2 Chome-13-2 Hatchobori, Chuo, +81 3 5566 9355, Mon-Fri 11am-3pm, 5pm-10pm; Sat-Sun 11am-3pm, 5pm-9pm, on Facebook Mensho Tokyo With nine shops spread across the city, each with a distinct menu and concept, chef Tomoharu Shono \u2013 who expanded the chain to San Francisco with Plaut\u2019s help \u2013 holds a place of reverence in the world of Tokyo ramen and has a reputation for daring combos, such as lamb spiked with dark chocolate, reminiscent of Mexican mole. \u201cThe speciality at this flagship branch is a tonkotsu gyokai [pork bone and dried fish] soup \u2013 umami-rich and simply outstanding,\u201d says Plaut. \u2022 1 Chome-15-9 Kasuga, Bunkyo City, +81 3 3830 0842, Wed-Mon 11am-3pm, 5pm-11pm, menya-shono.com Motenashi Kuroki \u201cVisit this shop on Fridays, when the daily house speciality is ramen or tsukemen [dipping noodles] made with a duck-based shoyu soup topped with juicy slabs of duck meat and a thin wedge of kabosu citrus fruit,\u201d Plaut says. Chef Naohito Kuroki\u2019s fine-dining roots can be seen in his fanatical attention to detail. During the rest of the week, patrons at the 13-seater have to content themselves with the classic shio, made with a custom blend of six types of salt, or his seasonal hiyashi chuka (cold noodles). \u2022 2-15 Kanda Izumicho, Chiyoda, +81 3-3863 7117, Mon-Tues, Thur, Sat 11.30am-3pm, 6pm-9pm; Fri 11.30am-2.30pm, 6pm-8.30pm Supaisu Ramen Manriki \u201cAs soon as you walk through the door, you\u2019ll get a blast of this shop\u2019s signature spices,\u201d Plaut says. Order a cold Sapporo to wash down incendiary bowls loaded with fiery ingredients from around the globe. \u201cThe soup here references spicy miso ramen, but it has so many exotic flavours melded together that it\u2019s a bowl without a genre. Red chilli and Sichuan peppercorns deliver the kick, while Indian curry notes keep you guessing.\u201d \u2022 3-16-5 Nishi-Kasai, Edogawa-ku, +81 3 6848 1346, Thur-Tues 11.30am-9.30pm, manriki.net Menson Rage When Menson Rage stepped on to the scene in 2015, its chefs took classic ramen conventions and tossed them out of the window. The result is a hip, laid-back space serving revelatory bowls of noodles. Squeeze past the parked bikes and skateboards into a modern restaurant where the shop\u2019s master, a \u201cfriendly young dude named Hirota-san, prepares incredibly refined shoyu ramen made using a type of fighting cock originally from Thailand\u201d, Brzeski says. \u2022 3 Chome-37-22 Shoan, Suginami, Mon, Wed-Sat 11am-3pm, 6pm-9pm, Sun 11am-4pm Mugi To Olive These noodles get a savoury kick from an unconventional source. \u201cOnce you\u2019ve eaten about half your bowl, grab one of the bottles of olive oil sitting on the counter and add a generous splash,\u201d Plaut says. It might sound strange, but it works. \u201cThe virgin oil harmonises surprisingly well with the house speciality soup, made from chicken with niboshi and hamaguri clams, while altering the flavour profile of the dish.\u201d \u2022 6-12-12 Ginza, Chuo-ku, +81 3-3571-2123, Mon-Fri 11.30am-10pm, Sat 11.30am-9pm Uchoku Word spread fast about this slick arrival that debuted at the end of 2018. Ramen is available, but the speciality here is the dipping variety, tsukemen, which comes with a lovely soup made with skipjack tuna, kombu (seaweed) and chicken for dipping. After you\u2019ve slurped up your house-made noodles, pour a little extra dashi into the rich stock to dilute it, then drink it down to the last drop. \u2022 3-10-16 Amanuma, Suginami-ku, Mon-Fri 11.30am-3pm, Sat-Sun 11.30am-4pm Teppanyaki Kishin \u201cOriginally, Teppanyaki Kishin wasn\u2019t even a ramen shop, but a traditional iron-griddle joint. However, several months after it opened in 2016, it started offering a special ramen menu at lunchtime \u2013 and the idea is genius,\u201d Plaut says. For those with fancier tastes, an indulgent bowl topped with blood-rare slices of Kobe beef should hit the spot. \u2022 17-10 Sarugakucho, Shibuya-ku, +81 3 6427 0952, Mon-Fri 11am-11pm, Sat-Sun noon-11pm Homemade Muginae A smash hit since it opened in 2016, Muginae is known for its luscious broth made from free-range Yamagata chickens. Details matter here, which is why the chefs exclusively use Japanese flour for their springy, house-made noodles, as well as two kinds of shoyu from Hyogo and Nagano prefectures for the explosively flavourful tare (seasoning). All that care adds up to shoyu ramen that stands out from the masses. \u2022 6 Chome-11-10 Minamioi, Shinagawa City, +81 3 3298 5158, Sat-Sun 11.30am-3pm, Mon-Wed and Fri 11.30am-2.30pm, 6pm till sold out Browse the Guardian\u2019s selection of foodie holidays on the Guardian Holidays website",

A similar principle has been demonstrated with products such as liquor: people will spend extra because they want to say Grey Goose to the bartender or display the bottle on their table.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c431d9b42bef52eb4c534e8f896e5b7ccef20aba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c431d9b42bef52eb4c534e8f896e5b7ccef20aba/0_0_900_900/500.jpg\" alt=\"Some cannabis companies are aiming to become prestige brands.\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Some cannabis companies are aiming to become prestige brands.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: George Wylesol/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There\u2019s a lot of money betting similar principles will apply to cannabis. Beboe was acquired this year by <a href=\"https://www.gtigrows.com/\">Green Thumb Industries</a>, a company in Chicago. CannDescent just raised $27.5m from investors.</p> <p>Some cannabis companies telegraph their chicness by hugging the earth as tightly as possible. As a federally illegal drug, cannabis can\u2019t be certified organic by the US government, but the Colorado company <a href=\"https://leagledenver.com/\">L\u2019Eagle</a> (pronounced \u201clegal\u201d) pays an independent firm to audit the crop it sells at its dispensary, which its co-owner Amy Andrle describes as more farm-to-table than Apple Store. The company offers \u201cthe luxury of knowing what you\u2019re putting in your body\u201d, she said, not just \u201ca beautiful box\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s a pitch with obvious appeal for what the industry likes to call a \u201cwellness\u201d product. And it may grow in resonance. In recent weeks, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/sep/06/vaping-illness-breathing-us-health-officials\">hundreds across the US</a> have become severely ill and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/sep/13/vaping-deaths-in-the-us-what-do-you-need-to-know\">six have died</a> from a severe respiratory disease that may be linked to vaping.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"instagram embed\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot;

      "bodyText": "Despite being expensive and sometimes rare, cannabis isn\u2019t typically considered a luxury good. It\u2019s too closely associated with slovenly, underperforming young men to convey wealth or style. But as cannabis becomes more acceptable and the consumer base grows to include more women and affluent professionals, some companies are aiming to become prestige brands. With limited opportunities to advertise, packaging is one of the few ways a brand can catch a customer\u2019s eye. It\u2019s also how aspiring top-shelf brands signal their ambitions. California\u2019s Canndescent, which calls itself \u201cultra-premium\u201d, uses a burnt orange motif in a nod to the French fashion house Hermes. Another California brand, Beboe, was co-founded by a celebrity tattoo artist, Scott Campbell, and its pastille edibles \u2013 \u201ccandy tarts of bouginess\u201d \u2013 come in lovely little tins. Many dispensaries try to attract affluent shoppers by fashioning themselves after art galleries and boutiques. The self-selecting group of luxury cannabis brands often charge more than their competitors, even though it\u2019s fair to assume many of their customers can\u2019t tell the difference in how they taste, let alone the highs they produce. A similar principle has been demonstrated with products such as liquor: people will spend extra because they want to say Grey Goose to the bartender or display the bottle on their table. There\u2019s a lot of money betting similar principles will apply to cannabis. Beboe was acquired this year by Green Thumb Industries, a company in Chicago. CannDescent just raised $27.5m from investors. Some cannabis companies telegraph their chicness by hugging the earth as tightly as possible. As a federally illegal drug, cannabis can\u2019t be certified organic by the US government, but the Colorado company L\u2019Eagle (pronounced \u201clegal\u201d) pays an independent firm to audit the crop it sells at its dispensary, which its co-owner Amy Andrle describes as more farm-to-table than Apple Store. The company offers \u201cthe luxury of knowing what you\u2019re putting in your body\u201d, she said, not just \u201ca beautiful box\u201d. It\u2019s a pitch with obvious appeal for what the industry likes to call a \u201cwellness\u201d product. And it may grow in resonance. In recent weeks, hundreds across the US have become severely ill and six have died from a severe respiratory disease that may be linked to vaping. Just as several cannabis companies have tilted at luxury, a handful of celebrated luxury brands have waved back. The plush department store Barney\u2019s has opened a head shop called The High End at its Beverly Hills location and online. It sells accessories like a sterling silver Mini Bic Lighter Case by Good Art Hlywd for $625, and a set of 10 pre-rolled paper cones for joints from the French paper house Devambez, which traces its roots to 1826, for $78. Barney\u2019s has also formed a partnership with Sherbinskis, a California cannabis company which, thanks to its ties to rappers and other tastemakers, has a mystique similar to the streetwear brand Supreme. The High End also sells a selection of CBD lotions and cannabis scents. It\u2019s true: several perfumers have embraced an aroma widely considered to be as alluring as a suburban basement. The Demeter Fragrance Library describes its cannabis flower fragrance as \u201cslightly floral, slightly spicy ... a deep and penetrating beauty\u201d inspired by Bob Marley and \u201ca misspent youth\u201d. The cannabis jewelry line Genifer M, which styles pieces shaped like cannabis leaves, recently made its New York fashion week debut at a show put on by designer Korto Momolu, who\u2019s best known from Project Runway. There\u2019s also a market of unknown size for what might be called canna-bling. The vaporizer company Double Barrel sells a $100,000 model encrusted in diamonds and white gold, in a camouflage pattern. A company called Shine produces rolling papers made from hemp and \u201cthe finest edible gold\u201d for the relative bargain of $10 per sheet. While luxury products will probably find some foothold, one entrepreneur expressed skepticism that the existing brands would be the eventual winners. Jason Osni likened luxury brands in the current market to \u201ccasting Daniel Day Lewis in a high school musical\u201d. Instead he founded a more affordable brand called \u201cOld Pal\u201d, which he describes as appealing and within reach.

      "body": "<h2>Top story: \u2018Dense and destructive\u2019</h2> \n<p>Good morning and welcome to this Monday morning briefing with Alison Rourke at the start of what will be another Brexit-dominated week.</p> \n<p>As Boris Johnson heads to Luxembourg today for talks with the EU commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, No 10 has struck a combative mood. A Downing Street source said that Johnson would \u201cstress to Mr Juncker that, while he wants to secure a deal, if no deal can be agreed by 18 October his policy is to leave without a deal on 31 October \u2013 and reject any delay offered by the EU\u201d. In turn, Juncker is expected to ask Johnson to spell out his ideas for replacing the Irish backstop, the key issue in any new Brexit deal. The lunch meeting with Juncker comes 26 days after Johnson met Angela Merkel in Berlin and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/aug/21/brexit-latest-news-boris-johnson-berlin-merkel-prepares-to-visit-berlin-as-minister-struggles-to-defend-his-collaborators-jibe-live-news?page=with:block-5d5d7e5d8f081cf11cf1a9ae#block-5d5d7e5d8f081cf11cf1a9ae\">declared he had 30 days</a> to persuade the EU there was a viable alternative to the backstop. EU officials poured scorn on Johnson\u2019s assertion that, like the Incredible Hulk, he was poised to break free of the EU\u2019s \u201cmanacles\u201d. Guy Verhofstadt, the chief <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a> representative for the European parliament, tweeted that the remarks were \u201cinfantile\u201d. A bigger ticking off came from Mark Ruffalo, the actor who plays the Marvel superhero: \u201cBoris Johnson forgets that the Hulk only fights for the good of the whole. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/15/hulk-actor-smashes-pms-attempt-at-incredible-metaphor\">Mad and strong can also be dense and destructive</a>,\u201d he tweeted.</p> \n<p>Peter Walker writes that Labour will face increased pressure from local party activists to adopt a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/15/labour-members-to-push-for-anti-brexit-stance-at-conference\">more wholehearted anti-Brexit stance</a> at its upcoming conference, according to an analysis of submitted motions, which shows 90% want the party to openly back remain in any future referendum. Meanwhile, only half of UK universities are ready for a no-deal Brexit, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/sep/16/only-half-of-uk-universities-ready-for-no-deal-brexit-study\">according to a survey by Universities UK</a>, with 80% of universities worried about the impact of crashing out of the EU without a deal.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>\u2018Locked and loaded\u2019</strong> \u2013 Donald Trump says he\u2019s ready to respond to the drone attacks on an oil processing plant in Saudi Arabia, saying he has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/16/trump-says-us-locked-and-loaded-after-saudi-arabia-oil-attack-as-crude-prices-soar-iran-aramco\">\u201creason to believe that we know the culprit\u201d</a> behind them. In a tweet last night Trump said the US was \u201clocked and loaded depending on verification, but are waiting to hear from the Kingdom [of Saudi Arabia] as to who they believe was the cause of this attack and under what terms we would proceed!\u201d. Meanwhile oil prices have soared in the wake of the attack to reach six-month highs. Brent crude oil, the international benchmark, gained almost $12 a barrel, reaching up to $71.95 a barrel, before dropping back to $68 a barrel. Iran denies it was behind the drone attacks on Saturday.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>\u2018Dehumanising\u2019 </strong>\u2013 The government\u2019s chief adviser on extremism, Sara Khan, has called the language used by Boris Johnson to describe Muslim women \u201cdemeaning\u201d and \u201cdehumanising\u201d, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/sep/16/pms-burqa-jibes-dehumanising-says-governments-extremism-adviser\">warned that politicians and the media risk provoking violence through their rhetoric.</a> Khan criticised the use of inflammatory phrases and terms such as \u201cenemies of the people\u201d and \u201csaboteurs\u201d \u2013 both of which featured in Daily Mail headlines \u2013 in political discourse. Asked if it was wrong for the prime minister to liken Muslim women wearing burqas to \u201cbank robbers\u201d and \u201cletterboxes\u201d as he did in a Daily Telegraph column in 2018, she said: \u201cPoliticians from across the divide need to be very careful of their language,\u201d adding that inflammatory language was \u201cdeeply unhelpful\u201d.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Farm subsidies</strong> \u2013 Just 1% of the $700bn-a-year subsidies given to farmers is being used to benefit the environment, according to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/16/1m-a-minute-the-farming-subsidies-destroying-the-world\">a new report by the Food and Land Use Coalition (Folu)</a>. Instead, most of it goes to promoting high-emission cattle production, forest destruction and pollution from the overuse of fertiliser. The report rejects the idea that subsidies are needed to supply cheap food and found that the cost of the damage currently caused by agriculture is greater than the value of the food produced. It also finds that producing healthy, sustainable food would actually cut food prices, as the condition of the land improved. \u201cThere is incredibly small direct targeting of [subsidies at] positive environment outcomes, which is insane,\u201d said Jeremy Oppenheim, principal at (Folu). \u201cWe have got to switch these subsidies into explicitly positive measures.\u201d</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Work rights </strong>\u2013 More than a million workers in Britain do not receive any of the holiday pay according to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/sep/16/more-than-1m-uk-workers-denied-legal-holiday-pay-analysis\">report by the Resolution Foundation thinktank</a>. It found that as many as one in 20 workers did not receive <strong>any holiday pay </strong>despite being legally entitled to at least 28 days a year. According to the research, almost one in 10 workers do not receive a legally required payslip, making it hard for them to calculate whether they are receiving the right level of pay, pension and holiday and to check for any deductions.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Roman beef</strong> \u2013 A fourth-century Romano-British butcher\u2019s business unearthed at Ipplepen in south Devon has beefed up the case for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/sep/16/remains-of-ancient-butchers-beef-up-case-for-redrawing-map-of-roman-empire\">redrawing the map of the Roman empire</a>. Experts believe the business was set up to prepare the best cuts of beef that were transported to customers miles away along a Roman road found at the site. The discovery of a ditch full of 1,700-year-old cattle bones has undermined the notion that ancient Rome\u2019s influence had not stretched further south-west in the British Isles than Exeter, 20 miles to the north of the site.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"faf316c5462a64c70c6ee4d470ac3ae653011ce3\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/faf316c5462a64c70c6ee4d470ac3ae653011ce3/719_26_4457_2674/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The remains of a high-quality Roman -British butcher\u2019s business and centre for crafts have been unearthed by archaeologists in Devon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The remains of a high-quality Romano-British butcher\u2019s business unearthed by archaeologists in Devon.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Today in Focus podcast: Edward Snowden: life after leaking</h2> \n<p>Former US intelligence contractor Edward Snowden\u2019s life was upended by his decision to expose his government\u2019s programme of mass surveillance.

      "bodyText": "Top story: \u2018Dense and destructive\u2019 Good morning and welcome to this Monday morning briefing with Alison Rourke at the start of what will be another Brexit-dominated week. As Boris Johnson heads to Luxembourg today for talks with the EU commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, No 10 has struck a combative mood. A Downing Street source said that Johnson would \u201cstress to Mr Juncker that, while he wants to secure a deal, if no deal can be agreed by 18 October his policy is to leave without a deal on 31 October \u2013 and reject any delay offered by the EU\u201d. In turn, Juncker is expected to ask Johnson to spell out his ideas for replacing the Irish backstop, the key issue in any new Brexit deal. The lunch meeting with Juncker comes 26 days after Johnson met Angela Merkel in Berlin and declared he had 30 days to persuade the EU there was a viable alternative to the backstop. EU officials poured scorn on Johnson\u2019s assertion that, like the Incredible Hulk, he was poised to break free of the EU\u2019s \u201cmanacles\u201d. Guy Verhofstadt, the chief Brexit representative for the European parliament, tweeted that the remarks were \u201cinfantile\u201d. A bigger ticking off came from Mark Ruffalo, the actor who plays the Marvel superhero: \u201cBoris Johnson forgets that the Hulk only fights for the good of the whole. Mad and strong can also be dense and destructive,\u201d he tweeted. Peter Walker writes that Labour will face increased pressure from local party activists to adopt a more wholehearted anti-Brexit stance at its upcoming conference, according to an analysis of submitted motions, which shows 90% want the party to openly back remain in any future referendum. Meanwhile, only half of UK universities are ready for a no-deal Brexit, according to a survey by Universities UK, with 80% of universities worried about the impact of crashing out of the EU without a deal. * * * \u2018Locked and loaded\u2019 \u2013 Donald Trump says he\u2019s ready to respond to the drone attacks on an oil processing plant in Saudi Arabia, saying he has \u201creason to believe that we know the culprit\u201d behind them. In a tweet last night Trump said the US was \u201clocked and loaded depending on verification, but are waiting to hear from the Kingdom [of Saudi Arabia] as to who they believe was the cause of this attack and under what terms we would proceed!\u201d. Meanwhile oil prices have soared in the wake of the attack to reach six-month highs. Brent crude oil, the international benchmark, gained almost $12 a barrel, reaching up to $71.95 a barrel, before dropping back to $68 a barrel. Iran denies it was behind the drone attacks on Saturday. * * * \u2018Dehumanising\u2019 \u2013 The government\u2019s chief adviser on extremism, Sara Khan, has called the language used by Boris Johnson to describe Muslim women \u201cdemeaning\u201d and \u201cdehumanising\u201d, and warned that politicians and the media risk provoking violence through their rhetoric. Khan criticised the use of inflammatory phrases and terms such as \u201cenemies of the people\u201d and \u201csaboteurs\u201d \u2013 both of which featured in Daily Mail headlines \u2013 in political discourse. Asked if it was wrong for the prime minister to liken Muslim women wearing burqas to \u201cbank robbers\u201d and \u201cletterboxes\u201d as he did in a Daily Telegraph column in 2018, she said: \u201cPoliticians from across the divide need to be very careful of their language,\u201d adding that inflammatory language was \u201cdeeply unhelpful\u201d. * * * Farm subsidies \u2013 Just 1% of the $700bn-a-year subsidies given to farmers is being used to benefit the environment, according to a new report by the Food and Land Use Coalition (Folu).

It found that as many as one in 20 workers did not receive any holiday pay despite being legally entitled to at least 28 days a year. According to the research, almost one in 10 workers do not receive a legally required payslip, making it hard for them to calculate whether they are receiving the right level of pay, pension and holiday and to check for any deductions. * * * Roman beef \u2013 A fourth-century Romano-British butcher\u2019s business unearthed at Ipplepen in south Devon has beefed up the case for redrawing the map of the Roman empire. Experts believe the business was set up to prepare the best cuts of beef that were transported to customers miles away along a Roman road found at the site. The discovery of a ditch full of 1,700-year-old cattle bones has undermined the notion that ancient Rome\u2019s influence had not stretched further south-west in the British Isles than Exeter, 20 miles to the north of the site.

      "bodyText": "The Australian Capital Territory plans to phase out natural gas, electrify its bus fleets and public school buildings, and introduce incentives for drivers who buy electric cars. The ACT government announced its climate strategy for 2019-25 on Monday, with several nation-first policies it said would further the territory\u2019s \u201cglobal leading climate efforts\u201d. The ACT chief minister, Andrew Barr, said the plan had significant environmental objectives as the territory moved to cut emissions by 50-60% on 1990 levels by 2025, and transition to net zero emissions by 2045. But he said the territory also wanted to make sure the transition was \u201ca just one for our community\u201d that capitalised on the economic development opportunities of shifting to a carbon-neutral economy. \u201cAt a high level I think it demonstrates national leadership, international leadership in certain areas, and provides us with a very clear, considered pathway forward as we respond to the challenges of climate change,\u201d Barr said. Barr said there was public appetite for change and \u201ca lot of distress at the lack of action at a national level\u201d as the impacts of the climate crisis became more visible. \u201cRightly there is a focus on state and territory and local governments to show some leadership here and to work with their local communities, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing,\u201d he said. The government said a number of its proposals were firsts for an Australian jurisdiction. They include the development of a plan to achieve net zero emissions from gas by 2045, applying a social cost of carbon in government procurement and capital works, and meeting the ACT\u2019s emissions reduction targets without the purchase of offsets. Under the plan, all new ACT public schools and government buildings would be 100% powered by renewable electricity and the territory\u2019s bus fleet will be entirely electric by 2040. The ACT is due to achieve its target of 100% renewable-generated electricity on 1 October. The next wave of policy is focused on transport and gas because those sectors make up 61% and 22% of the territory\u2019s emissions respectively. But the government acknowledged that drastically reducing emissions from those sectors would require behavioural change from the community. In the case of transport, 95% of the territory\u2019s emissions come from privately owned vehicles. The new strategy says the uptake of electric vehicles will naturally increase as they move closer to cost parity with petrol and diesel in coming years, but also notes it will require incentives for drivers to speed up that transition. The government said it would also have to invest more in infrastructure that will \u201cCopenhagenise\u201d the city by encouraging walking and cycling. The ACT\u2019s climate change and sustainability minister, Shane Rattenbury, said the plan was aimed at preparing the national capital for \u201ca hotter and drier future\u201d. In January the ACT recorded four consecutive days above 40C \u2013 a record for the capital \u2013 and its mean maximum was a record breaking 34.5C (6.3C above average). The new climate strategy includes a 30% tree canopy target to reduce the impacts of urban heat and a 30% surface permeability target \u2013 that is, surfaces made from materials that retain more moisture. It also proposes assistance for low-income residents and retraining of workers in affected industries. \u201cWe will need to work with the community,\u201d Rattenbury said. But he said it was \u201cimperative we make these changes\u201d because without action \u201cpeople\u2019s lives will change for the worse whether they like it or not\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "A Victorian private school allegedly pressured a teacher to resign for personally disagreeing with the college\u2019s anti-marriage equality stance, because of fears parents would pull their children out if they found out her true beliefs. Rachel Colvin was an English teacher at Ballarat Christian College from 2008 until February 2019. Colvin said that in August last year the school informed her she would no longer be offered certain teaching and professional development opportunities, despite her offer to keep silent about her personal support for same sex marriage. She said she was required to attend counselling sessions with the head of teaching and school chaplain. Colvin has lodged a discrimination case with the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal under the state\u2019s Equal Opportunity Act 2010. The tribunal is yet to list the case for a directions date or hearing. Equality Australia is providing support to Colvin in pursuing the case. \u201cI loved my job. I am an extremely hard worker and loyal to a fault, and to have it end the way it did was, at first, professionally humiliating,\u201d Colvin said in a statement. \u201cI see it as a God-given opportunity to stand up for what is right, to represent what God is really about: loving others.\u201d Guardian Australia understands that Colvin\u2019s statement of claim alleges the school told her in a meeting last year that parents would leave if they found out she was teaching at the college with her pro-marriage equality beliefs. Colvin, a committed Christian and mother of three, said she\u2019s bringing the case to let LGBT students know that they aren\u2019t \u201cdeformed\u201d. \u201cThey were created as they are, in the image of God, and that they are fully loved by God and share equal dignity with all human beings,\u201d she said. The school updated its constitution last year following the legalising of same sex marriage in 2017. \u201cGod designed the two genders, male and female, for the purpose of joy and procreation within the sole relationship of marriage. So a marriage can only be between a male and a female, and upon this foundation alone should children be conceived and families formed,\u201d the clause says. Colvin, who grew up in an evangelical Christian family in the US and has served as a missionary, refused to support that statement of faith. The school declined to comment, referring media enquiries to Christian Schools Australia spokesman, Mark Spencer. \u201cIt\u2019s completely come out of the blue for the school,\u201d Spencer told Guardian Australia. \u201cThis is fundamentally a claim around whether Christian and other faith based schools can continue to hold and teach their beliefs around this and other issues of importance to them.\u201d He said the statement of faith was standard across Christian schools. Spencer disputed the claim Colvin was capable of teaching the school\u2019s view of marriage. \u201cEven if you accept that claim \u2026 that\u2019s calling upon her to fundamentally lie to the students,\u201d he said. \u201cStudents will see through that. The next question will be \u2018what do you think Miss?\u2019 We don\u2019t want teachers to teach something that they don\u2019t believe in.\u201d Asked what message the saga sends to same sex students at the school Spencer said: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t send any message. The school has strong pastoral care policies and cares for all of its students. \u201cYou can still care for people and love them even though you have different beliefs.\u201d In 2015, the school was vandalised and closed for a day after the principal had urged the school community to oppose marriage equality in an email to parents. The general secretary of the Victorian Independent Education Union, Debra James, said in statement: \u201cIt is not acceptable for a worker to be forced out of employment simply for refusing to support a divisive statement which is at odds with their own beliefs and out of step with values of tolerance and inclusivity. \u201cFaith-based schools are entitled to affirm their own beliefs, but it is clearly a step too far to require educators to expressly support values or statements that they believe are in conflict with their duty of care towards their students.\u201d The case comes as the federal government pushes ahead with a controversial religious discrimination bill and as former rugby star Israel Folau takes legal action against Rugby Australia claiming unfair dismissal on religious grounds. Folau\u2019s multimillion dollar contract was terminated over a social media post in which he paraphrased a Bible passage, saying \u201cdrunks, homosexuals, adulterers, liars, fornicators, thieves, atheists and idolaters\u201d would go to hell unless they repented.",

Undergraduates at the Royal College of Music in London had to wait the longest to start counselling last year, with the worst case being 84 days, figures collected by British universities show. Sir Norman Lamb, the ex-health minister who obtained the data, said such long delays for care for conditions such as anxiety and depression could prove seriously damaging to undergraduates. \u201cTwelve-week delays to start counselling are scandalous, particularly when we know that so many students are taking their own lives,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s longer than a university term. \u201cIt\u2019s extraordinary that some universities are subjecting students to such long waits and failing their student populations so badly.\u201d \u201cUniversities with these long waiting times need to remember that students suffering from mental health conditions very often need help as a matter of real urgency. The risk is that their mental welfare will decline even further while they wait and wait for care and support,\u201d he added. Despite the growing demand for care, one in four universities have cut or frozen their budgets for student mental health, Lamb also found, although not all universities supplied full data. The University of Plymouth had the second-longest waiting times last year, with the worst case 66 days \u2013 though it stressed that the students involved had been offered earlier appointments. At Edinburgh Napier university, students waited up to 57 days for counselling and 112 days to start cognitive behavioural therapy, the research shows. Other institutions with notably long delays in the worst cases included the Royal College of Art in London (56 days), Bournemouth University (44 days in the term until December 2018) and the University of Salford (42 days). The findings come as hundreds of thousands of young people across the UK prepare to start a degree course at university, with most living away from home for the first time. Lamb\u2019s results, based on responses received to freedom of information requests, also found that students at some universities are facing average waits of up to 52 days in their quest to get psychological support. That average delay \u2013 of seven-and-a-half weeks \u2013 was seen at the University of Bristol. Its mental health support for undergraduates has come under close scrutiny as a result of the suicide or suspected suicide of 12 students there in the last three years. Other institutions with long average delays include Northumbria (42 days) and Edinburgh Napier, where students typically waited 30.7 days last year to access counselling and CBT. In contrast, those at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London were seen in just 1.2 days \u2013 the shortest wait among the 110 universities Lamb sought details from. Universities have been heavily criticised for the mental health provision they offer undergraduates, as the number of them seeking help has soared in recent years. Students\u2019 struggles can lead to them dropping out, doing poorly academically or killing themselves. An estimated 95 students in higher education took their own lives in the 12 months to July 2017 in England and Wales. Reported student mental ill-health has increased fivefold since 2010. Research has found that one in five (22%) students has been diagnosed with a mental ailment and that even more (34%) have struggled with a psychological issue with which they felt they needed professional help. In addition, 45% use drink or drugs to help them cope with problems, 43% worry often or all the time and 9% think about self-harming often or all the time. Responding to Lamb\u2019s findings, Tom Madders, campaigns director at the charity YoungMinds, said: \u201cIt is very worrying that there is considerable variation in the level of mental health support offered at universities around the country.

Many have increased the number of counsellors they employ or cut waiting times, for example. John de Pury, assistant director of policy at Universities UK, which represents the vast majority of universities, said it wanted institutions to do more to help students as soon as problems first emerge. \u201cMental health matters to universities but there is no simple answer to this challenge nor can they address it alone,\u201d he said. \u201cUniversities provide a range of mental health services \u2013 not just counselling \u2013 to support students.

After closing her New York brand, she wanted to start from scratch. \u201cI was terrified by the predictions for our planet and how I might have contributed to it,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s how I came to vintage.\u201d Her brand, Rentrayage, launching for AW19, joins the likes of Rave Review and One Vintage in creating new clothes out of existing fabric found after \u201cscouring every corner that we can\u201d. SC Worth a try? The Rugby World Cup is yet to kick off but fashion is already on board, with the return of vintage-style shirts: worn with Peaky Blinders caps at Kent &amp; Curwen; monochrome under a black dinner suit at Todd Snyder; upside down, oversized and spliced into skirts at Burberry; collegiate at Wales Bonner; and a bit futuristic at Xander Zhou. It\u2019s time to dive into the scrum. LH A trend with legs Wrinkled knees, school uniform-grey, with crusts of nail polish to curb ladders: tights come loaded with unglamorous associations. But all that\u2019s about to change. On the catwalk this season, tights gave a clash of colour at Ashley Williams (deep orange paired with a yellow dress) and Burberry (bright pink with a muted dress). Elsewhere, they blended into the background at Richard Quinn and added texture and pattern at Asai. For the brand\u2019s designer A Sai Ta, tights can \u201camplify a look, or add versatility to a favourite dress\u201d. Think of them not as a necessity but as a way to experiment with your winter wardrobe. The biggest surprise of the latest trend? That high-denier black tights \u2013 so long a high-fashion no-no \u2013 have become a hit. See the Balenciaga, Balmain and Alexa Chung catwalks for reference \u2013 proof that tights can be used to make an outfit bang and are just as good at providing that all-important bassline to your look. EVB Pin it Brooches will add a jolt of flavour to any autumn outfit. They are also a great hack to conceal accidental spills, as anyone who has watched Phoebe on Friends knows. EVB Over the rainbow The fantastical world of Tim Walker will come to life at the V&amp;A in London this month, in the largest ever celebration of the fashion photographer\u2019s 25-year career. From an impressive back catalogue including Julianne Moore modelling Emanuel Ungaro and one of the most famous and intimate portraits of the late Alexander McQueen to 150 new works he created specially after exploring the museum\u2019s archive, Tim Walker: Wonderful Things is \u201ca joy from start to finish\u201d, says curator Susanna Brown. \u201cHis pictures are never about the clothes alone. They\u2019re about storytelling, dreams and make-believe.\u201d SC",

      "bodyText": "The remains of a high-quality Romano-British butcher\u2019s business and centre for crafts have been unearthed by archaeologists in Devon. Experts believe the fourth-century abattoir was set up to prepare the best cuts of beef that were transported to customers miles away along a Roman road found at the site. They suggest the butchers at Ipplepen, near Newton Abbot in south Devon, worked alongside a string of talented craftspeople specialising in deer antler, leather and textiles. Previous digs at Ipplepen have unearthed Roman coins, a stretch of Roman road and the remnants of vessels from France and the Mediterranean once full of wine, olive oil and garum \u2013 fish sauce. The site is significant because it has undermined the notion that ancient Rome\u2019s influence had not stretched further south-west in the British Isles than Exeter, 20 miles to the north of Ipplepen. During the latest dig, the focus has been on a spot away from what is thought to be the centre of the Ipplepen settlement. They did not find scraps of pottery that suggest homes but a ditch full of 1,700-year-old cattle bones. The remains are mostly just the heads and feet of cattle \u2013 analysis suggests that cattle were raised locally and butchered when they were at the prime age for producing high-quality beef. Prof Stephen Rippon, from the University of Exeter, who is leading the archaeological work, said that if the cattle had been raised and slaughtered by peasant farmers nothing would have been left of them. \u201cThey would have boiled down the bits that have been thrown away and made something like brawn out of them,\u201d he said. The age of the animals is another big clue. \u201cThe normal practice would have been to keep the cattle into old age, pulling ploughs and so on. Our cattle were one and a half to two years old \u2013 which fits in with the idea of this being professional beef production. \u201cWe think they were preparing good meat joints and perhaps storing them in barrels of salted water and taking them somewhere else.

And on this score, Cameron and his former colleagues have huge questions to answer, if only someone would ask them.

The bookmaker, which employs more than 7,000 people, admitted it had failed to make automatic payments to staff owed extra holiday pay because they had worked overtime. Instead it calculated holiday pay based on their contracted hours, in many cases far fewer than those they actually worked, potentially leaving staff hundreds of pounds out of pocket. Law firm Leigh Day is seeking to speak to staff who work at the company\u2019s 1,650 betting shops to determine whether they could have a legal claim against the company. The Guardian has seen correspondence between Betfred and Peter Dowd MP, the Labour MP for Bootle, in which Betfred acknowledged the problem and promised to notify staff, allowing them to claim their money. Betfred did not respond directly to questions on whether it has notified its staff. But a whistleblower, who alerted the Guardian to the problem, claimed Betfred had not sent out a company-wide memo since making the promise in mid-August and was instead waiting for employees, many of whom were unaware they were owed money, to make a claim. It is unclear how many of Betfred\u2019s staff, many of whom earn little more than the minimum wage, have been affected.

And it played with form with the eagerness of Tony tucking into some \u2018gabagool\u2019, staging Godot-like one-acters in the Pine Barrens and devoting entire episodes to the fever-dream musings of a comatose Tony.</p> <p>The Sopranos hastened TV\u2019s transformation into a medium where intelligence, experimentation and depth were treasured. Critics still put it at the top of best of lists like this one. Fevered conversations are still had online about the show\u2019s symbolic use of eggs, ducks and teeth, and of course that rug-pull of an ending. For anyone currently making TV, the show stands as something to aspire to, perhaps even better. That is easier said than done, of course. Plenty of programmes have come at the boss, but none has managed to carry out a successful hit. <strong>GM</strong></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 17 September 2019 to clarify that Lynn Novick co-created The Vietnam War with Ken Burns. </p>",

(2002-) Crocodile penis eating in the outback with Ant and Dec didn\u2019t exactly sound appealing, but this long-running reality series pushed the genre to entertaining new heights. 99 Life on Mars (2006-07) The Beeb\u2019s Bowie-referencing, time-travelling cop show invigorated the genre \u2013 and introduced one of the great British TV characters in the form of the swaggering, sweary Gene Hunt. 98 The Mighty Boosh (2004-07) Some loathed its quirky outlook, but there was no disputing the imagination of Noel Fielding and Julian Barratt\u2019s sticky-back-plastic comedy, full of memorable grotesques and endlessly quotable skits. 97 The Shadow Line (2011) Containing next-to-no hand-holding, Hugo Blick\u2019s sprawling drama plunged you into a world of crime and corruption as Chiwetel Ejiofor and Christopher Eccleston investigated the same murder from different sides of the detective/criminal divide. 96 Broad City (2014-19) Abbi and Ilana\u2019s adventures around New York City gave us five years of japes and scrapes, phone wigs and Bingo Bronson \u2013 plus the most moving depiction of the mutual neediness of friendship in TV history. Yass kweens! 95 The Trip (2010-) Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon somehow convinced first the BBC, then Sky, to let them dine in Europe\u2019s best restaurants while doing Michael Caine impressions. Even more amazingly, that vanity project became one of the funniest shows of this decade. 94 Skins (2007-13) Euphoria may be the teen show of the moment, but a decade before it this drama was pushing boundaries for adolescent behaviour on TV. Yet crucially \u2013 and unlike so many shows of its ilk \u2013 it never talked down to the audience it depicted. 93 RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race (2009-) The perfect show for queens with charisma, uniqueness, nerve and talent, RuPaul has been serving realness and throwing shade since 2009. 92 Garth Marenghi\u2019s Darkplace (2004) \u201cBlood? Blood. Blood! And bits of sick.\u201d The dictionary definition of cult viewing, Matthew Holness\u2019s spoof of shonky British horror barely made a dent when it aired, but has since become regarded as a modern classic. 91 Silicon Valley (2014-) Mike Judge\u2019s genius comedy about the travails of a motley gang of developers mercilessly sends up the world of tech bros \u2026 and yet everyone from Mark Zuckerberg to Google founder Sergey Brin are superfans. 90 24 (2001-10) The longest day of Jack Bauer\u2019s life became the most gripping TV drama of the 00s, as the hard-nosed CTU agent tried to stop terrorists, turncoat colleagues and even the odd treacherous president in thrilling real-time. 89 The L Word (2004-09) The shamelessly soapy and explicit LGBT drama about Bette, Shane and their impossibly glam leather-vest-clad gang in Los Angeles. 88 Justified (2010-15) The first and finest of a wave of modern small-screen westerns, this elegant Elmore Leonard adaptation was stocked full of memorable characters and dizzying dialogue. 87 The Leftovers (2014-17) Daring and dumbfounding, Damon Lindelof\u2019s drama about survivors of a rapture-like event threw everything into its three acclaimed seasons, from homicidal cults to a mass orgy on a boat. 86 Fresh Meat (2011-16) About as accurate a depiction of the debauchery, alienation and awkwardness of student life as it\u2019s possible to imagine, this winning comedy-drama introduced us to one of the century\u2019s true style icons in the form of the sensational Vod. 85 Gogglebox (2013-) Why would anyone watch someone else watching telly? The answer soon became clear with this brilliantly executed reality show, which introduced viewers to a host of hilarious, not to mention surprisingly TV-literate, families. 84 Looking (2014-16) Andrew Haigh\u2019s cruise through the San Francisco gay scene skipped the LGBT lesson-learning in favour of a thrillingly human relationship drama. 83 Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1997-2003) A ropey B-movie was reimagined as a brilliant subversion of fantasy tropes in Joss Whedon\u2019s beloved series, which introduced the world to a feminist pop icon in Sarah Michelle Gellar\u2019s teen slayer. 82 Strictly Come Dancing (2004-) The celebrity ballroom dance competition that quickstepped on to our screens in 2004 and has made our lives more fab-u-lous by the year. Glitterati, assemble! 81 Gavin and Stacey (2007-10) The well lush Anglo-Welsh sitcom about Gav\u2019n\u2019Stace, Nessa and Smithy that became a BBC phenomenon then propelled James Corden to global stardom. Catch up with them again in a special this Christmas. Bang tidy. 80 Veep (2012-19) Julia Louis-Dreyfus served as perfectly shambolic fictional foil to the real-life disaster that is US politics, in a Stateside companion piece to The Thick of It. 79 Halt and Catch Fire (2014-17) The thrilling 80s computer-whiz drama that landed in the Mad Men slot on AMC, but never got the fanbase it deserved. 78 Freaks and Geeks (1999-2000) Judd Apatow\u2019s impeccable cult show about the Bionic Woman-loving nerds and burnouts, disco dancers and Dungeon Masters of McKinley High in 1980 that was canned after just one short season. 77 The Shield (2002-08) A key part, alongside the Sopranos, The Wire and Deadwood, of the golden age of antihero drama, this thriller about likable \u2013 and utterly corrupt \u2013 cops broke new ground for bold, risk-taking television. 76 A Very English Scandal (2018) Hugh Grant was on rollicking form as the Liberal party leader Jeremy Thorpe on trial for conspiring to murder his young lover, Norman Scott (Ben Whishaw). As Thorpe would say, \u201ca very heaven\u201d. 75 It\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphia (2005-) Inarguably the most gleefully offensive show on this list, the sitcom about the despicable owners of a Philly dive bar is also one of the most consistent: each of its 13 seasons features a truckload of laugh-out-loud moments. 74 The Inbetweeners (2008-10) The show that launched a thousand cries of \u201cooh friends\u201d remains one of the most enjoyable sitcoms of the past decade, with its relatable tale of four suburban normies negotiating sixth form. 73 Spiral (2005-) Frequently compared to The Wire, this French crime saga offered a forensic view of France\u2019s justice system, albeit with enough twists and turns to keep fans totally hooked. 72 Planet Earth (2006 and 2016) Groundbreaking doesn\u2019t even begin to describe this globe-straddling documentary epic, which for the first time showed the world\u2019s wildlife in gleaming HD. A decade later, with death-defying iguanas, its sequel wowed us all over again. 71 Lost (2004-10) From the murderous black smoke to the button that had to be pushed every 108 minutes to save the world, this was the bonkers plane-crash drama that got us all going in the 00s. 70 Shameless (2004-13) All hail Frank Gallagher and his magnificent Mancunian ne\u2019er-do-wells! Paul Abbott\u2019s drama might have dragged on a little too long but at its best it provided a refreshing burst of authentically working-class TV comedy-drama. 69 The Good Place (2016-) Another heavenly sitcom from Mike Schur (The US Office, Parks and Recreation), this series about a miscreant mistakenly sent to a paradisiacal afterlife managed to combine philosophical questions, jaw-dropping twists and a deluge of gags. 68 Band of Brothers (2001) Steven Spielberg\u2019s supersized second world war epic expanded the horizons \u2013 and budgets \u2013 of prestige TV. 67 Borgen (2010-13) Proof that Scandinavian drama doesn\u2019t have to be about glowering detectives, this Danish political saga followed glowering politicians instead. Still, it was never less than engrossing and boasted a fascinating figure in glass ceiling-battering prime minister Birgitte Nyborg. 66 Inside No 9 (2014-) Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton\u2019s anthology series continues to amaze, each episode delivering a dizzyingly inventive horror-comedy one-off. Everyone has their favourite, but the Sheridan Smith-starring 12 Days of Christine might just be the show\u2019s masterpiece. 65 Flight of the Conchords (2007-09) A true TV original, Bret McKenzie and Jemaine Clement\u2019s musical comedy about a hopeless New Zealand band floundering in NYC combined stoner comedy and inescapably earwormy songs to utterly charming effect. 64 Six Feet Under (2001-05) Alan Ball\u2019s profound drama about the Fisher family and their funeral home was gloriously moving and unnerving, and made us tackle our own mortality head-on. 63 Show Me a Hero (2015) David Simon was on typically masterful form in this epic about the housing crisis in 80s Yonkers that was tragically underwatched. 62 Succession (2018-) The newest show on our list, Jesse Armstrong\u2019s comedy-drama about a dysfunctional media dynasty already feels like a modern classic, full of magnificently malignant characters and devastating one-liners. 61 State of Play (2003) Far better than the glossy film adaptation that followed it, Paul Abbott\u2019s taut, twisty corruption drama felt like the perfect political thriller for the New Labour age. And no, we didn\u2019t just like it because the heroes were journos! 60 Sherlock (2010-) The Baker Street reboot that made us all step inside Benedict Cumberbatch\u2019s mind palace. At its best, few shows could match it in terms of pure event television. 59 Wolf Hall (2015) Mark Rylance cemented his status as one of the greatest living actors with this performance as Thomas Cromwell in a sumptuous prestige TV take on Hilary Mantel\u2019s historical doorstop. 58 Orange Is the New Black (2013-19) Jenji Kohan revolutionised television for ever with her gripping women\u2019s prison drama about Piper, Poussey, Taystee and the Litchfield Penitentiary inmates. 57 Sex and the City (1998-2004) \u201cI\u2019m dating a guy with the funkiest tasting spunk.\u201d Faced so recently with the movie SATC2: Calamity in Abu Dhabi, it can be easy to forget just how hilarious and refreshingly candid Samantha, Carrie, Miranda and Charlotte were when they first graced our screens. 56 The Jinx (2015) The best of the glut of prestige true-crime programmes that have emerged in recent years, this forensic docuseries about Robert Durst, the estate heir accused of murder, featured one of the most jaw-dropping final moments of TV ever. 55 Utopia (2014) Six years on, we\u2019re still wincing at the thought of that eyeball scene, but Dennis Kelly\u2019s conspiracy thriller about an apocalypse-predicting graphic novel was more than just ultraviolence: gorgeously shot and endlessly beguiling, it remains like nothing else on TV. 54 Parks and Recreation (2009-15) Twenty minutes a week of pure optimism, this Amy Poehler-starring sitcom about a fizzingly enthusiastic civil servant somehow did the miraculous: it made local government seem fun. 53 Black Books (2000-04) No contest in the award for the most misanthropic character of the century: Dylan Moran wins hands down for his bile-flecked bookshop owner Bernard Black in this delightfully silly sitcom. 52 The Good Fight (2017-) Like its predecessor The Good Wife but dialled up to 11, this is the most daring legal drama of them all \u2013 with gobsmacking plots about #MeToo monsters, Donald\u2019s pee-pee tape and Melania\u2019s bid to get a stealthy divorce. 51 Patrick Melrose (2018) An extraordinary self-flagellating performance by Benedict Cumberbatch as a drug-dependent aristocrat anchored this superb adaptation of Edward St Aubyn\u2019s semi-autobiographical novels. Surely the finest portrayal of addiction ever seen on TV. 50 Downton Abbey (2010-15) This was TV drama as comfort blanket: at a time of austerity, Julian Fellowes\u2019s country house epic offered elegantly realised solace in the homilies of the past. If the plotting felt formulaic, the performances were entirely convincing \u2013 from Maggie Smith\u2019s dowager countess Violet Crawley to Jim Carter\u2019s impossibly decorous butler Carson, everyone knew their place. PH Read the review. 49 Insecure (2016-) Issa Rae started her acting career with a web series called The Misadventures of Awkward Black Girl. While popular, Rae was able to have her seat at the table for real with Insecure. A show about black female friendship and relationships that isn\u2019t filtered through a white gaze and doesn\u2019t play into tired stereotypes, this HBO series refuses to compromise on authenticity, and, despite changing viewing habits, has proved one of the biggest web-to-screen hits to date. HJD Read the review. 48 Better Call Saul (2015-) The Breaking Bad prequel, centred on a ducking, diving lawyer called Jimmy McGill who will one day become Saul Goodman, is an entirely different drama \u2013 albeit exploring the same theme of what actions people are willing to take when their American dreams refuse to come true. A supremely measured character piece that has steadily improved as its central tragedy has materialised. JS Read the review. 47 Nathan Barley (2005) In 2005, Charlie Brooker and Chris Morris\u2019s twatcom seemed oddly dated \u2013 a satire of a cultural moment that had already passed. But time has rendered it deeply prescient: Barley occupied a perfectly sealed echo chamber of self-conscious idiocy, and he self-branded furiously, long before social media came for our souls. Before there were hipsters, Nathan and his fellow self-facilitating media nodes were already keeping it Mencap. PH Read the review. 46 Doctor Who (2005-) The revitalised Doctor Who occupies its rightful position in the TV firmament: rarely the best show in any week or year but always there, always changing, always offering fodder for analysis, arguments and lists. Jodie Whittaker\u2019s arrival as the first female Tardis-jockey maintained the show\u2019s record of refreshing itself just when its relevance threatens to wane \u2013 and with so much goodwill behind it, its standout episodes are still a celebratory shared experience. JS Read the review. 45 The Bridge (2011-18) None more noir but containing flashes of unexpected humour, this was one of the more impressive of the bleak dramas that flooded out of Scandinavia. The bridge of the title was the \u00d8resund, which connected Sweden and Denmark and led to multinational cooperation on a murder enquiry. Step forward ill-matched cops Martin Rohde and more interestingly Saga Nor\u00e9n, a brilliant but bizarre investigator unlike any maverick TV detective ever seen. PH Read the review. 44 The Crown (2016-) Filigree telly, with every painstakingly staged scene a plush indulgence \u2013 but Netflix\u2019s more-or-less true story of the British royal family has enough grit to make it more than just a luxury. Claire Foy\u2019s steely Elizabeth II introduced a fine study of people unsure how to live lives made extraordinary by huge privilege and indistinct power. JS Read the review. 43 The Americans (2013-18) Terminally overlooked in favour of flashier, flimsier fare, Joe Weisberg\u2019s tale of suburban subterfuge rewarded the few who did tune in with six seasons of gorgeous, slow-burning drama. Real-life husband and wife Matthew Rhys and Keri Russell convinced as a pair of Russian spies playing house in picket-fence 80s America, struggling with notions of loyalty, fidelity and family. The show\u2019s finale, which shifts between toe-curling tension and devastating poignancy, should be regarded as one for the ages. GM Read more here. 42 South Park (1997-) A starburst of fantastically inventive offence, Trey Parker and Matt Stone\u2019s crude animation combined grotesque hilarity with a deceptively serious purpose. South Park was both a gleeful dismantling of the American dream and a laser-guided exploration of the tender spots where freedom of speech and liberal sensitivities collide. As such, it has proved surprisingly prescient; many of America\u2019s current cultural fault lines first became apparent here. PH Read the review. 41 Friday Night Lights (2006-11) A tender, truthful look at the beating heart of small-town America, shone through the prism of one of its most engrained institutions: high school football. It had us all rooting for the Dillon Panthers, for Coach Taylor and Tami Taylor, quarterback Matt Saracen, cocky running back Smash Williams, badboy fullback Tim Riggins, endlessly lovable nerd Landry Clarke and Tyra Collette, the town\u2019s only anti-football fanatic. We followed them for every triumph and every touchdown, all the while screaming at our screens: \u201cClear eyes, full hearts, can\u2019t lose.\u201d KA 40 The Power of Nightmares (2004) Arriving in 2004, when US president George W Bush was becoming almost as much of a concern as Al-Qaida leader Osama Bin Laden, Adam Curtis\u2019s startling documentary series explored the shockingly congruent aims of fundamentalist Islam and American neo-conservatism. Equally striking was Curtis\u2019s trademark style, all logical provocations and uncanny juxtapositions; it\u2019s historical documentary as polemical art installation. PH Read more here. 39 The Good Wife (2009-16) The audacious legal drama took on a ripped-from-the-headlines case every week, tackling everything from fake news to election tampering, police racism and the terrors of surveillance culture. It responded so staggeringly fast to events that it sometimes felt too real. But it was also a rare drama that focused on women \u2013 rounded, complex, great, flawed, wonderful women \u2013 from the eponymous Alicia Florrick, who moved so far beyond the pained good wife of the opening episode, standing by her man through a humiliating sex scandal, to Diane Lockhart, the barnstorming firebrand in fabulous jewellery (one of the most glorious characters of the century). An exciting, exhilarating slap in the face to the very end. KA Read the review. 38 Detectorists (2014-17) What initially appeared to be a charming muse on the lives of two eccentric metal-detecting hobbyists soon revealed itself to be something more profound. Mackenzie Crook\u2019s labour of love was very funny, but it became ever more moving and thought-provoking. It was underpinned by a deep but open-minded and inclusive respect for our collective past, and animated by one of the most sweetly convincing friendships in television history. PH Read the review. 37 Brass Eye: Paedogeddon (2001) Even viewers familiar with Chris Morris\u2019s original 1997 current affairs satire raised a few startled eyebrows at Brass Eye\u2019s one-off return in 2001. Morris plunged into what, at the time, was one of the most emotive issues in British life \u2013 press coverage of paedophiles \u2013 and steamrollered every taboo he could get his teeth into inside half an hour. Newspapers howled, commentators pontificated, politicians blustered \u2013 and perhaps that was the point. PH Read more here. 36 The Great British Bake Off (2010-) With reality TV shifting from catty to comforting in recent times, both the BBC and Channel 4 have enjoyed the sweet smell of success with Bake Off. Mel and Sue\u2019s exodus was a blow to its softly-softly charm and Prue Leith is a more straight-talking judge than Mary Berry. But 10 series in, the amateur baking contest is still an autumn staple. As with most long-running reality shows, there\u2019s still a sense of familiarity despite some changes; this year\u2019s series features its youngest ever set of contestants. HJD Read the review. 35 This is England (2010-15) The characters introduced in Shane Meadows\u2019s 2007 film of the same name have acquired a vibrant small-screen life of their own. No wonder: they\u2019re incredibly resonant \u2013 they depict the kinds of British lives that are rarely explored at all, let alone with such tenderness and wisdom. We\u2019ve taken This is England\u2019s characters to our hearts but the series also functions as a parallel history of our country, warts and all. PH Read the review. 34 Catastrophe (2015-19) Rob Delaney and Sharon Horgan made their comedy great by never playing safe. At first it was a filthy gutbuster about a careless sexfest; then it frankly faced the grim reality of parenthood without losing its dirty grin. Finally, killing their darling just before it could flag, the pair delivered one of the best TV endings ever. A hardcore sitcom classic. JS Read the review. 33 Big Brother (2000-2018) The recent 10th anniversary of Jade Goody\u2019s death sparked much conversation around the original lock-em-up-and-throw-away-the-key-for-a-bit reality show. Big Brother was in many ways one of the most heinous shows ever broadcast, from \u201cNasty Nick\u201d Bateman fleeing the country to escape the tabloids to Kinga\u2019s wine bottle and Shilpa-gate. But it was also a show that would change TV \u2013 and our concept of celebrity \u2013 for ever. HJD Read more here. 32 The Office (US) (2005-13) Cross-continent reboots are notoriously rubbish. But when they evolve beyond by-the-numbers remakes and find an identity of their own, they can become excellent. A case in point: The Office US (originally subtitled \u201cAn American Workplace\u201d) found its feet once it stopped trying to be Gervais Part Two and instead established its own perpetually bored protagonists, led by Michael Scott, Steve Carell\u2019s self-proclaimed \u201cworld\u2019s best boss\u201d. HJD Read the review. 31 Blue Planet (2001/2017) It would be easy to take David Attenborough\u2019s startling odysseys into the natural world for granted. But technological developments have only increased their wonder, while the exponential destruction of the environment has lent them a polemical edge. Attenborough\u2019s two Blue Planet series have presented more mindblowing, naturally occurring psychedelia \u2013 long, strange trips into beautiful but inhospitable realms previously unexplored (and all-too-often degraded) by humanity. PH Read the review. 30 Killing Eve (2018-) Few shows in TV history have scythed on to the screen with as much elan as Phoebe Waller-Bridge\u2019s spy v spy thriller, which arrived with dialogue as impossibly sharp and cool as the European locations and Jodie Comer\u2019s couture costumes. The death dance between Comer\u2019s psychopath and Sandra Oh\u2019s coiled-spring MI5 nerd means each episode has a handful of outlandish payoffs that other dramas spend whole seasons working towards. JS Read the review. 29 Spaced (1999-2001) It might have ended back in 2001 but Simon Pegg, Edgar Wright and Jessica Hynes\u2019s flatshare sitcom can stake a legitimate claim as the most influential comedy of this millennium: its quick cuts, genre parodies and geek humour have been adopted by everything from Community to Preacher. Yet for all the Star Wars homages, Spaced was, at its heart, a terrific character comedy, boasting a cracking cast that included Mark Heap\u2019s tortured artist Brian and Julia Deakin\u2019s formidable, chianti-powered landlady Marsha. GM Read the review. 28 The Killing (2007-12) Tracking a single murder case across 20 hours of subtitled drama might have seemed a hard sell. But this Danish procedural had a secret weapon in detective Sarah Lund (Sofie Gr\u00e5b\u00f8l). Lund\u2019s knitwear became an unlikely totem of the show, but the real appeal was Gr\u00e5b\u00f8l\u2019s remarkable performance. Over three gripping seasons, Lund told us everything and nothing about herself, becoming one of the great TV enigmas. PH Read the review. 27 Transparent (2014-19) Amazon has struggled to get its TV originals right, but it made a perfect start with this mercurial, millennial dramedy. The plaudits for breaking new ground by centring on a transgender character were deserved, and no TV show before or since has handled diversity of gender and sexuality so assuredly. On top of all that is a seriously funny look at people failing to turn fluid modern adulthood into happiness. JS Read the review. 26 Red Riding Trilogy (2009) Set in the Ripper-plagued Yorkshire of the 1970s, David Peace\u2019s original novels are strewn with feverish internal monologues. Adapting them for television was always likely to prove tricky. However, this trilogy rose to the challenge superbly, drawing on the diverse but complementary visions of three different directors (Julian Jarrold, James Marsh and Anand Tucker) and a host of superb performances to bring the era unnervingly to life. PH Read the review. 25 The Handmaid\u2019s Tale (2017-) Arriving on our screens with almost eerie timeliness three months into the Trump presidency, this adaptation of Margaret Atwood\u2019s dystopian novel serves as a helpful reminder that, if we\u2019re not careful, things could get even more like Gilead. The show\u2019s patriarchal hellscape, where the chaste culture of kept women sits uneasily next to the machine guns and combat gear of the men doing the keeping, is terrifyingly well-realised, while Elisabeth Moss delivers a remarkable performance as Offred, the Handmaid who dreams of blowing it up. GM Read the review. 24 The Daily Show with Jon Stewart (1999-2015) Wise-ass but frequently just plain wise, Jon Stewart was a broadcasting natural with such range that he was equally convincing whether presenting a show in the aftermath of 9/11 or excoriating Chicago\u2019s fondness for deep-pan pizza. For more than a decade, he was a unique and persuasive liberal voice in American affairs; we shudder to imagine what he would have made of the current US political situation. PH Read more here. 23 Black Mirror (2011-) Ambition is probably Charlie Brooker\u2019s best quality as a writer: he had the balls to start his sci-fi anthology with an episode about the prime minister being forced to violate a pig, then took the chance to take Black Mirror global by shifting from Channel 4 to Netflix. Now every new helping of his dystopia is event telly, drawing in A-list talent and, with one-offs such as the interactive Bandersnatch, continuing to push at the medium\u2019s limits. JS Read the review. 22 Twin Peaks: The Return (2017) No one knew what to expect from the reappearance, after nearly 30 years, of David Lynch\u2019s mystery drama. From its first frame to its soul-rending primal scream of a conclusion, The Return proved thrillingly baffling, full of indelible images (nuclear explosions, demonic cockroaches, David Bowie as a giant kettle) and dizzying dream logic. At the centre of the chaos was Kyle MacLachlan, radiating previously untapped levels of magnificence as both the valiant Agent Cooper and his breathtakingly evil doppelganger. GM Read the review. 21 Arrested Development (2003-19) The underwhelming Netflix reboot of Mitch Hurwitz\u2019s comedy, about a dysfunctional and in retrospect vaguely Trumpian dynasty, shouldn\u2019t detract too much from the legacy of its brilliant first three seasons, which raised the bar for intricate, intelligent sitcommery. Such was the density of references, callbacks and gags that Arrested Development proved to be that rare thing \u2013 a show that became funnier on repeated viewings. GM Read more here. 20 OJ: Made in America (2016) It was the story of a US footballer, accused of murder and subsequently acquitted. But it was so much more besides. Over seven compelling hours, Ezra Edelman pulled back from his immediate subject by homing in on its minutiae. Exploring the context of OJ Simpson\u2019s rise and fall, Edelman constructed a startling treatise on race, gender, celebrity and capitalism itself. The result was an alternative history of modern America. PH Read the review. 19 The Vietnam War (2017) More like a definitive historical document than a TV series. While Vietnam remains a scab at which America is compelled to pick, this panorama by Ken Burns and Lynn Novick feels like the last word. Beginning decades before the war and following its echoes up to the present day, the series plunged into the quagmire, illuminating the horror for all to see but concluded with threads of humanity reclaimed from the carnage. PH Read the review. 18 Girls (2012-17) For all its problems (and there were many, from a lack of diversity to Lena Dunham\u2019s impressive propensity for foot-in-mouth moments), Girls changed the half-hour sitcom for the better. Originally billed as an updated Sex and the City, it grew into something more troubled and more troubling, bringing the best of mumblecore to the small screen via a spaghetti-slurping, often half-naked antihero (Dunham\u2019s Hannah Horvath), who proved as relatable as she was entirely out of control.

But it was more singular and ornery than any of its contemporaries. Milch created a universe that was simultaneously recognisable and utterly alien \u2013 then peopled it with extraordinary characters such as Ian McShane\u2019s Al Swearengen. Sacred, profane and well deserving of its glorious feature-length resolution this year.

Jill responded to her husband\u2019s cancer diagnosis by attempting to break up the marriage next door, then staging an exceptionally excruciating mock funeral for her spouse (who had recovered but been forcibly committed to a hospice) and trying to seduce a 12-year-old. An absolute monster and an absolute masterpiece of provocation and bad taste. PH Read the review. 15 The West Wing (1999-2006) Aaron Sorkin\u2019s sparky, witty and (some would say excessively) erudite political drama achieved the impossible: it made niche US legislation, from lame-duck sessions to filibusters, utterly compelling. Plus it gave us the most popular president in US history, Josiah \u201cJed\u201d Bartlet. Fans must watch it now and weep into their fake newspaper at the Trumpian state of things. There were certain missteps (the patronising 9/11 episode, we\u2019re looking at you), but this was TV that showed America it is possible to hope for better, even the best, from the leader of the free world.

But you could usually just about sympathise with his wrongness and understand his arrival in a variety of hideous scrapes. In a sitcom that was both deeply meta (David was playing a constructed but also deconstructed version of himself) and proudly traditional (it overflowed with sight-gags and classic setups), the comedy of excruciation reached its peak. PH Read the review. 13 Line of Duty (2012-) Rarely has a drama demanding such commitment from viewers captured the popular imagination to this extent. It\u2019s testimony to the excellence of Jed Mercurio\u2019s writing but mainly to masterful central performances from Martin Compston, Vicky McClure and Adrian Dunbar who, as anti-corruption unit AC12, represent a still point around which all manner of police malfeasance swirls. Line of Duty\u2019s interrogation scenes have set a new standard in small-screen tension and release. PH Read more here. 12 30 Rock (2006-13) Still badly underrated, Tina Fey\u2019s sitcom rendering of her experiences inside the US TV machine was a fiery take on the tension between creative types and money men, the latter embodied by an all-timer performance from Alec Baldwin as an insane network exec. But it was as cynical about comedians as it was suits, the result being a joke machine with few limits on its satire or its silliness. JS Read more here. 11 Happy Valley (2014-) A corrective to the cliche-ridden and frequently blokey police procedurals that dominated the first two decades of this century, Sally Wainwright\u2019s slice of Yorkshire noir pulsated with poignant realness. In Sarah Lancashire\u2019s stoic sergeant Catherine Cawood, it found a true heroine for our times, resourceful, funny and empathetic. A good thing too, because the world Wainwright constructed around her \u2013 full of death, addiction and desperate poverty \u2013 was almost overwhelmingly, authentically bleak. GM Read the review. 10 Atlanta (2016-) Donald Glover\u2019s foray into dramedy fizzes with pop-culture callbacks, political subtext and dark lols, following underachieving Earn, wannabe rapper cousin Paper Boi and their black millennial peers. Its best episodes are the ones where racial conflict meets all-out weirdness, among them Helen \u2013 in which Earn feels thoroughly adrift at a Germanic festival \u2013 and Teddy Perkins, the Shining-inspired, Get Out-style tale of Darius\u2019s (Lakeith Stanfield) trip to pick up a piano from a mysterious hermit. HJD Read more here. 9 Peep Show (2003-15) The king of 00s sitcoms: formally innovative, with its point-of-view filming and audible inner monologues, and unflinching in how it used that format to be disgustingly honest about diseased male minds. A textbook contrasting duo in careless Jez and cowardly Mark gave writers Jesse Armstrong and Sam Bain the platform for greatness, and the quality barely dipped across nine seasons. Peep Show was always, hilariously, an inch over the boundary of good taste. JS Read more here. 8 Fleabag (2016-19) When Phoebe Waller-Bridge\u2019s Fleabag arrived on stage in London some six years ago, critics had their doubts (one even commented \u201cI doubt if this material will spin off into a long-running radio or television series\u201d). How wrong they were: as well as returning to the stage for a sold-out run this year, Fleabag\u2019s two-series TV run saw Waller-Bridge infuse the nascent sadcom genre with classic British awkwardness, encompassing grief, family breakdown and, of course, Obama-themed masturbation. HJD Read more here. 7 Game of Thrones (2011-19) Despite the widespread calls by superfans to rewrite the entire last series, from Daenerys\u2019 descent into madness to Starbucksgate, Game of Thrones remains the biggest show of the century so far. Even Ed Sheeran sitting by a fire singing a ditty about hands of gold can\u2019t irreparably dent its reputation. And it did come up with the goods throughout its eight-year reign: from the thrills and blood spills to the men baked in pies and the best battles ever seen on the small screen, right through to Cleganebowl. Only The Winds of Winter book will spare us all from Westeros withdrawal. KA Read more here. 6 The Office (UK) (2001-03) It didn\u2019t invent the mockumentary, but Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant\u2019s debut was so stylistically confident it defined swathes of the comedy that followed its 2001 premiere: two decades on, people are still making pale imitations. Its creators haven\u2019t topped it either but with time, their casting decisions look as extraordinary as their scripts. It\u2019s hard to fathom now that Martin Freeman, Mackenzie Crook and Gervais himself were all then relative unknowns. JS Read more here. 5 Breaking Bad (2008-13) The show that arguably killed off the antihero drama: nothing since has been able to top the depraved descent made by Walter White (a never-better Bryan Cranston), from milquetoast chemistry teacher to meth overlord, and few have dared to try. Yet as grimly engrossing as White\u2019s transformation was, what kept us returning to Vince Gilligan\u2019s low-key epic was Aaron Paul\u2019s performance as his reluctant partner in crime, Jesse Pinkman, whose frayed humanity shone through the moral murk like a beacon. GM Read more here. 4 The Thick of It (2005-12) The craven, idiotic likes of Peter Mannion and Nicola Murray would be paragons of probity and wisdom in today\u2019s parliamentary landscape. But at the time, Armando Iannucci\u2019s scabrous comedy felt like an indictment of everything wrong with the spin and cynicism of British politics. Luckily, it was also hilarious, mainly thanks to the inventive invective of Peter Capaldi\u2019s ferocious \u201cIago with a BlackBerry\u201d Malcolm Tucker. PH Read more here. 3 Mad Men (2007-15) The sex! The swagger! The suits! Matthew Weiner\u2019s Madison Avenue masterwork went down with all the smooth, smoky allure of one of Don Draper\u2019s copious Old-Fashioneds. But by spanning the entire 60s, showing the mammoth social shifts in an ad agency in minute detail \u2013 from the advent of the Pill and second-wave feminism to the rise of hippies and the dropping of LSD \u2013 it became more than just the tale of one mystery man and compulsive philanderer come good: it was a meditation on how modern America came to be made, one iconic advert at a time. KA 2 The Wire (2002-08) Along with The Sopranos, David Simon and Ed Burns\u2019s Baltimore crime saga showed that small-screen entertainment could be anything it aspired to be: polemical, panoramic, funny, tragic or all of those things at once. Beautifully written and performed, this was both TV as high art and TV wrenched from the soul. To this day, it\u2019s an exemplar of a certain brand of intelligent, ambitious and uncompromising television. PH Read more here. 1 The Sopranos (1999-2007) It is hard to fathom now, but when Tony Soprano first slumped into an armchair in his psychiatrist Dr Melfi\u2019s office, TV was still largely looked down upon. The slogan for the Sopranos\u2019 broadcaster \u2013 \u2018It\u2019s not TV, it\u2019s HBO\u2019 \u2013 felt telling in its dismissiveness, as if making a television programme was something to be ashamed about. The Sopranos changed all that. When it first aired, some were quick to dismiss it as just another mob drama. But David Chase took a cleaver to the conventions and cliches of the gangster epic. Its Family wasn\u2019t some pinstripe-clad crew swaggering down Brooklyn back alleys, but a tragicomic rabble reigning over the unprepossessing suburbs of New Jersey. It was a world populated by fragile and petty people, arguing over Tupperware like Paulie Walnuts or ordering a hit over rumours about their bedroom activities like Uncle Junior. And its protagonist was a hulking, ferocious don beset by panic attacks and cowed by his far more ferocious mother. And what a protagonist! Here was a man who would break off from his daughter\u2019s college open day to brutally murder an informant, and we were supposed to if not actively root for him, at least follow him into the abyss. Yet follow him we did, because of the qualities that moved him beyond the mobster stereotype. From the off, this was a show with bigger thoughts in mind: the downfall of the white working class, Jungian psychoanalysis, shifting sexual politics and the eternal question of whether an interior decorator could kill 16 Czechoslovakians. And it played with form with the eagerness of Tony tucking into some \u2018gabagool\u2019, staging Godot-like one-acters in the Pine Barrens and devoting entire episodes to the fever-dream musings of a comatose Tony. The Sopranos hastened TV\u2019s transformation into a medium where intelligence, experimentation and depth were treasured. Critics still put it at the top of best of lists like this one. Fevered conversations are still had online about the show\u2019s symbolic use of eggs, ducks and teeth, and of course that rug-pull of an ending. For anyone currently making TV, the show stands as something to aspire to, perhaps even better. That is easier said than done, of course. Plenty of programmes have come at the boss, but none has managed to carry out a successful hit.

It adds: \u201cWe also regard calls for the death of members of our armed forces as extremist.\u201d</p> <p>Khan said this is too broad and needs to be rewritten, as does the entire strategy. The lack of a legally robust definition of extremism was one of the reasons that an extremism bill touted in the run up to the 2015 general election, complete with civil orders to ban extremist groups, never transpired.</p> <p>But Khan said it was clear from the work done in the last year that extremism was prevalent, with nearly 50% of respondents to the call for evidence claiming to have witnessed extremism in some form. \u201cYou\u2019re seeing a diverse spectrum of different types of behaviour,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Another challenge facing counter-extremism, Khan said, is protecting the rights to freedom of expression and assembly. \u201cSome of the concerns people raised with us we would actually consider to be freedom of expression issues. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not interested in curtailing freedom of expression, what I want to do is to protect freedom of expression and also the rights of other peoples that extremists seek to restrict and undermine.\u201d</p> <p>The report will underline the need for a \u201cwhole society\u201d response to tackling extremism.</p> <p>Khan said: \u201cI feel very strongly that government can\u2019t fix everything. So when we\u2019re talking about challenging extremist narratives, extremist ideologies, for me I think civil society has a huge rule to play in this.\u201d</p> <p>There have been recent calls for further legal powers to tackle extremism. The Tony Blair Institute for Global Change proposed new legislation similar to proscription powers for terrorist groups \u2013 the power to ban membership and support for specific organisations.</p> <p>But Khan said the commission had not heard a \u201cstrong case for more powers\u201d.</p> <p>She added: \u201cThere\u2019s a question of whether existing powers are being used appropriately.

In its 2015 counter-extremism strategy, the government defined extremism as \u201cthe vocal or active opposition to our fundamental values, including democracy, the rule of law, individual liberty and the mutual respect and tolerance of different faiths and beliefs\u201d. It adds: \u201cWe also regard calls for the death of members of our armed forces as extremist.\u201d Khan said this is too broad and needs to be rewritten, as does the entire strategy. The lack of a legally robust definition of extremism was one of the reasons that an extremism bill touted in the run up to the 2015 general election, complete with civil orders to ban extremist groups, never transpired. But Khan said it was clear from the work done in the last year that extremism was prevalent, with nearly 50% of respondents to the call for evidence claiming to have witnessed extremism in some form. \u201cYou\u2019re seeing a diverse spectrum of different types of behaviour,\u201d she said. Another challenge facing counter-extremism, Khan said, is protecting the rights to freedom of expression and assembly. \u201cSome of the concerns people raised with us we would actually consider to be freedom of expression issues. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in curtailing freedom of expression, what I want to do is to protect freedom of expression and also the rights of other peoples that extremists seek to restrict and undermine.\u201d The report will underline the need for a \u201cwhole society\u201d response to tackling extremism. Khan said: \u201cI feel very strongly that government can\u2019t fix everything. So when we\u2019re talking about challenging extremist narratives, extremist ideologies, for me I think civil society has a huge rule to play in this.\u201d There have been recent calls for further legal powers to tackle extremism. The Tony Blair Institute for Global Change proposed new legislation similar to proscription powers for terrorist groups \u2013 the power to ban membership and support for specific organisations. But Khan said the commission had not heard a \u201cstrong case for more powers\u201d. She added: \u201cThere\u2019s a question of whether existing powers are being used appropriately. I don\u2019t think they are. What we\u2019re going to do as part of our future work programme is to review all existing powers.\u201d The most recent official statistics on hate crime \u2013 one of the few quantifiable indicators of levels of extremism \u2013 show that in 2017-18, there were 94,098 hate crime offences recorded by police in England and Wales, an increase of 17% compared with the previous year. Asked if the police need to do more, Khan said: \u201cWhat I want to work with the police more on is to make sure we\u2019re using existing powers in the appropriate way when we see examples of extremism.\u201d Khan\u2019s appointment to the role was met with criticism. She is viewed by some as an establishment figure who has backed divisive policies including the anti-radicalisation Prevent programme, which many have argued unfairly targets Muslim communities. The commission itself continues to be attract criticism. Khan said she had become used to backlash and had grown a \u201cthick skin\u201d. \u201cAt the end of the day, a lot of these counter-extremists who are challenging far-right groups or Islamist groups or others are doing really vital work and should be supported for that work.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The education secretary, Gavin Williamson, has backed a review into university admissions, including a fresh look at whether school leavers should only apply for places after receiving their A-level results. Williamson said recent developments, such as the steep rise in unconditional offers to sixth-formers, reopened questions over the admissions system and its calendar, as part of a review being carried out by the Office for Students (OfS), the higher education regulator for England. \u201cI recognise that we need to review if the current system is working as well as it can, so I am glad the OfS is looking at whether it would be in students\u2019 interests to apply for their university place after they have their A-level results,\u201d Williamson said. The education secretary\u2019s remarks came as the Department for Education (DfE) published Williamson\u2019s letter of direction to the OfS. \u201cI would endorse the proposal to use the review to consider the pros and cons of potential models of post-qualification application (PQA),\u201d Williamson told the OfS. \u201cWhile this has been considered before, the context in which the sector is operating has changed.\u201d He said the review should be an opportunity to \u201cfurther improve and develop the admissions system so that it remains fair and transparent for students both now and in the future, particularly for students from disadvantaged backgrounds\u201d. Williamson and the DfE are said to be \u201copen-minded\u201d on PQA, as a way of tackling the growth in unconditional offers in which sixth-formers are offered places without even having sat their A-level or BTec exams. Some headteachers blame unconditional offers for pupils \u201ccoasting\u201d and getting lower than expected A-level grades. But many also oppose the changes that a switch to a post-qualifications system would entail, such as moving A-level exams earlier in the year for grades to be published before applications. Increasing numbers of students are using post-qualification admissions for courses still on offer after exam results are published, known as clearing. Williamson is said to be particularly interested in the University of Cambridge\u2019s efforts to get around the lack of exam results \u2013 it now offers a \u201csecond chance\u201d to high-performing disadvantaged candidates who narrowly missed out on a place during initial applications. Research has found that about 1,000 high-achieving students from disadvantaged backgrounds have their grades under-predicted each year, which can force them to wait a year to reapply. Williamson\u2019s letter to the OfS included a revival of the government\u2019s teaching excellence and student outcomes framework (Tef), which ranks institutions based on data such as drop-out rates, graduate employment and student satisfaction. Williamson called for the OfS to conduct a new Tef exercise for each subject taught at a university, to be published in 2021, as well as a new round of Tef assessments for each higher education provider to be published in 2020. The move to extend the Tef to individual subjects was criticised by Universities UK (UUK), which lobbies on behalf of Britain\u2019s major universities and colleges. \u201cThe current definition of excellence is weighted heavily towards employment outcomes, which overlooks the wider benefits of receiving high quality teaching and learning and how this can be measured,\u201d UUK said. It called for subject-level Tef assessments \u201cto be halted until further consideration is given to the limitations of its methodology, the resource impact and how much actual value it gives students in their decision-making\u201d. UUK welcomed another of Williamson\u2019s proposals to the OfS, for a review of part-time, mature student and flexible learning provision, including a review of funding for flexible learning. One of the failings of the English education system since 2012 has been the steep drop in mature and part-time students, which has been largely overlooked by policymakers. Williamson also told the OfS to pay greater attention to the experiences of international students on British university campuses, including their mental health, wellbeing and employability. \u201cIt will, therefore, be critical to ensure the OfS makes public transparent data on the outcomes achieved by international students, including those studying wholly outside the UK [such as at the overseas campuses of UK universities], such as it does for domestic students,\u201d Williamson wrote.",

      "body": "<p>The first image David Chase had in mind for the show that became <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jun/08/the-sopranos-10-years-since-it-finished-its-still-the-most-masterful-show-ever\">The Sopranos</a> was a closeup of Tony Soprano opening his eyes, \u201cwaking up for the day\u201d. That scene ended up falling later in the pilot. The opening scene, as any of the show\u2019s superfans will happily inform you, watches Tony eyeing up a sculpture in a therapist\u2019s waiting room with baffled rage. The show is 20 years old this year, and if that makes you feel ancient, \u201cthink how I feel,\u201d says creator David Chase, who, at 74, is ferocious looking, with beady black eyes and the intense, long-suffering air of the protagonist whose name has become synonymous with his own.</p> <p>If The Sopranos was groundbreaking at its debut two decades ago, it now occupies an even rarer category: a show that has become more admired and beloved with time. The Guardian has named The Sopranos the best TV show of the century so far, and its influence continues to be felt across viewing platforms that didn\u2019t exist at the time of its conception. The prestige TV series, which unspools like a Russian novel but engages like a telenovela, set the tone for the boom in high-quality binge-programming \u2013 funny, smart, acutely well-observed and immensely addictive \u2013 that has reinvented the form.</p> <p>Chase conceived of The Sopranos after decades of writing for network shows such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/jul/20/james-garner\">The Rockford Files</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2010/oct/22/northern-exposure-next-box-set\">Northern Exposure</a>. He was entirely unsurprised when Fox turned down the idea. \u201cThey don\u2019t trust their audience at all,\u201d he says. The Sopranos was too indeterminate; not a straightforward mob drama but not a mob comedy, either, although it is funny. In terms of character development, it\u2019s too slow for network tastes. And then there was Tony himself. \u201cI think they were afraid of it. Because how could you like this guy?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"33985a0ea80befd65c2bd02dbca0ffa271799e87\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/33985a0ea80befd65c2bd02dbca0ffa271799e87/0_274_5892_3535/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Tony is too fat, he\u2019s too crude\u2019 ...

David Chase.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ali Smith/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Sopranos ended up at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/hbo\">HBO</a>. Surprisingly, Chase thinks it would have a tough time being commissioned today, in spite of the fact that, after six seasons and 86 episodes, it is credited with changing audience tastes. \u201cIn this landscape? Sure,\u201d he says. \u201cTony Soprano is too fat. He\u2019s too crude. Who cares about New Jersey? I\u2019ve seen these guys before.\u201d There is a long pause. \u201cIt\u2019s not dystopian enough. Everything seems to be dystopian now, and this isn\u2019t.\u201d Plus, I suggest, nobody in television can predict what\u2019s going to work.</p> <p>\u201cRight, exactly. They buy something then they hate it. They hate whatever they buy. They\u2019re all excited when they buy it, a week goes by and then they hate it. They hated Seinfeld. All that.\u201d</p> <p>We are in Chase\u2019s office in midtown Manhattan, where he is working on his new project, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/mar/08/david-chase-to-make-sopranos-prequel-movie-the-many-saints-of-newark\">The Many Saints of Newark</a>: a movie prequel to The Sopranos set in 1967 that follows Tony and the other protagonists as young men. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jan/23/james-gandolfini-son-michael-cast-as-tony-soprano-prequel-movie-many-saints-of-newark\">The young Tony will be played by James Gandolfini\u2019s son, Michael</a>. Chase originally wanted to work in film; until his own show changed the balance of power, he and almost everyone else in Hollywood considered TV the inferior medium. Now that his wish has come true, he finds himself, with effortless pessimism, missing some elements of the HBO experience. \u201cIt made me appreciate the fact that we could write so quickly, on command, for a deadline. Sort of like journalism. Crank it out.\u201d Is making a movie agonising? \u201cYes it is. I read the other day that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/dec/21/alfonso-cuaron-on-roma-we-cast-for-almost-a-year-i-couldnt-find-the-right-person\">Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n wrote Roma</a> in six days or something.\u201d He looks immensely depressed. \u201cI could never do that.\u201d</p> <p>Returning to Tony\u2019s childhood has been a strange experience. By the end of filming The Sopranos, Chase and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/jun/20/james-gandolfini-the-sopranos-dies\">James Gandolfini, who died in 2013</a>, were thoroughly sick of each other. \u201cHe was tired of me, for sure. And I was kind of tired of him. But then we went on to make a movie together [2012\u2019s <a href=\"https://youtu.be/PeOO_6UZzuA\">Not Fade Away</a>] and things were fine. It was refreshed.\u201d So too, after two decades, is Chase\u2019s interest in the show\u2019s backstory, although revisiting the characters has not been simple. Not only is the film is set in a different era, but the setting \u2013 downtown Newark, as opposed to the New Jersey suburbs where Chase grew up \u2013 is unfamiliar. To tell the story of Tony\u2019s childhood, Chase is ranging further outside his own experience than he did while concocting some of the show\u2019s more outlandish plot lines.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9qpFgAa52U\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/u9qpFgAa52U?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9qpFgAa52U\">Watch a trailer for Series 1 of The Sopranos</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The common factor, of course, is the psychological acuity with which Chase writes. The success of The Sopranos lies in the instantly recognisable relationship between Tony and his toxic mother Livia, which Chase based on his relationship with his own mother. The sense of Tony\u2019s mid-career burnout drew on Chase\u2019s own experience too, although when he rewatches early episodes now, what strikes him is how young Gandolfini was \u2013 only 35 in the pilot. \u201cI see him now and he looks like a kid.\u201d</p> <p>It was Gandolfini\u2019s charm, says Chase, that accounted for so much of the show\u2019s popularity, particularly the tricky act of getting audiences to sympathise with a killer. \u201cI could tell you a million reasons, but one of them, I\u2019m pretty sure, is that Jim Gandolfini was a magnet. He was impeccable. His eyes are sad. They\u2019re alive. His problems are our problems.\u201d</p> <p>Chase\u2019s mother was already dead when he wrote The Sopranos; he doubts he could\u2019ve written the show had she still been around. Looking back, he thinks he went overboard in characterising his childhood as bad. In fact, it was largely happy, a childhood in which he was \u201cfree to roam and do what I wanted. Break windows.\u201d His father owned a hardware store and his mother, although difficult, didn\u2019t interfere in his life too much at that stage. He wrote about her before The Sopranos, he says, and \u201cshe didn\u2019t recognise herself. I did an episode of The Rockford Files that was kind of like The Sopranos, about an Italian mother and her son who\u2019s a hit man. They were going to give him up so that the mob boss would give her a house. It was a similar tone. She didn\u2019t get it.\u201d</p> <p>Was she proud of his TV career? \u201cNot particularly. She didn\u2019t understand it. My mother was a great one for saying, \u2018who do you think you are?\u2019 I took her to the airport one time in Los Angeles and we were waiting for the plane. I said, \u2018Did you ever have Thai food?\u2019 I was crazy about Thai food at that time. She said no. I said, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s great.\u2019 She said\u201d \u2013 Chase\u2019s tone sharpens into sarcasm \u2013 \u201c\u2018Oh really? You\u2019re becoming quite a man of the world.\u2019\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cAnd her last words to me as she got on the plane were: \u2018Don\u2019t get too cocky.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"330fdcbb5cf58650277d4e7b9ad9bc564c556a98\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/330fdcbb5cf58650277d4e7b9ad9bc564c556a98/0_8_1488_962/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The doctor will fear you now \u2026 Gandolfini with Lorraine Bracco as therapist Dr Jennifer Melfi.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"647\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The doctor will fear you now \u2026 Gandolfini with Lorraine Bracco as therapist Dr Jennifer Melfi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HBO/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One of the mistakes Chase says he made while writing the original pilot for The Sopranos was trying to make it palatable to network tastes: \u201cIt was a mob show but I didn\u2019t have anybody murdered. And I think that might\u2019ve been one of the reasons why it didn\u2019t sell.\u201d For a while, he had been happy turning out formulaic scripts on hit shows with big mainstream audiences, not least because it was so well paid. \u201cI mean, that\u2019s the problem: the money. The money was attractive, particularly when you\u2019re raising a family. And I was lucky in that I was working with people who made shows that weren\u2019t disgusting to work on.\u201d<br><br>And yet, \u201cthere was always a grain of something else, bugging me. I just didn\u2019t feel I was right for that medium. I was very lucky, but I was just never happy, never content.\u201d</p> <p>Some of this was because of Chase\u2019s ornery nature. But he also chafed against the more absurd notes that came down from network executives. \u201cI remember one time on The Rockford Files, we had a meeting before the season started. And the guy who was our new liaison with the network gave us a list of story ideas they\u2019d like to see for the season. One was Jim\u2019s real daughter, Gigi, is kidnapped and Jim has to go find her. Another was a baby is left on Jim\u2019s doorstep. Stuff like that.\u201d He shakes his head in what-a-world fashion. \u201cIt\u2019s absurd.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2f7b2c778a100eb40d6670ace5db77689381800a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f7b2c778a100eb40d6670ace5db77689381800a/0_45_1403_841/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Don\u2019t get too cocky ...

Nancy Marchand as Tony\u2019s mother Livia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HO/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Most of Chase\u2019s work is character driven, and his first idea for The Sopranos came from the central dynamic between Tony and \u201cthe mother who was problematic and sent to a nursing home; she was his real enemy. That was the first thought. I had that idea for a movie, but my agent at the time told me that mob comedies weren\u2019t happening, so I put it aside.\u201d Around that time, he was asked if he\u2019d be interested in doing a TV version of The Godfather. Chase refused \u2013 \u201cbecause it had been done\u201d \u2013 but it revived his interest in his own mob idea. \u201cI was thinking, not The Godfather, but I have that thing about the guy going to therapy. Maybe I\u2019ll try that.\u201d</p> <p>A mobster-in-therapy was a funny idea, but Chase didn\u2019t see it as a sendup. He himself had been saved by therapy; without it, he would almost certainly have driven away his wife, Denise Kelly, to whom he has been married for almost 50 years: \u201cShe saved my life.\u201d He first saw a therapist when he was 31, after his wife\u2019s sister died of a brain aneurysm. Kelly was grieving, but on the way back from the funeral, all Chase could do was complain about how awful his mother had been. She had been pretty awful; when he rang her to break the news of his sister-in-law\u2019s death, \u201cshe said, \u2018She died from what?\u2019 I said, \u2018A brain aneurysm.\u2019 She said, \u2018You see David? She was too smart.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>His mother\u2019s response was beside the point, of course. \u201cMy wife had lost her sister and all I could talk about was my parents and the problems they created for me. I was just totally selfish. And my wife said to me, \u2018You need help.\u2019\u201d He was in therapy on and off for years and says it helped him immeasurably, although he is still constitutionally inclined to be \u201cgnawed to death by doubt\u201d \u2013 the main antidote to which is his wife. \u201cIt\u2019s not that she is Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm, she\u2019s not a Pollyanna.

      "bodyText": "The first image David Chase had in mind for the show that became The Sopranos was a closeup of Tony Soprano opening his eyes, \u201cwaking up for the day\u201d. That scene ended up falling later in the pilot. The opening scene, as any of the show\u2019s superfans will happily inform you, watches Tony eyeing up a sculpture in a therapist\u2019s waiting room with baffled rage. The show is 20 years old this year, and if that makes you feel ancient, \u201cthink how I feel,\u201d says creator David Chase, who, at 74, is ferocious looking, with beady black eyes and the intense, long-suffering air of the protagonist whose name has become synonymous with his own. If The Sopranos was groundbreaking at its debut two decades ago, it now occupies an even rarer category: a show that has become more admired and beloved with time. The Guardian has named The Sopranos the best TV show of the century so far, and its influence continues to be felt across viewing platforms that didn\u2019t exist at the time of its conception. The prestige TV series, which unspools like a Russian novel but engages like a telenovela, set the tone for the boom in high-quality binge-programming \u2013 funny, smart, acutely well-observed and immensely addictive \u2013 that has reinvented the form. Chase conceived of The Sopranos after decades of writing for network shows such as The Rockford Files and Northern Exposure. He was entirely unsurprised when Fox turned down the idea. \u201cThey don\u2019t trust their audience at all,\u201d he says. The Sopranos was too indeterminate; not a straightforward mob drama but not a mob comedy, either, although it is funny. In terms of character development, it\u2019s too slow for network tastes. And then there was Tony himself. \u201cI think they were afraid of it. Because how could you like this guy?\u201d The Sopranos ended up at HBO. Surprisingly, Chase thinks it would have a tough time being commissioned today, in spite of the fact that, after six seasons and 86 episodes, it is credited with changing audience tastes. \u201cIn this landscape? Sure,\u201d he says. \u201cTony Soprano is too fat. He\u2019s too crude. Who cares about New Jersey? I\u2019ve seen these guys before.\u201d There is a long pause. \u201cIt\u2019s not dystopian enough. Everything seems to be dystopian now, and this isn\u2019t.\u201d Plus, I suggest, nobody in television can predict what\u2019s going to work. \u201cRight, exactly. They buy something then they hate it. They hate whatever they buy. They\u2019re all excited when they buy it, a week goes by and then they hate it. They hated Seinfeld. All that.\u201d We are in Chase\u2019s office in midtown Manhattan, where he is working on his new project, The Many Saints of Newark: a movie prequel to The Sopranos set in 1967 that follows Tony and the other protagonists as young men. The young Tony will be played by James Gandolfini\u2019s son, Michael. Chase originally wanted to work in film; until his own show changed the balance of power, he and almost everyone else in Hollywood considered TV the inferior medium. Now that his wish has come true, he finds himself, with effortless pessimism, missing some elements of the HBO experience. \u201cIt made me appreciate the fact that we could write so quickly, on command, for a deadline. Sort of like journalism. Crank it out.\u201d Is making a movie agonising? \u201cYes it is. I read the other day that Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n wrote Roma in six days or something.\u201d He looks immensely depressed. \u201cI could never do that.\u201d Returning to Tony\u2019s childhood has been a strange experience. By the end of filming The Sopranos, Chase and James Gandolfini, who died in 2013, were thoroughly sick of each other. \u201cHe was tired of me, for sure. And I was kind of tired of him. But then we went on to make a movie together [2012\u2019s Not Fade Away] and things were fine. It was refreshed.\u201d So too, after two decades, is Chase\u2019s interest in the show\u2019s backstory, although revisiting the characters has not been simple. Not only is the film is set in a different era, but the setting \u2013 downtown Newark, as opposed to the New Jersey suburbs where Chase grew up \u2013 is unfamiliar. To tell the story of Tony\u2019s childhood, Chase is ranging further outside his own experience than he did while concocting some of the show\u2019s more outlandish plot lines. The common factor, of course, is the psychological acuity with which Chase writes. The success of The Sopranos lies in the instantly recognisable relationship between Tony and his toxic mother Livia, which Chase based on his relationship with his own mother. The sense of Tony\u2019s mid-career burnout drew on Chase\u2019s own experience too, although when he rewatches early episodes now, what strikes him is how young Gandolfini was \u2013 only 35 in the pilot. \u201cI see him now and he looks like a kid.\u201d It was Gandolfini\u2019s charm, says Chase, that accounted for so much of the show\u2019s popularity, particularly the tricky act of getting audiences to sympathise with a killer. \u201cI could tell you a million reasons, but one of them, I\u2019m pretty sure, is that Jim Gandolfini was a magnet. He was impeccable. His eyes are sad. They\u2019re alive. His problems are our problems.\u201d Chase\u2019s mother was already dead when he wrote The Sopranos; he doubts he could\u2019ve written the show had she still been around. Looking back, he thinks he went overboard in characterising his childhood as bad. In fact, it was largely happy, a childhood in which he was \u201cfree to roam and do what I wanted. Break windows.\u201d His father owned a hardware store and his mother, although difficult, didn\u2019t interfere in his life too much at that stage. He wrote about her before The Sopranos, he says, and \u201cshe didn\u2019t recognise herself. I did an episode of The Rockford Files that was kind of like The Sopranos, about an Italian mother and her son who\u2019s a hit man. They were going to give him up so that the mob boss would give her a house. It was a similar tone. She didn\u2019t get it.\u201d Was she proud of his TV career? \u201cNot particularly. She didn\u2019t understand it. My mother was a great one for saying, \u2018who do you think you are?\u2019 I took her to the airport one time in Los Angeles and we were waiting for the plane. I said, \u2018Did you ever have Thai food?\u2019 I was crazy about Thai food at that time. She said no. I said, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s great.\u2019 She said\u201d \u2013 Chase\u2019s tone sharpens into sarcasm \u2013 \u201c\u2018Oh really? You\u2019re becoming quite a man of the world.\u2019\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cAnd her last words to me as she got on the plane were: \u2018Don\u2019t get too cocky.\u2019\u201d One of the mistakes Chase says he made while writing the original pilot for The Sopranos was trying to make it palatable to network tastes: \u201cIt was a mob show but I didn\u2019t have anybody murdered. And I think that might\u2019ve been one of the reasons why it didn\u2019t sell.\u201d For a while, he had been happy turning out formulaic scripts on hit shows with big mainstream audiences, not least because it was so well paid. \u201cI mean, that\u2019s the problem: the money. The money was attractive, particularly when you\u2019re raising a family. And I was lucky in that I was working with people who made shows that weren\u2019t disgusting to work on.\u201d And yet, \u201cthere was always a grain of something else, bugging me. I just didn\u2019t feel I was right for that medium. I was very lucky, but I was just never happy, never content.\u201d Some of this was because of Chase\u2019s ornery nature. But he also chafed against the more absurd notes that came down from network executives. \u201cI remember one time on The Rockford Files, we had a meeting before the season started. And the guy who was our new liaison with the network gave us a list of story ideas they\u2019d like to see for the season. One was Jim\u2019s real daughter, Gigi, is kidnapped and Jim has to go find her. Another was a baby is left on Jim\u2019s doorstep. Stuff like that.\u201d He shakes his head in what-a-world fashion. \u201cIt\u2019s absurd.\u201d Most of Chase\u2019s work is character driven, and his first idea for The Sopranos came from the central dynamic between Tony and \u201cthe mother who was problematic and sent to a nursing home; she was his real enemy. That was the first thought. I had that idea for a movie, but my agent at the time told me that mob comedies weren\u2019t happening, so I put it aside.\u201d Around that time, he was asked if he\u2019d be interested in doing a TV version of The Godfather. Chase refused \u2013 \u201cbecause it had been done\u201d \u2013 but it revived his interest in his own mob idea. \u201cI was thinking, not The Godfather, but I have that thing about the guy going to therapy. Maybe I\u2019ll try that.\u201d A mobster-in-therapy was a funny idea, but Chase didn\u2019t see it as a sendup. He himself had been saved by therapy; without it, he would almost certainly have driven away his wife, Denise Kelly, to whom he has been married for almost 50 years: \u201cShe saved my life.\u201d He first saw a therapist when he was 31, after his wife\u2019s sister died of a brain aneurysm. Kelly was grieving, but on the way back from the funeral, all Chase could do was complain about how awful his mother had been. She had been pretty awful; when he rang her to break the news of his sister-in-law\u2019s death, \u201cshe said, \u2018She died from what?\u2019 I said, \u2018A brain aneurysm.\u2019 She said, \u2018You see David? She was too smart.\u2019\u201d His mother\u2019s response was beside the point, of course. \u201cMy wife had lost her sister and all I could talk about was my parents and the problems they created for me. I was just totally selfish. And my wife said to me, \u2018You need help.\u2019\u201d He was in therapy on and off for years and says it helped him immeasurably, although he is still constitutionally inclined to be \u201cgnawed to death by doubt\u201d \u2013 the main antidote to which is his wife. \u201cIt\u2019s not that she is Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm, she\u2019s not a Pollyanna. But she\u2019s not subject to this endless dismal terror and negativity. She doesn\u2019t think that way.\u201d These days, Chase understands that happiness is a moving target.

Should I have the veal cutlet, should I have something else? Waiter! I\u2019m going to change my order! But directing, you have to make decisions quickly.\u201d The one thing Chase has no anxiety about is The Sopranos\u2019 endlessly deliberated ending. It ended the show with a precise degree of ambiguity that honoured the subtleties of the preceding six series, although its lack of resolution left some viewers complaining that they wanted closure. \u201cI would say that there\u2019s more symmetry than meets the eye,\u201d he says.

Under the proposed settlement, which is backed by about half the states and thousands of local governments that are suing Purdue, the Sacklers will hand the firm\u2019s assets over to a trust. It will operate a reformed company, whose board will be selected by the claimants and approved by the bankruptcy court. Money generated by the new firm could be used for drug treatment. The settlement is worth less than the $12bn originally envisaged. The company listed assets of up to $10bn and debts of $1bn in its chapter 11 filing. The bankruptcy court will decide how the money is allocated among the states, cities and counties. The Sacklers have agreed to contribute at least $3bn as part of the settlement, from funds generated by selling Purdue\u2019s UK-based subsidiary Mundipharma. Their contribution became a sticking point during the discussions. Steve Miller, the chairman of Purdue\u2019s board of directors, which met on Sunday night to approve the long-expected bankruptcy filing, said: \u201cThis unique framework for a comprehensive resolution will dedicate all of the assets and resources of Purdue for the benefit of the American public. \u201cThis settlement framework avoids wasting hundreds of millions of dollars and years on protracted litigation, and instead will provide billions of dollars and critical resources to communities across the country trying to cope with the opioid crisis. We will continue to work with state attorneys general and other plaintiff representatives to finalise and implement this agreement as quickly as possible.\u201d Purdue said the deal was backed by 24 states and five US territories, as well as lead lawyers for more than 2,000 cities, counties and other plaintiffs. However, two dozen states remain opposed or uncommitted to the proposed settlement. Opposing states, including Massachusetts, New York and Connecticut, want the Sacklers to contribute more of their own money towards the settlement. Their opposition could complicate the bankruptcy process. Members of the Sackler family also face lawsuits, seeking billions of dollars in damages, that claim the company and family aggressively marketed prescription painkillers while misleading doctors and patients about their addiction and overdose risks. Purdue and the Sacklers have denied the allegations. The Delaware attorney general Kathy Jennings said in a statement: \u201cIrrespective of Purdue\u2019s actions or evasion, we will continue to pursue justice on behalf of those harmed by the Sacklers\u2019 greed, callousness and fraud.\u201d Members of the Sackler family said they hoped those opposing the current settlement offer would change their minds. \u201cWe are hopeful that in time, those parties who are not yet supportive will ultimately shift their focus to the critical resources that the settlement provides to people and problems that need them.\u201d Miller said the company had not admitted wrongdoing and does not intend to. \u201cThe alternative is to not settle but instead to resume the litigation,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cThe resumption of litigation would rapidly diminish all the resources of the company and would be lose-lose-lose all the way around. Whatever people might wish for is not on the table now.\u201d",

A highly critical report by the independent NSW Natural Resources Commission a month ago described the Barwon-Darling as \u201can ecosystem in crisis\u201d and warned that \u201cthe current cease-to-flow period is the longest since records began\u201d. The previous water minister, Niall Blair, brought forward the review of the system\u2019s water-sharing plan after the fish kills at Menindee on the lower Darling last summer. More are expected this year. The 2012 water-sharing rules were always controversial, amid allegations that late changes were made after heavy lobbying by the cotton industry. The commission recommended action to address the extraction of water during critical low-flow periods as a matter of urgency. Controversially, its draft report said the extraction by irrigators during these dry periods had pushed the lower Darling into hydrological drought three years earlier than under normal conditions. The NRC identified new flow targets to protect critical ecosystems and improve river health \u2013 in particular, new rules for A-class licences (the most secure water rights) to prevent pumping when the river falls to a low level. It also recommended dropping the rules that allow licence-holders to pump in anticipation of flows, and imposing greater protections for environmental flows. That will mean less water for irrigators during dry spells. Guardian Australia understands the water minister, Melinda Pavey, proposes to adopt some of the recommendations, but not all.

Abortion has been a criminal offence in New South Wales since 1900, and unlawfully procuring an abortion is punishable by up to 10 years' imprisonment. Doctors are able to conduct abortions if they believe the pregnancy is a risk to a woman\u2019s physical or mental health, and a common law precedent set in 1971 means social and economic factors may also be taken into consideration. Laws before the NSW parliament would make abortion legal on request up to 22 weeks, and with the approval of two doctors beyond that.</p>\n    <p><b>Queensland</b><br>The NSW legislation is based off the bill that passed in Queensland last year. Abortion is legal until 22 weeks gestation, and thereafter with the approval of two doctors.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Victoria</b><br>Legal to 24 weeks and then after 24 weeks with two doctors\u2019 approval.</p>\n    <p><b>ACT</b><br>Legal. Until last year, only a registered medical practitioner could carry out the procedure in an approved facility. However a change to ACT law last year now allows general practitioners to prescribe abortion drugs such as MS\u20112 Step.</p>\n    <p><b>South Australia</b><br>Legal up to 28 weeks but only if two doctors agree that a woman\u2019s physical and/or mental health is endangered by pregnancy, or for serious foetal abnormality. Unlawful abortion remains a crime. Terminations must be performed in a \"prescribed hospital\".</p>\n    <p><b>Western Australia</b><br>Legal up to 20 weeks but women must be given the opportunity to participate in counselling before a termination can be performed. Teenage girls under 16 require a parent to be informed. After 20 weeks, terminations become much more difficult to access. A woman must receive approval from two doctors from a statutory panel of six who agree the woman, or her foetus, has a \"severe medical condition\" that justifies the procedure.<br></p>\n    <p><b>Tasmania</b><br>Lawful on request up to 16 weeks, and beyond that point with the agreement of two doctors.<br></p>\n    <p><b>Northern Territory</b><br>Legal to 14 weeks with one doctor's approval, and after that to 23 weeks with an additional doctor. Beyond 23 weeks, abortions cannot be performed unless it is performed to save a pregnant person's life.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cI am not shocked the claim came from Life Choice Australia, who are hosting the video on Facebook and Twitter, but I am really disappointed in media who are uncritically spreading it around, broadcasting it, either on TV or radio or in articles online,\u201d Canning told Guardian Australia.</p> \n<p>\u201cI have had young women on the phone to me crying their eyes out because they can\u2019t believe their words are being completely misconstrued and lied about in the media.</p> \n<p>\u201cI am pretty incensed that they are taking the word of anti-abortion groups and reporting on them without speaking to us.

      "bodyText": "\u201cI don\u2019t want people to faint, but if they do, they do.\u201d The British theatremaker Bryony Kimmings is describing reactions to a moment in her new show, I\u2019m a Phoenix, Bitch. \u201cThere\u2019s a bit \u2026 where I talk about [my son] Frank\u2019s eyes,\u201d Kimmings tells me. \u201cIt\u2019s quite a graphic description of what happens to his eyes, and three times we\u2019ve had people faint and had to have a show stop.\u201d Kimmings gained international renown on the festival circuit for 2015\u2019s Fake It \u2019Til You Make It, a show made with her partner that showed the impacts of living with his clinical depression. She describes her staged works to date as \u201cautobiographical experiment\u201d. In 2010\u2019s Sex Idiot, she told of retracing her sexual relationships to discover who had given her an STI. In 7 Day Drunk, she mapped the scientific impact of alcohol use on her creativity. I\u2019m a Phoenix, Bitch \u2013 which premiered in the UK last year, and is now touring Australia \u2013 is \u201canother bloody mental health show\u201d, she says, and tells the raw story of the worst year of the writer-performer\u2019s life. Despite the enormous success of Fake It \u2019Til You Make It, Kimmings suffered a breakdown in its wake; the birth of their son Frank brought unexpected complications. \u201cI think everyone has postnatal depression, to be honest,\u201d she tells me. \u201cI don\u2019t know a mother who hasn\u2019t gone a bit loopy. Neither of us knew how to cope with me going insane.\u201d And then it got worse. \u201cMy son got very ill. He got something called West syndrome. At four months old, he started having these seizures and began regressing to a newborn state.\u201d As they began treating Frank for the infantile epileptic disorder, the relationship imploded. Kimmings and her partner were still touring. \u201cWe had to cancel the tour and the shit hit the fan,\u201d she explains. Inspiration to make the new show came while she was still living through its subject matter. \u201cI put on Twitter: our son is fucking ill, we\u2019re bamboozled and we can\u2019t tour, we\u2019re not doing gigs,\u201d says Kimmings, \u201cAnd someone wrote, \u2018At least it\u2019ll be good for another show.\u2019 I thought, \u2018No way, this is too heartbreaking\u2019 \u2026 but then I started to talk to all these women who\u2019d had psychotic episodes after having children, and other women who were coping with the problems their children had.\u201d Kimmings realised she was hardly alone confronting the gap between lived motherhood and \u201cthe sugarcoated shit you\u2019re given\u201d. For all the understood rewards of motherhood, it\u2019s also \u201chard, dirty, horrible, weird, fucked-up\u201d, she says. \u201cAnd I thought, \u2018I have to make [this show] now.\u2019 The emotional fuel was quite potent.\u201d The new show straddles stage genres. It\u2019s high culture meets pop art meets group therapy meets Le Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Grand-Guignol \u2013 and on a much more spectacular scale than the low-budget fringe aesthetic that tends to be imposed on feminist work. Postnatal mental heath \u201cisn\u2019t the sexiest of topics\u201d, Kimming admits, but she was emboldened viewing productions of Complicit\u00e9 theatre\u2019s The Encounter and Robert Lepage\u2019s 887. Both relate, with painful intensity, the personal stories of their creators. \u201cI loved them both,\u201d she says, but she realised this was \u201cbig-dick-swinging, auteur performance that you never see women do. I thought, \u2018What the fuck?\u2019 \u2026 I\u2019ve never seen women in the UK stand on a stage that big with that much money thrown at it.\u201d Her own tale was \u201cthe hidden tiny story that never gets [told]\u201d; and her determination to make it \u201chuge and slick\u201d was for all the women-led shows whose scale of grandeur never approached that of shows by Complicit\u00e9 or Lepage. Inherently, I\u2019m a Phoenix, Bitch, is Kimmings\u2019 response to the gendered assumptions of the theatre. \u201cWhy in every fucking show does the woman die, or is raped, or survives because she\u2019s rescued by some dude who slides in and sorts it all out?\u201d she says. \u201cNora in a Doll\u2019s House, Medea \u2026 I thought, \u2018Fuck you, I\u2019m going to do this show, because I went crazy and now I\u2019m not crazy and I did it all my fucking self.\u2019\u201d The show may be about \u201chow someone might drag themselves out of that kind of abyss\u201d, but retelling her own story doesn\u2019t neutralise its provocations. \u201cI\u2019ve had to work very hard with my therapist, my boyfriend and my crew to work it out \u2026 I did it for three weeks, I had this huge breakdown and was back on my meds.\u201d In its next run, \u201cpositive affirmations and meditations\u201d helped, but \u201copening the wound\u201d meant she had to find ways of closing it.

From that practice has come the West Arnhem Land fire abatement project under which industry, government and community work together to offset greenhouse gas emissions. Since it began in 2006, rangers have abated more than 1.7m tonnes of greenhouse gases. Across the top end, the pride in the ranger uniform is high, and it is contagious. \u201cBeing out on country, being one with the country, the feeling is indescribable,\u201d Cox says. \u201cYou don\u2019t get that feeling in a town, or even our community. Out there, you\u2019re at peace. \u201cYou\u2019re busy when you\u2019re out there working but when you sit back, you see that everything connects and there\u2019s a purpose to it all.\u201d The women control invasive weeds, do burnoffs according to traditional seasonal knowledge and track endangered species. \u201cWe say we work with plants, but we are not just looking at plants,\u201d Cox says. \u201cThose plants tell us about the seasons. Which fruits are growing or what\u2019s flowering tell you what fish are running, what animals are ready to hunt. It\u2019s all connected. \u201cSometimes we don\u2019t realise the value of what we have in this country.\u201d Says Sibosado: \u201cWe know our country. We do our burning off at the right time, to protect endangered plants and animals. We monitor marine debris \u2013 it\u2019s a major problem.\u201d Clearing plastic off remote beaches is a big job for rangers all across the northern coastline of Australia. Last year the Dhimurru rangers in eastern Arnhem Land collected two and a half tonnes of rubbish, including 20kg of cigarette lighters and 32kg of plastic bags: roughly five times the amount they collected in 2016. \u201cMen rangers do the marine work on the water, women are land-based,\u201d Cox says. \u201cBut we are getting more and more involved in what they do. \u201cWe\u2019ve been so good at our work that the men have had to step up,\u201d Sibosado adds, laughing. \u201cThey can see our potential. They see they\u2019d better watch out because we could be taking over! \u201cAs coordinator I love being there, working with younger women. You\u2019re working to build their confidence and their self-esteem. They have to talk to tourists, talk to schools. Over the past five years I\u2019ve rally seen those young girls grow.\u201d There\u2019s no shortage of work and no shortage of women who\u2019d like to do it, but the barriers are funding security and access to formal training. \u201cCertainty is needed,\u201d Cox says. \u201cYou can\u2019t look after country if you\u2019re only funded on a six-monthly basis.\u201d Sibosado says: \u201cAs a coordinator, I\u2019d say we are vastly under-represented. Less than 30% of rangers are women. The employment situation is getting better but funding is a big issue.\u201d Both say the job is a privilege and an honour. \u201cWe are going to keep fighting for ranger programs,\u201d Sibosado says. \u201cBecause we know how good it is for our country and for the younger generation. We are working to break the stereotypes of Aboriginal women and we will achieve it.\u201d \u201cWe walk with our heads high,\u201d Devena Cox says. \u201cWe will break that barrier for Aboriginal women in Australia. In looking after country, women play a big role.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Monica Lewinsky will embark on her first ever speaking tour of Australia and Zadie Smith will return for the first time in nearly two decades to headline a new feminist ideas festival. Hosted by Melbourne\u2019s Wheeler Centre in November, the Broadside festival will feature more than 30 high-profile local and international guests, including Helen Garner, Mona Eltahawy, Ariel Levy, Courtney Barnett and Aileen Moreton-Robinson. Lewinsky will appear in conversation to discuss her experience of online harassment culture and her activism around it. In August, the public speaker and contributing editor to Vanity Fair was announced as a producer on a forthcoming series of American Crime Story about her affair with then-US president Bill Clinton while she was a White House intern. \u201cThere\u2019s no better person placed in our culture to discuss online bullying and harassment than Monica Lewinsky,\u201d Broadside director Tam Zimet told Guardian Australia. \u201cHer story has been co-opted and manipulated and used for personal and political gain for purposes that have nothing to do with her for two decades. And it\u2019s taken this long for the culture to catch up. She has been talking about this for two decades and finally she\u2019s in control of her narrative, and finally we all understand what that means.\u201d Zadie Smith will appear in conversation with New Yorker staff writer Jia Tolentino, speaking broadly about her life and writing. She is also scheduled to speak at the Sydney Opera Houseon 10 November. The festival will also feature Helen Garner discussing her forthcoming book based on her diaries, Yellow Notebook. Author of Thick, Tressie McMillan Cottom, will appear alongside Call Your Girlfriend podcast host Aminatou Sow to speak about black feminism. Zimet said the festival had its roots in her conviction that \u201cif we\u2019re not outraged, then we\u2019re not paying attention\u201d. \u201cWhat do we do? Well, what feminists do is we organise and we come together,\u201d she said. The programming draws directly from contemporary political issues, including panels on feminism and capitalism, \u201cdecolonising\u201d feminism, speaking up for one\u2019s rights, and negotiating public space as a woman. Speakers on these panels include pioneering Indigenous Australian feminist Aileen Moreton-Robinson, and writers and activists Fatima Bhutto, Ruby Hamad, Nayuka Gorrie, Michelle Law, Gala Vanting and Jax Jacki Brown. \u201cThese are the issues being discussed between women and gender nonconforming people all around the country, all the time,\u201d Zimet said. \u201cWe wanted to expose as many people as possible to it.\u201d There will also be a \u201cteen day\u201d in which public high school students will attend a free day of talks, workshops, panels and discussion at the Wheeler Centre, focused on \u201ccreating positive action and change\u201d. Zimet, who worked for three years as a programmer at the Sydney writers\u2019 festival, said Melbourne was the obvious place to host a feminist ideas festival. \u201cWe know Melbourne audiences come out for smart feminist programming,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are so many feminist organisations running incredible events right across arts and culture and activism. But the proliferation of these festivals and organisations shows there\u2019s enthusiasm for this, not that there is too much.\u201d She namechecks some of Melbourne\u2019s homegrown feminist outfits, including the Feminist writers\u2019 festival, Fitzroy High School\u2019s feminist collective Your Voice, the Victorian Women\u2019s Trust, the Queen Victoria Women\u2019s Centre and the Stella prize as evidence of the city\u2019s thriving feminist cultural activity. \u201cI\u2019m also very aware and want to acknowledge as well that Broadside sits in Melbourne\u2019s very long history of feminist struggle and collaboration and celebration,\u201d she said. \u201cWe wanted to create a program that\u2019s celebratory but also one with tricky and nuanced conversations.\u201d There will also be a Town Hall-based festival bar \u2013 named Club Skunk, a nod to the lesbian bar in the teen movie Ten Things I Hate About You \u2013 \u201ca place to congregate, have a martini and plan the utter obliteration of the patriarchy,\u201d Zimet said.

Fukushima fisheries officials point out that they operate a stringent testing regime that bans the sale of any seafood found to contain more than 50 becquerels of radioactive material per kilogram \u2013 a much lower threshold than the standard of 100 becquerels per kilogram observed in the rest of Japan.
