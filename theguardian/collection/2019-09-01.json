We definitely look at it and go \u2018it\u2019s just bad timing\u2019. You want consistency with your club and you go away with England, have a little break and play a different formation, play slightly differently. Then you get dropped back in the club. We play Tuesday, arrive back Wednesday, probably have Thursday off. So I\u2019ll be in Reading on Friday, and Saturday, then the game, the first game of the season. Two days preparation.\u201d</p> <p>With the international calendar set by Fifa and the FA juggling the women\u2019s domestic schedule the task of making all competitions fit together is complex. Moore, though, cannot understand how with fewer teams in the league than the Premier League, meaning fewer games, there is such a struggle to fit everything in.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know who does the league or how they plan it out but I never understand how we don\u2019t have enough weeks in the year to play a game a week,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether that\u2019s just me.

And I do get the \u2018well, you\u2019ve got a good squad, you\u2019ve got enough money etc, like, that\u2019s the way football is going to go\u2019 argument.

And as you actually map it out, there\u2019ll be players if they\u2019ve not been injured, that will go 18 months cycles or 24 months cycles where they\u2019ve never had more than probably seven days off. And then you look at injuries and maybe somewhere along the line they\u2019re over-use injuries and just inevitable.\u201d</p> <p>With talks of a possible Fifa World League gaining pace, the calendar for those at the top is only going to get tougher. \u201cThe thing is, as players we want more games, but we also want it to fit better. We don\u2019t want there to be an increase of risk to health.</p> <p>\u201cAround 30 games per season is still not a lot compared to what the men do.

      "bodyText": "The England midfielder Jade Moore has expressed frustration that poor scheduling is stunting preparations for the new Women\u2019s Super League season, which kicks off at the weekend, and disrupting attempts to capitalise on the World Cup as a result. England play Norway in a friendly on Tuesday night, following a 3-3 draw in Belgium on Thursday, and Moore has been forced to withdraw from the camp having picked up a thigh injury. With the opening weekend of the Barclays FA WSL on 7\u20118 September, just days after players return from international duties in Euro 2021 qualifiers and friendlies, there is little time for clubs to ready their senior internationals for the new campaign. \u201cI think we have something like five players next week that are left behind,\u201d said Moore. \u201cWhat are they [Reading\u2019s coaches] meant to do with five players? We definitely look at it and go \u2018it\u2019s just bad timing\u2019. You want consistency with your club and you go away with England, have a little break and play a different formation, play slightly differently. Then you get dropped back in the club. We play Tuesday, arrive back Wednesday, probably have Thursday off. So I\u2019ll be in Reading on Friday, and Saturday, then the game, the first game of the season. Two days preparation.\u201d With the international calendar set by Fifa and the FA juggling the women\u2019s domestic schedule the task of making all competitions fit together is complex. Moore, though, cannot understand how with fewer teams in the league than the Premier League, meaning fewer games, there is such a struggle to fit everything in. \u201cI don\u2019t know who does the league or how they plan it out but I never understand how we don\u2019t have enough weeks in the year to play a game a week,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether that\u2019s just me. I actually really like playing midweek because it breaks my training week up, it doesn\u2019t make it so monotonous. But I don\u2019t get why we cram games in. And I do get the \u2018well, you\u2019ve got a good squad, you\u2019ve got enough money etc, like, that\u2019s the way football is going to go\u2019 argument. But we don\u2019t have many teams we don\u2019t have what the Premiership have. We\u2019re not playing 50-odd games a season.\u201d While frustrated at the ongoing problems, the 28-year-old is well aware that the switch from a summer to a winter season has improved things. \u201cWe rolled from a summer, into an international tournament into a summer league into international qualifiers. And as you actually map it out, there\u2019ll be players if they\u2019ve not been injured, that will go 18 months cycles or 24 months cycles where they\u2019ve never had more than probably seven days off. And then you look at injuries and maybe somewhere along the line they\u2019re over-use injuries and just inevitable.\u201d With talks of a possible Fifa World League gaining pace, the calendar for those at the top is only going to get tougher. \u201cThe thing is, as players we want more games, but we also want it to fit better. We don\u2019t want there to be an increase of risk to health. \u201cAround 30 games per season is still not a lot compared to what the men do. But then if we\u2019re cramming in 15 games in two months, it\u2019s different, isn\u2019t it? \u201cWe\u2019re talking about something completely different than what would be a eight or nine-month season that you play week in week with a couple of two-game weeks. It\u2019s when you end up doing two games, two games, two games that there is a problem.\u201d",

The first, in spring, reflected the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/03/uk-communities-take-action-against-punish-a-muslim-day-letter\">\u201c</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/03/uk-communities-take-action-against-punish-a-muslim-day-letter\">Punish a Muslim day\u201d</a> incident when letters were sent to Muslim homes, institutions and places of work. The letter suggested people could win \u201cpoints\u201d for a range of activities aimed at Muslims, including removing a headscarf from a woman or beating a person up. Muslim MPs also received the letters.</p> \n<p>However,a second, more significant spike occurred in August after Johnson wrote a column referring to veiled Muslim women as \u201cletterboxes\u201d and \u201cbank robbers\u201d.</p> \n<p>In the week following that article, Tell Mama said anti-Muslim incidents increased by 375% \u2013 from eight incidents the previous week, to 38 in the following.</p> \n<p>Of the 38 anti-Muslim hate incidents, 22 were directed at Muslim women who wore the niqab, or face veil.</p> \n<p>The group recorded a total of 57 incidents in the three weeks following the publication of the column by the former foreign secretary and current prime minister, 32 of which were directed at Muslim women. It said that between 5 and 29 August, 42% of the street-based incidents reported to Tell Mama directly referenced Johnson and the language used in his column.</p> \n<p>Johnson was widely <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/aug/08/tories-under-pressure-over-disciplinary-action-against-boris-johnson\">criticised by senior Tories after making the remarks</a>, with demands for an apology from the then party chairman, Brandon Lewis.</p> \n<p>In the article in question, Johnson had said he felt \u201cfully entitled\u201d to expect women to remove face coverings when talking to him at his MP\u2019s surgery. He also said schools and universities should be able to take the same approach if a student \u201cturns up \u2026 looking like a bank robber\u201d.</p> \n<p>Johnson had called the burqa \u201coppressive\u201d, adding it was \u201cabsolutely ridiculous that people should choose to go around looking like letter boxes\u201d.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/22/far-right-violence-on-rise-where-is-outrage\">Far-right violence is on the rise.

The investigation into whether he broke party rules was triggered automatically after the receipt of a number of complaints over the column.</p> \n<p>A spokesperson for Tell Mama said: \u201cThe rising instances of discrimination, hate speech, and anti-Muslim literature indicate that a more general intolerance and hatred is growing. These typologies are seldom prosecutable by law and have proven more difficult to achieve satisfactory outcomes and solutions for victims.</p> \n<p>\u201cSimilarly, this year we analysed the trends in verbal abuse, finding a common theme whereby perpetrators use language attacking Islam and religious practices alongside, for example, anti-Muslim hate incidents that range from abusive behaviour, discrimination, or threats.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe therefore emphasise the gravity of attacks on Islam in tandem with hatred directed at individuals or institutions. The two are interconnected, thus hatred and intolerance must both be challenged simultaneously.\u201d</p> \n<p>In total Tell Mama recorded 1,072 verified anti-Muslim or Islamophobic reports. Of the 1,072 cases, 745 occurred at a street level and 327 were online.</p> \n<p>Over the three years to 2018, the group said it recorded a steady annual increase in street-based anti-Muslim incidents.

Incidents which took place within the victim\u2019s household or private property increased by 11%, and those at the victim\u2019s place of work rose by 8% since the previous year.</p> \n<p>Consistent with previous reports, the majority of victims were female at 57% and the main perpetrators were male.</p> \n<p>Iman Atta, the director of Tell Mama, said: \u201cWe are in a period of instability, politically and socially. Even in 2018, when there were no major terrorist attacks in comparison to 2017, when there were four of them in the United Kingdom, levels of anti-Muslim hatred or Islamophobia have remained stubbornly high. In fact, levels in 2018 equalled those of 2017 when the major terrorist attacks took place.</p> \n<p>\u201cAnti-Muslim hatred has become an issue that is not going away and which has been growing since we started supporting victims of anti-Muslim hate in 2011. We ask all politicians to reflect on the future of our country.\u201d</p>",

The letter suggested people could win \u201cpoints\u201d for a range of activities aimed at Muslims, including removing a headscarf from a woman or beating a person up. Muslim MPs also received the letters. However,a second, more significant spike occurred in August after Johnson wrote a column referring to veiled Muslim women as \u201cletterboxes\u201d and \u201cbank robbers\u201d. In the week following that article, Tell Mama said anti-Muslim incidents increased by 375% \u2013 from eight incidents the previous week, to 38 in the following. Of the 38 anti-Muslim hate incidents, 22 were directed at Muslim women who wore the niqab, or face veil. The group recorded a total of 57 incidents in the three weeks following the publication of the column by the former foreign secretary and current prime minister, 32 of which were directed at Muslim women. It said that between 5 and 29 August, 42% of the street-based incidents reported to Tell Mama directly referenced Johnson and the language used in his column. Johnson was widely criticised by senior Tories after making the remarks, with demands for an apology from the then party chairman, Brandon Lewis. In the article in question, Johnson had said he felt \u201cfully entitled\u201d to expect women to remove face coverings when talking to him at his MP\u2019s surgery. He also said schools and universities should be able to take the same approach if a student \u201cturns up \u2026 looking like a bank robber\u201d. Johnson had called the burqa \u201coppressive\u201d, adding it was \u201cabsolutely ridiculous that people should choose to go around looking like letter boxes\u201d. Johnson was subsequently investigated over the comments by an independent panel and was cleared of breaking the Conservative party\u2019s code of conduct. The investigation into whether he broke party rules was triggered automatically after the receipt of a number of complaints over the column. A spokesperson for Tell Mama said: \u201cThe rising instances of discrimination, hate speech, and anti-Muslim literature indicate that a more general intolerance and hatred is growing. These typologies are seldom prosecutable by law and have proven more difficult to achieve satisfactory outcomes and solutions for victims. \u201cSimilarly, this year we analysed the trends in verbal abuse, finding a common theme whereby perpetrators use language attacking Islam and religious practices alongside, for example, anti-Muslim hate incidents that range from abusive behaviour, discrimination, or threats. \u201cWe therefore emphasise the gravity of attacks on Islam in tandem with hatred directed at individuals or institutions. The two are interconnected, thus hatred and intolerance must both be challenged simultaneously.\u201d In total Tell Mama recorded 1,072 verified anti-Muslim or Islamophobic reports. Of the 1,072 cases, 745 occurred at a street level and 327 were online. Over the three years to 2018, the group said it recorded a steady annual increase in street-based anti-Muslim incidents. However, this year demonstrated an 11% reduction in street-based incidents compared with 2017. The group added it should be noted that there were four major terrorist attacks in the UK in 2017, which led to sharp spikes of reported anti-Muslim hate incidents. In 2018 anti-Muslim attacks and incidents most commonly took place in public areas. Incidents which took place within the victim\u2019s household or private property increased by 11%, and those at the victim\u2019s place of work rose by 8% since the previous year. Consistent with previous reports, the majority of victims were female at 57% and the main perpetrators were male. Iman Atta, the director of Tell Mama, said: \u201cWe are in a period of instability, politically and socially. Even in 2018, when there were no major terrorist attacks in comparison to 2017, when there were four of them in the United Kingdom, levels of anti-Muslim hatred or Islamophobia have remained stubbornly high. In fact, levels in 2018 equalled those of 2017 when the major terrorist attacks took place. \u201cAnti-Muslim hatred has become an issue that is not going away and which has been growing since we started supporting victims of anti-Muslim hate in 2011. We ask all politicians to reflect on the future of our country.\u201d",

A school is forced to become an academy if it is \u201celigible for intervention\u201d under law. The order is triggered by a school being classed as inadequate by Ofsted. Previously it could also be triggered by poor performances in exams but that condition was dropped by the education secretary, Damian Hinds, in 2018.</p>\n    <p><b>Do parents get any say in the matter?</b></p>\n    <p>No. Governing bodies, parents and councils get no input in the DfE\u2019s intervention to force academisation. They also have no say in which trust the school is forced to join, meaning the chain may be based hundreds of miles away. Critics say this is a derogation of local democracy.</p>\n    <p><b>What happens to the school?</b></p>\n    <p>The school\u2019s legal relationship becomes a contract between the trust that manages it and the DfE, cutting ties with local authorities. The school\u2019s land and buildings are effectively leased to the trust. Head teachers are stripped of their autonomy, with budget and staffing decisions made by the trust. In most cases the school\u2019s existing leadership is dismissed. The school\u2019s governors lose legal responsibilities, and there is no requirement for trusts to consult with parents. Often the school is renamed and a new uniform adopted. The trust retains a proportion of the school\u2019s funding for its administration and executive costs.</p>\n    <p><b>Does forced academisation improve schools?</b></p>\n    <p>There is little evidence either way. Previously, three-quarters of schools rated as inadequate by Ofsted later improved without forced academisation. The National Audit Office has concluded there is a lack of capable Mats able to improve schools in difficulty.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The increased pay and pension contributions form part of the \u00a314bn in education spending announced by Williamson and Boris Johnson last week, with most of the increase directed towards core school funding.</p> \n<p>But <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/boris-johnsons-schools-cash-boost-favours-tory-constituencies-rrrj5swbv\">analysis by the Sunday Times</a> suggests the bulk of the new money will overwhelmingly benefit schools in the constituencies of Conservative MPs, while those in deprived areas of London and the north of England will see little improvement.

      "bodyText": "UK house prices could crash by as much as a fifth if Boris Johnson pursues a no-deal Brexit, and the biggest falls would be in London and Northern Ireland, a leading accountancy firm has said. Reflecting the potentially vulnerable state of the property market as Brexit looms, KPMG said house prices would fall by between 5.4% and 7.5% across different regions next year if a new agreement with Brussels was not in place by 31 October. The analysis of average house prices across the country showed no deal could trigger a nationwide decline of about 6% in 2020 and that and a drop of between 10 and 20% was \u201cnot out of the question\u201d if the market reacted more strongly than expected. House price growth across Britain has slumped since the EU referendum three years ago, and prices fell across the south of England in August for the first time since the last recession in 2009. Property had become increasingly unaffordable for rising numbers of buyers in recent years, but Brexit uncertainty has served as a brake on the property market as buyers and sellers await greater political clarity. Although the slowdown has been good news for first-time buyers, as house prices gradually become more affordable,buyers and sellers have been spooked, leading to a reduction in transactions. \u201cBuyers are taking a cautious approach to purchasing decisions, with many opting to wait for a resolution to the Brexit saga,\u201d KPMG said. Average prices across the country rose by 0.9% in the year to June, according to official figures, the weakest national growth rate since 2012. The average UK house price was \u00a3230,000 in June, about \u00a32,000 higher than a year ago. Assessing the impact of a no-deal Brexit on local economies, KPMG said house prices in Northern Ireland and London could fall by as much as 7.5% and 7% respectively, because of their greater connectivity with EU trade. Despite the value of the average home in the capital potentially falling to \u00a3422,000 next year as a result of no-deal Brexit \u2013 down from \u00a3453,000 if an agreement is reached \u2013 KPMG said it would still have the highest cash prices in the country. The impact of a no-deal scenario would be least felt on the property markets in Wales and the east Midlands, where prices could drop by as much as 5.4% in 2020. Jan Crosby, the UK head of housing at KPMG, said Britain leaving without a deal would probably lead to a sharp drop in sales volumes as wary homeowners wait for the turbulence in the property market to clear. This in turn would \u201cmake government housing delivery targets impossible to achieve and slow new building across the sector\u201d, he said. Against a backdrop of falling owner occupation in Britain as first-time buyers find it difficult to get on the housing ladder, the government has promised to deliver 300,000 homes a year by the mid 2020s. Should Johnson strike an agreement to leave the EU with a deal on 31 October, KPMG suggested house prices would continue to rise next year, growing by about 1.3%.

      "body": "<p>At least 115,000 cancer patients in England are diagnosed at an advanced stage each year, too late to have the best chance of survival, say experts.</p> <p>Efforts to improve people\u2019s chances, by spotting tumours early on when they can be more easily treated, are being hampered by a chronic lack of skilled diagnostic staff, says Cancer Research UK.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/aug/12/charity-highlights-worrying-failure-to-improve-cancer-survival-in-england\">Charity highlights 'worrying' failure to improve cancer survival in England</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The charity\u2019s experts estimate that about 115,000 people who get cancer are already at stage 3 when it is detected, where the cancer may have started to spread, or stage 4, where it has reached other organs and is known as secondary or metastatic cancer. About 67,000 are diagnosed with stage 4 each year and their treatment options are much fewer.</p> <p>CRUK says the numbers may be even higher because there is no record made of the stage at which 19% of more than 300,000 new cancer patients a year are diagnosed in England.</p> <p>The government\u2019s long-term plan for the NHS sets an ambitious target of three quarters of cancers to be picked up early by 2028 \u2013 at stages 1 and 2 when a cure is more likely. By that time, there will be an estimated 320,000 cancers, so at least 100,000 more will have to be caught early to hit the target.</p> <p>But, says CRUK, that is impossible without more staff. One in 10 diagnostic posts are vacant. \u201cIt\u2019s unacceptable that so many people are diagnosed late. Although survival has improved, it\u2019s not happening fast enough,\u201d said Emma Greenwood, director of policy.</p> <p>\u201cMore referrals to hospital means we urgently need more staff. The government\u2019s inaction on staff shortages is crippling the NHS, failing cancer patients and the doctors and nurses who are working tirelessly to diagnose and treat them.</p> <p>\u201cBy 2035, one person every minute will be diagnosed with cancer but there\u2019s no plan to increase the number of NHS staff to cope with demand now or the growing numbers in the future. Saving lives from cancer needs to be top of the agenda for the new government and it must commit to investing in vital NHS staff now to ensure no one dies from cancer unnecessarily.\u201d</p> <p>There are a number of reasons why cancers are advanced by the time people are diagnosed. Many people in the UK ignore their symptoms. \u201cWhen we looked at international studies, they showed the British are somewhat peculiar compared with other populations in similar countries around the world in that we don\u2019t want to bother the doctor. In great part it has to do with not wanting to waste the doctor\u2019s time,\u201d said Sara Hiom of CRUK.</p> <p>But that reluctance, responsible for up to one in four delays according to an audit last year, is fed by an awareness that the NHS is struggling to cope and does not have enough staff, she said.</p> <p>Innovations in testing and treatment which have been introduced in other countries are being held up in the UK by staff shortages, she added. These include scans for lung cancer and diagnostic tests for bowel cancer.</p> <p>By 2027, the NHS in England needs an extra 1,700 radiologists \u2013 people who report on imaging scans \u2013 increasing the total number to nearly 4,800; to triple oncologists who treat cancer from 1,155 to 3,000; and to recruit 2,000 more therapeutic radiographers, says CRUK.</p> <p>The radiology expert Dr Giles Maskell said they could feel the bottleneck tightening as the number of patients diagnosed with cancer mounted in line with the ageing population. \u201cExtra scanners are welcome, but they will achieve nothing without staff to run them and experts to interpret the scans. It\u2019s like buying a fleet of planes with no pilots to fly them,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Trusts are working hard to meet cancer waiting time targets, said NHS Providers which represents them, but rising numbers of cancer patients, inability to invest in new machines and severe workforce shortages, particularly for endoscopists and radiologists, were all contributing to delays.</p> <p>The shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, blamed the government. \u201cThe stress and anxiety a patient facing cancer goes through is immense and these figures are a reminder that years of Tory cutbacks and understaffing has left patients not being seen on time, or waiting longer increasingly worried for test results,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cEarly diagnosis leads to better outcomes and so the government must urgently bring forward a fully funded staffing plan for our NHS.\u201d</p> <p>Breast cancer charities said the delays were deeply concerning. <strong>\u201c</strong>While more women are surviving breast cancer than ever before, there is unfortunately a stark difference in survival rates when women are diagnosed at a later stage, and we need to act now,\u201d said Gunes Kalkan of Breast Cancer Care and Breast Cancer Now.</p> <p>The Department of Health and Social Care said: \u201cCancer is a priority for this government. Survival rates are at a record high and, in the NHS long-term plan, we committed to detecting three quarters of all cancers at an early stage by 2028.</p> <p>\u201cWe now have over 900 more diagnostic radiographers working in the NHS when compared with 2017, and the record \u00a333.9bn extra we\u2019re investing in our NHS every year will ensure we can support the health service with the staff it needs for the future.\u201d<br></p>",

      "bodyText": "At least 115,000 cancer patients in England are diagnosed at an advanced stage each year, too late to have the best chance of survival, say experts. Efforts to improve people\u2019s chances, by spotting tumours early on when they can be more easily treated, are being hampered by a chronic lack of skilled diagnostic staff, says Cancer Research UK. The charity\u2019s experts estimate that about 115,000 people who get cancer are already at stage 3 when it is detected, where the cancer may have started to spread, or stage 4, where it has reached other organs and is known as secondary or metastatic cancer. About 67,000 are diagnosed with stage 4 each year and their treatment options are much fewer. CRUK says the numbers may be even higher because there is no record made of the stage at which 19% of more than 300,000 new cancer patients a year are diagnosed in England. The government\u2019s long-term plan for the NHS sets an ambitious target of three quarters of cancers to be picked up early by 2028 \u2013 at stages 1 and 2 when a cure is more likely. By that time, there will be an estimated 320,000 cancers, so at least 100,000 more will have to be caught early to hit the target. But, says CRUK, that is impossible without more staff. One in 10 diagnostic posts are vacant. \u201cIt\u2019s unacceptable that so many people are diagnosed late. Although survival has improved, it\u2019s not happening fast enough,\u201d said Emma Greenwood, director of policy. \u201cMore referrals to hospital means we urgently need more staff. The government\u2019s inaction on staff shortages is crippling the NHS, failing cancer patients and the doctors and nurses who are working tirelessly to diagnose and treat them. \u201cBy 2035, one person every minute will be diagnosed with cancer but there\u2019s no plan to increase the number of NHS staff to cope with demand now or the growing numbers in the future. Saving lives from cancer needs to be top of the agenda for the new government and it must commit to investing in vital NHS staff now to ensure no one dies from cancer unnecessarily.\u201d There are a number of reasons why cancers are advanced by the time people are diagnosed. Many people in the UK ignore their symptoms. \u201cWhen we looked at international studies, they showed the British are somewhat peculiar compared with other populations in similar countries around the world in that we don\u2019t want to bother the doctor. In great part it has to do with not wanting to waste the doctor\u2019s time,\u201d said Sara Hiom of CRUK. But that reluctance, responsible for up to one in four delays according to an audit last year, is fed by an awareness that the NHS is struggling to cope and does not have enough staff, she said. Innovations in testing and treatment which have been introduced in other countries are being held up in the UK by staff shortages, she added. These include scans for lung cancer and diagnostic tests for bowel cancer. By 2027, the NHS in England needs an extra 1,700 radiologists \u2013 people who report on imaging scans \u2013 increasing the total number to nearly 4,800; to triple oncologists who treat cancer from 1,155 to 3,000; and to recruit 2,000 more therapeutic radiographers, says CRUK. The radiology expert Dr Giles Maskell said they could feel the bottleneck tightening as the number of patients diagnosed with cancer mounted in line with the ageing population. \u201cExtra scanners are welcome, but they will achieve nothing without staff to run them and experts to interpret the scans. It\u2019s like buying a fleet of planes with no pilots to fly them,\u201d he said. Trusts are working hard to meet cancer waiting time targets, said NHS Providers which represents them, but rising numbers of cancer patients, inability to invest in new machines and severe workforce shortages, particularly for endoscopists and radiologists, were all contributing to delays. The shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, blamed the government. \u201cThe stress and anxiety a patient facing cancer goes through is immense and these figures are a reminder that years of Tory cutbacks and understaffing has left patients not being seen on time, or waiting longer increasingly worried for test results,\u201d he said. \u201cEarly diagnosis leads to better outcomes and so the government must urgently bring forward a fully funded staffing plan for our NHS.\u201d Breast cancer charities said the delays were deeply concerning. \u201cWhile more women are surviving breast cancer than ever before, there is unfortunately a stark difference in survival rates when women are diagnosed at a later stage, and we need to act now,\u201d said Gunes Kalkan of Breast Cancer Care and Breast Cancer Now. The Department of Health and Social Care said: \u201cCancer is a priority for this government. Survival rates are at a record high and, in the NHS long-term plan, we committed to detecting three quarters of all cancers at an early stage by 2028. \u201cWe now have over 900 more diagnostic radiographers working in the NHS when compared with 2017, and the record \u00a333.9bn extra we\u2019re investing in our NHS every year will ensure we can support the health service with the staff it needs for the future.\u201d",

Ho said she expected the crisis to escalate in the lead-up to celebrations on 1 October to mark the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China in 1949. \u201cWhat will happen during this month, nobody will really answer this question,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat we can really do in this moment is become more united in this fight and become really strategic in the face of this huge machine that is the [Chinese] communist government.\u201d She said six young people had killed themselves \u201cbecause of despair\u201d during the protest period. \u201cI really want the world to know that although we are seeing a lot of violence from all sides at this moment, this really started out as a largely peaceful protest in June,\u201d she said. \u201cWe tried all sorts of ways to get our voices heard, to get to the government. But they only responded with teargas, more teargas, rubber bullets, sponge bullets, police brutality.\u201d",

But the last three, we need to learn to win games like this, and the boys want to learn how.\u201d Harry Maguire concurred with Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s sentiments regarding ruthlessness and the centre-back said he and his teammates also need to develop a healthy arrogance. \u201cI feel like we\u2019ve been fairly solid defensively but the fine margins are the set\u2011plays and they\u2019re punishing us at the moment and we\u2019re not being clinical at the other end,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were too sloppy and we need to improve on that and show arrogance on the ball and be confident on the ball. \u201cWe\u2019re Man Utd and we want to control games and I feel like the last 20 [minutes] of the first [half] and the first 20 of the second we didn\u2019t really control the game and I think we got punished for that. \u201d",

Do not read on unless you have watched the season three finale.</em></p> <p>When Mayday was introduced in season one, it was a shady resistance June wanted to turn to for help. We glimpsed only the skinniest branches of the organisation and assumed that there was some central hub somewhere, a powerful figure running the show. But in this season three finale, we learn that Mayday isn\u2019t some grand plan or a hierarchy of rebels \u2013 it\u2019s anyone who wants to damage Gilead. Right now, Mayday is a handmaid and two Marthas in Commander Lawrence\u2019s kitchen. June has become Mayday \u2013 and suddenly the show\u2019s decision to name \u2018Offred\u2019 June feels a wee bit on the nose.</p> <p>Within moments, June has resorted to keeping her plan to rescue 52 children on track with the gun that\u2019s been waiting patiently to become a plot point since episode 11. She\u2019s convinced that ruthlessness is how the men of Gilead won, and that victory goes not to who is right, but to whoever has the hardest heart. These days June\u2019s heart is hard enough to threaten a frightened child with a gun, and stand firm against Lawrence\u2019s final spasms of fragile masculinity (\u201cYou\u2019re still in my house, young lady!\u201d). She still believes all her suffering and all her crimes must amount to something, even if Lawrence insists that \u201cthe universe doesn\u2019t have a balance sheet\u201d. She\u2019s going to rescue those kids if it kills her and everyone else involved in the plan \u2013 including Rita and Janine.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2f1b346629781924bc6c9901954d82c59cdd4b7f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f1b346629781924bc6c9901954d82c59cdd4b7f/0_200_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"June is going to rescue those kids if it kills her and everyone else \u2013 including Rita and Janine.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">June is going to rescue those kids if it kills her and everyone else \u2013 including Rita and Janine.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jasper Savage/Hulu</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Their route to the airport intentionally mirrors the woods in which June had Hannah torn from her arms. This time, she is determined not to be helpless, and no one will stop these children from reaching safety, especially not one solitary Eye guarding the airport. That\u2019s when June realises it won\u2019t be her ruthlessness that saves the day \u2013 it will be her selflessness. Her drive to hurt Gilead may have begun as revenge, but here we see her realise a greater purpose: she wants to save anyone in danger in Gilead. She wants to bring the whole thing down, and she will give her life to do so \u2013 which, for as long as she is alive at least, makes her unstoppable.</p> <p>This leads to a rather contrived scene where Janine and a group of Marthas join June in her heroic last stand and throw a bunch of rocks at the Eye, when June could surely have just shot him. But we\u2019ll let the show get away with it, for the image of women standing together in the face of oppression is a powerful one. Better still was June\u2019s handmaid friends searching the woods for her after she is shot and carrying her to safety, walking in their customary two-by-two formation, with a gravely injured insurrectionist held between them. The Martha network has done their bit \u2013 season four is surely time for the handmaid network to rise, as June vows to lead \u2018her people\u2019 to the land of milk and honey (or, well, Canada). Season three has now truly turned June into a freedom fighter, and it\u2019ll be fascinating to see just how far she will be go in the fight against Gilead.</p> <h2><strong>Canada</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ce0b13124b5e175a93a346e5168cb77a6635e263\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ce0b13124b5e175a93a346e5168cb77a6635e263/0_160_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The most uplifting moment of all ...

      "body": "<p><strong> </strong>A very happy 45<sup>th</sup> birthday to Ms Polly Gray, who decided to mark it as only Aunt Pol can by threatening a nun with a hatpin, busting a former lover hellbent on revenge out of hospital, and debating freedom with her son\u2019s new wife (not entirely successfully, it should be noted).</p> <p>Elsewhere, things were getting pretty complicated for the Shelby family, who continue to collect enemies in much the same way 10-year-olds do Match Attax. While Arthur struggled with the monster within (and there\u2019s surely a special place in hell for those who sully a Friends Meeting House with violence), Tommy\u2019s paranoia is reaching new heights. He\u2019s been unnerved in the past but he\u2019s usually far better at hiding it. It was also notable that he had to get drunk before facing Jessie Eden (to some extent his conscience) and letting her know that he wouldn\u2019t speak out against Oswald Mosley.</p> <h2><strong>Our heroes</strong></h2> <p>The realities of being a Peaky wife were very much the main theme of a nicely paced episode, with Linda, Lizzie and Gina all coming to different conclusions about the best way to survive gang life.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"49edb15707fa4f00c281df2790dd8aa38e207df7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/49edb15707fa4f00c281df2790dd8aa38e207df7/0_109_4285_2572/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Polly Gray (Helen McCrory)\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Happy birthday, Polly Gray (Helen McCrory).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Squire/BBC/Caryn Mandabach Productions Ltd 2019</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For Gina it\u2019s simple: she\u2019s an American, her child will be born in the US and a besotted Michael will fall in line to help her. Yet, given her husband\u2019s increasingly precarious role within the company (and his refusal to simply keep his head down until the distrust passes), how easy is her planned escape route likely to be?</p> <p>Linda\u2019s story demonstrated how hard it is to actually cut those ties \u2013 although some might doubt the wisdom of letting it be known that you\u2019d already moved on from your ex-husband with a kinder man. That said, I found Linda\u2019s examination of the person she wants to be and the person she is with Arthur to be compelling, particularly because Arthur himself claimed he was a good man even as he beat a man possibly to death. Will Linda return to the Shelby fold following that act of violence?

      "bodyText": "A very happy 45th birthday to Ms Polly Gray, who decided to mark it as only Aunt Pol can by threatening a nun with a hatpin, busting a former lover hellbent on revenge out of hospital, and debating freedom with her son\u2019s new wife (not entirely successfully, it should be noted). Elsewhere, things were getting pretty complicated for the Shelby family, who continue to collect enemies in much the same way 10-year-olds do Match Attax. While Arthur struggled with the monster within (and there\u2019s surely a special place in hell for those who sully a Friends Meeting House with violence), Tommy\u2019s paranoia is reaching new heights. He\u2019s been unnerved in the past but he\u2019s usually far better at hiding it. It was also notable that he had to get drunk before facing Jessie Eden (to some extent his conscience) and letting her know that he wouldn\u2019t speak out against Oswald Mosley. Our heroes The realities of being a Peaky wife were very much the main theme of a nicely paced episode, with Linda, Lizzie and Gina all coming to different conclusions about the best way to survive gang life. For Gina it\u2019s simple: she\u2019s an American, her child will be born in the US and a besotted Michael will fall in line to help her. Yet, given her husband\u2019s increasingly precarious role within the company (and his refusal to simply keep his head down until the distrust passes), how easy is her planned escape route likely to be? Linda\u2019s story demonstrated how hard it is to actually cut those ties \u2013 although some might doubt the wisdom of letting it be known that you\u2019d already moved on from your ex-husband with a kinder man. That said, I found Linda\u2019s examination of the person she wants to be and the person she is with Arthur to be compelling, particularly because Arthur himself claimed he was a good man even as he beat a man possibly to death. Will Linda return to the Shelby fold following that act of violence? I imagine that any reunion will be heavily propped up by drink and drugs. Lizzie, meanwhile, had arguably the most interesting trajectory of all as she made her peace both with her relationship with Tommy and her role within the family. \u201cI used to sleep with seven men a night and now I\u2019m learning to ride side-saddle,\u201d was an entertainingly blunt way to put it, but I think Lizzie has always been a pragmatist at heart and her decision to get the best out of a difficult situation was very much in character. And while the whole \u201cproperty\u201d bedroom talk had queasy undertones, it\u2019s probably also worth noting that Lizzie is the only one of Tommy\u2019s women who has never tried to change him. She walks her own path as much as she can. As she told Linda: \u201cI chose this life. It didn\u2019t choose me.\u201d The bad guys It\u2019s a recurring theme in Peaky Blinders that Tommy will always appear to overreach himself at one point in each series \u2013 and that definitely seems the case with his plan to infiltrate Mosley\u2019s new political party and undermine it from within. For starters, Mosley is clearly prepared enough to know both about the existence of Ben Younger and about Tommy\u2019s relationship to him. Plus, there\u2019s also the question of how ready Younger is to step in. For all that he\u2019s given his backing to Tommy\u2019s plan, he did stress that he still answers to higher powers, and those higher powers are clearly more than chummy with Mosley. If dealing with Mosley was tricky enough \u2013 and I think it is tricky because this is a man with the weight of the establishment behind him and all the carelessness of those who see themselves as born to rule \u2013 Tommy has an additional, more overtly violent, front to fight with the Billy Boys. As expected, Aberama Gold remains hellbent on retribution and not afraid to use extreme methods to achieve said revenge, even if his desire to deliver the final bullet saw him listen to Arthur for now. The trouble is that everything we\u2019ve seen of Billy Boys leader Jimmy suggests that he\u2019s a man who loves the thrill of a turf war. Things are going to continue to be very dirty indeed. Notes from the boardroom Given that one of the main themes of this show is the innocent bystanders who pay the price for Peaky actions, I presume that the man Arthur attacked may not be the same man that Linda is seeing. Hurray, we spent more time with Karl. Boo, he\u2019s a budding racist. Oh, Peaky Blinders, why when you give do you just as swiftly take away? More seriously, the show could have fun with the notion that the child of former communist Ada holds very different views. Why is it that TV shows always choose to depict Glaswegians as speaking in a particularly convoluted and florid way? It\u2019s as though the only Scot they have ever heard speak is the sainted Sir Billy. I remain intrigued by Gina\u2019s ultimate game \u2013 and also will be quite disappointed if her Statue of Liberty gift doesn\u2019t serve some kind of Chekovian purpose by the series end. Congratulations to everyone below the line who called it that the Peaky Blinders weren\u2019t behind the assassination of the unfortunate journalist. Nice work, all of you (and I presume it\u2019s Mosley who did the dirty deed). I was pleased to get confirmation during the pheasant shoot that Tommy served in the cavalry, so Ben Younger was indeed his commanding officer. Lizzie\u2019s wardrobe is giving me extreme envy. The wages of sin is clearly good fashion sense. So Johnny is something of a dirty dog on the sly then\u2026 Nice to see the always excellent Kate Dickie pop up briefly as the unpleasant Mother Superior in the opening scenes. Anachronistic yet strangely right song of the week While I\u2019m a big fan of The Pearl Harts\u2019 Black Blood, this can only go to Anna Calvi\u2019s haunting cover of David Bowie\u2019s Lady Grinning Soul, which played as Arthur gave in to his darker self. Quote of the week \u201cFor fuck\u2019s sake, the Furys don\u2019t even use words to fucking talk, just hand gestures and fucking howls,\u201d Johnny Dogs lays it on the line with a very cheeky quote that will have tickled fans of boxing and Love Island. So what did you think? Can Tommy see off all of his many enemies? Will Polly leave with Gina and Michael for the hallowed shores of Long Island? And which of Lizzie\u2019s many excellent outfits would you most like to wear \u2026 As always all speculation and no spoilers welcome below.",

Almost a quarter of the current cabinet have voted against the party whip. But this is about the national interest, and we\u2019ve moved beyond the point where threats will persuade people to abandon their principles.\u201d</p> \n<p>The suggestion by Gove that the government could defy the law also sparked fury from MPs, including one former Tory minister who said it showed democracy was under threat from Johnson\u2019s government.</p> \n<p>One source close to the group of ex-ministers said Gove\u2019s comments underlined the urgency of passing the bill this week, to allow time for legal action if the government rejected the new law or if Johnson refused to follow its direction to seek an extension to the Brexit deadline.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis legislation will need to be taken to the courts if the government decides not to abide by it,\u201d a senior source close to the Conservative rebels said. \u201cThat is precisely why we have to act next week. In October, we will not have enough time. It is literally now or never.\u201d</p> \n<p>A bill which would mandate another extension of article 50 has been drafted which senior sources said would go into more detail about the length of an extension \u2013 unlike the previous law passed by Yvette Cooper and Oliver Letwin which did not specify a timeframe.</p> \n<p>Letwin is expected to lead the bill\u2019s presentation, though the effort has been closely coordinated with the shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer and the Labour frontbench. On Tuesday, MPs are expected to immediately ask the Commons Speaker, John Bercow, for an emergency debate under the standing order 24 rule, debates which traditionally end with a neutral motion.</p> \n<p>However, rebels hope the Speaker will allow a vote on a motion to set aside Wednesday for MPs to take control of the Commons order paper to pass a bill through all stages in the Commons.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/01/unite-will-support-labour-mps-who-vote-for-a-new-brexit-deal\">Corbyn</a> will convene a meeting of the shadow cabinet on Monday to outline the plans, saying Labour will do \u201ceverything necessary to pull our country back from the brink\u201d.</p> \n<p>Starmer said the bill would be \u201ca very short, simple exercise designed to ensure we don\u2019t crash out without a deal,\u201d saying the length of an extension was a \u201csecondary\u201d concern.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt will be as simple as it possibly can be,\u201d said one source close to the cross-party talks. \u201cThat is the only way to keep the coalition together.\u201d</p> \n<p>In an interview with the BBC, Gove repeatedly refused to rule out the possibility that the government could ignore any law passed by parliament to stop a no-deal Brexit. \u201cLet\u2019s see what the legislation says,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re asking me about a pig in a poke.\u201d</p> \n<p>Starmer called for Johnson to make an urgent statement on Gove\u2019s comments. \u201cFor ministers not to confirm that this government will accept and comply with legislation lawfully passed is breathtaking,\u201d he tweeted.</p> \n<p>The Conservative MP Guto Bebb, a supporter of the People\u2019s Vote campaign for a second referendum, said Gove had shown the \u201cour very democracy is now under threat from Boris Johnson and his government\u201d.</p> \n<p>MPs who have been now been denied the meeting with Johnson said they had planned to challenge the prime minister on the need to devise a concrete proposal for a new deal and demanded a positive reaction from the EU in order to be convinced of Johnson\u2019s sincerity.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe are now less than three weeks away from the 30-day deadline for an alternative to the backstop,\u201d said a source close to the group. \u201cThis is a group who are all reconciled that the best outcome is a Brexit deal. They genuinely want to see helpful signs \u2013 so is the prime minister able to give them new, concrete evidence that a deal is in play?\u201d</p> \n<p>Speaking on Sky News, Gauke said he hoped that Johnson would not follow through with threats to withdraw the whip but suggested it would not change his mind.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/01/get-ready-for-brexit-government-launches-information-blitz\">\u2018Get Ready for Brexit\u2019: government launches information blitz</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cSometimes there is a point where ... you have to judge between your own personal interests and the national interest.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson is prepared to blow up his own parliamentary majority and withdraw the whip from dozens of Conservative MPs if they back plans to stop no-deal Brexit, Tory whips have warned potential rebels, in an extreme move by Downing Street that would pave the way for an imminent general election. As hostilities escalated, Johnson also signalled how serious his intention is to follow through the threat of deselection by abruptly ripping up plans for a meeting with rebellious former ministers, including Philip Hammond and David Gauke, that had been billed as a last-ditch effort to limit support for the action in parliament. Hammond was offered a one-to-one meeting with the prime minister which he declined, calling it \u201cdiscourteous\u201d to cancel on the group. \u201cThere has been very little attempt at engagement with us, but these people were going in seeking proof of genuine attempts to get a Brexit deal,\u201d one source close to the MPs said. \u201cThe fact it had been cancelled at short notice suggests there isn\u2019t a proper negotiation going on. The next point of engagement will be in the voting lobbies.\u201d The former cabinet ministers supporting a cross-party bid to stop no deal fought back on Sunday night, telling MPs they must be prepared to take the government to court if it defied any law passed by rebel MPs in parliament. The threat was prompted by a suggestion from Michael Gove that the government may not feel bound by the legislation. Ahead of a historic week in parliament, a fierce briefing war erupted across the Conservative party as whips convened for Sunday lunch with Johnson at the prime minister\u2019s country retreat at Chequers, agreeing that any Conservative MP who voted on the rebel legislation would have the whip withdrawn and become ineligible to stand for the party. \u201cThe whips are telling Conservative MPs today a very simple message \u2013 if they fail to vote with the government on Tuesday they will be destroying the government\u2019s negotiating position and handing control of parliament to Jeremy Corbyn,\u201d said a senior source in the whips\u2019 office source. \u201cAny Conservative MP who does this will have the whip withdrawn and will not stand as a Conservative candidate in an election.\u201d No 10 believes the nuclear threat of deselection, and its unprecedented consequence of removing the whip of a former chancellor and justice secretary just weeks after they left government, has a serious chance of spooking MPs and wiping the majority for any no-deal legislation in parliament. Government sources conceded that the practical reality of removing the whip from a significant number of MPs could inevitably lead to a general election. Should the government lose the support of the more than 20 MPs currently planning to vote against it, Johnson would find it impossible to manage in minority government. \u201cFor a government that has a majority of one which has repeatedly said it does not want an election, to then threaten to deselect 20 MPs, well it suggests that it is not the case,\u201d one prominent rebel said. The whips\u2019 office source said the seriousness of the threat was to underline that MPs would be deliberately scuppering the chance of a Brexit deal. \u201cThere is a chance of a deal on 17 October only because Brussels realises the prime minister is totally committed to leaving on 31 October,\u201d the source said. Ex-ministers, including Hammond and Gauke, voiced outrage at the threat, calling it hypocrisy that a cabinet with eight former rebels at its heart could then threaten MPs with deselection. A source close to the MPs under threat of deselection said they would not be deterred: \u201cThis is sheer hypocrisy. Almost a quarter of the current cabinet have voted against the party whip. But this is about the national interest, and we\u2019ve moved beyond the point where threats will persuade people to abandon their principles.\u201d The suggestion by Gove that the government could defy the law also sparked fury from MPs, including one former Tory minister who said it showed democracy was under threat from Johnson\u2019s government. One source close to the group of ex-ministers said Gove\u2019s comments underlined the urgency of passing the bill this week, to allow time for legal action if the government rejected the new law or if Johnson refused to follow its direction to seek an extension to the Brexit deadline. \u201cThis legislation will need to be taken to the courts if the government decides not to abide by it,\u201d a senior source close to the Conservative rebels said. \u201cThat is precisely why we have to act next week. In October, we will not have enough time. It is literally now or never.\u201d A bill which would mandate another extension of article 50 has been drafted which senior sources said would go into more detail about the length of an extension \u2013 unlike the previous law passed by Yvette Cooper and Oliver Letwin which did not specify a timeframe. Letwin is expected to lead the bill\u2019s presentation, though the effort has been closely coordinated with the shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer and the Labour frontbench. On Tuesday, MPs are expected to immediately ask the Commons Speaker, John Bercow, for an emergency debate under the standing order 24 rule, debates which traditionally end with a neutral motion. However, rebels hope the Speaker will allow a vote on a motion to set aside Wednesday for MPs to take control of the Commons order paper to pass a bill through all stages in the Commons. Corbyn will convene a meeting of the shadow cabinet on Monday to outline the plans, saying Labour will do \u201ceverything necessary to pull our country back from the brink\u201d. Starmer said the bill would be \u201ca very short, simple exercise designed to ensure we don\u2019t crash out without a deal,\u201d saying the length of an extension was a \u201csecondary\u201d concern. \u201cIt will be as simple as it possibly can be,\u201d said one source close to the cross-party talks. \u201cThat is the only way to keep the coalition together.\u201d In an interview with the BBC, Gove repeatedly refused to rule out the possibility that the government could ignore any law passed by parliament to stop a no-deal Brexit. \u201cLet\u2019s see what the legislation says,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re asking me about a pig in a poke.\u201d Starmer called for Johnson to make an urgent statement on Gove\u2019s comments. \u201cFor ministers not to confirm that this government will accept and comply with legislation lawfully passed is breathtaking,\u201d he tweeted. The Conservative MP Guto Bebb, a supporter of the People\u2019s Vote campaign for a second referendum, said Gove had shown the \u201cour very democracy is now under threat from Boris Johnson and his government\u201d. MPs who have been now been denied the meeting with Johnson said they had planned to challenge the prime minister on the need to devise a concrete proposal for a new deal and demanded a positive reaction from the EU in order to be convinced of Johnson\u2019s sincerity. \u201cWe are now less than three weeks away from the 30-day deadline for an alternative to the backstop,\u201d said a source close to the group. \u201cThis is a group who are all reconciled that the best outcome is a Brexit deal. They genuinely want to see helpful signs \u2013 so is the prime minister able to give them new, concrete evidence that a deal is in play?\u201d Speaking on Sky News, Gauke said he hoped that Johnson would not follow through with threats to withdraw the whip but suggested it would not change his mind. \u201cSometimes there is a point where ... you have to judge between your own personal interests and the national interest. And the national interest has to come first,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, I hope it doesn\u2019t come to that, and I hope cooler and calmer heads will look at this and think that trying to split the Conservative party in this way is not a sensible way forward for the Conservative party, or indeed for the country.\u201d Former Foreign Office minister Alistair Burt and former health minister Stephen Hammond \u2013 both of whom have made clear they will vote for measures to stop no deal \u2013 also voiced fury at the threat. Burt said he had \u201cloyally supported\u201d Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal agreement and voted three times to leave the EU, unlike members of the current cabinet like Jacob Rees-Mogg. \u201cWhy am I now being threatened and not them?\u201d he tweeted.",

Serena Williams takes on Petra Martic, the Croatian 22nd seed who upset the odds when she beat Anastasija Sevastova in straight sets in the previous round, and Novak Djokovic continues his title defence against Stan Wawrinka. World No 5 Elina Svitolina will also look to see off Madison Keys on home turf. </p> <p><strong>But that\u2019s all for later</strong>. First up Qiang Wang stands in the way of Ashleigh Barty\u2019s route to the last eight, while Johanna Konta, who has only once progressed past the fifth round here, will be taking on the No 3 seed Karolina Pliskova. And Roger Federer, who will be taking on David Goffin of Belgium and who has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/30/us-open-2019-roger-federer-dan-evans-tennis\">been rather chippy</a> of late. He breezed through his last match in the blink of an eye \u2013 well, an hour and 20 minutes \u2013 so should be fresh as a daisy for this one. Goffin has his work cut out.

      "bodyText": "And that\u2019s that from our live blog today. There will be a report to follow on Serena\u2019s win. Thanks for reading. Serena admits she was a little worried when that injury happened but says the crowd pulled her through to her 16th US Open quarter-final. \u201cAm I that old?\u201d she says when reminded of that. It\u2019s two years to the day that her daughter was born. \u201cShe sees me on TV and says \u2018Momma\u2019 and she sees Venus on the TV and says \u2018Momma\u2019. But that\u2019s OK, me and Venus share everything.\u201d She dedicates her win to all the parents out there. \u201cAs Billie-Jean King says, privilege is a pressure and I am privileged to have that pressure.\u201d Serena gets ready to serve for the second set and the match, and gets it done, just as would be expected. The injury does not appear to have dimmed Serena too much. At 4-2 up in the second, she forces another break point. Had she not overcooked a passing shot, she would be 5-2 up. No matter, she will serve the next. Here\u2019s Tumaini Carayol on Roger Federer\u2019s stroll. After lengthy treatment and strapping, along with something that looks like an ankle brace/support. Serena Williams, injury and all, battles to break Martic. Now the medical staff are coming on. Williams turns her ankle after landing following a volley. The video of it doesn\u2019t look good and she spends a moment or two on the floor but she gets back up. Williams and Martic is going with serve in the second set. Neither player looks to be giving an inch. Serena Williams won her first set against Martic 6-3. Dimitrov is through to the next round after a straight sets win over De Minaur. Konta thanks the crowd for some reason. Konta points out she is very happy, which is unsurprising. Points out she wants to go even further - and possibly win it. Now they cut to Tom Hiddleston, the real star of the show, before Konta whacks a few balls into the crowd. Konta is into the quarter finals after hold her nerve at Flushing Meadows. She looked remarkably calm in the latter stages and managed to get the job done. Pliskova cannot return the first serve but Konta gives her an opening with a wide forehand to level things up. She plays the same shot again but nails it into the corner. Konta hits a backhand into the net after a noise from the crowd upset her. It\u2019s not been a great crowd, that\u2019s for sure. A backhand slice from the baseline goes long to give Pliskova break point. It goes to deuce when Konta opens her body up to whack one into the corner. Pliskova whacks a return very long to give the Briton advantage. It\u2019s all square after a powerful forehand goes long from Konta. Pliskova gets moved all around the court by Konta who finishes it off with smash into space. Pliskova hits one long. KONTA WINS!! Serena Williams v Martic is going with serve. Currently 4-3 to the American in the opening set. Pliskova volleys a potential winner into the net, followed by a hilarious long shot, putting Konta 0:30 ahead. It gets worse with a double fault. Konta breaks!! She now gets to serve for the match. Konta does not show any nerves with an incredible backhand down the line which lands perfectly one the white paint. Konta is putting everything into her shots, there\u2019s no holding back as she smashes one into the corner, followed by an ace onto the line. Pliskova returns long, as Konta holds to love. All equal at 5-5. After losing the first two points, Konta gets back into the game with a forehand into the corner well out Pliskova\u2019s reach. She can\u2019t follow it up and sends a similar shot into the net. A powerful serve completes the win. Konta now needs to hold to save the game, as Pliskova leads 5-4. Both players are looking very confident on their own serve. Konta is putting Pliskova in trouble with some wide serving, who can\u2019t return with an composure. Konta takes the game. All square at 4-4. Konta gets Pliskova on the rack but then whacks a forehand into the net when a winner was on. Pliskova wins the game to love. Now 4-3 to the Czech. A very long rally comes to an end when Konta needlessly hits a smash into the net. She moves on quickly and breezes through the next few points to hold. Things are level at 3-3. Pliskova double faults to open up her service game. She makes up for it by taking the next two points untroubled, followed by an ace. It\u2019s 3-2 to the Czech in the final set. A rally from the back of the court ends with a cracking Pliskova backhand into space. Konta miscues a backhand slice and it loops very long to put her in further trouble. She rectifies that issue with an ace and the next serve puts Pliskova in trouble and Konta converts a poor return. Konta goes from 0:30 to winning the game. Great work from her to level the set at 2-2. A double fault from Pliskova gets Konta into the game at 15:15. Some ugly shots from both players result in Pliskova getting the next point as Konta sends the ball very wide but then the Czech hits one even wider to make it all square. Pliskova takes the game after Konta sends one long. A 2-1 lead in the final set for Pliskova. Konta starts off the next game with a lovely finisher after a poor backhand from Pliskova. A backhand slice from the baseline goes into the net for Konta to make it 30:30. Konta gets through the game to win it and level the final set at 1-1. Pliskova is not messing about in the final set. She wins her opening service game to love. Konta didn\u2019t get a sniff. Konta drops down to 15-30 on that vital service game, then to 15-40, when making a mess of an overhead. Then there\u2019s a gutsy serve, then a crashing volley to level the game. That\u2019s much better. Then she forces Pliskova into lobbing up the ball from the baseline and drills home a winner. Then an error from Pliskova. It\u2019s 1-1 on sets. Good stuff from the plucky Brit. And Konta breaks again! She is serving for the second set. Mind you, she was serving for the first set too. Serena is ready for her match, and against an unfamiliar opponent in the Croatian Petra Martic. She gets one heck of a whoop as she enters the Arthur Ashe. And Konta, just like she needed to, has broken back. She won\u2019t be going out without a fight. The problem being that she is much more vulnerable on her serve. Konta, though, holds her serve. Now to put the pressure on Pliskova. The match to be Federer\u2019s next victim, that between Grigor Dimitrov and Australia\u2019s Alex de Minaur is heading the way of the Bulgarian, who won the first set 7-5 and is 3-1 up in the second set. Konta\u2019s grand slam hopes are slipping away fast; she is 3-1 down in the second set and serving for her life. She holds her serve and badly needs a break back or it is curtains. It\u2019s almost Serena time, and the Arthur Ashe Stadium is ready for her, having just watched the Federer express make such short work of Goffin. Pliskova is in crushing form, and cruises to a 5-1 lead in the tie-break, and then makes short work of getting to seven and a 7-6 first set win. Konta let that slip, and very badly. Pliskova served eight aces to one, and that was where the set was eventually won. Konta in trouble, as she is overwhelmed by Pliskova, who wins nine points to her one to go 6-5 up. She needs to serve out the 12th game of the first set to reach a tiebreak. She manages it, and actually rather comfortably. That\u2019s his 56th quarter-final, his 13th at Flushing Meadows. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to see the joy but you need the success,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s easier when you don\u2019t play tennis and get your ass kicked every week.\u201d That was as easy a match as the old man could have envisaged. He will be well rested ahead of facing one of Dimitrov and De Minaur. A blow for Britain! Konta, with Pliskova having made short work of the ninth game to make it 4-5, really needs to hold. She goes 0-30 down, and then 0-40. Then loses the first break point. Oh dear. Federer is 5-0 up, and Goffin will have no need to book an extra night. This has been so easy for the Swiss master, as hard as Goffin has tried. Konta, at 4-3, really needs to hold her serve to see out the first set. And manages to do so. 5-3 up and looking set fair. And Federer cruises into a 2-0 lead in the third set. I know it\u2019s crazy, but it\u2019s true. He has won 9 points to Goffin\u2019s one. Federer, to nobody\u2019s surprise, wins the second set 6-2. It\u2019s 5-2 to Federer now. He fancies a quiet night in Manhattan, listening to the music of Christopher Cross. Federer is merciless as he breaks Goffin back immediately and goes 4-2 up in the second. Konta, having served well to go 3-1 up, gives herself a chance of a break in the next, and has three chances to do so. Then gets another on deuce, and then a fifth. That goes west and she eventually surrenders the chance to take full control, and then uses up a challenge. Pliskova struck back for 2-1 against Konta, and Federer was broken back by Goffin for 2-3 in the second set. It\u2019s all happening. And Federer has broken in the second against Goffin: 3-1. Pliskova starts the match horrendously, losing her service game without mustering so much as a point. Konta holds for 2-0. Federer takes the first set, 6-2, just as Konta and Pliskova trot out on to the Louis Armstrong court. Inevitably, Federer responded to the insult of losing an early service game by breaking back immediately \u2013 and then again. He now leads 4-2 in the first. A third match point for Wang is expertly dealt with by Barty \u2013 but then comes a fourth, and the Australian\u2019s return is low and long. And that\u2019s that: the No 2 seed is out, and has been quietly wretched today \u2013 but take nothing away from Wang who came out swinging from the first minute and put in a tremendous display. A career high. An early surprise on Arthur Ashe as Goffin breaks Federer in the first set: 2-1 A second match point comes and goes for Wang, before Barty thwacks her way to a precious point. That\u2019s 5-4 in the second, and Wang will serve for the match. \u2026but Barty keeps it alive, hitting the net twice with her serves but taking the point. Barty\u2019s 34th unforced error of the mach hands Wang match point! Federer and Goffin are under way on Arthur Ashe, and the Swiss has sauntered through his first service game. The best tennis of the match so far: a 22-stroke rally ends with Barty luring Wang to the net before drifting a delightful backhand over her shoulder. That takes her to break point, but Wang claws it backs. Finally, after the fourth deuce, Wang puts an epic game to bed. 4-4. Both players hold their next service games for 4-3, but Barty looks to have found her feet now and is playing with purpose. This match could be a corker. A flash of Barty brilliance arrives with a delicate lob that lands tantalisingly ahead of Wang before spinning away out of reach. And she follows it up with two aces. She\u2019s woken up. 3-2. Over on Arthur Ashe, Roger Federer is about to get going in his match against David Goffin. That\u2019ll be under way in five minutes. Back at Louis Armstrong, a rusty-looking Barty puts up little in the way of a fight in Wang\u2019s latest service game: 3-1 in the second. Wang breaks, and holds \u2013 a perfect forehand down the line taking her to advantage \u2013 for 2-0 in the second set. Glorious stuff from Wang, but Barty looks distinctly off-colour. She wipes her brow grimly \u2013 and promptly takes the first three points of her service game. And she starts the second set in similar fashion, lashing an unreturnable backhand over the net to take the first point of Barty\u2019s service game. First set Wang, 6-2. Another painful mistake from Barty, who sends a simple return badly long for set point. Wang takes the set with a crisp forehand. She\u2019s playing magnificently. And she holds for 5-1. No errors this time from Barty, who\u2019s doing her best to keep up but Wang is just too good for her right now. This is a supremely confident start from Wang, who has broken again to go 4-1 up in the first set. Barty loses her service game with a badly botched shot that flies into the crowd, and looks furious with herself. Wang responds with a strong service game of her own before going one better and breaking early for a 2-1 lead. She\u2019s showing some really assured tennis and this has the makings of a knife-edge contest. And Barty has hit her stride early, easing through her service game without dropping a point and sending Wang scampering back on forth in the process. And we\u2019re away, Barty serving first and taking the mach\u2019s first point with a lovely cross-court forehand. Ashleigh Barty and Wang Qiang are out on court at the Louis Armstrong Stadium, the game will be starting imminently. First, here\u2019s a little curtain-raiser: Today\u2019s other matches include Daniil Medvedev\u2019s meeting with Dominik Koepfer and Coco Gauff\u2019s doubles game, alongside Catherine McNally, against Nicole Melichar and Kveta Peschke. We\u2019ll be keeping you on top of all of it. In the meantime, here\u2019s what happened yesterday: After yesterday\u2019s japes at Flushing Meadows \u2013 Rafa Nadal swanning past Hyeon Chung and Caroline Wozniacki coming unstuck against 19-year-old Bianca Andreescu \u2013 today gives us another gaggle of heavyweights looking to secure their place in the quarter-finals. Serena Williams takes on Petra Martic, the Croatian 22nd seed who upset the odds when she beat Anastasija Sevastova in straight sets in the previous round, and Novak Djokovic continues his title defence against Stan Wawrinka. World No 5 Elina Svitolina will also look to see off Madison Keys on home turf. But that\u2019s all for later. First up Qiang Wang stands in the way of Ashleigh Barty\u2019s route to the last eight, while Johanna Konta, who has only once progressed past the fifth round here, will be taking on the No 3 seed Karolina Pliskova. And Roger Federer, who will be taking on David Goffin of Belgium and who has been rather chippy of late. He breezed through his last match in the blink of an eye \u2013 well, an hour and 20 minutes \u2013 so should be fresh as a daisy for this one. Goffin has his work cut out. Stay tuned.",

The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the \u00a339bn divorce payment.</p>\n    <p>The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods.</p>\n    <p>The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports \u2013 making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO \u201cmost favoured nation\u201d rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.<br></p>\n    <p>WTO rules only cover goods \u2013 they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK\u2019s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.<br></p>\n    <p>Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article 24 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to 10 years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article 24 unilaterally \u2013 the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK\u2019s trading relationship.<br></p>\n    <p>The director general of the WTO, Roberto Azev\u00eado, has <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/economics-and-finance/jumping-from-league-one-to-league-three-wto-insiders-scathing-assessments-of-a-wto-brexit\">told Prospect magazine</a> that \u201cin simple factual terms in this scenario, you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the UK and EU where currently there are none\u201d.</p>\n    <p>Until some agreements are in place, a no-deal scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses \u2013 eg the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europe after 31 October if there is no deal. Those arguing for a \u201cmanaged\u201d no deal envisage that a range of smaller, sector-by-sector, bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.</p>\n    <p><b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a></b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Theresa May had planned to end free movement through <a href=\"https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/home-affairs/immigration/the-immigration-bill-an-end-to-free-movement/\">the immigration bill</a>, but the proposed legislation, along with several other key new laws, have not made it through parliament because the Brexit crisis has choked the legislative process.</p> \n<p>Patel thought she could get around this using a so-called \u201cHenry VIII power\u201d but experts including Alexandra Sinclair, a fellow at the Public Law Project, <a href=\"https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/brexit/legislation/will-free-movement-end-from-31-october-2019/\">cited by House of Commons library researchers</a> in a report on the issue that any such move \u201cmight run into difficulties\u201d.</p> \n<p>The Institute for Government\u2019s programme director for Brexit, Joe Owen, said it would be \u201c<a href=\"https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/blog/governments-new-no-deal-brexit-immigration-plan-looks-undeliverable\">wide open to judicial review</a>\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cTo do that [end freedom of movement on 31 October] in any meaningful way would cause major disruption \u2013 employers, citizens and universities are completely unprepared for this last-minute U-turn,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cOn a practical level the plan is so close to impossible \u2013 if not entirely impossible \u2013 that one wonders whether the government is serious about making it work.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Sunday Times reported that the government\u2019s no-deal cabinet, known as the XO committee, was told last week that it would have a 70% chance of losing a court case, as the move gave no consideration to the pre-acquired rights of EU citizens.</p> \n<p>The shift in policy did not involve any assessment of how employers, landlords or Border Force officials would be able to distinguish between EU citizens already legally resident in the UK and those coming to the UK for the first time after a no-deal exit from the EU.</p> \n<p>In a statement which did not address points made by legal experts that free movement did not automatically end on 31 October, the Home Office said: \u201cFreedom of movement as it currently stands will end on 31 October when the UK leaves the EU, and after Brexit the government will introduce a new, fairer immigration system that prioritises skills and what people can contribute to the UK, rather than where they came from.\u201d<br></p>",

      "bodyText": "The government has been forced to scrap plans for a law that would end freedom of movement at midnight on 31 October in a no-deal scenario, according to reports. In a shift of policy, the home secretary, Priti Patel, had planned secondary legislation to stop freedom of movement for EU citizens into the UK, but has been forced to accept that the move could have landed the government in court. Her decision caused outrage when it was revealed last month, with the Liberal Democrats\u2019 Ed Davey branding her plan \u201ccompletely detached from reality \u2026 the next chapter in the never-ending saga of the utter mess they are making of Brexit\u201d. Free movement of EU citizens does not end automatically as a result of a no-deal Brexit, as EU law continues to apply until its legal foundation is repealed. Theresa May had planned to end free movement through the immigration bill, but the proposed legislation, along with several other key new laws, have not made it through parliament because the Brexit crisis has choked the legislative process. Patel thought she could get around this using a so-called \u201cHenry VIII power\u201d but experts including Alexandra Sinclair, a fellow at the Public Law Project, cited by House of Commons library researchers in a report on the issue that any such move \u201cmight run into difficulties\u201d. The Institute for Government\u2019s programme director for Brexit, Joe Owen, said it would be \u201cwide open to judicial review\u201d. \u201cTo do that [end freedom of movement on 31 October] in any meaningful way would cause major disruption \u2013 employers, citizens and universities are completely unprepared for this last-minute U-turn,\u201d he said. \u201cOn a practical level the plan is so close to impossible \u2013 if not entirely impossible \u2013 that one wonders whether the government is serious about making it work.\u201d The Sunday Times reported that the government\u2019s no-deal cabinet, known as the XO committee, was told last week that it would have a 70% chance of losing a court case, as the move gave no consideration to the pre-acquired rights of EU citizens. The shift in policy did not involve any assessment of how employers, landlords or Border Force officials would be able to distinguish between EU citizens already legally resident in the UK and those coming to the UK for the first time after a no-deal exit from the EU. In a statement which did not address points made by legal experts that free movement did not automatically end on 31 October, the Home Office said: \u201cFreedom of movement as it currently stands will end on 31 October when the UK leaves the EU, and after Brexit the government will introduce a new, fairer immigration system that prioritises skills and what people can contribute to the UK, rather than where they came from.\u201d",

Under a no-deal Brexit, all pension increases for British nationals in the EU were due to have stopped in March but the government has now said it will continue with the rises, in line with those given to retirees living in the UK, for the next three years. Campaigners for UK citizens resident in the EU have welcomed the three-year stay but say they are disappointed pensioners will be used for negotiations again three years down the line. \u201cThis commitment will come as a vital temporary relief to all pensioners living in the EU. We have been pressing for this step all year as, until today, those pensioners faced having their pensions frozen next April, on top of their pensions having lost over a fifth of their value because of the fall in the pound since before the referendum. But it does not go far enough,\u201d said Jeremy Morgan, a retired barrister living in Italy and vice-chair of the British in Europe Brexit campaign group. The work and pensions secretary, Amber Rudd, said the government was working hard to ensure Britain was \u201cleaving in a way that protects the interests of citizens here and in EU member states\u201d. She said: \u201cThis guarantee will provide reassurance to the hundreds of thousands of people living in the EU who receive a UK state pension that their pensions will continue to rise significantly each year, however we leave.\u201d Morgan said the UK is \u201calmost unique in the EU in distinguishing between pensioners who are living in the country and those that are not. \u201cIf you have worked all your life in the UK, it should be a basic entitlement and up to the individual to decide where they want to live without being penalised,\u201d he added. The government has previously expressed a desire to offer a lifetime guarantee on uprating, but only \u201csubject to reciprocity\u201d, a policy British in Europe has said is irrational. \u201cThese people paid their contributions and taxes to the UK, and then retired to the EU on the basis that their pension, already the lowest in the OECD countries, would at least be increased for inflation,\u201d said Morgan. \u201cTo move the goalposts for this vulnerable group when it is too late for them to do anything about it is simply immoral.\u201d He called on the government to review the decision urgently and offer the lifetime guarantee for their own citizens who had the \u201clegitimate expectation\u201d of an uprated pension when they moved to an EU country. British in Europe says some pensioners in rural France and in Spain are already struggling to make ends meet with the decrease in their pension seen since Brexit.",

      "bodyText": "The anti-immigration Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland party made strong gains in two crucial state elections in Germany on Sunday, increasing its support significantly but failing to oust the mainstream parties. But the sharp shift to the right in Saxony and Brandenburg \u2013 AfD came second in both states \u2013 is a blow to the ruling coalition of Angela Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats (CDU) and the Social Democrats (SPD), both parties having lost thousands of voters to AfD. The AfD was also able to mobilise several hundred thousand people who had never voted before, initial analysis showed. Exit polls showed the CDU remaining the strongest party in Saxony but losing more than six points to secure 33%, while AfD reached 28.1% \u2013 a gain of 18 percentage points, and a larger share of the vote than pollsters had predicted. In Brandenburg, the SPD, which has governed there since 1990, narrowly clung to first place, winning 26.6% and losing 5 points, while AfD secured 24.5%, a more than 10-point rise and a larger share than predicted. AfD\u2019s success in Saxony and Brandenburg, both in the former communist east, reflects the breakdown of support for Germany\u2019s mainstream parties, the centre-right CDU and the left-of-centre SPD and, as elsewhere in Europe, the increasing fragmentation of the political landscape. More than 5 million people were eligible to vote, about a 10th of the population. Turnout was significantly higher than at the last elections in the states in 2014 \u2013 up 12 points to 60% in Brandenburg, and up 16 points to 65% in Saxony \u2013 in what was billed a historic poll, AfD\u2019s first real electoral test in the region since it entered the national parliament as the leading opposition party two years ago. Formed in 2013 as an anti-euro party, its strength has grown on the back of its opposition to the arrival in Germany of almost 1 million refugees in 2015. It campaigned in Saxony and Brandenburg under the slogan \u201cVollende die Wende\u201d, or \u201ccomplete the transition\u201d \u2013 promising to rectify the mistakes of the mainstream parties after German reunification almost three decades ago and to address the inequalities between citizens of the former east and west. Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6cke, a leading AfD member based in the state of Thuringia, which votes on 27 October in what is expected to be another nail-biting election, said the polls offered \u201ca strong indication that we\u2019ll have a good future in Brandenburg and Saxony and in the whole of Germany\u201d.

Hornby, who stepped down from HBOS in 2008 after its emergency rescue by Lloyds TSB, took over the top job at the Restaurant Group at the beginning of August and will present first-half results on Tuesday. It is the first time he has led a publicly listed company since leaving HBOS at the height of the financial crisis. He has joined the company, which also owns the Frankie &amp; Benny\u2019s, Chiquito and Garfunkel\u2019s chains, at a challenging time for the casual dining market. Jamie Oliver\u2019s Italian chain closed in May and several others, including Prezzo and Strada, closed branches.

The company had to tap shareholders for \u00a3315m to help fund the deal and 40% of investors voted against the acquisition, which they considered too expensive. The deal was finalised during a crisis for the casual dining sector, which has been squeezed by rising costs, low consumer confidence and heavy competition as a result of private equity fuelled overexpansion of chains such as Byron, Strada and Carluccio\u2019s. The trend toward home delivery boosted by apps such as Deliveroo and Just Eat is also eating into restaurants\u2019 profits as they make less money on takeaways. Negotiating a way forward for the Restaurant Group would be the next step in a rehabilitation for Hornby, who was criticised in a 2013 inquiry for being in part responsible for \u201ccatastrophic failures of management\u201d that led to HBOS\u2019s near-collapse during the 2008 financial crisis. \u201cHornby\u2019s CV has one big black mark against it, but he is generally a leisure industry person and his record there is pretty good,\u201d said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.

These areas of medicine are not without their problems but there is no doubt advancements in these fields have saved millions of lives. But women are more than reproductive machines. And, while women who live in chronic pain aren\u2019t dying horrible deaths in the prime of their lives \u2013 like those who died in such large numbers in childbirth or from breast cancer \u2013 evidence shows that chronic pain does lead to anxiety, depression and suicide. For many others, it keeps them at home and out of the workforce, unable to fully take part in life. I wrote this book because too many women are in pain, and that pain is not taken seriously. It is at once expected and denied. This deprives us of our full humanity. We deserve better. \u2022 Pain and Prejudice by Gabrielle Jackson is published in Australia on 3 September (Allen and Unwin, $29.99), and in the UK on 14 November (Little, Brown, \u00a313.99)",

      "bodyText": "The European Union will push Australia to clean up its petrol standards \u2013 which currently allow for dirtier fuel than India and China \u2013 as part of negotiations on a new free trade agreement. As the EU and Australia prepare for the next round of FTA negotiations in October, Guardian Australia understands the issue of Australia\u2019s poor fuel quality, which prevents the sale of a range of European vehicles with higher standard engines, has already been raised at a bureaucratic level as a \u201ctechnical barrier to trade\u201d. Europe will also be using the EU-Australia free trade agreement to cement Australia\u2019s support for emissions reduction targets agreed to under the Paris accord, with Europe flagging it wants the \u201crespect and full implementation of the Paris agreement\u201d underscored in the text of the agreement. The issue of fuel quality is one of a raft of industrial barriers that Europe is pushing Australia to consider as part of a wide-ranging new free trade agreement, along with the removal of a 5% industrial tariff and changes to Australia\u2019s luxury car tax, which overwhelmingly hits European vehicles. Australia ranks 66th in the world for its fuel quality, the lowest of all developed countries, with an allowable sulphur content up to 15 times higher than countries like China. Australia\u2019s most popular unleaded petrol \u2013 91 unleaded \u2013 allows sulphur levels of up to 150 parts per million compared to the 10ppm allowed by the European Union, and the government has indicated this will not change until 2027. This means some of the best and cleanest European cars cannot be exported to Australia, leaving some manufacturers to either export older generation engines on certain models, or to not export them at all. The federal chamber of automotive industries has said that without Australia\u2019s fuel quality being brought into line with other developed countries, the \u201clatest-technology, low-emission engines cannot be supported in the domestic market\u201d. The Fcai has also told a parliamentary hearing into electric vehicles that improving Australia\u2019s fuel quality would offer a \u201c3% to 5%\u201d improvement on CO2 performance \u201covernight\u201d. In 2015, the Coalition set up a ministerial forum on vehicle emissions aimed at addressing three proposals for improving fuel standards that were outlined in a 2018 discussion paper. But the forum has been criticised over its inaction, and before the May election the government quietly postponed fuel standard improvements for Australian refiners until 1 July 2027, in line with the petroleum industry\u2019s demand.

Tariffs on imported lamb and beef to the EU are as high as 50%, but Europe is considering a boost to the low tariff quota allowed to Australian exporters for high-quality produce. Europe is pushing for Australian action on so-called \u201cgeographic indicators\u201d, which would prevent Australian producers using a suite of brand names it deems to be its intellectual property, such as feta, gruyere and gorgonzola. Australian cheesemakers have expressed concern that the proposed ban on product names could require expensive rebranding and cost jobs. Asked about the progress being made on the FTA, negotiations for which began in June 2018, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, said it was \u201ccomplex\u201d. \u201cIt is just step by step by step by step,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there is a real keenness to engage with Australia.\u201d",

      "body": "<p><br>Queensland\u2019s most influential farm lobby group, AgForce, has backed calls for a review of consensus science on the Great Barrier Reef, as the state\u2019s agricultural sector intensifies its campaign against proposed water quality regulations.</p> <p>On Friday the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/aug/30/great-barrier-reef-outlook-now-very-poor-australian-government-review-says\">release of two key reports</a> painted an alarming picture of the state of the reef. The Queensland-led water quality report \u2013 which rated the water quality at inner reefs as \u201cpoor\u201d \u2013 highlighted the impact of land management practices that contribute to the degradation of the reef due to sediment and nutrient run-off.</p> <p>The findings were released at a critical point in debate about the Queensland government\u2019s proposed regulations, which would set variable pollution limits in separate reef catchments.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/aug/30/great-barrier-reef-outlook-now-very-poor-australian-government-review-says\">Great Barrier Reef outlook now 'very poor', Australian government review says</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Agricultural groups say those regulations will have a significant impact on farmers; particularly graziers, sugarcane growers and tropical horticulture.</p> <p>Some farmers accept the consensus science, but claim the regulations are ill thought out and will have unintended consequences for primary producers.

      "bodyText": "Queensland\u2019s most influential farm lobby group, AgForce, has backed calls for a review of consensus science on the Great Barrier Reef, as the state\u2019s agricultural sector intensifies its campaign against proposed water quality regulations. On Friday the release of two key reports painted an alarming picture of the state of the reef. The Queensland-led water quality report \u2013 which rated the water quality at inner reefs as \u201cpoor\u201d \u2013 highlighted the impact of land management practices that contribute to the degradation of the reef due to sediment and nutrient run-off. The findings were released at a critical point in debate about the Queensland government\u2019s proposed regulations, which would set variable pollution limits in separate reef catchments. Agricultural groups say those regulations will have a significant impact on farmers; particularly graziers, sugarcane growers and tropical horticulture. Some farmers accept the consensus science, but claim the regulations are ill thought out and will have unintended consequences for primary producers. This is also the formal position of the LNP opposition. But increasingly, sober debate about the impact of the regulations has veered into science scepticism; pushed by the controversial scientist Peter Ridd, some of the larger peak industry bodies, backbench LNP MPs and opaque front groups. The AgForce chief executive, Michael Guerin, in a statement to Guardian Australia sent before the release of the latest reef reports, said the organisation agreed with Ridd\u2019s calls for the science \u201cto be more thoroughly examined and tested\u201d. Last week Guardian Australia revealed that an expert panel led by the former chief scientist Ian Chubb had warned ministers that Ridd is misrepresenting robust science about the plight of the reef, and compared his claims to the strategy used by the tobacco industry to raise doubt about the impact of smoking. Guerin said there \u201cwas no absolute consensus\u201d on the reef. \u201cWe are not scientists and have no position on the science. However, when eminent reef scientists call into question the research conducted by their peers, we as a community would be foolish not to listen. \u201cWe are simply asking the government to make sure of the science before it implements such momentous changes with potentially devastating consequences for so many.\u201d The AgForce general president and ABC board member Georgie Somerset will speak at a protest rally of famers in Townsville on Tuesday to coincide with a sitting of the state parliament. The event is being promoted by the opaque front organisation Farmers United, with flyers quoting Ridd and featuring the AgForce logo. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The industry argues regulation is not necessary, and that \u201cbest management practice\u201d measures, led by agricultural groups and funded by government, were the best method to address water quality issues. Earlier this year, in protest against the proposed regulations and citing privacy concerns, AgForce deleted a decade of data from its BMP database. The Queensland environment minister, Leeanne Enoch, said on Friday that the reef water quality report showed that voluntary BMP programs were not working quickly enough, and that urgent action was needed to address the health of the reef. \u201cThe report \u2026 shows land-based run-off still remains a problem and that urgent changes are needed if we are going to meet our targets,\u201d Enoch said. \u201cThe report also shows that many farmers have been doing good work to help improve the quality of run-off, but unfortunately the science is showing that uptake has not been fast enough. \u201cFor example, we want 90% of sugarcane land across the reef catchments managed using best management practice systems by 2025. But, the results show this was happening on only 9.8% of land so far. \u201cOverall water quality modelling showed only a 0.3% reduction in dissolved inorganic nitrogen and a 0.5% reduction in sediment in 2017-2018 across all regions. \u201cThis simply isn\u2019t enough. There are also a lot of scores that are poor, or very poor.\u201d As large agricultural groups seek to question the science, largely on the basis of a single opinion rejected by scores of other reef scientists, questions have grown about whether they can continue to manage millions in grants allocated for reef water quality measures. AgForce jointly manages Queensland-funded BMP programs. AgForce last year lobbied in support of the controversial $433m federal grant to the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, and at the time noted that \u201cagricultural land is one of many factors which can affect water quality and the long term health\u201d of the reef. The Greens senator Peter Whish-Wilson has written to the federal environment minister, Sussan Ley, suggesting groups that receive reef foundation grants to improve water quality, but who otherwise seek to question the underlying science, have a conflict of interest. He cited support for Ridd\u2019s recent lecture tour from regional branches of the peak organisation Canegrowers. \u201cOn the face of it, this is a conflict of interest. The activity of Queensland Canegrowers (as a subcontractor) is impairing the ability of the foundation to improve water quality in the reef.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The UK\u2019s reliance on electricity imports has climbed to a record high amid fears that homes and businesses could face higher energy bills if the UK crashes out of Europe. The latest government figures, released just weeks before Britain\u2019s exit from the EU, show that the UK\u2019s net electricity imports reached their highest ever level in the first quarter of this year. The four high-voltage power cables linking the UK to Europe\u2019s energy markets imported a sixth more electricity than the year before, after a new interconnector opened in January. In total, European electricity imports made up almost 7% of the UK\u2019s total demand, and the government hopes to increase imports to about 20% by 2025. Although this is a small share of the UK\u2019s electricity, experts have warned that higher import prices could lead to higher energy bills. The government\u2019s leaked no-deal planning report, Operation Yellowhammer, predicted a marked increase in energy prices for homes and businesses if the UK crashes out without a deal. The market price for electricity could climb because of a fall in the value of the pound against the euro, but also because of potentially costly complications of severing ties with EU energy markets. Gas and electricity bills rose by \u00a32bn in the year after the 2016 referendum result because of the plummeting value of the pound, according to a report from University College London. This translated into an average household\u2019s bill increasing by \u00a335 for electricity and \u00a340 for gas, and researchers predicted bills would climb by a further \u00a361 every year in the years following the referendum. A report commissioned by National Grid before the referendum predicted that energy bills could climb by \u00a3500m every year by the 2020s if the UK left the EU\u2019s internal energy market. Kristian Ruby, the head of pan-European trade association Eurelectric, said a no-deal exit could mean the UK faces third-party costs to use the power lines connecting Britain to European power markets, which would raise the overall cost of the energy. Ruby said the UK might also find it more difficult to trade if it were left out of the complex pan-European trading system, and this could place a \u201crisk premium\u201d on UK prices. \u201cWhen you throw all rules up in the air at the same time, this lack of clarity, predictability and rule of law is what is very concerning for us,\u201d he added. A spokesperson said the government had taken steps to make sure energy trading continued and that energy laws \u201cwork effectively and provide value for money\u201d. The Guardian understands that a pan-European network of energy system operators has agreed a plan for the UK to remain within the internal market on a voluntary basis which would offer the same commercial terms. A spokesman for National Grid, which runs the UK\u2019s power cables, said it was \u201cnot anticipating any additional charges for interconnectors in the event of a no-deal Brexit\u201d. However, the plan has not been agreed by the European commission and could be cast in doubt if the UK leaves without an agreement or without paying the \u00a339bn exit fee. Alexander Temerko, a major Conservative party donor, said he feared electricity market prices could jump by almost a third if the UK does not remain part of the EU\u2019s internal energy market after a no-deal Brexit. The Ukrainian-born billionaire, who is planning to build a new electricity cable between the UK and mainland Europe, said the price hike could mean higher bills and negative consequences for UK business. Temerko publicly dropped his support for Boris Johnson during the Conservative leadership campaign earlier this year over fears he could steer Britain towards a no-deal Brexit. \u201cIf we have a no-deal Brexit all existing regulations for the transmission of electricity will be terminated with immediate effect. I don\u2019t know how quickly, or how high, the price of electricity would jump. My expert opinion is that prices could jump by 30%. But there are no scenarios for this.

      "bodyText": "Anyway ... here is the report from our man David Hytner. Thanks for joining me. Souness bemoans defenders passing the ball and instead wants them to just whack it down the line. He is still available as a manager. Less than ideal ... Peter Dawson ponders: \u201cRegarding Kane penalty shout, if that was a defender protecting the ball and bundled over like that, it\u2019s a free kick, even if they\u2019re playing for the foul. I don\u2019t see how that is not a penalty.\u201d Sol Campbell goes a little more old school by praising the \u201ccharacter\u201d of the two teams. Mourinho says if either team had more \u201cbrains\u201d they would have won today. Aubameyang says Arsenal deserved more in the first half and they merited the win. He is keen on emphasising that it was a tough game, adding the timing of Lacazette\u2019s opener just before the break was \u201ccrucial\u201d. We have a plan ... Mary Waltz says: \u201cThe most undeserved point for Tottenham this year. How did Arsenal not win that fixture.\u201d Lloris and Lacazette share a hug, which is nice. Both teams should be proud of getting through the game. Who will be happiest? Arsenal will be disappointed they didn\u2019t find a winner when they certainly had enough of the ball to do so but just couldn\u2019t get the third. Spurs on the other hand had a two-goal lead and could not hold on. A draw is fair result. It was a great game, which is the most important thing. 90+4 mins: Kane gets into the box and goes down under pressure from Sokratis. One could argue Kane was being clever with his body position but it\u2019s close to being a dive. It\u2019s not a penalty, that\u2019s for sure. 90+2 mins: Xhaka is booked! Kane gets away from him, so he just pulls him down. A feat for the midfielder to go this long with a caution. Well done young sir. 90 mins: Sissoko is the only Spurs player with any energy left and wins the ball back on the halfway line, takes it into the box but when he tries to slip in Kane it goes straight to Leno. Five minutes added on. 89 mins: Spurs have realised that whacking the ball as far away from their own net is a better idea than tapping it around the back. It results in Kane getting a chance to cross for Alli at the back post but Luiz steers it wide for a corner. The resulting set-piece sees Eriksen\u2019s cross cleared. 87 mins: WE HAVE A MELEE!! Sokratis and Winks clash on the touchline and then everyone else joins in for their amusement. Atkinson stays out of it until giving everyone a talking to and explaining they need to grow up. Sokratis goes in the book for his troubles. 85 mins: Sanchez proves my point by completely failing to do with a long ball which he heads back into the danger area where Mkhitaryan picks it up but just can\u2019t get a meaningful shot away. Eventually Pepe strikes it but drags his shot wide. 83 mins: Everything is coming down Spurs\u2019 right as Sanchez is on a booking and absolutely knackered. Surely Aurier needs to be on soon. Alli calls for a penalty/free-kick after Ceballos wrestles him to the ground but nothing is doing. 81 mins: Eriksen whips in a free-kick from a dangerous position on the left but it doesn\u2019t beat the first man. Spurs needed to make for of that. Lo Celso then is blocked off by Xhaka, who has so far avoided a booking. 79 mins: Sokratis turns the ball in at the back post but the goal is ruled out after the crosser, Kolasinac, is ruled to be offside when he received the pass. 77 mins: Spurs really don\u2019t know how to cope at the moment. There\u2019s plenty of whacking the ball clear and watching it come straight back. They need a change of some sort. Chris Taberner points out my lack of interest in facts: \u201cSheffield United, Everton and Crystal Palace have all committed more fouls per game than Man City this season, pesky facts eh.\u201d He misses the point, which is that City commit cynical fouls to end attacks and will naturally commit fewer as they have so much possession but they just know when to break things down. It\u2019s about knowing when to foul. 75 mins: Winks is the latest man to go into the book, as Spurs try valiantly to hold on. Xhaka almost puts Arsenal in the lead by whacking a swerving drive from 35 yards but Lloris knows where it\u2019s going and palms the ball away from danger. 73 mins: The Emirates is rocking. There\u2019s some great passing going on and plenty of little fouls to keep the adrenaline up. Jonathan emails in to discuss a point: \u201cRe 59 mins... Not welders but joiners surely? Although if there are any of either in the ground I\u2019d be surprised. They all look more like web developers to me, or Jujitsu coaches. Ah, bugger, just missed a goal typing you that\u201d It has been coming for a long time and Arsenal finally have the equaliser. Guendouzi lifts in a lovely ball over the Spurs defence, allowing Aubameyang to dart between two centre-backs and poke it into the bottom corner. It\u2019s all about the pass and the movement. Arsenal at their best. 69 mins: Spurs are really committed to this short goal-kick and it final pays off with a nice move until Winks, ironically, whacks the ball straight down the pitch to Leno. 67 mins: Sokratis has a cunning new plan: to throw himself to the floor during attacking corners in the hope VAR will deem it a foul. It\u2019s all a bit Baldrick. Mkhitaryan replaces Lacazette, who seems to have a slight issue. 65 mins: Ceballos almost makes an instant impact. He picks the ball up 35 yards from goal, twists and turns to get away from Sissoko, before unleashing an incredible shot which dips just under the bar but Lloris is there to tip it over. 63 mins: Ceballos is finally coming on to replace Torreira. It should provide greater creativity. Robert Blackwell is pleased: \u201cGreat question!! Surely the Premiership referees association must discuss this in there meetings as it is a growing and cynical problem In the game.....surely a few more yellow cards should be started to be shown there way...\u201d Here is the original question: \u201cDoes anyone know the last time City failed to outfoul their opponents? They manage it routinely (mostly within ten yards of the halfway line) even when they have 60/70% of the possession.\u201d 61 mins: Appeals for a penalty from Arsenal as Aubameyang goes down under pressure but Atkinson is having none of it. No VAR review, either, which is a relief. 59 mins: Kane almost completes a great little move, ending with the striker playing a one-two with Eriksen, allowing Kane a shot from an acute angle which he whacks against the inside of the post with such ferocity that any welders in the ground will be weeping. 57 mins: The hosts cut through Spurs again allowing Guendouzi to fire a low shot towards the bottom corner but Lloris reads it and tips it wide. The resulting corner, is flicked towards the back post but Kolasinac and Aubameyang just can\u2019t reach it to steer it home. 55 mins: Arsenal have dominated since the whistle in this half. Spurs will need to up their tempo a little here to stay in the lead. Spurs do break with Son and he tries to slip through a pass to Lamela but Luiz reads it cuts out the danger. 53 mins: Lamela runs at Luiz with the ball at his feet, lays it off to Son on the edge of the box and he whips a shot towards the bottom corner which deflects off Xhaka and then the fingertips of Leno. 51 mins: There are plenty of tackles flying in at the Emirates. This game is getting a bit more like Ian Selley v David Howells than Xhaka v Eriksen. 49 mins: Joseph Harvey asks: \u201cWhat is it about Ceballos that doesn\u2019t let him start in these matches? He can\u2019t be worse than Xhaka. This is the second manger he\u2019s got that doesn\u2019t rate him despite, from the stands, looking like the complete package at Real and Arsenal (in very limited viewing so far, I admit).\u201d I feel this midfielder needs something a bit more dynamic. 47 mins: Arsenal show some early intent, as Pepe lifts a cross onto the penalty spot where Lacazette is waiting but his header is well held by Lloris despite a difficult bounce. Lloris then dawdles on the ball with Arsenal\u2019s attacking coming for him and eventually plays a weak pass out to Vertonghen which is intercepted by Aubameyang but luckily makes it straight back to the goalkeeper. Here we go again! And by magic, Geoff Wignall agrees with me: \u201cIt seems a tad harsh to castigate Spurs for becoming a cynical and dirty side (Sandile, HT). After all they are trying to close the gap to Man City: when in Rome, etc.Does anyone know the last time City failed to outfoul their opponents? They manage it routinely (mostly within ten yards of the halfway line) even when they have 60/70% of the possession.\u201d Ben Melb emails: \u201cI agree with Sandile. Tottenham have become very dirty. I think it stems from Deli Ali with his fake bravado and aggression but mostly acts as a bully/coward. Similar to Ashley young, who\u2019s done it for years, and displayed the same thing during the stoppage time injury yesterday.\u201d Maybe they are just copying Manchester City\u2019s style of cynical fouls to end attacks. Cunning like foxes. Abhijato Sensarma asks: \u201cWill Ozil ever start for Arsenal again?\u201d Obviously, yes. Jeremy Dresner emails: \u201cArsenal look a different team to previous incarnations. With Luiz pinging the ball over top, the Arsenal midfield becomes a bypassed sideshow. Guendouzi especially is sideshow\u2019s sideshow if you will. Luiz is leaving space as he marauds and it shows for his side as spurs exploit the space.\u201d As any fan of cliches will tell you ... there\u2019s no better time to score than just before half-time if you\u2019re trying to get back into a game. It should give Arsenal momentum going into the second period. Some HT correspondence: Jonathan offers: \u201cGood God xhaka lucky to stay on the pitch never mind concede a penalty. It sums up the last ten fifteen minutes though..spurs so much quicker in thought and action, arsenal leaden footed.\u201d Mary says: \u201cIt must be so frustrating to root for the gunners. It\u2019s must be like dating a Pulitzer Prize author whose also a Vogue model. Then you find out she is also a heroin addict.\u201d Sandile gives his view: \u201cIt\u2019s been a part of their play under Pochettino for a while but Spurs have become a cynical, dirty team haven\u2019t they? They roughed up Ajax in the Champions League last season.\u201d Arsenal have had more of the ball but Spurs have looked more incisive. Luckily, the hosts have reduced the arrears and we should be in for a cracking second half. Lacazette fires a free-kick from 20 yards, forcing Lloris into a fine save which goes straight to Rose who seems to handball it. Calls for a penalty go round the stands as Spurs fail to clear the ball and it ends up back in the box with Lacazette, who takes two great touches and then smashes a shot beyond Lloris from close range. 45 mins: Sissoko brings down Aubameyang on the edge of the box for his own amusement. Two minutes added on. 44 mins: Lloris has had nothing to do for almost 45 minutes, but he proves he is alert as Maitland-Niles flicks the ball into Pepe, who carves out a low drive from 12 yards but Lloris is equal to it and, more importantly, holds on. Stephen Carr (possibly that one) says: \u201cIf Arsenal are going to get anything out of this game, they are going to have to display more passivity and stupidity.\u201d 42 mins: In hindsight, Xhaka was only a second or two late on that challenge. Just a shame it was around the knee. What can Arsenal do to turn this around? Ceballos should be on soon and possibly Ozil, too. If you like your challenges to be stupid, then Xhaka is your man. He dives and, ultimately, through Son in the box to give away the penalty. Kane steps up and sends the goalkeeper the wrong way. Xhaka is so stupid there. 38 mins: Eriksen lines up a free-kick from 30 yards out. The Dane lifts the ball over the wall and Leno shows his better side with a sprawling dive to the right and he claws it out. 36 mins: Another poor piece of goalkeeping from Leno almost gifts a second to Spurs. Kane hits a weak effort from 20 yards which Leno palms away needlessly, allowing Son to put the ball back into the danger area but Kane can\u2019t get his shot away and danger is averted. 34 mins: Aubameyang is released down the right and lofts a cross into the box for Pepe to attack but Spurs have enough men back to clear it away. Lacazette tries to be decisive but instead just whacks a ball down the pitch and out of play. Nick emails: \u201cBe it not I to bandy accusations about, But how big a fan of Arsenal are you? Your commentary smacks at bias\u2026 I bet you loved typing Arsenal fans\u2019 original chant?\u201d Man City, mate. 32 mins: Arsenal have dominated possession but Lloris has maintained an untroubled afternoon. More incisive play is needed. 30 mins: Pepe swings in a free-kick from the right; it\u2019s a dangerous cross but Spurs have plenty of men in the box and Kane is the man to flick it for a corner. Pepe\u2019s corner is headed behind again, this time by Alderweireld while facing the wrong way. Referee Atkinson has spotted an issue involving Danny Rose and gives him a talking to. It wouldn\u2019t be a good time to get sent off. 28 mins: Lacazette is brought down 30 yards from goal. Pepe and Luiz line up the opportunity. Who will pull rank? It\u2019s Pepe who gets the free-kick round the wall but it goes well wide. Not a great effort. The first booking of the game goes to Rose after a laughable short goal-kick puts Spurs under pressure, the left-back loses the ball and he cleans out Lacazette. 26 mins: Arsenal getting more of the ball but the midfield three aren\u2019t the best at using it. We might need to see Ceballos sooner than anticipated. 24 mins: Aubameyang gets the better of Sanchez on the left, clips a cross to the back post where Pepe is waiting but his header is blocked by a jumping Rose. The corner is cleared to the edge of the area from where Torreira pokes it wide. Arsenal should just focus on attacking down the left flank if I am being honest as Sanchez looks out of his depth. 22 mins: Arsenal fans sing \u201cstand up if you hate Tottenham\u201d. A distinct lack of originality from the home faithful. 20 mins: Spurs know they can get at this defence. Luiz and Sokratis look a long way from the perfect pairing and can be dragged around. Guendouzi goes down under a challenge from Sanchez, who catches the midfielder late late on the heel. 18 mins: WHAT A SAVE! Spurs counter once more as a cross is cleared up to Son on the halfway. The South Korean bides his time as he dribbles towards the box, before cut inside and curling a shot towards the top corner but Leno reads it and palms the ball over. 16 mins: Arsenal must be playing three defensive midfielders due to the fact their defence is so ropey. Luiz and Sokratis both got caught out in the counter for the goal. The knock-on effect of the goal is that Eriksen is looking more confident, proved by him whipping in a shot from 25 yards which Leno pats down. 14 mins: Kolasinac breaks into the box and looks set to steer a perfect cross into the box but the full-back stumbles and his cross is pretty pathetic and the danger is removed. \u201cThat is the risk you take when David Luiz is protecting your back door,\u201d Mary Waltz points out. 12 mins: For a fans of narrative, Eriksen scoring for Spurs while all these rumours about his future abound, it\u2019s pretty exciting news. Arsenal are done on the counter-attack as Kane wins a flick-on, Son darts for the box, before slipping in Lamela who shoots, Leno palms it out but straight into the path of the onrushing Eriksen. A sucker punch. 8 mins: Sanchez plays the ball into Kane\u2019s feet with his back to goal, the striker tries to spin his man but falls over in the process. Kane will need a bit more support if he\u2019s to have an influence here. 6 mins: A corner is whipped into the box by Arsenal and the ball makes it way to Maitland-Niles on the edge of the box. The full-back drives a shot at goal but Kane is in the right place to block the effort. Jonathan Baker is thinking similar to the rest of us: \u201cGoing to be a long afternoon at right back for Sanchez by the looks of his first three interventions I\u2019d say.\u201d 4 mins: There\u2019s an intensity to Arsenal\u2019s play in the opening stages, while Spurs are struggling to get hold of the ball. Kane smashes a long ball down the pitch for Son to chase but it bounces through to Leno. 2 mins: It\u2019s a lively at the Emirates, which can\u2019t always be said of the Arsenal stadium. Aubameyang gets the home fans going with a backheeled through ball to Kolasinac, who crosses to Pepe, only for the summer signing to thwack the ball over from the edge of the area. Peep! Peep! Peep! Let\u2019s get ready to rumble! Mourinho \u201cbelieves in everything\u201d when it comes to the result today. Bold prediction. Sky has treated us to another montage, so we must be close to kick-off. Davinson Sanchez at right back is an odd choice in a big game such as this. He has never played there, as far as I am aware, and has never struck me as someone who good do a job in such a position. Let\u2019s all hope he proves me wrong, so that I can eat some humble pie at the end. Serge Aurier cannot be feeling good about himself. You have to say, that hair is magnificent ... Mourinho says he spent some time watching Lille after leaving United to give him something to do. It\u2019s not exactly driving to Dundee in your bare feet. Mourinho points out that Pepe is good at football. Pochettino says Eriksen is in the right frame of mind to play and that it is almost impossible that the Dane will leave the club tomorrow. Emery is asked a very simple question and gives a very complicated answer, which ends with him saying he feels the team can play well. Oh ... Some stats so I don\u2019t have to bother ... A delightful dinner date ... Everton have just won 3-2 against Wolves in a cracking match. The result sees the Toffees move above Arsenal but three points for the Gunners will get them up to third, which would be a cracking place to be going into the international break. Ozil is on the bench for Arsenal and Emery is really keen to keep and utilise the German playmaker, who has endured a tricky summer. Ravel is an Arsenal fan ... After careful analysis of the Spurs lineup, it looks like it could be a 3-4-3, with Rose and Sissoko on the flanks, a front three of Lamela, Kane and Son. It should make it ruddy exciting. Spurs are a little bit different, according to their manager ... Did somebody order a banter? Torreira, Xhaka and Guendouzi is a pretty solid base for a midfield, so it should permit plenty of freedom to Pepe et al in the final third to really do what they want. I am yet to see much of Pepe in an Arsenal shirt, so I am fascinated to see how he copes with a derby. I feel he might thrive on it. Anyway ... here\u2019s the incomparable Nick Ames on Unai Emery finding his rhythm. So ... we have the lineups. Arsenal do go with the exciting front three and Ozil makes the bench. For Spurs it is a return to the back three, with Vertonghen coming in. I am not particularly sure how the midfield will look, seeing as they have plenty of attacking players included; Lamela, Eriksen, Sissoko and Son all start, so it should be fun to see how that fits together. Arsenal: Leno, Maitland-Niles, Sokratis, Luiz, Kolasinac, Torreira, Xhaka, Guendouzi, Pepe, Lacazette, Aubameyang. Subs: Martinez, Mkhitaryan, Ceballos, Ozil, Chambers, Nelson, Willock. Spurs: Lloris, Sanchez, Vertonghen, Alderweireld, Rose, Winks, Eriksen, Sissoko, Lamela, Son, Kane. Subs: Gazzaniga, Lo Celso, Alli, Aurier, Moura, Skipp, Davies. Good afternoon! Here we are; the game which will supposedly define seasons or some other nonsense like that. Arsenal need to prove they can be consistently competent in the Premier League, while Spurs will to show they are better than a team that gets beat by Newcastle at home. Will Arsenal show their teeth with an attacking front three of Aubameyang, Lacazette and Pepe? It would be a wonderful show of intent against a Spurs defence which is still trying to settle this season. They could even come up against Vertonghen who has been out of favour so far but could return due to the underwhelming efforts of the other centre-backs. For Spurs, it is all about whether Eriksen is brought into the starting lineup as they really require someone who can create chances and he is certainly a man who can do that. However, due to the impending closure of the European transfer window, the Dane\u2019s desire to leave and few players of his quality being available, it could be a case that he is left out once again. It should be pretty enjoyable either way, as it\u2019s a lovely day for football in north London.",

      "bodyText": "One of the UK\u2019s top employment experts believes the young aide sacked by Dominic Cummings may have been unfairly dismissed from her job. Sonia Khan, a Treasury media adviser, was escorted by armed police from Downing Street after a confrontation with No 10\u2019s chief strategist over her contact with those close to the former chancellor Philip Hammond. She was accused of lying about her conversations with Hammond\u2019s former staff member Poppy Trowbridge by Cummings, who is understood to have found evidence they had been in touch on her personal mobile phone. John Bowers QC, a leading employment barrister, said: \u201cIf she did lie then clearly there would be a basis for dismissal but it doesn\u2019t look as though any proper procedure was adopted and HR wasn\u2019t present. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t given the right to be represented and being bundled off the premises by police is completely humiliating so I think it would be unfair dismissal.\u201d Cummings was said to be unrepentant about his high-profile sacking of the 27-year-old Khan, who had been working for the current chancellor, Sajid Javid, and before that for Hammond as an adviser. In a meeting on Friday night with Boris Johnson\u2019s team of special advisers \u2013 known as spads \u2013 Cummings is said to have remarked: \u201cIf you don\u2019t like how I run things, there\u2019s the door.\u201d There is no indication Khan is planning on taking any legal action against the government over her sacking. Despite several requests for an investigation into Cummings\u2019 behaviour by the government\u2019s head of propriety and ethics, Helen McNamara, no inquiry is currently taking place although she has spoken to Khan about the incident. Although she worked for the chancellor, spads such as Khan are held ultimately responsible to the prime minister\u2019s office. Javid confronted Boris Johnson in a heated discussion about why his staff member had been fired without his knowledge. Yvette Cooper, the Labour chair of the Commons home affairs select committee, said: \u201cGovernment advisers must not abuse their power by drawing the police into heavy-handed political stunts. This needs to be reviewed by the cabinet secretary and the Metropolitan police straight away.\u201d Bowers added: \u201cShe should have been given warning of what the meeting was about. It may be that they needn\u2019t have told her what evidence they had against her, but the nature of the meeting and fact that it could lead to dismissal, she should have been told about that.\u201d He said the humiliation of her being marched out of No 10 would aggravate the element of unfairness in what happened to her and a tribunal judge \u201cwould hate that\u201d. Unfair dismissal cases can only be brought if someone has worked for an organisation for more than two years, unless it is a case of discrimination or whistleblowing. Khan began working for the civil service in 2014 and became an adviser in 2018. It is not known whether she has unbroken service. There was outrage surrounding Cummings\u2019 move to fire Khan last Thursday, with No 10 described as operating amid a \u201cclimate of fear\u201d. The prime minister also faces being summoned to the Commons on Monday to answer an urgent question on the handling of the case.",

The prime minister is complicit in undermining deliberative democracy and replacing it with lies. The will of the people, absurdly, is now defined by the 52% who voted leave three years ago.

They ought to be backed. Britain teeters on the cliff edge of a hard Brexit. Even with the support of 10 DUP MPs, a dozen or so Tory rebels can bring down a wayward Johnson government by leaving it. In response, the prime minister has refused to rule out <a href=\"https://www.theneweuropean.co.uk/top-stories/david-gauke-losing-whip-on-no-deal-1-6246541\" title=\"\">automatically deselecting</a> any Tory MP who moves against his administration. With a majority of just one, it is only a matter of time before Mr Johnson will have to go the country in a snap general election. When the prime minister does so, he will want to do it on the best possible terms. To remain in the EU would mean Mr Johnson\u2019s political death. His own party membership has become so radicalised that they would rather <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/poll-conservative-members-break-up-uk-destroy-party-stop-brexit-2019-6?r=US&amp;IR=T\" title=\"\">break up the United Kingdom than not leave the EU</a>.</p> <p>Without a withdrawal agreement to offer MPs, Mr Johnson would be forced to own the damaging social, economic and political consequences of a no-deal Brexit \u2013 but he would be able to unite the right. The cries of betrayal from Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party would ring hollow in the ears of leavers if the prime minister pursued a no-deal Brexit. With a withdrawal agreement, obtained by <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-49540681\" title=\"\">somehow convincing the EU</a> to remove the Irish backstop, Mr Johnson would have to secure the backing of Labour MPs to offset <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/johnson-braced-for-spartans-backlash-over-withdrawal-agreement-minus-backstop-plan_uk_5d651cf2e4b0d2fa2db12be6\" title=\"\">hardline</a> Conservative MPs from the European Research Group who will accept nothing short of a hard Brexit. If he managed to do so, then the prime minister could claim to have split the Labour party.</p> <p>Politics is about perception. What ought to worry us all is that Mr Johnson feels he has enough popular support in the country not only to pursue a hard Brexit but to weaponise it in an election campaign. No holds will be barred by a prime minister who has suspended parliament for five weeks \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/28/pms-plan-to-suspend-parliament-aimed-at-evading-scrutiny-of-mps\" title=\"\">the longest prorogation since 1945</a> \u2013 to narrow the possible window of opposition, or by his ministers who refuse to rule out ignoring any law passed by parliament to stop no deal.</p> <p>This is in itself an election strategy. Mr Johnson\u2019s experience as the face of Vote Leave has taught him how to turn outrage into political energy. Since taking office, his administration has <a href=\"https://constitution-unit.com/2019/06/30/six-constitutional-questions-raised-by-the-election-of-the-new-conservative-leader/\" title=\"\">leaked</a> the idea that it is prepared to do the constitutionally shocking to deliver Brexit. Mr Johnson has then allowed his government to bathe in the flood of negative publicity, and use the media\u2019s coverage \u2013 particularly focusing on the storm of fury and indignation \u2013 to whip up the Tory grassroots, generate interest in their hard Brexitism, and stoke the belief that a \u201cremainer elite\u201d was against them. The trouble is that Mr Johnson is not bothered about playing fast and loose with the truth. It is part of his plan to paint himself as a victim of remainer bias ahead of an impending election. Whatever the outcome of the UK-EU negotiations in the next few weeks, Brexit is just the beginning of a much longer process that shows no sign of doing this country any good at all.</p>",

His own party membership has become so radicalised that they would rather break up the United Kingdom than not leave the EU. Without a withdrawal agreement to offer MPs, Mr Johnson would be forced to own the damaging social, economic and political consequences of a no-deal Brexit \u2013 but he would be able to unite the right. The cries of betrayal from Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party would ring hollow in the ears of leavers if the prime minister pursued a no-deal Brexit. With a withdrawal agreement, obtained by somehow convincing the EU to remove the Irish backstop, Mr Johnson would have to secure the backing of Labour MPs to offset hardline Conservative MPs from the European Research Group who will accept nothing short of a hard Brexit. If he managed to do so, then the prime minister could claim to have split the Labour party. Politics is about perception. What ought to worry us all is that Mr Johnson feels he has enough popular support in the country not only to pursue a hard Brexit but to weaponise it in an election campaign. No holds will be barred by a prime minister who has suspended parliament for five weeks \u2013 the longest prorogation since 1945 \u2013 to narrow the possible window of opposition, or by his ministers who refuse to rule out ignoring any law passed by parliament to stop no deal. This is in itself an election strategy. Mr Johnson\u2019s experience as the face of Vote Leave has taught him how to turn outrage into political energy. Since taking office, his administration has leaked the idea that it is prepared to do the constitutionally shocking to deliver Brexit. Mr Johnson has then allowed his government to bathe in the flood of negative publicity, and use the media\u2019s coverage \u2013 particularly focusing on the storm of fury and indignation \u2013 to whip up the Tory grassroots, generate interest in their hard Brexitism, and stoke the belief that a \u201cremainer elite\u201d was against them. The trouble is that Mr Johnson is not bothered about playing fast and loose with the truth. It is part of his plan to paint himself as a victim of remainer bias ahead of an impending election. Whatever the outcome of the UK-EU negotiations in the next few weeks, Brexit is just the beginning of a much longer process that shows no sign of doing this country any good at all.",

Those wavering Tory MPs who had hoped to postpone their personal moment of truth to give him time to agree a Brexit deal no longer have that luxury. On Tuesday MPs are expected to take control of the order paper and force through a bill to make the prime minister request an article 50 extension.</p> <p>In response, Johnson and his team plan to fight fire with fire. The Conservative leader today issued his MPs <a href=\"https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/political-parties/conservative-party/boris-johnson/news/106195/boris-johnson-warns-rebel\" title=\"\">an ultimatum</a>: back him or allow Jeremy Corbyn to take over and \u201cplunge the country into chaos\u201d. To hammer this point home even more assertively, dissenting Tory MPs could be threatened with deselection. No 10\u2019s aim is to present them with a simple choice: Johnson or Corbyn, making clear that the wrong decision will be career-ending.</p> <p>Downing Street remains bullish about being prepared for any turn of events. Johnson\u2019s director of legislative affairs, Nikki da Costa, has told querying colleagues that they have been preparing for this for two years. Insiders say there is an acceptance that things will get very hairy, but stress that every possible scenario has been war-gamed. \u201cWhile David Gauke has been taking photos on holiday with a unicorn inflatable, we have been working around the clock,\u201d says a government source. And a former minister who currently sits in the Gaukeward squad of anti-no deal MPs complains that it is difficult to anticipate how Cummings \u2013 who has written extensive blogs on strategy \u2013 will play it.</p> <p>However things play out this week, the dilemma for the anti-no deal Tories will remain much the same. The Conservative party under Johnson is set on a path that many cannot reconcile with their consciences. Even if MPs manage to legislate against a no-deal Brexit, Johnson will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/01/brexit-gove-refuses-rule-out-ignoring-law-passed-stop-no-deal-\" title=\"\">try to ignore it,</a> and if need be aim for a general election on a manifesto to leave the EU \u2013 deal or no deal.</p> <p>That idea is so toxic to some would-be rebels that talks are under way for a group of about 20 MPs to form a breakout party and stand as independent Conservatives. Other Tory MPs have lost the will to fight and are considering simply not seeking re-election.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f059fbcbcc7701617703d0237c140e9aa2e22dee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f059fbcbcc7701617703d0237c140e9aa2e22dee/0_158_3527_2116/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Politicians in Westminster, London, UK - 30 Aug 2019Mandatory Credit: Photo by James Veysey/REX/Shutterstock (10375108b) Dominic Cummings, special advisor to PM, arrives at Downing Street, London.

One former minister refers to it as \u201ca Vote Leave takeover\u201d. Many of those who worked on the leave campaign in the EU referendum now reside in Downing Street, but the growing Vote Leave influence extends well beyond.</p> <p>Aides who have found to be insufficiently committed to no deal have been blocked from returning to government; some of those who have made the cut describe a culture of fear. In Cummings\u2019s weekly meetings with aides, you\u2019re as likely to hear a no-deal Tory sceptic like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/07/dominic-cummings-takes-swipe-at-greive-over-confidence-vote-plan\" title=\"\">Dominic Grieve</a> or Philip Hammond criticised as you are a Labour politician.</p> <p>On the cabinet conference call to discuss prorogation, Amber Rudd raised concerns with Johnson about the aggressive tenor of the Brexit rhetoric coming from No 10. \u201cIt\u2019s actually scary how quickly they have managed to take control of so much,\u201d says a Tory source.</p> <p>The consequences of the new mindset are far reaching. Cummings\u2019s decision to sack Sajid Javid\u2019s aide <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/30/sajid-javid-was-not-told-in-advance-of-advisers-sacking-by-cummings\" title=\"\">without the chancellor\u2019s knowledge</a> has led to reports of tensions between No 10 and No 11. While both Javid and Johnson have played down any problems in their relationship, certain figures in No 10 regard Javid as a victim of Treasury group-think. Among this group, his Treasury colleague Rishi Sunak \u2013 the chief secretary to the treasury \u2013 is viewed as the more on-message of the pair.</p> <p>Expecting an imminent election, several cabinet ministers are keeping their heads down \u2013 worried that if Johnson returns with a majority and they have gone off piste they will be the next ones to be shown the door.</p> <p>Johnson allies play down the idea of an election being called as early as Thursday. Even if legislation is passed, Johnson and his team will probably make a few more attempts at getting round it. Any extra time for Downing Street to push its key messages is seen as a good thing. The crunch could come next month when few believe this government will manage to pass a Queen\u2019s speech as they have pledged to do in mid-October.</p> <p>The transformation that is going on within the Conservative party is matched by a change in electoral strategy. The voters Johnson and Cummings are prioritising in any early election are different from those David Cameron aimed for in 2015. The focus is on those who voted leave in the EU referendum. The first priority is to reunite the leave vote from the referendum and kill off the Brexit party. The seats the Tories would target are areas that voted heavily to leave \u2013 many of which are Labour/Tory marginals. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/02/lib-dem-victories-help-labour-waste-time-fighting\" title=\"\">Liberal Democrats</a> are viewed as a bigger concern for Labour \u2013 eating into the pro-EU vote.</p> <p>Already, Johnson is transforming the party he aspired to lead for so long. Retiring opponents of no deal are being replaced by devoted advocates of it \u2013 and even those who backed remain are seeking selection as \u201creformed remainers\u201d. The Conservatives are changing. According to one party source, \u201cThe candidates in a snap election will be Vote Leave mini-Mes.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/01/sheer-scale-of-crisis-facing-britains-constitution-has-been-laid-bare\">The sheer scale of the crisis facing Britain\u2019s decrepit constitution has been laid bare | Will Hutton</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The process could yet be thrown into reverse. The hope remains among some Johnson allies that an election will be held off until after the UK has left the EU. At that point, lots of the problems could go away. If there is no exit to argue about, there could be less intolerance towards anti-Brexit MPs and vice versa. \u201cIt would be more of a pacifying position,\u201d says a government insider.</p> <p>However, for many of the no-deal rebels, the party is shifting so far from the one they joined that they would struggle to lay this to rest in the event of a no-deal Brexit.</p> <p>The truth is that anti-no deal Tory MPs must now decide whether they can remain in a party that has shifted to be a party of leave. If the answer is no, this week is as good a time as any to find the door.</p> <p>\u2022 Katy Balls is the Spectator\u2019s deputy political editor</p>",

On Tuesday MPs are expected to take control of the order paper and force through a bill to make the prime minister request an article 50 extension. In response, Johnson and his team plan to fight fire with fire. The Conservative leader today issued his MPs an ultimatum: back him or allow Jeremy Corbyn to take over and \u201cplunge the country into chaos\u201d. To hammer this point home even more assertively, dissenting Tory MPs could be threatened with deselection. No 10\u2019s aim is to present them with a simple choice: Johnson or Corbyn, making clear that the wrong decision will be career-ending. Downing Street remains bullish about being prepared for any turn of events. Johnson\u2019s director of legislative affairs, Nikki da Costa, has told querying colleagues that they have been preparing for this for two years. Insiders say there is an acceptance that things will get very hairy, but stress that every possible scenario has been war-gamed. \u201cWhile David Gauke has been taking photos on holiday with a unicorn inflatable, we have been working around the clock,\u201d says a government source. And a former minister who currently sits in the Gaukeward squad of anti-no deal MPs complains that it is difficult to anticipate how Cummings \u2013 who has written extensive blogs on strategy \u2013 will play it. However things play out this week, the dilemma for the anti-no deal Tories will remain much the same. The Conservative party under Johnson is set on a path that many cannot reconcile with their consciences. Even if MPs manage to legislate against a no-deal Brexit, Johnson will try to ignore it, and if need be aim for a general election on a manifesto to leave the EU \u2013 deal or no deal. That idea is so toxic to some would-be rebels that talks are under way for a group of about 20 MPs to form a breakout party and stand as independent Conservatives. Other Tory MPs have lost the will to fight and are considering simply not seeking re-election. An ideological change is taking place across government and in the wider party. One former minister refers to it as \u201ca Vote Leave takeover\u201d. Many of those who worked on the leave campaign in the EU referendum now reside in Downing Street, but the growing Vote Leave influence extends well beyond. Aides who have found to be insufficiently committed to no deal have been blocked from returning to government; some of those who have made the cut describe a culture of fear. In Cummings\u2019s weekly meetings with aides, you\u2019re as likely to hear a no-deal Tory sceptic like Dominic Grieve or Philip Hammond criticised as you are a Labour politician. On the cabinet conference call to discuss prorogation, Amber Rudd raised concerns with Johnson about the aggressive tenor of the Brexit rhetoric coming from No 10. \u201cIt\u2019s actually scary how quickly they have managed to take control of so much,\u201d says a Tory source. The consequences of the new mindset are far reaching. Cummings\u2019s decision to sack Sajid Javid\u2019s aide without the chancellor\u2019s knowledge has led to reports of tensions between No 10 and No 11. While both Javid and Johnson have played down any problems in their relationship, certain figures in No 10 regard Javid as a victim of Treasury group-think. Among this group, his Treasury colleague Rishi Sunak \u2013 the chief secretary to the treasury \u2013 is viewed as the more on-message of the pair. Expecting an imminent election, several cabinet ministers are keeping their heads down \u2013 worried that if Johnson returns with a majority and they have gone off piste they will be the next ones to be shown the door. Johnson allies play down the idea of an election being called as early as Thursday. Even if legislation is passed, Johnson and his team will probably make a few more attempts at getting round it. Any extra time for Downing Street to push its key messages is seen as a good thing. The crunch could come next month when few believe this government will manage to pass a Queen\u2019s speech as they have pledged to do in mid-October. The transformation that is going on within the Conservative party is matched by a change in electoral strategy. The voters Johnson and Cummings are prioritising in any early election are different from those David Cameron aimed for in 2015. The focus is on those who voted leave in the EU referendum. The first priority is to reunite the leave vote from the referendum and kill off the Brexit party. The seats the Tories would target are areas that voted heavily to leave \u2013 many of which are Labour/Tory marginals. The Liberal Democrats are viewed as a bigger concern for Labour \u2013 eating into the pro-EU vote. Already, Johnson is transforming the party he aspired to lead for so long. Retiring opponents of no deal are being replaced by devoted advocates of it \u2013 and even those who backed remain are seeking selection as \u201creformed remainers\u201d. The Conservatives are changing. According to one party source, \u201cThe candidates in a snap election will be Vote Leave mini-Mes.\u201d The process could yet be thrown into reverse. The hope remains among some Johnson allies that an election will be held off until after the UK has left the EU. At that point, lots of the problems could go away. If there is no exit to argue about, there could be less intolerance towards anti-Brexit MPs and vice versa. \u201cIt would be more of a pacifying position,\u201d says a government insider. However, for many of the no-deal rebels, the party is shifting so far from the one they joined that they would struggle to lay this to rest in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The truth is that anti-no deal Tory MPs must now decide whether they can remain in a party that has shifted to be a party of leave. If the answer is no, this week is as good a time as any to find the door. \u2022 Katy Balls is the Spectator\u2019s deputy political editor",

      "bodyText": "A retired doctor who took part in non-violent environmental protests was visited by police at his home after his local NHS trust reported him to the government\u2019s counter-terrorism programme. Lyn Jenkins, 69, joined the Extinction Rebellion environmental campaign after he became convinced that urgent action was needed to avert climate breakdown. His local NHS trust referred him to Prevent, the government\u2019s flagship programme designed to stop people from becoming terrorists. Jenkins had sought help from the trust as he wanted to overcome his claustrophobia and believed he might experience panic attacks in a police cell if he was arrested. He had explicitly told the trust that he wanted to be arrested during Extinction Rebellion protests. Jenkins criticised Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust for referring him to the anti-terrorism programme when he was merely involved in a non-violent group that sought to raise awareness about the threat of climate chaos and could not in any way be considered a terrorist. He said: \u201cExtinction Rebellion is, above all, a non-violent movement. Labelling peaceful protesters as terrorists leaves them, and the world as a whole, in a more perilous position.\u201d A government source said Prevent decided a day after receiving the referral that no further action was needed. A police source suggested two officers had visited Jenkins at home to check on his wellbeing. The Prevent programme is the subject of an official review after years of criticism. The Home Office said the official aim of the programme was to stop vulnerable people from being drawn into committing or supporting terrorism. Employees working in public bodies such as NHS trusts, councils, schools and prisons are required by law to report any suspicions about possible terrorists to a local Prevent team, which then decides what action to take. Critics say the programme has become toxic because it is used to spy on Muslims and inhibits legitimate expression. Environmentalists have previously complained that they have been labelled as extremists under Prevent. Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust said it had referred Jenkins to Prevent as the programme\u2019s remit extended beyond terrorist activity. It said in a statement: \u201cWe have a responsibility to fulfil our safeguarding obligations to protect people who may be vulnerable to exploitation. There is a range of safeguarding matters on which we may seek advice, depending on the issue, whether that\u2019s child protection, domestic abuse or radicalisation. \u201cPrevent is part of the safeguarding programme, with a remit that extends beyond terrorist activity. If someone seeks treatment with us with the declared intention of enabling themselves to be arrested, that would prompt us to consider whether they were vulnerable or were being exploited by following the appropriate safeguarding process.\u201d The Home Office said: \u201cAll Prevent referrals are subject to a gateway assessment to ensure they are appropriate before any further action is taken.\u201d A Home Office source said government employees were not required to refer individuals involved in lawful non-violent protest to the Prevent programme. Thames Valley police declined to discuss why two of its officers had visited Jenkins at his home in Chesham, Buckinghamshire. It said: \u201cWhilst we do not discuss individual cases, it is important to note that information which is shared is assessed and a proportionate response is given. In some cases this response will be a welfare check on individuals by local neighbourhood officers.\u201d Jenkins said the police officers had asked if he was OK when they knocked on his door in May. He invited them in for what he described as a polite conversation during which he explained his plans to be arrested in an Extinction Rebellion protest. He said he had not been involved in political activity until he joined the movement last year. Jenkins has taken part in the group\u2019s protests. He intended at some stage to get arrested as he believed that it, coupled with non-violent civil disobedience, was the best way to bring about change. He has never been arrested. The trust treated him in four weekly sessions starting in March. He was shocked when he was told in April that it had referred him to Prevent. He had himself been trained in the programme when he worked in the NHS and saw it as being about stopping potential terrorists from being radicalised. He said the trust had told him that his name would remain on a list of people who had been referred to Prevent. The trust declined to comment. Jenkins says he still intends to be arrested in a future Extinction Rebellion protest.",

The same research found that 42% of small- to medium-sized businesses were still unsure of how they could prepare for Brexit and just a third of the British public have looked for information on what they will need to do, suggesting large-scale ignorance of what Brexit will involve with less than two months to go until the expected departure date. The Get Ready campaign, which shares its name with a song by the Temptations and an album by New Order, is likely to incorporate television, radio, newspaper and online adverts. Roadshows are expected to take place across the country, and online video tutorials are promised. According to the Times, a substantial order has been placed for branded mugs and T-shirts and there were claims that the government briefly considered reusing the Vote Leave slogan \u201ctake back control\u201d on the official campaign. Theresa May\u2019s administration spent relatively small amounts, measured in the hundreds of thousands of pounds, on publicly funded advertising campaigns supporting her abandoned withdrawal agreement in the run-up to the original Brexit deadline in March. Pro-Europe campaign groups have suggested the Get Ready campaign might not conform with government communications guidelines that ban adverts which could be construed as party political. Best for Britain\u2019s chairman, Lord Malloch-Brown, claimed the campaign could be seen as using public money to support a potential Conservative general election campaign. He said it was factually inaccurate to claim the UK was ready for a no-deal departure from the EU. \u201cThe argument that the government is ready for Brexit may be one of the defining issues for a general election campaign,\u201d said the pro-EU campaigner in his letter to cabinet secretary Mark Sedwill. \u201cIf the government\u2019s campaign starts before 31 October, then government advertising that makes this claim will effectively be supporting the governing party\u2019s re-election campaign.\u201d However, pro-Brexit campaigners have already drawn comparison with the millions spent on leaflets delivered to every house in the UK during the 2016 EU referendum by David Cameron\u2019s government in support of the remain campaign. This is not the first public information campaign called Get Ready for Brexit. Dutch port operators launched a website with the same name in January, suggesting foreign countries may have been doing their best to educate businesses on the risks of a disorderly Brexit for longer than the UK government.",

I spent the bank holiday on an English beach in the sun with two of my grandchildren, swimming, digging in the sand and sharing a picnic with friends. What\u2019s not to enjoy? If you\u2019re too inflexible to adapt to the wonderful world of children, then don\u2019t have them. Janet Kay Sheffield \u2022 I am struck by how tiring your writers find the care of their children during the holidays. \u201cAt the end of three weeks of unbroken time with my children, a treacherous part of me was looking forward to returning to my desk,\u201d says Emma Brockes (Journal, 31 August); \u201cYou have no holidays that are worthy of the name after having a child,\u201d says Lucy Mangan. Those of us in my generation who just got on with it day after day, year after year, were never credited with doing anything particularly onerous. We \u201cdidn\u2019t work\u201d. Jeanne Warren Garsington, Oxfordshire \u2022 While I have sympathy with Emma Brockes and Libby Brooks (Journal, 31 August) in their struggles to look after children and have good jobs, the articles were from a very middle-class position. The Guardian needs to do more to address the plight of women who are in a poverty trap, working two jobs, trying to look after their children, struggling to pay rent and buy food. Our bubble may be under threat, but their position is more desperate and we need to be talking about it.

The only way they\u2019re going to be taking me out of here is in the box.\u201d O\u2019Neill estimates that his landlord, JP McManus, has just 15 horses in the yard at the moment and sadly these do not include the talented Palmers Hill, still sidelined by injury. Other heavy hitters such as Trevor Hemmings and Gay Smith are represented, part of the widest non-JP team of owners that O\u2019Neill has had. They include Martin Tedham, chairman of the pharmaceutical packaging firm Wasdell Group, unveiled on Sunday as the new sponsor of O\u2019Neill\u2019s yard. Tedham went to \u00a3440,000 at an auction in April to buy the point to point winner Papa Tango Charly, who draws many admiring glances here. McManus was the underbidder. Other potential stars include Cloth Cap, whose aim is the Grand National, and Sky Pirate, whose target will be the BetVictor Gold Cup in November. The trainer also puts in a good word for the promising novice hurdler Arrivederci. \u201cWe\u2019ve got good owners and good support. All we need is a bit of luck and we\u2019re back on top again.\u201d",

In 2018 Toys R Us, Maplin and Poundworld disappeared as a result.</p>\n    <p>In terms of habits, shoppers are switching to buying online. The likes of Amazon have an unfair advantage because they have a lower business rate bill, which holds down costs and enables online retailers to woo shoppers with low prices. Business rates are taxes, based on the value of commercial property, that are imposed on traditional retailers with physical stores.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>At the same time, there is a move away from buying \u2018stuff\u2019 as more people live in smaller homes and rent rather than buy. Those pressures have come just as rising labour and product costs, partly fuelled by Brexit, have coincided with economic and political uncertainty that has dampened consumer confidence.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What help do retailers need?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Retailers with a high-street presence want the government to change business rates. They also want more political certainty as the potential for a no deal Brexit means some are not only incurring additional costs for stockpiling goods but are unsure about the impact of tariffs after October 2019. Retailers also want more investment in town centres to help them adapt to changing trends, as well as a cut to high parking charges which they say put off shoppers.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the government doing?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>In the October 2018 budget the government announced&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/oct/26/budget-to-offer-business-rates-relief-for-small-shops\">some relief</a>&nbsp;on business rates for independent shopkeepers. It has also set up a \u00a3675m \u2018future high streets\u2019 fund under which local councils can bid for up to \u00a325m towards regeneration projects such as refurbishing local historic buildings and improving transport links. The fund will also pay for the creation of a high street taskforce to provide expertise and hands-on support to local areas.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the outlook in 2019?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Some retailers could go under. Weakened by a difficult Christmas \u2013 which accounts for the entire annual profits of many retailers, and with further Brexit wobbles to come \u2013 retailers are facing a tough 2019. Another rise in the national minimum wage in April and the falling value of the pound against the dollar, which is used to buy goods in the far east, have also added to costs and hit profits.</p>\n    <p><br></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Arcadia has already started to untangle shared functions such as IT and HR to help the groundwork for a potential separation, according to the report.</p> \n<p>The move comes as Green\u2019s empire battles against declining sales and profitability as competition from online retailers grows, after years of underinvestment by the former billionaire.</p> \n<p>Employing about 17,000 with brands that have been household names on the high street for decades, Arcadia managed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jun/12/philip-green-arcadia-avoids-administration-as-rescue-deal-backed\">stave off collapse in June</a> after winning the backing of its creditors for a rescue plan that involved closing 50 of its 570 stores and 1,000 job losses.</p> \n<p>The plan involved seven company voluntary arrangements (CVAs) \u2013 insolvency procedures allowing businesses to renegotiate their debts \u2013 which required approval of 75% of all creditors and at least half of the landlords behind the company\u2019s shops.</p> \n<p>Arcadia had faced legal challenges in the US from two property groups contesting the outcome of some of its CVAs.

They make it clear that they don\u2019t like poetry. I tell them poetry comes in hundreds of different shapes, sizes, rhythms and moods; one way we can make poems is in a group and without writing anything down. For example, the people who are in charge of us in life have ways of showing they are fed up with us, angry with us, or through which they try to control us; punish us, even. What do such people say? I suggest they go into pairs and say these kinds of things to each other \u2013 in role, as parents, teachers, carers. We select the best lines. Then I say, can we create this into a scene? They suggest that all the lines should be said to just one of them sitting in a chair; the rest stand in a semicircle around him, and as they each say their line they point at the boy in the chair and then step back, while the semicircle repeats a chosen chorus.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/22/children-arts-ebacc-gcse\">Why are children forced to choose between the arts?

There should be a place for it in all schools, but it is becoming desperately difficult to find the time, staffing or resources to make it happen.</p> <p>Why? Because school means choices, and there are competing ideas about what school is for.

Capacity to compete has to be measured by putting in place tests at key moments throughout a person\u2019s school life so that by the end, school will disgorge a graded set of units \u2013 some of whom have this knowledge, and about a third of whom do not.</p> <p>One of the saddest consequences of this narrow approach to education is a decline in school students doing subjects with an arts dimension.

Israel\u2019s military said \u201ctwo or three anti-tank missiles\u201d had been fired from southern Lebanon toward an army base and a military ambulance but had caused no deaths or injuries.. Lt Col Jonathan Conricus, an army spokesman, also said Israel had fired back with approximately 100 artillery shells and that attack helicopters had also struck the area. The exchange \u201cwas most likely over\u201d, he said. Hezbollah, the pro-Iran Lebanese militant group, claimed the attack. It said its fighters had destroyed an Israeli army vehicle near the frontier in the same area. It said it had killed and wounded people inside, contradicting Israeli claims. It was not immediately clear if there had been casualties on the Lebanese side. Television channels in Israel said the army had ordered residents near the border to remain inside and for bomb shelters to be opened. Israeli forces along the frontier have been bracing all week for a possible attack by Hezbollah. The organisation\u2019s leadership accused Israel of attempting to attack it with two drones last Sunday in its stronghold of southern Beirut. Hezbollah\u2019s deputy leader had said his forces would launch a surprise retaliatory strike against Israel. \u201cI rule out that the atmosphere is one of war \u2013 it is one of a response to an attack,\u201d Sheikh Naim Qassem said in a TV interview on Tuesday night. \u201cEverything will be decided at its time.\u201d Israel has not claimed the Beirut strikes, but two western diplomats said the rare operation may have been an assassination attempt or an effort to destroy equipment for fitting advanced guidance systems to rudimentary rockets.

Catherine Deneuve plays an ailing French star who returns home for a tricky reconciliation with daughter Juliette Binoche, accompanied by her husband (Ethan Hawke) and young child.</p>\n    <p><b>Joker<br></b>Joaquin Phoenix is the cracked aspirant comedian in this drama from Todd Philips that\u2019s reportedly 80% King of Comedy to 20% The Dark Knight. Robert De Niro co-stars in what could well be the first comic book movie to bag a best picture Oscar.</p>\n    <p><b>Marriage Story<br></b>Noah Baumbach\u2019s latest is the story of a cross-coastal divorce starring Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson. Like his most recent film, The Meyerowitz Stories, this has been bankrolled by Netflix. Laura Dern, Alan Alda and Ray Liotta co-star as loved ones \u2013 and lawyers.</p>\n    <p><b>The King<br></b>Man of the moment Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet is Henry V in this lush, tough Shakespeare adaptation from David Mich\u00f4d.

Starring Jean Dujardin, it is based on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/27/robert-harris-an-officer-and-a-spy-dreyfus-affair-crime-writers-association-thriller\">the book by Robert Harris</a>.</p>\n    <p><b>The Perfect Candidate<br></b>Saudi Arabian director Haifaa Al-Mansour \u2013 one of only two women with films in competition \u2013 returns after the success of 2012\u2019s Wadjda with&nbsp; the tale of a young doctor who makes a bid for office in a municipal election.</p>\n    <p><b>Ad Astra<br></b>Brad Pitt follows in the footsteps of Sandra Bullock, Ryan Gosling and Matt Damon by heading into space in search of awards.

      "bodyText": "A system that allows problem gamblers to block themselves from all UK betting websites in one go has finally been approved by the industry regulator, 18 months after it was supposed to be ready, the Guardian understands. All gambling companies will be told to sign up to Gamstop, developed by the trade body for online casinos and bookmakers, as a condition of their licence to operate in the UK. The Gambling Commission, which regulates the industry, is expected to announce the requirement as soon as this week, after satisfying itself that concerns about the scheme\u2019s effectiveness have been dealt with. Earlier investigations, including by the Guardian, revealed flaws in the self-exclusion scheme which allowed problem gamblers to bypass self-imposed blocks. In May last year, five months after Gamstop\u2019s unofficial launch, the commission warned the industry trade body, the Remote Gambling Association (RGA), of specific failings in the system. The commission said it was concerned that Gamstop did not synchronise its list of registered users with companies\u2019 promotional mailing lists. This meant that addicts who signed up in an effort to curb their habit might still be bombarded with direct marketing emails. Such promotional emails have been a common feature of several regulatory rulings against gambling companies including Sky Bet and LeoVegas. In a letter obtained by the Guardian at the time, the commission\u2019s executive director, Tim Miller, said he was \u201cyet to see proper evidence of the effectiveness\u201d of Gamstop. He told the RGA that it was \u201cunacceptable that currently Gamstop does not interact with marketing lists in that way\u201d. Around 99% of gambling operators in the UK are understood to have committed themselves to using Gamstop already and those that do not will risk losing their licence to operate. Users of Gamstop, which is up and running but does not yet have the backing of the commission, are believed to number in their tens of thousands already. The Gambling Commission declined to comment on whether it was on the verge of approving Gamstop. \u201cWe have nothing further to announce on this at the moment,\u201d said a spokesperson. Official approval of GamStop comes amid a broader push by campaigners, the Labour party and even the commission itself to tighten up regulation of online gambling, after curbs were imposed on fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) in high street bookmakers. Measures under discussion include a ban on betting with credit cards. Labour has called for legislation to replace the Gambling Act 2005, put in place by Tony Blair\u2019s Labour government before an explosion of online casinos and bookmakers.",

      "bodyText": "And that\u2019s it from me. Thanks for your emails and tweets \u2013 I\u2019ll leave you with a nudge in this direction: Everton go fifth. Wolves remain winless. Second season syndrome? Europa League concerns? They are clearly a good side but will hope to find Chelsea\u2019s defence as accommodating as it recently has been when they next walk out at Molineux. This little slump needs nipping in the bud. It definitely is now! That\u2019s it \u2013 and a well deserved win for Everton, I\u2019d say. They controlled that second half despite Jimenez\u2019s equaliser. It\u2019s a second yellow for Boly to compound Wolves\u2019 afternoon. He charges Richarlison as the forward makes for the right corner flag and there can be no complaints. Nuno strokes his chin. He knows the game is up now. 90+4 min: Neto is booked for a foul on Richarlison and Everton are almost home ... 90+3 min: Everton win a left-sided corner and that will suit them just fine. Mina goes up, hoping for a cross. He doesn\u2019t get it. Everton work the ball back towards halfway and then dribble it back towards the other flank. 90+1 min: We will see five added minutes here. Can Wolves pull it out of the fire for a third time? They have form for stoppage-time goals ... ask Burnley. 89 min: A deep free-kick from Moutinho is headed out and then fed back in towards nobody by Traore. That\u2019s been a big disappointment in this half for Wolves \u2013 the fact that we haven\u2019t seen Traore at all. 86 min: Another fine save from Patricio now as Sigurdsson\u2019s corner is headed down by Mina. It\u2019s one-handed, again, and probably his best of the afternoon. He is keeping them in this. 84 min: That\u2019s dealt with and Everton try to spring a counter. It\u2019s wild and open out there now, once again. Wolves make a final change, Neves coming off and Pedro Neto on. 83 min: Another Bennett long throw. Can lightning strike twice? Nope, but a corner will result ... 82 min: So close to a hat-trick for Richarlison, who looks full of fun now. He chops inside from the right before aiming for the far corner and seeing Patricio save one-handed! They\u2019re ahead for a third time and it comes from a *magnificent* ball in from Digne. He runs down the left but seems to have run out of angles to put a good ball in. But he whips across an absolutely tantalising delivery from near the corner flag that arcs perfectly for Richarlison, steaming in, to leap above a static Boly and head superbly into the bottom corner! 77 min: Calvert-Lewin and Bernard immediately replace Iwobi and Kean. Jimenez needs treatment after taking such a whack in equalising, but is passed fit to carry on. Out of the blue! Wolves\u2019 long throws had come to very little all game, but this time Bennett puts one in from the left and Boly wins the flick-on. Jimenez rushes in bravely at the far post and heads past Pickford despite taking a boot in the face from Digne! It\u2019s 2-2, just when Wolves weren\u2019t really looking likely. 72 min: Digne fires an effort over via a deflection and Everton, still looking stronger here, have a corner. Mina brings it down and shoots, leading to the latest penalty claim as it pops off Bennett\u2019s knee and onto his hand at point-blank range. You can\u2019t give those. Although these days you sometimes do. 70 min: Kean loses a boot as he tries to get down the right and beat Boly but wins a free-kick in so doing. He\u2019s now found the snazzy pink boot; all is well. 68 min: Jota is good enough to give the away side a shot in the arm though. He comes on for Cutrone. 67 min: Neves is very lucky not to get a fifth booking for Wolves after going in from behind heavily on Sigurdsson. Everton are just that bit quicker to everything at this point. Europa League fatigue? 65 min: It\u2019s not been a sparkling second half so far but Everton have been the better side in it and Wolves, really, have not yet looked remotely like equalising. They need to perk up. 63 min: A yellow for Delph, now, after a late lunge on Jimenez, who has been quiet in this half. 61 min: Sigurdsson\u2019s latest delicious delivery is headed well over by the leaping Kean, who has made an all-action start to the half. 59 min: Bennett is booked \u2013 Wolves\u2019s fourth yellow card \u2013 for a tug on Digne. Saiss is, meanwhile, replaced by Moutinho. 57 min: Kean makes determined ground into the box, skinning Coady in doing so, but Bennett and Boly are both across quickly to prevent him getting a shot off. 56 min: Iwobi and Kean almost combine well but this is a slightly scruffy phase of midfield play at the moment. 53 min: Now a Wolves corner as we continue to rattle along pleasantly enough. Everton defend it well, as they have most of Wolves\u2019 set pieces so far. 52 min: Everton scream for a penalty as Coleman claims to have been tugged back by Saiss when running onto a nice clip from Sigurdsson. There did seem to be a faint touch by the Wolves man but there\u2019s no VAR check and no spot kick. 50 min: Another Bennett long throw for Wolves, and it\u2019s allowed to bounce and run out to the left side. Eventuallly Cutrone flashes in a ball that Rui Patricio grabs. 49 min: Boly is booked after quite blatantly checking Richarlison. Fast start to this half too. 48 min: And now some fine work from Sigurdsson almost tees Kean up in a far more dangerous position, but a defender gets there first. 47 min: Kean takes aim and has an early shot deflected behind. One thing Wolves did do well in the first half was offer him little space. The corner is eventually scrambled away. Will it get off to another flyer? Have a look at Ewan Murray\u2019s Old Firm derby match report here: Wolves get one last corner but it\u2019s no problem for Digne to defend. And that\u2019s the half. We had a helter-skelter start here, and a decent game thereafter too. Still a sense that there is all to play for here \u2013 do not go anywhere! 45+1 min: Traore burns past Digne again and Wolves really need to get him on the ball far more. This time his cross is straightforward for Pickford. 44 min: Jimenez is the next player to be booked, cheekily pulling Digne back as he tries to take a quick throw, the scamp. 43 min: A scrappy spell. Maybe everyone\u2019s looking to half-time. Bennett chucks in another long throw and Boly heads it on, but Mina defends. 41 min: JR in Illinois writes \u2013 \u201cCan you please explain VAR to me because I\u2019ve watched a replay of Everton\u2019s second goal multiple times and Sigurdsson is offside when he receives the ball before putting in the cross. And not just a little offside but clearly offside. They even stop the replay at the moment he is clearly offside. So offside that in real time I said \u2018No way that goal is going to stand. He was way offside\u2019. Did they even consult VAR? The announcers made no mention of it. I just don\u2019t understand.\u201d Now I must say this occurred to me too but everything was happening so quickly at that point, the thought only came fleetingly. It looked offside to me but I\u2019d have to see it from a different angle. I think I just assumed VAR would look after it if it was \u2013 which I still think will have been the case. 39 min: Vinagre is booked, quite rightly, for steaming in on Richarlison. 38 min: Delph does well to snick the ball from an unattended, and onside, Cutrone. The Italian\u2019s movement is clever. Wolves will definitely feel there is still something here for them. 35 min: Everton fizz the ball nicely around the box awhile, without really creating a chance. 33 min: Wolves mess up a short corner routine and a little spell of pressure goes begging. While we\u2019ve not built on that early goal rush it does look as if we should get another one or two here; it\u2019s open and entertaining fare. 30 min: Sigurdsson\u2019s radar is spot on today. Another whipped ball in sees a combination of Kean and a Wolves defender force Patricio to get down low and save at the near post. 28 min: Coady defends another Sigurdsson delivery superbly ahead of Kean. Mina meets the resulting corner but can\u2019t get enough power behind his header. 27 min: Digne has to go off and get a bloodied mouth patched up, which took some time to organise. 25 min: And that is \u2013 again \u2013 almost 2-2. Vinagre does brilliantly down the left and his cross ricochets off Mina. Cutrone has another chance to shoot and it\u2019s on target ... but strikes Keane (I think) and flies behind! 24 min: Jimenez is next to have a go, cutting in from the left and drilling low but forcing a similarly comfortable stop. Wolves seem to have sorted things out a bit, albeit belatedly. 23 min: Wolves win a free-kick in exactly the same position as a few minutes ago. Can Neves find an away head? No, but when the ball is played back in by a teammate Saiss aims a header straight at Pickford. This is a great stat. 20 min: The free-kick is cleared and Richarlison, after a couple of minutes\u2019 work on his ankle, is back on. That was the first lull of the game! 18 min: Digne hauls Traore back and in the meantime Richarlison needs treatment after an earlier tumble. 16 min: Now Everton back off Cutrone but his shot from range flashes well wide. Feels like it! 15 min: Now Coleman gets in on the act, almost working a clear shot before it\u2019s blocked at the last. Wolves look unusually ragged. 14 min: It\u2019s very nearly 2-2 as Pickford saves superbly from Cutrone, parrying around the post after Everton never quite clear a corner and the striker is found at the back stick. He claims the resulting flag kick. This has been a sensational start. What on earth is going on? This is a fine goal, a *just onside* Sigurdsson getting away down the right and arrowing in an absolutely splendid cross that Iwobi, craning his neck, heads past Patricio superbly! It\u2019s 2-1 to the hosts already! 10 min: Certainly not sure I was expecting two early goals here but we\u2019re set fair for a belter now, hopefully. Iwobi claims a penalty but Bennett got a vital touch on the ball. What a start here! Traore, the speedster, beats Digne to a long ball and then does brilliantly to skin him on the right flank, leaving him for dead and drilling a low centre that Pickford can\u2019t get a finger on. It hits the unlucky, unsighted Coleman and falls for Saiss to jab home! That\u2019s a fine finish but a disaster from Wolves. Coady and Patricio get into a mess, the keeper coming to clear the ball but Coady insisting on passing back to him as he rushes out. It means Patricio has to, effectively, make a desperate save with his foot. The ball pings out, strikes Kean, and runs for the onrushing Richarlison \u2013 who still has it all to do but lashes supebly into the goal! 4 min: Good move from Everton there though, Digne finding Iwobi, who checks back onto his right foot and crosses well for Sigurdsson \u2013 who gets up but directs his header a foot or two over the bar. 3 min: Wolves start fairly well and hurl an early long throw into the Everton box, but Keane is there to defend it. They\u2019re in the old gold and black, Everton in blue and white. David Cross writes: \u201cArrived in San Francisco last night so obviously can\u2019t sleep properly yet. Will enjoy this match with you while eating an early breakfast. Prediction is that Bernard will come on late with fresh legs and score or make the winner.\u201d Enjoy your brekkie, David! OK, the teams are ready to emerge at Goodison \u2013 it\u2019s nearly time to get started ... Marco Silva (is he any good or not? We still don\u2019t know) speaks: \u201cEvery time we change something we expect a good answer for the players. It\u2019s more about collective work than one or two players, we have to create chances as a team for them to score goals. The last game was not what we expect, not the best game for us, but the first 25 minutes of how we started against Villa is how we have to start here. We always want more, me as a manager and we as a club, and this afternoon is a good opportunity for us to get three points.\u201d Not a brilliant omen. While we savour all that, join Alex Hess for the rest of Rangers v Celtic. The Bhoys currently lead the Old Firm derby 1-0! Yes, Kean and Iwobi start. So does Delph. Calvert-Lewin, Schneiderlin and Bernard are the benched casualties of the no-show at Villa Park. Wolves rotate, of course, after Thursday\u2019s win over Torino. Bennett, Vinaigre, Neves and Cutrone all come in; Matt Doherty is out injured. Everton: Pickford, Coleman, Keane, Mina, Digne, Andre Gomes, Delph, Richarlison, Sigurdsson, Iwobi, Kean. Subs: Holgate, Calvert-Lewin, Tosun, Schneiderlin, Sidibe, Bernard, Stekelenburg. Wolves: Rui Patricio, Bennett, Coady, Boly, Traore, Dendoncker, Neves, Saiss, Ruben Vinagre, Jimenez, Cutrone. Subs: Vallejo, Pedro Neto, Gibbs-White, Jota, Jonny, Ruddy, Joao Moutinho. Referee: Anthony Taylor Here\u2019s your appetiser for the north London derby \u2013 or your main if you support either of these two \u2013 and it\u2019s not a bad one. It\u2019s a bit like having a lovely plate of seared scallops before you get onto the steak; there\u2019s every chance it could be the highlight of the meal. It\u2019s a clash of the upper-middle, the hopefuls who think they can put pressure on the established top-six order, two serious teams with serious managers and some serious talent on the pitch too. It\u2019s only flickered so far. Wolves have three draws from three and that\u2019s fine, but a win here would prove there\u2019s nothing to worry about in terms of Europa League hangovers and so forth. Everton began well but were very disappointing in their defeat at Aston Villa \u2013 I wonder if we\u2019ll see more of Moise Kean and Alex Iwobi, who both livened things up there and starred in the League Cup win at Lincoln, today. We\u2019ll find out shortly! Team news and much more coming up. It should be a good, tight, entertaining battle, this one. Send in your tweets and emails too \u2013 I want to hear your thoughts on both teams\u2019 activities this season to date.",

      "bodyText": "It is the peak of hurricane season in Florida, the days and weeks in which the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) might at any time alert Floridians to a weather system spinning our way. And so, this week, the name \u201cDorian\u201d arrived on our lips. TV stations pulled out the red blender blade logo reserved for hurricanes, the slalom runs of predicted paths splayed across maps of the western Atlantic. Anxiety levels rose with each National Hurricane Center (NHC) update: 5am, 8am, 11am, 2pm, 5pm, 11pm, over and over again, position, wind speed, rate of travel and course analyzed round the clock by excited meteorologists. The message? Don\u2019t tell us we didn\u2019t warn you. There is something of the game show about it all. Spin the wheel! Which box has the prize? Five days out, Dorian seemed destined to hit Miami. Then it shifted, supposedly barreling down on opulent Palm Beach. Up and down the eastern coast, preparations were ramped up: canals were pumped out, windows shuttered, boats moved to storage. The worst storm in decades might be about to blast us all raw and deluge the coast with 10ft of storm surge and 15in of rain.

My prayers and thoughts are with you and your family today. If a single one of you watching and enjoying this sport think for a second what we do is safe your hugely mistaken. All these drivers put their life on the line when they hit the track and people need to appreciate that in a serious way because it is not appreciated enough.

      "bodyText": "Right, thanks for your company. The final word should go to race winner Charles Leclerc, who dedicated his first F1 victory to Anthoine Hubert, who tragically died on Saturday: On one hand, I\u2019ve got a dream since being a child that has been realised but on the other hand, it has been a very difficult weekend and we have lost a friend first of all. It is very difficult in these situations. I would like to dedicate my first win to him, we have grown up together \u2013 my first ever race was with Anthoine \u2013 and it is just such a shame what happened. I can\u2019t enjoy fully my first victory but I will keep this memory forever. 1 Leclerc 2 Hamilton 3 Bottas 4 Vettel 5 Albon 6 P\u00e9rez 7 Kvyat 8 H\u00fclkenberg 9 Gasly 10 Stroll 11 Magnussen 12 Grosjean 13 Ricciardo 14 Russell 15 R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen 16 Kubica NC Norris NC Giovanazzi NC Sainz Jr NC Verstappen The victorious Charles Leclerc, understandably, cuts an extremely emotional figure up on the podium. After collecting his trophy following his first Formula One win, the national anthems ring out in Spa and cue some muted champagne celebrations. Rest in peace, Anthoine Hubert is very much the message from Leclerc. Lewis Hamilton reacts after finishing second. \u201cI gave it absolutely everything,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was a really difficult race \u2013 the Ferraris are just too fast in this race \u2013 and we needed a few more laps in the end. Congratulations to Charles on his first win, it\u2019s been coming all year.\u201d Valtteri Bottas, who finished in third, adds: \u201cThere was no chance for me [to win] but I was trying as hard as I could.\u201d For Leclerc, it is time to head out and celebrate on the podium. Charles Leclerc steps out of his Ferrari and points to the sky. And he speaks so, so well, as he dedicates his first career win to Anthoine Hubert. \u201cOn one hand, I\u2019ve got a dream since being a child that has been realised but on the other hand, we have lost a friend first of all and it\u2019s very difficult in these situations,\u201d Leclerc says. \u201cI would like to dedicate my first win to him, we have grown up together \u2013 my first ever race was with Anthoine \u2013 and it is just such a shame what happened yesterday. I can\u2019t enjoy fully my first victory but I will keep this memory forever.\u201d \u201cYes!\u201d shouts Leclerc down the team radio. \u201cIt feels good but it\u2019s difficult to enjoy it on a weekend like this. But thanks for everything guys.\u201d Meanwhile, Alex Albon finishes fifth on his Red Bull debut. Disaster for Lando Norris at the end of the crescendo of that race, as he plummeted down the grid. He was on for a fifth-placed finish but ended up breaking down on the grass. The Ferrari holds on, Lewis Hamilton\u2019s second, Bottas third. Lap 44/44: Giovinazzi crashes out \u2013 but he\u2019s absolutely fine. Lap 44/44: Here we go! Can Leclerc hold on? Lap 43/44: Hamilton is eating away at Leclerc. The Ferrari leads \u2013 but his lead is dwindling. Hamilton trails by just 1.6secs ... we\u2019re in for a big finish! Hamilton is not going down without a fight. Lap 43/44: Leclerc leads Hamilton by 2.1secs \u2013 the Mercedes is going nowhere just yet. He\u2019s hungry and the Ferrari can see Hamilton in his mirrors ... Lap 42/44: The back markers are bogging Leclerc down as Hamilton makes light work of clearing the Haas\u2019. Two-and-a-half laps or so to go but a last-lap showdown looks increasingly likely, with Hamilton closing the gap, whittling it down to just 2.3secs. Lap 41/44: Lance Stroll nips ahead of Romain Grosjean and into 13th. It\u2019s not over out in front, with the gap closing between Hamilton and Leclerc. Had Vettel not have sapped some of Hamilton\u2019s earlier pace, the Mercedes would surely be on the Frenchman\u2019s tail. Leclerc leads by three seconds ... Lap 40/44: Five laps to go! Lap 39/44: Leclerc leads Hamilton by 5.9secs. Lap 37/44: Twelth-placed Romain Grosjean is told by Haas that he could get in and among the points \u2013 but he\u2019s having none of it. He says they have no chance with this pace, bogged down by carrying too much drag. Meanwhile, Albon zooms into seventh after nipping ahead of Daniil Kvyat. Out in front, Hamilton is beginning to run out of laps and is at least trying to turn the screw. Can he? Lap 36/44: Vettel\u2019s race has gone to pot. The German, who has not won a race since Spa last year, trails third-placed Bottas by 18secs after going wide. It\u2019s surely a two-horse race for the win, with Leclerc leading Hamilton by 6.6secs. Lap 35/44: Albon earns a roaring applause down in the paddock after breezing beyond a sluggish Daniel Ricciardo, whose had had a torrid time. Red Bull do have something to cheer, after all. Verstappen retired on lap one. Lap 34/44: Leclerc leads Hamilton by 7.1secs. Lap 33/44: Vettel re-pits. He has no intentions of getting into a squabble with Valtteri Bottas but now he has a chance to apply the hammer late on. Leclerc continues to lead Hamilton. Lap 32/44: Hamilton pulls ahead of Vettel! Hamilton zooms into second and the Ferrari was powerless to prevent the Mercedes flying past him. Game on: Leclerc v Hamilton, who trails the race leader by 6.3secs. The Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff clenches his fist; he looks a very happy man back in the paddock. Lap 31/44: Mercedes ask Bottas to help out his team-mate Hamilton. \u201cKeep your tyres in good nick\u201d is the message down the team radio. Hamilton must fancy his chances of toppling Vettel, who is wobbling, slowing on the track. They go wheel-to-wheel into turn 19 but Vettel prospers out of La Source. Lap 30/44: Hamilton says his \u201crears are on fire\u201d but Mercedes reassure him that Vettel\u2019s tyres are overheating just as much. Leclerc leads Vettel by 4.8secs, and maybe they will try and keep the German out on track as long as possible to help the race leader open up a bigger lead. Hamilton is 0.4secs behind Vettel. Lap 29/44: Vettel is cagey about Ferrari calling him back in. Hamilton\u2019s renewed pace could yet eat up both of the Ferraris. Hamilton\u2019s on the hunt, slowly shaving Vettel\u2019s advantage. Lap 28/44: Plan B for Vettel? The Ferrari driver is told his tyres will not last until the end and he\u2019ll have to come in for another set of tyres. That\u2019s good news for Mercedes and Hamilton, who has picked up the pace, as has Bottas. Lap 27/44: Vettel is briefed to let Leclerc past him. Ferrari remain in control, with a new-look one-two. Vettel benefits from the DRS and things are looking good. Lap 26/44: Bottas sets a slick new fastest lap of 1.46. Lap 25/44: Vettel leads Leclerc by 2.1secs. Hamilton trails the Frenchman by 6.7secs. Vettel\u2019s pace has killed Mercedes\u2019 optimism. Lap 24/44: Hamilton does not seem too happy about the Mercedes strategy here. He clearly feels they were too slow to react to Ferrari blinking first. Bottas\u2019s stop is quick, which is handy as he comes out in fourth behind his team-mate. Charles Leclerc has just set a new fastest lap. Vettel leads. Lap 23/44: Hamilton\u2019s pit-stop is not Mercedes\u2019 finest \u2013 it was a little sluggish, with Ferrari yielding a second or so on his car, owing to a problem with the left-rear. Down the team radio, Bottas is told to give it everything he\u2019s got, to put the hammer down ... but then box. How will Mercedes look after this? The mediums are on. Lap 22/44: Lewis Hamilton is the new race leader. Leclerc nips out of the pits \u2013 and it was a lightning stop \u2013 in fourth, behind Sebastian Vettel. The Ferraris are on fresh medium tyres, while Mercedes remain on the softs. And now Hamilton is told to box ... Lap 21/44: The top three are yet to pit as we approach the halfway stage. But, hang on a minute, Leclerc is told to box down the team radio. Ferrari get ready to receive. Things are about to hot up ... Lap 20/44: Down in 13th, Nico H\u00fclkenberg skips in front of Kevin Magnussen. Kubica is the back marker, Leclerc the race leader. Lap 19/44: A fitting standing ovation and a round of applause on lap 19, in tribute to Anthoine Hubert, whose Arden car was the No 19. On the track, Vettel continues to boss things, dictating the pace from fourth as he racks up another fastest lap. Lando Norris, meanwhile, pits. Leclerc leads Hamilton by 4.3secs. Lap 18/44: Mercedes are seemingly playing the long game. Hamilton remains out on track, four seconds behind race leader Charles Leclerc. Vettel is ripping it up. Lap 17/44: Hamilton soldiers on for another lap. Vettel, on the mediums, is building his pace and passes Norris. The Ferrari is flying round Spa. Romain Grosjean is the latest to pit. Lap 16/44: And now Vettel pits \u2013 he\u2019s in and out in no time, stopping for just 2.5 secs \u2013 and the Ferrari sprints out into fifth, behind Lando Norris. Vettel blinks first, then, while Sergio P\u00e9rez soon follows. Leclerc leads Hamilton. Lap 15/44: Albon\u2019s Red Bull dives down the inside of Kevin Magnussen and he jumps into 10th. Gasly\u2019s pit-stop has triggered more drivers to come in and seek attention, with Lance Stroll the latest to pop in for some fresh tyres. Lap 13/44: Leclerc is ramping things up, with the Ferrari racking up a 1.49.917, a new fastest lap. Between Leclerc and Vettel, who now trails the race leader by more than three seconds, they are taking it in turns to step on the gas. Meanwhile, Gasly pits. Lap 12/44: Eighteen drivers remain at Spa, with Sainz Jr retiring as a result of power-related problems and Max Verstappen clashing with R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen at La Source on an eventful first lap. \u201cIt was a poor start, I don\u2019t really know why,\u201d says Verstappen. \u201cFrom then onwards, I just braked maybe a little later than the two cars ahead of me and Kimi probably didn\u2019t expect me to be there.\u201d Lap 11/44: No investigation necessary is the verdict from the FIA regarding that Leclerc error. The Ferrari leads Vettel by 2.6secs, with Hamilton in third followed by his Mercedes team-mate Valtteri Bottas. Then it\u2019s Lando Norris in fifth. Lap 10/44: Hamilton says \u201cVettel\u2019s struggling\u201d. He smells blood in Vettel, who is still a second in front of the Englishman. Still, that is music to the ears of the Mercedes team back at the paddock. Meanwhile, the FIA say they have taken note of a turn 5 incident involving Charles Leclerc, who went off wide a moment ago. The Ferrari is unlikely to be penalised because he gained no advantage. Lap 9/44: Leclerc is beginning to stretch his legs. The Frenchman leads Sebastian Vettel by 2.2secs. Leclerc was guilty of locking up into a corner a moment ago and Hamilton is having a good go at closing the gap to Vettel out of La Source. Lap 7/44: Leclerc leads Vettel, who has just set a new fastest lap of 1.49.459, by 1.9secs. Maybe Vettel is not as sluggish as Hamilton is making out. Down in seventh, Kevin Magnussen is doing a sterling job of batting away P\u00e9rez, with Gasly still close for company. Lap 6/44: Magnussen, Sergio P\u00e9rez and Pierre Gasly are wrestling for seventh, with the former currently leading that pack. Down the radio, Lewis Hamilton seems pretty chirpy. \u201cVettel\u2019s not that quick,\u201d says the Mercedes driver. His team concur, admitting the Ferrari\u2019s straight-line speeds are not too impressive. Lap 5/44: Vettel locks up going into the La Source but gets away with it, although surely the Ferrari has ceded some ground on third-placed Lewis Hamilton. Leclerc is out in front by 1.8secs. Bottas trails Hamilton by around 4secs. A word on Lando Norris, who has climbed up to fifth from 11th after a lightning start. Lap 4/44: The safety car is still plodding along out in front, followed by Charles Leclerc, Sebastian Vettel, Lewis Hamilton and Valtteri Bottas. Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen has assumed the role of back marker following that early collision with Verstappen. Lap 3/44: The safety car remains out on track, with Carlos Sainz Jr down and out having twice stalled. An unhappy 25th birthday for the Spaniard and McLaren. Verstappen\u2019s race is also run, much to the disappointment of hundreds of orange-clad Dutch supporters who have popped over the border. Lap 2/44: A nightmare start for Max Verstappen, whose race is over before it even began. R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen plunges down the grid, popping into the pits but comes away unscathed. Meanwhile, Daniel Ricciardo has also pitted. There is not a lot of room for manoeuvre and Verstappen is an early victim of a helter-skelter start in Spa. Behind the safety car, Leclerc leads from Ferrari team-mate Sebastian Vettel. It has not been a dull few minutes. Max Verstappen is out of the race and the safety car is deployed. Big audible groans from the home crowd in Spa, gutted at seeing their man bow out following a clash with Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen. It was a messy start. Down at the front, Charles Leclerc leads Vettel, who is already under the cosh, with Lewis Hamilton breathing down his neck. Great start by Albon, but Sainz Jr stalls on the grid. Three minutes until the off at Spa-Francorchamps! We are a formation lap or so away from the off at the Belgian GP. Truly heartbreaking scenes at Spa; a very moving minute\u2019s silence has been and gone, followed by a ripple of applause and the Belgian national anthem. \u201cHe was such a talented driver, it\u2019s a shame for all of us,\u201d says Lando Norris. \u201cEveryone will tribute their race today to Anthoine, to his family and friends. It\u2019s not a nice day.\u201d Sergio P\u00e9rez, who starts from seventh, adds: \u201cThe last thing we wanted to do today was go out and race,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are not in the best mood, the whole [racing] community but let\u2019s go and do our best, because it\u2019s what he deserves.\u201d A gentle reminder that Lewis Hamilton is way out in front in the drivers\u2019 standings, ahead of Mercedes team-mate Valtteri Bottas and the Red Bull of Max Verstappen. Ferrari remain winless this season but Charles Leclerc starts on pole and the young Monacan is alongside Sebastian Vettel on the front row of the grid. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect to have the year that I\u2019ve had,\u201d Hamilton says. \u201cIt\u2019s been absolutely phenomenal and I\u2019ve been enjoying it more than ever.\u201d The F1 family continue to pay tribute to Anthoine Hubert, with the liveries of all of the cars carrying special markers out of respect: A poignant driver\u2019s parade in Spa: There will be a minute\u2019s silence at Spa. It will be in remembrance of Anthoine Hubert, the 22-year-old who was tragically killed in a F2 crash on Saturday. It will take place before the Belgian national anthem that precedes the GP is played out. The FIA is providing support to the event organisers and the relevant authorities, and has commenced an investigation into the incident. 1 Leclerc 2 Vettel 3 Hamilton 4 Bottas 5 Verstappen 6 R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen 7 P\u00e9rez 8 Magnussen 9 Grosjean 10 Ricciardo 11 Norris 12 H\u00fclkenberg 13 Giovinazzi 14 Gasly 15 Russell 16 Sainz Jr 17 Stroll 18 Albon 19 Kvyat 20 Kubica First thing\u2019s first: all thoughts with the family and friends of Anthoine Hubert, who was killed in a crash at Spa-Francorchamps on Saturday. The Formula 2 driver died in Liege hospital, where he was taken following a collision at around 170mph with Juan-Manuel Correa, who remains in intensive care following surgery. The mood around Spa will inevitably be sombre as F1 takes centre stage, with Charles Leclerc on pole after beating his Ferrari team-mate Sebastian Vettel in qualifying. Lewis Hamilton begins from third, with Max Verstappen in fourth. But the events that followed qualifying have understandably overshadowed the Belgian Grand Prix weekend. Fernando Alonso said: \u201cI have no words. It hurts the heart. Rest in peace, champ.\u201d In a message posted on Instagram, Hamilton said: \u201cThis is devastating. God rest your soul Anthoine. My prayers and thoughts are with you and your family today. If a single one of you watching and enjoying this sport think for a second what we do is safe your hugely mistaken. All these drivers put their life on the line when they hit the track and people need to appreciate that in a serious way because it is not appreciated enough. Not from the fans nor some of the people actually working in the sport. Anthoine is a hero as far as I\u2019m concerned, for taking the risk he did to chase his dreams. I\u2019m so sad that this has happened. Let\u2019s left him up and remember him. Rest in peace.\u201d Lights out: 2.10pm (BST)",

      "bodyText": "Hundreds of visitors who were stranded on the Isles of Scilly for days after the only passenger ferry broke down were expecting to finally return to the mainland on Sunday. Around 800 people have been waiting to return from the archipelago \u2013 located about 27 miles south-west of Land\u2019s End in Cornwall \u2013 after the only ferry broke down on Wednesday morning. Two engines on the Scillonian III \u2013 the only regular service to the islands by sea \u2013 started to fail, and the boat was escorted back to Penzance by the RNLI. The Scillonian III has a passenger capacity of 485 and usually completes a return trip once a day between Penzance and the largest of the islands, St Mary\u2019s. Isles of Scilly Travel, who operate the ferry and also run passenger flights to the islands, said the boat would be back in action on Sunday afternoon with its first voyage after being repaired scheduled for 3.30pm. Georgina Gracey, who was on the boat when it broke down, said passengers were given limited information by the company when the engines failed. She added: \u201c(It) bobbed up and down three miles off Land\u2019s End for about an hour before the engineers managed to fix one engine and we turned back to Penzance. \u201cThe main priority was sorting out accommodation for people who were stranded, but there was very little information given about onwards travel.\u201d Some passengers, including Gracey, were flown out to the island the next day. However, others who were already on the island remained stranded. There have been growing frustrations towards the company after claims from some holidaymakers that they were not given adequate information. Gracey, 20, who holidays on the islands with her family every year, said the company were far more responsive if contacted via Twitter than via phone or email. She added: \u201cAt first it was so frustrating having virtually no information, but once we spoke to someone on Wednesday night he was very helpful and sorted out our travel very quickly. \u201cI think this is a super-unprecedented situation for the islands so I think they\u2019ve tried their best.

      "body": "<p>Hans Rausing, who has died aged 93, became a billionaire through the Tetra Pak drinks packaging enterprise. He deposed the Queen from the top of Britain\u2019s rich list many years ago but told an interviewer: \u201cI am an industrialist. I understand machinery. I understand things. I do not understand money. I have no idea how much money I have.\u201d Forbes magazine, though, calculated that he was the world\u2019s 112th richest person, with a net worth of $12bn built on the Tetra Pak fortune that he and his brother <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2000/02/08/business/gad-rausing-77-swedish-innovator-of-beverage-containers.html\" title=\"\">Gad</a> inherited from their father, Ruben, in 1983.</p> <p>The Tetra Pak empire began in a kitchen in Lund, Sk\u00e5ne, in Sweden\u2019s dairy heartland, in 1944. Ruben Rausing was watching his wife, Elisabeth (nee Varenius), make sausages, pinching the ends shut. That gave him the idea for a sealed triangular pouch that could be a germ-free means of storing milk. Along with a research scientist, Erik Wallenberg, Ruben developed the idea into a rectangular cardboard carton for storing milk, juice, yoghurt and ice-cream. \u201cThe object was to construct a package that would be free from leakage without any special tightening process before being filled,\u201d Wallenberg said. Ruben bought the patent and all rights from Wallenberg for less than \u00a3300.</p> <p>By 1952 the first Tetra Pak containers were successfully produced and in a few years Ruben had amassed a business that included bank-note dispensers, water purifiers and paper mills. He brought all his three sons into the family business \u2013 the eldest, Gad, was a chemist, the youngest, Sven, a linguist. It was the middle son, Hans, though, who was the chosen one.</p> <p>Hans, born in Gothenburg, went to the cathedral school in Lund before going on to study economics, statistics and Russian at Lund University, and then following his father\u2019s path to study in the US. \u201c\u2018He was,\u201d Wallenberg recalled, \u201cextremely able and, like his father, single-minded. He believed he was the perfect salesman. I once heard him say he could sell air or water.\u201d</p> <p>From 1950 to 1995 Hans held roles as chief executive and chairman of Tetra Pak, while Gad served initially as deputy managing director. Hans was responsible for Tetra Pak breaking into the Soviet Union, where it became the biggest foreign employer. Today 137bn patented Tetra Paks are sold each year. The Rausings\u2019 success helps explain why early morning Britain no longer rings to the clink of milk bottles.</p> <p>If Hans claimed not to understand money, he and Gad were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/apr/11/politics.economy\" title=\"\">financially astute</a> enough to leave Sweden for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/apr/08/margaret-thatcher-political-phenomenon-dies\" title=\"\">Thatcher</a>\u2019s Britain in 1982 to avoid high taxes. Gad bought a vast house in Holland Park, London; Hans purchased a 900-acre estate in the village of Wadhurst in East Sussex where he lived with his wife, M\u00e4rit (nee Norrby), whom he married in 1958, and their three children, Lisbet, Sigrid and Hans Kristian.</p> <p>There the Rausings designed and built, with the architect <a href=\"http://www.johnoutram.com/projectsmenu.html\" title=\"\">John Outram</a>, a terrazzo and steel one-storey building that he named the New House. At Wadhurst, he raised one of Europe\u2019s largest herds of deer. He also owned a 600-acre wild boar farm in Tenterden, Kent.</p> <p>Those few journalists invited to Wadhurst Park found the man who topped Britain\u2019s rich list in 1983 humbly squeezing his 6ft 8in frame into a Morris Minor to drive around the estate. Dominic Lawson called him \u201cthe Greta Garbo of business\u201d. Both Hans and Gad eschewed gossip columns and parties.</p> <p>Business journalists struggled, too, to penetrate the Rausings\u2019 empire. Because it was a private company controlled through a Liechtenstein foundation and a Dutch holding group, the firm could avoid publishing annual reports or accounts. In 1991, though, Tetra Pak bought the Swedish agricultural, engineering and food processing group <a href=\"https://www.alfalaval.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Alfa Laval</a> for \u00a31.5bn.</p> <p>Though fabulously wealthy, with homes in Sweden, London and Barbados, Hans deprecated the high life: \u201cEither you have 20 mistresses covered with diamonds and a Mercedes 500, or you achieve something with your money. For me it is a passion to try to develop and create industry in different ways.\u201d</p> <p>In 1995 Hans sold his share of Tetra Laval to Gad for an estimated $7bn. In 2001, though, he was back in business <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2001/aug/05/theobserver.observerbusiness12\" title=\"\">launching a successor packaging venture, EcoLean</a>, with a container made of about 60% chalk and 40% natural gas. What looked like sibling rivalry to create another multibillion pound packaging business, was rather, Hans claimed, \u201cecologically perfect\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cNobody else has, so far as I know, imitated an eggshell before, but this is basically an eggshell, only not brittle,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen the product is disposed of, it becomes brittle in sunlight and after a month or so it just disintegrates into sand.\u201d Today <a href=\"https://www.ecolean.com/\" title=\"\">EcoLean</a>, based in Sk\u00e5ne, has operations in 30 countries.</p> <p>In 2006 Rausing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2006/apr/24/uk.foreignpolicy\" title=\"\">received an honorary knighthood</a> in recognition of his philanthropic services. These included a donation of \u00a32.5m to Cambridge University for a maths centre in 1997. His Hans Rausing <a href=\"https://www.eldp.net/\" title=\"\">Endangered Languages</a> Project at the University of London supports research, training and archiving of disappearing languages. In 2004, among other <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2006/jul/02/uk.conservatives1\" title=\"\">donations to the Conservative party</a>, he gave \u00a3198,000 as Michael Howard sought funds to fight the 2005 election.</p> <p>His children, who described Rausing as \u201ca loving father and devoted family man\u201d, followed their father in philanthropy. The total value of his family\u2019s donations since 1998 has exceeded \u00a31bn, funding medical research, as well as cultural and environmental projects.</p> <p>Sigrid has written of inheriting great wealth that: \u201cThe pros \u2026 I believe, are largely illusory and can become pathological. An illusory sense of being special and different, the assumption that one is interesting to other people only, or mainly, because of the money and subsequent feelings of isolation.\u201d</p> <p>In 2017 she published a memoir, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/sep/07/mayhem-by-sigrid-rausing-review\" title=\"\">Mayhem</a>, focused on the story of her brother, who became a drug addict in his 20s, and his wife <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/eva-rausing\" title=\"\">Eva</a>, whom he met in an American rehab clinic, and who was found dead at their home in London in July 2012. She had died two months earlier from what the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/dec/14/eva-rausing-died-cocaine-abuse\" title=\"\">coroner</a> called the effects of cocaine on a damaged heart. </p> <p>Hans is survived by M\u00e4rit, their children and seven grandchildren.</p> <p>\u2022 Hans Rausing, entrepreneur and philanthropist, born 25 March 1926; died 30 August 2019</p>",

Dominic Lawson called him \u201cthe Greta Garbo of business\u201d. Both Hans and Gad eschewed gossip columns and parties. Business journalists struggled, too, to penetrate the Rausings\u2019 empire. Because it was a private company controlled through a Liechtenstein foundation and a Dutch holding group, the firm could avoid publishing annual reports or accounts. In 1991, though, Tetra Pak bought the Swedish agricultural, engineering and food processing group Alfa Laval for \u00a31.5bn. Though fabulously wealthy, with homes in Sweden, London and Barbados, Hans deprecated the high life: \u201cEither you have 20 mistresses covered with diamonds and a Mercedes 500, or you achieve something with your money. For me it is a passion to try to develop and create industry in different ways.\u201d In 1995 Hans sold his share of Tetra Laval to Gad for an estimated $7bn. In 2001, though, he was back in business launching a successor packaging venture, EcoLean, with a container made of about 60% chalk and 40% natural gas. What looked like sibling rivalry to create another multibillion pound packaging business, was rather, Hans claimed, \u201cecologically perfect\u201d. \u201cNobody else has, so far as I know, imitated an eggshell before, but this is basically an eggshell, only not brittle,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen the product is disposed of, it becomes brittle in sunlight and after a month or so it just disintegrates into sand.\u201d Today EcoLean, based in Sk\u00e5ne, has operations in 30 countries. In 2006 Rausing received an honorary knighthood in recognition of his philanthropic services. These included a donation of \u00a32.5m to Cambridge University for a maths centre in 1997. His Hans Rausing Endangered Languages Project at the University of London supports research, training and archiving of disappearing languages. In 2004, among other donations to the Conservative party, he gave \u00a3198,000 as Michael Howard sought funds to fight the 2005 election. His children, who described Rausing as \u201ca loving father and devoted family man\u201d, followed their father in philanthropy. The total value of his family\u2019s donations since 1998 has exceeded \u00a31bn, funding medical research, as well as cultural and environmental projects. Sigrid has written of inheriting great wealth that: \u201cThe pros \u2026 I believe, are largely illusory and can become pathological. An illusory sense of being special and different, the assumption that one is interesting to other people only, or mainly, because of the money and subsequent feelings of isolation.\u201d In 2017 she published a memoir, Mayhem, focused on the story of her brother, who became a drug addict in his 20s, and his wife Eva, whom he met in an American rehab clinic, and who was found dead at their home in London in July 2012. She had died two months earlier from what the coroner called the effects of cocaine on a damaged heart. Hans is survived by M\u00e4rit, their children and seven grandchildren. \u2022 Hans Rausing, entrepreneur and philanthropist, born 25 March 1926; died 30 August 2019",

      "bodyText": "A statue of a second world war Red Army general repeatedly targeted by vandals has been covered with a tarpaulin amid an escalating row between Czech officials and Russia\u2019s embassy in Prague over its status. Authorities in the Czech capital\u2019s Bubene\u010d district put the imposing monument honouring Marshal Ivan Konev under cover after saying they were no longer prepared to keep cleaning it following repeated paint and graffiti attacks. The move \u2013 announced by the mayor of Prague 6 municipality, Ond\u0159ej Kol\u00e1\u0159 \u2013 has further inflamed passions over the 40-year-old statue, long controversial in the Czech Republic because of Konev\u2019s role as an enforcer of Soviet military power in postwar eastern Europe. Kol\u00e1\u0159, a member of the pro-EU Top 09 party, said he had been forced to leave Prague after being given police protection, which was put in place on Friday after he received threats by email, social media and text message. \u201cPeople were calling my office, threatening even my assistants,\u201d he said. \u201cA few have also come personally to the town hall, asking the receptionists where I could be found so they can beat me up.\u201d The Russian embassy denounced his decision on its Facebook page as a \u201crepeated disgrace\u201d and noted that it was \u201ctaken on the eve of the 80th anniversary of the start of the worst military conflict in human history\u201d.

Czech media attributed the damage to \u201cactivists\u201d, widely believed to be pro-Russian. Temporary fencing has been installed to foil further attempts to rip off the cover. A council spokesman said it would remain at least until 12 September, when the statue\u2019s future will be discussed at a council meeting. At the weekend, a worker re-covered the monument, located on Interbrig\u00e1dy Square \u2013 a neighbourhood that also hosts the Czech defence ministry and army headquarters \u2013 while opposing groups of activists gathered under the watch of two police officers. Petr L\u00e1z\u0148ovsk\u00fd, 48, a pro-democracy campaigner waving a large Nato flag, called the controversy an example of the \u201chybrid warfare\u201d he said Russia was waging on the Czech Republic. \u201cThe crucial point for me is that the Russian embassy, in its Facebook post, claimed it had received letters from Czech citizens wondering which side in the second world war would the Prague 6 mayor have preferred to have won,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are implying that Mayor Kol\u00e1\u0159 is pro-Nazi.

The \u201cBasic Law\u201d constitution guarantees to protect, for the next 50 years, the democratic institutions that make&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong&nbsp;distinct from Communist-ruled mainland China.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2003:&nbsp;</b>Hong&nbsp;Kong\u2019s leaders introduce legislation that would forbid acts of treason and subversion against the Chinese government. The bill resembles laws used to charge dissidents on the mainland. An estimated half a million people turn out to protest against the bill. As a result of the backlash, further action on the proposal is halted.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2007:&nbsp;</b>The Basic Law stated that the ultimate aim was for&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong\u2019s voters to achieve a complete democracy, but China decides in 2007 that universal suffrage in elections for the chief executive cannot be implemented until 2017. Some lawmakers are chosen by business and trade groups, while others are elected by vote. In a bid to accelerate a decision on universal suffrage, five lawmakers resign. But this act is followed by the adoption of the Beijing-backed electoral changes, which expand the chief executive\u2019s selection committee and add more seats for lawmakers elected by direct vote. The legislation divides Hong&nbsp;Kong's pro-democracy camp, as some support the reforms while others say they will only delay full democracy while reinforcing a structure that favors Beijing.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2014:&nbsp;</b>The Chinese government introduces a bill allowing Hong&nbsp;Kong&nbsp;residents to vote for their leader in 2017, but with one major caveat: the candidates must be approved by Beijing. Pro-democracy lawmakers are incensed by the bill, which they call an example of \u201cfake universal suffrage\u201d and \u201cfake democracy\u201d. The move triggers a massive protest as crowds occupy some of&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong\u2019s most crowded districts for 70 days. In June 2015,&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong&nbsp;legislators formally reject the bill, and electoral reform stalls. The current chief executive, Carrie Lam, widely seen as the Chinese Communist party\u2019s favoured candidate, is hand-picked in 2017 by a 1,200-person committee dominated by pro-Beijing elites.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2019:&nbsp;</b>Lam pushes amendments to extradition laws that would allow people to be sent to mainland China to face charges. The proposed legislation triggers a huge protest, with organisers putting the turnout at 1 million, and a standoff that forces the legislature to postpone debate on the bills. After weeks of protest, often meeting with violent reprisals from the Hong Kong police, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/04/hong-kong-lam-to-withdraw-extradition-bill-say-reports\">Lam announced that she would withdraw the bill</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Opponents say using legislation designed to suspend basic rights is inherently drastic and would end Hong Kong\u2019s status as Asia\u2019s premier financial centre.

Senior officials have spoken not only of \u201cterrorist acts\u201d but of \u201ccolour revolution characteristics\u201d, making it clear that they have ruled out compromise.

      "body": "<p>As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/sajid-javid\">Sajid Javid</a> prepares to deliver his spending round statement this week, Britain is yet again on the brink of another week of Brexit chaos. But in his debut Commons set piece, the chancellor will be looking to make another point to distract from the turmoil to mark a potentially pivotal turning point: the end of austerity.</p> <p>Thanks to the hard work of people in Britain, he will undoubtedly say, the decade of fiscal restraint has now run its course. This is a big moment for the country: public services will get the money they badly need, and Britain will live within its means.</p> <p>There have been turning points in the public finances throughout history, when the spending taps are turned off and services are squeezed, before an eventual backlash as services come under strain, forcing the taps back on again.</p> <p>From the Geddes Axe cuts of the Conservative\u2013Liberal coalition of the 1920s to fix the public finances after the first world war, and a similar act by the wartime coalition of the 1940s, there have been more than a dozen periods of belt-tightening in the past century.</p> <p>Since the spending squeeze imposed by the Conservative\u2013Lib Dem coalition in the early 2010s, Britain has been subjected to one of the longest periods of restraint on record. More than half of current MPs have no parliamentary experience from before the banking crash, entering parliament since 2010 and knowing only the austerity age, as have millions of young voters who have turned 18 since.</p> <p>But for the first time since the imposition of austerity in 2010, Javid\u2019s spending round is expected to mark the return of real-terms gains for overall departmental spending. That has not happened since 2007 \u2013 back when the chancellor was still <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/05/john-mcdonnell-questions-chancellors-suitability-for-office\">selling risky bonds</a> in the boom years of his investment banking career.</p> <p>But there is one big problem with declaring this return to normal: the political and economic situation is anything but. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/aug/09/with-britain-on-the-cusp-of-recession-doomsters-may-be-proven-right\">Britain is on the cusp of recession</a> and a no-deal Brexit is likely to make matters worse.</p> <p>For that reason the spending review is only covering a 12-month period. The big decisions will need to come afterwards, given the huge scale of the uncertainty for the public finances should Britain crash out without a deal.</p> <p>The turning point this week is therefore more about the formalisation of a series of ad-hoc policy announcements gearing the country up for a showdown, rather than the proper end of austerity required.</p> <p>There are two issues it will confront. Javid says the spending round is about clearing the decks to allow greater focus on Brexit, but it will do anything but. Attempting to schedule time in the Commons this week is about running down the clock, robbing MPs of time to debate the impact of Boris Johnson extracting Britain from the EU do or die.</p> <p>It is also about paving the way for a possible general election. Leading voters to the polling stations is invariably accompanied by tax cuts or spending increases. Johnson will hope that splashing the cash sends a message: trust me. I can carry off Brexit and raise your living standards all at the same time.</p> <p>The Tories have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/29/boris-johnson-says-hell-spend-but-who-will-pay\">shaken the magic money tree with abandon</a>, producing crowd-pleasing dollops of cash for public services since Johnson\u2019s elevation to No 10 in July.</p> <p>Taken together, the government\u2019s announcements so far total about \u00a36bn of extra spending and borrowing in 2020-21, with the largest chunk going towards reversing cuts to per-pupil funding in schools. The government will also reveal the cost of hiring 20,000 more police officers, and about \u00a31.8bn has been announced for hospitals.</p> <p>But it is a high-risk strategy when a no-deal Brexit could sink the country into recession and damage the public finances, making it tough to bring about the end of austerity.</p> <p>The chancellor said last week that there would be no \u201cblank cheque\u201d for departments and that he would stay within the fiscal rules set by his predecessor, Philip Hammond.</p> <p>Javid is bound by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/31/sajid-javid-johnson-fiscal-plans-unveiled-spendiong-review\">rules to keep public debt falling</a> as a percentage of GDP and to ensure borrowing, adjusted for the state of the economy, is below 2% of GDP in 2020-21. The self-imposed rules also call for the government to bring the public finances into balance by the mid-2020s \u2013 a promise economists say will be almost impossible to keep.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/09/archive-zip/giv-39021i0TXGDAw0Gh/\" data-alt=\"Spending cuts graph\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/09/archive-zip/giv-39021i0TXGDAw0Gh/\">Spending cuts graph</a> </figure>  <p>The chancellor probably has headroom of about \u00a314bn to stay within the rules next year on the forecasts for the economy he is using, based on the assessment made by the Office for Budget Responsibility in March.</p> <p>But the promises shouldn\u2019t be worth much, as the economy has changed significantly since then.

      "bodyText": "As Sajid Javid prepares to deliver his spending round statement this week, Britain is yet again on the brink of another week of Brexit chaos. But in his debut Commons set piece, the chancellor will be looking to make another point to distract from the turmoil to mark a potentially pivotal turning point: the end of austerity. Thanks to the hard work of people in Britain, he will undoubtedly say, the decade of fiscal restraint has now run its course. This is a big moment for the country: public services will get the money they badly need, and Britain will live within its means. There have been turning points in the public finances throughout history, when the spending taps are turned off and services are squeezed, before an eventual backlash as services come under strain, forcing the taps back on again. From the Geddes Axe cuts of the Conservative\u2013Liberal coalition of the 1920s to fix the public finances after the first world war, and a similar act by the wartime coalition of the 1940s, there have been more than a dozen periods of belt-tightening in the past century. Since the spending squeeze imposed by the Conservative\u2013Lib Dem coalition in the early 2010s, Britain has been subjected to one of the longest periods of restraint on record. More than half of current MPs have no parliamentary experience from before the banking crash, entering parliament since 2010 and knowing only the austerity age, as have millions of young voters who have turned 18 since. But for the first time since the imposition of austerity in 2010, Javid\u2019s spending round is expected to mark the return of real-terms gains for overall departmental spending. That has not happened since 2007 \u2013 back when the chancellor was still selling risky bonds in the boom years of his investment banking career. But there is one big problem with declaring this return to normal: the political and economic situation is anything but. Britain is on the cusp of recession and a no-deal Brexit is likely to make matters worse. For that reason the spending review is only covering a 12-month period. The big decisions will need to come afterwards, given the huge scale of the uncertainty for the public finances should Britain crash out without a deal. The turning point this week is therefore more about the formalisation of a series of ad-hoc policy announcements gearing the country up for a showdown, rather than the proper end of austerity required. There are two issues it will confront. Javid says the spending round is about clearing the decks to allow greater focus on Brexit, but it will do anything but. Attempting to schedule time in the Commons this week is about running down the clock, robbing MPs of time to debate the impact of Boris Johnson extracting Britain from the EU do or die. It is also about paving the way for a possible general election. Leading voters to the polling stations is invariably accompanied by tax cuts or spending increases. Johnson will hope that splashing the cash sends a message: trust me. I can carry off Brexit and raise your living standards all at the same time. The Tories have shaken the magic money tree with abandon, producing crowd-pleasing dollops of cash for public services since Johnson\u2019s elevation to No 10 in July. Taken together, the government\u2019s announcements so far total about \u00a36bn of extra spending and borrowing in 2020-21, with the largest chunk going towards reversing cuts to per-pupil funding in schools. The government will also reveal the cost of hiring 20,000 more police officers, and about \u00a31.8bn has been announced for hospitals. But it is a high-risk strategy when a no-deal Brexit could sink the country into recession and damage the public finances, making it tough to bring about the end of austerity. The chancellor said last week that there would be no \u201cblank cheque\u201d for departments and that he would stay within the fiscal rules set by his predecessor, Philip Hammond. Javid is bound by the rules to keep public debt falling as a percentage of GDP and to ensure borrowing, adjusted for the state of the economy, is below 2% of GDP in 2020-21. The self-imposed rules also call for the government to bring the public finances into balance by the mid-2020s \u2013 a promise economists say will be almost impossible to keep. The chancellor probably has headroom of about \u00a314bn to stay within the rules next year on the forecasts for the economy he is using, based on the assessment made by the Office for Budget Responsibility in March. But the promises shouldn\u2019t be worth much, as the economy has changed significantly since then. Javid is escaping proper scrutiny by using these forecasts to talk about ending austerity while keeping the country\u2019s finances on an even keel. The Resolution Foundation estimates that a true reflection of the finances to account for Britain skirting recession in recent months cuts his headroom by \u00a310bn. According to Yael Selfin, the chief economist of KPMG, a no-deal Brexit could damage the public purse to the tune of about \u00a340bn. \u201cIt would not make sense to rush any additional spending at this stage,\u201d she said. \u201cIt makes sense to be prudent and say: \u2018I\u2019m going to hold back to leave a bit of margin for Brexit.\u2019\u201d Either way, the public finances will look very different by the end of the year, making this week\u2019s spending review a short-term project: the promise to remain in keeping with the fiscal rules will be broken in months, if not weeks. All of this brings back ironic memories of the long-term economic plan, the ubiquitous soundbite of David Cameron and George Osborne. It had been the key plank of the 2015 election campaign, helping the Conservatives to win an unexpected majority against Ed Miliband. That too was electioneering rhetoric, but at least considered management of the economy over a longer period of time than Javid is working towards. Britain badly needs a long-term economic plan. But there is no such strategy as Javid and Johnson look to get through the next few weeks. The UK has significant scope to raise spending on public services, given historically low borrowing costs on the international market. The deficit has been cut down to a 17-year low. Rather than a panic-driven spending round, real issues must be tackled over the long term, such as reducing child poverty, improving social care, fixing the country\u2019s productivity puzzle and reversing cuts to local council services. A turning point might have arrived. But Javid could be leading us dangerously in the wrong direction.",

      "bodyText": "And here\u2019s Ewan Murray\u2019s match report: Neil Lennon \u201cI was an outstanding performance again. Everyone\u2019s written us off recently. We\u2019ve had a few weeks where we\u2019ve been written off but we don\u2019t believe the noise, don\u2019t believe the hype. Today was an outstanding masterclass of how to play in a derby. We dominated the first half, we weren\u2019t in any trouble. Maybe now people will cut us a bit of slack and respect us. My captain set the tone, as you have to do \u2013 we were physical, Rangers were physical, but we came out on top. We came here as underdogs for whatever reason but I think we put out a message today.\u201d Christopher Jullien: \u201cMy first Old Firm derby \u2013 woah! But it was a victory, so it was perfect. I have no words for the job we did on the field. Johnny [Hayes] finished it off but for 95 minutes we really pushed, everyone was like a family on the field. We defended well, we talk a lot.\u201d Johnny Hayes: \u201cThe manager has been drumming it into us that we need to start better. We worked long and hard on the training field this week and this afternoon we reaped the rewards on our hard work.\u201d And that\u2019s the last act of the game. The final whistle is the cue for Steven Gerrard to march miserably towards the changing rooms while the Celtic players and staff amass in the corner to drink in the exaltations of their handful of travelling fans. They deserve their win. And there it is. Jordan Jones is given his marching orders for a hilariously shameless lunge on Moritz Bauer. Shin-height, the ball long gone, it\u2019s as clear a red card as you\u2019ll ever see. 95 mins Morelos latches on to Bolingoli\u2019s mistimed header but can\u2019t direct his first-time lob on target. That was a decent chance. A lightning one-touch counter from Celtic sees Edouard give it to Ntcham and Ntcham to Hayes, who races clear of a lethargic Rangers defence. His initial shot is superbly saved by McGregor but he gets to the rebound first and slots into an empty net. And that\u2019s that. 92 mins Hope dwindles for Rangers as another set-piece comes to nowt when Goldon\u2019s header bounces harmlessly wide. Four minutes of stoppage time to play. 89 mins And we have the game\u2019s first yellow card. It goes to Arfield, for grabbing a fistful of Ntcham\u2019s shorts as Celtic threatened a counter. Then Hayes gets one for some silly scrapping with Morelos. London buses. 87 mins Another Rangers set-piece comes to nothing, Tavernier\u2019s free-kick from the right headed away by the imperious Jullien. Celtic venture forward and Hayes\u2019 driven low cross from the left is cut out on the slide by a desperate Goldson from pretty much beneath his own crossbar. Good defending. 85 mins Celtic change: Johnston off, Hayes on. 84 mins A rare Celtic attack sees Ntcham bounce a delicious one-two off Edouard to open up a good sight of goal. His shot is firm, side-footed\u2026 and straight at a grateful McGregor. He should have done better. All Celtic\u2019s best moves tend to involve Edouard. 82 mins It\u2019s corner after corner for Rangers, but none of them fruitful. Celtic have given up trying to counterattack and are instead camped entirely in their own half, defending assuredly and in numbers. 80 mins A foraging run from Jones forces a corner. It\u2019s half-cleared as far as an onrushing Tavernier, whose half-volley whistles just over. Rangers are getting warmer. 78 mins We\u2019re up the other end, and Jack\u2019s sweet volley is blocked before Arfield drifts a header tamely wide having met a right-wing cross. And breathe. 76 mins It\u2019s headed away by Jullien. Celtic break quickly and Ntcham\u2019s effort is deflected over, before the same thing happens again from the resulting corner. Celtic get another corner and McGregor is forced into two fine saves in quick succession, both to keep out close-range efforts with his feet. 75 mins Rangers are pushing hard for the equaliser without creating anything clearcut. Jones draws a foul on the left - Tavernier will take the free kick. 72 mins Brown steams into a tackle, wins the ball and sends it early to Edouard. It opens up for him as he cuts in from the left but he can\u2019t take advantage, firing meekly over. 70 mins That\u2019s Aribo\u2019s last contribution. He makes way for Jordan Jones. 67 mins A sight of goal for Aribo, who picks up a square ball from Arfield and takes aim, but the shot is dragged harmlessly wide. 62 mins Christie dances dangerously into the box before running into traffic at the vital moment. As Rangers break with Ojo, McGregor\u2019s shameless attempted foul is his second booking-worthy challenge of the afternoon, and the second one ignored in favour of an advantage. But the attack comes to nothing. Celtic make a double change: Bauer for Bitton, Ntcham for Forrest 60 mins And he\u2019s involved immediately, leaving Bolingoli for dead on the right flank before seeing his name in lights and blazing a wildly ambitious shot comedically wide. Promising though. 59 mins Davis wafts a pass out of play, and Rangers make their second change. Morelos for Defoe. He\u2019ll bring some much-needed calm to proceedings. 55 mins Ojo involved again down the left, rifling left-footed at goal, Forster beating it away. Ojo\u2019s pace and trickery could be the way back into this for Rangers: he\u2019s given them an injection of excitement. If only there was an obvious pun to be made. 53 mins Davis slides in Defoe, who jinks hopefully into the box but can\u2019t get past Jullien. The decibel level rises another notch as Alfredo Morelos embarks on a vigorous warm-up. 49 mins Jack slides in to win the ball in midfield and starts another Rangers attack. It ends with Defoe, whose snapshot is deflected wide and the resulting corner punched clear by Forster. Celtic threaten to break, but Arfield snuffs it out with Makelele-like efficiency. Much more purposeful from the hosts so far this half. 46 mins We\u2019re away again, with Ojo making an early impression with a darting run up the left. Rangers win a throw, keep the ball for a bit, and work it forward again. They already look more composed. And there it is - Sheyi Ojo is coming on for Glen Kamara. Unsurprising from Gerrard, and positive. The second half is imminent. Rangers muster a rare attack but Tavernier\u2019s cross sails out for a goal kick. The referee blows up, and that\u2019s it for a half pleasingly high on violence but notably short on class. Good fun though. Celtic were comfortably the better team one the early mania died down, with Rangers badly lacking a spark: surely not long until Gerrard sends for Morelos and/or Ojo. 44 mins A little cameo from the referee, who plays an unintentional one-two in the centre circle with Flanagan. It\u2019s frenetic stuff here, with the aggression:quality ratio meaning very little constructive possession. 40 mins The challenges are flying in. An ariel challenge between Defoe and Elhamed leaves the latter on the floor. Some more snapping in midfield. Flanagan takes out Forrest. Astonishingly, the Bobby Madden hasn\u2019t brought out his cards yet. 36 mins A bone-shaking moment as Jack and Bolingoli clatter violently into each other, the Rangers man arriving late, studs glistening, and leaving his opponent in a screaming heap. The ball was there (I think). Goldson gives the ball away in dangerous territory in the right-back position. Johnston pounces, drives forward and slips in Edouard, who has peeled off to beat the offside trap with impeccable timing. He slots cooly past McGregor. 30 mins In classic style, Defoe wriggles into a half-yard of space inside the box and rifles at goal. Forster saves, but it was offside. 28 mins \u2026and wafts his shot a good mile or two wide. 28 mins Edouard and Christie link up again - keep your eye out for that combination - and the latter is brought down 25 yards from goal. Edouard stands over the ball\u2026 25 mins Rangers win two crunching 50-50s to start a promising attack, which fizzles out when Defoe\u2019s ball out wide goes to no one. Aribo then works his way into the box down the left but is halted with extreme prejudice by Brown. 22 mins Some lovely link-up play between Christie and Edouard ends with the latter clatteringly dispossessed on the edge of the box just as he was about to pull the trigger. Celtic suddenly look a class above. 20 mins Celtic finally show a bit of composure in possession, keeping the ball, working it around the pitch patiently and quieting the crowd (although these things are relative). That\u2019ll please Lennon. 17 mins Nutmeg claxon! Kamara on Brown, the Ibrox crowd deafeningly delighted. It\u2019s followed with comic inevitability by Brown hounding down Kamara for a retributive hack. Veins bulge. No card. 13 mins Neither side have looked assured enough to put their stamp on the game yet, both so far happy to forfeit imagination in favour of the avoidance of early mistakes. Elhamed and Flanagan clash heads, and both hoist themselves off the turf. 11 mins It\u2019s fierce stuff here, with both sides hunting the ball like wolves as soon as possession reaches the middle third. Scott Brown registers his first challenge of the match. 8 mins McGregor scythes down Davis in the centre circle but a good advantage sees Rangers work their way into the box with some nice one-touch stuff, but no one can quite get a shot away. Absurdly, McGregor escapes a booking. 7 mins A flash of adventure from Johnston, who wriggles into the Rangers box down the left and forces a corner. Christie\u2019s delivery is headed away. 6 mins Still waiting for the first spell of sustained possession from either side as Christie\u2019s mis-hit crossfield ball sails away from Bolingoli to a chorus of sadistic Ibrox cheers. 1 min The first crunching challenge comes courtesy of Jon Flanagan, and the first attempt on goal from Christie, whose long-ranger whistles over. No surprises on either count. A lively start. And it\u2019s a bizarre kickoff, Edouard punting it long and diagonal, rugby-style, for a Rangers throw-in in their own corner - not even attempting to find a team-mate. File under \u2018maverick\u2019. The teams are out, and all jaws are clenched firmly into game-face mode. Handshakes are exchanged in the Neville-Vieira stylee. So where might today\u2019s game be won and lost? Certainly Rangers will need to keep close tabs on the livewire Odsonne Edouard, one of three scorers against Cluj on Thursday, especially when he peels off into the space behind the full-backs. And pulses will quicken if and when Ryan Christie, not averse to the odd wondergoal, finds a pocket of space in front of the Rangers back four. At the other end, grizzled veteran Jermain Defoe comes into the game off the back of a hat-trick against Hibs last weekend, and the fact that Alfredo Morelos and Sheyi Ojo have six goals between them in the last two games yet both start on the bench gives some idea of the increasing depth of Rangers\u2019 options. And then of course there\u2019s the midfield battleground: not much tactical analysis to be applied there other than to say that teeth will be bared, tackles will fly and bones will shudder. Some pre-match reading courtesy of our man in Scotland: Rangers: McGregor, Tavernier, Goldson, Katic, Flanagan, Jack, Davis, Kamara, Aribo, Arfield, Defoe. Subs: Foderingham, Helander, Barisic, King, Ojo, Morelos, Jones Celtic: Forster, Jullien, Bitton, Brown, Christie, Johnston, Edouard, Bolingoli-Mbombo, Elhamed, McGregor, Forrest. Subs: Gordon, Griffiths, Bayo, Bauer, Hayes, Morgan, Ntcham Sixteen. The atomic number of sulphur. The voting age in Nicaragua. The number of petals on the Imperial Seal of Japan.

      "bodyText": "An environmental group has been forced to withdraw its legal challenge to a wide-ranging injunction by the fracking firm Cuadrilla after being \u201cpriced out of court\u201d. Three fracking protesters are facing court action after the energy company obtained the injunction restricting protests at its shale gas exploration site in Lancashire. The protesters, Katrina Lawrie, 41, Christopher Wilson, 55, and Lee Walsh, 44, were due to be supported by Friends of the Earth (FoE) in their bid to vary the terms of the injunction order. However, the environmental group said it has been frozen out of court proceedings after a high court judge refused to grant any costs protection. FoE had applied for financial protection on the basis that it was a public interest litigant. In environmental judicial reviews, a cap on legal costs is available and cost protection may also be obtained in non-environmental judicial reviews. However, a high court judge ruled that cost protection was unavailable on the basis that the case was private litigation between private parties. This meant if FoE lost the case it could face an \u00a385,000 legal bill. The group said this was a financial risk it could not afford. The FoE campaigner Dave Timms said: \u201cThis ruling is a blow for civil liberties and access to justice. \u201cThe public\u2019s right to peacefully protest has been severely and unlawfully restricted by Cuadrilla\u2019s injunction \u2013 we should be allowed to challenge it without facing huge financial penalties. \u201cWe are effectively being priced out of justice. The cost ruling means that the rights of the wider public, who might be caught by disproportionate injunctions against persons unknown, cannot be represented in court by public interest organisations without taking on huge financial risk.\u201d In June this year Lawrie, Wilson and Walsh were found in contempt of court for taking part in a protest outside Cuadrilla\u2019s Preston New Road site near Blackpool. The trio had locked their arms inside tubes in a protest in the site entrance on 24 July last year. The action prevented lorries getting in or out of the site for about six-and-a-half hours. Judge Pelling had granted the injunction to Cuadrilla in June 2018. It outlawed specific types of protest, as well as obstruction at the site, trespass and conspiracy to delay or cause inconvenience against Cuadrilla or its contractors. Before the sentencing is carried out at the high court in Manchester on Monday, the protesters are applying to vary the injunction which, if successful, may impact on their sentence. They will argue that sections of the injunction are unlawful following an earlier judgment by the court of appeal, in which a very similar injunction granted to Ineos was substantially reduced. Last month, a large tremor caused houses to shake near Preston New Road, the UK\u2019s only active fracking site. The 2.9-magnitude quake is believed to be the biggest fracking-related tremor seen in Britain. Stephanie Harrison QC, who was due to represent FoE, warned the ruling set a dangerous precedent and called for an urgent review. She said: \u201cPrivate companies deploying their superior resources and financial might to utilise court proceedings to prevent and deter peaceful protest through pursuing draconian injunctions is a serious threat to our civil liberties. \u201cAn urgent review of the use of civil proceedings to regulate free speech and peaceful protest and the implications of these proceedings for access to justice and equality before the law is urgently required.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>My singing voice is a part of my body that I have for years disowned. I was a child when I let it go. Of this moment I remember only the bright orange carpet of our lounge, the spiral rug. When someone remarked on my \u201cracket\u201d, I guess my head dropped and floor is all I saw. But as I was eight or nine, and I\u2019m now 47, I can\u2019t be sure. I know only this: in that moment, I shut my mouth to singing. For decades, scarcely a song seeped out.</p> <p>All my life, I have tried to square the longing to sing with the fear of being heard. There have been times \u2013 as a teenager in love with a guitarist, for instance, and at my nan\u2019s funeral \u2013 when I have yearned to join my voice with others\u2019 voices. At birthday celebrations, I latch on to the handful of low notes familiar from speech, like finding a cluster of friends at a party of strangers, and skip every other word. My version goes: \u201cHappy birthday \u2026 Happy birthday \u2026 Happy \u2026 Susan \u2026 you!\u201d Karaoke was invented the year before I was born, but I have never tried it.</p> <p>Instead, I developed a sort of soundless singing, in which the one safe place to do it was in my head. I am only now learning that I had in effect joined a vast, global choir of silent singers, all scarred by some childhood slight and unable to find a home in any song.</p> <p>Mindful of my impediment, I have tried to encourage my children to sing, so I have sung to them \u2013 the exception to my silence \u2013 not as if no one is listening, but as if no one had told me I couldn\u2019t. \u201cMummy has a beautiful voice,\u201d they say. And although this sounds kind rather than truthful, I have decided, after more than three decades of silence, to find and own up to my singing voice \u2013 this part of me that is neither muscle nor bone, that I cannot put a finger on but which engages three-quarters of my torso (according to Anne Karpf, in her book <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/jul/01/featuresreviews.guardianreview5\" title=\"\">The Human Voice</a>).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"907f73d52203b0bc5d237e3f47ad3676273351dd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/907f73d52203b0bc5d237e3f47ad3676273351dd/0_104_5000_3186/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018There you have it!\u2019 Singing coach Eleanor Wood.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"637\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018There you have it!\u2019 Singing coach Eleanor Wood.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What are my voice\u2019s qualities? Why do I feel fine speaking in daily life, but phobic about anyone outside my children\u2019s bedrooms hearing me string together two melodic notes? The voice in my head, which I know all too well, is quiet and deep. But if the average vocal range of an adult is two octaves, what might my voice do if given freedom to roam?</p> <p>To find out, I have arranged to meet <a href=\"https://www.city-academy.com/tutor/eleanor-wood\" title=\"\">Eleanor Wood</a>, a singing coach at London\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.city-academy.com/\" title=\"\">City Academy</a>. I know that the only way to end my silence is to conjure an expectant audience and constrain myself to keep the appointment. The <a href=\"https://www.thejoint.org.uk/\" title=\"\">studio</a> is five minutes from my office, but it is not an easy walk. I sing random notes aloud as I go, but my metaphorical ear is so attuned to my metaphorical voice I have no idea if I am audible to anyone but me.</p> <p>In the tiny piano room the fan is humming, the chairs are creaking. What noise will I make? \u201cWhat if I\u2019m out of tune?\u201d I ask Wood. \u201cDo people ever open their mouths and nothing comes out?\u201d It\u2019s like being at the doctor\u2019s and asking a multitude of questions to delay the inevitable examination. \u201cI\u2019d like a diagnosis of my voice,\u201d I quaver.</p> <p>\u201cWe can totally do that,\u201d says Wood, a classically trained soprano. \u201cFirst we\u2019re just going to use our voices. Wake them up a bit.\u201d She straightens my posture and together we hum a \u201csiren\u201d, from the bottom of our voices to the top. Wood\u2019s voice is clear and strong, whereas mine likes to curl up in small spaces. It easily hides inside hers. But then Wood strikes a key and asks me to find the note alone. \u201cNear!\u201d she says. \u201cPretty near!\u201d</p> <p>We do this exercise trilling \u201clip bubbles\u201d, rolling Rs, and mini-scales, like taking our voices up and down a very short ladder. I try not to flinch at my racket while Wood says \u201cAmazing!\u201d and \u201cAwesome!\u201d and \u201cThere you have it!\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"03e74acec78ac1b1ab8fa3fe415527617701a0c6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/03e74acec78ac1b1ab8fa3fe415527617701a0c6/0_36_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paula tries some singing exercises with Eleanor Wood.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paula tries some singing exercises with Eleanor Wood.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I have chosen to sing Manic Monday by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2003/mar/14/artsfeatures.shopping\" title=\"\">the Bangles</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/bobdylan\" title=\"\">Bob Dylan\u2019s</a> Don\u2019t Think Twice, It\u2019s All Right: I\u2019d like to replay a sliver of my teen years with the volume up. Maybe because Wood and I have spent so long making silly noises, I don\u2019t balk when she explains that I have only one voice, and the one that I use to read bedtime stories or answer a phone is the same one that, in a few minutes, I will use to sing.</p> <p>Thankfully, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsmVgoXDq2w\" title=\"\">Manic Monday</a> has a range mostly limited to four notes, and is heavy on \u201cspeech quality\u201d, as defined by the legendary speech pathologist <a href=\"https://www.estillvoice.com/\">Jo Estill</a> \u2013 a style of singing that is close to talking. While Wood plays piano or clicks her fingers, I chant the words, then articulate them more melodically. I hear myself grow louder.</p> <p>There is no line between speech and song \u2013 all speaking voices contain fragments of higher pitches, harmonics \u2013 so if there is a moment when I start to sing, I don\u2019t notice it. I\u2019m just drawing out the pitches from my speech and sustaining them. Besides, I\u2019m distracted by the lyrics. Did people really go to work worrying about whether their beds were made?</p> <p>Afterwards, Wood swivels on her piano stool. \u201cIn terms of a diagnosis, you sound very comfortable singing low notes. The upper range needs exploring. It\u2019s not just about your range, though, but colour and quality, which I would say is very warm. It\u2019s tentative,\u201d Wood says, \u201cbut you\u2019ve got all the bones of a voice.\u201d</p> <p>I feel elated, as if my singing skeleton is coming to life. So it\u2019s a shock to get home and listen to my recording of the lesson. Only Wood\u2019s voice is audible! Mine, which had resonated with appalling volume in my head, is nowhere to be found. I\u2019m a ghost on the tape.</p> <p>Where is my voice? Why does it sound so loud to me but not to anyone else? \u201cI guess we all hear ourselves a little differently,\u201d Wood says diplomatically.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e8b77f8fe6bbed70d5cb4281cb9f7b64e383837a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e8b77f8fe6bbed70d5cb4281cb9f7b64e383837a/0_333_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eternal Flame music sheet\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paula gets to grips with the Bangles\u2019 Eternal Flame.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>According to <a href=\"http://www.christellaantoni.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Christella Antoni</a>, a speech and voice therapist, \u201cWe tend to hear our voice higher than it is, because it is conducted through the skull bones.\u201d But Johan Sundberg, author of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/science-of-the-singing-voice.html\" title=\"\">The Science of the Singing Voice</a>, says: \u201cOne\u2019s own voice doesn\u2019t sound to others as it sounds to you for the simple reason that your ears are not in front of your mouth.\u201d He says my voice \u201cis clear, with no leakage\u201d.</p> <p>A voice traverses its owner\u2019s body, amplifying our inner dimension for the outside world. \u201cYou were musical before you were anything else,\u201d says <a href=\"https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=GFWEL02\" title=\"\">Graham Welch</a>, chair of music education at University College London, and author of The Oxford Handbook of Singing. \u201cWhat you\u2019re hearing inside the womb is the melody, the rhythm, the tonal colours.\u201d Apparently, consonants can\u2019t travel through amniotic fluid.</p> <p>\u201cThe voice is one of the first sensorial aspects of contact with the mother,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.rosineperelberg.com/\" title=\"\">Rosine Perelberg</a>, president of the Institute of Psychoanalysis. She mentions <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/28/julia-kristeva-communist-secret-agent-bulgaria-claims\" title=\"\">Julia Kristeva\u2019s</a> concept of the semiotic, \u201ca sensorial domain which includes sounds and voice of the mother\u201d, and which gets repressed by the realm of rules and laws, Perelberg says. \u201cBut it\u2019s never totally repressed. It survives in different ways. You recovered it when you became a mother, first in private relationships with your own children, and now in public.\u201d</p> <p>Welch has encountered many people who \u201ccarry the psychological burden\u201d of having had their singing criticised in childhood \u2013 what Perelberg describes as \u201ca prohibition\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve got PhDs on this,\u201d Welch says, waving to shelves laden with heavy volumes containing the stories of other members of the silent choir. \u201cI talk to people in their 80s, and they can tell me about that moment as if it were yesterday.\u201d It\u2019s such a pity because by the age of 11 only 2-3% of children sing out of tune, he says.</p> <p>In my next lesson with City Academy\u2019s Wood, I practise the Bangles\u2019 Eternal Flame. At the end of the hour, I can hit six notes, from middle C to A. The higher notes seem to ring in my head, the lower ones in my chest. I\u2019m learning that I will not find my voice in any one place. But when I sing \u2018\u201cflaaaame\u201d, on that A above middle C, a sound comes out of my mouth that I never knew I could make. It is powerful and secure and true. I don\u2019t always find it, but at least I know it\u2019s there.</p> <p>By the fourth lesson, Eternal Flame is taking shape. I sing all the way back to my desk. I sing (very quietly) in the queue for a sandwich. I sing on my bike and I don\u2019t stop when I see a pedestrian. At yoga, I om with everyone else. I\u2019m like one of those people who are pleased with their work in the gym and want to go everywhere in a muscle tee.</p> <p>At home the children are singing Eternal Flame. The whole house hums with it. I listen to the recording of my latest lesson and my voice is on the tape. I sing along with me. The neighbours must be asking each other, how much longer are they all going to be singing Eternal Flame? Quite a while, because \u201cIs this burning an eternal flame?\u201d requires a top C that I still can\u2019t reach.</p> <p>I would like to know whether I hover around the deep notes for psychological reasons, to keep a low profile, or physiological ones, because I have a deep voice.</p> <p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d says Welch. \u201cYou don\u2019t have a deep voice.\u201d (The thickness of a person\u2019s neck determines this, he says, and mine isn\u2019t thick.) Welch motions me to his computer, where a program called <a href=\"https://www.singandsee.com/\" title=\"\">Sing&amp;See</a> visually tracks pitch and reveals that I speak at around G3 (the G below middle C). \u201cTypical for an adult female in western Europe,\u201d he remarks. Though when women wore corsets, their voices were higher, and if I weren\u2019t emancipated, I might be a soprano.</p> <p>\u201cYes, but you\u2019ve got at least two to three octaves above your speaking voice,\u201d Welch says. \u201cGive me a scream.\u201d</p> <p>I do, and Sing&amp;See records it as an A5 \u2013 five notes above the C I cannot find.</p> <p>Getting the sound out is a bit of \u201ca black art\u201d says William Thorpe, who developed Sing&amp;See at Sydney University in the early 2000s. I\u2019m not surprised when Thorpe says he receives many emails from people who were put off singing in childhood \u2013 the silent choir grows \u2013 but are finding their voices in retirement. He himself was brother to a sibling who was \u201cthe musical one\u201d.</p> <p>In my fourth lesson, Wood helps me reach the top C by \u201cthinking down\u201d to create more space. Raising eyebrows also \u201clifts the soft palate\u201d, she adds. I assume the lifting is metaphorical but Wood asks me to yawn. She sounds excited. \u201cBecause of my angle, I can see your soft palate go up!\u201d</p> <p>Singing is full of new intimacies.

      "bodyText": "My singing voice is a part of my body that I have for years disowned. I was a child when I let it go. Of this moment I remember only the bright orange carpet of our lounge, the spiral rug. When someone remarked on my \u201cracket\u201d, I guess my head dropped and floor is all I saw. But as I was eight or nine, and I\u2019m now 47, I can\u2019t be sure. I know only this: in that moment, I shut my mouth to singing. For decades, scarcely a song seeped out. All my life, I have tried to square the longing to sing with the fear of being heard. There have been times \u2013 as a teenager in love with a guitarist, for instance, and at my nan\u2019s funeral \u2013 when I have yearned to join my voice with others\u2019 voices. At birthday celebrations, I latch on to the handful of low notes familiar from speech, like finding a cluster of friends at a party of strangers, and skip every other word. My version goes: \u201cHappy birthday \u2026 Happy birthday \u2026 Happy \u2026 Susan \u2026 you!\u201d Karaoke was invented the year before I was born, but I have never tried it. Instead, I developed a sort of soundless singing, in which the one safe place to do it was in my head. I am only now learning that I had in effect joined a vast, global choir of silent singers, all scarred by some childhood slight and unable to find a home in any song. Mindful of my impediment, I have tried to encourage my children to sing, so I have sung to them \u2013 the exception to my silence \u2013 not as if no one is listening, but as if no one had told me I couldn\u2019t. \u201cMummy has a beautiful voice,\u201d they say. And although this sounds kind rather than truthful, I have decided, after more than three decades of silence, to find and own up to my singing voice \u2013 this part of me that is neither muscle nor bone, that I cannot put a finger on but which engages three-quarters of my torso (according to Anne Karpf, in her book The Human Voice). What are my voice\u2019s qualities? Why do I feel fine speaking in daily life, but phobic about anyone outside my children\u2019s bedrooms hearing me string together two melodic notes? The voice in my head, which I know all too well, is quiet and deep. But if the average vocal range of an adult is two octaves, what might my voice do if given freedom to roam? To find out, I have arranged to meet Eleanor Wood, a singing coach at London\u2019s City Academy. I know that the only way to end my silence is to conjure an expectant audience and constrain myself to keep the appointment. The studio is five minutes from my office, but it is not an easy walk. I sing random notes aloud as I go, but my metaphorical ear is so attuned to my metaphorical voice I have no idea if I am audible to anyone but me. In the tiny piano room the fan is humming, the chairs are creaking. What noise will I make? \u201cWhat if I\u2019m out of tune?\u201d I ask Wood. \u201cDo people ever open their mouths and nothing comes out?\u201d It\u2019s like being at the doctor\u2019s and asking a multitude of questions to delay the inevitable examination. \u201cI\u2019d like a diagnosis of my voice,\u201d I quaver. \u201cWe can totally do that,\u201d says Wood, a classically trained soprano. \u201cFirst we\u2019re just going to use our voices. Wake them up a bit.\u201d She straightens my posture and together we hum a \u201csiren\u201d, from the bottom of our voices to the top. Wood\u2019s voice is clear and strong, whereas mine likes to curl up in small spaces. It easily hides inside hers. But then Wood strikes a key and asks me to find the note alone. \u201cNear!\u201d she says. \u201cPretty near!\u201d We do this exercise trilling \u201clip bubbles\u201d, rolling Rs, and mini-scales, like taking our voices up and down a very short ladder. I try not to flinch at my racket while Wood says \u201cAmazing!\u201d and \u201cAwesome!\u201d and \u201cThere you have it!\u201d I have chosen to sing Manic Monday by the Bangles and Bob Dylan\u2019s Don\u2019t Think Twice, It\u2019s All Right: I\u2019d like to replay a sliver of my teen years with the volume up. Maybe because Wood and I have spent so long making silly noises, I don\u2019t balk when she explains that I have only one voice, and the one that I use to read bedtime stories or answer a phone is the same one that, in a few minutes, I will use to sing. Thankfully, Manic Monday has a range mostly limited to four notes, and is heavy on \u201cspeech quality\u201d, as defined by the legendary speech pathologist Jo Estill \u2013 a style of singing that is close to talking. While Wood plays piano or clicks her fingers, I chant the words, then articulate them more melodically. I hear myself grow louder. There is no line between speech and song \u2013 all speaking voices contain fragments of higher pitches, harmonics \u2013 so if there is a moment when I start to sing, I don\u2019t notice it. I\u2019m just drawing out the pitches from my speech and sustaining them. Besides, I\u2019m distracted by the lyrics. Did people really go to work worrying about whether their beds were made? Afterwards, Wood swivels on her piano stool. \u201cIn terms of a diagnosis, you sound very comfortable singing low notes. The upper range needs exploring. It\u2019s not just about your range, though, but colour and quality, which I would say is very warm. It\u2019s tentative,\u201d Wood says, \u201cbut you\u2019ve got all the bones of a voice.\u201d I feel elated, as if my singing skeleton is coming to life. So it\u2019s a shock to get home and listen to my recording of the lesson. Only Wood\u2019s voice is audible! Mine, which had resonated with appalling volume in my head, is nowhere to be found. I\u2019m a ghost on the tape. Where is my voice? Why does it sound so loud to me but not to anyone else? \u201cI guess we all hear ourselves a little differently,\u201d Wood says diplomatically. According to Christella Antoni, a speech and voice therapist, \u201cWe tend to hear our voice higher than it is, because it is conducted through the skull bones.\u201d But Johan Sundberg, author of The Science of the Singing Voice, says: \u201cOne\u2019s own voice doesn\u2019t sound to others as it sounds to you for the simple reason that your ears are not in front of your mouth.\u201d He says my voice \u201cis clear, with no leakage\u201d. A voice traverses its owner\u2019s body, amplifying our inner dimension for the outside world. \u201cYou were musical before you were anything else,\u201d says Graham Welch, chair of music education at University College London, and author of The Oxford Handbook of Singing. \u201cWhat you\u2019re hearing inside the womb is the melody, the rhythm, the tonal colours.\u201d Apparently, consonants can\u2019t travel through amniotic fluid. \u201cThe voice is one of the first sensorial aspects of contact with the mother,\u201d says Rosine Perelberg, president of the Institute of Psychoanalysis. She mentions Julia Kristeva\u2019s concept of the semiotic, \u201ca sensorial domain which includes sounds and voice of the mother\u201d, and which gets repressed by the realm of rules and laws, Perelberg says. \u201cBut it\u2019s never totally repressed. It survives in different ways. You recovered it when you became a mother, first in private relationships with your own children, and now in public.\u201d Welch has encountered many people who \u201ccarry the psychological burden\u201d of having had their singing criticised in childhood \u2013 what Perelberg describes as \u201ca prohibition\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ve got PhDs on this,\u201d Welch says, waving to shelves laden with heavy volumes containing the stories of other members of the silent choir. \u201cI talk to people in their 80s, and they can tell me about that moment as if it were yesterday.\u201d It\u2019s such a pity because by the age of 11 only 2-3% of children sing out of tune, he says. In my next lesson with City Academy\u2019s Wood, I practise the Bangles\u2019 Eternal Flame. At the end of the hour, I can hit six notes, from middle C to A. The higher notes seem to ring in my head, the lower ones in my chest. I\u2019m learning that I will not find my voice in any one place. But when I sing \u2018\u201cflaaaame\u201d, on that A above middle C, a sound comes out of my mouth that I never knew I could make. It is powerful and secure and true. I don\u2019t always find it, but at least I know it\u2019s there. By the fourth lesson, Eternal Flame is taking shape. I sing all the way back to my desk. I sing (very quietly) in the queue for a sandwich. I sing on my bike and I don\u2019t stop when I see a pedestrian. At yoga, I om with everyone else. I\u2019m like one of those people who are pleased with their work in the gym and want to go everywhere in a muscle tee. At home the children are singing Eternal Flame. The whole house hums with it. I listen to the recording of my latest lesson and my voice is on the tape. I sing along with me. The neighbours must be asking each other, how much longer are they all going to be singing Eternal Flame? Quite a while, because \u201cIs this burning an eternal flame?\u201d requires a top C that I still can\u2019t reach. I would like to know whether I hover around the deep notes for psychological reasons, to keep a low profile, or physiological ones, because I have a deep voice. \u201cNo, no,\u201d says Welch. \u201cYou don\u2019t have a deep voice.\u201d (The thickness of a person\u2019s neck determines this, he says, and mine isn\u2019t thick.) Welch motions me to his computer, where a program called Sing&amp;See visually tracks pitch and reveals that I speak at around G3 (the G below middle C). \u201cTypical for an adult female in western Europe,\u201d he remarks. Though when women wore corsets, their voices were higher, and if I weren\u2019t emancipated, I might be a soprano. \u201cYes, but you\u2019ve got at least two to three octaves above your speaking voice,\u201d Welch says. \u201cGive me a scream.\u201d I do, and Sing&amp;See records it as an A5 \u2013 five notes above the C I cannot find. Getting the sound out is a bit of \u201ca black art\u201d says William Thorpe, who developed Sing&amp;See at Sydney University in the early 2000s. I\u2019m not surprised when Thorpe says he receives many emails from people who were put off singing in childhood \u2013 the silent choir grows \u2013 but are finding their voices in retirement. He himself was brother to a sibling who was \u201cthe musical one\u201d. In my fourth lesson, Wood helps me reach the top C by \u201cthinking down\u201d to create more space. Raising eyebrows also \u201clifts the soft palate\u201d, she adds. I assume the lifting is metaphorical but Wood asks me to yawn. She sounds excited. \u201cBecause of my angle, I can see your soft palate go up!\u201d Singing is full of new intimacies. I am discovering crevices in my skull, canals and hinges that I never knew existed. Singing into my \u201cmask\u201d \u2013 around my nose and sinuses \u2013 helps to land notes. So does \u201ctwanging it\u201d (twang being another of Estill\u2019s six vocal qualities): I can go higher if I sing \u201cNyis this burning nyan eternal flame?\u201d In my fourth lesson, I hit the top C. I can sing all of Eternal Flame apart from the final note where Bangles vocalist Susanna Hoffs goes somewhere I doubt I\u2019ll ever follow. \u201cPaula, boom!\u201d Wood says. Welch doesn\u2019t know why I\u2019m worried. \u201cThere is nothing unusual about your voice. Bog standard,\u201d he says. Great! But if everything is so normal, what makes my voice mine? Well, I\u2019m the only one to have truly heard it. \u201cNo one else has heard all of your voice. Nor will they. The lower-frequency parts go through your body,\u201d Welch explains. We are all, in a way, our own private audience. The voice in our heads and our physical voice \u201care very, very closely related,\u201d according to Welch. \u201cBecause you cannot speak or write without hearing it.\u201d Even when we are listening to another person speak or sing, our vocal folds move in sympathy. \u201cYours are moving now.\u201d I sing Happy Birthday down the phone to my mother. I\u2019m still singing Eternal Flame. In my final lesson, I perform it for the head of singing at City Academy. The kids have started to tell me to shut up, but I can\u2019t. I\u2019m obsessed. I can scream at C6. The kettle beeps at D7. My partner enrols me on a singing session at City Academy where six of the eight other attendees say that as children they were discouraged from singing. After the taster, I join a beginners\u2019 course. I perform Eternal Flame solo to my 12 fellow students. \u201cThe voice in our heads can seem rather controlling,\u201d says psychologist Sally Austen, who herself stopped singing in her teens after family teasing. \u201cYou can never get rid of that voice,\u201d she says.

The asylum seekers did not fancy the village.</p> <p>Residents of Lisdoonvarna in County Clare, on<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ireland\"> Ireland</a>\u2019s west coast, rejected a government plan to settle asylum seekers there in a lopsided vote: 197 against, 15 in favour.</p> <p>Authorities ignored the vote and bussed in dozens of people from Africa, Asia, eastern Europe and the Middle East to a hastily converted hotel in April 2018. The newcomers feared hostility and isolation in a windswept village with few amenities and poor transport links.</p> <p>It was a forced union laden with irony: Lisdoonvarna was famous for a venerable <a href=\"https://www.matchmakerireland.com/\">matchmaking festival</a> that draws tens of thousands of visitors each September.</p> <p>Now, 16 months later and with a new festival under way, it turns out that on one level the match has largely worked: villagers and asylum seekers have warmed to each other.</p> <p>\u201cThey are very active in the community and are very well-liked,\u201d said Elsha Daly, the daughter of Willie Daly, Lisdoonvarna\u2019s official matchmaker. \u201cPeople here have become very accepting of different cultures.\u201d Other residents \u2013 business owners, taxi drivers, older people \u2013 echoed the sentiment.</p> <p>The new arrivals said initial anxiety had turned to relief as they encountered friendliness and generosity. Emboldened, several plan to attend the matchmaking festival, which started on Saturday and continues until the end of September.</p> <p>\u201cPeople are good to me. They make me feel welcome,\u201d said Mputu Wabalekelayi, 30, from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The single mother of two is open to romance. \u201cI want to see the music and dancing. Sharing is good. Maybe I\u2019ll meet somebody.\u201d</p> <p>Sayed Ali, 20, who arrived from Bahrain, said rudimentary English would not deter him from socialising. \u201cPeople say hello.

      "bodyText": "It seemed a match made in hell. The village did not fancy the asylum seekers. The asylum seekers did not fancy the village. Residents of Lisdoonvarna in County Clare, on Ireland\u2019s west coast, rejected a government plan to settle asylum seekers there in a lopsided vote: 197 against, 15 in favour. Authorities ignored the vote and bussed in dozens of people from Africa, Asia, eastern Europe and the Middle East to a hastily converted hotel in April 2018. The newcomers feared hostility and isolation in a windswept village with few amenities and poor transport links. It was a forced union laden with irony: Lisdoonvarna was famous for a venerable matchmaking festival that draws tens of thousands of visitors each September. Now, 16 months later and with a new festival under way, it turns out that on one level the match has largely worked: villagers and asylum seekers have warmed to each other. \u201cThey are very active in the community and are very well-liked,\u201d said Elsha Daly, the daughter of Willie Daly, Lisdoonvarna\u2019s official matchmaker. \u201cPeople here have become very accepting of different cultures.\u201d Other residents \u2013 business owners, taxi drivers, older people \u2013 echoed the sentiment. The new arrivals said initial anxiety had turned to relief as they encountered friendliness and generosity. Emboldened, several plan to attend the matchmaking festival, which started on Saturday and continues until the end of September. \u201cPeople are good to me. They make me feel welcome,\u201d said Mputu Wabalekelayi, 30, from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The single mother of two is open to romance. \u201cI want to see the music and dancing. Sharing is good. Maybe I\u2019ll meet somebody.\u201d Sayed Ali, 20, who arrived from Bahrain, said rudimentary English would not deter him from socialising. \u201cPeople say hello. I feel safe. It would be nice to meet girls.\u201d Ireland\u2019s policy of accommodating asylum seekers in rural hotels \u2013 a response to overcrowding at shelters in Dublin \u2013 has prompted protests from residents who cite cultural differences and strain on public services. Arsonists in Roosky, County Roscommon, twice attacked an empty hotel earmarked for asylum seekers. Authorities cancelled the move. Lisdoonvarna, in contrast, has channelled the spirit of its festival. Launched 160 years ago to find wives for farmers, it has broadened into a global, LGBTQ+ friendly event for singletons and music lovers. \u201cSome matches are made in heaven but the best ones are made in Lisdoonvarna,\u201d says the slogan. The 107 asylum seekers at the King Thomond, a three-star regency-style hotel just outside the village, have settled into the community without backlash. The children attend schools and many parents have found work. Volunteers from Lisdoonvarna and neighbouring villages visit the hotel to teach knitting, host coffee mornings and help with transport. \u201cThe people are good, decent,\u201d said Smoyo, 47, a Zimbabwean who declined to give her last name. With her meagre cleaner\u2019s wage she half-joked about storming the festival with a friend. \u201cWe are looking forward to getting some men.\u201d Several factors smoothed the integration. A spa town, Lisdoonvarna is accustomed to foreigners. Residents sympathetic to hosting people fleeing persecution appear to have been underrepresented in the vote. Increased school enrolment should help Lisdoonvarna avert the school closures that afflict other rural communities with dwindling populations. Hotels, B&amp;Bs and restaurants are grateful to have workers willing to scrub pots and toilets \u2013 jobs difficult to fill. Asylum centres can be grim, with bad food and surly staff, but the King Thomond is well-run, said Orla Ni Eili of the Clare Immigrant Support Centre. Asylum seekers there endorsed that. Willie Daly, a fourth-generation matchmaker credited with 3,000 marriages, relished the prospect of matching asylum seekers with some of the estimated 40,000 visitors expected to pack the village in coming weeks. He meets clients in the Matchmaker bar and notes their details in a leather-bound folder tied with shoelace known as \u201cthe lucky book\u201d.

Ireland\u2019s system of \u201cdirect provision\u201d satisfies material needs but traps asylum seekers in a bureaucratic limbo of dependence and uncertainty about their fate that can last years, causing anxiety, stress and depression, according to critics. Ending up in rural areas \u2013 a money-saving tactic for the state, which rents hotels on the verge of closure \u2013 can compound feelings of isolation and frustration. \u201cI\u2019m stuck, not happy,\u201d said a woman who fled violence in eastern Europe.

Like Yorgos Lanthimos (his closest contemporary), he makes work that inhabits a social landscape of strangeness, where conversations jump from the candid to the downright inappropriate and characters remain a mystery, sometimes even to themselves. We wouldn\u2019t want to live in the world Larrain shows us. But his films are so good they convince us that we do.</p> <p>Over the last decade or so, the Chilean director has told stories about demented John Travolta impersonators (Tony Manero), disgraced Catholic priests (The Club) and a grief-stricken First Lady (Jackie). And while I confess that I found Ema to be a notch down on his best work, it\u2019s still hugely distinctive and daring and may well be a grower. Past evidence suggests that Larrain\u2019s films infect us like a virus. We leave the cinema feeling nice and cool. Then two days later we\u2019re burning up.</p> <p>Pungently set in the port city of Valparaiso (ferry rides; funiculars), Larrain\u2019s latest - an opaque thriller of sorts - narrows in on Ema (Mariana Di Girolamo) and Gaston (Gael Garcia Bernal), an estranged married couple who still work together down at the local dance company. Each blames the other for abandoning their adoptive son Polo, who we understand has now been returned to the orphanage. They loved Polo so much that it breaks their hearts not to have him around - even if yes, the kid could be quite the handful at times. One day he burned down the house, and torched his aunt\u2019s face and shut the dog inside the freezer.</p> <p>Ema\u2019s woozy, unsettling opening leads us to expect a tale along the lines of We Need to Talk About Kevin, in which a pair of middle-class parents fall prey to a pocket psychopath. And yet Larrain takes a perverse delight in wrong-footing his audience - this time, perhaps, too much delight. So he spins us around and leads us off through the dark, steadfastly refusing to introduce us to Polo. Without the opportunity to study the defendant there\u2019s no real way of knowing what prompted his crimes (or, for that matter, whether he is even to blame). Is Polo a monster or are there other factors at play? Maybe his parents are responsible; maybe they made him what he is.</p> <p>Certainly there is something faintly monstrous about both Ema and Gaston, although again this could be because they are knackered and miserable and warped by grief. They taunt each other mercilessly, Both - openly, defiantly - are seeing other people. It\u2019s clear that these two still love one another but the connective tissue is torn; some basic human kindness has gone missing.</p> <p>This, of course, isn\u2019t all that\u2019s missing. Polo is Larrain\u2019s crafty equivalent of Chekhov\u2019s gun on the mantelpiece; the invisible third point in this disturbing love triangle who, even by his absence, defines the other two parties, both individually and as a couple. Happily the film longs for Polo just as much as they do. And cleverly, secretively it is preparing quite the welcome.</p>",

Past evidence suggests that Larrain\u2019s films infect us like a virus. We leave the cinema feeling nice and cool. Then two days later we\u2019re burning up. Pungently set in the port city of Valparaiso (ferry rides; funiculars), Larrain\u2019s latest - an opaque thriller of sorts - narrows in on Ema (Mariana Di Girolamo) and Gaston (Gael Garcia Bernal), an estranged married couple who still work together down at the local dance company. Each blames the other for abandoning their adoptive son Polo, who we understand has now been returned to the orphanage. They loved Polo so much that it breaks their hearts not to have him around - even if yes, the kid could be quite the handful at times. One day he burned down the house, and torched his aunt\u2019s face and shut the dog inside the freezer. Ema\u2019s woozy, unsettling opening leads us to expect a tale along the lines of We Need to Talk About Kevin, in which a pair of middle-class parents fall prey to a pocket psychopath. And yet Larrain takes a perverse delight in wrong-footing his audience - this time, perhaps, too much delight. So he spins us around and leads us off through the dark, steadfastly refusing to introduce us to Polo. Without the opportunity to study the defendant there\u2019s no real way of knowing what prompted his crimes (or, for that matter, whether he is even to blame). Is Polo a monster or are there other factors at play? Maybe his parents are responsible; maybe they made him what he is. Certainly there is something faintly monstrous about both Ema and Gaston, although again this could be because they are knackered and miserable and warped by grief. They taunt each other mercilessly, Both - openly, defiantly - are seeing other people. It\u2019s clear that these two still love one another but the connective tissue is torn; some basic human kindness has gone missing. This, of course, isn\u2019t all that\u2019s missing. Polo is Larrain\u2019s crafty equivalent of Chekhov\u2019s gun on the mantelpiece; the invisible third point in this disturbing love triangle who, even by his absence, defines the other two parties, both individually and as a couple. Happily the film longs for Polo just as much as they do. And cleverly, secretively it is preparing quite the welcome.",

My mother still refers to this as the time I ran away from home.\u201d</p> <p>The show, which ran for 110 episodes between 1974 and 1978, made Harper, in the guise of Rhoda Morgenstern, a model for many young women wanting to make their own way in life. She was an outgoing and outspoken career girl, in an era when women in sitcoms were mainly the homebody addressees of \u201cHoney, I\u2019m home\u201d. Harper was involved in the women\u2019s liberation movement in the 1970s, and a campaigner for the Equal Rights Amendment.</p> <p>The character of Rhoda, who was to win Harper four Primetime Emmys, first appeared in The Mary Tyler Moore Show in 1970 as best friend to Mary Richards, played by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jan/25/mary-tyler-moore-obituary\" title=\"\">Moore</a>. The characters served as perfect foils for one another: the quietly spoken, elegant midwesterner Mary, a TV producer, was calm and rational, whereas the bold and blunt Jewish New Yorker Rhoda, a window dresser, was impulsive and passionate. Mary went in for nicely tailored trouser suits, while Rhoda wore bohemian kaftans, headscarves and layers of chunky costume jewellery. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJO0I52w5Pw\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wJO0I52w5Pw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Rhoda\u2019s Wedding, 1974</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Harper was born into a Catholic family in the small town of Suffern, New York.

      "bodyText": "\u201cMy name is Rhoda Morgenstern. I was born in the Bronx, New York, in December 1941. I\u2019ve always felt responsible for World War II.\u201d These voiceover lines began each episode of the television sitcom Rhoda, in which the title character was played with great gusto and wit by Valerie Harper, who has died of cancer aged 80. \u201cThe first thing I remember liking that liked me back was food,\u201d the introduction continued. \u201cI had a bad puberty. It lasted 17 years \u2026 I decided to move out of the house when I was 24. My mother still refers to this as the time I ran away from home.\u201d The show, which ran for 110 episodes between 1974 and 1978, made Harper, in the guise of Rhoda Morgenstern, a model for many young women wanting to make their own way in life. She was an outgoing and outspoken career girl, in an era when women in sitcoms were mainly the homebody addressees of \u201cHoney, I\u2019m home\u201d. Harper was involved in the women\u2019s liberation movement in the 1970s, and a campaigner for the Equal Rights Amendment. The character of Rhoda, who was to win Harper four Primetime Emmys, first appeared in The Mary Tyler Moore Show in 1970 as best friend to Mary Richards, played by Moore. The characters served as perfect foils for one another: the quietly spoken, elegant midwesterner Mary, a TV producer, was calm and rational, whereas the bold and blunt Jewish New Yorker Rhoda, a window dresser, was impulsive and passionate. Mary went in for nicely tailored trouser suits, while Rhoda wore bohemian kaftans, headscarves and layers of chunky costume jewellery. Harper was born into a Catholic family in the small town of Suffern, New York. Her Canadian mother, Iva (nee McConnell), was a nurse, and her father, Howard Harper, a lighting salesman. Because of her father\u2019s peripatetic work, Harper went to many schools throughout the US before studying ballet and acting in New York City. She got her first breaks as a chorus girl in the Broadway musicals Li\u2019l Abner (1959), Take Me Along (1960), Wildcat (1961) and Subways Are for Sleeping (1962). The always quick-witted Harper then joined the Second City improvisation theatre in Chicago, where she met Dick Schaal, a fellow performer, whom she married in 1965. In 1970, while Harper was doing theatre in Los Angeles, a casting director for CBS saw her and invited her to audition for Rhoda in The Mary Tyler Moore Show. Harper made such an impression that she was offered the spin-off series in 1974. Being committed to Rhoda for four years left her little time to do anything else. But just before the series took off, she had her first credited role in a feature film as Consuela, the fiery, cheating wife Consuela of a cop (Alan Arkin) in Freebie and the Bean (1974). After the run of Rhoda ended, Harper appeared in three dud films in showy supporting roles: Chapter Two (1979), The Last Married Couple in America (1980) and Blame It On Rio (1984). But she was most active on television. Apart from regularly popping in as Rhoda on The Mary Tyler Moore Show, she starred in another sitcom called Valerie, playing the mother of three teenage boys whose husband, an airline pilot, is away most of the time.

      "body": "<p>This week is set to be a historic one in Westminster, as MPs attempt to legislate to stop a no-deal Brexit and government whips go into overdrive to stem a rebellion in the House of Commons. A spending review and possible attempts to stop the prorogation of parliament are in the mix as well. Here\u2019s how the week is expected to play out:</p> \n<h2>Monday</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b146305d-32c1-4dc9-9f4d-b60ce025264f\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>At 11pm UK time on 31 October the UK would, by default, become a \u201cthird country\u201d in terms of relations with the EU, with no overarching post-Brexit plan in place and no transition period. The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the \u00a339bn divorce payment.</p>\n    <p>The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods.</p>\n    <p>The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports \u2013 making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO \u201cmost favoured nation\u201d rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.<br></p>\n    <p>WTO rules only cover goods \u2013 they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK\u2019s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.<br></p>\n    <p>Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article 24 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to 10 years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article 24 unilaterally \u2013 the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK\u2019s trading relationship.<br></p>\n    <p>The director general of the WTO, Roberto Azev\u00eado, has <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/economics-and-finance/jumping-from-league-one-to-league-three-wto-insiders-scathing-assessments-of-a-wto-brexit\">told Prospect magazine</a> that \u201cin simple factual terms in this scenario, you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the UK and EU where currently there are none\u201d.</p>\n    <p>Until some agreements are in place, a no-deal scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses \u2013 eg the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europe after 31 October if there is no deal. Those arguing for a \u201cmanaged\u201d no deal envisage that a range of smaller, sector-by-sector, bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.</p>\n    <p><b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a></b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>A meeting due to take place between Boris Johnson and former Conservative cabinet ministers including Philip Hammond and David Gauke, was cancelled on Sunday night.

      "body": "<p>Dutch author <a href=\"http://www.hermankoch.com/\" title=\"\">Herman Koch</a> is best known for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jul/29/the-dinner-herman-koch-review\" title=\"\"><em>The Dinner</em></a>, his 2012 global bestseller about a meal at a swanky restaurant that descends into a slanging match. The novel was notable for its relentless nastiness: at its heart is a horrific act of teenage violence (which the meal has been convened to discuss), and the adults are all equally ghastly. This grimness may be the best explanation for its success: there was a sense that Koch was holding up a mirror to bourgeois life, and revealing \u2013 none too subtly \u2013 the darkness at its heart.</p> <p>Koch\u2019s latest novel is set in a broadly similar milieu. Narrator Robert Walter is the mayor of Amsterdam (one of the diners in <em>The Dinner</em> was a famous politician). Everything about his life seems correct, well-ordered: he is contentedly married, with a delightful teenage daughter, and his professional life involves plenty of hobnobbing with the rich and famous (Bill Clinton, he reports, is a \u201cturbo-charged version of myself\u201d). Aside from an intense aversion to wind turbines, Robert appears to have few convictions or principles: his skill lies in that old politicians\u2019 trick \u2013 telling people what they want to hear. Yet while he is cynical, you can\u2019t help warming to him \u2013 and he\u2019s certainly more sympathetic than any of the characters in <em>The Dinner</em>.</p> <p>Yet, inevitably, a serpent steals into paradise. At the city\u2019s new year bash, Robert spots his wife, Sylvia, chatting with an unprepossessing alderman. The alderman says something that makes Sylvia laugh and, for a split-second, his hand rests on her elbow. This is the only prompt that Robert\u2019s imagination needs: he is instantly cast into a world of suspicion. Are Sylvia and the alderman having an affair? On the surface, it seems unlikely, but soon Robert is devoting every waking moment to mentally pursuing this possibility.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jul/29/the-dinner-herman-koch-review\">The Dinner by Herman Koch \u2013 review</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As an exploration of pathological jealousy, <em>The Ditch</em> is largely convincing. Koch is especially good at inhabiting Robert\u2019s looking-glass world, in which every little thing becomes grounds for suspicion. On a weekend break to Paris, Sylvia affectionately teases her husband. \u201cWould she still tease me (and smile and wink),\u201d he asks, \u201cif she were having an affair with Maarten van Hoogstraten?\u201d But then a darker thought intrudes: is her friendliness merely a \u201cfive-star performance\u201d, put on for the express purposes of allaying his suspicion? At a certain point, jealousy becomes almost indistinguishable from comedy in the lengths to which it goes to distort reality.</p> <p>The focus on Robert\u2019s jealousy, however, proves short-lived. Other plotlines come to the fore: the imminent deaths of Robert\u2019s ageing parents; a possible scandal from his past. His jealousy, it becomes clear, had a defensive function: it was a means to distract him from more pressing (and real) concerns. Yet this realisation doesn\u2019t particularly help the novel. The various strands never fully cohere, and in an apparent effort to make them do so, Koch makes his characters do implausible things. Nothing in the book\u2019s latter stages proves as compelling as the paranoia it initially explored. <em>The Ditch</em>, you can\u2019t help feeling, would have been more successful had it cleaved more tightly to its opening theme.</p> <p><em>\u2022 The Ditch</em> by Herman Koch (translated by Sam Garrett) is published by Picador (\u00a314.99).

      "bodyText": "Dutch author Herman Koch is best known for The Dinner, his 2012 global bestseller about a meal at a swanky restaurant that descends into a slanging match. The novel was notable for its relentless nastiness: at its heart is a horrific act of teenage violence (which the meal has been convened to discuss), and the adults are all equally ghastly. This grimness may be the best explanation for its success: there was a sense that Koch was holding up a mirror to bourgeois life, and revealing \u2013 none too subtly \u2013 the darkness at its heart. Koch\u2019s latest novel is set in a broadly similar milieu. Narrator Robert Walter is the mayor of Amsterdam (one of the diners in The Dinner was a famous politician). Everything about his life seems correct, well-ordered: he is contentedly married, with a delightful teenage daughter, and his professional life involves plenty of hobnobbing with the rich and famous (Bill Clinton, he reports, is a \u201cturbo-charged version of myself\u201d). Aside from an intense aversion to wind turbines, Robert appears to have few convictions or principles: his skill lies in that old politicians\u2019 trick \u2013 telling people what they want to hear. Yet while he is cynical, you can\u2019t help warming to him \u2013 and he\u2019s certainly more sympathetic than any of the characters in The Dinner. Yet, inevitably, a serpent steals into paradise. At the city\u2019s new year bash, Robert spots his wife, Sylvia, chatting with an unprepossessing alderman. The alderman says something that makes Sylvia laugh and, for a split-second, his hand rests on her elbow. This is the only prompt that Robert\u2019s imagination needs: he is instantly cast into a world of suspicion. Are Sylvia and the alderman having an affair? On the surface, it seems unlikely, but soon Robert is devoting every waking moment to mentally pursuing this possibility. As an exploration of pathological jealousy, The Ditch is largely convincing. Koch is especially good at inhabiting Robert\u2019s looking-glass world, in which every little thing becomes grounds for suspicion. On a weekend break to Paris, Sylvia affectionately teases her husband. \u201cWould she still tease me (and smile and wink),\u201d he asks, \u201cif she were having an affair with Maarten van Hoogstraten?\u201d But then a darker thought intrudes: is her friendliness merely a \u201cfive-star performance\u201d, put on for the express purposes of allaying his suspicion? At a certain point, jealousy becomes almost indistinguishable from comedy in the lengths to which it goes to distort reality. The focus on Robert\u2019s jealousy, however, proves short-lived. Other plotlines come to the fore: the imminent deaths of Robert\u2019s ageing parents; a possible scandal from his past. His jealousy, it becomes clear, had a defensive function: it was a means to distract him from more pressing (and real) concerns. Yet this realisation doesn\u2019t particularly help the novel. The various strands never fully cohere, and in an apparent effort to make them do so, Koch makes his characters do implausible things. Nothing in the book\u2019s latter stages proves as compelling as the paranoia it initially explored. The Ditch, you can\u2019t help feeling, would have been more successful had it cleaved more tightly to its opening theme. \u2022 The Ditch by Herman Koch (translated by Sam Garrett) is published by Picador (\u00a314.99).

      "body": "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/oct/13/hand-me-downs-clothes-pass-on-fathers-sons\" title=\"\">Cathal McAteer</a>, the founder of cult brand Folk, is trying on pieces from his new line, It\u2019s All Good Folk, at his central London shop and HQ. He\u2019s excited about the new collection. The first pieces went into John Lewis\u2019s White City store that morning and he is visibly chuffed. He\u2019s already wearing the trouser samples, which will go on sale in November, and it looks like he\u2019ll be living in them for a while. He\u2019s his own best customer. \u201cI personally like a dishevelled, worn garment,\u201d he says. \u201cI like that patina things take on when they look well-worn.\u201d</p> <p>The tagline for the collection made exclusively for sale in John Lewis and Folk, is \u201cWear it out\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s not fast fashion,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s important that people wear the garments out.\u201d Folk already repairs clothes that are returned if they have been damaged. \u201cIf they can be repaired or upcycled, then the team will make sure that happens,\u201d he says. The same will be true for It\u2019s All Good Folk. \u201cIf something needs a minor repair we will replace the garment, if need be, then we can repair it and resell it, or we can make a charitable donation so it can be used and worn again.\u201d</p> <p>Making clothes last longer is important, but it is only part of the story. Fashion has become an industry that even the people who work in it feel increasingly uneasy about. Designers and supply-chain managers like those in McAteer\u2019s team are all too aware of news about microplastic-contaminated rain in remote parts of the world, about fashion brands burning clothes they can\u2019t sell, and the unfathomable amounts of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/21/fashion-g7-summit-sustainability-kering-inditex-macron\" title=\"\">waste and pollution</a> created by the production of fashion and textiles.</p> <p>McAteer\u2019s team are keen to drive change within the business. When John Lewis approached Folk to collaborate on a menswear line, it made sense to do things a little differently and rethink the way the collection is sourced and made. He employed the services of sustainability consultant Dan Holmes. \u201cWe have been studying how we can make our supply chain, suppliers and ourselves do things better,\u201d said McAteer. The result has motivated the team and re-energised the whole business.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"924038f93541d0937cf5ba38e12078069d925ed0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/924038f93541d0937cf5ba38e12078069d925ed0/0_0_4032_5056/797.jpg\" alt=\"Shirt \u00a380, organic cotton jacket \u00a3150, and organic cotton trousers \u00a395, all from It\u2019s All Good Folk at johnlewis.com.\" width=\"797\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shirt<strong> </strong>\u00a380,<strong> </strong>organic cotton jacket<strong> </strong>\u00a3150,<strong> </strong>and<strong> </strong>organic<strong> </strong>cotton<strong> </strong>trousers<strong> </strong>\u00a395, all from It\u2019s All Good Folk at <a href=\"http://johnlewis.com\">johnlewis.com</a>.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Newby/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A lot of it made both common and business sense, like making sure factories were close to fabric suppliers so they were no longer shipping a material from, say, Japan to Poland, to cut down on air miles. \u201cIt\u2019s always a balance,\u201d says Holmes. \u201cIs a recycled fibre better than organic? Is organic better than BCI \u2013 which is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/feb/22/eco-guide-to-cleaner-cotton\" title=\"\">Better Cotton Initiative</a>? It\u2019s all about trade-offs. Is the focus on ocean plastic or climate change?\u201d These are the questions all brands \u2013 big or small \u2013 should be asking. But there are no easy answers or quick fixes. \u201cThere are definitely people doing it much better,\u201d says McAteer. This is a starting point. The whole team is really excited about the fabrics we\u2019ve chosen to use, from BCI cottons to the organic cottons, recycled nylons, polyesters. It is definitely positive and we are pretty happy.\u201d</p> <p>Rethinking materials and sourcing is all very well, but it still doesn\u2019t address the issue that we are fundamentally making too many clothes. That\u2019s why McAteer is so determined to communicate the \u201cwear it out\u201d message to ensure that nothing ends up being worn a few times before ending up in landfill.</p> <p>He shows me the video he made to promote the new collection and its underlying message. It was filmed in Glasgow, inspired by the early days of Folk, when he and a couple of friends would go on a road trip and take pictures. It perfectly encapsulates the Folk spirit \u2013 utilitarian clothes to have a good time in. It\u2019s the details that are all important: the seams designed to flatter the lines of the body, the subtle logo printed on the side of a jacket, the fit that allows you to move.</p> <p><em><strong>Cathal McAteer</strong></em> grew up in Cumbernauld, outside Glasgow, in the 1980s, with little interest in school and an obsession with clothes and design. He got himself a milk round at 12 so that he could save up money to buy cool stuff he was into, and, by the time he was 16, he was working in Glasgow\u2019s cult designer boutique, Ichi Ni San.</p> <p>In 1990, Glasgow was the City of Culture (the <em>Independent</em> dubbed it \u201cCity of Couture\u201d) and was enjoying its moment in the style spotlight with a thriving music and fashion scene. McAteer was at its epicentre, modelling for the store and soon travelling to the shows in London and Paris, in search of new collections to sell. Already, he was dreaming of his own shop and label.</p> <p>He moved to London in the late 1990s and, after a few years working for brands including Nicole Farhi, he was convinced there was a niche for a new label for people like him and his friends. In 2001, Folk was born. The name was suggested by a friend \u2013 the perfect unassuming tag for a quietly cool Modern British brand that was to gain a following of people in the know, tuned into the worlds of music, art and design, as well as the finer details of utility tailoring.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I really like the patina that clothes take on when they are well-worn</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Eighteen years on, Folk has grown a loyal and dedicated following. Womenswear was introduced in 2012 along with accessories, shoes and the odd bit of furniture and a selection of other products that have caught McAteer\u2019s eye and share his values. There are now five stores and regular collaborations with artists, designers and musicians.</p> <p>The collaboration with John Lewis meant McAteer had to make sure his manufacturers were signed up to the partnership\u2019s Responsible Sourcing Code of Practice that sets out expectations on pay, working hours, child labour, worker rights and the right to freedom of association as well as responsible sourcing of materials, with factories being audited by third-party companies. It meant asking some of his suppliers who weren\u2019t already on the list to sign up, which he says is due diligence and good for them, too.</p> <p>While you could argue that if Folk is serious about reducing its impact, it wouldn\u2019t be expanding with a new collection in 12 John Lewis stores, but fashion is a business and McAteer wants to grow in a measured way. The irony is, the brand now has a greater access to more sustainably sourced materials which were previously too expensive for him to buy in smaller quantities.</p> <p>McAteer doesn\u2019t believe people should pay more just because a product is made in a more sustainable way. That, surely, should be standard. Through economies of scale, It\u2019s All Good Folk is cheaper than the main Folk line. A print shirt is \u00a375, while a T-shirt made from <a href=\"https://www.global-standard.org/\" title=\"\">Global Organic Textile Standards</a> (GOTS)-certified organic cotton is \u00a340.</p> <p>As he zips up his minimalist twist on a classic MA1 jacket, which is made of recycled polyester, he talks me through the collection. All the pieces are based on archive favourites, redesigned for today \u2013 which means not just the fabrications but the styling, too. There\u2019s a shirt that was originally made in cotton but has been reimagined in a new low impact viscose called EcoVera. The original version felt stiffer, this one has a lovely drapey feel to it.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s all Good Folk is designed with the Folk ethos at heart \u2013 that\u2019s unrestrictive clothes designed beautifully with every detail marked off,\u201d says McAteer. \u201cAnd then we apply this new ethos in that we make these garments in the best possible way, with a trusted manufacturer, using fabrics that are locally sourced next to the manufacturer in great factories. And we will make those garments as clean as possible. We will be scrutinised. But let\u2019s do the best we can\u2026 we\u2019re asking all the questions.\u201d</p>",

The same will be true for It\u2019s All Good Folk. \u201cIf something needs a minor repair we will replace the garment, if need be, then we can repair it and resell it, or we can make a charitable donation so it can be used and worn again.\u201d Making clothes last longer is important, but it is only part of the story. Fashion has become an industry that even the people who work in it feel increasingly uneasy about. Designers and supply-chain managers like those in McAteer\u2019s team are all too aware of news about microplastic-contaminated rain in remote parts of the world, about fashion brands burning clothes they can\u2019t sell, and the unfathomable amounts of waste and pollution created by the production of fashion and textiles. McAteer\u2019s team are keen to drive change within the business. When John Lewis approached Folk to collaborate on a menswear line, it made sense to do things a little differently and rethink the way the collection is sourced and made. He employed the services of sustainability consultant Dan Holmes. \u201cWe have been studying how we can make our supply chain, suppliers and ourselves do things better,\u201d said McAteer. The result has motivated the team and re-energised the whole business. A lot of it made both common and business sense, like making sure factories were close to fabric suppliers so they were no longer shipping a material from, say, Japan to Poland, to cut down on air miles. \u201cIt\u2019s always a balance,\u201d says Holmes. \u201cIs a recycled fibre better than organic? Is organic better than BCI \u2013 which is Better Cotton Initiative? It\u2019s all about trade-offs. Is the focus on ocean plastic or climate change?\u201d These are the questions all brands \u2013 big or small \u2013 should be asking. But there are no easy answers or quick fixes. \u201cThere are definitely people doing it much better,\u201d says McAteer. This is a starting point. The whole team is really excited about the fabrics we\u2019ve chosen to use, from BCI cottons to the organic cottons, recycled nylons, polyesters. It is definitely positive and we are pretty happy.\u201d Rethinking materials and sourcing is all very well, but it still doesn\u2019t address the issue that we are fundamentally making too many clothes. That\u2019s why McAteer is so determined to communicate the \u201cwear it out\u201d message to ensure that nothing ends up being worn a few times before ending up in landfill. He shows me the video he made to promote the new collection and its underlying message. It was filmed in Glasgow, inspired by the early days of Folk, when he and a couple of friends would go on a road trip and take pictures. It perfectly encapsulates the Folk spirit \u2013 utilitarian clothes to have a good time in. It\u2019s the details that are all important: the seams designed to flatter the lines of the body, the subtle logo printed on the side of a jacket, the fit that allows you to move. Cathal McAteer grew up in Cumbernauld, outside Glasgow, in the 1980s, with little interest in school and an obsession with clothes and design. He got himself a milk round at 12 so that he could save up money to buy cool stuff he was into, and, by the time he was 16, he was working in Glasgow\u2019s cult designer boutique, Ichi Ni San. In 1990, Glasgow was the City of Culture (the Independent dubbed it \u201cCity of Couture\u201d) and was enjoying its moment in the style spotlight with a thriving music and fashion scene. McAteer was at its epicentre, modelling for the store and soon travelling to the shows in London and Paris, in search of new collections to sell. Already, he was dreaming of his own shop and label. He moved to London in the late 1990s and, after a few years working for brands including Nicole Farhi, he was convinced there was a niche for a new label for people like him and his friends. In 2001, Folk was born. The name was suggested by a friend \u2013 the perfect unassuming tag for a quietly cool Modern British brand that was to gain a following of people in the know, tuned into the worlds of music, art and design, as well as the finer details of utility tailoring. Eighteen years on, Folk has grown a loyal and dedicated following. Womenswear was introduced in 2012 along with accessories, shoes and the odd bit of furniture and a selection of other products that have caught McAteer\u2019s eye and share his values. There are now five stores and regular collaborations with artists, designers and musicians. The collaboration with John Lewis meant McAteer had to make sure his manufacturers were signed up to the partnership\u2019s Responsible Sourcing Code of Practice that sets out expectations on pay, working hours, child labour, worker rights and the right to freedom of association as well as responsible sourcing of materials, with factories being audited by third-party companies. It meant asking some of his suppliers who weren\u2019t already on the list to sign up, which he says is due diligence and good for them, too. While you could argue that if Folk is serious about reducing its impact, it wouldn\u2019t be expanding with a new collection in 12 John Lewis stores, but fashion is a business and McAteer wants to grow in a measured way. The irony is, the brand now has a greater access to more sustainably sourced materials which were previously too expensive for him to buy in smaller quantities. McAteer doesn\u2019t believe people should pay more just because a product is made in a more sustainable way. That, surely, should be standard. Through economies of scale, It\u2019s All Good Folk is cheaper than the main Folk line. A print shirt is \u00a375, while a T-shirt made from Global Organic Textile Standards (GOTS)-certified organic cotton is \u00a340. As he zips up his minimalist twist on a classic MA1 jacket, which is made of recycled polyester, he talks me through the collection. All the pieces are based on archive favourites, redesigned for today \u2013 which means not just the fabrications but the styling, too. There\u2019s a shirt that was originally made in cotton but has been reimagined in a new low impact viscose called EcoVera. The original version felt stiffer, this one has a lovely drapey feel to it. \u201cIt\u2019s all Good Folk is designed with the Folk ethos at heart \u2013 that\u2019s unrestrictive clothes designed beautifully with every detail marked off,\u201d says McAteer. \u201cAnd then we apply this new ethos in that we make these garments in the best possible way, with a trusted manufacturer, using fabrics that are locally sourced next to the manufacturer in great factories. And we will make those garments as clean as possible. We will be scrutinised. But let\u2019s do the best we can\u2026 we\u2019re asking all the questions.\u201d",

The Vixens have placed her under much closer scrutiny this time around and she has just four to her name to half-time. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/9Netball/status/1168008785941516288\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">HUGE intercept, then straight to the other end of the court! \ud83d\udc40<br><br>WATCH: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Channel9?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Channel9</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/9Netball?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#9Netball</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/9WWOS?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#9WWOS</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/4iTtUlULJs\">pic.twitter.com/4iTtUlULJs</a></p>&mdash; 9Netball (@9Netball) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/9Netball/status/1168008785941516288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 1, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d6b3f888f081c5d7489d99e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-01T03:50:50.717Z\">4.50am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Super Netball: Q2: 5 mins remaining: Vixens 29-19 Magpies - </strong>This second quarter is much more even than the first but the Vixens are matching everything the Magpies can throw at them, piecing their way through the visiting defence with precision.

      "bodyText": "So a dramatic end to Sportwatch! (who needs AFL, right guys?) Australia start their Basketball World Cup campaign with a solid 16-point Group H win, the final scoreline masking a game that was very much in contention, especially after a big third-quarter shock from the world No 23 side, Canada. Before that, a dramatic day in the NRL as well, with Aidan Sezer sinking three field goals to break Cronulla hearts in extra-time. The Raiders one-point win enough for them to leapfrog Manly into the top four, while it leaves the Sharks looking nervously over their shoulders. Wests thumping win over the Dragons now sets up a huge final round winner-takes-all Cronulla-Wests Tigers clash. It will be a cracker. In the Super Netball, the Vixens booked a preliminary final date with the Swifts after an imposing Melbourne derby win over the Magpies, and of course there was all the drama from the US Open overnight, including the bundling out of Nick Kyrgios. Thanks as always for your company. And that\u2019s Sportwatch! Matthew Dellavedova with 24 points, Chris Goulding with 16 and Patty Mills with 15, but there wasn\u2019t a bad player in Boomers green &amp; gold, with Joe Ingles his usual selfless self, with a raft of important assists and Andrew Bogut a huge presence in defence. They\u2019ll be relieved on the team bus tonight. Cobwebs blown out - no apparent injury concerns, and they\u2019re 1/1 unscathed, Australia. Phew. You\u2019d look at the score and think it was comfortable for the Boomers, but ask a nervous fan twenty minutes ago and it was anything but. Canada came out and obliterated the Boomers across the opening ten minutes of that second half, but in the end it was the old heads that calmed the nerves. Australia with two many game winners - no surprise given the NBA big-game experience of championship winners like Bogut, Dellavedova. It\u2019s an important first Group H win for the Boomers who face Senegal in two days time before the big showdown with Lithuania on 5 September. Nerves? What nerves - it\u2019s an opening day win, and Australia roll on! Final quarter - 9\u2019 gone: In a group that could be tight, points difference may yet play a vital role, and this is blowing out for the Canadians. It\u2019s a harsh scoreline, especially considering how well they played in that epic 37-point third quarter. It\u2019s been a final quarter mauling from the Boomers though - 28-6 the scoring run; a huge statement. Final quarter - 7\u2019 gone: Another Canadian time out as Australia pull 16 points clear. Dellavedova the point leader with 21, but there are five Australians with 10+ points. Ingles the conductor though, with a remarkable 9 score assists. Meanwhile, they look dead on their feet, Canada. It was a huge third quarter effort, and maybe it\u2019s cost them. Final quarter - 6\u2019 gone: Pangos is back on and he\u2019s weaving - and Bogut fouls the Canadian playmaker. Delly and Ingles miss consecutive threes and there\u2019s just the slightest sniff of a chance for Canada, but they miss their chance, and Ingles feed Kay for an easy layup. Mills misses a three - hasn\u2019t been the impact you\u2019d expect from Patty today, perhaps - and both side squander chances. Ten the difference. Final quarter - 4\u2019 gone: It\u2019s another time out for Canada. Where did their lead go?? It\u2019s a 16-2 start from the Boomers in the final quarter. Ooph. That\u2019s incredible. Another 3-pointer from Delly, Bogut chimes in with two more. Cometh the hour, cometh the old heads. Final quarter - 4\u2019 gone: Delly with another three, but it\u2019s Joe Ingles who\u2019s starting to dictate the play out there. Forget Karl Marx, we\u2019ve got Ingles, and Australia break out to an eight-point-lead. Boom Boom Boomers! Final quarter - 3\u2019 gone: Chris Goulding with a crucial start to the quarter, Australia first on the board. Klassen with an open 3-point attempt for Canada but he misses badly, and Aron Baynes heads up the other end and throws down a huge dunk! It\u2019s an 8-0 unanswered streak for the Boomers - just what the (Australian basketball) doctor ordered! Some soothing music for nervous Boomers fans - as brother Phillip and Thomas Scrub are running wild for Canada. Hand me my TLC. Three-quarter-time: Australia 76-77 Canada A great turnover from Dellavedova who goes to the basket, and draws the foul in the process. A move right from the \u201cexperience\u201d playbook. Ingles almost pulls off a huge intercept, but Canada continue and score. Kay then misses with the two, and the North Americans go to the line after a foul. Delly with a huge three, but Thomas Scrub hits straight back! An incredible 37-point quarter for Canada. We. Have. A. Game. On. 3rd quarter - 8\u2019 gone: Goulding with a big 3-pointer, before Mills almost landed a rapid-fire second, the ball rolls agonisingly around the ring before falling out! He goes to the stripe anyway for a foul and lands them. And we\u2019re within a point here again. 3rd quarter - 6\u2019 gone: This is actual madness! Canada have gone on an incredible 25-7 run, and Australia have gone to another time out. They\u2019ve picked up 22 points from turnovers, the North Americans. The Boomers are literally throwing this game away! What can coach Lemanis urge from his shufflers. 3rd quarter - 4\u2019 gone: Deary me - we\u2019re scores locked! And now Canada are ahead by 3! It\u2019s a huge 5-pt run after an \u201cunsportsmanlike foul\u201d. And it\u2019s Kevin Pangos running the show for the North Americans, who lands a big 3-pointer from the pocket. What was in that half-time team talk?! Australia need their experienced players to really stand up here; this has been a horrible few minutes for the Boomers. 3rd quarter - 2\u2019 gone: Okay, we\u2019re back live - and it\u2019s a blistering start to the second half for the world No 23 side: who race to a 9-0 start! Back-to-back turnovers allows the North Americans to bag consecutive baskets, before a huge 3-pointer prompts an Australia time out. Two points the margin - this has got very lively, very quickly. Some background info on the Basketball World Cup (if that\u2019s flown under your radar). There\u2019s a lot of hype about Australia being a real potential champion, and they did of course roll Team USA in a recent friendly downunder, but both USA and Australia do go to the World Cup with diminished rosters (most notably no Ben Simmons or Thon Maker, with Dante Exum also out through injury). Despite that they\u2019re only ranked 11th in the world, Australia. A reflection perhaps more on the limited amount of international basketball the Boomers are playing. 32 teams in 8 groups of four with top two advancing - a loss isn\u2019t curtains therefore, but with Lithuania also in the group Australia would be keen to start their Group H campaign with a win. It was threatening to blow open just before the major break, but they\u2019ve done well to nibble back into the deficit, have Canada. A huge pressure 3-pointer before an offensive foul from Joe Ingles allowed the North Americans to grab a few more in a great final minute. Australia are shooting well (66% from the field) and working the boards brilliantly - leading the rebounds 20-10 - but there\u2019s still been plenty of needless turnovers from the Boomers. Not a foregone conclusion here, but Canada will need to lift to cause a boilover. They\u2019ve finished like a team that knows their season has been salvaged, Wests! A meek capitulation from the Dragons who have endured another season to forget. But we\u2019re set for a cracking round 25 winner-takes-all clash between the Tigers and the Sharks. Get your tickets quick, because that one\u2019s going to sell out like hotcakes. Too much class, too much desire. A great showing from the Tigers. Basketball - second quarter: It\u2019s a bright start for Canada, as they cut the deficit straight back to five. But then a clean 3-pointer from Dellavedova gets the Boomers flying again. It\u2019s been a high-scoring match so far - both offences making the most of their opportunities, but the foul count continues to rise for the North Americans. Their coach is sent to the bench for a technical - some frustration with the calls, but the margin continues to hover around the 10-point mark. NRL - 76 min: Try! Dragons 14-36 Tigers (Brooks) It\u2019s party time - the Tigers know that they\u2019re alive, and it\u2019s another long-ranger! How\u2019s the pace from Brooks - no catching him from there! Get ready, Sharks. We\u2019re coming for your 8th spot! Basketball - quarter-time: Australia 29-20 Canada A terrific end to the quarter for Australia. They\u2019d shuffled their pack, Canada after that stoppage and cut the lead back to just a couple. But indiscipline sent Australia to the stripe before Joe Ingles\u2019 match awareness ran down the quarter clock perfectly and Chris Goulding fired home a perfect 3-pointer right on the buzzer. Big morale boost! NRL - 69 min: Try! Dragons 14-30 Tigers (Marshall) And if anyone deserved a try today, who else - it\u2019s the evergreen Benji Marshall! 34-years-young and still running the show. He gets the head up, stares at the line and backs himself. And don\u2019t his teammates love that! Surely that\u2019s the game. Basketball: World Cup underway! As exciting as the NRL is, we have of course just bounced off in the first game of the Basketball World Cup, where it\u2019s Australia v Canada. We\u2019re seven minutes in and they\u2019ve called for the first time out of the game, Canada as they trail by 15-9. The big news for Bogut-injury-watchers. The big man has been cleared of that suspected ankle issue and is playing; and playing well. Here\u2019s the five that started the game for Australia, FYI: 61 min: No try! Tom Mikaele burrows over the line, and big hit and spin under attention from Graham and Frizzell, but he doesn\u2019t ground! Desperate defence from the Origin man, Frizzell, who prevents the clean grounding. They almost thought they\u2019d closed it then, the Tigers. Still, handy 10 point lead remains. NRL - 58 min: Try! Dragons 14-24 Tigers (Momirovski) It was coming, the dam walls were shaking, and it was a terrific ball from Marshall onto the chest of the man of the moment, Momirovski, who still had to get through a pack of defenders. Great feet, great determination and he\u2019s added two more from the boot. 20 points for the game! 57 min: They\u2019re knocking at the door, the Tigers. A big defensive set of six from the Dragons with Marshall and friends probing. They hold out, but as they look to dive on a loose ball there\u2019s a knock on, and Wests get six again! Can they turn pressure to points? 53 min: Ach! Nasty double injury. Zac Lomax is down and there\u2019s huge concern. He\u2019s slipped into a tackle from Thompson who collects his opponent with his knees, and the replay suggests a very hard head knock from Esan Masters in the process. Nothing dirty, just an honest accident as Lomax fell into contact. Masters also down, not sure what\u2019s wrong. Lomax leaves the field, walking at least. But we won\u2019t see him again, he\u2019s badly concussed. NRL - 47 min: Try! Dragons 14-18 Tigers (Widdop) Golly gosh. It\u2019s a harrowing mistake at the back - poor Madge is now sitting on an ants nest again. It\u2019s a straight-forward bomb from Hunt, but the fullback Corey Thompson has had a \u2018mare. It\u2019s popped straight off his chest - he\u2019s dropped it cold - and it couldn\u2019t have rolled more favourably for Widdop who scores easily. And converts his try. NRL - 45 min: Try! Dragons 8-18 Tigers (Momirovski) My, my! They force the play wide, Widdop looks to pick out his winger, but it\u2019s the flying centre who comes in, reads the play, takes the intercept and sprints 90m to the line! Huge play - could that be the game? He converts his own try, well done Momirovski - Madge issues a small sigh of relief up in the Tigers\u2019 box. NRL - second half! Dragons 8-12 Tigers We\u2019re back underway, a few minutes in, and it\u2019s a terrific carry from Luciano Leilua. He\u2019s caught high and now the Dragons can set something up with the resulting set of six. What can they muster? So, in case you\u2019d forgotten (and I\u2019m sure Cronulla/Wests fans absolutely hadn\u2019t) there is of course one round left - and with Panthers missing out yesterday, should the Tigers win today there will be two teams in contention for 8th and final post-season spot: the Sharks, and the Tigers. And who do they play next week? Each other. Hello, bonus instant-death finals week! NRL - half-time: Dragons 8-12 Tigers So they keep their noses ahead, and their finals hopes still hanging by a thread. Will they tighten up, the Tigers? Or will the Dragons roll over? Big forty to come. They\u2019ll be watching nervously in Cronulla, hoping not to cop a double whammy of heartbreaking loss followed by a win to their top-eight rivals. 37 min: Scrum won against the feed! Tell your kids about it. I don\u2019t think I can remember the last time a scrum was meaningful in league. Extraordinary scenes. They don\u2019t make it count, the Dragons. They were only 20-25m out, but the Tigers hold firm. Widdop\u2019s last tackle dash to the blind side was repelled, so they look to close the half in front. NRL - 30 min: Try! Dragons 8-12 Tigers (Garner) Eep, and after all that pressure, we\u2019re up the other end with a try to the Tigers. Often the way, no? Brooks with a clever grubber and it\u2019s Garner who wins the footrace, Aitken claiming he was impeded but contact seemed minimal. Momirovski adds the extras. 28 min: Ooh! So close for James Graham! He looked to have grounded after a terrific kick chase, but it\u2019s just gone dead. Of all the people on the pitch it was the veteran forward - he was just inches away! No luck for the Dragons, and they\u2019re hit with a 7-tackle turnaround. On such fine margins etc. NRL - 25 min: Dragons 8-6 Tigers Its a penalty, duly dispatched from Widdop. They almost had more, the Dragons but again after a tech-conference it was confirmed that there was no grounding from St George. Remarkable. NRL - 20 min: Dragons 6-6 Tigers (Aitken) Oh my. A bit of an error at the back from the experienced Robert Jennings; he had the chance to ground in goal, but he tried to scoop the ball clear, but only enabled Aitken to steal in and score! Great hands by Hunt in the build up - that was a rotten pass out of dummy half, but he kept the move flowing. Game on! NRL - 15 min: Dragons 0-6 Tigers (Momirovski) It took about three minutes for the Tigers to breach the Dragons\u2019 line - lets hope heads don\u2019t drop, they are of course on a pretty bad losing streak despite their early season confidence, St George. They\u2019ve gone very close through Widdop, but the Bunker cast a close eye over proceedings and awarded a 10m scrum. Still, on the attack. Hi all! What a frenetic end at Shark Park! A spot in the top four, a place in the top eight - plenty on the line and a heartbreaking end for the Sharks. Not quite a game that stops the nation, but no doubt the PM will be devastated, so effectively? As JP said, we\u2019ve got live NRL action in the Tigers-Dragons clash so I\u2019ll jump right into this. That late result of course does have a bearing on this one - it means the Tigers\u2019 season remains alive if they can win here. Which I guess is better than liveblogging a dead rubber? Ok, without further ado it\u2019s time to handover to Richard Parkin. He\u2019ll take you through the Boomers\u2019 opening World Cup fixture against Canada later on, but first it\u2019s over to the SCG where there\u2019s already a try in the Dragons v Tigers clash. Finally, finally, finally, from the following set Sezer does kick a golden point. What a game! NRL: 88 mins: Sharks 14-14 Raiders - What on earth are Canberra doing? For the second time in a matter of minutes they had a field goal option on a platter but decide to run down the set and then grubber for a try. Again it fails and the match continues. The Raiders are butchering this. NRL: While the Sharks and Raiders continue to do battle in the Shire, the Tigers and Dragons are underway at the SCG. Plenty could change at the bottom end of the eight over the next hour or so. NRL: 85 mins: Sharks 14-14 Raiders - We go to a second period of golden point with neither side able to score in the first five-minute period. Canberra were best placed but went all-or-nothing for a try in the left corner instead of establishing a solid base from which to drop a goal after consecutive offloads saw then within sight of points after four tackles. NRL: FT: Sharks 14-14 Raiders - Neither side could convert on their final possessions. The Raiders came closest, stripping the Sharks just inside their own half with seconds left on the clock but the desperate long range field goal fell well short. To golden point we go. NRL: 78 mins: Sharks 14-14 Raiders - Now Sezer has a brace of drop goals and we\u2019re back level with a set each remaining in normal time. NRL: 77 mins: Sharks 14-13 Raiders - And from the second of those sets Townsend kicks his second field goal to put the home side back in front. NRL: 76 mins: Sharks 13-13 Raiders - We\u2019re still heading to golden point but it\u2019s all Sharks in these closing stages. The Raiders have butchered their last couple of sets, handing Cronulla consecutive seven tackle drives. NRL: 70 mins: Sharks 13-13 Raiders - Can the Sharks hit back? Yes, says Chad Townsend, dropping a goal of his own to level the scores with ten minutes left to play. NRL: 67 mins: Sharks 12-13 Raiders - Canberra hit the front with 13 minutes remaining, Aidan Sezer accepting the drop-goal. Can the Sharks hit back? NRL: 60 mins: Sharks 12-12 Raiders - It\u2019s a game of two halves at Shark Park and the Raiders are right back in it with their second try of the second term. NRL: 50 mins: Sharks 12-6 Raiders - The visitors are not out of this one just yet. NRL: 45 mins: Sharks 12-0 Raiders - The second half is underway at Shark Park but the home side are now without Josh Dugan, who failed at HIA. That comes after Shaun Johnson injured himself during the prematch warm-up. Tennis: Nick Kyrgios has bowed out of the US Open at the third round, falling to Russian Andrey Rublev. NRL: HT: Sharks 12-0 Raiders - It\u2019s all going according to plan for Paul Gallen on his farewell to Shark Park. Cronulla lead by three tries to nothing at the break with Ronaldo Mulitalo and Jayden Brailey both crossing early on, Mulitalo then diving over for a brace shortly before the siren. It\u2019s been a tight, forward dominated contest with the Raiders unable to pierce a disciplined home defence. The Melbourne Vixens will travel to the NSW Swifts next weekend for the Super Netball preliminary final after demolishing their crosstown rivals the Collingwood Magpies in their minor semi-final. Stung by their reverse to the Magpies last week the Vixens flew out of the blocks, defending with intent and attacking at speed, blowing their opponents off court. As the game wore on Melbourne oozed confidence while the frustration was evident on the faces of the Collingwood players. Tegan Philip and Caitlin Thwaites dovetailed superbly in attack, Kate Moloney delivered a captain\u2019s performance at centre, while Emily Mannix shone in defence. For the Magpies Shimona Nelson ended with a game-high 42 goals but the difficulty finding her in the opening exchanges led to the early deficit that could never be clawed back. Nat Medhurst, so dominant last week was peripheral. Super Netball: Q4: 10 mins remaining - Vixens 53-38 Magpies - The Magpies are refusing to give up but the Vixens are just too focussed and ultimately too good. The movement of Philip and Thwaites in attack is driving the Magpies defence to distraction. NRL: 17 mins gone: Sharks 8-0 Raiders - And it\u2019s turning into a perfect send off for Gallen with Cronulla crossing twice in the opening 20 minutes. At this rate the Sharks are on course to end the round seventh and into the finals. NRL: The Shark Park patrons are sharing their love for retiring skipper Paul Gallen. Super Netball: 3QT - Vixens 46-33 Magpies - The Magpies dug deep in the third quarter but they could still barely lay a glove on the dominant Vixens. Super Netball: Q3: 11 mins remaining - Vixens 39-22 Magpies - The Vixens do not look like dropping their intensity at the start of the second half and it\u2019s showing in the Magpies\u2019 attack which is looking increasingly disjointed. NRL: We\u2019re underway at Shark Park in the opening NRL contest of the day. Cronulla can all-but guarantee their finals place with a win at home to Canberra but the Raiders will start favourites as they push to finish as high as possible in the top four. To add to the significance of the occasion, this will be Paul Gallen\u2019s final home fixture for the Sharks. Super Netball: HT: Vixens 34-19 Magpies - Stunning from the Melbourne Vixens who are surging towards a preliminary final date with the Swifts. They resisted an early second-quarter fightback from the Magpies, stuck to their processes and the longer the period wore on the more the frustration told in their opponents. It would take an extraordinary turnaround from here. The difference between this week and last? Nat Medhurst dominated seven days ago, ending with 25 feeds. The Vixens have placed her under much closer scrutiny this time around and she has just four to her name to half-time. Super Netball: Q2: 5 mins remaining: Vixens 29-19 Magpies - This second quarter is much more even than the first but the Vixens are matching everything the Magpies can throw at them, piecing their way through the visiting defence with precision. Nat Medhurst has started slowly but the superstar is growing into the battle. Super Netball: Q2: 10 mins remaining: Vixens 25-14 Magpies - Better from the Magpies to start the second quarter, in particular the feeding through to Nelson in the circle. Geva Mentor is also growing into the contest at the other end of the court. Super Netball: QT: Vixens 20-9 Magpies - What an opening quarter by the Vixens. Stunned early on by the Magpies last week they have come flying out of the blocks in the semi-final to take a commanding lead. Focussed in defence and slick in possession the Vixens are oozing confidence and look set for a preliminary final appearance. Super Netball: Q1: 5 mins remaining: Vixens 14-7 Magpies - Collingwood have stabilised since their time out, finding Nelson with greater ease. They\u2019re still playing catch-up though and the Vixens are playing with serious intensity. Super Netball: Q1: 9 mins remaining: Vixens 7-2 Magpies - Time out called by the Magpies in a bid to stem the bleeding. The Vixens are hungrier and more aggressive in these opening exchanges with Emily Mannix in particular dominating her head-to-head with Shimona Nelson. Super Netball: Q1: 11 mins remaining: Vixens 4-2 Magpies - It\u2019s a much more even start this week than last with the Vixens much more physical in defence. The atmosphere in the State Netball Centre is outstanding. Motorsport: Before we concentrate on the Super Netball, some sad news to report with the FIA announcing driver Anthoine Hubert has died after a major accident during the Formula 2 feature race at the Belgian Grand Prix. The race was cancelled after the crash on the second lap at Spa-Francorchamps. In the high-speed incident involving Hubert and Juan Manuel Correa both cars took major damage but Hubert\u2019s almost disintegrated. Hubert is the first driver to die as a result of an accident at an F1 event since Jules Bianchi succumbed to the injuries he sustained in Japan in 2014. Super Netball: Here are your line-ups. All the pressure on the Vixens after they were blitzed by the Magpies last weekend. Hello everybody and welcome to a lean Sunday Sportwatch as fixtures across some of Australia\u2019s biggest competitions decrease in number but increase in significance. We begin today with the second Super Netball semi-final between the Vixens and Magpies. That gets underway just after 1pm with the winner travelling to NSW next weekend to battle the Swifts for the right to take on the Lightning in the grand final. Then we\u2019re all about the NRL with a pair of fixtures with finals implications. From 2pm the Sharks dare not slip up against the Raiders while from 4pm it\u2019s all about the Tigers who face a must-win 80-minutes away to the Dragons. Finally, from 5.30pm we turn our attention to basketball and the opening match of Australia\u2019s men\u2019s world cup campaign against Canada. In amongst all that we\u2019ll have updates from Flushing Meadows with Australians prominent in the US Open, there\u2019s Ashes to discuss, and plenty more besides on a busy weekend of sport around the world.

      "bodyText": "Rebellious former cabinet ministers will have a showdown meeting with Boris Johnson on Monday, as the former justice secretary David Gauke said he believed the national interest would come first if he faced deselection for opposing a no-deal Brexit. Gauke, one of several ministers who resigned from the cabinet after Johnson became prime minister, is among a number of ex-cabinet ministers who will back moves in parliament next week to legislate against no deal. A cross-party alliance of MPs opposed to no deal are expected to begin moves on Tuesday to table a bill mandating Johnson to ask the EU for a further extension to the UK\u2019s membership, which they hope to complete including passage through the House of Lords by the beginning of next week before parliament is prorogued. Gauke said he hoped Johnson would not follow through with reported threats that any Conservative MP who voted against the government next week would face deselection at the next election. \u201cSometimes there is a point where ... you have to judge between your own personal interests and the national interest.

However, on Sunday the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, again insisted he would not scrap the Irish backstop or amend the withdrawal agreement. Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, Barnier said: \u201cI am not optimistic about avoiding a no-deal scenario, but we should all continue to work with determination. \u201cOn the EU side, we had intense discussions with EU member states on the need to guarantee the integrity of the EU\u2019s single market, while keeping that border fully open. In this sense, the backstop is the maximum amount of flexibility that the EU can offer to a non-member state.\u201d",

Our modest-sized hotel room in Matera, southern Italy, once housed an entire family \u2013 not back in the middle ages, but within living memory. Matera, a troglodyte city in Basilicata, was considered \u201cthe shame of Italy\u201d in the 1950s because of the extreme poverty and widespread disease in its ancient Sassi districts. The residents were compulsorily relocated and the crumbling city, thought to be possibly the third-oldest in the world after Aleppo and Jericho, lay empty for the first time in 10,000 years.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/may/19/holiday-guide-basilicata-italy-best-hotels-restaurants\">Holiday guide to Basilicata, Italy: what to see plus the best restaurants and hotels</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Yet today it is full of tourists keen to visit one of the two 2019 European capitals of culture (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2019/jul/29/locals-guide-to-plovdiv-bulgaria-10-top-tips-capital-of-culture\">the other is Plovdiv, Bulgaria</a>). Investment began trickling in from the late 1980s, and although the families that had been forced out never returned, many of their descendants came back to open hotels and restaurants. Matera got a boost when it became a world heritage site in 1993, and another when it starred as Jerusalem in Mel Gibson\u2019s controversial <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/mar/26/dvdreviews.shopping2\" title=\"\">The Passion of the Christ</a></em> in 2004. In fact, filmmakers can\u2019t resist it \u2013 the 25th Bond movie <em>No Time To Die</em> (released next year) is the latest blockbuster to be filmed here.</p> \n<p>I was visiting on a new <a href=\"https://www.inntravel.co.uk/cycling-holidays/italy/the-south/puglia-basilicata\" title=\"\">Sassi and Trulli</a><a href=\"https://www.inntravel.co.uk/cycling-holidays/italy/the-south/puglia-basilicata\" title=\"\"> short break</a> with Inntravel to find out what makes Matera so special. It didn\u2019t take long to work out \u2013 this city is like nowhere else on Earth. The two Sassi (\u201cstones\u201d) districts, Sasso Caveoso and Sasso Barisano, are built on natural caves that have been excavated and extended over millennia. A warren of pale limestone churches, monasteries, palaces and houses rises above the caves, all balanced on the edge of a ravine. By day, it is breathtaking; lit up at dusk, it can bring you to tears.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a7d64f64f85f038d3223289a44c553a0c75b5bc2\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a7d64f64f85f038d3223289a44c553a0c75b5bc2/0_147_7952_4771/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Inside story: a home carved out of stone.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Inside story \u2026 a home carved out of stone.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>One of Matera\u2019s unmissable sights is its <em>chies</em><em>e rupestri</em> or rock churches. As well as those in the city, there are another 150 in the <a href=\"https://www.infosassitour.com/item/park-of-the-rock-churches/\" title=\"\">Park of the Rock Churches</a> across the Gravina river, which can be reached on a guided tour or by bike (our trip included bike hire). The 12th-century <a href=\"https://www.oltrelartematera.it/en/rupestrian-churches/san-pietro-barisano/\" title=\"\">Chiesa San Pietro Barisano</a> is the biggest in the Sassi, its interiors completely carved out of the rock. My macabre partner perched in one of the sinister \u201cdraining chairs\u201d in the crypt, where dead priests were once seated until their flesh had decomposed. Other standout rock churches include <a href=\"https://www.oltrelartematera.it/en/rupestrian-churches/santa-maria-de-idris/\" title=\"\">Santa Maria de Idris</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.sassiweb.it/matera-podcast/sasso-caveoso/convicinio-sant-antonio/\" title=\"\">Convicinio di Sant\u2019Antonio</a>, which sit in a spectacular spot on a rocky spur.

Restaurants showcase Basilicatan specialities, often called Lucanian cuisine after the region\u2019s ancient name. Grains, pulses and vegetables dominate this <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/nov/17/rachel-roddy-beens-greens-italian-roman-stew-recipe\" title=\"\">cucina povera</a></em>, with small amounts of meat and cheese. <a href=\"http://www.lafocagna.com/\" title=\"\">La Focagna</a>, a cosy cave tavern that stays open until 2am, serves simple, affordable dishes. We ate <em>crapiata,</em> a delicious bean soup served with toasted Matera bread, followed by orecchiette with garlicky <em>cime di rapa</em> (a leafy brassica). More upmarket cave restaurants can be found on and around Via Bruno Buozzi, such as the one we chose, <a href=\"http://www.morganristorante.it/\" title=\"\">Morgan</a>. A selection of starters included mashed fava beans with chicory, and was followed by pappardelle with wild boar sauce.

The city\u2019s main square is Piazza Vittorio Veneto in the 17th-century \u201cnew\u201d town. It is the key spot for a <em>passeggiata</em>, and has incredible views over the Sassi skyline. Later in the evening, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/mosto.osteriadellabirra/\" title=\"\">Mosto Osteria Della Birra</a> is a lively bar for a beer or an <em>amaro lucano</em>, the local digestif. The hippest hangout is <a href=\"https://www.area8.it/en/home-en/\" title=\"\">Area 8</a>, a cocktail bar with film screenings and live music.</p> \n<p>Like the restaurants and bars, Matera\u2019s hotels make the most of their unique architecture. We stayed in a simple cave room in <a href=\"http://www.locandadisanmartino.it/en/home/\" title=\"\">Locanda di San Martino</a>, a terraced 40-room hotel in the heart of the Sassi. The thermal baths beneath the hotel, in passages and cisterns carved out of the rock thousands of years ago, are sensational. We also spent a night in <a href=\"http://www.palazzodegliabati.it/en/\" title=\"\">Palazzo degli Abati</a>, which has two rooms in caves and three in an 18th-century palace. Our room had two million-year-old fossils in the walls.</p> \n<p>There may be something a little uncomfortable about tourists thronging to eat and sleep in peasant dwellings. After all, the previous occupants lived in caves and huts out of necessity.

      "bodyText": "\u2018This room is called Senza Nidd \u2013 without anything \u2013 because the people who lived here were so poor,\u201d said the receptionist. Our modest-sized hotel room in Matera, southern Italy, once housed an entire family \u2013 not back in the middle ages, but within living memory. Matera, a troglodyte city in Basilicata, was considered \u201cthe shame of Italy\u201d in the 1950s because of the extreme poverty and widespread disease in its ancient Sassi districts. The residents were compulsorily relocated and the crumbling city, thought to be possibly the third-oldest in the world after Aleppo and Jericho, lay empty for the first time in 10,000 years. Yet today it is full of tourists keen to visit one of the two 2019 European capitals of culture (the other is Plovdiv, Bulgaria). Investment began trickling in from the late 1980s, and although the families that had been forced out never returned, many of their descendants came back to open hotels and restaurants. Matera got a boost when it became a world heritage site in 1993, and another when it starred as Jerusalem in Mel Gibson\u2019s controversial The Passion of the Christ in 2004. In fact, filmmakers can\u2019t resist it \u2013 the 25th Bond movie No Time To Die (released next year) is the latest blockbuster to be filmed here. I was visiting on a new Sassi and Trulli short break with Inntravel to find out what makes Matera so special. It didn\u2019t take long to work out \u2013 this city is like nowhere else on Earth. The two Sassi (\u201cstones\u201d) districts, Sasso Caveoso and Sasso Barisano, are built on natural caves that have been excavated and extended over millennia. A warren of pale limestone churches, monasteries, palaces and houses rises above the caves, all balanced on the edge of a ravine. By day, it is breathtaking; lit up at dusk, it can bring you to tears. One of Matera\u2019s unmissable sights is its chiese rupestri or rock churches. As well as those in the city, there are another 150 in the Park of the Rock Churches across the Gravina river, which can be reached on a guided tour or by bike (our trip included bike hire). The 12th-century Chiesa San Pietro Barisano is the biggest in the Sassi, its interiors completely carved out of the rock. My macabre partner perched in one of the sinister \u201cdraining chairs\u201d in the crypt, where dead priests were once seated until their flesh had decomposed. Other standout rock churches include Santa Maria de Idris and the Convicinio di Sant\u2019Antonio, which sit in a spectacular spot on a rocky spur. The 13th-century cathedral rises above the Sassi, reached via a steep tangle of alleyways. Another top sight is the Palombaro Lungo, a huge manmade water cistern dug into the rock during the 16th century. Its scale and ingenuity are certainly impressive, but it lacks the grandeur of, say, the Basilica Cistern in Istanbul. We found a visit to a casa grotta more compelling \u2013 a handful of cave houses have been preserved as museums, complete with fixtures, fittings and model livestock. We visited Casa Grotta del Barisano, where a family of seven, plus farm animals, lived without electricity or running water until 1960. As befitting a capital of culture, Matera has several rewarding museums, including the Archaeological Museum, with a collection of 4th- and 5th-century Greek vases, and the Museum of Medieval and Modern Art, which includes work by Carlo Levi, whose 1945 book Christ Stopped at Eboli first alerted the world to the living conditions in this part of southern Italy. Our highlight was Musma, the Museum of Contemporary Sculpture, where cutting-edge sculpture is housed in centuries-old caves below and a 16th-century palace above. For this year of culture, the city\u2019s artistic venues are hosting extra exhibitions, concerts and workshops, outdoor performances and guided walks. Five giant bronze Salvador Dal\u00ed reproductions are dotted around town, including a melting clock; they accompany a Dal\u00ed exhibition at the frescoed Chiesa di Madonna delle Virt\u00f9 and Chiesa di San Nicola dei Greci. Matera has a rich culinary tradition. Restaurants showcase Basilicatan specialities, often called Lucanian cuisine after the region\u2019s ancient name. Grains, pulses and vegetables dominate this cucina povera, with small amounts of meat and cheese. La Focagna, a cosy cave tavern that stays open until 2am, serves simple, affordable dishes. We ate crapiata, a delicious bean soup served with toasted Matera bread, followed by orecchiette with garlicky cime di rapa (a leafy brassica). More upmarket cave restaurants can be found on and around Via Bruno Buozzi, such as the one we chose, Morgan. A selection of starters included mashed fava beans with chicory, and was followed by pappardelle with wild boar sauce. We ordered peperoni cruschi on the side \u2013 these sun-dried red peppers from Senise are highly prized \u2013 and drank aglianico, Basilicata\u2019s star grape. Caf\u00e9-thronged Piazza del Sedile was our favourite place for an afternoon pitstop; I Due Sassi Caf\u00e9 does a mean Campari spritz. The city\u2019s main square is Piazza Vittorio Veneto in the 17th-century \u201cnew\u201d town. It is the key spot for a passeggiata, and has incredible views over the Sassi skyline. Later in the evening, Mosto Osteria Della Birra is a lively bar for a beer or an amaro lucano, the local digestif. The hippest hangout is Area 8, a cocktail bar with film screenings and live music. Like the restaurants and bars, Matera\u2019s hotels make the most of their unique architecture. We stayed in a simple cave room in Locanda di San Martino, a terraced 40-room hotel in the heart of the Sassi. The thermal baths beneath the hotel, in passages and cisterns carved out of the rock thousands of years ago, are sensational. We also spent a night in Palazzo degli Abati, which has two rooms in caves and three in an 18th-century palace. Our room had two million-year-old fossils in the walls. There may be something a little uncomfortable about tourists thronging to eat and sleep in peasant dwellings. After all, the previous occupants lived in caves and huts out of necessity. On the other hand, it is one way to preserve a piece of history \u2013 as well as the memory of the Senza Nidd family, and thousands like them. Way to go The trip was provided by Inntravel, which has a Sassi and Trulli self-guided hotel-to-hotel cycling short break from \u00a3695pp, including four nights\u2019 B&amp;B accommodation, two dinners, cycle hire, route notes and maps, luggage transported between hotels and return taxi from/to Bari airport. Ebikes are available at a supplement of \u00a350pp. Available 25 August to 31 October and 1 April to 30 June Looking for a holiday with a difference?

The conversation soon turned to the bizarre incident in the final over of normal time, when Martin Guptill\u2019s throw hit Ben Stokes\u2019s bat and raced to the boundary. \u201cThat,\u201d whispered Buttler, \u201cwas the first thing he middled all day.\u201d</p> <p>Buttler\u2019s comment was playful and affectionate, yet there was a bit of truth in it. For almost all of that innings, Stokes was frustrated by his inability to time the ball on a difficult pitch. He hit three fours in his first 85 balls, before the situation demanded that he go nuclear. Stokes has oodles of skill, especially with the bat. He is one of the few batsmen who can play every shot in the 20th- and 21st-century batting textbooks. But his true superpower, the thing that has enabled his twin miracles this summer, is his will. He belongs to that rare group of all-action sporting heroes who believe they can climb Everest with a hangover, or save the Ashes by scoring more in a last-wicket partnership than the whole team managed in the first innings.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/27/troubled-ben-stokes-summer-ashes-headingley-hero-england\">Once troubled Ben Stokes now has a summer he will always own | Andy Bull</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Stokes did not just <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/27/troubled-ben-stokes-summer-ashes-headingley-hero-england\" title=\"\">bring England back from the dead last Sunday</a>; he brought them back from a cremation. It was an astonishing achievement, euphoric confirmation of his greatness. The relative modesty of Stokes\u2019s numbers in Test cricket \u2013 he averages 36 with the bat, 32 with the ball \u2013 are sometimes used in evidence against him. But trying to assess his impact through statistics is like trying to quantify love. It should surprise nobody if Stokes gets a pair at Old Trafford. He has always had wild fluctuations in form and has been fighting self\u2011doubt ever since, at the age of 14, he puked through nerves before his debut for Cumbria.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to go through a period of low scores and not got too well,\u201d said Stokes three years ago in his book, <em>Firestarter</em>. \u201cBut all of a sudden I know something can just happen for me. I\u2019m not necessarily a form player, more of an in-the-moment player.\u201d</p> <p>For such a great player, he can be a bit of a klutz. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/03/west-indies-win-world-t20-final-carlos-brathwaite-sinks-england\" title=\"\">Carlos Brathwaite\u2019s four sixes in the World T20 final </a>will always be part of his story, and his career has been studded with absurd, absent-minded run-outs.</p> <p>Even at Headingley, he played a hideous shot in the first innings and ran out Buttler in the second. His never-ending bowling spell was partly a penance for that poor stroke. Technically, it was two spells, but in reality it was one, as Stokes had three balls off before returning to the attack when Jofra Archer was injured. In all he bowled 24.2 overs. Analysis from <a href=\"http://cricviz.com/\" title=\"\">CricViz</a>, who hold the largest database in cricket, show it is the longest spell by a pace bowler in international cricket since 2006.</p> <p>Stokes\u2019s self-flagellation increased his determination to ensure England would not lose the Ashes, not on his watch. Stokes is allergic to defeat; that, even more than the pursuit of glory, drives him. It was telling that, off the final ball of the World Cup final, when England needed two to win and one to tie, Stokes\u2019s sole thought was to bunt the ball into a gap so that he would get at least one run and ensure England would live to fight another over.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In the biggest moments, Stokes cannot hide his emotions or fatigue. He should have a tattoo of a heart on his sleeve</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Stokes had some crazy moments of fortune at Lord\u2019s. Whether you make your own luck is debatable but Stokes certainly gives himself the opportunity to get lucky by keeping England in games that would otherwise have been long lost. The Brathwaite experience taught him that if you take a game deep enough, the strangest things can happen. Stokes also knows that, at moments of the highest pressure, something stirs in him: desperation, defiance, a heightened instinct, a bit of genius, and, most of all, an elemental force of personality.</p> <p>The greater the stakes, the more Stokes wants \u2013 needs \u2013 to be involved, which is why his career will always lurch between extremes of success and failure. He is a beacon of moral courage. As a bowler he is selectively used but it is indicative that he took the last wickets when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/oct/24/bangladesh-england-first-test-day-five-live-cricket\" title=\"\">England beat Bangladesh by 22 runs in 2016</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/aug/04/england-beat-india-first-test-match-report-ben-stokes-virat-kohli\" title=\"\">India by 31 runs at Edgbaston in 2018</a>.</p> <p>When the mood takes him, or the situation demands, he will bowl forever. CricViz data shows that in his Test career he has bowled 12 spells of 10 overs or more. The sight of Stokes demonstrably knackered, either while batting or bowling, has become common.</p> <p>In the biggest moments, Stokes cannot hide his fatigue or his emotions \u2013 he could not watch when Jack Leach was batting last Sunday and he was one of the few England players who cried on the field after the World Cup final. He should have a tattoo of a heart on his sleeve.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/26/ben-stokes-hundred-greatest-test-innings\">The big question: was Stokes\u2019s hundred the greatest Test innings you\u2019ve seen?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A big part of Stokes\u2019s appeal is that, in an era of media\u2011training and image-consciousness, he is authentic, sometimes to a fault. He looks like a fan who has been placed in the body of Ben Stokes for the day. Many great players enjoy their work; Stokes usually looks almost comically careworn. The enjoyment comes after the event, with a primal roar after he blasts the winning runs \u2013 just imagine how alive he felt at that moment at Headingley \u2013 and then behind closed doors with his mates.</p> <p>Despite all the emotion, Stokes played with startling clarity in both innings. While most spectators, never mind the players, were unable to think straight, Stokes had a precise gameplan each time. He is like a reverse swan \u2013 paddling furiously on the surface, serene under water. In that sense, Stokes is the ideal hero for these melodramatic times. In others, not so much. A judgmental minority, apparently born without the empathy gene, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/aug/14/ben-stokes-trial-cleared-affray-brawl-outside-bristol-nightclub-england-cricketer\" title=\"\">will never forgive or let him forget Bristol</a>, and he is understandably tired of being asked about it. Yet he might reflect that it was a blessing in an extremely good disguise, one that was humbling rather than humiliating.</p> <p>While the year-long fallout was an experience Stokes probably would not wish on Marlon Samuels, it has accelerated his maturity and changed him almost exclusively for the better. He is much less confrontational, without any obvious impact on his ferocious competitiveness, and has become even more selfless.</p> <p>Stokes was always an exemplary team man but now his commitment to the collective verges on the obsessive. \u201cEverything he does is for the team,\u201d said Stuart Broad last Sunday. \u201cHe is the perfect teammate. He didn\u2019t celebrate his fifty; he didn\u2019t celebrate his hundred. He deserves everything that comes his way because he\u2019s an incredible cricketer and an even better bloke.\u201d</p> <p>When he was younger, Stokes, like all kids, loved glory. Now his primary, if not sole motivation is a sense of duty \u2013 to his teammates, and to the talent he has been given.</p> <p>Stokes was always the most responsible and technically correct of England\u2019s middle-order buccaneers. When he returned to the side last year, he took that to the point of self-denial. Now he has found a happier medium, one that allows him, in the same innings, to score two off 66 balls and 74 off 42.</p> <p>Armchair psychoanalysis is a dubious exercise but Bristol does seem to have made Stokes a wiser, warier man. He will never be perfect on or off the field, because that\u2019s not who he is, but he has developed into a different kind of hero \u2013 a superstar with no side to him, and with little discernible ego or swagger. One who hunts glory on behalf of his mates and who will volunteer to go to the precipice every single time.</p>",

The conversation soon turned to the bizarre incident in the final over of normal time, when Martin Guptill\u2019s throw hit Ben Stokes\u2019s bat and raced to the boundary. \u201cThat,\u201d whispered Buttler, \u201cwas the first thing he middled all day.\u201d Buttler\u2019s comment was playful and affectionate, yet there was a bit of truth in it. For almost all of that innings, Stokes was frustrated by his inability to time the ball on a difficult pitch. He hit three fours in his first 85 balls, before the situation demanded that he go nuclear. Stokes has oodles of skill, especially with the bat. He is one of the few batsmen who can play every shot in the 20th- and 21st-century batting textbooks. But his true superpower, the thing that has enabled his twin miracles this summer, is his will. He belongs to that rare group of all-action sporting heroes who believe they can climb Everest with a hangover, or save the Ashes by scoring more in a last-wicket partnership than the whole team managed in the first innings. Stokes did not just bring England back from the dead last Sunday; he brought them back from a cremation. It was an astonishing achievement, euphoric confirmation of his greatness. The relative modesty of Stokes\u2019s numbers in Test cricket \u2013 he averages 36 with the bat, 32 with the ball \u2013 are sometimes used in evidence against him. But trying to assess his impact through statistics is like trying to quantify love. It should surprise nobody if Stokes gets a pair at Old Trafford. He has always had wild fluctuations in form and has been fighting self\u2011doubt ever since, at the age of 14, he puked through nerves before his debut for Cumbria. \u201cI\u2019m going to go through a period of low scores and not got too well,\u201d said Stokes three years ago in his book, Firestarter. \u201cBut all of a sudden I know something can just happen for me. I\u2019m not necessarily a form player, more of an in-the-moment player.\u201d For such a great player, he can be a bit of a klutz. Carlos Brathwaite\u2019s four sixes in the World T20 final will always be part of his story, and his career has been studded with absurd, absent-minded run-outs. Even at Headingley, he played a hideous shot in the first innings and ran out Buttler in the second. His never-ending bowling spell was partly a penance for that poor stroke. Technically, it was two spells, but in reality it was one, as Stokes had three balls off before returning to the attack when Jofra Archer was injured. In all he bowled 24.2 overs. Analysis from CricViz, who hold the largest database in cricket, show it is the longest spell by a pace bowler in international cricket since 2006. Stokes\u2019s self-flagellation increased his determination to ensure England would not lose the Ashes, not on his watch. Stokes is allergic to defeat; that, even more than the pursuit of glory, drives him. It was telling that, off the final ball of the World Cup final, when England needed two to win and one to tie, Stokes\u2019s sole thought was to bunt the ball into a gap so that he would get at least one run and ensure England would live to fight another over. Stokes had some crazy moments of fortune at Lord\u2019s. Whether you make your own luck is debatable but Stokes certainly gives himself the opportunity to get lucky by keeping England in games that would otherwise have been long lost. The Brathwaite experience taught him that if you take a game deep enough, the strangest things can happen. Stokes also knows that, at moments of the highest pressure, something stirs in him: desperation, defiance, a heightened instinct, a bit of genius, and, most of all, an elemental force of personality. The greater the stakes, the more Stokes wants \u2013 needs \u2013 to be involved, which is why his career will always lurch between extremes of success and failure. He is a beacon of moral courage. As a bowler he is selectively used but it is indicative that he took the last wickets when England beat Bangladesh by 22 runs in 2016 and India by 31 runs at Edgbaston in 2018. When the mood takes him, or the situation demands, he will bowl forever. CricViz data shows that in his Test career he has bowled 12 spells of 10 overs or more. The sight of Stokes demonstrably knackered, either while batting or bowling, has become common. In the biggest moments, Stokes cannot hide his fatigue or his emotions \u2013 he could not watch when Jack Leach was batting last Sunday and he was one of the few England players who cried on the field after the World Cup final. He should have a tattoo of a heart on his sleeve. A big part of Stokes\u2019s appeal is that, in an era of media\u2011training and image-consciousness, he is authentic, sometimes to a fault. He looks like a fan who has been placed in the body of Ben Stokes for the day. Many great players enjoy their work; Stokes usually looks almost comically careworn. The enjoyment comes after the event, with a primal roar after he blasts the winning runs \u2013 just imagine how alive he felt at that moment at Headingley \u2013 and then behind closed doors with his mates. Despite all the emotion, Stokes played with startling clarity in both innings. While most spectators, never mind the players, were unable to think straight, Stokes had a precise gameplan each time. He is like a reverse swan \u2013 paddling furiously on the surface, serene under water. In that sense, Stokes is the ideal hero for these melodramatic times. In others, not so much. A judgmental minority, apparently born without the empathy gene, will never forgive or let him forget Bristol, and he is understandably tired of being asked about it. Yet he might reflect that it was a blessing in an extremely good disguise, one that was humbling rather than humiliating. While the year-long fallout was an experience Stokes probably would not wish on Marlon Samuels, it has accelerated his maturity and changed him almost exclusively for the better. He is much less confrontational, without any obvious impact on his ferocious competitiveness, and has become even more selfless. Stokes was always an exemplary team man but now his commitment to the collective verges on the obsessive. \u201cEverything he does is for the team,\u201d said Stuart Broad last Sunday. \u201cHe is the perfect teammate. He didn\u2019t celebrate his fifty; he didn\u2019t celebrate his hundred. He deserves everything that comes his way because he\u2019s an incredible cricketer and an even better bloke.\u201d When he was younger, Stokes, like all kids, loved glory. Now his primary, if not sole motivation is a sense of duty \u2013 to his teammates, and to the talent he has been given. Stokes was always the most responsible and technically correct of England\u2019s middle-order buccaneers. When he returned to the side last year, he took that to the point of self-denial. Now he has found a happier medium, one that allows him, in the same innings, to score two off 66 balls and 74 off 42. Armchair psychoanalysis is a dubious exercise but Bristol does seem to have made Stokes a wiser, warier man. He will never be perfect on or off the field, because that\u2019s not who he is, but he has developed into a different kind of hero \u2013 a superstar with no side to him, and with little discernible ego or swagger. One who hunts glory on behalf of his mates and who will volunteer to go to the precipice every single time.",

      "bodyText": "Crucial elections in two eastern states of Germany could be about to change the political direction of the country, with polls showing the potential of the far right to emerge as the strongest force. Five million Germans are eligible to vote on Sunday in Saxony and Brandenburg in election battles that could have a resounding impact on the federal government in Berlin and have been fuelled by debates on the success and failures of German reunification, with the 30th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall coming this autumn. The anti-immigrant Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD) faces its first real electoral test in the region. At the last state election, five years ago, the party was just a year old and lacking clout. Today, two years after entering the national parliament for the first time, buoyed by its opposition to the arrival in Germany of almost 1 million refugees during the crisis of 2015, it has made sizeable gains. According to final polls, the AfD is expected to receive around 24.5% support in Saxony, and 21% in Brandenburg, the state that encircles the capital, Berlin. The parties that have uninterruptedly dominated the region\u2019s politics since reunification in 1990 \u2013 the Christian Democrats (CDU) in Saxony and the Social Democrats (SPD) in Brandenburg \u2013 are braced for heavy losses. The latest polls show the SPD on around 22% in Brandenburg and the CDU on 32% in Saxony. The Greens, already bolstered by a nationwide rise in the polls, are being touted as the party that could tip the balance of power. They are enjoying 14.5% support in Brandenburg and 11% in Saxony. All parties have ruled out going into coalition with the AfD, meaning that tense negotiations almost certainly lie ahead. Analysts agree that if the AfD tops the polls it will represent the biggest political earthquake for Germany since the end of the cold war, marking the first time a rightwing populist force has taken control in postwar Germany. The size of the AfD\u2019s gains after a campaign focused on appealing to \u2013 and amplifying \u2013 a collective feeling of abandonment have been most keenly felt in Saxony. There, it is expected to take half or a third of seats from the CDU, which in 2014 secured 59 out of 60 constituencies. Its election slogan \u201cVollende die Wende\u201d, or \u201cComplete the transition\u201d \u2013 stealing the phrase used in 1989 to describe the change from communism to liberal democracy \u2013 is an invitation to topple the status quo just as protesters brought about the East German revolution. \u201cThe AfD is not the cause of the upset we\u2019re seeing, neither is it dividing society,\u201d said Andreas Kalbitz, the AfD\u2019s leading candidate in Brandenburg, fresh from an election rally. \u201cThe AfD is the consequence of the failure of others.\u201d Born in Munich, the former paratrooper settled in Brandenburg with his British wife and children more than a decade ago. His contacts with far-right sympathisers have made repeated headlines in Germany in recent months as he positions himself to oust Dietmar Woidke, who has been Brandenburg\u2019s state premier since 2013. Those headlines continued last week when he admitted he had attended a neo-Nazi rally in 2007 in the Greek capital, Athens. Kalbitz insists it is largely western Germans\u2019 lack of empathy towards easterners, and the widespread perception that they plundered the east of its wealth in the immediate aftermath of the collapse of communism, that has fuelled much of the resentment among Brandenburgers. \u201cIt has been forgotten in the west,\u201d he said. \u201cBut people in the east have not forgotten how people came with their fast cars and closed down the businesses, so as to clear the field of competition for western businesses.\u201d Matthias Platzeck, who was Brandenburg\u2019s premier until 2013, said: \u201cDemocracy here is on the precipice of a crisis. People have the overwhelming feeling that, following both the finance and the refugee crises, the state has lost control. \u201cThe AfD is exploiting this latent sense of insecurity and has the same explanation for everything: if your bus is late or a train is cancelled, some Iraqi or other must be to blame.\u201d The campaigns \u2013 the state of Thuringia follows on 27 October \u2013 have thrown the reunification project into sharp relief.

Full of the most exquisite descriptions and judiciously peppered with personal reflections and little biographical flourishes, it was a triumph, securing Fiennes critical and commercial success. Now comes <em>Footnotes</em>, a book that seeks to take a \u201cjourney round Britain in the company of great writers\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Fiennes is brilliantly self-deprecating, a genial and good-hearted presence</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The thesis draws your attention to the extent to which all authors are travel guides, leading the reader into the landscape of their stories, mediating between life on the page and reality. Fiennes, as it happens, is a wonderful companion, showing that the wit and charm that animated <em>Oak and Ash and Thorn</em> still works when applied to the world, rather than just the woods.</p> <p>You can feel the boost that early success has given his writing, too. Everything here is sharper, more confident and, above all, funnier. Whether he\u2019s being butted in the balls by a wolfhound in a Welsh forest, on a hungover tour of the Cadbury\u2019s chocolate factory, or creeping nervously along the cliffs down to Tintagel Castle \u201changing on to the fence with sweaty hands\u201d, Fiennes is brilliantly self-deprecating, a genial and good-hearted presence \u2013 drinking, smoking and tottering his way haphazardly around Britain.</p> <p>In a brief and cheerful preface, Fiennes sets out his hopes for the book. He wants to use a series of journeys undertaken by writers from Enid Blyton to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/27/100-best-novels-moonstone-wilkie-collins\" title=\"\">Wilkie Collins</a> to Boswell and Johnson as the blueprint for his own traipse, passing himself from one author to the next \u201clike a baton in a relay\u201d. He hopes that this will help \u201cto bring modern Britain into focus\u201d, in these \u201crestless times\u201d. And while he is diverted by tempting tangents, and his first \u201ccompanion\u201d, Blyton, doesn\u2019t really journey anywhere at all, I think he largely succeeds. <em>Footnotes</em> paints the reader a nuanced and temporally layered portrait of Britain, showing how the country and its writers have lived in deep and fruitful symbiosis over the 800 years from the earliest writer Fiennes invokes \u2013 Gerald of Wales in the 12th century \u2013 to the present.</p> <p>The real pleasure of the book is the cumulative effect of the time spent with Fiennes and his most regular companions \u2013 Collins, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/charlesdickens\" title=\"\">Charles Dickens</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jul/04/beryl-bainbridge-obituary-an-wilson\" title=\"\">Beryl Bainbridge</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jun/17/jb-priestley-memoir-insight-vanities-friendships\" title=\"\">JB Priestley</a>. Fiennes appears genuinely fond of the writers whose footsteps he follows, illuminating his reflections on British life with well-chosen snatches of literary biography, quotations and some glorious passages of natural history. I didn\u2019t really know that I\u2019d been waiting for a more literary and stylish Bill Bryson to update <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/notes-from-a-small-island.html\" title=\"\"><em>Notes from a Small Island</em></a>, but that\u2019s just what <em>Foot</em><em>notes</em> is, and I loved it.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Footnotes: A Journey Round Britain in the Company of Great Writers </em>by Peter Fiennes<em> </em>is published by Oneworld (\u00a316.99).

      "bodyText": "Oak and Ash and Thorn, Peter Fiennes\u2019s previous book, stood out from the thicket of dendrophilic titles that have emerged in the past few years. Full of the most exquisite descriptions and judiciously peppered with personal reflections and little biographical flourishes, it was a triumph, securing Fiennes critical and commercial success. Now comes Footnotes, a book that seeks to take a \u201cjourney round Britain in the company of great writers\u201d. The thesis draws your attention to the extent to which all authors are travel guides, leading the reader into the landscape of their stories, mediating between life on the page and reality. Fiennes, as it happens, is a wonderful companion, showing that the wit and charm that animated Oak and Ash and Thorn still works when applied to the world, rather than just the woods. You can feel the boost that early success has given his writing, too. Everything here is sharper, more confident and, above all, funnier. Whether he\u2019s being butted in the balls by a wolfhound in a Welsh forest, on a hungover tour of the Cadbury\u2019s chocolate factory, or creeping nervously along the cliffs down to Tintagel Castle \u201changing on to the fence with sweaty hands\u201d, Fiennes is brilliantly self-deprecating, a genial and good-hearted presence \u2013 drinking, smoking and tottering his way haphazardly around Britain. In a brief and cheerful preface, Fiennes sets out his hopes for the book. He wants to use a series of journeys undertaken by writers from Enid Blyton to Wilkie Collins to Boswell and Johnson as the blueprint for his own traipse, passing himself from one author to the next \u201clike a baton in a relay\u201d. He hopes that this will help \u201cto bring modern Britain into focus\u201d, in these \u201crestless times\u201d. And while he is diverted by tempting tangents, and his first \u201ccompanion\u201d, Blyton, doesn\u2019t really journey anywhere at all, I think he largely succeeds. Footnotes paints the reader a nuanced and temporally layered portrait of Britain, showing how the country and its writers have lived in deep and fruitful symbiosis over the 800 years from the earliest writer Fiennes invokes \u2013 Gerald of Wales in the 12th century \u2013 to the present. The real pleasure of the book is the cumulative effect of the time spent with Fiennes and his most regular companions \u2013 Collins, Charles Dickens, Beryl Bainbridge and JB Priestley. Fiennes appears genuinely fond of the writers whose footsteps he follows, illuminating his reflections on British life with well-chosen snatches of literary biography, quotations and some glorious passages of natural history. I didn\u2019t really know that I\u2019d been waiting for a more literary and stylish Bill Bryson to update Notes from a Small Island, but that\u2019s just what Footnotes is, and I loved it. \u2022 Footnotes: A Journey Round Britain in the Company of Great Writers by Peter Fiennes is published by Oneworld (\u00a316.99).

I never dreamt I\u2019d be asked to do this gig. It\u2019s 50 years since the anniversary of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jun/19/stonewall-50th-anniversary-night-that-unleashed-gay-liberation\" title=\"\">Stonewall</a>. It\u2019s so important for me to stand up proudly as a bisexual woman. What I can tell you is that the main colour of the dress will be pewter, with a cape element, a bubble sleeve \u2013 and a reveal! That idea of reveal is very much part of queer culture, and drag. It\u2019s a way of saying this is who I am.</p> <p><strong>We\u2019re speaking on the day that </strong><strong>Pl\u00e1cido Domingo</strong><strong>, one of opera\u2019s most revered names, has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/aug/13/placido-domingo-accused-sexual-harassment\" title=\"\">accused of inappropriate sexual behaviour</a>. Where do things stand with #MeToo and opera?</strong><br>Abuse has cost some who\u2019ve suffered \u2013 women and men too \u2013 their jobs and careers. At last it\u2019s being tackled. Companies are stepping up, some for the first time. Just this last season at one opera house, on the first day of rehearsals, when you normally meet the design team and everyone involved in a production, we were also introduced to the HR people. We were told who to talk to if anything occurred. Yes, it\u2019s uncomfortable to confront these issues but if it\u2019s an abuse of power it has to be dealt with.</p> <p><strong>You\u2019ve spoken out about size and the appearance of opera singers. What\u2019s the most important thing to say?</strong><br>For me it\u2019s a very personal conversation. It\u2019s about health, longevity. If I\u2019m not healthy I can\u2019t do my job. I\u2019m just a few months into quitting dieting \u2013 as I\u2019ve <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jbartonmezzo/status/1155931407031529473\" title=\"\">written on Twitter</a> \u2013 but I\u2019m doing so with the encouragement of a good dietician and doctors, backed up by science and research. I\u2019ve been a binge eater for several years, six of seven nights a week. I couldn\u2019t break the loop. It\u2019s not surprising. There are many good aspects to this wonderful career of singing opera but it\u2019s also stressful. I can\u2019t eat before I perform. It\u2019ll come back up! I use my diaphragm to push the lungs up and the air out. If there\u2019s food there too it all gets a bit cramped. It\u2019s quite common for singers to rely on other comforts to help get through the weeks and months on the road, the loneliness, the pressure. Now I\u2019m learning to trust my own hunger cues and cravings. It\u2019s helping my health, my blood pressure and glucose count, and I\u2019ve even lost some weight.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I have wonderful liberal, hippy parents. Classical music was my rebellion when I hit my teens. I discovered Chopin!</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>But what about appearance on stage?</strong><br>I really am a supporter of having singers of every size on stage. The stories we tell in opera are about human frailties, human dilemmas. Audiences need to commiserate and identify with the characters they\u2019re encountering. I get letters saying \u201cI love your voice, but I love even more seeing a plus-sized woman in a lead romantic role.\u201d Everybody is built differently. I was created with the resonance chambers and sinuses and shape of vocal cords and anatomy that make me a singer. I used to dream of having a long, slim giraffe neck. As it happens, my neck is short and thick, which is perfect for singing heavier roles by Wagner or Verdi. Body size truly doesn\u2019t matter. You can be small with a gargantuan voice if the lung capacity and resonance chambers are large.</p> <p><strong>Are there particular challenges in being bisexual in a field where everyone looks and judges?</strong><br>I came out later in life, not because I was in the closet but because I didn\u2019t know. I was doing <em>Rheingold</em> in Houston, Texas, in 2014 when I realised I was attracted to a woman. Six months later I came out fully. Bisexuality is too often seen as fake. Dearest friends said maybe you\u2019re really a lesbian. And if you date someone of the opposite sex, it\u2019s as if you\u2019re straight again. Neither is the case for me. It\u2019s so important to speak out. Bisexuals are at high risk of abuse, depression, anxiety, suicide. It\u2019s a personal calling for me to be who I am in a loud way. I haven\u2019t had too much backlash, but I\u2019ve had so much support, from all ages, from people saying I\u2019ve helped them understand themselves or others.</p> <p><strong>Your upbringing wasn\u2019t an obvious route into the world of classical music. How did it happen?</strong><br>I have wonderful liberal, chilled, hippy parents. My younger brother and I grew up in the mountains of north-west Georgia \u2013 basically, the middle of nowhere, with no internet or wifi. It\u2019s still like that. My family loved music. My dad and cousins played guitar, banjo, mandolin, fiddle; bluegrass, country, rock, a bit of church music, but no classical or opera. My mother didn\u2019t sing much but has a rather lovely, low voice. I think she\u2019s the reason I\u2019m a mezzo-soprano. But once I was growing up, I wanted to get out and see the world. Classical music was my rebellion when I hit my teens. I discovered Chopin!</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21IFC1JkyvA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/21IFC1JkyvA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=21&amp;v=21IFC1JkyvA\">Watch Jamie Barton in the final of 2013\u2019s Cardiff Singer of the World competition.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p><strong>You studied voice and, in </strong><strong>2007, won the </strong><strong>Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions</strong><strong> for young singers.<br></strong>I had a great music education in my home town at Shorter College, [in Rome, Georgia] and then at Indiana University. But the Met prize was the major push forward. The competition that year was filmed for a documentary and it got me recognition at an important stage.</p> <p><strong>Does any music come more easily to you than others?</strong><br>Hilariously, Wagner is my roll-out-of-bed-and-sing music. It suits my voice and technique. With Verdi I\u2019m treading more carefully. His music is so difficult, requiring vocal acrobatics unlike any other composer. You can\u2019t just learn a Verdi role and go on stage and sing it. You have to work slowly, with a singing coach. A Verdi mezzo has to have low, contralto notes and be able to go up to a high C. So you have to have both an extensive range and the power behind it, in the middle of the voice too. I find that difficult. Some singers have a steely middle range, but mine\u2019s more geared towards beauty. I have to be effective, but at the same time safe. It\u2019s a mighty challenge.</p> <p><strong>Is there one opera you\u2019d tell people to listen to?</strong><br>There are two: Humperdinck\u2019s <em>Hansel and Gretel</em>. It\u2019s got the most beautiful, almost Wagnerian music, and a wonderful story, even if it\u2019s a bit silly. And, at the other extreme, Poulenc\u2019s <em>Dialogues des Carm\u00e9lites</em>.</p> <p><strong>Do you have a singer role model?</strong><br>Absolutely. The American mezzo-soprano <a href=\"http://www.stephanieblythemezzo.com/\" title=\"\">Stephanie Blythe</a>. As a brilliant singer, as a woman who\u2019s made her career the way she wanted.</p> <p><strong>I gather your boyfriend is a massage therapist</strong><strong>\u2026 that sounds ideal.</strong><br>It\u2019s super useful!

Six months later I came out fully. Bisexuality is too often seen as fake. Dearest friends said maybe you\u2019re really a lesbian. And if you date someone of the opposite sex, it\u2019s as if you\u2019re straight again. Neither is the case for me. It\u2019s so important to speak out. Bisexuals are at high risk of abuse, depression, anxiety, suicide. It\u2019s a personal calling for me to be who I am in a loud way. I haven\u2019t had too much backlash, but I\u2019ve had so much support, from all ages, from people saying I\u2019ve helped them understand themselves or others. Your upbringing wasn\u2019t an obvious route into the world of classical music. How did it happen? I have wonderful liberal, chilled, hippy parents. My younger brother and I grew up in the mountains of north-west Georgia \u2013 basically, the middle of nowhere, with no internet or wifi. It\u2019s still like that. My family loved music. My dad and cousins played guitar, banjo, mandolin, fiddle; bluegrass, country, rock, a bit of church music, but no classical or opera. My mother didn\u2019t sing much but has a rather lovely, low voice. I think she\u2019s the reason I\u2019m a mezzo-soprano. But once I was growing up, I wanted to get out and see the world. Classical music was my rebellion when I hit my teens. I discovered Chopin! You studied voice and, in 2007, won the Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions for young singers. I had a great music education in my home town at Shorter College, [in Rome, Georgia] and then at Indiana University. But the Met prize was the major push forward. The competition that year was filmed for a documentary and it got me recognition at an important stage. Does any music come more easily to you than others? Hilariously, Wagner is my roll-out-of-bed-and-sing music. It suits my voice and technique. With Verdi I\u2019m treading more carefully. His music is so difficult, requiring vocal acrobatics unlike any other composer. You can\u2019t just learn a Verdi role and go on stage and sing it. You have to work slowly, with a singing coach. A Verdi mezzo has to have low, contralto notes and be able to go up to a high C. So you have to have both an extensive range and the power behind it, in the middle of the voice too. I find that difficult. Some singers have a steely middle range, but mine\u2019s more geared towards beauty. I have to be effective, but at the same time safe. It\u2019s a mighty challenge. Is there one opera you\u2019d tell people to listen to? There are two: Humperdinck\u2019s Hansel and Gretel. It\u2019s got the most beautiful, almost Wagnerian music, and a wonderful story, even if it\u2019s a bit silly. And, at the other extreme, Poulenc\u2019s Dialogues des Carm\u00e9lites. Do you have a singer role model? Absolutely. The American mezzo-soprano Stephanie Blythe. As a brilliant singer, as a woman who\u2019s made her career the way she wanted. I gather your boyfriend is a massage therapist\u2026 that sounds ideal. It\u2019s super useful! He was in the tech industry before. So if I ever have a computer problem, or a back issue, I\u2019m totally covered. Is he available on loan? He\u2019s so totally kind he\u2019d help anyone\u2026 I\u2019d be happy to loan him out, within reason.",

      "body": "<p>The hoopla around the launch of Margaret Atwood\u2019s <em>The Testaments</em> is more reminiscent of the unveiling of an iPhone or something Pok\u00e9mon-related than that of a mere book. On the evening of 9 September, 400 people will gather outside the doors of Waterstones\u2019 Piccadilly store in London for the midnight release of the sequel to <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/handmaid-s-tale-530018.html\" title=\"\">The Handmaid\u2019s Tale</a></em>, her dystopian novel-turned-feminist touchstone-turned-meme-machine.</p> <p>Fans, invited to dress up in the regulation ankle-length cloaks and bonnets worn by the handmaids in Atwood\u2019s fundamentalist republic of Gilead, will snake round the block waiting for what Waterstones is calling a \u201cone-night festival\u201d of, immersive theatre, political speeches and themed cocktails. At 8.15pm doors will open to a four-storey Gileadean Glastonbury, featuring guest appearances from actor Romola Garai, activist Caroline Criado-Perez, <em>Guilty Feminist</em> podcaster Deborah Frances-White, plus a discussion of Atwood\u2019s legacy with authors Jeanette Winterson, Elif Shafak, Neil Gaiman and AM Homes.</p> <p>It\u2019s an inventive, slightly surreal programme of events that \u2013 like Atwood \u2013 is a bit political, a bit geeky, a bit cerebral and unapologetically big on silly hats. It\u2019s the ultimate hashtaggable celebration of a novelist who in the sixth decade of her career, having written more than 50 books of fiction, poetry and criticism, has mastered both Twitter (1.9 million followers) and Instagram (82,300). You know a writer has become a global phenomenon when the support act for their launch event includes two rivals for this year\u2019s Booker prize. Winterson and Shafak\u2019s novels were both longlisted, along with <em>The Testaments</em>, back in July.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>She\u2019s always before her time. Each novel is about something people become incredibly interested in half an hour later</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At 11pm on the night of the launch, the tiny, sprite-like 79-year-old Canadian author will emerge to read the first extracts of a 432-page book that has been kept under the tightest of wraps. Only her closest associates have glimpsed the manuscript \u2013 apart from the Booker judges, who have described it as a \u201cterrifying and exhilarating\u201d follow-up to her 1985 novel. Publisher Liz Calder, who was one of Atwood\u2019s longest-standing editors, is on this year\u2019s judging panel. While she\u2019s not allowed to reveal anything about the book\u2019s content, she will say: \u201cIt represents not the work of a writer who might be at the end of her career but it\u2019s like her peak, it\u2019s amazing in that sense.\u201d</p> <p>All we know is that <em>The Testaments</em> is set 15 years after the final scene in the first book, in which narrator Offred is hauled into a van by heavies, who might be from the resistance or the regime that extinguished so many of the human freedoms we take for granted. When Atwood leaves the stage at midnight, fans will finally lay their hands on a book many have waited 34 years to read.</p> <p>Atwood\u2019s books have sold millions. She has won the Booker, for <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/sep/17/fiction.bookerprize2000\" title=\"\">The Blind Assassin</a></em> in 2000, and had five other novels shortlisted. She has yet to be given the Nobel prize for literature but that is widely seen as an error to be righted. When an embarrassed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/05/kazuo-ishiguro-wins-the-nobel-prize-in-literature\" title=\"\">Kazuo Ishiguro</a> was honoured with the award in 2017, he apologised to the Canadian writer: \u201cI always thought it would be Margaret Atwood very soon; and I still think that, I still hope that.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1b3e1a6024af7bb2d26148fc17b5f27b19af81ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1b3e1a6024af7bb2d26148fc17b5f27b19af81ae/0_85_3000_1799/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elisabeth Moss in the US TV adaptation of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elisabeth Moss in the US TV adaptation of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: MGM/Hulu</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While she has been prolific throughout her career, there is little doubt that the Emmy award-winning TV adaptation of <em>The Handmaid\u2019s Tale</em> has helped make Atwood a superstar. It has connected the novelist to a vast new audience fascinated by her vivid nightmare of an America in ecological meltdown and a totalitarian regime that is systematically stripping women of hard-won rights, leaving many as little more than walking wombs. The timing has been crucial. Since the election of President Trump, the novel\u2019s depiction of misogyny and witch-hunts feel chillingly prophetic and the red-cloaked handmaids have become an international symbol of women\u2019s resistance.</p> <p>But even before these developments, the novel had become a modern classic, translated into more than 40 languages, studied in schools and adapted into a film, an opera, a ballet and a graphic novel. \u201cI\u2019m a serious writer,\u201d Atwood once said. \u201cI never expected to become a popular one.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe couldn\u2019t have seen that <em>The Handmaid\u2019s Tale</em> would do what it did,\u201d Winterson says. \u201cShe\u2019s just got on with her work right from the beginning and allowed all this success to happen. But <em>The Testaments</em> has come at the right moment for her as well as us because she\u2019s now a real sage.\u201d</p> <p>Sage she may be but this level of ceremony, cosplay and cult worship \u2013 involving no fewer than 120 Waterstones branches \u2013 is usually reserved for long-dead authors or Harry Potter. Certainly, the craft sessions and costume competitions celebrating her new novel seem a little kitsch, especially for a writer who delivers such apocalyptic prophecies about environmental havoc, predatory capitalism and overnight assaults on human rights. However, Atwood wouldn\u2019t necessarily see the contradiction:</p> <p>\u201cShe always takes herself seriously, but she has a great respect for play and inventiveness,\u201d says her agent, Karolina Sutton. She recalls an occasion three years ago when she accompanied Atwood to the basement of a King\u2019s Cross pub for the Kitschies, awards that celebrate speculative fiction. The prize was a knitted octopus tentacle, so Atwood insisted they wear homemade orange molluscs on their heads. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s unusual about her, to have someone so intellectual who is so playful.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"52e720da3333898ffa7897bb0682564c27a34d16\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/52e720da3333898ffa7897bb0682564c27a34d16/448_219_2398_1439/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Moss and Atwood at the Emmy awards in 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Moss and Atwood at the Emmy awards in 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Buckner/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Still, when you\u2019re reading about totalitarianism in <em>The Handmaid\u2019s Tale</em> or man-eating mutants in the Oryx and Crake trilogy or child sexbots in her 2015 novel, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/14/the-heart-goes-last-margaret-atwood-review\" title=\"\">The Heart Goes Last</a></em>, you may relish her wit and verve, but you never lose the eerie feeling that each feature of her dystopias might soon materialise in our own society \u2013 if they haven\u2019t already. In recent years, Atwood has been hailed a prophet for creating stories about climate disaster, lab-manufactured meat, the western fertility crisis and human organs grown inside pigs, as well as societies increasingly ruled by misogynistic strongmen, years before they were on most people\u2019s radar.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s always before her time. Each novel is about something people become incredibly interested in half an hour later,\u201d says Carmen Callil, founder of Virago Press, the publisher of books by women, who back in the mid-1970s was the first to bring Atwood\u2019s work to a UK readership. When she first met the author over a lunch at Mon Plaisir in Covent Garden, she says she found her so \u201cferociously clever\u201d that she \u201cexploded my mind\u201d.</p> <p>Atwood is a writer with many gears; she can turn out transfixing character studies of Victorian women, poetry about sex between snails, essays on the history of debt and apocalyptic stories about bioengineering. Many novelists only dare to write about technology once it enters the mainstream, but she is interested in it from its inception \u2013 and rarely does it feel heavy-handed because it\u2019s never been a chore for her to explore science in her fiction. It\u2019s a quick hop from organ harvesting to sexual intimacy to high farce.</p> <p>Callil says: \u201cThere is this tradition of women\u2019s writing that uses irony and lightness of touch to deliver monstrous concepts and beliefs. It\u2019s that ironic voice that has helped her seamlessly move from one generation of reader to the next. That is the test of a great writer.\u201d</p> <p><em>The Handmaid\u2019s Tale</em> remains Atwood\u2019s most protean novel, with so much to say about how quickly and easily democracy can be dismantled. It remains one of the finest novels ever written on the relationship between sex, power and the social position of women. The novelist Valerie Martin, who was the first person to read it in manuscript, predicted a hit: \u201cI told her: \u2018You\u2019re going to be very rich,\u2019\u201d Martin says. \u201cUsually you read speculative fiction and squirm when sex comes up but she really gets how dangerous it is.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1444041beee39095082e4577a605e1e17968894a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1444041beee39095082e4577a605e1e17968894a/0_43_3000_2180/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In Toronto, 1972.

She gets sex and I think it\u2019s because she understands power. She\u2019s not a moralising writer but she\u2019s a great observer and very honest. When you read her, you feel enlarged as a human being.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jul/24/not-read-them-yet-a-cheats-guide-to-the-2019-booker-prize-longlist\">Not read them yet? A cheat's guide to the 2019 Booker prize longlist</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Many novelists have written warnings about a future that come to seem eerily prescient. But Atwood is rare in that she has been around long enough to see systems come and go, witness various waves of feminism \u2013 and the reactions against them \u2013 and managed to respond in a second book. Such longevity, and depth of experience, is a surely a new experience for a writer.</p> <p>Born in 1939, a few months after the outbreak of the second world war, Atwood spent much of her early years in the wilds of Canada, where her father, Carl, an entomologist, was studying leaf-eating insects. Her childhood was unusual. Her mother, also called Margaret, was a dietician who liked being in the wilds so she didn\u2019t have to do housework. There was no mains electricity and few roads. Atwood \u2013 known as Peggy to her family and close friends \u2013 and her older brother, Harold (her sister, Ruth, was born later, in 1951), were schooled at home with textbooks that their mother obtained. If they worked through enough pages, they were left to their own devices.</p> <p>This isolated childhood in the wilderness made Atwood fearless and pragmatic. Martin describes how when the family were staying on an island, the writer and her brother \u201cdug a hole for an outhouse and nobody told them to stop so they dug this really, really deep hole. It\u2019s still there, I believe, one of the wonders of the family. She knows how to get along without anything and if you have that knowledge, it makes you not care so much about unimportant things.\u201d</p> <p>If the weather was bad, the Atwood children would read Greek myths, Robinson Crusoe and HG Wells or re-enact the Battle of Waterloo with stuffed toys (Atwood is still a keen student of military history). One game with her bunnies inspired her to create a world of superheroes who inhabited a place called \u201cMischiefland\u201d. Along with Harold, she wrote her own comics, often about space travel. But it wasn\u2019t until she was 16 that the notion of writing for a living occurred to her. \u201c[A] large invisible thumb descended from the sky and pressed down on the top of my head. A poem formed,\u201d is how she described it. After studying at the University of Toronto, and then in Harvard, she wrote her first novel, <em>The Edible Woman</em>, published in 1969.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8b53f21549156a2e599c69b82057792658078c7c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8b53f21549156a2e599c69b82057792658078c7c/0_188_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"At the Hay literary festival, accompanied by handmaidens.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">At the Hay literary festival, accompanied by handmaidens.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By then, she had married the writer Jim Polk, a relationship that ended in divorce in 1973. Shortly after, she became involved with novelist and ecological campaigner Graeme Gibson. The couple, who live in Toronto, have been devoted to each other ever since and have one daughter, Jess, born in 1976 and now an art historian who lives in Brooklyn with Atwood\u2019s grandson.</p> <p>Gibson has been diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s, and also suffers problems with his legs \u2013 but friends say he still travels with Atwood. The couple are used to an itinerant lifestyle, often spending several months a year in Norwich (where Atwood writes in local bookshop cafes). Earlier this year, they went on a boat around Australia and New Zealand. However, Gibson\u2019s health may mean Atwood has to reduce the amount of travel she undertakes. \u201cShe\u2019s being very brave about it and so is their daughter, Jess,\u201d Martin says. \u201cThey\u2019re going to figure out how to deal with it as they go along.\u201d</p> <p>One senses Atwood wants to seize every opportunity for fun. She delights in playing the mischievous granny, dispensing eldritch predictions. During a recent appearance at the Moon festival in Greenwich \u2013 one of many eccentric grassroots events she supports \u2013 she stood in front of a packed-out theatre and sang the opening of Carl Orff\u2019s <em>Carmina Burana</em> before performing bird calls. Bets are on as to whether she will break into song or cast a spell when she appears at the National Theatre, the night after the midnight launch, to discuss <em>The Testaments</em> for the first time.</p> <p>At the event, which will be <a href=\"https://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/shows/margaret-atwood-live\" title=\"\">livestreamed</a> to more than 1,500 cinemas worldwide, BBC broadcaster Samira Ahmed will chair a Q&amp;A session with fans who have tweeted their questions to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/askatwood?src=hash\" title=\"\">#askatwood</a>, and actors (including Lily James) will read extracts from the book. Tickets sold out in a day, though 500 UK cinemas will be screening the event, which the organisers claim is comparable to the popularity of a Marvel movie. Atwood may be two months shy of her 80th birthday, but her star is still on the rise, a regular fixture at red-carpet events and in women\u2019s fashion magazines.</p> <p>Martin believes that now that <em>The Handmaid\u2019s Tale</em> has entered popular mythology. \u201cIn some ways, the book has been spun away from her,\u201d she says. \u201cPerhaps what\u2019s happening with this new novel is that she\u2019s pulling it back in.\u201d</p> <p>I ask how much control Atwood likes to have. \u201cA lot\u2026\u201d Martin replies, drily, \u201calthough not consciously at all. It\u2019s necessary to control things in her world. She pays attention and is very good at understanding market forces and what people respond to.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"680a664ae94eedf251504eed33b17b944c3b8e82\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/680a664ae94eedf251504eed33b17b944c3b8e82/0_0_1672_2560/653.jpg\" alt=\"The forthcoming sequel to The Handmaid\u2019s Tale.\" width=\"653\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The forthcoming sequel to The Handmaid\u2019s Tale.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As a measure of her popularity, <em>The Handmaid\u2019s Tale</em> is the most borrowed adult novel from London libraries, while Waterstones reports a 160% sales increase across all Atwood titles since the title of <em>The Testaments</em> was revealed. By coincidence, fashion chain Whistles\u2019s autumn womenswear collection is dominated by the same navy blue and lime green colour scheme as Noma Bar\u2019s eye-popping jacket design for <em>The Testaments</em>. Over the coming weeks, it won\u2019t be unusual to see murals of handmaids on bookshop walls or teams of booksellers parading through city centres with placards reading \u201cNolite te bastardes carborundorum\u201d, a feminist rallying cry from the book which roughly translates as \u201cDon\u2019t let the bastards grind you down\u201d.</p> <p>Such is the iron-clad security around the sequel that predicting its content is a little like writing a horoscope. Atwood has dropped a few breadcrumbs here and there. \u201cEverything you\u2019ve ever asked me about Gilead and its inner workings is the inspiration for this book,\u201d she has said. \u201cWell, almost everything! The other inspiration is the world we\u2019ve been living in.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll I know is that it\u2019s three parts and [with] three different voices that are not in <em>The Handmaid\u2019s Tale,</em> so it\u2019s expanding it,\u201d says Martin. Whether or not that\u2019s true, the fact there are three narrators would suggest that Offred has been sidelined, perhaps in favour of the Marthas, the lower caste of women who wear green cloaks. Equally, the green of the cover could represent nature and the environment. Some Atwood fans believe the novel will focus on the climate crisis \u2013 especially its impact on women \u2013 since that is what she is preoccupied by these days. Winterson says she would be surprised if <em>The Testaments</em> wasn\u2019t an environmentalist story.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s part of what <em>The Handmaid\u2019s Tale</em> is about,\u201d Winterson says. \u201cHow would we respond to the issue? And we probably will respond in a totalitarian way. When the first big smash hits the west, I\u2019m sure martial law will be introduced. Given that the west has moved so sharply to the right, I can\u2019t imagine it won\u2019t be an excuse for those powers to shut down all the things that have worried them so far. Just as it is at the beginning of <em>The Handmaid\u2019s Tale,</em> when none of the women can get money out of their bank accounts any more.\u201d</p> <p>Novelist Naomi Alderman echoes the point. Atwood mentored Alderman for a year while she developed the concept for her bestselling novel <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/nov/13/the-power-naomi-alderman-review-shocking-satire-gender-war\" title=\"\">The Power</a></em>, a sci-fi story about what happens when teenage girls discover they have the power to electrocute others. The part of <em>The Handmaid\u2019s Tale</em> that still unnerves her most is when women are robbed of their financial independence: \u201cHow simply it happens, how easily, how convincingly. Just cut off all women\u2019s credit cards and bank cards. Just declare it illegal to employ a woman,\u201d says Alderman. \u201cIt\u2019s something that could happen to all of us, without any new technology needing to be invented. All it would take would be a bad government, a war, a stolen election.

She has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/nov/23/canadian-authors-row-creative-writing-tutor-sacking-margaret-atwood-yann-martel\" title=\"\">faced a backlash for calling for due process</a> for a University of British Columbia professor who was accused of sexual misconduct last year. But she has always expressed ambivalence about the feminist tag.</p> <p>Goodings says there is nothing \u201csloppy\u201d or \u201csentimental\u201d about her view of women: \u201cShe is so much about equality but one thing she always says is that if women are going to be equal to men, we must also see that they do bad things too. There was a school of feminism that felt sisterhood was everything and that if women ruled the world, it would be entirely different, but she doesn\u2019t have much truck with that. She\u2019s pro-women but she doesn\u2019t want to whitewash the truth.\u201d</p> <p>Friends point out that if you read Atwood\u2019s fiction carefully, it cuts to the heart of how cruel and corrupt women can be. In <em>The Handmaid\u2019s Tale</em>, we get Offred\u2019s memories of her childhood with her mother, who was a 1970s feminist. She has a phrase about how men are just God\u2019s way of making more women \u2013 and winds up burning books. Goodings says: \u201cIf you are a woman, you certainly know how horrible women can be. She faces up to it in <em>The Robber Bride</em> [1993]. There was a nasty woman who stole other people\u2019s husbands. You look at <em>Cat\u2019s Eye</em> [a novel about female bullying published in 1988], which is all about what little girls do to other little girls. When we published that, people were astonished. The reviews said it was <em>Lord of the Flies</em> for girls. The men I know were staggered by that book!\u201d</p> <p>Martin says Atwood isn\u2019t necessarily comfortable with the idea of being a famous feminist. \u201cIt\u2019s sad how some people absorb what they find in her work on such a banal level,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople who dress in costumes and go stand around the street is sad to me. When she talks about power, she\u2019s careful to make clear that the women are in power as well and what we\u2019re talking about is human tendencies, not just male and female tendencies. But obviously the condition of women historically is of interest to her.\u201d</p> <p>Winterson believes Atwood is a \u201cproper feminist\u201d because she has helped champion so many other women \u2013 but can understand why she has resisted the term. \u201cIt\u2019s the fear of being labelled, just as she resisted the science-fiction label and wanted to call it \u2018speculative fiction\u2019. Labels are annoying and usually they are limiting. I used to hate being called a gay writer because I knew damn well it was about patronising men trying to limit the scope of the work.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo one will influence her choices,\u201d says Karolina Sutton. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t chase trends, she\u2019s not interested in following success. If there\u2019s something that interests her about humanity she will write about it.\u201d Sutton, an agent with many big-name authors on her roster, says she has never met anyone as \u201csuperhuman\u201d as Atwood. \u201cShe\u2019s ahead of everyone in the room\u2026 she doesn\u2019t make mistakes. She\u2019ll be asked to write a 3,000-word piece about a subject that\u2019s just thrown at her \u2013 on plastics or the Russian revolution. If there\u2019s a phone at hand, she will do it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6548a997aa3c94963c841cf7ce9a6545af8ffeac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6548a997aa3c94963c841cf7ce9a6545af8ffeac/73_320_4265_2560/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trying out the LongPen at the London Book Fair in 2006.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trying out the LongPen at the London Book Fair in 2006.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Lee/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Friends say she can be very tough. \u201cI\u2019ve seen her make strong women quail,\u201d says Calder. But they all speak of her generosity. \u201cShe\u2019s big-hearted,\u201d Winterson says, \u201cand the older I get, the more important I think that is, to be big-hearted towards life and not worry too much about your own position within it.\u201d Atwood also likes a prank. Alderman says that the day after they first met, she tricked her into thinking she could speak Anglo-Saxon. \u201cIt seemed believable! Who was I to say? She got a good laugh out of that one.\u201d</p> <p>Atwood is reportedly in good health and has always been disciplined about her diet. Martin jokes that she is so productive \u2013 baking pies, hosting large dinners, knitting sweaters, signing books and lending support to charities and community campaigns \u2013 that she must have a secret double chained to a desk in a windowless room in Saskatchewan, maniacally typing her manuscripts. \u201cI\u2019ve spent a lot of time with her, days on end, and I never see her write!\u201d Martin laughs. \u201cI don\u2019t get when she does it! I think she\u2019s made out of space-age plastic or something.\u201d</p> <p>Calder, who was Atwood\u2019s UK editor in the 1980s and 90s, notes that she constantly renews her working methods. She was the first person to use the story-sharing website Wattpad; she even invented, with her stepson, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/mar/06/topstories3.books\" title=\"\">a remote book-signing device called the LongPen</a> that allows her to sign books for fans all over the world. Calder also describes how one year, Atwood decided to overhaul the process by which her books were edited, having grown fed up with responding to different editors around the world: she called a summit. \u201cWe all trooped to Toronto where she presented us each with the new manuscript which was beautifully tied up with a blue bow. We read solidly for two days without consultation and we didn\u2019t discuss it until we had to put our suggestions to her \u2013 it was immensely practical.\u201d</p> <p>The \u201csummits\u201d continue to this day, and often conclude with a snowy walk to her house for supper. In January, a smaller group flew to Toronto, where it was minus 20C, to discuss <em>The Testaments</em>. Sutton says: \u201cIt\u2019s an editorial process like no other and she makes it very special for everyone. There\u2019s always more theatre, it\u2019s more creative. But no one can dictate to Margaret Atwood! She will say: \u2018Well, everyone wants it to be a different book but it is my book and it is what it is.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Atwood might joke that \u201call the books are compensation for being short\u201d but she\u2019s rarely self-deprecating. Goodings says she\u2019s not embarrassed by her power. \u201cShe wields it cleverly, I think. She\u2019s still very ambitious.\u201d Without her, the end of the world wouldn\u2019t be half so entertaining.</p> <p><em>The Testaments is published by Vintage (\u00a320).

      "bodyText": "The hoopla around the launch of Margaret Atwood\u2019s The Testaments is more reminiscent of the unveiling of an iPhone or something Pok\u00e9mon-related than that of a mere book. On the evening of 9 September, 400 people will gather outside the doors of Waterstones\u2019 Piccadilly store in London for the midnight release of the sequel to The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, her dystopian novel-turned-feminist touchstone-turned-meme-machine. Fans, invited to dress up in the regulation ankle-length cloaks and bonnets worn by the handmaids in Atwood\u2019s fundamentalist republic of Gilead, will snake round the block waiting for what Waterstones is calling a \u201cone-night festival\u201d of, immersive theatre, political speeches and themed cocktails. At 8.15pm doors will open to a four-storey Gileadean Glastonbury, featuring guest appearances from actor Romola Garai, activist Caroline Criado-Perez, Guilty Feminist podcaster Deborah Frances-White, plus a discussion of Atwood\u2019s legacy with authors Jeanette Winterson, Elif Shafak, Neil Gaiman and AM Homes. It\u2019s an inventive, slightly surreal programme of events that \u2013 like Atwood \u2013 is a bit political, a bit geeky, a bit cerebral and unapologetically big on silly hats. It\u2019s the ultimate hashtaggable celebration of a novelist who in the sixth decade of her career, having written more than 50 books of fiction, poetry and criticism, has mastered both Twitter (1.9 million followers) and Instagram (82,300). You know a writer has become a global phenomenon when the support act for their launch event includes two rivals for this year\u2019s Booker prize. Winterson and Shafak\u2019s novels were both longlisted, along with The Testaments, back in July. At 11pm on the night of the launch, the tiny, sprite-like 79-year-old Canadian author will emerge to read the first extracts of a 432-page book that has been kept under the tightest of wraps. Only her closest associates have glimpsed the manuscript \u2013 apart from the Booker judges, who have described it as a \u201cterrifying and exhilarating\u201d follow-up to her 1985 novel. Publisher Liz Calder, who was one of Atwood\u2019s longest-standing editors, is on this year\u2019s judging panel. While she\u2019s not allowed to reveal anything about the book\u2019s content, she will say: \u201cIt represents not the work of a writer who might be at the end of her career but it\u2019s like her peak, it\u2019s amazing in that sense.\u201d All we know is that The Testaments is set 15 years after the final scene in the first book, in which narrator Offred is hauled into a van by heavies, who might be from the resistance or the regime that extinguished so many of the human freedoms we take for granted. When Atwood leaves the stage at midnight, fans will finally lay their hands on a book many have waited 34 years to read. Atwood\u2019s books have sold millions. She has won the Booker, for The Blind Assassin in 2000, and had five other novels shortlisted. She has yet to be given the Nobel prize for literature but that is widely seen as an error to be righted. When an embarrassed Kazuo Ishiguro was honoured with the award in 2017, he apologised to the Canadian writer: \u201cI always thought it would be Margaret Atwood very soon; and I still think that, I still hope that.\u201d While she has been prolific throughout her career, there is little doubt that the Emmy award-winning TV adaptation of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale has helped make Atwood a superstar. It has connected the novelist to a vast new audience fascinated by her vivid nightmare of an America in ecological meltdown and a totalitarian regime that is systematically stripping women of hard-won rights, leaving many as little more than walking wombs. The timing has been crucial. Since the election of President Trump, the novel\u2019s depiction of misogyny and witch-hunts feel chillingly prophetic and the red-cloaked handmaids have become an international symbol of women\u2019s resistance. But even before these developments, the novel had become a modern classic, translated into more than 40 languages, studied in schools and adapted into a film, an opera, a ballet and a graphic novel. \u201cI\u2019m a serious writer,\u201d Atwood once said. \u201cI never expected to become a popular one.\u201d \u201cShe couldn\u2019t have seen that The Handmaid\u2019s Tale would do what it did,\u201d Winterson says. \u201cShe\u2019s just got on with her work right from the beginning and allowed all this success to happen. But The Testaments has come at the right moment for her as well as us because she\u2019s now a real sage.\u201d Sage she may be but this level of ceremony, cosplay and cult worship \u2013 involving no fewer than 120 Waterstones branches \u2013 is usually reserved for long-dead authors or Harry Potter. Certainly, the craft sessions and costume competitions celebrating her new novel seem a little kitsch, especially for a writer who delivers such apocalyptic prophecies about environmental havoc, predatory capitalism and overnight assaults on human rights. However, Atwood wouldn\u2019t necessarily see the contradiction: \u201cShe always takes herself seriously, but she has a great respect for play and inventiveness,\u201d says her agent, Karolina Sutton. She recalls an occasion three years ago when she accompanied Atwood to the basement of a King\u2019s Cross pub for the Kitschies, awards that celebrate speculative fiction. The prize was a knitted octopus tentacle, so Atwood insisted they wear homemade orange molluscs on their heads. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s unusual about her, to have someone so intellectual who is so playful.\u201d Still, when you\u2019re reading about totalitarianism in The Handmaid\u2019s Tale or man-eating mutants in the Oryx and Crake trilogy or child sexbots in her 2015 novel, The Heart Goes Last, you may relish her wit and verve, but you never lose the eerie feeling that each feature of her dystopias might soon materialise in our own society \u2013 if they haven\u2019t already. In recent years, Atwood has been hailed a prophet for creating stories about climate disaster, lab-manufactured meat, the western fertility crisis and human organs grown inside pigs, as well as societies increasingly ruled by misogynistic strongmen, years before they were on most people\u2019s radar. \u201cShe\u2019s always before her time. Each novel is about something people become incredibly interested in half an hour later,\u201d says Carmen Callil, founder of Virago Press, the publisher of books by women, who back in the mid-1970s was the first to bring Atwood\u2019s work to a UK readership. When she first met the author over a lunch at Mon Plaisir in Covent Garden, she says she found her so \u201cferociously clever\u201d that she \u201cexploded my mind\u201d. Atwood is a writer with many gears; she can turn out transfixing character studies of Victorian women, poetry about sex between snails, essays on the history of debt and apocalyptic stories about bioengineering. Many novelists only dare to write about technology once it enters the mainstream, but she is interested in it from its inception \u2013 and rarely does it feel heavy-handed because it\u2019s never been a chore for her to explore science in her fiction. It\u2019s a quick hop from organ harvesting to sexual intimacy to high farce. Callil says: \u201cThere is this tradition of women\u2019s writing that uses irony and lightness of touch to deliver monstrous concepts and beliefs. It\u2019s that ironic voice that has helped her seamlessly move from one generation of reader to the next. That is the test of a great writer.\u201d The Handmaid\u2019s Tale remains Atwood\u2019s most protean novel, with so much to say about how quickly and easily democracy can be dismantled. It remains one of the finest novels ever written on the relationship between sex, power and the social position of women. The novelist Valerie Martin, who was the first person to read it in manuscript, predicted a hit: \u201cI told her: \u2018You\u2019re going to be very rich,\u2019\u201d Martin says. \u201cUsually you read speculative fiction and squirm when sex comes up but she really gets how dangerous it is.\u201d Lennie Goodings, publisher of Virago Press, who has known Atwood since the late 1970s, agrees. \u201cI love the sexual politics of her books. She gets sex and I think it\u2019s because she understands power. She\u2019s not a moralising writer but she\u2019s a great observer and very honest. When you read her, you feel enlarged as a human being.\u201d Many novelists have written warnings about a future that come to seem eerily prescient. But Atwood is rare in that she has been around long enough to see systems come and go, witness various waves of feminism \u2013 and the reactions against them \u2013 and managed to respond in a second book. Such longevity, and depth of experience, is a surely a new experience for a writer. Born in 1939, a few months after the outbreak of the second world war, Atwood spent much of her early years in the wilds of Canada, where her father, Carl, an entomologist, was studying leaf-eating insects. Her childhood was unusual. Her mother, also called Margaret, was a dietician who liked being in the wilds so she didn\u2019t have to do housework. There was no mains electricity and few roads. Atwood \u2013 known as Peggy to her family and close friends \u2013 and her older brother, Harold (her sister, Ruth, was born later, in 1951), were schooled at home with textbooks that their mother obtained. If they worked through enough pages, they were left to their own devices. This isolated childhood in the wilderness made Atwood fearless and pragmatic. Martin describes how when the family were staying on an island, the writer and her brother \u201cdug a hole for an outhouse and nobody told them to stop so they dug this really, really deep hole. It\u2019s still there, I believe, one of the wonders of the family. She knows how to get along without anything and if you have that knowledge, it makes you not care so much about unimportant things.\u201d If the weather was bad, the Atwood children would read Greek myths, Robinson Crusoe and HG Wells or re-enact the Battle of Waterloo with stuffed toys (Atwood is still a keen student of military history). One game with her bunnies inspired her to create a world of superheroes who inhabited a place called \u201cMischiefland\u201d. Along with Harold, she wrote her own comics, often about space travel. But it wasn\u2019t until she was 16 that the notion of writing for a living occurred to her. \u201c[A] large invisible thumb descended from the sky and pressed down on the top of my head. A poem formed,\u201d is how she described it. After studying at the University of Toronto, and then in Harvard, she wrote her first novel, The Edible Woman, published in 1969. By then, she had married the writer Jim Polk, a relationship that ended in divorce in 1973. Shortly after, she became involved with novelist and ecological campaigner Graeme Gibson. The couple, who live in Toronto, have been devoted to each other ever since and have one daughter, Jess, born in 1976 and now an art historian who lives in Brooklyn with Atwood\u2019s grandson. Gibson has been diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s, and also suffers problems with his legs \u2013 but friends say he still travels with Atwood. The couple are used to an itinerant lifestyle, often spending several months a year in Norwich (where Atwood writes in local bookshop cafes). Earlier this year, they went on a boat around Australia and New Zealand. However, Gibson\u2019s health may mean Atwood has to reduce the amount of travel she undertakes. \u201cShe\u2019s being very brave about it and so is their daughter, Jess,\u201d Martin says. \u201cThey\u2019re going to figure out how to deal with it as they go along.\u201d One senses Atwood wants to seize every opportunity for fun. She delights in playing the mischievous granny, dispensing eldritch predictions. During a recent appearance at the Moon festival in Greenwich \u2013 one of many eccentric grassroots events she supports \u2013 she stood in front of a packed-out theatre and sang the opening of Carl Orff\u2019s Carmina Burana before performing bird calls. Bets are on as to whether she will break into song or cast a spell when she appears at the National Theatre, the night after the midnight launch, to discuss The Testaments for the first time. At the event, which will be livestreamed to more than 1,500 cinemas worldwide, BBC broadcaster Samira Ahmed will chair a Q&amp;A session with fans who have tweeted their questions to #askatwood, and actors (including Lily James) will read extracts from the book. Tickets sold out in a day, though 500 UK cinemas will be screening the event, which the organisers claim is comparable to the popularity of a Marvel movie. Atwood may be two months shy of her 80th birthday, but her star is still on the rise, a regular fixture at red-carpet events and in women\u2019s fashion magazines. Martin believes that now that The Handmaid\u2019s Tale has entered popular mythology. \u201cIn some ways, the book has been spun away from her,\u201d she says. \u201cPerhaps what\u2019s happening with this new novel is that she\u2019s pulling it back in.\u201d I ask how much control Atwood likes to have. \u201cA lot\u2026\u201d Martin replies, drily, \u201calthough not consciously at all. It\u2019s necessary to control things in her world. She pays attention and is very good at understanding market forces and what people respond to.\u201d As a measure of her popularity, The Handmaid\u2019s Tale is the most borrowed adult novel from London libraries, while Waterstones reports a 160% sales increase across all Atwood titles since the title of The Testaments was revealed. By coincidence, fashion chain Whistles\u2019s autumn womenswear collection is dominated by the same navy blue and lime green colour scheme as Noma Bar\u2019s eye-popping jacket design for The Testaments. Over the coming weeks, it won\u2019t be unusual to see murals of handmaids on bookshop walls or teams of booksellers parading through city centres with placards reading \u201cNolite te bastardes carborundorum\u201d, a feminist rallying cry from the book which roughly translates as \u201cDon\u2019t let the bastards grind you down\u201d. Such is the iron-clad security around the sequel that predicting its content is a little like writing a horoscope. Atwood has dropped a few breadcrumbs here and there. \u201cEverything you\u2019ve ever asked me about Gilead and its inner workings is the inspiration for this book,\u201d she has said. \u201cWell, almost everything! The other inspiration is the world we\u2019ve been living in.\u201d \u201cAll I know is that it\u2019s three parts and [with] three different voices that are not in The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, so it\u2019s expanding it,\u201d says Martin. Whether or not that\u2019s true, the fact there are three narrators would suggest that Offred has been sidelined, perhaps in favour of the Marthas, the lower caste of women who wear green cloaks. Equally, the green of the cover could represent nature and the environment. Some Atwood fans believe the novel will focus on the climate crisis \u2013 especially its impact on women \u2013 since that is what she is preoccupied by these days. Winterson says she would be surprised if The Testaments wasn\u2019t an environmentalist story. \u201cThat\u2019s part of what The Handmaid\u2019s Tale is about,\u201d Winterson says. \u201cHow would we respond to the issue? And we probably will respond in a totalitarian way. When the first big smash hits the west, I\u2019m sure martial law will be introduced. Given that the west has moved so sharply to the right, I can\u2019t imagine it won\u2019t be an excuse for those powers to shut down all the things that have worried them so far. Just as it is at the beginning of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, when none of the women can get money out of their bank accounts any more.\u201d Novelist Naomi Alderman echoes the point. Atwood mentored Alderman for a year while she developed the concept for her bestselling novel The Power, a sci-fi story about what happens when teenage girls discover they have the power to electrocute others. The part of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale that still unnerves her most is when women are robbed of their financial independence: \u201cHow simply it happens, how easily, how convincingly. Just cut off all women\u2019s credit cards and bank cards. Just declare it illegal to employ a woman,\u201d says Alderman. \u201cIt\u2019s something that could happen to all of us, without any new technology needing to be invented. All it would take would be a bad government, a war, a stolen election. That possibility is never going away.\u201d Nevertheless, when it comes to the current gender wars, Atwood refuses to stick to a feminist script. She has faced a backlash for calling for due process for a University of British Columbia professor who was accused of sexual misconduct last year. But she has always expressed ambivalence about the feminist tag. Goodings says there is nothing \u201csloppy\u201d or \u201csentimental\u201d about her view of women: \u201cShe is so much about equality but one thing she always says is that if women are going to be equal to men, we must also see that they do bad things too. There was a school of feminism that felt sisterhood was everything and that if women ruled the world, it would be entirely different, but she doesn\u2019t have much truck with that. She\u2019s pro-women but she doesn\u2019t want to whitewash the truth.\u201d Friends point out that if you read Atwood\u2019s fiction carefully, it cuts to the heart of how cruel and corrupt women can be. In The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, we get Offred\u2019s memories of her childhood with her mother, who was a 1970s feminist. She has a phrase about how men are just God\u2019s way of making more women \u2013 and winds up burning books. Goodings says: \u201cIf you are a woman, you certainly know how horrible women can be. She faces up to it in The Robber Bride [1993]. There was a nasty woman who stole other people\u2019s husbands. You look at Cat\u2019s Eye [a novel about female bullying published in 1988], which is all about what little girls do to other little girls. When we published that, people were astonished. The reviews said it was Lord of the Flies for girls. The men I know were staggered by that book!\u201d Martin says Atwood isn\u2019t necessarily comfortable with the idea of being a famous feminist. \u201cIt\u2019s sad how some people absorb what they find in her work on such a banal level,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople who dress in costumes and go stand around the street is sad to me. When she talks about power, she\u2019s careful to make clear that the women are in power as well and what we\u2019re talking about is human tendencies, not just male and female tendencies. But obviously the condition of women historically is of interest to her.\u201d Winterson believes Atwood is a \u201cproper feminist\u201d because she has helped champion so many other women \u2013 but can understand why she has resisted the term. \u201cIt\u2019s the fear of being labelled, just as she resisted the science-fiction label and wanted to call it \u2018speculative fiction\u2019. Labels are annoying and usually they are limiting. I used to hate being called a gay writer because I knew damn well it was about patronising men trying to limit the scope of the work.\u201d \u201cNo one will influence her choices,\u201d says Karolina Sutton. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t chase trends, she\u2019s not interested in following success. If there\u2019s something that interests her about humanity she will write about it.\u201d Sutton, an agent with many big-name authors on her roster, says she has never met anyone as \u201csuperhuman\u201d as Atwood. \u201cShe\u2019s ahead of everyone in the room\u2026 she doesn\u2019t make mistakes. She\u2019ll be asked to write a 3,000-word piece about a subject that\u2019s just thrown at her \u2013 on plastics or the Russian revolution. If there\u2019s a phone at hand, she will do it.\u201d Friends say she can be very tough. \u201cI\u2019ve seen her make strong women quail,\u201d says Calder. But they all speak of her generosity. \u201cShe\u2019s big-hearted,\u201d Winterson says, \u201cand the older I get, the more important I think that is, to be big-hearted towards life and not worry too much about your own position within it.\u201d Atwood also likes a prank. Alderman says that the day after they first met, she tricked her into thinking she could speak Anglo-Saxon. \u201cIt seemed believable! Who was I to say? She got a good laugh out of that one.\u201d Atwood is reportedly in good health and has always been disciplined about her diet. Martin jokes that she is so productive \u2013 baking pies, hosting large dinners, knitting sweaters, signing books and lending support to charities and community campaigns \u2013 that she must have a secret double chained to a desk in a windowless room in Saskatchewan, maniacally typing her manuscripts. \u201cI\u2019ve spent a lot of time with her, days on end, and I never see her write!\u201d Martin laughs. \u201cI don\u2019t get when she does it! I think she\u2019s made out of space-age plastic or something.\u201d Calder, who was Atwood\u2019s UK editor in the 1980s and 90s, notes that she constantly renews her working methods. She was the first person to use the story-sharing website Wattpad; she even invented, with her stepson, a remote book-signing device called the LongPen that allows her to sign books for fans all over the world. Calder also describes how one year, Atwood decided to overhaul the process by which her books were edited, having grown fed up with responding to different editors around the world: she called a summit. \u201cWe all trooped to Toronto where she presented us each with the new manuscript which was beautifully tied up with a blue bow. We read solidly for two days without consultation and we didn\u2019t discuss it until we had to put our suggestions to her \u2013 it was immensely practical.\u201d The \u201csummits\u201d continue to this day, and often conclude with a snowy walk to her house for supper. In January, a smaller group flew to Toronto, where it was minus 20C, to discuss The Testaments. Sutton says: \u201cIt\u2019s an editorial process like no other and she makes it very special for everyone. There\u2019s always more theatre, it\u2019s more creative. But no one can dictate to Margaret Atwood! She will say: \u2018Well, everyone wants it to be a different book but it is my book and it is what it is.\u2019\u201d Atwood might joke that \u201call the books are compensation for being short\u201d but she\u2019s rarely self-deprecating. Goodings says she\u2019s not embarrassed by her power. \u201cShe wields it cleverly, I think. She\u2019s still very ambitious.\u201d Without her, the end of the world wouldn\u2019t be half so entertaining. The Testaments is published by Vintage (\u00a320).

Named O\u015bwi\u0119cim, within 10 months it would host the beginnings of the camp the world would know by its infamous German rechristening: Auschwitz. Today, on the 80th anniversary of the outbreak of the Second World War, it still prompts one of the most shaming questions of the war: why allied leaders, Winston Churchill and Franklin D Roosevelt most prominent among them, failed to prevent the mass slaughter of Europe\u2019s Jews? A pivotal moment in the development of international law and humanitarianism as a principle of diplomacy, the Holocaust, and the allies\u2019 lacklustre response to it, resonates today not simply for the facts of the worst war crime of the last century, but because of the lessons apparently unlearned, the questions unanswered. Why, from Pol Pot\u2019s killing fields to Srebrenica, Rwanda, Syria and the current persecution of China\u2019s Uighars, has the international community struggled repeatedly to construct a timely and effective response? If this inaction is difficult to contemplate today, it\u2019s because even during the years preceding the war, the Nazi persecution of Germany\u2019s Jews was both heavily prefigured and remarked on by British and US leaders, not least Roosevelt himself. Hitler\u2019s attitude towards the Jews had been explicit in Mein Kampf, a threat whose urgency was confirmed by the Nuremberg laws of 1935, excluding German Jews from Reich citizenship and prohibiting them from marriage or sexual relations with persons of \u201cGerman or related blood\u201d. By 1938, Germany\u2019s Jews were being pushed out of ownership of businesses and property and out of key professions. Indeed, such was the alarm over their treatment, in the first instance, that Britain\u2019s prime minister, Neville Chamberlain, within days of the Kristallnacht pogrom by SA troopers also in 1938, approved the Kindertransport to rescue unaccompanied German Jewish children. While a popular idea has taken root that somehow the discovery of death camps at their liberation was a surprise to an unsuspecting world, that was far from true. Even as the massacres of Jews by Nazi mobile killing squads began in summer 1941, in immediate wake of the surprise German attack on the Soviet Union, the first intimations of the Holocaust were being reported back to London and Washington by British military intelligence, by the Polish government in exile and by journalists and diplomats. On 14 August, 1941 Churchill made public fears of what was happening in areas captured by the Germans, referring in a radio broadcast to a \u201ccrime without a name\u201d to describe the slaughter of \u201cscores of thousands of civilians\u201d. So why was the issue so hard for the allies to grasp? Over the years, historians, both critical and friendly, have offered competing explanations that have run the gamut from proposing that allied war leaders struggled to understand the scale of the crime unfolding to claims that Churchill and Roosevelt were simply indifferent. Others have pointed to the practical difficulties of intervention in the midst of total war, including the range of allied bombers, the diversion of resources required, and the view in allied governments that defeating the Axis powers was the best way to secure the safety of Europe\u2019s threatened civilians, including its Jews. By the end of 1942, however, there was little doubt what was happening. On 13 December 1942, the celebrated US journalist Ed Murrow gave Churchill\u2019s \u201ccrime without a name\u201d a clear framing in a radio broadcast. \u201cMillions of human beings, most of them Jews, are being gathered up with ruthless efficiency and murdered,\u201d he said. \u201cThe phrase \u2018concentration camps\u2019 is obsolete\u2026 it is now possible only to speak of extermination camps.\u201d And as the author Dan Plesch \u2013 who has spent recent years studying forgotten and suppressed archives relating to the allied response to the Holocaust \u2013 points out, allied leaders were aware of the vast scale of the crime the Nazis were engaged in. In a joint statement which would be read to a silent House of Commons four days after Murrow\u2019s broadcast by foreign secretary, Anthony Eden, allied governments revealed the ongoing Nazi effort to systematically transport and \u201cexterminate\u201d Europe\u2019s Jews, naming Poland as the \u201cprincipal slaughterhouse\u201d and threatening to hold German leaders to account.

On the British side, Viscount Cranborne, one of Churchill\u2019s ministers, felt able to tell his fellow lords he did not believe that Jews should be considered a special case and that the British empire was already too full of refugees to offer a safe haven. Cranborne was not alone. Even as late as August 1944, senior Foreign Office officials were still urging scepticism over stories of atrocities that came from \u201cJewish sources\u201d. On the US side, a similar story played out amid a toxic atmosphere towards immigration, not least European Jewish immigration, which began in the 1930s and that informed Roosevelt\u2019s public caution on the issue, not least when confronted by a Congress hostile to his stance on the threat from Nazi Germany.

A former senior Metropolitan police officer, former Chief Superintendent Dal Babu, also said the episode should be subject to urgent twin investigations by the cabinet secretary, Mark Sedwill, and Scotland Yard. The demands for inquiries into the sacking last Thursday of Sonia Khan, the 27-year-old Treasury special adviser, came amid heightened tension at Westminster over Johnson\u2019s decision to suspend parliament for five weeks. The suspension, planned by Cummings for several weeks, was partly designed to limit the time MPs will have to block a no-deal Brexit. Saturday\u2019s demonstrations against the shutting down of parliament featured protesters across the country chanting \u201cstop the coup\u201d and \u201csave our democracy\u201d. Cummings is understood to have concluded that Khan had been dishonest about her recent contacts with her ex-boss, the anti-no deal former chancellor Philip Hammond, and one of his ex-aides \u2013 accusations that Khan strongly denies. Having summoned her to No 10 on Thursday evening to question her, Cummings took her two phones, one used for private calls and one for work, and fired her after seeing she had talked to an ex-aide to Hammond last week. Cummings then went outside No 10 and asked an armed officer to enter the building and escort Khan off the premises. Friends of Khan said she was deeply upset by the episode and was considering what action to take next. They accused Cummings of establishing a \u201creign of terror\u201d at the heart of government.

In the period before the great trilogy of <em>Figaro</em>, <em>Don Giovanni</em> and <em>Cos\u00ed</em>, Mozart became stuck on several projects that remained unfinished but contain some superb surviving music. His incomplete operas <em>L\u2019oca del Cairo</em> and <em>Lo sposo deluso</em> have now been woven into a sort of postmodern tapestry in three scenes by the ingenious Rapha\u00ebl Pichon with his ensemble <a href=\"https://www.ensemblepygmalion.com/accueil-en\" title=\"\">Pygmalion</a> on <a href=\"https://www.prestomusic.com/classical/products/8652605--liberta\" title=\"\"><strong>Libert\u00e0!</strong></a> (Harmonia Mundi). Magpie-like, Pichon also draws on Mozart\u2019s contemporaries in Vienna, Paisiello, Mart\u00edn y Soler (the piece that\u2019s quoted in Don Giovanni\u2019s final supper) and Salieri (a comic ensemble that\u2019s a winner). Each tableau starts with a strong overture, the last being a fizzing account of <em>Der Schauspieldirektor</em>, and two finish with calm nocturnes.

      "bodyText": "\u2022 Even great composers go through tricky patches. In the period before the great trilogy of Figaro, Don Giovanni and Cos\u00ed, Mozart became stuck on several projects that remained unfinished but contain some superb surviving music. His incomplete operas L\u2019oca del Cairo and Lo sposo deluso have now been woven into a sort of postmodern tapestry in three scenes by the ingenious Rapha\u00ebl Pichon with his ensemble Pygmalion on Libert\u00e0! (Harmonia Mundi). Magpie-like, Pichon also draws on Mozart\u2019s contemporaries in Vienna, Paisiello, Mart\u00edn y Soler (the piece that\u2019s quoted in Don Giovanni\u2019s final supper) and Salieri (a comic ensemble that\u2019s a winner). Each tableau starts with a strong overture, the last being a fizzing account of Der Schauspieldirektor, and two finish with calm nocturnes. There\u2019s room for concert arias at which the French soprano Sabine Devieilhe excels, arrangements of domestic canons, and while the logic of the whole may not be purist, it\u2019s totally ingenious and brilliantly delivered. \u2022 The present generation of countertenors is outstanding, and on a new collection called Elegy (Vivat), Iestyn Davies and newcomer James Hall partner in famous duets by Purcell and John Blow.

      "body": "<p>At the end of the second world war there was no guarantee that it would not be followed swiftly by a third. Six years of the most intensely murderous and geographically spread conflict in the history of the human species had left unprecedented devastation. From Normandy to Ukraine, vast areas of Europe had been pulverised by aerial bombing and ravaged by savage ground fighting. The landscape was a ruination of flattened homes, wrecked factories and fallow farms.</p> <p>Great swathes of Asia, especially China, had suffered appallingly. Up to 85 million souls had lost their lives; more millions had been displaced. France and Italy appeared to be on the brink of revolution. Japan\u2019s militarists had been answered with atomic attack and fire bombing by the US. A devastated Germany was starving. The UK had introduced bread rationing, a privation it had managed to avoid during the tribulations of the war. The emergent global superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union, started to glower at each other across a Europe divided by an iron curtain. The guns of one conflict had barely fallen silent before peoples and their leaders were trembling in anticipation of another.</p> <p>Yet from the ashes of this terrible legacy was born a new world which would come to enjoy prosperity and peace of a kind not seen before. There would be many more wars after 1945, and some of them would be nasty, brutish and long. The superpower struggle for dominance expressed itself through proxy conflicts in Korea, Vietnam and the Middle East, in dirty wars in South and Central America, and in vicious conflicts in Africa. What there was not again was an all-consuming conflagration between major powers. The total war of 1939-45 was the midwife to a kind of peace.</p> <p>Some of this is explained by the fear that a third world war would be a last world war. Direct conflict between the US and the USSR threatened to be terminal for humanity once America was deprived of its nuclear monopoly in 1949 and each superpower assembled an arsenal capable of annihilating the planet several times over. They came nerve-shreddingly close to Armageddon on occasion, notably during the Cuban missile crisis in 1962, but the spectre of mutually assured destruction, pithily acronymised as \u201cM.A.D\u201d, deterred them from going over the brink.</p> <p>There was much more to it than the balance of terror between the superpowers. The world built after 1945 was the result of an exceptionally visionary and creative period of statecraft by a generation of western politicians who had witnessed the catastrophic consequences of the 1930s. Extreme nationalism, ruinously protectionist economic policies and international anarchy had led to the world\u2019s greatest bloodletting.</p> <p>The western victors responded by striving to create a new world imbued with liberal values and anchored in effective international institutions. At the forefront was the United States. Between 1939 and 1945, the US had more than doubled the size of its economy, becoming the greatest industrial power in world history. America was the only major power to become richer, very much richer, rather than poorer because of the war. When they might have rested on this superiority, America\u2019s postwar leadership determined to try to learn from the follies which had led to 1939. In contrast to the aftermath of the first world war, when the US beat a fatal retreat into isolationism, the most influential figures in America\u2019s political class decided that it was now imperative to be fully engaged. Americans still put America\u2019s priorities at the forefront of their calculations, but by historical standards they were remarkably forward-thinking victors. <br>General George Marshall, wartime hero and former army chief of staff, became US secretary of state and the leading author of a \u201cEuropean Recovery Program\u201d. Returning from a visit to Moscow, he had seen the desolation in Europe first-hand. In a radio broadcast in April 1947 which paved the way towards what would become known as the Marshall plan, he warned: \u201cThe recovery of Europe has been far slower than had been expected.

      "bodyText": "At the end of the second world war there was no guarantee that it would not be followed swiftly by a third. Six years of the most intensely murderous and geographically spread conflict in the history of the human species had left unprecedented devastation. From Normandy to Ukraine, vast areas of Europe had been pulverised by aerial bombing and ravaged by savage ground fighting. The landscape was a ruination of flattened homes, wrecked factories and fallow farms. Great swathes of Asia, especially China, had suffered appallingly. Up to 85 million souls had lost their lives; more millions had been displaced. France and Italy appeared to be on the brink of revolution. Japan\u2019s militarists had been answered with atomic attack and fire bombing by the US. A devastated Germany was starving. The UK had introduced bread rationing, a privation it had managed to avoid during the tribulations of the war. The emergent global superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union, started to glower at each other across a Europe divided by an iron curtain. The guns of one conflict had barely fallen silent before peoples and their leaders were trembling in anticipation of another. Yet from the ashes of this terrible legacy was born a new world which would come to enjoy prosperity and peace of a kind not seen before. There would be many more wars after 1945, and some of them would be nasty, brutish and long. The superpower struggle for dominance expressed itself through proxy conflicts in Korea, Vietnam and the Middle East, in dirty wars in South and Central America, and in vicious conflicts in Africa. What there was not again was an all-consuming conflagration between major powers. The total war of 1939-45 was the midwife to a kind of peace. Some of this is explained by the fear that a third world war would be a last world war. Direct conflict between the US and the USSR threatened to be terminal for humanity once America was deprived of its nuclear monopoly in 1949 and each superpower assembled an arsenal capable of annihilating the planet several times over. They came nerve-shreddingly close to Armageddon on occasion, notably during the Cuban missile crisis in 1962, but the spectre of mutually assured destruction, pithily acronymised as \u201cM.A.D\u201d, deterred them from going over the brink. There was much more to it than the balance of terror between the superpowers. The world built after 1945 was the result of an exceptionally visionary and creative period of statecraft by a generation of western politicians who had witnessed the catastrophic consequences of the 1930s. Extreme nationalism, ruinously protectionist economic policies and international anarchy had led to the world\u2019s greatest bloodletting. The western victors responded by striving to create a new world imbued with liberal values and anchored in effective international institutions. At the forefront was the United States. Between 1939 and 1945, the US had more than doubled the size of its economy, becoming the greatest industrial power in world history. America was the only major power to become richer, very much richer, rather than poorer because of the war. When they might have rested on this superiority, America\u2019s postwar leadership determined to try to learn from the follies which had led to 1939. In contrast to the aftermath of the first world war, when the US beat a fatal retreat into isolationism, the most influential figures in America\u2019s political class decided that it was now imperative to be fully engaged. Americans still put America\u2019s priorities at the forefront of their calculations, but by historical standards they were remarkably forward-thinking victors. General George Marshall, wartime hero and former army chief of staff, became US secretary of state and the leading author of a \u201cEuropean Recovery Program\u201d. Returning from a visit to Moscow, he had seen the desolation in Europe first-hand. In a radio broadcast in April 1947 which paved the way towards what would become known as the Marshall plan, he warned: \u201cThe recovery of Europe has been far slower than had been expected. The patient is sinking while the doctors deliberate.\u201d Billions of US dollars was poured into the reconstruction of Europe, including Germany and Italy. Never before had a military victor treated the conquered with such generosity. Only a fifth of the aid came in the form of loans. The rest was in grants to minimise the future financial burden on Europe. Ernest Bevin, the British foreign secretary, later described it as \u201ca lifeline to sinking men\u201d. There was nothing inevitable about this. Republicans in the US Congress balked at pumping so many tax dollars into the rescue of Europe. Stalin forbade Soviet-dominated states in eastern Europe from taking the aid and the Kremlin incited communists in western Europe to agitate against the Marshall programme on the grounds that it was a form of American imperialism.

Fascism was the trouble \u2013 fascism in a time when the liberal democracies were too weak to resist it or to defend the Versailles status quo. France and Britain were never, until the very end, quite able to grasp that the dictators were not rational, that deterrents did not deter them and that a diplomacy which offered concessions seemed to them an admission of weakness.</p> <p>AJP Taylor, a historian who liked upsetting received ideas, wrote that Hitler never had a coherent plan of conquest but simply grabbed opportunities. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/neville-chamberlain\" title=\"\">Neville Chamberlain</a>, who became British prime minister in 1937, did have a plan for dealing with Hitler, \u201cdeterrence with negotiation from strength\u201d.

He didn\u2019t want Hitler to feel \u201csurrounded\u201d. (And much of the Conservative party, while disliking both tyrannies, instinctively preferred the Nazis to the Bolsheviks.) It wouldn\u2019t have worked, anyway. Even if Stalin had honoured an agreement, the Polish government would never have joined a military pact with the traditional Russian enemy. And when Chamberlain changed his mind, it was too late.

Germany was escalating demands for Polish territory and the \u201cfree city\u201d of Danzig. On 30 March 1939, Britain and a reluctant France issued a guarantee of Polish independence. Soon afterwards, the guarantee was extended to Romania and Greece. Most of Europe knew this would not stop Hitler and that war was imminent. Strangely, Chamberlain didn\u2019t. He thought the guarantee would put Hitler off, and horrified the House of Commons by suggesting that the promise only protected Poland\u2019s independence \u2013 not its territorial integrity.</p> <p>The invasion of Poland began on 1 September 1939. Britain and France declared war two days later. Hitler had never believed that the British would fight.

In contrast to the patriotic fervour of 1914, the German people went into this conflict full of gloom and foreboding, a mood which only cleared after the dazzling victory over France in 1940. The British did not cheer either. A few years earlier, prime minister Stanley Baldwin had told them that \u201cthe bomber will always get through\u2026 when the next war comes and European civilisation is wiped out\u2026\u201d</p> <p>So began the 21 months of European war \u2013 not yet world war. The Poles fought bravely but were crushed by Nazi and Soviet armies advancing from west and east. The USSR invaded Finland. Britain and France did nothing militarily to fulfil their guarantees to Poland, and spent a static winter confronting the Germans across the French frontier. Could this war \u2013 should it \u2013 have been avoided?</p> <p>Hitler would almost certainly have attacked France sooner or later. But Britain? To this day, a few historians think that the Polish guarantee was a fateful mistake. In this view, Chamberlain\u2019s previous policies offered the only hope of avoiding war, saving the British empire and perhaps preventing the postwar world\u2019s domination by only two superpowers.</p> <p>In April 1940, Germany invaded Denmark and Norway. In May, Hitler launched the tremendous offensive which overran Holland, Belgium and France, and threw the small British army out of Europe at Dunkirk. The Battle of Britain denied Hitler the air superiority he needed to cross the Channel, but Benito Mussolini now thought it safe to bring Italy into the war and occupy a sliver of France.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"871d3351ac7b1c665d8d00f5bdc329b12442dc8c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/871d3351ac7b1c665d8d00f5bdc329b12442dc8c/0_170_3677_2207/1000.jpg\" alt=\"German troops march into Prague\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">German troops march into Prague during the invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1939.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Three Lions/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hitler had in fact won the war by the late summer of 1940. Britain, he thought, could now be bracketed out. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/winston-churchill\" title=\"\">Winston Churchill</a> made brave speeches, but Britain was isolated and some members of Churchill\u2019s cabinet were quietly angling for a \u201ccommonsense\u201d deal with Germany to end hostilities. Hitler had conquered seven countries with a population of more than 100 million, from the Arctic to the Mediterranean, from the Atlantic almost to the Black Sea. The rest of \u201cneutral\u201d Europe cowered. The Soviet Union and the US showed no immediate sign of wishing to join the conflict. Why, then, was this not the end of the story?</p> <h2>***</h2> <p>It was time for my father to leave for work at the torpedo factory. But he suddenly jumped up from the breakfast table and went to the window to stare at the morning sky. I can still hear the exultation in his voice. \u201cNow I know we are going to win the war!\u201d</p> <p>The wireless had just told us that Nazi Germany had invaded the Soviet Union. It was 22 June 1941. It was the day when an Anglo-German war began to turn into a world war. It was the day when Hitler set in train his own failure and death and the destruction of his country. And it was the day that designed the postwar world. </p> <p>In the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/cold-war\" title=\"\">cold </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/cold-war\" title=\"\">war</a> years, the mighty Sebastian Haffner of the<em> Observer </em>used to say: \u201cWe are living in Hitler\u2019s Europe.\u201d He meant that on that June morning, Hitler had made three things inevitable. The first was his own defeat; in the long run, no invader could overcome the colossal resources of Russia and the courage of its peoples. The second was that Germany would not only be devastated but would be broken up into satellite states shaped by the victors. The third was that Russian power would surge forward right into the centre of Europe \u2013 something western statesmen had struggled to prevent for two centuries. There the Soviet armies would meet Anglo-American armies entering Germany from the west, a confrontation which would lead to the permanent division of our continent into two hostile camps \u2013 the cold war. We were to live in \u201cHitler\u2019s Europe\u201d until 1989 (with the collapse of the Berlin Wall).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"8b39b7f8359a7c4223feae21ea5315749707d999\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8b39b7f8359a7c4223feae21ea5315749707d999/0_101_2080_2598/801.jpg\" alt=\"Women\u2019s Auxiliary Army\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An ambulance driver of the British Women\u2019s Auxiliary Army in 1940.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hulton Archive/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By the summer of 1941, in any case, the war was starting to spread beyond Europe. China\u2019s long war against Japanese imperialism was still a separate affair, but north Africa had become a battlefield as the Italians, and then the German Afrika-Korps attempted to drive the British out of Egypt. The British pushed Italy out of Abyssinia and Eritrea, and suppressed a pro-German rising in Iraq. And under the Royal Navy\u2019s protection, troops and equipment from India and colonial Africa were pouring into north Africa and Britain itself.</p> <h2>***</h2> <p>Late in 1941, two almost insane decisions completed the transformation into a true world war. On 7 December Japanese aircraft attacked the American fleet at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. In doing so, they challenged the Pacific\u2019s superpower to battle just as they were engaged in a gigantic offensive to conquer the French, British and Dutch empires in south-east Asia \u2013 a gamble that succeeded at first but ultimately turned out to be far beyond Japan\u2019s resources.</p> <p>A few days later, Hitler inexplicably declared war on the US. There was no sober reason for it, beyond showing solidarity with Japan. It\u2019s hard to remember now how little Europeans (and Americans) knew about foreign countries in those days. Hitler genuinely believed that the US was a nation of pampered cowards, \u201chalf Judaized, half negrified\u201d, unable to produce real soldiers.</p> <p>President Roosevelt had been arming and supplying Britain for more than a year. But now America joined Britain and the Soviet Union as a full member of the military alliance dedicated to the defeat and \u201cunconditional surrender\u201d of Germany and Japan, as well as Italy. Troops, aircraft and supplies flowed into Britain; American equipment reached Russia on perilous Arctic convoys. Almost at once, the Americans began to urge Churchill to launch an invasion of Nazi-held France, to relieve the pressure on the Soviet Union. Stalin joined the chorus for a second front in 1942.</p> <p>Churchill refused. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/second-world-war-archive-coverage-1945\" title=\"\">Years more preparation were needed</a> if a cross-Channel invasion were not to fail. Meanwhile, 1942 was a grim time for Britain as Japan collapsed the British empire in south-east Asia, conquering Malaya and Singapore and marching through Burma towards India. But it was on the eastern front, in the Soviet Union, that the outcome of the war was decided. Hitler had invaded Yugoslavia and then Greece, critically reducing the strength he needed in Russia, and on 8 December 1941 \u2013 the day after Pearl Harbor \u2013 the Nazi advance was finally halted in the snow a few miles before Moscow.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6601a343036b247a5f52dc1d39800cbeb8cd184b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6601a343036b247a5f52dc1d39800cbeb8cd184b/0_162_2552_1531/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Singapore falls in 1942\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">British, Australian, and Indian troops surrender to the Japanese as Singapore falls in 1942.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Popperfoto/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But it was not until early 1943 that the tide of this colossal struggle began to turn, as the German 6th Army, cut off at Stalingrad, was forced to surrender after losing 140,000 dead. The decisive battle began in July at Kursk, the biggest tank battle in history, as the Red Army (well warned by spies) attacked the flanks of a huge Nazi thrust. Two million men and nearly 6,000 tanks took part. After Kursk, the Soviets began an inexorable advance which would bring them, two years later, to Berlin.</p> <p>Elsewhere, the anti-Axis coalition was at last winning campaigns and liberating territory. The Americans landed in Algeria and, with the British driving victoriously across Libya, threw the Germans out of north Africa. Soon the Allies had taken Sicily and \u2013 as Italy dropped out of the war \u2013 American, British, Polish, French and New Zealand troops were fighting their way up the Italian peninsula.</p> <p>Stalin dominated the Teheran conference of the \u201cbig three\u201d, held at the end of 1943. The Red Army was carrying the main burden of the war in Europe. Churchill had not yet launched the promised cross-Channel invasion, and the strength of the US war economy was only beginning to show as Japanese and American air and naval power clashed in the Pacific. President Roosevelt did not press Stalin about his plans for \u201cliberated\u201d Europe. Instead, he welcomed Soviet support for a \u201cunited nations organisation\u201d after the war, and Stalin\u2019s promise to attack Japan.</p> <h2>***</h2> <p>In June 1944, the Allies finally stormed the Normandy beaches. After months of fierce fighting, the Germans retreated and by the end of the year France, Belgium and most of Holland had been liberated. The invasion was coordinated with another huge Soviet offensive, which broke through and drove on to the outskirts of Warsaw. The city rose to free itself before it fell under Soviet control, but the Red Army halted and allowed the Germans to suppress the rising and massacre the population.</p> <p>By the summer of 1944, it was obvious that Germany had lost the war which it had won in 1940. But it dragged on for another nine months. Armies fought their way into the Reich from east and west; German cities crumpled under the obliterating firestorms of Allied bombing; Germany\u2019s children died clutching anti-tank grenades while their mothers and sisters were raped by the invaders. Why?</p> <p>There were four main reasons why the Reich fought on. The first was the Allies\u2019 insistence on \u201cunconditional surrender\u201d \u2013 no negotiated peace. The second was the incredible resilience of German soldiers, who never seemed to lose their power of instant counterattack. The third was the hypnotic grip of Adolf Hitler\u2019s personal cult, decaying into a belief that loyalty to somebody, to anybody or anything, was the last lifebelt in an ocean of meaningless horror.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"53eef189d7b67765d9df31e3f0951dc3ed0b1f0a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/53eef189d7b67765d9df31e3f0951dc3ed0b1f0a/0_275_4961_2977/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Adolf Hitler\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The young fighters of the Hitler Youth were caught in Hitler\u2019s hypnotic grip.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ullstein bild Dtl./Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The fourth reason was that many Germans, not only leading Nazis, knew what had been done in their name. From the Russians, at least, they expected no mercy. But, strangely, efforts to conceal evidence of the greatest crime of all, the murder of six million Jews, were late and erratic. In that summer of 1944, the Auschwitz gas chambers were still killing 10,000 Hungarian Jews a day (the last death train reached Auschwitz at the end of October).</p> <h2>***</h2> <p>On 29 April 1945, as Russian troops closed in on his Berlin bunker, Hitler killed himself. On 7 May, after a messy series of local surrenders, Germany finally stopped fighting. Two historic conferences between the victorious Allies, Yalta that February and Potsdam in July, confirmed the future outlines of \u201cHitler\u2019s Europe\u201d, a cold war continent divided between two hostile military pacts, with a few nervous neutrals on the fringes.</p> <p>At Yalta, Roosevelt and Churchill accepted that the half of Europe already \u201cliberated\u201d by Soviet forces would remain a Soviet zone of influence. Its countries became Moscow\u2019s puppets for the next 44 years, suffering decades of police terror, censorship and privation. The fate of Poland, which had suffered atrociously under Nazi occupation while staying loyal to the Allies from the first day of the war to the last, was especially agonising. To this day, Poles consider that the west sold them out at Yalta. But by then, only a third world war might have pushed Soviet power back to its own frontiers.</p> <p>The second world war had only one unqualified winner: the US. Defeating Japan, expected to take several more years and cost a million casualties, was achieved on two days that August, as atomic bombs incinerated Hiroshima and Nagasaki together with their inhabitants. America emerged as by far the greatest industrial power on earth, supplying almost insatiable demand from its own internal market and from the reconstruction of a ruined western Europe \u2013 given hard-currency purchasing power through the Marshall Plan. There followed the \u201cAmerican half-century\u201d, in which the US\u2019s hegemony \u2013 economic, cultural and military \u2013 controlled most of the non-communist world.</p> <p>The first world war had destroyed the old land empires of Eurasia by military defeat and revolution. The second world war led to the slow foundering of Europe\u2019s colonial empires \u2013 British, French, Dutch, Belgian and Portuguese. Military experience, spreading education, the ideals of the Russian Revolution, even the sudden leap in earnings caused by wartime demand for African and Asian raw materials, all encouraged colonised peoples to demand independence. It was won sometimes by negotiation, sometimes by bloody and prolonged \u201cliberation struggles\u201d.</p> <p>The world atlas changed colour. So did the streets of western Europe. Old imperial states, traditionally identified as white and Christian, now began to receive a massive inflow of immigrants, at first from north Africa and the Caribbean, later broadening to draw in settlers from south Asia and tropical Africa.</p> <p>These migrations followed the colossal population movements within Europe as the war ended. Millions took to the roads home as the Reich\u2019s forced labourers escaped and the gates of the concentration camps fell open. Ethnic cleansing on an unimaginable scale drove some 12 million Germans from their homes in eastern and central Europe. Polish families uprooted from their villages in Belarus or Ukraine moved into renamed German cities whose inhabitants in turn had been expelled. Far to the east, Stalin deported Chechens, Tatars and Greeks to starve in central Asian deserts.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f62447426cc2b05e745f7a695ec5e63259aed38e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f62447426cc2b05e745f7a695ec5e63259aed38e/0_659_1981_1188/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bergen-Belsen concentration camp\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in May 1945.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: George Rodger/Life/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In those six years of war, the world had shrunk. Continents got to know one another. Rural English girls goggled at black American soldiers, then adored their courtesy and their dance steps. In Nazi Berlin, teenagers listened to Dizzy Gillespie on American Forces Network, growing clearer as the tanks drew nearer. At my school, we lay in the grass \u2013 the turf trembling in the thunder from five miles above us, as hundreds of silvery Liberators passed in formation to bomb France \u2013 and we said: \u201cMaybe everybody will fly everywhere after the war. Maybe we\u2019ll go to Alaska and meet Eskimos, and then Africa and meet real Zulus.\u201d</p> <p>Europe seemed a dark place, where the Germans crouched and horrible stuff happened. But one day the headmaster gathered us to hear a poem written \u201cover there\u201d and somehow smuggled across the Channel by the Resistance. It was by Paul \u00c9luard: <em>\u201cI was born to know you, / To utter your name / Libert\u00e9.\u201d</em></p> <p>Resistance, its memory and myth, restored to Europeans a scrap of dignity under Nazi occupation and afterwards. Except in Poland and above all in Yugoslavia, its military impact was minor. But <em>libert\u00e9</em> came to mean more than chasing out the Germans. It meant change. Europe experienced a \u201cresistance moment\u201d from about 1943 to the start of the cold war in 1947, in which men and women emerged from clandestinity to demand and plan radical national renewal. Their prewar governments, they believed, had surrendered to fascism because they were corrupt, grossly unequal, lacking moral legitimacy. Now socialist and communist ex-partisans, many of them survivors of Gestapo torture, dominated many of the first post-liberation governments. But it was not long before growing cold war paranoia, Stalinist or anti-communist, broke their alliance apart.</p> <p>Resisters were usually a tiny minority. Most people in Nazi-occupied Europe had spent hungry, humiliating years keeping their heads down. Only afterwards did they recover self-respect by identifying with the patriotic sacrifice of the few. It took a generation before France could admit that \u2013 for example \u2013 French officials had arranged the transport of 4,500 Jewish children to be gassed and burned in the Nazi death camps.</p> <p>The ruins left by the war were moral as well as physical. Our Europe is built on them. The dream of a united Europe started as a plan to rebuild the integrity and authority of its disgraced nation states, something which those states were still too weak to manage by themselves. The vision of a supranational union without internal frontiers, making future wars unthinkable, was secondary. Later, Charles de Gaulle was to talk of a <em>Europe des patrie</em><em>s</em>, rather than a United States of Europe. He is still right.</p> <p>The \u201cresistance moment\u201d led into the <em>Trente Glorieuses</em> \u2013 the 30 years in which the peoples of western Europe mended their wreckage and became more prosperous, more secure, more equal and better educated than ever before \u2013 or since. Britain, too, had used the war years to plan the great postwar settlement which seemed \u2013 for a time \u2013 to be consigning poverty, gross wealth and health differences, inflation and \u201cbankers\u2019 economics\u201d to history. People looked back at the war and the 1930s, and said: \u201cNever again!\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The ruins left by the war were moral as well as physical. Our Europe is built on them</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>And yet Britain was turning in on itself as the war ended. \u201cWe stood alone against Hitler.\u201d But Britain was actually more isolated in the postwar decades than in 1940. Back then \u2013 for all its marvellous defiance after Dunkirk \u2013 Britain was supported by the armed forces of the Commonwealth and the resources of the empire, to say nothing of American aid.</p> <p>Myths about wartime soon took hold. Hadn\u2019t Britain triumphed by just being itself \u2013 by being the comically amateurish, strangulated and yet quietly heroic England of the conservative vision? Films made in wartime starred soldier-characters who often didn\u2019t talk posh. But in the war movies of the 1950s and 1960s, the heroes were usually officers with public school accents.</p> <p>Perhaps, too, things seen or experienced in that war left the British with a special trauma, a revulsion against the outside world. When British troops entered the vast concentration camp at Bergen-Belsen, a decision was taken to bring as many soldiers as possible \u2013 young officers especially \u2013 to see it. I came to know quite a few of them later.</p> <p>All were deeply damaged. They had known about Nazi brutality, of course, but this\u2026 it was beyond just \u201cthe Germans\u201d. They had no idea that human beings of any description were capable of this. French, Polish, Dutch witnesses did have at least an idea. But these officers were damaged not only in their English innocence but in their own sense of humanity. If Europe was a place where such things were imaginable, how intimate with Europe could one become?</p> <h2>***</h2> <p>Sometimes the cruelty of war shows more clearly in small, quiet scenes than in battles and bombings.</p> <p>When I think of the second world war, I see the platform of an English railway station, in the bitter cold of a wartime night. A train is waiting, a wisp of white steam flickering in the lamplight. My mother and I have brought P and her fiance to the station. He is returning to his submarine. The odds on him and his crew surviving are not good.</p> <p>We sit on a bench outside the ticket office, while P \u2013 smiling hard \u2013 walks with her man to the end of the platform. Nobody else is about. We can just see them as he leans out of the window of the compartment, their heads close together. Then the engine whistles, the train begins to move. P stands still, as the carriages and finally the red tail-light on the guard\u2019s van slowly pass her and vanish into the night.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2ab5e27069ebe7aafe3d00a3d41468f979398e7f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2ab5e27069ebe7aafe3d00a3d41468f979398e7f/0_49_2602_3251/800.jpg\" alt=\"A sailor kisses his sweetheart\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A sailor kisses his sweetheart goodbye at a railway station.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: George W Hales/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Alone, she starts back towards us, very upright and brisk-stepping. My mother, a naval wife who knows about farewells, opens her bag and takes out two large, clean white handkerchiefs. She stands up.</p> <p>P has come quite close to us when I see her knees begin to buckle. My mother moves swiftly to catch her as she falls and guide her to the bench.</p> <p>I walk away for a while, so I don\u2019t hear or see. I\u2019m a wartime child, so I too know this routine. Wartime, peacetime, like winter and summer, the natural alternation. It\u2019s a cruel moment, and I have learned that war is cruel. But nobody has taught me yet that war doesn\u2019t have to happen.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2019/sep/01/second-world-war-united-nations-nato\">Brave new world: Andrew Rawnsley on the search for peace and prosperity</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "The Soviet writer Ilya Ehrenburg once wrote that war comes very early to the theatre. He stands around for a long time in the wings, waiting for his performance to begin. Nearly a century later, it\u2019s generally assumed that the second world war was inevitable. Was it? In contrast to all the intriguing arguments about the origins of the first \u201cGreat War\u201d, most people accept that this war was long foreseen and that its cause can be reduced to a single word: Hitler. That consensus is too comfortable not to be challenged. The historian Eric Hobsbawm wrote that \u201cwe who lived through those times knew that there would be a war, even as we sketched out unconvincing scenarios for avoiding it\u201d. Many have blamed the Versailles peace treaties of 1919 for designing a Europe of unsatisfied nationalisms to which Hitler merely put the torch. Will Dyson\u2019s 1919 drawing \u201cPeace and Future Cannon Fodder\u201d is the most dreadfully prophetic of all political cartoons. The Big Four world statesmen are emerging from Versailles, past a naked toddler labelled \u201c1940 Class\u201d, and French prime minister Georges Cl\u00e9menceau is saying: \u201cCurious! I seem to hear a child weeping.\u201d But the Versailles settlement might not have ended in catastrophe, even though it made some sort of resentful German revival inevitable. Fascism was the trouble \u2013 fascism in a time when the liberal democracies were too weak to resist it or to defend the Versailles status quo. France and Britain were never, until the very end, quite able to grasp that the dictators were not rational, that deterrents did not deter them and that a diplomacy which offered concessions seemed to them an admission of weakness. AJP Taylor, a historian who liked upsetting received ideas, wrote that Hitler never had a coherent plan of conquest but simply grabbed opportunities. Neville Chamberlain, who became British prime minister in 1937, did have a plan for dealing with Hitler, \u201cdeterrence with negotiation from strength\u201d. But how do you negotiate with somebody completely unreliable and capricious? Until 1939, Chamberlain resisted the idea of an anti-German alliance which would include the Soviet Union. He didn\u2019t want Hitler to feel \u201csurrounded\u201d. (And much of the Conservative party, while disliking both tyrannies, instinctively preferred the Nazis to the Bolsheviks.) It wouldn\u2019t have worked, anyway. Even if Stalin had honoured an agreement, the Polish government would never have joined a military pact with the traditional Russian enemy. And when Chamberlain changed his mind, it was too late. In August 1939, Nazi Germany and the USSR signed their infamous non-aggression pact which secretly agreed on the partition of Poland and the abolition of the Baltic states. The year before, a complacent Chamberlain had \u201csaved the peace\u201d at Munich, by forcing the Czechoslovak government to surrender the Sudeten territory to Germany. \u201cHitler has missed the bus,\u201d he told his cabinet. But in March 1939 Hitler tore up the agreement and invaded the Czech lands, reducing them to a German \u201cprotectorate\u201d. Chamberlain was shattered. But ever since Munich, British opinion had been swinging round from \u201cappeasement\u201d to a sombre recognition that the country must now prepare for war. The war broke out because, unexpectedly, Britain did something reckless. Germany was escalating demands for Polish territory and the \u201cfree city\u201d of Danzig. On 30 March 1939, Britain and a reluctant France issued a guarantee of Polish independence. Soon afterwards, the guarantee was extended to Romania and Greece. Most of Europe knew this would not stop Hitler and that war was imminent. Strangely, Chamberlain didn\u2019t. He thought the guarantee would put Hitler off, and horrified the House of Commons by suggesting that the promise only protected Poland\u2019s independence \u2013 not its territorial integrity. The invasion of Poland began on 1 September 1939. Britain and France declared war two days later. Hitler had never believed that the British would fight. He had always intended to have a war \u2013 Poland, France, Russia eventually \u2013 but not this one. In contrast to the patriotic fervour of 1914, the German people went into this conflict full of gloom and foreboding, a mood which only cleared after the dazzling victory over France in 1940. The British did not cheer either. A few years earlier, prime minister Stanley Baldwin had told them that \u201cthe bomber will always get through\u2026 when the next war comes and European civilisation is wiped out\u2026\u201d So began the 21 months of European war \u2013 not yet world war. The Poles fought bravely but were crushed by Nazi and Soviet armies advancing from west and east. The USSR invaded Finland. Britain and France did nothing militarily to fulfil their guarantees to Poland, and spent a static winter confronting the Germans across the French frontier. Could this war \u2013 should it \u2013 have been avoided? Hitler would almost certainly have attacked France sooner or later. But Britain? To this day, a few historians think that the Polish guarantee was a fateful mistake. In this view, Chamberlain\u2019s previous policies offered the only hope of avoiding war, saving the British empire and perhaps preventing the postwar world\u2019s domination by only two superpowers. In April 1940, Germany invaded Denmark and Norway. In May, Hitler launched the tremendous offensive which overran Holland, Belgium and France, and threw the small British army out of Europe at Dunkirk. The Battle of Britain denied Hitler the air superiority he needed to cross the Channel, but Benito Mussolini now thought it safe to bring Italy into the war and occupy a sliver of France. Hitler had in fact won the war by the late summer of 1940. Britain, he thought, could now be bracketed out. Winston Churchill made brave speeches, but Britain was isolated and some members of Churchill\u2019s cabinet were quietly angling for a \u201ccommonsense\u201d deal with Germany to end hostilities. Hitler had conquered seven countries with a population of more than 100 million, from the Arctic to the Mediterranean, from the Atlantic almost to the Black Sea. The rest of \u201cneutral\u201d Europe cowered. The Soviet Union and the US showed no immediate sign of wishing to join the conflict. Why, then, was this not the end of the story? *** It was time for my father to leave for work at the torpedo factory. But he suddenly jumped up from the breakfast table and went to the window to stare at the morning sky. I can still hear the exultation in his voice. \u201cNow I know we are going to win the war!\u201d The wireless had just told us that Nazi Germany had invaded the Soviet Union. It was 22 June 1941. It was the day when an Anglo-German war began to turn into a world war. It was the day when Hitler set in train his own failure and death and the destruction of his country. And it was the day that designed the postwar world. In the cold war years, the mighty Sebastian Haffner of the Observer used to say: \u201cWe are living in Hitler\u2019s Europe.\u201d He meant that on that June morning, Hitler had made three things inevitable. The first was his own defeat; in the long run, no invader could overcome the colossal resources of Russia and the courage of its peoples. The second was that Germany would not only be devastated but would be broken up into satellite states shaped by the victors. The third was that Russian power would surge forward right into the centre of Europe \u2013 something western statesmen had struggled to prevent for two centuries. There the Soviet armies would meet Anglo-American armies entering Germany from the west, a confrontation which would lead to the permanent division of our continent into two hostile camps \u2013 the cold war. We were to live in \u201cHitler\u2019s Europe\u201d until 1989 (with the collapse of the Berlin Wall). By the summer of 1941, in any case, the war was starting to spread beyond Europe. China\u2019s long war against Japanese imperialism was still a separate affair, but north Africa had become a battlefield as the Italians, and then the German Afrika-Korps attempted to drive the British out of Egypt. The British pushed Italy out of Abyssinia and Eritrea, and suppressed a pro-German rising in Iraq. And under the Royal Navy\u2019s protection, troops and equipment from India and colonial Africa were pouring into north Africa and Britain itself. *** Late in 1941, two almost insane decisions completed the transformation into a true world war. On 7 December Japanese aircraft attacked the American fleet at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. In doing so, they challenged the Pacific\u2019s superpower to battle just as they were engaged in a gigantic offensive to conquer the French, British and Dutch empires in south-east Asia \u2013 a gamble that succeeded at first but ultimately turned out to be far beyond Japan\u2019s resources. A few days later, Hitler inexplicably declared war on the US. There was no sober reason for it, beyond showing solidarity with Japan. It\u2019s hard to remember now how little Europeans (and Americans) knew about foreign countries in those days. Hitler genuinely believed that the US was a nation of pampered cowards, \u201chalf Judaized, half negrified\u201d, unable to produce real soldiers. President Roosevelt had been arming and supplying Britain for more than a year. But now America joined Britain and the Soviet Union as a full member of the military alliance dedicated to the defeat and \u201cunconditional surrender\u201d of Germany and Japan, as well as Italy. Troops, aircraft and supplies flowed into Britain; American equipment reached Russia on perilous Arctic convoys. Almost at once, the Americans began to urge Churchill to launch an invasion of Nazi-held France, to relieve the pressure on the Soviet Union. Stalin joined the chorus for a second front in 1942. Churchill refused. Years more preparation were needed if a cross-Channel invasion were not to fail. Meanwhile, 1942 was a grim time for Britain as Japan collapsed the British empire in south-east Asia, conquering Malaya and Singapore and marching through Burma towards India. But it was on the eastern front, in the Soviet Union, that the outcome of the war was decided. Hitler had invaded Yugoslavia and then Greece, critically reducing the strength he needed in Russia, and on 8 December 1941 \u2013 the day after Pearl Harbor \u2013 the Nazi advance was finally halted in the snow a few miles before Moscow. But it was not until early 1943 that the tide of this colossal struggle began to turn, as the German 6th Army, cut off at Stalingrad, was forced to surrender after losing 140,000 dead. The decisive battle began in July at Kursk, the biggest tank battle in history, as the Red Army (well warned by spies) attacked the flanks of a huge Nazi thrust. Two million men and nearly 6,000 tanks took part. After Kursk, the Soviets began an inexorable advance which would bring them, two years later, to Berlin. Elsewhere, the anti-Axis coalition was at last winning campaigns and liberating territory. The Americans landed in Algeria and, with the British driving victoriously across Libya, threw the Germans out of north Africa. Soon the Allies had taken Sicily and \u2013 as Italy dropped out of the war \u2013 American, British, Polish, French and New Zealand troops were fighting their way up the Italian peninsula. Stalin dominated the Teheran conference of the \u201cbig three\u201d, held at the end of 1943. The Red Army was carrying the main burden of the war in Europe. Churchill had not yet launched the promised cross-Channel invasion, and the strength of the US war economy was only beginning to show as Japanese and American air and naval power clashed in the Pacific. President Roosevelt did not press Stalin about his plans for \u201cliberated\u201d Europe. Instead, he welcomed Soviet support for a \u201cunited nations organisation\u201d after the war, and Stalin\u2019s promise to attack Japan. *** In June 1944, the Allies finally stormed the Normandy beaches. After months of fierce fighting, the Germans retreated and by the end of the year France, Belgium and most of Holland had been liberated. The invasion was coordinated with another huge Soviet offensive, which broke through and drove on to the outskirts of Warsaw. The city rose to free itself before it fell under Soviet control, but the Red Army halted and allowed the Germans to suppress the rising and massacre the population. By the summer of 1944, it was obvious that Germany had lost the war which it had won in 1940. But it dragged on for another nine months. Armies fought their way into the Reich from east and west; German cities crumpled under the obliterating firestorms of Allied bombing; Germany\u2019s children died clutching anti-tank grenades while their mothers and sisters were raped by the invaders. Why? There were four main reasons why the Reich fought on. The first was the Allies\u2019 insistence on \u201cunconditional surrender\u201d \u2013 no negotiated peace. The second was the incredible resilience of German soldiers, who never seemed to lose their power of instant counterattack. The third was the hypnotic grip of Adolf Hitler\u2019s personal cult, decaying into a belief that loyalty to somebody, to anybody or anything, was the last lifebelt in an ocean of meaningless horror. The fourth reason was that many Germans, not only leading Nazis, knew what had been done in their name. From the Russians, at least, they expected no mercy. But, strangely, efforts to conceal evidence of the greatest crime of all, the murder of six million Jews, were late and erratic. In that summer of 1944, the Auschwitz gas chambers were still killing 10,000 Hungarian Jews a day (the last death train reached Auschwitz at the end of October). *** On 29 April 1945, as Russian troops closed in on his Berlin bunker, Hitler killed himself. On 7 May, after a messy series of local surrenders, Germany finally stopped fighting. Two historic conferences between the victorious Allies, Yalta that February and Potsdam in July, confirmed the future outlines of \u201cHitler\u2019s Europe\u201d, a cold war continent divided between two hostile military pacts, with a few nervous neutrals on the fringes. At Yalta, Roosevelt and Churchill accepted that the half of Europe already \u201cliberated\u201d by Soviet forces would remain a Soviet zone of influence. Its countries became Moscow\u2019s puppets for the next 44 years, suffering decades of police terror, censorship and privation. The fate of Poland, which had suffered atrociously under Nazi occupation while staying loyal to the Allies from the first day of the war to the last, was especially agonising. To this day, Poles consider that the west sold them out at Yalta. But by then, only a third world war might have pushed Soviet power back to its own frontiers. The second world war had only one unqualified winner: the US. Defeating Japan, expected to take several more years and cost a million casualties, was achieved on two days that August, as atomic bombs incinerated Hiroshima and Nagasaki together with their inhabitants. America emerged as by far the greatest industrial power on earth, supplying almost insatiable demand from its own internal market and from the reconstruction of a ruined western Europe \u2013 given hard-currency purchasing power through the Marshall Plan. There followed the \u201cAmerican half-century\u201d, in which the US\u2019s hegemony \u2013 economic, cultural and military \u2013 controlled most of the non-communist world. The first world war had destroyed the old land empires of Eurasia by military defeat and revolution. The second world war led to the slow foundering of Europe\u2019s colonial empires \u2013 British, French, Dutch, Belgian and Portuguese. Military experience, spreading education, the ideals of the Russian Revolution, even the sudden leap in earnings caused by wartime demand for African and Asian raw materials, all encouraged colonised peoples to demand independence. It was won sometimes by negotiation, sometimes by bloody and prolonged \u201cliberation struggles\u201d. The world atlas changed colour. So did the streets of western Europe. Old imperial states, traditionally identified as white and Christian, now began to receive a massive inflow of immigrants, at first from north Africa and the Caribbean, later broadening to draw in settlers from south Asia and tropical Africa. These migrations followed the colossal population movements within Europe as the war ended. Millions took to the roads home as the Reich\u2019s forced labourers escaped and the gates of the concentration camps fell open. Ethnic cleansing on an unimaginable scale drove some 12 million Germans from their homes in eastern and central Europe. Polish families uprooted from their villages in Belarus or Ukraine moved into renamed German cities whose inhabitants in turn had been expelled. Far to the east, Stalin deported Chechens, Tatars and Greeks to starve in central Asian deserts. In those six years of war, the world had shrunk. Continents got to know one another. Rural English girls goggled at black American soldiers, then adored their courtesy and their dance steps. In Nazi Berlin, teenagers listened to Dizzy Gillespie on American Forces Network, growing clearer as the tanks drew nearer. At my school, we lay in the grass \u2013 the turf trembling in the thunder from five miles above us, as hundreds of silvery Liberators passed in formation to bomb France \u2013 and we said: \u201cMaybe everybody will fly everywhere after the war. Maybe we\u2019ll go to Alaska and meet Eskimos, and then Africa and meet real Zulus.\u201d Europe seemed a dark place, where the Germans crouched and horrible stuff happened. But one day the headmaster gathered us to hear a poem written \u201cover there\u201d and somehow smuggled across the Channel by the Resistance. It was by Paul \u00c9luard: \u201cI was born to know you, / To utter your name / Libert\u00e9.\u201d Resistance, its memory and myth, restored to Europeans a scrap of dignity under Nazi occupation and afterwards. Except in Poland and above all in Yugoslavia, its military impact was minor. But libert\u00e9 came to mean more than chasing out the Germans. It meant change. Europe experienced a \u201cresistance moment\u201d from about 1943 to the start of the cold war in 1947, in which men and women emerged from clandestinity to demand and plan radical national renewal. Their prewar governments, they believed, had surrendered to fascism because they were corrupt, grossly unequal, lacking moral legitimacy. Now socialist and communist ex-partisans, many of them survivors of Gestapo torture, dominated many of the first post-liberation governments. But it was not long before growing cold war paranoia, Stalinist or anti-communist, broke their alliance apart. Resisters were usually a tiny minority. Most people in Nazi-occupied Europe had spent hungry, humiliating years keeping their heads down. Only afterwards did they recover self-respect by identifying with the patriotic sacrifice of the few. It took a generation before France could admit that \u2013 for example \u2013 French officials had arranged the transport of 4,500 Jewish children to be gassed and burned in the Nazi death camps. The ruins left by the war were moral as well as physical. Our Europe is built on them. The dream of a united Europe started as a plan to rebuild the integrity and authority of its disgraced nation states, something which those states were still too weak to manage by themselves. The vision of a supranational union without internal frontiers, making future wars unthinkable, was secondary. Later, Charles de Gaulle was to talk of a Europe des patries, rather than a United States of Europe. He is still right. The \u201cresistance moment\u201d led into the Trente Glorieuses \u2013 the 30 years in which the peoples of western Europe mended their wreckage and became more prosperous, more secure, more equal and better educated than ever before \u2013 or since. Britain, too, had used the war years to plan the great postwar settlement which seemed \u2013 for a time \u2013 to be consigning poverty, gross wealth and health differences, inflation and \u201cbankers\u2019 economics\u201d to history. People looked back at the war and the 1930s, and said: \u201cNever again!\u201d And yet Britain was turning in on itself as the war ended. \u201cWe stood alone against Hitler.\u201d But Britain was actually more isolated in the postwar decades than in 1940. Back then \u2013 for all its marvellous defiance after Dunkirk \u2013 Britain was supported by the armed forces of the Commonwealth and the resources of the empire, to say nothing of American aid. Myths about wartime soon took hold. Hadn\u2019t Britain triumphed by just being itself \u2013 by being the comically amateurish, strangulated and yet quietly heroic England of the conservative vision? Films made in wartime starred soldier-characters who often didn\u2019t talk posh. But in the war movies of the 1950s and 1960s, the heroes were usually officers with public school accents. Perhaps, too, things seen or experienced in that war left the British with a special trauma, a revulsion against the outside world. When British troops entered the vast concentration camp at Bergen-Belsen, a decision was taken to bring as many soldiers as possible \u2013 young officers especially \u2013 to see it. I came to know quite a few of them later. All were deeply damaged. They had known about Nazi brutality, of course, but this\u2026 it was beyond just \u201cthe Germans\u201d. They had no idea that human beings of any description were capable of this. French, Polish, Dutch witnesses did have at least an idea. But these officers were damaged not only in their English innocence but in their own sense of humanity. If Europe was a place where such things were imaginable, how intimate with Europe could one become? *** Sometimes the cruelty of war shows more clearly in small, quiet scenes than in battles and bombings. When I think of the second world war, I see the platform of an English railway station, in the bitter cold of a wartime night. A train is waiting, a wisp of white steam flickering in the lamplight. My mother and I have brought P and her fiance to the station. He is returning to his submarine. The odds on him and his crew surviving are not good. We sit on a bench outside the ticket office, while P \u2013 smiling hard \u2013 walks with her man to the end of the platform. Nobody else is about. We can just see them as he leans out of the window of the compartment, their heads close together. Then the engine whistles, the train begins to move. P stands still, as the carriages and finally the red tail-light on the guard\u2019s van slowly pass her and vanish into the night. Alone, she starts back towards us, very upright and brisk-stepping. My mother, a naval wife who knows about farewells, opens her bag and takes out two large, clean white handkerchiefs. She stands up. P has come quite close to us when I see her knees begin to buckle. My mother moves swiftly to catch her as she falls and guide her to the bench. I walk away for a while, so I don\u2019t hear or see. I\u2019m a wartime child, so I too know this routine. Wartime, peacetime, like winter and summer, the natural alternation. It\u2019s a cruel moment, and I have learned that war is cruel. But nobody has taught me yet that war doesn\u2019t have to happen.

      "bodyText": "A group of pioneering Jamaican reggae musicians reunite to record an acoustic album in this engaging documentary that draws immediate comparisons with Buena Vista Social Club. Taking as its entry point a crowd-pleasing selection of seminal reggae tracks, Inna De Yard also explores Jamaica\u2019s cultural history and social issues. The structure and rhythm of the film are perhaps a little familiar, but then so is the music, which is part of the picture\u2019s unassuming appeal. Both the film and its cast of charismatic, dreadlocked old-timers are loaded with an easy charm that is as heady as anything that gets smoked during the course of the recording sessions.",

      "bodyText": "The re-embrace of jazz in recent years has come from both mainstream acts such as Kendrick Lamar and young outsiders like Britain\u2019s Shabaka Hutchings. More surprising is Tom Barman, frontman of Belgian artrockers dEUS, forming a jazz quartet with a trio of fellow countrymen. Barman\u2019s move is not that startling \u2013 the singer is a long-time, self-proclaimed fan who has overseen compilations for the Blue Note and Impulse labels \u2013 but Taxi Wars is a very different beast to dEUS: a cooking, post-bop quartet led by tenor sax Robin Verheyen allied to Barman\u2019s songwriting. This second album follows on seamlessly from 2016\u2019s Fever, mixing deep grooves and hip-hop vocals on Drop Shot and The Glare (the latter opening with an exposition on ancient Greek goddesses) with slower, ruminative pieces like Irritated Love, an elegant dissection of a troubled affair, with echoes of Chet Baker.

Fresh off a run of August London dates and a special <a href=\"https://www.manchesterpride.com/news/ariana-grande-and-years-years-to-headline-manchester-pride-live\" title=\"\">performance in Manchester</a> for Pride, the singer now takes her huge album of last year, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/aug/19/ariana-grande-sweetener-review\" title=\"\">Sweetener</a></em>, <a href=\"https://www.arianagrande.com/events\" title=\"\">around</a> the rest of the UK; she\u2019s recently added a further two London dates at the end of October.</p> <p>Our own <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jul/08/charli-xcx-every-single-thing-is-work-for-me-everything-is-music-interview\" title=\"\">Charli XCX</a></strong>, meanwhile, wondered whether she would ever release another album proper.

Based on the book by the <em>Guardian</em>\u2019s Moscow correspondent Luke Harding, <strong>A Very Expensive Poison</strong> considers how in 2006 the Russian spy, MI6 informant and Putin critic died of radiation poisoning after drinking a cup of green tea in a central London hotel. The play is <a href=\"https://www.oldvictheatre.com/whats-on/2019/a-very-expensive-poison\" title=\"\">at the Old Vic</a> until 5 October: John Crowley directs; Tom Brooke and MyAnna Buring play the Litvinenkos, Reece Shearsmith is Putin. <strong>Susannah Clapp</strong></p> <h2>Film: Ken Loach takes on the gig economy</h2> <p>Ken Loach brings the same scalding anger to the gig economy in <strong>Sorry We Missed You</strong> as he did to the benefits system with <em>I, Daniel Blake</em>. And, in Newcastle upon Tyne, the films also share the same location. This portrait of a family strained to breaking point by a treadmill of hard graft and mounting debt is superbly acted and unwavering in its focus. The deliberate pacing and edgy, restless camera give the story a cruel momentum and sense of the walls closing in on a hapless delivery driver who just wants to do well by his kids. <strong>Wendy Ide</strong></p> <h2>Art: Troy: Myth and Reality at the British Museum</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7a5aab472dd8353581b416ad60eab41f470c064c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a5aab472dd8353581b416ad60eab41f470c064c/0_935_8984_5391/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fillippo Albacini\u2019s The Wounded Achilles, part of Troy: Myth and Reality at the British Museum.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fillippo Albacini\u2019s The Wounded Achilles, part of Troy: Myth and Reality at the British Museum.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: British Museum</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Did Helen really exist? Did the most beautiful woman in the world actually provoke the destruction of one of the greatest cities of all time? And why are there so many different versions of the story, from Homer to Shakespeare to Hollywood? <a href=\"https://www.britishmuseum.org/whats_on/exhibitions/troy.aspx\" title=\"\">This magnificent show</a> plunges us deep into the myth and the reality, bringing alive the captivating characters of this ancient civilisation through sculptures, paintings, vases and fragments of literature, proving that there was a real Troy, and revealing its fate. From 21 November to 8 March.<strong> Laura Cumming</strong></p> <h2>Music: live UK grime and hip-hop</h2> <p>We are quite possibly in UK rap\u2019s golden age, and autumn\u2019s live shows epitomise that. Two of this year\u2019s Mercury prize nominees, the powerful <strong><a href=\"https://www.littlesimz.co/\" title=\"\">Little Simz</a></strong> and raucous <strong><a href=\"https://www.slowthai.com/\" title=\"\">Slowthai</a></strong>, are both touring the country, as is one of Afroswing\u2019s finest, <strong>MoStack</strong>, riding high off his debut LP. Ladbroke Grove star <strong>AJ Tracey</strong> will be playing Ally Pally, while Charlie Sloth\u2019s infamous <em>Fire in the Booth</em> show will be getting a September live edition with a first-time festival in Sheffield (with the somewhat dubious title of <strong><a href=\"https://fireinthepark.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Fire in the Park</a></strong>), featuring the likes of Giggs and Yxng Bane. Grime don <strong>Skepta</strong> is heading up a phenomenal <a href=\"https://www.thewarehouseproject.com/event/skepta-presents\" title=\"\">Warehouse Project</a> line-up in November (rising stars Octavian and Flohio are among others playing that day). Finally, the release of Kano\u2019s <em>Class of Deja</em> has arguably been the biggest grime moment of the year (second only to Stormzy at Glastonbury) \u2013 accordingly, <strong><a href=\"http://www.kanomusic.com/\" title=\"\">Kano\u2019s tour</a> </strong>this October is a must, culminating in a show at the Royal Albert Hall. <strong>Tara Joshi</strong></p> <h2>Books: the most anticipated</h2> <p>Ben Lerner\u2019s third novel, <strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/topeka-school-9781783785360.html\" title=\"\">The Topeka School</a></strong> (3 October), is an education in the sympathetic imagination, a deep and bracing intellectual challenge, a powerful political statement. As usual, Lerner plays winningly in the fertile ground between fiction and memoir, as usual he is often hilarious and occasionally infuriating. Wider-reaching, subtler and kinder than his earlier works, this is a novel to cherish.</p> <p>We return to Gilead in another Booker-longlisted novel, Margaret Atwood\u2019s <strong><a href=\"https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/1115319/the-testaments/9781784742324.html\" title=\"\">The Testaments</a></strong> (10 September) which carries powerful messages for the #MeToo generation. It\u2019s striking that this novel is published just before another highly anticipated book, <em><a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/586563/she-said-by-jodi-kantor-and-megan-twohey/9780525560340/\" title=\"\">She Said</a></em> by Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey, the journalists who broke the Harvey Weinstein scandal. Both should be required reading.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"04f25ae875dc14890df766f047bc837b8fc259aa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/04f25ae875dc14890df766f047bc837b8fc259aa/0_0_1565_2409/650.jpg\" alt=\"Rebecca Solnit\u2019s Whose Story is This?\" width=\"650\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Zadie Smith\u2019s short stories are predictably luminous, insightful and full of glorious prose. It\u2019s hard to believe that <strong>Grand Union</strong> (3 October) is her first collection, drawing as it does on more than a decade of writing for the <em>New Yorker</em>. She\u2019s already one of our best novelists and essayists; this reminds us that her short stories are right up there too.</p> <p>Jonathan Safran Foer is always fascinating on the subject of vegetarianism \u2013 his <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/jonathan-safran-foer\" title=\"\">Eating Animals</a></em> persuaded me to (almost) give up meat. <strong>We Are the Weather </strong>(10 October) shows the clear link between industrialised animal farming and climate breakdown in a book of scintillating relevance and authority.</p> <p>In these times of political turbulence and an increasingly rabid and scrofulous commentariat, the sanity, wisdom and clarity of Rebecca Solnit\u2019s writing is a forceful corrective. <strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/whose-story-is-this-9781783785438.html\" title=\"\">Whose Story Is This?</a></strong> (5 September) is a scorchingly intelligent collection about the struggle to control narratives in the internet age. <strong>Alex Preston</strong></p> <h2>Film: Chris Morris and Armando Iannucci go their own ways</h2> <p>Two of the UK\u2019s most accomplished satirists, Chris Morris and Armando Iannucci, both launch films this autumn. But the pair, who previously collaborated on the TV series <em>The Day Today</em>, take markedly diverging approaches with their respective projects. Morris, who skewered Islamist terrorism in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/may/09/four-lions-film-review\" title=\"\">Four Lions</a></em>, turns his focus on the US law enforcement agencies that manufacture threats in order to justify department funding. The anger in <strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqJyhh2PFBw\" title=\"\">The Day Shall Come</a></strong> is to be expected; the stab of poignancy comes as a surprise. Iannucci, meanwhile, has left his habitual political arena (<em>Veep</em>, <em>In the Loop</em>, <em>The Death of Stalin</em>) and adapted Dickens\u2019s <em>David Copperfield</em>. <strong><a href=\"https://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/news-bfi/announcements/european-premiere-armando-iannuccis-personal-history-david\" title=\"\">The Personal History of David Copperfield </a></strong>stars Dev Patel in the title role and opens the London film festival. <strong>WI</strong></p> <h2>Art: Margate festival</h2> <p>Margate expanded as a centre for art with the opening of the Carl Freedman Gallery in the old Thanet Press building, next to Tracey Emin\u2019s studio, in May. Its second exhibition, <strong>Gossamer</strong>, curated by Zoe Bedeaux, brings together 22 artists \u2013 including Ulay, Louise Bourgeois and Sarah Lucas \u2013 who work with tights or stockings, and will open on 28 September. Also from 28 September, actor and art collector Russell Tovey curates <strong>Margate NOW</strong>, a town-wide festival of music, art and drama, including events in unexpected places from the railway station to the shore. And all of this accompanies the opening of the <strong>Turner </strong><strong>prize show</strong> at Turner Margate (28 September) with one of the strongest shortlists in many years, bringing together Lawrence Abu Hamdan, Helen Cammock, Tai Shani and Oscar Murillo. <strong>LC</strong></p> <h2>Film: Martin Scorsese\u2019s The Irishman</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7d8880c854c33be15ef59c5664a1ddd073096343\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7d8880c854c33be15ef59c5664a1ddd073096343/102_303_2297_1378/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joe Pesci, left, and Robert De Niro in Martin Scorsese\u2019s The Irishman.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joe Pesci, left, and Robert De Niro in Martin Scorsese\u2019s The Irishman.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Niko Tavernise/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Anticipation around Martin Scorsese\u2019s plan to dramatise the real-life story of mob hitman Frank \u201cThe Irishman\u201d Sheeran, who was involved in the notorious disappearance of labour union leader Jimmy Hoffa in 1975, has been cranking up for years.

In a period of flux for the real royal family, it seems timely for sumptuous biopic <strong>The Crown</strong> to return with a fresh cast. Oscar-winner Olivia Colman succeeds Claire Foy as the Queen, with Tobias Menzies as Prince Phillip and, deliciously, Helen Bonham Carter as Princess Margaret.

Now it\u2019s been revived on Netflix with the backing of Canadian superstar Drake. The reboot, which drops on 13 September, sees Dushane (Ashley Walters) and Sully (Kane \u201cKano\u201d Robinson) return from exile to reclaim their territory, only to find an ambitious new generation are now running things. Rappers Little Simz and Dave join the cast, alongside exciting new discovery Micheal Ward.

No need for distant historical allegories on his latest record <em>2020</em> (Weird World, 11 October), which is less a snapshot of contemporary Britain than a full-scale narrative immersion. The Newcastle folk-rocker, whose interests extend to Sufi devotional music and beyond, tells first-person stories of ordinary Englanders trapped in an increasingly cruel system, which sucks their souls dry for profit. Listening to civil servants unravelling at the thought of depriving yet another poor soul of their disability living allowance may sound like hard going, but <em>2020</em> is funny, freaky and unexpectedly melodic as well as desperately moving \u2013 you won\u2019t hear a better song about the hell of working in Amazon-style distribution warehouses than Dawson\u2019s 10-minute Fulfilment Centre. <strong>KF</strong></p> <h2>Theatre: shows with pop star scores</h2> <p>It\u2019s farewell to Sarah Frankcom, who\u2019s been a brilliant head of the Manchester Royal Exchange \u2013 but she should go out with a bang with <strong><a href=\"https://www.royalexchange.co.uk/whats-on-and-tickets/light-falls\" title=\"\">Light Falls</a></strong> (from 24 October).

Where else can you take in Lambeth Palace and the Marx Memorial Library in a single weekend? Marking the centenary of the Addison Act, which made \u201chousing for all\u201d a government policy, some of London\u2019s key postwar housing schemes will also open their doors for the first time. They include Alexandra Road in Camden, the Golden Lane Estate and Ern\u00f6 Goldfinger\u2019s twin monuments to brutalism, Trellick Tower and Balfron Tower. Other London landmarks, such as the BT Tower and 10 Downing Street, will be available to visit by online ballot. <strong>Catherine Slessor</strong></p> <h2>Theatre: tasty American imports</h2> <p>Branden Jacob-Jenkins \u2013 who has had hits here with <em>An Octoroon </em>and <em>Gloria</em> \u2013 brings his 2014 play <strong>Appropriate</strong> to the Donmar until 5 October (see review, page 40). The Lafayette family return to their late father\u2019s house, a former plantation in Arkansas \u2013 and this, being a Jacob-Jenkins play, is a slanted, subversive take on the classic American family drama. It\u2019s directed by Ola Ince (<em>The Convert</em>), and stars Monica Dolan.</p> <p>There\u2019s more family feuding in <strong>Fairview</strong> \u2013 which won Jackie Sibblies Drury this year\u2019s Pulitzer prize for drama, and which promises to rip the genre to shreds. At London\u2019s Young Vic from 28 November, directed by Nadia Latif, this race drama should provoke, unsettle and dazzle audiences here too. </p> <p>Annie Baker is back at the National Theatre \u2013 which staged her hugely acclaimed plays <em>John</em> and <em>The Flick</em> \u2013 with <strong>The Antipodes</strong>, in which people sit around a table, telling, examining, and categorising stories.

      "bodyText": "Film: literary adaptations You know Oscar season is approaching when the weather gets chillier and the options at the cinema get a little more literary \u2013 and so autumn duly brings two star-laden adaptations of major modern American novels. First comes The Goldfinch on 27 September: Donna Tartt\u2019s epic Pulitzer prize-winner sprawls in a way some pundits thought more suited to a TV miniseries, but building on the Oscar-nominated success of Brooklyn, director John Crowley is tackling it for the big screen, with Ansel Elgort heading the cast as semi-orphaned wanderer Theo Decker, and Nicole Kidman ideally cast as Mrs Barbour. On 30 November, Jonathan Lethem\u2019s celebrated detective odyssey Motherless Brooklyn hits cinemas courtesy of director and star Edward Norton \u2013 venturing behind the camera for the first time in 19 years. Both are challenging projects: will they do their source material justice? Meanwhile, you have some catch-up time if you haven\u2019t read either novel \u2013 otherwise how can you say \u201cthe book was better\u201d with any kind of airy authority? Guy Lodge Music: pop overdrive Any UK tour by Ariana Grande will always be emotional. Fresh off a run of August London dates and a special performance in Manchester for Pride, the singer now takes her huge album of last year, Sweetener, around the rest of the UK; she\u2019s recently added a further two London dates at the end of October. Our own Charli XCX, meanwhile, wondered whether she would ever release another album proper. But after five years of innovative mixtapes and arresting standalone singles comes a full-on studio effort \u2013 Charli \u2013 on 13 September, studded with guests as diverse as Christine and the Queens, bedroom pop auteur Clairo and self-styled queen of New Orleans \u201cbounce\u201d, Big Freedia. Charli\u2019s former tour mate, candid US singer Halsey, has hinted \u2013 in a mocked-up mugshot in the video for her track Nightmare in May \u2013 at an October release date for her own \u201cloud\u201d third album, widely expected to be called Manic. Halsey has described the writing process as one of \u201clearning to forgive myself\u201d. Kitty Empire TV: Westeros-induced fantasy Since Game of Thrones slayed the world \u2013 let\u2019s forget that damp squib of a final series \u2013 the fantasy genre is back in televisual vogue. Screenwriters have been raiding the bookshelves for similar sagas to adapt and the first wave of Westeros-influenced series arrive this autumn. Orlando Bloom and Cara Delevingne star in neo-noir romance Carnival Row, arriving on Amazon Prime Video this week, and set in a Victorian city where humans and mythical creatures live side by side. Netflix has The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance, a 10-part prequel to Jim Henson\u2019s beloved 1982 fantasy film with the likes of Mark Hamill, Helena Bonham-Carter, Toby Jones, Gugu Mbatha-Raw and Eddie Izzard voicing characters. Most promising, though, is the BBC and HBO\u2019s ambitious adaptation of Philip Pullman\u2019s His Dark Materials trilogy. With a cast led by James McAvoy, Ruth Wilson, Lin-Manuel Miranda and, of course, an armoured CGI polar bear, confidence in its success is so high that a second series is already commissioned. George RR who? Michael Hogan Theatre: political poison After her triumphs with Enron and The Effect, dramatist Lucy Prebble turns her unswerving gaze on the death of Alexander Litvinenko. Based on the book by the Guardian\u2019s Moscow correspondent Luke Harding, A Very Expensive Poison considers how in 2006 the Russian spy, MI6 informant and Putin critic died of radiation poisoning after drinking a cup of green tea in a central London hotel. The play is at the Old Vic until 5 October: John Crowley directs; Tom Brooke and MyAnna Buring play the Litvinenkos, Reece Shearsmith is Putin. Susannah Clapp Film: Ken Loach takes on the gig economy Ken Loach brings the same scalding anger to the gig economy in Sorry We Missed You as he did to the benefits system with I, Daniel Blake. And, in Newcastle upon Tyne, the films also share the same location. This portrait of a family strained to breaking point by a treadmill of hard graft and mounting debt is superbly acted and unwavering in its focus. The deliberate pacing and edgy, restless camera give the story a cruel momentum and sense of the walls closing in on a hapless delivery driver who just wants to do well by his kids. Wendy Ide Art: Troy: Myth and Reality at the British Museum Did Helen really exist? Did the most beautiful woman in the world actually provoke the destruction of one of the greatest cities of all time? And why are there so many different versions of the story, from Homer to Shakespeare to Hollywood? This magnificent show plunges us deep into the myth and the reality, bringing alive the captivating characters of this ancient civilisation through sculptures, paintings, vases and fragments of literature, proving that there was a real Troy, and revealing its fate. From 21 November to 8 March. Laura Cumming Music: live UK grime and hip-hop We are quite possibly in UK rap\u2019s golden age, and autumn\u2019s live shows epitomise that. Two of this year\u2019s Mercury prize nominees, the powerful Little Simz and raucous Slowthai, are both touring the country, as is one of Afroswing\u2019s finest, MoStack, riding high off his debut LP. Ladbroke Grove star AJ Tracey will be playing Ally Pally, while Charlie Sloth\u2019s infamous Fire in the Booth show will be getting a September live edition with a first-time festival in Sheffield (with the somewhat dubious title of Fire in the Park), featuring the likes of Giggs and Yxng Bane. Grime don Skepta is heading up a phenomenal Warehouse Project line-up in November (rising stars Octavian and Flohio are among others playing that day). Finally, the release of Kano\u2019s Class of Deja has arguably been the biggest grime moment of the year (second only to Stormzy at Glastonbury) \u2013 accordingly, Kano\u2019s tour this October is a must, culminating in a show at the Royal Albert Hall. Tara Joshi Books: the most anticipated Ben Lerner\u2019s third novel, The Topeka School (3 October), is an education in the sympathetic imagination, a deep and bracing intellectual challenge, a powerful political statement. As usual, Lerner plays winningly in the fertile ground between fiction and memoir, as usual he is often hilarious and occasionally infuriating. Wider-reaching, subtler and kinder than his earlier works, this is a novel to cherish. We return to Gilead in another Booker-longlisted novel, Margaret Atwood\u2019s The Testaments (10 September) which carries powerful messages for the #MeToo generation. It\u2019s striking that this novel is published just before another highly anticipated book, She Said by Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey, the journalists who broke the Harvey Weinstein scandal. Both should be required reading. Zadie Smith\u2019s short stories are predictably luminous, insightful and full of glorious prose. It\u2019s hard to believe that Grand Union (3 October) is her first collection, drawing as it does on more than a decade of writing for the New Yorker. She\u2019s already one of our best novelists and essayists; this reminds us that her short stories are right up there too. Jonathan Safran Foer is always fascinating on the subject of vegetarianism \u2013 his Eating Animals persuaded me to (almost) give up meat. We Are the Weather (10 October) shows the clear link between industrialised animal farming and climate breakdown in a book of scintillating relevance and authority. In these times of political turbulence and an increasingly rabid and scrofulous commentariat, the sanity, wisdom and clarity of Rebecca Solnit\u2019s writing is a forceful corrective. Whose Story Is This? (5 September) is a scorchingly intelligent collection about the struggle to control narratives in the internet age. Alex Preston Film: Chris Morris and Armando Iannucci go their own ways Two of the UK\u2019s most accomplished satirists, Chris Morris and Armando Iannucci, both launch films this autumn. But the pair, who previously collaborated on the TV series The Day Today, take markedly diverging approaches with their respective projects. Morris, who skewered Islamist terrorism in Four Lions, turns his focus on the US law enforcement agencies that manufacture threats in order to justify department funding. The anger in The Day Shall Come is to be expected; the stab of poignancy comes as a surprise. Iannucci, meanwhile, has left his habitual political arena (Veep, In the Loop, The Death of Stalin) and adapted Dickens\u2019s David Copperfield. The Personal History of David Copperfield stars Dev Patel in the title role and opens the London film festival. WI Art: Margate festival Margate expanded as a centre for art with the opening of the Carl Freedman Gallery in the old Thanet Press building, next to Tracey Emin\u2019s studio, in May. Its second exhibition, Gossamer, curated by Zoe Bedeaux, brings together 22 artists \u2013 including Ulay, Louise Bourgeois and Sarah Lucas \u2013 who work with tights or stockings, and will open on 28 September. Also from 28 September, actor and art collector Russell Tovey curates Margate NOW, a town-wide festival of music, art and drama, including events in unexpected places from the railway station to the shore. And all of this accompanies the opening of the Turner prize show at Turner Margate (28 September) with one of the strongest shortlists in many years, bringing together Lawrence Abu Hamdan, Helen Cammock, Tai Shani and Oscar Murillo. LC Film: Martin Scorsese\u2019s The Irishman Anticipation around Martin Scorsese\u2019s plan to dramatise the real-life story of mob hitman Frank \u201cThe Irishman\u201d Sheeran, who was involved in the notorious disappearance of labour union leader Jimmy Hoffa in 1975, has been cranking up for years. Now it\u2019s finally hitting cinemas on 8 November, with Robert De Niro as Sheeran and Al Pacino as Hoffa \u2013 but with only a brief window before it streams on Netflix on 27 November. This is familiar ground for Scorsese but the pedigree is high: Steven Zaillian (Schindler\u2019s List) wrote the script and Joe Pesci, Harvey Keitel and Anna Paquin co-star. Killian Fox Dance: high-profile debuts British ballet promises some intriguing major debuts by dancers. The Royal Ballet\u2019s Marcelino Samb\u00e9 marks his recent promotion to principal dancer by reprising his raffish Lescaut for Kenneth MacMillan\u2019s Manon, opening at Covent Garden in October, before taking a lead role as Franz in Copp\u00e9lia on 28 December. Expect buoyant technique and giddy charisma from this young ace. Northern Ballet\u2019s Antoinette Brooks-Daw is moving into the company\u2019s top rank following rich turns in Cathy Marston\u2019s Jane Eyre and Victoria. Catch her displaying her narrative chops in Morgann Runacre-Temple\u2019s Kingdom of Back \u2013 part of a new mixed bill along with David Nixon\u2019s Dracula (Leeds, Doncaster and Canterbury, September/October). And then there\u2019s former Washington Ballet star Brooklyn Mack who joins English National Ballet as a guest artist. Fresh from a well-received stint at American Ballet Theatre, he has roles in Christopher Wheeldon\u2019s Cinderella (Manchester, Southampton, October) and Anna\u2011Marie Holmes\u2019s Le Corsaire (Milton Keynes, November). Sara Veale TV: contrasting London dramas on Netflix Two starkly different views of the capital arrive on the streaming service this autumn. In a period of flux for the real royal family, it seems timely for sumptuous biopic The Crown to return with a fresh cast. Oscar-winner Olivia Colman succeeds Claire Foy as the Queen, with Tobias Menzies as Prince Phillip and, deliciously, Helen Bonham Carter as Princess Margaret. Covering the period from 1964 to 1976, it glides majestically on to Netflix on 17 November. The other comeback is more surprising but entirely welcome. Top Boy, writer Ronan Bennett\u2019s down-and-dirty thriller about Hackney drug gangs, was bafflingly axed by Channel 4 six years ago. Now it\u2019s been revived on Netflix with the backing of Canadian superstar Drake. The reboot, which drops on 13 September, sees Dushane (Ashley Walters) and Sully (Kane \u201cKano\u201d Robinson) return from exile to reclaim their territory, only to find an ambitious new generation are now running things. Rappers Little Simz and Dave join the cast, alongside exciting new discovery Micheal Ward. (See feature on page 20.) MH Film: prestige sci-fi Away from the superhero glut of summer, autumn has become the new season for more grown-up sci-fi escapism: recently Interstellar, Arrival and Blade Runner 2049 all opted for the cooler months. The biggest-budget project yet from American auteur James Gray (revered in France, underrated everywhere else), Ad Astra stars Brad Pitt as an astronaut venturing deep into the solar system in search of his father; it premieres in competition at the Venice film festival and opens shortly after, on 18 September. Unpredictable as ever, two-time Oscar-winner Ang Lee (Brokeback Mountain, Life of Pi) returns with Gemini Man (in cinemas 11 October), a high-concept, hi-tech thriller with Will Smith as a hitman pursuing his younger self \u2013 it sounds a bit derivative of Rian Johnson\u2019s Looper, but in Lee we trust. If Hollywood fantasy doesn\u2019t do it for you, seek out Aniara (out now, reviewed page 32), a fascinating, meditative Swedish mission to Mars. In this version of space, no one can hear you scream, but at least you can hear yourself think. GL Music: the return of thoughtful indie A decade on since landfill indie seemed to consign guitar music to the dustbin of history, a new wave of innovative, boundary-pushing releases is on its way to expand the genre\u2019s horizons. Erstwhile Sexwitch vocalist Bat for Lashes embraces a dreamy 80s vibe on her forthcoming album Lost Girls (AWAL, 6 September): saxophone solos, arpeggiated synths and lyrics about female vampire biker gangs feature. Alabama Shakes frontwoman Brittany Howard releases her debut solo album, Jaime (Columbia, 20 September). Dedicated to her sister, who died of cancer when they were teens, it has a tender, expansive sound, encompassing soulful ruminations on love, spirituality, and growing up as a mixed-race child in the deep south. Angel Olsen follows up 2016\u2019s excellent My Woman with the magisterial yet delicate All Mirrors (Jagjaguwar, 4 October), preceded by a mesmerising new single of the same name with a cinematic black-and-white video. Finally, Michael Kiwanuka\u2019s meditative, assured third album Kiwanuka (Polydor, 25 October) spans psych-gospel, politics and self-acceptance, as well as nodding to his Ugandan heritage. Kathryn Bromwich Art: Tate Britain is having a moment Tate Britain is gathering new momentum this year, after the success of Van Gogh and Britain and Mike Nelson\u2019s elegiac Duveen Commission. Huge crowds are anticipated for its autumn exhibitions. These include William Blake, from 11 September, which doesn\u2019t focus on one particular area so much as the all-embracing originality of his vision, entering his mind through the works, and recreating the tiny room where they were made. Two Turner prizewinners follow: Mark Leckey (from 24 September) builds a life-size replica of a motorway bridge on the Wirral, where he grew up, as the scene for new video and audio works. And Steve McQueen brings his mass portrait of 70,000 primary school children to the museum: the nation\u2019s future, from 12 November. LC Classical: Agrippina at Royal Opera House Written for the Venice carnival season, Handel\u2019s early-career gem Agrippina, about one woman\u2019s lust for power, and rivalry in love, is staged for the Royal Opera House by the director of the moment, Barrie Kosky, with a glittering lineup led by American mezzo-soprano Joyce DiDonato, British countertenor Iestyn Davies and British soprano Lucy Crowe. Packed with explosive music and showpiece arias, this is a story for our times, of leadership and failed diplomacy. The Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment and cast are conducted by the Handel specialist and harpsichordist Maxim Emelyanychev. Fiona Maddocks Theatre: four new Caryl Churchill plays Not one, not two, but four short new works by our greatest living dramatist have landed, fully formed, in the Royal Court\u2019s lap, and are being staged in one quadruple bill. Which is basically Christmas come early for theatre fans. As usual with the publicity-averse Churchill, there\u2019s not much known about them yet, but Glass is reportedly about a girl made of glass, Kill deals with gods and murderers, Bluebeard tackles a serial killer\u2019s friends, and Imp concerns a secret in a bottle. James Macdonald, with whom Churchill worked on Escaped Alone, directs the lot for a limited three-week run (18 September to 12 October). Holly Williams Music: Richard Dawson\u2019s state-of-the-nation masterpiece On his 2017 album Peasant, Richard Dawson harked back to early medieval England to chronicle a nation at war with itself. No need for distant historical allegories on his latest record 2020 (Weird World, 11 October), which is less a snapshot of contemporary Britain than a full-scale narrative immersion. The Newcastle folk-rocker, whose interests extend to Sufi devotional music and beyond, tells first-person stories of ordinary Englanders trapped in an increasingly cruel system, which sucks their souls dry for profit. Listening to civil servants unravelling at the thought of depriving yet another poor soul of their disability living allowance may sound like hard going, but 2020 is funny, freaky and unexpectedly melodic as well as desperately moving \u2013 you won\u2019t hear a better song about the hell of working in Amazon-style distribution warehouses than Dawson\u2019s 10-minute Fulfilment Centre. KF Theatre: shows with pop star scores It\u2019s farewell to Sarah Frankcom, who\u2019s been a brilliant head of the Manchester Royal Exchange \u2013 but she should go out with a bang with Light Falls (from 24 October). A new play by Simon Stephens is always an event, but even more exciting is the man doing the music: one Jarvis Cocker. Light Falls connects five relatives living in cities across the north, and looks at how they\u2019re drawn together after a devastating event. More cheerful, perhaps, will be The Boy in the Dress \u2013 the RSC\u2019s new musical version of David Walliams\u2019s children\u2019s book, with songs by Robbie Williams and Guy Chambers. The story of Dennis, a 12-year-old who likes football and dresses, is adapted by Mark Ravenhill, and opens 8 November. HW Classical: Orpheus in the Coliseum ENO\u2019s ambitious season explores the Orpheus myth \u2013 the grief-stricken hero tries to rescue his lover from the Underworld \u2013 with four operas from the 18th century to the present. Directed by the choreographer Wayne McGregor in his ENO directorial debut, Gluck\u2019s Orpheus and Eurydice stars Alice Coote and Sarah Tynan; Harry Bicket conducts. Offenbach\u2019s comic Orpheus in the Underworld is one long, naughty, can-can dancing party. Ed Lyon and Mary Bevan head the cast. Sian Edwards conducts, Emma Rice directs. The unmissable rarities are Harrison Birtwistle\u2019s ritualistic masterpiece The Mask of Orpheus, director Daniel Kramer, conductor Martyn Brabbins; and Philip Glass\u2019s Orph\u00e9e, inspired by Cocteau; director Netia Jones, conductor Geoffrey Paterson. Discounts if you book the series. FM Theatre: Ibsen gets a makeover You might think we\u2019ve no shortage of Ibsen \u2013 but two new productions look to be bold, essential reimaginings. Hedda Tesman is by Cordelia Lynn (whose Three Sisters has recently been at the Almeida), and promises to breathe new life into Ibsen\u2019s classic, Hedda Gabler, for touring company Headlong. Haydn Gwynne stars in the title role (Chichester Festival theatre, 30 August-28 September; the Lowry, Salford 3-19 October). A new version of A Doll\u2019s House, written by Tanika Gupta \u2013 who moves the action to Calcutta and invites us to look at the play\u2019s gender politics through the lens of British colonialism \u2013 opens at the Lyric Hammersmith on 6 September. It\u2019s the first production by the west London theatre\u2019s new artistic director, Rachel O\u2019Riordan, and stars the captivating Anjana Vasan. HW TV: RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race comes to the UK Gentlemen, start your engines because Mama Ru is strutting, sashaying and shantaying our way. After becoming a global phenomenon over the past decade, the long-awaited UK edition of RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race launches on BBC Three in October, with 10 home-grown acts competing to be crowned \u201cthe Queen of Great Britain\u201d. Guest judges include Graham Norton, Maisie Williams, Cheryl, Alan Carr, Stacey Dooley, Andrew Garfield, Michaela Coel, Lorraine Kelly and Twiggy, alongside stalwart Michelle Visage. Self-empowering positivity and upbeat bubblegum camp have rarely been more needed. They better werk. MH Architecture: Open House weekend London\u2019s annual Open House weekend (21-22 September) always delivers an embarrassment of architectural riches, providing free access to more than 800 buildings usually off limits to the public, accompanied by a programme of tours and talks. Where else can you take in Lambeth Palace and the Marx Memorial Library in a single weekend? Marking the centenary of the Addison Act, which made \u201chousing for all\u201d a government policy, some of London\u2019s key postwar housing schemes will also open their doors for the first time. They include Alexandra Road in Camden, the Golden Lane Estate and Ern\u00f6 Goldfinger\u2019s twin monuments to brutalism, Trellick Tower and Balfron Tower. Other London landmarks, such as the BT Tower and 10 Downing Street, will be available to visit by online ballot. Catherine Slessor Theatre: tasty American imports Branden Jacob-Jenkins \u2013 who has had hits here with An Octoroon and Gloria \u2013 brings his 2014 play Appropriate to the Donmar until 5 October (see review, page 40). The Lafayette family return to their late father\u2019s house, a former plantation in Arkansas \u2013 and this, being a Jacob-Jenkins play, is a slanted, subversive take on the classic American family drama. It\u2019s directed by Ola Ince (The Convert), and stars Monica Dolan. There\u2019s more family feuding in Fairview \u2013 which won Jackie Sibblies Drury this year\u2019s Pulitzer prize for drama, and which promises to rip the genre to shreds. At London\u2019s Young Vic from 28 November, directed by Nadia Latif, this race drama should provoke, unsettle and dazzle audiences here too. Annie Baker is back at the National Theatre \u2013 which staged her hugely acclaimed plays John and The Flick \u2013 with The Antipodes, in which people sit around a table, telling, examining, and categorising stories. Intriguingly, Baker herself co-directs with Chloe Lamford, who is also designing the show (21 October-23 November). HW",

      "body": "<p>\u201cWhy are women, who have the whole male world at their mercy, not funny?\u201d It\u2019s only 12 years since Christopher Hitchens winsomely, question-beggingly <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2007/01/hitchens200701\" title=\"\">posed the query in </a><em><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2007/01/hitchens200701\" title=\"\">Vanity Fair</a></em>. Then it seemed daft. Now it seems antique. In part because of the glory that is <strong><a href=\"https://sohotheatre.com/shows/fleabag-wyndhams-theatre/\" title=\"\">Fleabag</a></strong>.</p> <p>In unleashing her stories six years ago on the stage at the Edinburgh fringe, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/sep/08/phoebe-waller-bridge-fleabag-killing-eve-transgressive-women\" title=\"\">Phoebe Waller-Bridge</a> created a person \u2013 unvictimised and vulnerable, comic and desperate, richly observant and blindly batting around \u2013 who remade the idea of the female voice, and showed comedy as multifaceted expression. Now, after telly triumph, she is back on stage, and it\u2019s hard to imagine a more brilliantly condensed hour-and-a-bit. Unadulterated bliss. A consummation devoutly to be wished...</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>She is as natural here as on the small screen \u2013 yet both magnified and more internal</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Waller-Bridge is the only person on stage: red jumper, black jeans, hair semi-up but with a straggling I\u2019m-louche-and-available lock. She is, though, accompanied in Vicky Jones\u2019s production by a reverberating soundscape designed by her sister, Isobel Waller-Bridge: its slamming doors and crunching bones (aaagh!) help to make the evening more than a standup (well mostly sit-down, actually) turn. This is a single-person event that squeezes a singular vision \u2013 much better written than most plays \u2013 on to the stage.</p> <p>Not all episodes are here: there will be disappointment for those hungering for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/feb/16/andrew-scott-fleabag-sexy-priest-uncharted-territory\" title=\"\">the sexy priest</a>. But here is the girl lolling drunk on the Northern Line; her mother\u2019s double mastectomy; the boyfriend who complacently pats his paunch; the masturbating to the porn channel; the death of her best friend, tangled in bicycles; the guinea pig-themed cafe. Some moments \u2013 several involving the guinea pig called Hilary \u2013 will be fresh and painful even to devotees. And a crucial piece of information, casually dropped late on, rearranges the whole evening from humorous lament (Waller-Bridge\u2019s voice has a dying fall) into laceration.</p> <p>She is as natural here as on the small screen \u2013 yet both magnified and more internal. Elliot Griggs\u2019s lighting makes her face gloriously apparent. Weaponised eyes flick at her sister. Eyebrows swivel up her forehead as if they are about to take off. When she meets <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/aug/10/jamie-demetriou-interview-fleabag-stath-lets-flats\" title=\"\">Rodent</a> \u2013 the fellow with the vanishing mouth \u2013 you see her own lips suckering down like an anus. And yes the arsehole joke \u2013 preceded by a long pause which rolls knowingly around the audience \u2013 is here. She is a gifted mime, corkscrewing her body in order to get a shot of her vagina for a requested sext, or to show how her mother claimed her big breasts got in the way of opening the fridge door. She is, among other things, an ad for innovation on stage.</p> <p>I have seen two plays by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/jun/03/branden-jacobs-jenkins-an-octoroon-interview\" title=\"\">Branden Jacobs-Jenkins</a>: both forceful, both funny, both examining slavery and racism. Each is remarkable. But put them together and you have something else: the beginning (Jacob-Jenkins is 34) of a body of work in which a dramatist tackles a subject of fundamental importance from different angles, bending the shape of his plays, squinnying from completely different viewpoints. Actually, these dramas don\u2019t so much argue with each other as punch each other in the face. The truth is in the bruises.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b7e1b0aeb5d02e88a5f340caa1e6901fb98bcff1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b7e1b0aeb5d02e88a5f340caa1e6901fb98bcff1/0_0_3750_2500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Monica Dolan, Steven Mackintosh and Edward Hogg in Appropriate at the Donmar Warehouse.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Monica Dolan, Steven Mackintosh and Edward Hogg in Appropriate at the Donmar Warehouse.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marc Brenner</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After the electrifiying experimentalism of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jun/24/fly-by-night-lift-notes-from-the-field-an-octoroon-phobiarama-theatre-reviews-susannah-clapp\" title=\"\">An Octoroon</a></em>, first seen in Britain at the Orange Tree, Richmond, two years ago \u2013 in which actors were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/may/26/an-octoroon-review-orange-tree-richmond-branden-jacobs-jenkins\" title=\"\">whited and redded up</a> and chronology was chopped \u2013 Jacobs-Jenkins turns to stalwart American dramatic territory. In <strong><a href=\"https://www.donmarwarehouse.com/production/7188/appropriate\" title=\"\">Appropriate</a></strong>, the variously troubled members of a white family yell at each other in a big house. The play \u2013 as sturdy as the family setup is rickety \u2013 pivots on a secret: was a supposedly upright patriarch, now dead, actually a vicious racist? The trigger of the plot \u2013 the discovery of a terrifying photo album \u2013 is deftly set up: the book causes a different disturbance each time it\u2019s passed from hand to hand. Meanwhile, lights go on and off without the touch of a human hand; there are \u2013 possibly \u2013 strange noises from what is \u2013 possibly \u2013 a slaves\u2019 graveyard. And Donato Wharton\u2019s soundscape stars a chorus of screaming cicadas.</p> <p>Other mysteries and secrets are less gothic but far-reaching. A financially savvy brother is under financial threat; another is in thrall to confession, as he has been to drugs and paedophilia. And the sister who has looked after dodgy dad is convulsed with the necessity of not allowing him to be impugned. Monica Dolan gives the performance of the evening: bunched up with the fear and anger that propel her around the stage, she watches herself become hateful and hated.</p> <p>Fly Davis\u2019s striking design suggests the unusual, wave-like movement of the play: from chaos through tightened-up chic to dramatic disintegration. Ola Ince, a new directorial light who directed a marvellously expansive production of <em>The Convert</em>, points up casually original moments: when, murmuring deeply, a woman teases her fellow\u2019s hair into a man-bun; when a child appears, looking for a moment comical, then frightening, to reveal the truth of his grandaddy\u2019s history. The switch between humour and alarm is key for Jacobs-Jenkins. His \u2013 yet-to-come \u2013 great play will thoroughly fuse the two.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c147d819fde18cf6ee0afa0ab7aac9c942664465\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c147d819fde18cf6ee0afa0ab7aac9c942664465/0_0_5874_3921/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The cast of As You Like It.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Alluring and changeable\u2019: As You Like It.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Camilla Greenwell</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Douglas Rintoul\u2019s production of <strong><a href=\"https://www.queens-theatre.co.uk/whats-on/show/as-you-like-it/\" title=\"\">As You Like It</a></strong> is the second <a href=\"https://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/about-the-national-theatre/our-national-work/public-acts\" title=\"\">Public Acts</a> staging, in which professional actors are brought together with a huge cast drawn from eight different UK organisations, among them a hip-hop dance company and a gospel choir.

When the chorus members fill the stage with their praise of Arden they do a rare thing: make celebration seem not just like a declamatory audition but an urgent statement.</p> <p>Hayley Grindle\u2019s design ripples the stage with multicoloured, glittering ribbons \u2013 Arden is as it should be, both alluring and changeable. Shaina Taub\u2019s music and lyrics shimmer from rap to pop.

      "bodyText": "\u201cWhy are women, who have the whole male world at their mercy, not funny?\u201d It\u2019s only 12 years since Christopher Hitchens winsomely, question-beggingly posed the query in Vanity Fair. Then it seemed daft. Now it seems antique. In part because of the glory that is Fleabag. In unleashing her stories six years ago on the stage at the Edinburgh fringe, Phoebe Waller-Bridge created a person \u2013 unvictimised and vulnerable, comic and desperate, richly observant and blindly batting around \u2013 who remade the idea of the female voice, and showed comedy as multifaceted expression. Now, after telly triumph, she is back on stage, and it\u2019s hard to imagine a more brilliantly condensed hour-and-a-bit. Unadulterated bliss. A consummation devoutly to be wished... Waller-Bridge is the only person on stage: red jumper, black jeans, hair semi-up but with a straggling I\u2019m-louche-and-available lock. She is, though, accompanied in Vicky Jones\u2019s production by a reverberating soundscape designed by her sister, Isobel Waller-Bridge: its slamming doors and crunching bones (aaagh!) help to make the evening more than a standup (well mostly sit-down, actually) turn. This is a single-person event that squeezes a singular vision \u2013 much better written than most plays \u2013 on to the stage. Not all episodes are here: there will be disappointment for those hungering for the sexy priest. But here is the girl lolling drunk on the Northern Line; her mother\u2019s double mastectomy; the boyfriend who complacently pats his paunch; the masturbating to the porn channel; the death of her best friend, tangled in bicycles; the guinea pig-themed cafe. Some moments \u2013 several involving the guinea pig called Hilary \u2013 will be fresh and painful even to devotees. And a crucial piece of information, casually dropped late on, rearranges the whole evening from humorous lament (Waller-Bridge\u2019s voice has a dying fall) into laceration. She is as natural here as on the small screen \u2013 yet both magnified and more internal. Elliot Griggs\u2019s lighting makes her face gloriously apparent. Weaponised eyes flick at her sister. Eyebrows swivel up her forehead as if they are about to take off. When she meets Rodent \u2013 the fellow with the vanishing mouth \u2013 you see her own lips suckering down like an anus. And yes the arsehole joke \u2013 preceded by a long pause which rolls knowingly around the audience \u2013 is here. She is a gifted mime, corkscrewing her body in order to get a shot of her vagina for a requested sext, or to show how her mother claimed her big breasts got in the way of opening the fridge door. She is, among other things, an ad for innovation on stage. I have seen two plays by Branden Jacobs-Jenkins: both forceful, both funny, both examining slavery and racism. Each is remarkable. But put them together and you have something else: the beginning (Jacob-Jenkins is 34) of a body of work in which a dramatist tackles a subject of fundamental importance from different angles, bending the shape of his plays, squinnying from completely different viewpoints. Actually, these dramas don\u2019t so much argue with each other as punch each other in the face. The truth is in the bruises. After the electrifiying experimentalism of An Octoroon, first seen in Britain at the Orange Tree, Richmond, two years ago \u2013 in which actors were whited and redded up and chronology was chopped \u2013 Jacobs-Jenkins turns to stalwart American dramatic territory. In Appropriate, the variously troubled members of a white family yell at each other in a big house. The play \u2013 as sturdy as the family setup is rickety \u2013 pivots on a secret: was a supposedly upright patriarch, now dead, actually a vicious racist? The trigger of the plot \u2013 the discovery of a terrifying photo album \u2013 is deftly set up: the book causes a different disturbance each time it\u2019s passed from hand to hand. Meanwhile, lights go on and off without the touch of a human hand; there are \u2013 possibly \u2013 strange noises from what is \u2013 possibly \u2013 a slaves\u2019 graveyard. And Donato Wharton\u2019s soundscape stars a chorus of screaming cicadas. Other mysteries and secrets are less gothic but far-reaching. A financially savvy brother is under financial threat; another is in thrall to confession, as he has been to drugs and paedophilia. And the sister who has looked after dodgy dad is convulsed with the necessity of not allowing him to be impugned. Monica Dolan gives the performance of the evening: bunched up with the fear and anger that propel her around the stage, she watches herself become hateful and hated. Fly Davis\u2019s striking design suggests the unusual, wave-like movement of the play: from chaos through tightened-up chic to dramatic disintegration. Ola Ince, a new directorial light who directed a marvellously expansive production of The Convert, points up casually original moments: when, murmuring deeply, a woman teases her fellow\u2019s hair into a man-bun; when a child appears, looking for a moment comical, then frightening, to reveal the truth of his grandaddy\u2019s history. The switch between humour and alarm is key for Jacobs-Jenkins. His \u2013 yet-to-come \u2013 great play will thoroughly fuse the two. Douglas Rintoul\u2019s production of As You Like It is the second Public Acts staging, in which professional actors are brought together with a huge cast drawn from eight different UK organisations, among them a hip-hop dance company and a gospel choir. After last year\u2019s Pericles, it has some of the best chorus work \u2013 variegated but united \u2013 I\u2019ve seen in the theatre since I went to Chickenshed a year ago. When the chorus members fill the stage with their praise of Arden they do a rare thing: make celebration seem not just like a declamatory audition but an urgent statement. Hayley Grindle\u2019s design ripples the stage with multicoloured, glittering ribbons \u2013 Arden is as it should be, both alluring and changeable. Shaina Taub\u2019s music and lyrics shimmer from rap to pop. I wish more of Shakespeare\u2019s lines had been included and that the central figure of Jaques \u2013 beautifully played by Beth Hinton-Lever \u2013 was not obliged to deliver the \u201call the world\u2019s a stage\u201d speech, however ingeniously, as a statement about inclusivity. Still it\u2019s a production that reaches out and takes you in. Hard to say that is not as you like it.

Marginally less awkward was recent guest <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/nicola-sturgeon\" title=\"\">Nicola Sturgeon</a>, who was clearly uncomfortable when asked about women in leadership and seemed keen to point out that it was a bit like men in leadership \u2013 some of them are crap.

We live our party lives through Janet Street-Porter. I think the public like that as well, because you\u2019re letting them into that world that they might not usually have an insight into. So when Janet comes on and goes, \u2018I was round at Elton\u2019s last night,\u2019 I always go to her, \u2018Dear God, [and at this Andrea joins Coleen and they chant in unison] <em>have you got any normal friends?</em>\u2019\u201d</p> <p>While there are younger hosts, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2012/mar/08/stacey-solomon-cigarette-mum-year\" title=\"\">Stacey Solomon</a> and a couple of potential new girls from <em>Love Island</em>, <em>Loose Women</em> is a rare celebration of older women, with more over-50s on it than probably any other telly programme. Today\u2019s hosts are all middle-aged mothers, but Janet is 72, with no children, while Gloria Hunniford is nearly 80. One rule is that you have to be prepared to air your dirty laundry in public, something that partners and offspring are not always happy about. Coleen, who began on the show after her divorce from Shane Richie, had to tell her second husband Ray Fensome \u201cthat it\u2019s what I do and it\u2019s what the show\u2019s about, and if you can\u2019t handle it, then off you pop. So he did.\u201d The show has outlived many of their marriages.</p> <p>Two weeks after I meet them, Nadia discusses, live on air, her stormy relationship with sister Julia Sawalha (who played Saffy in <em>Absolutely Fabulous</em>) and Julia retaliates on Twitter, saying she is sick of Nadia \u201cdestroying our family\u201d by discussing them on <em>Loose Women</em>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We break open the subjects people tend to keep to themselves</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Brenda tells me she doesn\u2019t like discussing politics. She did once manage to say on air that she supports bringing back the death penalty, but she got into more trouble for saying she leaves her cat alone for five days when she goes on holiday. She has trouble reining in her swearing, but always manages, \u201cbecause my children are watching and it\u2019s not right.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe talks about her children as if they\u2019re five and six,\u201d Coleen interjects. Why, how old are they, Brenda? Brenda looks a bit sheepish now: \u201c28 and 25. But I don\u2019t swear in front of them! I always say you\u2019ve got to lead by example.\u201d</p> <p>One thing the women all agree on is that the work they do is important. They claim it is \u201ca big deal to sit in those seats\u201d, because they help people at home feel less alone. For example, on today\u2019s show, they discuss the loneliness of raising a teenager, the time where, as Nadia put it, \u201cYour child doesn\u2019t fancy you any more,\u201d and they get such a big response in the hour after it airs that they decide to develop the topic further tomorrow. Nadia remembers a similar response when she revealed she had put her miscarriage in the freezer.</p> <p>Wait, what? \u201cOh, they were laughing at me in the meeting room, where we discuss all the things we want to talk about, but when I had a miscarriage I didn\u2019t know what to do with it. And loads of people have since told me that they felt really bad about it, but they secretly put theirs in the freezer, too. We get people literally sobbing with relief and gratitude that someone has said the unsayable. And that\u2019s what you can normally count on us to do \u2013 being an older woman with life experience is a plus on this show. It\u2019s just breaking open those subjects that people are keeping to themselves. I think that\u2019s a really important part of what we do. We\u2019re not TV presenters, we\u2019re not like\u2026\u201d she pretends to be a purring cat and does a sexy voice, \u201c\u2018Heeere I am, <em>licking </em>myself.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>I ask if there is an assumption that a show with four women sitting in a row has to be trivial. They say yes. \u201cOne of our pet hates,\u201d says Andrea, \u201cis that four feisty, intelligent women having different and contrary, very strong opinions \u2013 that somehow that is a slagging match, or a catfight.\u201d Nadia wonders if men coming off a debating show such as <em>Newsnight</em> would ever be asked if the argument was going to carry on afterwards. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what we really want to change. I swear to you on the lives of my children, we come off and go, \u2018Ooh that was a bit\u2026 wasn\u2019t it?\u2019 and then we go, \u2018Have you ordered the lentil soup, don\u2019t forget to ask for the yogurt on the top.\u2019 Does anyone ever say to Piers [Morgan], \u2018Oh are you upset after you\u2019ve done this and done that?\u2019 Nobody would think of it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ab4bd26f75671b5e1a7a87eab9219f7c8df706a5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ab4bd26f75671b5e1a7a87eab9219f7c8df706a5/0_1728_3840_2304/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brenda Edwards seen in the mirror of her dressing room as she puts a clip in her hair\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mirror mirror: Brenda Edwards gets ready.

McGiffin is white, has repeatedly defended Donald Trump, and told fellow panellists <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/apr/18/nadia-sawalha-my-family-values\" title=\"\">Nadia Sawalha</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/sep/03/saira-khan-my-family-values\" title=\"\">Saira Khan</a>, who are of Jordanian and Pakistani descent respectively, that the US president telling four American congresswomen of colour to \u201cgo back home\u201d was fine. Surely they were sitting there looking at her and thinking: \u201cYou\u2019ve never been told to go home like that, you don\u2019t know what racism is.\u201d</p> <p>Sawalha says she did talk more about that one with her husband when she got home. \u201cIt was such a strong view that she came out with. But I think the world is just so fragile at the moment, because we are all scared of our opinions. There are not many people who would sit on the television and say what Carol said in the way that she said it. So I was excited about that show.\u201d</p> <p>Is that because McGiffin brought to light what a lot of people were thinking but not saying? \u201cYes. And if we pander to the keyboard warriors, then we\u2019ve got a really scary world and it\u2019s not right. You have to talk it out, you can\u2019t keep avoiding it because you\u2019re scared of the response.\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>After the episode</strong></em> is broadcast I go backstage and wait for the panellists to return from a meeting. It takes longer than expected, so by the time they walk in I\u2019ve got a bit too comfortable and am peering at my bum in the mirror, trying to work out if I\u2019ve got cellulite, after the women themselves showed their squidgy bums on the show.</p> <p>Nadia and Andrea walk in on me and gasp \u2013 not because my skirt is hitched up over my knickers, which seems perfectly normal round here, but because I didn\u2019t already know if I had cellulite or not. Hadn\u2019t I checked before? I have to confess I hadn\u2019t, explaining that I don\u2019t really worry about body stuff at all, but feel a bit weird admitting it. At this, Nadia grabs a passing producer in the corridor and yanks her into the room. \u201cWe could do this on the show! Sophie here is ashamed of <em>not</em> being ashamed! She doesn\u2019t have any body positivity issues, but she feels she should!\u201d It gets jotted down as a possible subject for a future show \u2013 the untapped area of women secretly feeling embarrassed about not feeling embarrassed \u2013 and I realise my work here is done: I\u2019ve followed that nice man\u2019s instructions and accidentally become the fifth Loose Woman.</p> <p><em>Loose Women is on weekdays at 12.30pm on ITV</em></p>",

Coleen, who began on the show after her divorce from Shane Richie, had to tell her second husband Ray Fensome \u201cthat it\u2019s what I do and it\u2019s what the show\u2019s about, and if you can\u2019t handle it, then off you pop. So he did.\u201d The show has outlived many of their marriages. Two weeks after I meet them, Nadia discusses, live on air, her stormy relationship with sister Julia Sawalha (who played Saffy in Absolutely Fabulous) and Julia retaliates on Twitter, saying she is sick of Nadia \u201cdestroying our family\u201d by discussing them on Loose Women. Brenda tells me she doesn\u2019t like discussing politics. She did once manage to say on air that she supports bringing back the death penalty, but she got into more trouble for saying she leaves her cat alone for five days when she goes on holiday. She has trouble reining in her swearing, but always manages, \u201cbecause my children are watching and it\u2019s not right.\u201d \u201cShe talks about her children as if they\u2019re five and six,\u201d Coleen interjects. Why, how old are they, Brenda? Brenda looks a bit sheepish now: \u201c28 and 25. But I don\u2019t swear in front of them! I always say you\u2019ve got to lead by example.\u201d One thing the women all agree on is that the work they do is important. They claim it is \u201ca big deal to sit in those seats\u201d, because they help people at home feel less alone. For example, on today\u2019s show, they discuss the loneliness of raising a teenager, the time where, as Nadia put it, \u201cYour child doesn\u2019t fancy you any more,\u201d and they get such a big response in the hour after it airs that they decide to develop the topic further tomorrow. Nadia remembers a similar response when she revealed she had put her miscarriage in the freezer. Wait, what? \u201cOh, they were laughing at me in the meeting room, where we discuss all the things we want to talk about, but when I had a miscarriage I didn\u2019t know what to do with it. And loads of people have since told me that they felt really bad about it, but they secretly put theirs in the freezer, too. We get people literally sobbing with relief and gratitude that someone has said the unsayable. And that\u2019s what you can normally count on us to do \u2013 being an older woman with life experience is a plus on this show. It\u2019s just breaking open those subjects that people are keeping to themselves. I think that\u2019s a really important part of what we do. We\u2019re not TV presenters, we\u2019re not like\u2026\u201d she pretends to be a purring cat and does a sexy voice, \u201c\u2018Heeere I am, licking myself.\u2019\u201d I ask if there is an assumption that a show with four women sitting in a row has to be trivial. They say yes. \u201cOne of our pet hates,\u201d says Andrea, \u201cis that four feisty, intelligent women having different and contrary, very strong opinions \u2013 that somehow that is a slagging match, or a catfight.\u201d Nadia wonders if men coming off a debating show such as Newsnight would ever be asked if the argument was going to carry on afterwards. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what we really want to change. I swear to you on the lives of my children, we come off and go, \u2018Ooh that was a bit\u2026 wasn\u2019t it?\u2019 and then we go, \u2018Have you ordered the lentil soup, don\u2019t forget to ask for the yogurt on the top.\u2019 Does anyone ever say to Piers [Morgan], \u2018Oh are you upset after you\u2019ve done this and done that?\u2019 Nobody would think of it.\u201d I take their point, but a recent discussion with Carol McGiffin, who is not here today, must have stung. McGiffin is white, has repeatedly defended Donald Trump, and told fellow panellists Nadia Sawalha and Saira Khan, who are of Jordanian and Pakistani descent respectively, that the US president telling four American congresswomen of colour to \u201cgo back home\u201d was fine. Surely they were sitting there looking at her and thinking: \u201cYou\u2019ve never been told to go home like that, you don\u2019t know what racism is.\u201d Sawalha says she did talk more about that one with her husband when she got home. \u201cIt was such a strong view that she came out with. But I think the world is just so fragile at the moment, because we are all scared of our opinions. There are not many people who would sit on the television and say what Carol said in the way that she said it. So I was excited about that show.\u201d Is that because McGiffin brought to light what a lot of people were thinking but not saying? \u201cYes. And if we pander to the keyboard warriors, then we\u2019ve got a really scary world and it\u2019s not right. You have to talk it out, you can\u2019t keep avoiding it because you\u2019re scared of the response.\u201d After the episode is broadcast I go backstage and wait for the panellists to return from a meeting. It takes longer than expected, so by the time they walk in I\u2019ve got a bit too comfortable and am peering at my bum in the mirror, trying to work out if I\u2019ve got cellulite, after the women themselves showed their squidgy bums on the show. Nadia and Andrea walk in on me and gasp \u2013 not because my skirt is hitched up over my knickers, which seems perfectly normal round here, but because I didn\u2019t already know if I had cellulite or not. Hadn\u2019t I checked before? I have to confess I hadn\u2019t, explaining that I don\u2019t really worry about body stuff at all, but feel a bit weird admitting it. At this, Nadia grabs a passing producer in the corridor and yanks her into the room. \u201cWe could do this on the show! Sophie here is ashamed of not being ashamed! She doesn\u2019t have any body positivity issues, but she feels she should!\u201d It gets jotted down as a possible subject for a future show \u2013 the untapped area of women secretly feeling embarrassed about not feeling embarrassed \u2013 and I realise my work here is done: I\u2019ve followed that nice man\u2019s instructions and accidentally become the fifth Loose Woman. Loose Women is on weekdays at 12.30pm on ITV",

By leaking to the Observer details of a secret American dirty tricks campaign to spy on the UN before the invasion of Iraq, Katharine Gun hoped she could stir the public\u2019s conscience, ratcheting up political pressure to the point that conflict could be avoided. It was not, and Gun, then a 28-year-old working for GCHQ, the government\u2019s eavesdropping centre in Cheltenham, was later charged with breaking the Official Secrets Act. The case against her, however, was abruptly and mysteriously dropped. Now, before the release of a new film charting one of the most explosive episodes of the run-up to the invasion, the former director of public prosecutions has explained for the first time why he suddenly abandoned the case against Gun. Sir Ken Macdonald told the Observer he had realised that it would be impossible to give the whistleblower a fair trial without also risking national security. Gun \u201ccould only get a fair trial if we disclosed material to the defence that would compromise national security,\u201d he said. Previously the government has said that the decision was taken \u201csolely on legal grounds\u201d, but failed to explain why the prosecution elected to offer no evidence during her trial. Macdonald\u2019s reference to secret material prompted calls for the documents to be declassified and the specific reason for dropping the case made public.

      "bodyText": "China and the United States have begun imposing additional tariffs on each other\u2019s goods in the latest escalation of their bruising trade war that has sent shockwaves through the global economy. A new round of tariffs took effect from 0401 GMT on Sunday, with Beijing\u2019s levy of 5% on US crude oil marking the first time the fuel has been targeted since the world\u2019s two largest economies started their trade war more than a year ago. The Trump administration will begin collecting 15% tariffs on more than $125bn in Chinese imports, including smart speakers, Bluetooth headphones and many types of footwear. In retaliation, China started to impose additional tariffs on some of the US goods on a $75bn target list. Beijing did not specify the value of the goods that face higher tariffs from Sunday. The extra tariffs of 5% and 10% were levied on 1,717 items of a total of 5,078 products originating from the United States. Beijing will start collecting additional tariffs on the rest from 15 December. The new round of tariffs promises more volatility when stock markets resume trading on Monday, although Wall Street is closed for the Labor day holiday. Independent Australian market strategist, Greg McKenna, said that market concerns had been repeatedly soothed by conciliatory words from Beijing and Washington. But he said reality could begin to bite with Sunday\u2019s new round of tariffs. \u201cAll the while the tariffs are actually being imposed and the global growth, earnings, and interest rate cycles are pointing down again,\u201d he said. \u201cOn top of that, the inverted US yield curve suggests to many that at best the US economy is slowing materially and at worst that the recession count down has begun.\u201d The trade tariffs on China have contributed a slowing of the Chinese economy, as well as other countries\u2019 economies in the region. A snapshot of the country\u2019s giant manufacturing sector released on Saturday showed that activity contracted for the fourth month in succession in August. The Chinese yuan has also come under pressure and fell to an 11-year low against the US dollar last week. South Korea said on Sunday that its exports had fallen for the ninth month in a row. But Chinese state media struck a defiant note on Sunday. \u201cThe United States should learn how to behave like a responsible global power and stop acting as a \u2018school bully\u2019,\u201d the official Xinhua news agency said. \u201cAs the world\u2019s only superpower, it needs to shoulder its due responsibility, and join other countries in making this world a better and more prosperous place. Only then can America become great again.\u201d Tariffs could not impede China\u2019s development, said the official People\u2019s Daily of the ruling Communist Party. \u201cChina\u2019s booming economy has made China a fertile ground for investment that foreign companies cannot ignore,\u201d it said, in a commentary under the name Zhong Sheng, or \u201cVoice of China\u201d, which is often used to state its view on foreign policy issues. Last month, Donald Trump said he was imposing tariffs on $300bn worth of Chinese imports previously spared in the trade dispute. Some of the tariffs were later delayed until December in a concession to US retailers. Tariffs of 15% on cellphones, laptop computers, toys and clothing are to take effect on December 15. The president has also announced that existing 25% tariffs on a separate group of $250 billion of Chinese imports will increase to 30% on 1 October. Once all the measures have taken effect by December, nearly all of China\u2019s $540bn worth of exports to the US will be subject to the levies. The US trade representative\u2019s office said on Thursday it would collect public comments until 20 September on a planned tariff increase to 30% on a $250bn list of goods already hit with a 25% tariff. Trade teams from China and the United States continue to talk and will meet this month, but tariff hikes on Chinese goods set to go in place on Sunday will not be delayed, Trump has said. For two years, the Trump administration has sought to pressure China to make sweeping changes to its policies on intellectual property protection, forced transfers of technology to Chinese firms, industrial subsidies and market access. China has consistently denied Washington\u2019s accusations that it engages in unfair trade practices, vowing to fight back in kind and criticising US measures as protectionist.

      "body": "<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a bizarre phenomenon,\u201d says the US photographer Gregory Halpern. \u201cPeople take these junkyard cars and fix them up so that the engine works, even though the shell is a total wreck. Then the cars drive around in a muddy arena, spewing dirt everywhere and ramming into each other \u2013 and the last car still driving wins.\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019s talking about a very American motor sport called demolition derby, one of many striking activities he documented during his visits to Nebraska over the past 14 years. Halpern (born in Buffalo, New York state, in 1977) was invited to do an artist\u2019s residency in the state\u2019s largest city, Omaha. Taking photos of midwestern life over the course of six months, he gradually zeroed in on the subject of hypermasculinity, which he felt was \u201cmuch more celebrated and part of the visual culture in Nebraska\u201d than in coastal cities such as San Francisco, where he was teaching photography at the time.</p> <p>Out of the photos from his first visit, he created <em>Omaha Sketchbook</em>, self-published in 2009 using a laser printer and running to just 35 copies. Ten years and several return visits later, Halpern \u2013 who received a Guggenheim Fellowship in 2014 \u2013 has updated (and upgraded) <em>Omaha Sketchboo</em>k for a wider readership, though the images remain at contact-sheet dimensions.</p> <p>At the demolition derby, Halpern captured the winner standing triumphantly on the roof of his battered car as smoke spews out in all directions. It may look like something out of Mad Max but Halpern says the event felt \u201cgood-natured: the crowd is drinking and cheering.

      "bodyText": "\u201cIt\u2019s a bizarre phenomenon,\u201d says the US photographer Gregory Halpern. \u201cPeople take these junkyard cars and fix them up so that the engine works, even though the shell is a total wreck. Then the cars drive around in a muddy arena, spewing dirt everywhere and ramming into each other \u2013 and the last car still driving wins.\u201d He\u2019s talking about a very American motor sport called demolition derby, one of many striking activities he documented during his visits to Nebraska over the past 14 years. Halpern (born in Buffalo, New York state, in 1977) was invited to do an artist\u2019s residency in the state\u2019s largest city, Omaha. Taking photos of midwestern life over the course of six months, he gradually zeroed in on the subject of hypermasculinity, which he felt was \u201cmuch more celebrated and part of the visual culture in Nebraska\u201d than in coastal cities such as San Francisco, where he was teaching photography at the time. Out of the photos from his first visit, he created Omaha Sketchbook, self-published in 2009 using a laser printer and running to just 35 copies. Ten years and several return visits later, Halpern \u2013 who received a Guggenheim Fellowship in 2014 \u2013 has updated (and upgraded) Omaha Sketchbook for a wider readership, though the images remain at contact-sheet dimensions. At the demolition derby, Halpern captured the winner standing triumphantly on the roof of his battered car as smoke spews out in all directions. It may look like something out of Mad Max but Halpern says the event felt \u201cgood-natured: the crowd is drinking and cheering. Sometimes fights will break out, but generally speaking it\u2019s bizarrely fun\u201d. He expresses similar affection for midwestern life in all its eccentricities. \u201cThere were times when I felt on the outside, like I was witnessing something I didn\u2019t feel terribly comfortable about \u2013 such as young boys playing soldiers. But in moments like the demolition derby, I could be swept up in it and totally appreciate the fun.\u201d Omaha Sketchbook is published by Mack Books and will be launched at Tate Modern on 16 September, with Gregory Halpern in conversation.

Elsewhere, Charlotte Heywood (Rose Williams) joined the enthused Tom Parker (Kris Marshall) on his mission to make Sanditon a fashionable Sussex seaside resort, encountering, among others, Anne Reid\u2019s formidable Lady Denham, a woman well aware that certain people were manoeuvring for an inheritance (\u201cThere is one thing that they forget \u2013 I have no intention at all of dying\u201d); the seemingly incestuous Edward and Esther Denham (Charlotte Spencer); Austen\u2019s first black character, a West Indies heiress (Crystal Clarke); and the requisite brooding Austen hunk in the form of Sidney Parker (Theo James) \u2013 who of course ended up haughtily scolding Charlotte. \u201cMiss Heywood, you\u2019re very free with your opinions.\u201d Some might say that, thus far, Davies has been \u201cvery free\u201d with Jane Austen, but this opener was intriguing nonetheless. Now more than ever, The Great British Bake Off could be viewed as a floury manifestation of a collective national nervous breakdown. As in: \u201cThe real world is scary \u2013 let\u2019s obsess about cakes!\u201d In this sense, the pastel-hued tent represents sanctuary, while this year\u2019s 13 (\u201cbaker\u2019s dozen\u201d) contestants (noted as being on the young side for Bake Off\u2019s 10th anniversary outing) bake, crumble and stir in a gentler world where rubbery icing really matters. It still amuses me that a right-goth like Noel Fielding presents Bake Off (Fielding met his match in a goth contestant fashioning a cake fairy garden), along with Sandi Toksvig and experts Prue Leith and Paul Hollywood. Last week, a bloke with mega-pierced ears was sent home because Hollywood couldn\u2019t taste his tangy filling. Alas, life is cruel, even inside the Tent of Human Kindness. If Bafta-winning Mobeen Azhar set out to depress with his two-part documentary A Black and White Killing: The Case That Shook America, then he succeeded. When Russell Courtier ran over and killed black 19-year-old Larnell Bruce, after an altercation in Portland, Oregon, three years ago, the only remaining question was: was this a racially motivated crime? In prison, Courtier had become a member of white supremacist prison-gang European Kindred, but it also emerged that Bruce had been carrying a machete. Azhar followed the case through court, talking with, among others, relatives of the accused and the deceased. There were revelations \u2013 I didn\u2019t realise that uber-liberal Portland had such strong past links with the Ku Klux Klan. In the end, Courtier was found guilty of racially motivated murder, but there was no sense of triumph, just an abiding grimness. Throughout, Azhar used being British-Pakistani to smoke out racist interviewees. One man seemed more taken aback by Azhar having an English accent. Others seemed to relish exuding a chilly faux-friendliness that just made their bigotry even more obvious. The Affair returned for its fifth and final season, and not only is Alison (Ruth Wilson) dead (I still can\u2019t believe it), but key cast members are awol, not least the only truly likable one, Joshua Jackson as Alison\u2019s ex, Cole. I still like The Affair, despite (or maybe because of) the characters being such intolerable, self-absorbed whinge-bats. Dominic West is superb as flawed author Noah, a weak man prone to overplaying his strengths, as is Maura Tierney as his fuming, raddled former wife, Helen, now coping with the death of new love Vik (Omar Metwally) \u2013 even as the nextdoor neighbour has Vik\u2019s baby (you\u2019ve got to stay very alert for Affair plots). \u201cWhy him and not you?\u201d growled Helen at Noah, in one of those signature Affair scenes-from-different-perspectives. Elsewhere, there are little acid splashes of dialogue: \u201cHow nice to meet another one of Noah\u2019s women,\u201d says Helen\u2019s mum (Kathleen Chalfant) to his new partner (Sanaa Lathan). Interestingly, Anna Paquin (The Piano) features as Alison and Cole\u2019s daughter Joanie, but in scenes set years ahead in the future. Bad news: Joanie is as miserable as everybody else in The Affair. Good news: she\u2019s going to look into her mother\u2019s death. I\u2019m already hooked.",

As the sea retreats, people armed with rakes and shovels set out across the sand flats either side of the cobbled causeway connecting Noirmoutier island with the mainland. Hunched over the rippled sand, they fill baskets and buckets with cockles and clams. Others use penknives to prise oysters off the rocks and pop them straight into their children\u2019s mouths. One family offered our eight-year-old son an oyster, which he golloped down, declaring it delicious. For a moment we felt a little bit French.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/aug/2019-08-28T12:38:45.html\" data-alt=\"vendee map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/aug/2019-08-28T12:38:45.html\">vendee map</a> </figure>  <p>Until 1971, this causeway was the only link between the island and the mainland; now a bridge offers a safer, quicker crossing, but of course it\u2019s not as much fun. Nine wooden towers along the 2\u00bd-mile length of the causeway provide views \u2013 and refuge from the rising sea if you mistime your visit.</p> <p>To avoid getting stranded, we walked back on to the island as the tide turned and sat on a rocky slope watching the sand flats and road disappear under the water and wondering when the owners of a car parked on the causeway were going to return. As the sea started lapping around the tyres, they finally ran back and drove off in the nick of time, to cheers from us onlookers. It was a moment of drama on an island where very little happens.</p> <p>Noirmoutier is a flat, 16-mile-long island off the coast of the Vend\u00e9e. While \u00cele de R\u00e9, about 80 miles further south, has long been a place of second homes for Parisians and, increasingly, British holidaymakers, Noirmoutier has been mostly overlooked by Brits. Both islands are known for their seafood (particularly oysters) and cycling; both have sandy beaches and pretty villages. But where \u00cele de R\u00e9 has boutique hotels, chic shopping and high-end restaurants, Noirmoutier offers a lower-key experience.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"34c0df740d6bc81c053e3522c9a8922bdf790e35\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/34c0df740d6bc81c053e3522c9a8922bdf790e35/0_1111_3828_2297/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cycling across the Passage du Gois tidal causeway to Noirmoutier.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cycling across the Passage du Gois tidal causeway to Noirmoutier.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We stayed in a cabin at <a href=\"http://www.domaine-le-midi.com/\" title=\"\">Domaine Le Midi</a>, a campsite amid dunes by a long Atlantic-facing beach. It wasn\u2019t beach weather, so we hired bikes and set off to explore. The Vend\u00e9e has the largest network of cycle tracks in France and these extend to the island. We rode across the salt marshes where salt is still harvested in the traditional way and piled on the banks in little white mounds.</p> <p>Between the salt marshes and oyster farms was Chez P\u2019tit Louis, a seafood shack where we devoured two dozen oysters (\u20ac16) between us. Salt farming declined at the end of the 20th century but now a new generation of artisan producers are using traditional methods to harvest the \u201cwhite gold\u201d. On our way back we stopped off at one of many wooden huts advertising salt and stocked up on little linen bags of <em>fleur de sel</em>, the delicate flakes that form on the surface of seawater.</p> <p>The village of L\u2019\u00c9pine has a water park (<a href=\"https://www.oceanile.com/\" title=\"\">Oc\u00e9anile</a>) and there\u2019s a small aquarium (<a href=\"https://en.aquariumdenoirmoutier.com/\" title=\"\">Sealand</a>) at Noirmoutier-en-l\u2019\u00cele, and that\u2019s about it for attractions. Other than cycling, most activities revolve around the sea. The east coast is scalloped with sheltered beaches offering surfing, kayaking, sand yachting and sailing. We stuck to the simpler pleasures of sandcastle building by rows of smart white beach huts on Plage des Dames and peering into fishermen\u2019s buckets on the wooden pier.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3bb4a78812ff581c5d89871b18c580d00bcdc4f6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3bb4a78812ff581c5d89871b18c580d00bcdc4f6/0_0_3264_1958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A platter of oysters.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The island is famous for its oysters.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Isabel Choat</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As well as shellfish and salt, the island\u2019s other foodie claim to fame is the world\u2019s most expensive potato, the salty <em>bonnotte</em>. We saw them roasted whole in giant pans at the market in the village of Barb\u00e2tre. Local produce is also highlighted on the menu of La Marine, a two-Michelin-star harbourside restaurant in L\u2019Herbaudi\u00e8re, on the far western tip. Here, chef Alexandre Couillon turns whatever the boats bring in \u2013 sole, seabass, red mullet, lobster, spider crab \u2013 into beautiful dishes (four courses from \u20ac88). But Couillon and his wife also run a more affordable restaurant right next door. La Table d\u2019\u00c9lise shares a kitchen with La Marine but offers a three-course menu for \u20ac33. We ate in its pretty garden one night and were treated to chargrilled octopus, shellfish ravioli and red tuna with tapenade.</p> <p>Heading back to the mainland, we took in the craft village of Sallertaine on the way to eco-campsite <a href=\"https://www.loiseliere.com/camping/\" title=\"\">Domaine de l\u2019Oiseli\u00e8re</a>, arriving just as a local seller of biodynamic wines was setting up a stall offering tastings and platters of cheese and cured meats. The campsite, near the small town of Chauch\u00e9, is run by a brother-and-sister team who gave up jobs in aeronautics and hospitality respectively to set up an environment-friendly business in the area where they grew up.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"17237df16ab0e90f9a13e3250fe1a3815be26c3e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/17237df16ab0e90f9a13e3250fe1a3815be26c3e/0_125_3022_1813/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chez P\u2019tit Louis oyster shack.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chez P\u2019tit Louis oyster shack.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Isabel Choat</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The site has EU Ecolabel certification for its commitment to recycling, green products and low energy and water consumption. Big enough for spacious pitches but small enough for kids to run around freely, with a pool, free bike hire, organic grocery and restaurant, it\u2019s a pretty near perfect family campsite. And that\u2019s before you factor in its proximity to France\u2019s second most popular theme park.</p> <p>I had heard about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/may/06/puy-du-fou-theme-park-vendee-france\" title=\"\">Puy du Fou</a> but nothing prepared me for its scale and ambition. It was worth going for the bird show alone. Le Bal des Oiseaux Fant\u00f4mes (dance of the ghost birds) is an over-the-top half-hour of live storytelling involving a few actors and more than 300 birds of prey, released from various corners of an outdoor auditorium, often swooping just inches above the audience\u2019s heads. It\u2019s hard to put a finger on the most surprising bit of the show \u2013 the flock of vultures in among the falcons, eagles and owls, or perhaps the snake eagle dancing around a rubber snake. Probably my biggest \u201cwhat the heck?!\u201d moment came when more birds were released from a balloon tethered above us. By the end of the show the sky was filled with hundreds of birds, in what would be an ornithophobe\u2019s idea of hell, but is a highlight for the thousands who see the show every day.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d08d2b52bdeed508225352d7e8feea0780bd6c32\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d08d2b52bdeed508225352d7e8feea0780bd6c32/0_328_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Noirmoutier-en-l\u2019\u00cele\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Noirmoutier-en-l\u2019\u00cele.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The bird show is just one of six major daytime shows (there are also two evening ones). The spectacles can be five years in the making, sets can take a year to construct, and casts run into hundreds \u2013 human, mammal and avian. One of the most gobsmacking and, for some, uncomfortable sights is the opening parade in the 7,000-seater \u201cRoman arena\u201d (wild animals are allowed in French shows). First came 100 geese, led in formation around the arena. Two oxen followed, then 12 ostriches, their heads peeking out of a pen, a caged leopard and a trio of camels. Later a tiger stalked the edge of the arena and a white lion leapt on to a platform. Other wow moments included a flaming Viking ship and the knights of the round table rising from a lake. </p> <p>But even all this pales in comparison with the evening extravaganza, La Cin\u00e9sc\u00e9nie, which features nearly 2,500 actors and is the world\u2019s biggest nighttime show. Between the theatrics there are landscaped gardens and themed villages to explore, with more costumed actors busy bashing metal or sculpting wood.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2fdbad04db30f9ac5387dfb200c1b489a4c95228\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2fdbad04db30f9ac5387dfb200c1b489a4c95228/0_157_2400_1440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Phantom birds\u2019 dance, Puy du Fou, Vendee, France\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Puy du Fou\u2019s bird show involves about 300 birds of prey and storks.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The closest we have to it in the UK is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2017/jul/28/kynren-epic-tale-england-live-family-show-county-durham\" title=\"\">Kynren, the live action </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2017/jul/28/kynren-epic-tale-england-live-family-show-county-durham\" title=\"\">show</a> produced by the team behind Puy du Fou every summer at Bishop Auckland, County Durham.

A grand park is slated to open there in 2021 and four more parks across Europe are set to open by 2030.</p> <p>After Puy du Fou, the Vend\u00e9e\u2019s other attractions could seem a little underwhelming, but several castles tell their own grisly stories through reenactments. We spent a couple of afternoons at Ch\u00e2teau de Tiffauges and Ch\u00e2teau Saint-Mesmin, practising jousting and crossbow skills at the former and learning about medieval life at the latter.</p> <p>In the idyllic town of Clisson on the River S\u00e8vre, medieval France meets renaissance Italy. Its castle and 15th-century market hall are surrounded by terracotta roofs reminiscent of Tuscany, a legacy of early 19th-century sculptor Fran\u00e7ois-Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lemot, who had studied in Rome and designed the neo-classical mansion <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/garennelemot/\" title=\"\">Domaine de la Garenne Lemot</a>, now a museum and sculpture garden.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ce7e7978c4d0be3ff4eed643c4dd77786c4184d8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ce7e7978c4d0be3ff4eed643c4dd77786c4184d8/0_495_7360_4417/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Clisson (north-western France).

As well as shellfish and salt, the island\u2019s other foodie claim to fame is the world\u2019s most expensive potato, the salty bonnotte. We saw them roasted whole in giant pans at the market in the village of Barb\u00e2tre. Local produce is also highlighted on the menu of La Marine, a two-Michelin-star harbourside restaurant in L\u2019Herbaudi\u00e8re, on the far western tip. Here, chef Alexandre Couillon turns whatever the boats bring in \u2013 sole, seabass, red mullet, lobster, spider crab \u2013 into beautiful dishes (four courses from \u20ac88). But Couillon and his wife also run a more affordable restaurant right next door. La Table d\u2019\u00c9lise shares a kitchen with La Marine but offers a three-course menu for \u20ac33. We ate in its pretty garden one night and were treated to chargrilled octopus, shellfish ravioli and red tuna with tapenade. Heading back to the mainland, we took in the craft village of Sallertaine on the way to eco-campsite Domaine de l\u2019Oiseli\u00e8re, arriving just as a local seller of biodynamic wines was setting up a stall offering tastings and platters of cheese and cured meats. The campsite, near the small town of Chauch\u00e9, is run by a brother-and-sister team who gave up jobs in aeronautics and hospitality respectively to set up an environment-friendly business in the area where they grew up. The site has EU Ecolabel certification for its commitment to recycling, green products and low energy and water consumption. Big enough for spacious pitches but small enough for kids to run around freely, with a pool, free bike hire, organic grocery and restaurant, it\u2019s a pretty near perfect family campsite. And that\u2019s before you factor in its proximity to France\u2019s second most popular theme park. I had heard about Puy du Fou but nothing prepared me for its scale and ambition. It was worth going for the bird show alone. Le Bal des Oiseaux Fant\u00f4mes (dance of the ghost birds) is an over-the-top half-hour of live storytelling involving a few actors and more than 300 birds of prey, released from various corners of an outdoor auditorium, often swooping just inches above the audience\u2019s heads. It\u2019s hard to put a finger on the most surprising bit of the show \u2013 the flock of vultures in among the falcons, eagles and owls, or perhaps the snake eagle dancing around a rubber snake. Probably my biggest \u201cwhat the heck?!\u201d moment came when more birds were released from a balloon tethered above us. By the end of the show the sky was filled with hundreds of birds, in what would be an ornithophobe\u2019s idea of hell, but is a highlight for the thousands who see the show every day. The bird show is just one of six major daytime shows (there are also two evening ones). The spectacles can be five years in the making, sets can take a year to construct, and casts run into hundreds \u2013 human, mammal and avian. One of the most gobsmacking and, for some, uncomfortable sights is the opening parade in the 7,000-seater \u201cRoman arena\u201d (wild animals are allowed in French shows). First came 100 geese, led in formation around the arena. Two oxen followed, then 12 ostriches, their heads peeking out of a pen, a caged leopard and a trio of camels. Later a tiger stalked the edge of the arena and a white lion leapt on to a platform. Other wow moments included a flaming Viking ship and the knights of the round table rising from a lake. But even all this pales in comparison with the evening extravaganza, La Cin\u00e9sc\u00e9nie, which features nearly 2,500 actors and is the world\u2019s biggest nighttime show. Between the theatrics there are landscaped gardens and themed villages to explore, with more costumed actors busy bashing metal or sculpting wood. The closest we have to it in the UK is Kynren, the live action show produced by the team behind Puy du Fou every summer at Bishop Auckland, County Durham. On 30 August, Puy du Fou Espa\u00f1a opened in Toledo, central Spain, with an evening show. A grand park is slated to open there in 2021 and four more parks across Europe are set to open by 2030. After Puy du Fou, the Vend\u00e9e\u2019s other attractions could seem a little underwhelming, but several castles tell their own grisly stories through reenactments. We spent a couple of afternoons at Ch\u00e2teau de Tiffauges and Ch\u00e2teau Saint-Mesmin, practising jousting and crossbow skills at the former and learning about medieval life at the latter. In the idyllic town of Clisson on the River S\u00e8vre, medieval France meets renaissance Italy. Its castle and 15th-century market hall are surrounded by terracotta roofs reminiscent of Tuscany, a legacy of early 19th-century sculptor Fran\u00e7ois-Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lemot, who had studied in Rome and designed the neo-classical mansion Domaine de la Garenne Lemot, now a museum and sculpture garden. We only had a couple of hours in Clisson but it\u2019s a lovely spot. It\u2019s the last place on Earth you\u2019d expect to come across a gathering of heavy metal fans, but visit in late June and you\u2019ll spot posses of leather-clad rockers descending on a site just outside the town for Hellfest, a three-day hard rock extravaganza. Local winemakers take the chance to set up stalls and sell gallons of wine to 50,000 thirsty metalheads. It\u2019s such a fixture that there\u2019s a statue of Lemmy from Mot\u00f6rhead on a roundabout next to the site. Among the winegrowers who profit from Hellfest are the Paquereau family of Domaine de l\u2019\u00c9pinay, who, unusually for the area, also produce red, ros\u00e9 and sparkling wines as well as muscadet, the predominant grape of the Nantes area. We stopped for a tasting and to raise a glass to a region perfect for stepping back in time, whether it\u2019s on a small, sleepy island that\u2019s changed little in generations, or at a vast show with state-of-the art special effects. \u2022 The trip was arranged with help from Vend\u00e9e Tourism. Ferry travel was provided by Brittany Ferries, which sails from Portsmouth to St Malo from \u00a3377 return for a car and four people, including a cabin on one sailing. Domaine le Midi has tent pitches from \u20ac17 and cottages from \u20ac56 (two-night minimum). Domaine de L\u2019Oiseli\u00e8re has pitches from \u20ac22 a night and cottages from \u20ac77 a night.

It\u2019s been an interesting ride. At first, <em>The Clearing</em> seemed like a straightforward, cold-case podcast banger. The middle-aged daughter of a strange, controlling father wonders if he might have been a serial killer. She suggests him as a suspect for an unsolved double murder that\u2019s being re-investigated: turns out he\u2019s a perfect fit. <em>The Clearing</em>\u2019s starting point is the story of the daughter, April Balascio, and an experienced reporter, Josh Dean, trying to find out if her father committed any unsolved murders.</p> <p>Balascio remembers odd facts, strange occurrences. When she was young, her father would regularly decide to up and move the entire family for seemingly no reason. She made a timeline of where they were and when. Did it match any unsolved murders? Like I said: perfect podcast material. Especially as Balascio\u2019s father, Edward Wayne Edwards, appeared on a bonkers TV show in the 1970s (with actor Alan Alda).

(Edwards, now dead, has been spuriously linked with any number of murders, including that of child beauty queen JonBen\u00e9t Ramsey.)

In<em> </em><strong>Crossing Continents: Ka</strong><strong>zakhstan: Port in the Desert</strong>, the immensely engaging Rose Kudabayeva returned to her home country and its eastern frontier with China. The result was dreamy in its otherness, both modern and ancient, Kudabayeva talking to nomads, traders and rail workers on the new Silk Road.

However, it is only at the end of the term that borrowers will be able to look back and assess whether it was a good idea.</p> <p>\u201cLonger-term fixed rates do carry higher interest rates than their shorter-term counterparts so there is a cost for long-term stability. That price may be well worth paying, of course, if rates rise in future but will inevitably cause borrowers to consider whether they opt for a lower rate now and review in the future,\u201d says David Hollingworth of London and Country Mortgages.</p> <p>They are best suited to people who are in their \u201cforever homes\u201d and have no plans to leave and want to insulate themselves from risk, says Chris Sykes of Private Finance mortgage consultants. Those who want to move, however, may face problems.</p> <p>\u201cAlthough the majority of deals are portable \u2013 so they can be taken to a new property \u2013 there are no guarantees that the borrower will still meet the lender\u2019s criteria, or what rates would be available on any top-up borrowing that might be required,\u201d says Hollingworth.</p> <h2>Is there a sting in the tail?</h2> <p>Once you are in, it can be expensive to get out. Commentators have been quick to point out that the early repayment charges (ERCs) \u2013 fees for paying off the loan too early \u2013 can be very steep.</p> <p>\u201cMuch can happen in 15 years. Most borrowers are happier fixing for a shorter period, and as a nation we tend to remortgage every couple of years,\u201d says Adrian Anderson of brokers Anderson Harris.</p> <p>\u201cFive-year fixes are very popular and look good value compared with two years. Some borrowers are looking at 10 years but 15 years takes it that stage further.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cVirgin\u2019s 15-year fix also has high ERCs (8%) until 1 January 2025. On a \u00a3400,000 mortgage, this works out at \u00a332,000, which is a lot of money.\u201d</p> <p>In the case of a couple splitting up, this could result in a substantial cost at a difficult and emotional time. \u201cEven someone who expects to stay in their property may need to move for reasons completely unforeseeable, which is why ERCs are important; for example a significant minority of couples will split up during the 15 years and may have to sell,\u201d says Boulger.</p> <h2>What\u2019s next \u2013 a 20-year fix?<br></h2> <p>Fixed interest mortgages over 20 years are a feature of some European countries and Hollingworth says there have been terms of 25 years in the past.</p> <p>But if these longer terms do come in, so must more consumer-friendly terms, says Boulger. \u201cNow is an ideal time for lenders to look at offering a 20-year fix, or better still a 25- or 30-year. I expect to see terms longer than 15 years on offer by next year, but the longer the term the more important it will be for the ERCs to be consumer friendly,\u201d he says.</p> <h2>So should you sign up?<br></h2> <p>A long-term fixed mortgage is clearly not for everyone and may be most attractive to those seeking financial security, having found the home they will spend the rest of their lives in. But while the current low interest rates allow banks to offer such deals, they should also be used by consumers to settle their commitments early.</p> <p>Springall says: \u201cWhere possible, borrowers would be wise to take advantage of the low rates and attempt to overpay to build up more equity and reduce their mortgage term. Doing this can move borrowers into a lower loan-to-value bracket and enable them to find a cheaper mortgage which can lower their monthly repayments when they refinance.\u201d</p>",

Commentators have been quick to point out that the early repayment charges (ERCs) \u2013 fees for paying off the loan too early \u2013 can be very steep. \u201cMuch can happen in 15 years. Most borrowers are happier fixing for a shorter period, and as a nation we tend to remortgage every couple of years,\u201d says Adrian Anderson of brokers Anderson Harris. \u201cFive-year fixes are very popular and look good value compared with two years. Some borrowers are looking at 10 years but 15 years takes it that stage further.\u201d \u201cVirgin\u2019s 15-year fix also has high ERCs (8%) until 1 January 2025. On a \u00a3400,000 mortgage, this works out at \u00a332,000, which is a lot of money.\u201d In the case of a couple splitting up, this could result in a substantial cost at a difficult and emotional time. \u201cEven someone who expects to stay in their property may need to move for reasons completely unforeseeable, which is why ERCs are important; for example a significant minority of couples will split up during the 15 years and may have to sell,\u201d says Boulger. What\u2019s next \u2013 a 20-year fix? Fixed interest mortgages over 20 years are a feature of some European countries and Hollingworth says there have been terms of 25 years in the past. But if these longer terms do come in, so must more consumer-friendly terms, says Boulger. \u201cNow is an ideal time for lenders to look at offering a 20-year fix, or better still a 25- or 30-year. I expect to see terms longer than 15 years on offer by next year, but the longer the term the more important it will be for the ERCs to be consumer friendly,\u201d he says. So should you sign up? A long-term fixed mortgage is clearly not for everyone and may be most attractive to those seeking financial security, having found the home they will spend the rest of their lives in. But while the current low interest rates allow banks to offer such deals, they should also be used by consumers to settle their commitments early. Springall says: \u201cWhere possible, borrowers would be wise to take advantage of the low rates and attempt to overpay to build up more equity and reduce their mortgage term. Doing this can move borrowers into a lower loan-to-value bracket and enable them to find a cheaper mortgage which can lower their monthly repayments when they refinance.\u201d",

A stark example came last week when Trump delivered a bizarre 35-minute word salad about gun control, Russia, taxes, a recession, Greenland, disloyalty to Israel and the trade war with China (\u201cI am the chosen one\u201d). It is all yet another way in which Trump has rewritten rules of the presidency. Chris Whipple, author of The Gatekeepers: How the White House Chiefs of Staff Define Every Presidency, said: \u201cI don\u2019t think it serves anybody to have the president go out to deliver 35-minute rants on 20 different subjects. It looks as though they\u2019ve completely abandoned any pretence of trying to keep the president focused or on message. That\u2019s chief of staff malpractice. Is there anybody on the staff who can tell the president when he\u2019s unhinged?\u201d Whipple noted that when Ronald Reagan was president, helicopter noise was a useful way of keeping him on message: he would make remarks but not be able to hear questions that could lead him into gaffes. \u201cThe chief of staff got the helicopter to rev up the engine so Reagan couldn\u2019t hear questions,\u201d he said. \u201cOtherwise there was the danger he would answer questions they didn\u2019t want answered that day. If Mick Mulvaney [now acting chief of staff] had any sense, he would signal to the air force pilot to rev up the engine to drain Trump out.\u201d Mike McCurry, who was press secretary to former president Bill Clinton in the 1990s, said: \u201cThe job doesn\u2019t exist any more in the conventional way it did in the past because they don\u2019t have a briefing. The title doesn\u2019t really mean anything any more.\u201d Trump\u2019s chopper talk is no substitute, McCurry added. \u201cWhen you just go out and make shit up, that doesn\u2019t really count.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>In the flesh, Malcolm Gladwell is exactly as I imagined him to be: engaging, polite, dauntingly cerebral and supremely self-assured in that way that the exceptionally gifted often are. At 55, there is still something of the sporty, if slightly gawky, teenager about him; his jeans and a lightweight hoody accentuate his height and wiry thinness. The signature afro has been tamed somewhat and, if anything, makes him look even younger. He is not big on small talk, and one senses that every hour in his working day is geared towards maximum efficiency.</p> <p>Gladwell\u2019s new book is called <em>Talking to Strangers</em> and, here we are, two strangers, conversing over tea in a fashionable Covent Garden hotel about the difficulties that can sometimes arise when, as he puts it, \u201cwe are thrown into contact with people whose assumptions, perspectives and backgrounds are different from our own\u201d. Like the previous bestselling books that made his name \u2013 <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/tipping-point-2.html\" title=\"\"><em>The Tipping Point</em></a> (2000), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/feb/06/scienceandnature.society\" title=\"\"><em>Blink</em></a> (2005), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/nov/23/outliers-story-success-malcolm-gladwell\" title=\"\"><em>Outliers</em></a> (2008) \u2013 <em>Talking to Strangers</em> is essentially an exploration of human behaviour that also challenges much of our received wisdom about that behaviour and its motivations. Unlike them, though, it lacks a single iconoclastic, zeitgeist-defining idea, instead roaming far and wide to illustrate the problems, individual and collective, personal and ideological, that dog our interactions with others in our globalised, but increasingly atomised, culture. \u201cAny element which disrupts the equilibrium between two strangers, whether it is alcohol or power or place, becomes problematic,\u201d he tells me. \u201cThe book is really about those disruptive influences.\u201d</p> <p>His subjects range from the spectacular failures of the FBI to detect spies within its midst to the gullibility and greed of investors who lost vast fortunes by trusting their money to the fraudster <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/jun/29/bernard-madoff-sentence\" title=\"\">Bernard Madoff</a>. Along the way, he demolishes the Italian authorities\u2019 case against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/sep/07/amanda-knox-acquitted-because-of-stunning-flaws-in-investigation\" title=\"\">Amanda Knox</a>, the American student accused of murdering her roommate, Meredith Kercher, in Perugia in 2007. And, using recent research into the concept that crimes are intrinsically linked to the locations they occur in, he suggests new ways of tackling crime prevention. He even employs the same research to insist that the poet, Sylvia Plath, might not have killed herself had she not been living in a house with a gas cooker. So far, so Gladwellian.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The best kind of self-help is not a prescription for how to improve your life, it\u2019s a prompt</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For his fans, who are legion, this is familiar territory: an iconoclastic take on the big subjects we think we know about and the even bigger subjects whose complexity is such that we need someone to explain them on our behalf.

Put simply, it states that our fundamental reaction to the receipt of any kind of new information is to believe it.

Research and writing seem to consume much of his waking life: he lives alone in a downtown New York apartment. His friend, Bruce Headlam, says: \u201cHe\u2019s dated a lot of women\u2026 But he has work to do.\u201d His success is such that he can command $45,000 for a single corporate public speaking engagement. He drew flak in 2011 when he did three talks for Bank of America, having voiced support for Occupy Wall Street.</p> <p>His popularising approach has not endeared Gladwell to his peers. Steven Pinker, his most obvious precursor in the popular science publishing boom of the 1990s, described him as \u201ca minor genius who unwittingly demonstrates the hazards of statistical reasoning\u201d. In <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/115467/malcolm-gladwell-americas-best-paid-fairy-tale-writer\" title=\"\">an extended takedown</a> in the <em>New Republic</em>, the English thinker John Gray described Gladwell\u2019s approach as \u201ca mix of moralism and scientism\u201d and his books as \u201canalgesics for those who seek temporary relief from abiding anxiety\u201d. I ask Gladwell if there is indeed an element of self-help in his writing. He seems nonplussed by the suggestion. \u201cI don\u2019t take that as a criticism at all,\u201d he says. \u201cThere has always been an element of that insofar as the books are intended to be instructive, to prompt reflection on the part of the reader.\u201d Nor is he too concerned by the lukewarm reaction to his 2013 book, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/oct/06/david-goliath-malcolm-gladwell-review\" title=\"\"><em>David and Goliath</em></a>, an examination of the role of the underdog that many reviewers found simplistic. \u201cI don\u2019t want to always think I can convince,\u201d he says. \u201cVery few people are going to read <em>Talking to Strangers</em>, for instance, and agree with every argument in it. That\u2019s not the point. The point is to help them reflect on, or think about in new ways, the way they behave and their society behaves. That is the best kind of self-help, it\u2019s not a prescription for how to improve your life, it\u2019s a prompt.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My argument is that because race looms so large now, when you raise it, you chase other considerations away</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>What strikes me most about Gladwell, though, is the determinedly apolitical thrust of his thinking. This may be a reaction to his youthful flirtation with conservatism or a more measured version of the same. When I ask him if he goes out of his way not to be perceived as a political writer, he answers curtly: \u201cI\u2019m not a political writer, no.\u201d So, that was a conscious decision from the start? \u201cIn a way, yes. I feel like there are so many people who write about politics much more ably than I do.\u201d</p> <p>Nevertheless, I say, your writings may well prompt people to shift their attitudes and views, even their behaviour. In some cases, that would surely precipitate a shift in their political consciousness. \u201cWould it?\u201d he says, looking slightly alarmed. \u201cIf so, it wouldn\u2019t be an ideological shift. There is nothing in this book, for instance, that is distinctively liberal or conservative, left or rightwing. It exists outside of that, by design. I don\u2019t want this book to perceived as belonging to one political group or another. In fact, a lot of what I do is a function of my apoliticality. Because I am not looking for political answers, I am forced to search elsewhere. Plus, I don\u2019t find people\u2019s political motivations to be that definitive or that interesting.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"744ad68fac776c5200d9ea6d5fd8059fb80cf3f3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/744ad68fac776c5200d9ea6d5fd8059fb80cf3f3/0_265_4982_2990/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sandra Bland\u2019s death became a hot political issue, but Gladwell ignores the racial context of her death.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sandra Bland\u2019s death became a hot political issue, but Gladwell ignores the racial context of her death.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christian K. Lee/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>Talking to Strangers</em> begins and ends with an example of the stranger problem in extremis: the case of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/25/sandra-bland-suspicion-mistrust-official-inconsistencies\" title=\"\">Sandra Bland</a>, a young black woman, who, in July 2015, took her own life in police custody three days after she had been arrested following an argument with a Texan police officer, Brian Encinia, who pulled her car over for a minor traffic violation. What is interesting about Gladwell\u2019s analysis of the case is that he removes the race element from it altogether, focusing instead on the rigidly managerial ideology of contemporary US law enforcement that encouraged Encinia\u2019s officiousness \u2013 he was considered a model police officer. \u201cThe problems with framing it in terms of race is not that it is inaccurate, it absolutely is effective,\u201d Gladwell says, when I bring this up, \u201cbut the minute you raise race, you derail the conversation and it becomes possible to dismiss this whole story as a story about a racist cop. Now he may be a racist cop, but that is not the issue, the issue is that the system with the best intentions set him up in a certain way.\u201d</p> <p>One cannot help but wonder, though, if Encinia would have reacted in a similar way to a nervous white woman? \u201cThat\u2019s an interesting question. The thing is, though, he stops everyone. He stopped eight people that same day in a largely white area of Texas. Now, was his attitude towards Sandra Bland slightly more punitive because she was female, younger, from out of state and black? I think that is probably correct. I have no way of knowing, but my guess is he might have been slower to lose his temper with someone he deemed familiar.\u201d</p> <p>Is there a danger that, by excluding race altogether, you ignore both the political and social context in which this encounter took place? \u201cMy argument is that because race looms so large now, when you raise it, you chase other considerations away. What I am saying here is, let\u2019s just start the conversation by considering the straightforward policies that led to this disaster. And the fundamental human processes that led to this disaster. And if we want to talk about racism later, by all means.\u201d</p> <p>It is this kind of selectivity that in part makes Gladwell\u2019s approach so novel and provocative, but also, his critics insist, makes his conclusions so questionable. His writing often seems to touch upon, but not fully interrogate, the urgent discontents of our turbulent times. It also raises the question: is his determination to be apolitical in itself a political stance? That would make a good subject for Gladwellian scrutiny.</p> <p><em>Talking to Strangers is published by Penguin.

When I ask him if he goes out of his way not to be perceived as a political writer, he answers curtly: \u201cI\u2019m not a political writer, no.\u201d So, that was a conscious decision from the start? \u201cIn a way, yes. I feel like there are so many people who write about politics much more ably than I do.\u201d Nevertheless, I say, your writings may well prompt people to shift their attitudes and views, even their behaviour. In some cases, that would surely precipitate a shift in their political consciousness. \u201cWould it?\u201d he says, looking slightly alarmed. \u201cIf so, it wouldn\u2019t be an ideological shift. There is nothing in this book, for instance, that is distinctively liberal or conservative, left or rightwing. It exists outside of that, by design. I don\u2019t want this book to perceived as belonging to one political group or another. In fact, a lot of what I do is a function of my apoliticality. Because I am not looking for political answers, I am forced to search elsewhere. Plus, I don\u2019t find people\u2019s political motivations to be that definitive or that interesting.\u201d Talking to Strangers begins and ends with an example of the stranger problem in extremis: the case of Sandra Bland, a young black woman, who, in July 2015, took her own life in police custody three days after she had been arrested following an argument with a Texan police officer, Brian Encinia, who pulled her car over for a minor traffic violation. What is interesting about Gladwell\u2019s analysis of the case is that he removes the race element from it altogether, focusing instead on the rigidly managerial ideology of contemporary US law enforcement that encouraged Encinia\u2019s officiousness \u2013 he was considered a model police officer. \u201cThe problems with framing it in terms of race is not that it is inaccurate, it absolutely is effective,\u201d Gladwell says, when I bring this up, \u201cbut the minute you raise race, you derail the conversation and it becomes possible to dismiss this whole story as a story about a racist cop. Now he may be a racist cop, but that is not the issue, the issue is that the system with the best intentions set him up in a certain way.\u201d One cannot help but wonder, though, if Encinia would have reacted in a similar way to a nervous white woman? \u201cThat\u2019s an interesting question. The thing is, though, he stops everyone. He stopped eight people that same day in a largely white area of Texas. Now, was his attitude towards Sandra Bland slightly more punitive because she was female, younger, from out of state and black? I think that is probably correct. I have no way of knowing, but my guess is he might have been slower to lose his temper with someone he deemed familiar.\u201d Is there a danger that, by excluding race altogether, you ignore both the political and social context in which this encounter took place? \u201cMy argument is that because race looms so large now, when you raise it, you chase other considerations away. What I am saying here is, let\u2019s just start the conversation by considering the straightforward policies that led to this disaster. And the fundamental human processes that led to this disaster. And if we want to talk about racism later, by all means.\u201d It is this kind of selectivity that in part makes Gladwell\u2019s approach so novel and provocative, but also, his critics insist, makes his conclusions so questionable. His writing often seems to touch upon, but not fully interrogate, the urgent discontents of our turbulent times. It also raises the question: is his determination to be apolitical in itself a political stance? That would make a good subject for Gladwellian scrutiny. Talking to Strangers is published by Penguin.

      "bodyText": "Marks &amp; Spencer will almost certainly drop out of the FTSE 100 this week, ending the retailer\u2019s non-stop presence since the index of leading shares was launched 35 years ago. In a sign of the times, the 135-year-old mainstay of the British high street is likely to be replaced by Polymetal International, a Russia-based miner. M&amp;S is in the middle of yet another overhaul to address long-running underperformance issues, particularly in clothing. Investors aren\u2019t convinced \u2013 its shares are down almost 20% this year. The company\u2019s problems stem in part from a failure to respond to changes in consumer behaviour such as online shopping, demand for lower prices and faster fashion trends. For businesses to succeed they need to cater for customers who are more fickle, knowledgeable and cost-conscious. But M&amp;S chairman Archie Norman seems unruffled by the prospect of leaving the FTSE 100. He said: \u201cWhen I went to ITV we dropped out of the FTSE 100, the sky didn\u2019t fall in.\u201d Elsewhere, after the summer lull company reporting starts to rev up again this week with Dixons Carphone, Dunelm and Halfords among a range of retailers publishing results and updates. These companies have their own issues but should provide some insight into how consumers are behaving. This is particularly important because household spending has just about kept the economy afloat while manufacturing, construction and other sectors have slowed or contracted. After output shrank in the second quarter of this year policymakers are hoping we will keep spending. Things are looking shakier as Brexit tests the nerves of even the most hardened shoppers. In August retail sales fell at their fastest pace since 2008, according to the CBI. On Friday GfK\u2019s survey of consumer sentiment showed household confidence ebbing \u2013 including on the important measure of personal finances. At Dixons Carphone, which publishes an update on Thursday, sales of electrical items have held up while trade in mobile phones has slumped. After GfK\u2019s major purchase index dipped, have customers continued to splash out on big TVs, game consoles and white goods? In the less flashy world of home furnishings, shares of Dunelm, which reports annual results on Wednesday, have risen by more than 60% this year after a rocky 2018. Dunelm\u2019s revival is driven partly by getting online and digital sales right \u2013 something M&amp;S is trying to sort out by forming a partnership with Ocado. By contrast, Halfords, which reports on trading on Wednesday, is in the doldrums after three profit warnings since the middle of last year. The bikes and car accessories business has blamed the weather and consumer caution for its woes. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said: \u201cOverall I would expect people to be relatively cagey given that the Brexit deadline of 31 October is approaching. I think we\u2019ll see a wide range of people adapting well and less well. It\u2019s not uniformly bad and we can see winners and losers appearing.\u201d Away from retail, Greene King\u2019s board could face difficult questions at its annual meeting on Friday after agreeing to sell to Hong Kong\u2019s richest family for \u00a32.7bn. Many shareholders will like the 51% premium they are receiving, but some may be unhappy about the prospect of pubs being closed and redeveloped. Also in the leisure sector, the Restaurant Group will unveil Andy Hornby as chief executive with first-half results on Tuesday. Hornby, who started a month ago, was a surprise choice as boss because he ran HBOS when the bank faced collapse in 2008.

Dark side to man who made VW a roaring success Not everyone would welcome a leader who takes high-stakes gambles, disdains governance rules, manipulates and occasionally humiliates those around him and remains vague about the number of his offspring. But Ferdinand Piech, the engineer who turned Volkswagen into a dominant force in global car manufacturing, lauded after his death last week, shared those traits. Born with a place in the ruling class, and hardened by boarding school, Piech \u2013 the grandson of Ferdinand Porsche, and son of Anton Piech, who ran the VW works under the Nazi regime \u2013 combined ability and passion for car design with vision: bringing VW and Porsche back together and adding a stable of other brands, built with common components to bring economies of scale to their manufacturing processes. Beyond his automotive prowess, he was also known for machiavellian tactics of management with his own executives, which included dividing up projects to ensure he was the one able to piece together the company secrets. Critics said that his ruthless leadership style shaped the culture of a company where outbreaks of controversy erupted over the decades: ranging from alleged industrial espionage to a bribery and prostitution scandal, all eventually topped off by VW deceiving inspectors into allowing 11 million dirty diesel vehicles on to the roads. Piech left in 2015 just as it was discovered that VW had been fitting its cars with defeat devices designed to cheat emission tests, leaving the company synonymous with scandal. In business, as in politics, the tension between projecting corporate responsibility and the desire for cutthroat success is ever present. The Piech style might seem an anachronism from the macho world of car manufacturing; yet many a board or shareholder might still hanker after such a win-at-all-costs leader. His legacy of a vast VW corporation is not in doubt. But the world has been choking on its fumes.",

The demonstrations have plunged Hong Kong into its most serious political crisis in decades. The Hong Kong government, backed by Beijing, has ramped up their tactics on protesters who have also escalated their methods, throwing petrol bombs and bricks on Saturday.</p> \n<p>As helicopters hovered overhead, protesters clashed with police in various locations throughout the city as they took to the streets in defiance of a police ban and marked the anniversary of a decision by Beijing to limit democratic reforms in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory.</p> \n<p>Earlier in the day, thousands of protesters had surrounded government headquarters, shining lasers at the building, taunting police, and throwing objects into the complex.</p> \n<p>Police fired multiple rounds of tear gas from inside the compound, shrouding a six-lane traffic artery in gas while protesters threw the canisters back. The police also deployed water cannons, spraying protesters with blue dye, a method of marking them for later arrests.</p> \n<p>After retreating from the government complex, hundreds of protesters surrounded the police headquarters where they built a barricade of plastic barriers, traffic cones, and other debris across a road and set it alight, sending plumes of black smoke into the sky until firefighters put the blaze out.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"005a347a1626237665ae8b63529f606df730c27f\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/005a347a1626237665ae8b63529f606df730c27f/1030_796_4929_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Demonstrators set barricades on fire near Wan Chai police station.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Demonstrators set barricades on fire near Wan Chai police station.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Clashes continued throughout the night as police in various locations chased protesters, pinning them to the ground to arrest them. Undercover police dressed as protesters were seen firing rounds of pepper spray on demonstrators, who attacked them with umbrellas. Police reportedly fired at least one live round in a warning shot outside Victoria Park.</p> \n<p>A march earlier in the day was peaceful, attended by families, middle-aged and elderly residents. The march had originally been called off by the organiser, Civil Human Rights Front, after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/30/hong-kong-pro-democracy-leader-joshua-wong-arrested-says-demosisto\">police arrested prominent pro-democracy lawmakers and activists</a>, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2019/aug/30/we-shall-not-surrender-hong-kong-activist-joshua-wong-says-after-release-on-bail-video\">Joshua Wong</a>, a student leader in the 2014 pro-democracy protests known as the umbrella movement.</p> \n<p>Demonstrators marched despite heavy rain, following parts of the original route.

The proposal kicked off the umbrella movement, which paralysed parts of the city for 79 days.</p> \n<p>As police and protesters clashed in the early evening, the government said \u201crashly\u201d implementing universal suffrage, one of the demands of the demonstrators this summer as well as in 2014, was \u201cirresponsible\u201d and would only \u201cfurther polarise society\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cAny discussions on constitutional development have to be premised on the legal basis, and be conducted under a peaceful atmosphere with mutual trust,\u201d it said in a statement.</p> \n<p>This summer\u2019s demonstrations have now lasted longer than the umbrella movement, surprising both protesters and residents with its momentum. Protesters said the turnout on Saturday showed the movement was still going strong.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou can see a lot of Hong Kong people still coming out today.

Saturday\u2019s clashes come after almost three months of mass protests, triggered by a bill that would allow extradition to mainland China. The demonstrations have plunged Hong Kong into its most serious political crisis in decades. The Hong Kong government, backed by Beijing, has ramped up their tactics on protesters who have also escalated their methods, throwing petrol bombs and bricks on Saturday. As helicopters hovered overhead, protesters clashed with police in various locations throughout the city as they took to the streets in defiance of a police ban and marked the anniversary of a decision by Beijing to limit democratic reforms in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory. Earlier in the day, thousands of protesters had surrounded government headquarters, shining lasers at the building, taunting police, and throwing objects into the complex. Police fired multiple rounds of tear gas from inside the compound, shrouding a six-lane traffic artery in gas while protesters threw the canisters back. The police also deployed water cannons, spraying protesters with blue dye, a method of marking them for later arrests. After retreating from the government complex, hundreds of protesters surrounded the police headquarters where they built a barricade of plastic barriers, traffic cones, and other debris across a road and set it alight, sending plumes of black smoke into the sky until firefighters put the blaze out. Clashes continued throughout the night as police in various locations chased protesters, pinning them to the ground to arrest them. Undercover police dressed as protesters were seen firing rounds of pepper spray on demonstrators, who attacked them with umbrellas. Police reportedly fired at least one live round in a warning shot outside Victoria Park. A march earlier in the day was peaceful, attended by families, middle-aged and elderly residents. The march had originally been called off by the organiser, Civil Human Rights Front, after police arrested prominent pro-democracy lawmakers and activists, including Joshua Wong, a student leader in the 2014 pro-democracy protests known as the umbrella movement. Demonstrators marched despite heavy rain, following parts of the original route. Jackie, a protester who had brought her mother to the march, said: \u201cOur government hasn\u2019t replied to any of our demands ... we are in a corner and we can\u2019t do anything apart from coming out to the street every single weekend.\u201d Critics have begun comparing footage of the police storming the train station to an episode in July, when dozens of masked men in Yuen Long, an outskirt of Hong Kong, beat commuters with rods \u2013 an incident that spurred more protests. Despite the arrests and harsher police tactics, protesters said they would continue to make their demands, which include the permanent withdrawal of the extradition bill. \u201cIf we stop now, only punishment awaits us,\u201d said Sonny Lai, 21, a protester who was wearing plastic body armour, a gas mask and gloves and was holding boxing pads. Hong Kong\u2019s leader, Carrie Lam, has hinted that a draconian emergency law could be enacted, giving the government sweeping powers to crack down on demonstrators. \u201cThey are trying to crack down on the movement as soon as possible, and they just don\u2019t want to give any concessions to Hong Kong people,\u201d said Lo Kin-hei, the vice-chair of the Democratic party. Observers believe Beijing is anxious to stop the protests before 1 October, which marks 70 years since the founding of the People\u2019s Republic, a politically important anniversary. \u201cIf we don\u2019t stand up now, it\u2019s going to be too late,\u201d said Simon Chang, a protester in Wan Chai, where earlier in the day hundreds had filled a sports stadium, holding posters featuring Lam with a bloodied eye \u2013 a reference to a protester who was seriously injured in one eye. Another protester, who asked not to give her name, said: \u201cEven if they arrest more people, that won\u2019t stop us. They keep arresting people, making us more angry. We will keep coming out.\u201d According to recent reports, Beijing has ordered Lam not to concede to any of the protesters\u2019 demands, including more politically feasible ones such as the permanent withdrawal of the extradition bill, which officials have already announced dead, or an independent inquiry into police behaviour toward protesters. Chan said he believed Beijing was holding Lam back because meeting any demands would \u201ccreate a feeling that we are able to do something against the government\u201d. He added: \u201cAnd they don\u2019t want this sentiment to spread.\u201d Saturday marks five years since China handed down a proposal to introduce democratic elections in Hong Kong, as laid out in the basic law, the territory\u2019s mini constitution, and promised by previous leaders. China\u2019s proposal allowed for popular election of Hong Kong\u2019s leader, the chief executive, but only among candidates chosen by an election committee dominated by pro-Beijing members. The proposal kicked off the umbrella movement, which paralysed parts of the city for 79 days. As police and protesters clashed in the early evening, the government said \u201crashly\u201d implementing universal suffrage, one of the demands of the demonstrators this summer as well as in 2014, was \u201cirresponsible\u201d and would only \u201cfurther polarise society\u201d. \u201cAny discussions on constitutional development have to be premised on the legal basis, and be conducted under a peaceful atmosphere with mutual trust,\u201d it said in a statement. This summer\u2019s demonstrations have now lasted longer than the umbrella movement, surprising both protesters and residents with its momentum. Protesters said the turnout on Saturday showed the movement was still going strong. \u201cYou can see a lot of Hong Kong people still coming out today. They are not afraid,\u201d said Elsa Chu, 38, who was protesting outside of the government headquarters. \u201cHong Kong people know that if we are afraid, we will have nothing. We will stay together to protest and protect our home,\u201d she said.",

Both the use and abuse of prescription opioids \u2013 painkillers such as OxyContin and Vicodin \u2013 have, since the 1990s, rocketed. Last year, 211m opioid prescriptions were handed out in the US. At its peak in 2012, that figure stood at 255m \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/maps/rxrate-maps.html\" title=\"\">82 prescriptions for every 100 residents</a>. In 2016, a fifth of all deaths among Americans aged 24 to 35 were <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2682878\" title=\"\">due to opioids</a>. <a href=\"http://thenationshealth.aphapublications.org/content/49/1/1.2\" title=\"\">Opioid-caused deaths have been a major factor in life expectancy falling for three</a> years in a row.</p> <p>Foreign drug cartels have certainly exploited the epidemic, smuggling in heroin and Chinese-made opioids such as fentanyl. But they are relatively minor players in comparison with the US drug companies that, between 2006 and 2012, saturated America with 76bn oxycodone and hydrocodone pills alone. It resulted in <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/76-billion-opioid-pills- newly-released-federal-data-unmasks-the-epidemic/2019/07/16/5f29fd62- a73e-11e9-86dd-d7f0e60391e9_story.html\" title=\"\">nearly 100,000 deaths</a>. In 2016, one million Americans were using heroin.

Insofar as drug cartels are playing a role in the opioid crisis, it is because pharmaceutical companies created a market for them.</p> <p>The relationship between big pharma and US doctors can only be described as corrupt. <a href=\"https://openpaymentsdata.cms.gov/summary\" title=\"\">Official figures</a> show that last year 627,000 doctors received between them more than $2.1bn in what are called \u201cgeneral payments\u201d \u2013 payments unrelated to research. The total paid to doctors and hospitals by drug companies was more than $9bn. Unsurprisingly, the greater the payments, the more willing doctors were to prescribe opioids.</p> <p>Big pharma\u2019s relationship with lawmakers is equally rotten. Between 2006 and 2015, drug companies and their advocate organisations spent <a href=\"https://publicintegrity.org/state-politics/pharma-lobbying-held-deep-influence-over-opioid-policies/\" title=\"\">more than $880m</a> on lobbying. They contributed to the campaigns of <a href=\"https://publicintegrity.org/state-politics/politics-of-pain-drugmakers-fought-state-opioid-limits-amid-crisis/\" title=\"\">more than 7,000 candidates for state-level offices</a>.

It is an indictment of a health system built on profit, a political perspective that encourages the medicalisation of social problems and a racialised \u201cwar on drugs\u201d.</p> <p>The roots of the crisis lie in the 1980s and Ronald Reagan\u2019s policy of corporate deregulation. Drug companies, led by Purdue Pharma, the corporation owned by the Mortimer and Raymond branches of the Sackler family, took advantage with aggressive marketing campaigns to convince doctors and regulators of the need for, and the safety of, a new class of opioid analgesics. Drugs previously used primarily for patients with cancer or a terminal illness became a routine prescription.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t just marketing skills that drove this shift. This was an era of deindustrialisation, mass job losses and the breakdown of communities, particularly in white rural areas such as West Virginia, and in the rust belt of the midwest, many of the areas that later became \u201cTrump country\u201d. These communities were targeted by drug companies. The answer to poverty, social dislocation and political disillusionment became opioid pills. Between 1991 and 2011, <a href=\"https://addiction.surgeongeneral.gov/\" title=\"\">painkiller prescriptions</a> in the US tripled.</p> <p>The problem was exacerbated by America\u2019s insurance-based healthcare system. Insurance companies insist on the cheapest solution to any problem. And pills are cheap.

      "bodyText": "\u2018We\u2019ll build a wall to keep the damn drugs out.\u201d So insisted Donald Trump at a rally last year to launch the White House\u2019s initiative to stop opioid abuse. For Trump, at the heart of America\u2019s opioid crisis lie open borders, illegal immigrants and foreign drug cartels. Brad Beckworth, an Oklahoma state attorney, takes a different view. The drugs to which so many in the state are addicted, he told a court in July, \u201cdidn\u2019t get here from drug cartels. They got here from one cartel: the pharmaceutical industry cartel.\u201d The court agreed. Last week, it ordered the pharmaceutical giant Johnson &amp; Johnson to pay $572m in compensation for running a \u201cfalse and dangerous\u201d sales campaign that had created an unprecedented epidemic of addiction in Oklahoma. America\u2019s opioid crisis is stark. Both the use and abuse of prescription opioids \u2013 painkillers such as OxyContin and Vicodin \u2013 have, since the 1990s, rocketed. Last year, 211m opioid prescriptions were handed out in the US. At its peak in 2012, that figure stood at 255m \u2013 82 prescriptions for every 100 residents. In 2016, a fifth of all deaths among Americans aged 24 to 35 were due to opioids. Opioid-caused deaths have been a major factor in life expectancy falling for three years in a row. Foreign drug cartels have certainly exploited the epidemic, smuggling in heroin and Chinese-made opioids such as fentanyl. But they are relatively minor players in comparison with the US drug companies that, between 2006 and 2012, saturated America with 76bn oxycodone and hydrocodone pills alone. It resulted in nearly 100,000 deaths. In 2016, one million Americans were using heroin. Eleven times as many misused prescription opioids, more than 2 million of whom had become addicted; 80% of new heroin users started out misusing prescription painkillers. Insofar as drug cartels are playing a role in the opioid crisis, it is because pharmaceutical companies created a market for them. The relationship between big pharma and US doctors can only be described as corrupt. Official figures show that last year 627,000 doctors received between them more than $2.1bn in what are called \u201cgeneral payments\u201d \u2013 payments unrelated to research. The total paid to doctors and hospitals by drug companies was more than $9bn. Unsurprisingly, the greater the payments, the more willing doctors were to prescribe opioids. Big pharma\u2019s relationship with lawmakers is equally rotten. Between 2006 and 2015, drug companies and their advocate organisations spent more than $880m on lobbying. They contributed to the campaigns of more than 7,000 candidates for state-level offices. And they secretly funded \u201cindependent\u201d patient groups to advocate on their behalf. There is, however, more to the story of the opioid crisis than venal drug companies. It is an indictment of a health system built on profit, a political perspective that encourages the medicalisation of social problems and a racialised \u201cwar on drugs\u201d. The roots of the crisis lie in the 1980s and Ronald Reagan\u2019s policy of corporate deregulation. Drug companies, led by Purdue Pharma, the corporation owned by the Mortimer and Raymond branches of the Sackler family, took advantage with aggressive marketing campaigns to convince doctors and regulators of the need for, and the safety of, a new class of opioid analgesics. Drugs previously used primarily for patients with cancer or a terminal illness became a routine prescription. It wasn\u2019t just marketing skills that drove this shift. This was an era of deindustrialisation, mass job losses and the breakdown of communities, particularly in white rural areas such as West Virginia, and in the rust belt of the midwest, many of the areas that later became \u201cTrump country\u201d. These communities were targeted by drug companies. The answer to poverty, social dislocation and political disillusionment became opioid pills. Between 1991 and 2011, painkiller prescriptions in the US tripled. The problem was exacerbated by America\u2019s insurance-based healthcare system. Insurance companies insist on the cheapest solution to any problem. And pills are cheap. In Japan, doctors treat acute pain with opioids in 47% of cases; in America, the figure is 97%. Then there is the question of race. It\u2019s no coincidence that the opioid epidemic has devastated largely white, working-class and rural communities. It was a conscious strategy by pharmaceutical companies to avoid the taint of being associated with inner cities, black communities and illicit drug use. Deregulation took place at the same time as the launch of the \u201cwar on drugs\u201d, a war waged against foreign drug dealers and within African American urban communities. The consequence was more intensive and repressive policing, greater social inequality, mass incarceration of black men \u2013 and a social narrative about \u201cdrug-infested ghettos\u201d. David Herzberg, author of Happy Pills in America, a cultural history of America\u2019s relationship to drugs, observes that for more than a century there have been parallel discussions about drug use. Psychoactive drugs used largely by middle-class whites are classified as \u201ctherapeutic\u201d and \u201cmedicines\u201d and subject to light-touch regulation. Those used by non-whites and the poor are deemed \u201cillegal\u201d and sanctions are enforced through harsh policing. Trump\u2019s rhetoric about foreign drug cartels and illegal immigrants is merely the latest expression of the historic tendency to view the problem of drugs through a racial lens. And while blacks have been the main victims of this, the opioid crisis shows how a racist perspective can affect poor whites, too. It is tempting to see the opioid crisis as a peculiarly American issue. There are features of the story that are unique to America. But many aspects, from the tendency to treat social issues as medical problems to the racialisation of the \u201cwar on drugs\u201d, have wider relevance too, not least to Britain. Perhaps the most important lesson to learn is that turning health into a money-making machine inevitably has tragic consequences. Supporters of the free market, and of its extension into areas such as health, suggest that privatised services are more efficient. The reality is that when the primary goal is profit, not social need, corruption gets built into the system. The actions of companies such as Purdue and Johnson &amp; Johnson are contemptible. They also follow the logic of the market. \u2022 Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist",

You cannot find it in a bookshop or read it online. It has no manual or handbook. Instead, it is a delicate assemblage of laws, practices and institutions, built over centuries and held together by a fragile tissue of customs, conventions and understandings. It relies on trust and on a common commitment to its unwritten rules. That has allowed it to adapt and evolve, but leaves it dangerously vulnerable to the abuse of power.</p> <p>Boris Johnson\u2019s predecessors were often careless with the constitution, but none showed such contempt for its core principles. The United Kingdom is a parliamentary democracy, in which \u201cthe will of the people\u201d flows through our elected representatives. Our claim to be democratically governed rests on this slender foundation: that a government must command the confidence of the elected chamber. By wielding the royal prerogative to silence parliament, Johnson has struck at the foundations of our democracy.</p> <p>Johnson is perhaps the first prime minister in British history who does not recognise parliament, or a parliamentary election, as the source of his authority. He was placed in No 10 by 90,000 party activists \u2013 not much larger than a single constituency \u2013 whom he courted through his column in the <em>Daily Telegraph</em>. He appointed Dominic Cummings to the heart of government: a man who months earlier had been found to be in contempt of parliament. Once, that would have disbarred him from office. Today, it is a programme for government.</p> <p>He will claim a higher mandate than parliament: \u201cthe will of the people\u201d, expressed in the referendum. Yet it gave no instruction on the terms of Brexit, a fact Johnson exploited to vote down a previous withdrawal agreement. Once we decide that someone other than parliament should interpret the referendum \u2013 that some heroic leader knows more truly what was in the mind of voters \u2013 we are walking a very dangerous road.</p> <p>In the short term, prorogation may succeed. If Johnson goes for no deal, it makes it harder for MPs to stop him. If he wrings some kind of package from the EU, it may frighten some into backing it. If all else fails, it clears the way for a \u201cpeople versus parliament\u201d election.</p> <p>But at what cost? Like loggers torching the Brazilian rainforest, Johnson and adviser Dominic Cummings have traded short-term profit for devastating structural harm. They have set precedents that others will follow and scorched the fragile ecosystem of our democracy. \u201cConservatives\u201d once saw it as their responsibility to protect the constitution. How times change.</p> <h2>Peter Bone</h2> <p><em>Conservative MP and adviser to Leave Means Leave </em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"fc125c048a59836dd81c3e8fc9613e0e23ca890d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc125c048a59836dd81c3e8fc9613e0e23ca890d/424_255_1143_1428/800.jpg\" alt=\"Peter Bone.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Peter Bone.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Thomas/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yes, there is a coup being attempted, but it\u2019s not by the government. It is by a group of hardline Remainers who refuse to accept the will of the British people.</p> <p>These non-democrats are trying to seize power from the legitimate government of Boris Johnson, and install a so-called government of national unity headed by Jeremy Corbyn, and stuffed full of uber-Remainers, with not a single Leaver in sight!</p> <p>The prorogation of parliament by Boris Johnson is a long-overdue restoration of parliamentary democracy. In fact, the shadow leader of the house and other opposition MPs have been demanding this for months. The current session of parliament covers three calendar years and is by far the longest since the civil war. Each session of parliament normally lasts a year. It starts with the Queen\u2019s speech, where the government outlines the bills it wants to get through in the next 12 months, and if it doesn\u2019t get them through in that time, it risks losing them.</p> <p>The opposition then have a number of days to debate and scrutinise , in detail, the government\u2019s programme. At the end of the debate it can try to amend the Queen\u2019s speech or defeat it. If the Queen\u2019s speech is defeated, it inevitably leads to a general election. It also resets the parliamentary calendar, which, under parliament\u2019s standing orders, allows opposition parties 20 days where they choose the motions to be debated, 35 days when the backbench business committee chooses the subjects to be debated, and 13 days when MPs can introduce legislation.</p> <p>Proroguing parliament clearly restores parliamentary democracy and is constitutionally standard. This is not an attempt to stop parliament blocking a no-deal Brexit. Had the prime minister prorogued parliament until 1 November, that would have been a constitutional outrage, and I would have been the first to call it out.</p> <p>If Jeremy Corbyn wants to stop a no-deal Brexit, he has to follow a simple course of action. On Tuesday, he calls a vote of no confidence in the government, and on Wednesday he tries to win that vote. He won\u2019t do that because he knows that he doesn\u2019t have the votes in the House of Commons and, more importantly, he doesn\u2019t have the votes in the country to win a general election. </p> <p>My message to Jeremy Corbyn is simple \u2013 put up, or shut up!</p> <h2><strong>Margaret Beckett</strong></h2> <p><em>Labour MP for Derby South</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"d3b3c8bf70eb1ebc4c37fcb43c00a3550ec205e2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d3b3c8bf70eb1ebc4c37fcb43c00a3550ec205e2/3156_525_711_889/400.jpg\" alt=\"Margaret Beckett.\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Margaret Beckett.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Saker/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yes.

But is this outrage justified?</p> <p>Make no mistake, to prorogue like this is far from normal. Yes, a short prorogation (usually a few days) happens routinely between one annual parliamentary session and the next. But this five-week prorogation is the longest since 1930. It has also been triggered in the midst of a political crisis, with the clock ticking down to 31 October. It immediately follows a five-week summer break, during which MPs could not scrutinise the government\u2019s Brexit policy. Indeed, Johnson has faced just one day of parliamentary scrutiny since becoming PM. Should the prorogation go ahead, that would become one week\u2019s scrutiny over almost three months. By 14 October, when MPs are set to return, fewer than three weeks would remain until the Brexit deadline.</p> <p>No 10 insists that parliament was already due to break up for weeks for the party conferences. But this is disingenuous, for two reasons. First, it had not yet been decided. And second, MPs were the ones who got to choose \u2013 and looked increasingly likely to reject this. Prorogation denies them the choice. He has also largely scuppered the chances of a no-confidence vote. We knew the opposition parties were discussing this, but had not yet agreed on their alternative prime minister. The Fixed-term Parliaments Act provides 14 days to appoint an alternative government. But the prorogation cuts across this \u2013 and would leave as little as 24 hours to get organised after such a vote.</p> <p>So Johnson\u2019s actions are unprecedented, and appear designed to undermine MPs\u2019 desire to scrutinise his government, or even to remove it from office. In a parliamentary democracy, where the government is accountable to parliament, and exists only because it enjoys parliament\u2019s confidence, this is deeply problematic. Hence the various court cases challenging prorogation.</p> <p>Does this amount to a constitutional coup? In short, it\u2019s hard to define what\u2019s \u201cunconstitutional\u201d in a system with an unwritten constitution.</p> <p>Proponents would argue that Johnson has not broken the letter of the law. But our constitution relies on conventions and precedents, not just law, and those very clearly have been broken. A \u201cpolitical\u201d constitution such as ours is a fragile thing, which depends on key players respecting norms and traditions. If they fail to do so they undermine it gravely.</p> <p>The dangerous precedents that would be set by prorogation apply around the world. Governments must not be able to shut down democratic legislatures just in order to dodge inconvenient scrutiny. This is an executive power grab, and when MPs return on Tuesday they should reject it loud and clear.</p>",

And second, MPs were the ones who got to choose \u2013 and looked increasingly likely to reject this. Prorogation denies them the choice. He has also largely scuppered the chances of a no-confidence vote. We knew the opposition parties were discussing this, but had not yet agreed on their alternative prime minister. The Fixed-term Parliaments Act provides 14 days to appoint an alternative government. But the prorogation cuts across this \u2013 and would leave as little as 24 hours to get organised after such a vote. So Johnson\u2019s actions are unprecedented, and appear designed to undermine MPs\u2019 desire to scrutinise his government, or even to remove it from office. In a parliamentary democracy, where the government is accountable to parliament, and exists only because it enjoys parliament\u2019s confidence, this is deeply problematic. Hence the various court cases challenging prorogation. Does this amount to a constitutional coup? In short, it\u2019s hard to define what\u2019s \u201cunconstitutional\u201d in a system with an unwritten constitution. Proponents would argue that Johnson has not broken the letter of the law. But our constitution relies on conventions and precedents, not just law, and those very clearly have been broken. A \u201cpolitical\u201d constitution such as ours is a fragile thing, which depends on key players respecting norms and traditions. If they fail to do so they undermine it gravely. The dangerous precedents that would be set by prorogation apply around the world. Governments must not be able to shut down democratic legislatures just in order to dodge inconvenient scrutiny. This is an executive power grab, and when MPs return on Tuesday they should reject it loud and clear.",

It\u2019s OK to like what you like, but experimentation can lead to new favourites. A delivery man told me he only ate Whole Nut, but I got him to try Vanini\u2019s excellent 34% cocoa single origin Ugandan milk with whole almonds (\u00a33.49, 100g). He loved it and I would urge you to try it if milky nutty chocolate is your thing (it\u2019s also organic and has good credentials). I would have also got him to push his taste buds further still with the 56% whole hazelnuts and caramel version \u2013 but I had eaten it all. If I stuck to just what I know I would never have tried Montezuma\u2019s 70% Dark Chocolate with Lemon and Coconut (\u00a32.59, 100g). Neither are flavours I would say I like in a chocolate and yet it works really well. Everyone who I\u2019ve managed to get to try it (I am generous with my chocolate) has gone back for seconds. Two others I\u2019ve experimented with, which have taken me outside my comfort zone but which have beguiled me, are Divine\u2019s 85% with Blueberry and Popped Quinoa (\u00a32.99, 80g) \u2013 perfect when you want a high cocoa hit but with a bit of something else. And the three-ingredient, Mexican-style stone ground Taza with cinnamon (\u00a35.95. 77g) that I ended up eating in a single, piggy, sitting.",

As he saw it, an absence of strategy would engender the sense that the US was \u201cproving unreliable.\u201d \u201cI was disappointed and frustrated,\u201d he writes. \u201cPolicymakers all too often failed to deliver clear direction.\u201d Yet Mattis does not grapple with domestic political realities. Lives and treasure aside, Iraq cost the Republicans both houses of Congress in 2006 and paved the way for Obama. Furthermore, casualty counts in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin were factors in Hillary Clinton\u2019s defeat. Not everything is about Russia. When it comes to Trump, Mattis flanks, avoiding a head-on clash. Call Sign Chaos takes aim at bigotry and lauds the military service of migrants. As in his resignation letter, Mattis gives full-throated support for Nato: \u201cNations with allies thrive, and those without wither.\u201d In his epilogue, Mattis notes America\u2019s political divide and full-throated tribalism. But he is optimistic. Call Sign Chaos ends thus: \u201cE Pluribus Unum.\u201d",

The group of restaurants that has been opened across the northwest of England by chef and restaurateur Gary Usher is meant to be the anti-story. In 2011 when he launched the first, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/feb/14/sticky-walnut-chester-restaurant-review\" title=\"\">Sticky Walnut</a> in Chester, he went all Royston Vasey and warned the likes of me off.

I piled in and, infuriatingly for him, liked it very much. Usher\u2019s restaurants don\u2019t serve ground-breaking food. He\u2019s not attempting to leap boundaries, or draw attention to himself through his deft cooking. He\u2019s just serving up the kind of classy, appealing food you\u2019d like to eat repeatedly, and at a reasonable price. And where the hell is the story in that?</p> <p>Over the past few years, in the face of crass intransigence from the banks, he has used the crowdfunding model to help open a growing group of these neighbourhood bistros that I am not meant to visit.

Usher may talk down his little neighbourhood bistros, but people seem to love them, and want one of their own.</p> <p>Rightly so. With a trip to Manchester planned, I scan the available possibilities. The city has many of those. But I keep clicking my way back to the <a href=\"https://www.kalabistro.co.uk/\" title=\"\">menu</a> at Kala. No, there really is nothing extraordinary about any of these dishes. There is no story. Except for the much bigger one, which is this: the health of a restaurant culture is not defined by a baby-handful of glittering temples to gastronomy flogging platefuls of overwrought ambition and memories. It\u2019s defined by places like Kala quietly feeding you well.</p> <p>So here I now am, up the curving staircase from the handsome dark wood bar at the front, to this first-floor space with its polished concrete floor and its emerald green banquettes in leather and velveteen. It has shell- shaped wall lights, an open kitchen and inked and eager waiters. To get started we have a plate of golden crusted focaccia which, just for good measure, has been dribbled with a little extra olive oil to ease everything on its way.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"907e49798420ea29230aede26e3f1a3068fc4e73\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/907e49798420ea29230aede26e3f1a3068fc4e73/630_651_4334_2601/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Pleasingly pink\u2019: chicken liver p\u00e2t\u00e9.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Pleasingly pink\u2019: chicken liver p\u00e2t\u00e9.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shaw&amp;Shaw/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At lunchtime, as well as the main menu, there is a shorter version at \u00a320 for two courses and \u00a323 for three. We order from both, though there is no sense of being short-changed in the cheap seats. Both feed us just as well. What defines the cooking is the attention to the essentials. A block of a faultless chicken liver parfait from the set menu arrives pleasingly pink. It is glossed with a little oil and dusted with crystals of salt. \u201cWe call that chicken butter,\u201d our waiter says, and I can see why. I slather it on to torn pieces of their brioche, and top it with a smear of their chutney, as if I\u2019m genuinely interested in balancing out the glories of schmaltz.</p> <p>The other starter is a big dollop of snowy burrata, its foetal cheese subtleties pointed up by a dusting of ground walnuts and chilli. Next to it are roasted purple carrots and for crunch, puffed kernels of rice, looking like the insect-eating revolution has begun. Where the parfait feels like an act of classic bourgeois indulgence \u2013 stop rolling your eyes; I hear gout is bang on-trend these days \u2013 this is a dish for those trying to claim an interest in restraint, despite the big hit of dairy fats.</p> <p>A ridged and rugged leg of crisp-skinned duck confit, a contrast to the one that looked so drearily bought in at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/aug/18/the-bh-garden-room-london-sins-against-good-taste-restaurant-review\" title=\"\">that rooftop place</a> a few weeks ago, comes with a mound of a neon orange sweet potato pur\u00e9e. It is soft and velvety. It is a root vegetable transformed into an act of kindness and care. There is a meaty puddle of what I should probably call gravy, this being Manchester, and leaves of baby endive, each one filled with a pokey vinaigrette and sprinkled with chopped chives. It\u2019s a plateful which both makes sense, and is achingly pretty.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ca1c62b41c6122d4761d04fbbb3b9f299081437e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca1c62b41c6122d4761d04fbbb3b9f299081437e/772_643_4004_2403/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018The dessert list laughs in the face of summer\u2019: Yorkshire parkin, butterscotch sauce.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The dessert list laughs in the face of summer\u2019: Yorkshire parkin, butterscotch sauce.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shaw&amp;Shaw/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The nearest to modishness are torched meaty fillets of plaice from the main menu. They come with samphire, brisk cubes of pickled cucumber, deep-fried vinegared anchovies and a chervil sauce, the deep green of a field in winter. Because a positive review is always made by the one, pointed niggle, I shall mention the heavy hand with the salt on the fish, which almost overwhelmed it. I know, Gary, I know; bloody restaurant critics. But take comfort from my deep, intense love for a side dish of charred little gem, sprinkled with deep-fried capers, alongside a big spoonful of a truffled egg yolk emulsion and a serious grating of salty <a href=\"https://www.cheese.com/berkswell/\" title=\"\">Berkswell</a> cheese across the top. Oh, and the sizeable chips which are really just superb roasties, cut to look like something else.</p> <p>The dessert list laughs in the face of summer. You\u2019re in Manchester and here, they take the sweet end seriously. There\u2019s a fair old brick of glossy parkin, with oats for texture and the warmth and encouragement of ginger, all cooled down by a scoop of cr\u00e8me Chantilly and a puddle of butterscotch sauce. There\u2019s a subtantial choux bun, sliced open and filled with passion fruit cream and passion fruit sorbet, then laid in a pond of a caramelised white chocolate sauce. After that a double espresso is medically required.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"393e76bd1e6517605890618683c537d9c5997148\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/393e76bd1e6517605890618683c537d9c5997148/335_274_4688_2813/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Substantial\u2019: choux bun with white chocolate.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Substantial\u2019: choux bun with white chocolate.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shaw&amp;Shaw/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>All this, and as it happens, Usher has form as the kind of employer we need more of. Recently he was on <a href=\"https://threader.app/thread/1130128183091761155\" title=\"\">Twitter</a> asking for advice on how to sort out admin for a homeless man to whom he had offered a kitchen job. He opens the restaurants that people want. He serves the kind of food people like to eat. And he\u2019s good to his staff. If only I could work out what the damn story was.</p> <h2>News bites</h2> <p>Is it too soon to mention The Sp\u00e4rrows again? I do hope not.

      "bodyText": "Kala, 55 King Street, Manchester M2 4LQ (0800 160 1811). Starters \u00a35.50-\u00a314, mains \u00a316-\u00a330, desserts \u00a36-\u00a310, three courses at lunch \u00a323, wines from \u00a322 Journalists like a story, even those of us paddling in the shallow end in search of something nice for our tea: stories like the Holiday Inn just begging to have its terrible food reviewed, or the Swiss-themed place with the stringy fondue and the bought-in sorbet, or the Kurdish family remembering its own culture one dish at a time. The group of restaurants that has been opened across the northwest of England by chef and restaurateur Gary Usher is meant to be the anti-story. In 2011 when he launched the first, Sticky Walnut in Chester, he went all Royston Vasey and warned the likes of me off. This, he said, was a local bistro for local people. Stay away. When he opened his second restaurant, Burnt Truffle in Heswall on the Wirral, I ignored him. I piled in and, infuriatingly for him, liked it very much. Usher\u2019s restaurants don\u2019t serve ground-breaking food. He\u2019s not attempting to leap boundaries, or draw attention to himself through his deft cooking. He\u2019s just serving up the kind of classy, appealing food you\u2019d like to eat repeatedly, and at a reasonable price. And where the hell is the story in that? Over the past few years, in the face of crass intransigence from the banks, he has used the crowdfunding model to help open a growing group of these neighbourhood bistros that I am not meant to visit. There\u2019s Hispi in Didsbury and Wreckfish in Liverpool and Pinion not far away in Prescot (its opening is the subject of a forthcoming Channel 4 documentary). A few months back he opened Kala in Manchester, after breaking the world record for crowdfunding \u00a3100,000 in just 11 hours. Usher may talk down his little neighbourhood bistros, but people seem to love them, and want one of their own. Rightly so. With a trip to Manchester planned, I scan the available possibilities. The city has many of those. But I keep clicking my way back to the menu at Kala. No, there really is nothing extraordinary about any of these dishes. There is no story. Except for the much bigger one, which is this: the health of a restaurant culture is not defined by a baby-handful of glittering temples to gastronomy flogging platefuls of overwrought ambition and memories. It\u2019s defined by places like Kala quietly feeding you well. So here I now am, up the curving staircase from the handsome dark wood bar at the front, to this first-floor space with its polished concrete floor and its emerald green banquettes in leather and velveteen. It has shell- shaped wall lights, an open kitchen and inked and eager waiters. To get started we have a plate of golden crusted focaccia which, just for good measure, has been dribbled with a little extra olive oil to ease everything on its way. At lunchtime, as well as the main menu, there is a shorter version at \u00a320 for two courses and \u00a323 for three. We order from both, though there is no sense of being short-changed in the cheap seats. Both feed us just as well. What defines the cooking is the attention to the essentials. A block of a faultless chicken liver parfait from the set menu arrives pleasingly pink. It is glossed with a little oil and dusted with crystals of salt. \u201cWe call that chicken butter,\u201d our waiter says, and I can see why. I slather it on to torn pieces of their brioche, and top it with a smear of their chutney, as if I\u2019m genuinely interested in balancing out the glories of schmaltz. The other starter is a big dollop of snowy burrata, its foetal cheese subtleties pointed up by a dusting of ground walnuts and chilli. Next to it are roasted purple carrots and for crunch, puffed kernels of rice, looking like the insect-eating revolution has begun. Where the parfait feels like an act of classic bourgeois indulgence \u2013 stop rolling your eyes; I hear gout is bang on-trend these days \u2013 this is a dish for those trying to claim an interest in restraint, despite the big hit of dairy fats. A ridged and rugged leg of crisp-skinned duck confit, a contrast to the one that looked so drearily bought in at that rooftop place a few weeks ago, comes with a mound of a neon orange sweet potato pur\u00e9e. It is soft and velvety. It is a root vegetable transformed into an act of kindness and care. There is a meaty puddle of what I should probably call gravy, this being Manchester, and leaves of baby endive, each one filled with a pokey vinaigrette and sprinkled with chopped chives. It\u2019s a plateful which both makes sense, and is achingly pretty. The nearest to modishness are torched meaty fillets of plaice from the main menu. They come with samphire, brisk cubes of pickled cucumber, deep-fried vinegared anchovies and a chervil sauce, the deep green of a field in winter. Because a positive review is always made by the one, pointed niggle, I shall mention the heavy hand with the salt on the fish, which almost overwhelmed it. I know, Gary, I know; bloody restaurant critics. But take comfort from my deep, intense love for a side dish of charred little gem, sprinkled with deep-fried capers, alongside a big spoonful of a truffled egg yolk emulsion and a serious grating of salty Berkswell cheese across the top. Oh, and the sizeable chips which are really just superb roasties, cut to look like something else. The dessert list laughs in the face of summer. You\u2019re in Manchester and here, they take the sweet end seriously. There\u2019s a fair old brick of glossy parkin, with oats for texture and the warmth and encouragement of ginger, all cooled down by a scoop of cr\u00e8me Chantilly and a puddle of butterscotch sauce. There\u2019s a subtantial choux bun, sliced open and filled with passion fruit cream and passion fruit sorbet, then laid in a pond of a caramelised white chocolate sauce. After that a double espresso is medically required. All this, and as it happens, Usher has form as the kind of employer we need more of. Recently he was on Twitter asking for advice on how to sort out admin for a homeless man to whom he had offered a kitchen job. He opens the restaurants that people want. He serves the kind of food people like to eat. And he\u2019s good to his staff. If only I could work out what the damn story was. News bites Is it too soon to mention The Sp\u00e4rrows again? I do hope not.

Their actions are a valuable reminder that, even among those who are environmentally aware, wealthier people tend to have larger carbon footprints than those less well off and that it is particularly important from an environmental perspective for the rich to limit the number of children they have.

Oxford and Cambridge want to preserve the misconception that their selection procedures embody the creme de la creme of today selecting the creme de la creme of tomorrow. But if you find yourself balking at random selection, ask yourself this: have you ever formed a first impression that was wrong? It might go against the grain, but making more liberal use of lotteries might produce not just a fairer but a better and more diverse world. \u2022 Sonia Sodha is an Observer columnist",

      "body": "<p>The thought of Donald Trump as space commander-in-chief, whizzing around the Milky Way, zapping alien invaders and conquering new worlds, is both comical and terrifying. Before they began exchanging love letters, the US president ridiculed his North Korean counterpart, Kim Jong-un, as \u201clittle rocket man\u201d. With his relaunch last week of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/29/trump-space-command-launch\" title=\"\">US space command</a> (SpaceCom), terrestrial Trump has appropriated the title for himself.</p> <p>While this may be a big step for the man in the White House, it\u2019s a giant leap backwards for mankind. Fresh from his bungled attempt to expand America\u2019s frontiers by buying Greenland, Trump is now suggesting the US has a right to colonise outer space, treating it as a free-fire zone for unlimited superpower competition in \u201cthe next war-fighting domain\u201d. Trump has watched too many repeats of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_(1996_film)\" title=\"\"><em>Independence Day</em></a>. The universe does not belong to America.</p> <p>The 1967 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_Space_Treaty\" title=\"\">Outer Space Treaty</a> clearly states that space is free for exploration and use by all nations and that no nation may claim sovereignty over outer space or any celestial body.

      "bodyText": "The thought of Donald Trump as space commander-in-chief, whizzing around the Milky Way, zapping alien invaders and conquering new worlds, is both comical and terrifying. Before they began exchanging love letters, the US president ridiculed his North Korean counterpart, Kim Jong-un, as \u201clittle rocket man\u201d. With his relaunch last week of US space command (SpaceCom), terrestrial Trump has appropriated the title for himself. While this may be a big step for the man in the White House, it\u2019s a giant leap backwards for mankind. Fresh from his bungled attempt to expand America\u2019s frontiers by buying Greenland, Trump is now suggesting the US has a right to colonise outer space, treating it as a free-fire zone for unlimited superpower competition in \u201cthe next war-fighting domain\u201d. Trump has watched too many repeats of Independence Day. The universe does not belong to America. The 1967 Outer Space Treaty clearly states that space is free for exploration and use by all nations and that no nation may claim sovereignty over outer space or any celestial body. It also prohibits the deployment of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction. Unusually, this is one international treaty the US has actually signed and ratified. It is bound to honour it. While Trump and his Pentagon space cadets may argue they do not intend to assert US sovereign control, their stated intention to establish exclusive, unchallengeable American dominance amounts to much the same thing. Unfortunately, the treaty does not prevent military activities in space, military space forces or weaponisation \u2013 and it is these objectionable aims that lie at the heart of SpaceCom\u2019s new mission. According to Gen John Raymond, SpaceCom commander, being top dog in space is a \u201cvital [US] national interest\u201d that is threatened by rivals, notably China and Russia. \u201cThe scope, scale and complexity of this threat... is real and concerning,\u201d he said. \u201cAlthough space is a war-fighting domain, our goal is to actually deter a conflict extending into space. The best way I know to do that is to be prepared to fight and win... We are the best in the world at space.\u201d How about best in space at space? That would be more impressive. It\u2019s odd the way the American republic finds it necessary to constantly assert its superiority. It smacks of insecurity. And why is the US military mind so deaf and blind to history that it cannot recognise the old, cyclical \u201cthreat=counterthreat=bigger threat\u201d thinking that gave us Vietnam and the insanely dangerous US-Soviet nuclear arms race? Unable or unwilling to learn from the past, the generals have found a new battlefront \u2013 and in Trump someone only too happy to encourage aggressive behaviour. What do they imagine will happen next? Other countries, alarmed by this projection of heavenly hegemony, will seek to match or surpass US capabilities. Like space itself, the potential for ruinously destructive rivalry is infinite. It is entirely reasonable for governments to want to protect satellite communications and navigation systems from, say, ground-based interceptor missiles and electronic warfare.

But over in Holland and Germany, cargo bikes are how many families deal with the transport admin of daily life \u2013 from the school run to shopping trips. (Maybe these cycles should be renamed \u2018precious cargo\u2019 bikes to get more of us on board.) Now Babboe has extended its Slim Mountain range, which is aimed at adventurous parents who want the freedom and fun of travelling longer distances on weekend adventures. The bike has a powerful 250W Yamaha motor coupled to an Enviolo stepless shifting system and force sensor, which allows the motor to adapt the amount of assistance to the rider\u2019s own pedal power. Fully charged it gives you a range of up to 37 miles, depending on load and level of assistance. Front and rear disc brakes are fitted as standard, as are super-bright AXA LED lights. Keeping an eye on the kids couldn\u2019t be easier, as they sit in a straight line in front of the handlebars. This has the added benefit of keeping the bike narrow, making it more manoeuvrable along forest trails. The seats have lap belts, too, so your precious cargo can\u2019t escape.</p> <p>Shortly after this review appeared, I was contacted by Yuge Lei. She\u2019s someone who defines the spirit of adventure envisaged by Babboe. She recently took the cargo bike through five countries over 14 days, covering a total of about 500km. She wrote a daily blog about it for Babboe. Have a look and see if you feel inspired at <a href=\"https://www.babboe.co.uk/boet/category/babboe-slim-on-tour/\">babboe.co.uk/boet/category/babboe-slim-on-tour/</a>.

      "bodyText": "Babboe Slim Mountain cargo ebike Price \u00a33,549, babboe.co.uk Range 24-37mph One of the reasons parents in Britain give for not ferrying their kids about by bike is safety. But over in Holland and Germany, cargo bikes are how many families deal with the transport admin of daily life \u2013 from the school run to shopping trips. (Maybe these cycles should be renamed \u2018precious cargo\u2019 bikes to get more of us on board.) Now Babboe has extended its Slim Mountain range, which is aimed at adventurous parents who want the freedom and fun of travelling longer distances on weekend adventures. The bike has a powerful 250W Yamaha motor coupled to an Enviolo stepless shifting system and force sensor, which allows the motor to adapt the amount of assistance to the rider\u2019s own pedal power. Fully charged it gives you a range of up to 37 miles, depending on load and level of assistance. Front and rear disc brakes are fitted as standard, as are super-bright AXA LED lights. Keeping an eye on the kids couldn\u2019t be easier, as they sit in a straight line in front of the handlebars. This has the added benefit of keeping the bike narrow, making it more manoeuvrable along forest trails. The seats have lap belts, too, so your precious cargo can\u2019t escape. Shortly after this review appeared, I was contacted by Yuge Lei. She\u2019s someone who defines the spirit of adventure envisaged by Babboe. She recently took the cargo bike through five countries over 14 days, covering a total of about 500km. She wrote a daily blog about it for Babboe.

      "bodyText": "Labor frontbencher Tanya Plibersek says she sees a \u201creal problem\u201d with how the government\u2019s proposed religious discrimination law overrides state legislation as she flags the need for further negotiation before the party backs the changes. The senior leftwinger said while the Labor party\u2019s MPs were \u201cabsolutely supporters of religious freedoms\u201d, the inclusion of a specific clause that overrides Tasmania\u2019s Anti-Discrimination Act would be difficult for the opposition to support. \u201cI think that that would be a real problem with this legislation,\u201d Plibersek told ABC\u2019s Insiders program. \u201cI think that it\u2019s something that [attorney general] Christian Porter promised that he wouldn\u2019t do \u2013 interfere with state laws, and I\u2019m sure that the overriding of state laws in this instance is probably driven by Eric Abetz and some of the extreme right because they\u2019ve got problems with the Tasmanian laws. \u201cThat is something that I think we would find very difficult to support, but we have to go through our proper processes on this.\u201d In the legislation released by the Coalition last week, the explanatory note claimed the override of Tasmanian law was necessary \u201cgiven its broad scope and demonstrated ability to affect freedom of religious expression\u201d. Coalition conservatives, including Abetz, have cited the case of Archbishop Julian Porteous \u2013 who had a discrimination complaint against him for anti same-sex marriage leaflets arguing that \u201cmessing with marriage is messing with kids\u201d \u2013 as evidence of the need to override state laws. Plibersek also raised concern about the clauses aimed at addressing the circumstances of Israel Folau, saying there was still some doubt over how the process would work. Under the provisions outlined by Porter, big businesses would have to prove \u201cunjustifiable financial hardship\u201d to put in place a restriction on someone that curbed their freedom of religious expression. \u201cThe provisions that affect the business community, the businesses are already saying: how is this going to work for us? We have to prove economic loss. What\u2019s the process?,\u201d Plibersek said. \u201cI think that there are obviously issues with this.\u201d Plibersek\u2019s criticism comes after the Victorian state Labor government and Tasmanian opposition both criticised the bill as an encroachment on the states. \u201cWe have fought hard to provide a shield that protects against discrimination for not only LGBTIQ people, but women, those with a disability, and minority multicultural and multifaith groups,\u201d Victoria\u2019s minister for equality, Martin Foley, said. \u201cIn Victoria, equality is a non-negotiable, and we will fiercely defend the rights our LGBTIQ Victorians have fought so hard for.\u201d Tasmania\u2019s shadow attorney general, Ella Haddad, called on the Hodgman Liberal government to stand up to the federal Coalition, saying the state law had operated successfully for more than 20 years. \u201cIt protects people\u2019s freedom of religious expression while also ensuring people are protected from hate speech,\u201d Haddad said. \u201cOn first reading, it appears the federal change will increase the likelihood of hate speech. \u201cLabor calls on Will Hodgman to tell his colleagues in Canberra that humiliation and hate speech are not welcome in Tasmania and should not be welcome anywhere in Australia.\u201d Plibersek also commented on revelations this week about a $100,000 donation made to the party\u2019s New South Wales branch from Chinese developer Huang Xiangmo. Plibersek said the case highlighted the need for spending caps on political campaigning and a new federal anti-corruption commission \u201cwith teeth\u201d. \u201cWhile ever there is an arms race on raising funds to do more political advertising, more direct voter contact, you\u2019re going to have this pressure to raise money,\u201d Plibersek said. \u201cAnd while you\u2019ve got people like Clive Palmer able to put in $60m, $70m or $80m or whatever it was in the end, to profoundly influence the outcome of elections, we\u2019ve got a problem with our democracy.\u201d Plibersek said the revelations about the NSW branch were \u201cdisappointing in the extreme\u201d, but the problem was emerging \u201cright across our political culture\u201d. \u201cWe need to, yes, make changes in the Labor party to encourage transparency and accountability, but also to look at our settings for all political parties so that people can have faith in our democracy itself.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Social services minister Anne Ruston has refused to endorse the Newstart payment as adequate amid growing calls for it to be lifted, saying the payment was always intended as a \u201csafety net\u201d. Ruston said the prime minister, Scott Morrison, had already made clear the government was not considering boosting the payment. She repeatedly declined to say the unemployment benefit was enough for daily living costs such as heating and food. \u201cI have not said that it will be easy to live on Newstart,\u201d she said. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be easy. It\u2019s a safety net payment, it never was meant to be a replacement for a wage or a salary. It is there as a safety net to assist people while they haven\u2019t got a job.\u201d Welfare and business groups, backed by Labor and the Greens, have been agitating for an increase to the payment, which provides about $40 a day for those looking for work. Repeatedly asked about the adequacy in the interview on Sky News with David Speers on Sunday, Ruston focused on the government\u2019s pledge to help people into work. \u201cI have answered the question and I absolutely remain totally committed to helping anybody that is on Newstart who wants a job to get a job,\u201d she said. \u201cThe prime minister has made it very clear that currently we are not considering an increase in Newstart. What we are doing is focused on getting people into work.\u201d Ruston was announcing the results of the government\u2019s immunisation program, \u201cno jab, no pay\u201d, which deducts the family tax benefit for families that don\u2019t immunise their children. In 2018-19 the government notified the families of about 350,000 children that they did not meet the immunisation requirements for Family Tax Benefit Part A, resulting in about half getting up to date with their vaccines. Ruston said the policy, first introduced in 2016, was helping to boost immunisation rates. \u201cIt has acted as a powerful driver for families to make sure their children\u2019s vaccinations are fully up to date,\u201d Ruston said.",
