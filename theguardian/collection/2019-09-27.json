      "body": "<p>We all get older, and so do our books. Two years ago, Philip Pullman met the challenge of returning to the world of His Dark Materials by going back in time. <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/nov/19/la-belle-sauvage-book-of-dust-philip-pullman-review\" title=\"\">La Belle Sauvage</a></em>, the first volume of his planned trilogy The Book of Dust, was a prequel, telling how, as a baby, Lyra Belacqua was saved from the deadly agents of the Magisterium, the authoritarian church that is always seeking to extend its powers. Her rescuer was the heroic but thoroughly human Malcolm, an 11-year-old living with his parents in a pub on the river outside Oxford. Now, in <em>The Secret Commonwealth</em>, the second volume of The Book of Dust, Pullman does something riskier: he jumps forward 20 years \u2013 a decade on from the memorably sad, satisfyingly inevitable ending of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/oct/28/booksforchildrenandteenagers.philippullman\" title=\"\">The Amber Spyglass</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/oct/28/booksforchildrenandteenagers.philippullman\" title=\"\"> </a>\u2013 to give us the story of Lyra as a young adult.</p> <p>Now she is a student in that familiar-yet-strange Oxford of Pullman\u2019s alternative world. (This book stays in that world and never crosses to our own.) She has become very intellectual and a little solemn and has fallen out with her daemon, Pantalaimon. But she cannot retreat into her books, as she soon realises that she remains a person of interest to the Magisterium. The book\u2019s gripping opening chapter moves between sinister machinations among leaders of the church in Geneva, and a clumsy murder in night-time Oxford. The murder victim, Lyra discovers, is a botanist \u2013 mystical botanical lore is at the heart of this tale. He had recently returned from a research trip to Central Asia where, we strongly suspect, we will eventually be led.</p> <p>Everyone is older. Malcolm, whose help Lyra soon recruits, has grown into an eccentric young academic with a tendresse for Lyra, his former student, that is distinctly adult. Other characters from the earlier books return, a little time-worn, to assist our heroine. As she flees the deadly theocrats, there are plenty of the thrills you might recognise from His Dark Materials, yet this is a long way from that work. \u201cNot suitable for younger readers,\u201d warns the Waterstones website. There is graphic violence and an attempted gang rape. There is also some depiction of Lyra\u2019s awakened sexuality, though Pullman makes her seek out the company of men to whom she is not attracted, so that she cannot be unfaithful to the absent Will, forever lost to his parallel world.</p> <p>Pullman seems to be writing for those who read the HDM novels as children, but are children no longer. Lyra herself is naggingly conscious of what she has lost from the earlier books. Asked an awkward question by a suspicious stranger, she fails to produce the fearless lies she would once have managed, and thinks to herself that \u201cnow she just lacked inventiveness, or energy, or chutzpah\u201d. Pantalaimon tells her that she has become \u201ccautious \u2026 anxious \u2026 pessimistic\u201d. The two of them become literally as well as psychologically separated; one plotline follows Lyra\u2019s quest to recover her daemon, without whom she appears to others as \u201can appalling and uncanny figure\u201d \u2013 and also, we discover, newly vulnerable.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"79815326d5c3558bc25dc59c0cbbb18f0abb0788\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/79815326d5c3558bc25dc59c0cbbb18f0abb0788/1256_493_2380_2975/800.jpg\" alt=\"Philip Pullman.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Philip Pullman.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She has had her head turned by seductive books. Her daemon goes on a long journey to Wittenberg (the city of Martin Luther, where Hamlet went to university) to accuse the stern intellectual, Gottfried Brande, of stealing Lyra\u2019s imagination from her. Brande has published a huge novel written in a prose purged of all figurative language, which proposes that daemons are illusions: it has become a vogue throughout Europe. Meanwhile Lyra journeys towards the east, while Malcolm separately tracks her. There is always plenty of dizzying travel in Pullman\u2019s fiction, here more breathless than ever. Lyra meets an alchemist in Prague, witnesses an assassination in Constantinople, narrowly avoids being killed in Smyrna.</p> <p>A paranoid gent at a central European railway station or a wizened old lady in a Levantine port only has to mention a distant destination for Lyra or Malcolm to hurtle off towards it. We know that the answers to the book\u2019s various teasing puzzles must lie in that fabled botanical research station (but perhaps beyond the bounds of this particular volume). Pullman\u2019s narrative method is to divide our attentions not only between Lyra, Malcolm and Pan, but also between them and the leading operatives of the Magisterium, scheming and debating about how to perpetuate their chilly faith. We keep going back to the Maison Juste in Geneva, the world centre for \u201cthe examination of heresy and heretics\u201d. Here we get a good deal of ecclesiastical power politics, with the deliciously Machiavellian Marcel Delamere eliminating rivals and concentrating power in his own hands. The satire of religious flummery is even more explicit and withering than in the original trilogy. Indeed, Pullman is more tempted to draw parallels with our world\u2019s discontents than he has ever been. Our own refugee crises and confrontations with Islamic fundamentalism (here \u201cthe brotherhood of the holy purpose\u201d) have their ready analogies in his fictional universe. Lyra is pitted against not only the agents of theocracy but also a ruthless multinational chemical company.</p> <p>His main target here, however, is as much intolerant rationality as intolerant theism \u2013 the life-denying Reason that William Blake, his literary guide, deplored and mocked. The Magisterium has recruited a clever nihilistic philosopher, Simon Talbot. He is their \u201cuseful idiot\u201d. Lyra so relishes intellectual dispute, \u201csearching out the weaknesses in someone else\u2019s arguments, and cracking them open with a flourish\u201d, that she has fallen under his sway. Blake would certainly have concurred with Pullman\u2019s satire on showily rationalistic philosophy, a scepticism so complete that it deadens the soul.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Imagination, the mysterious power celebrated by the Romantic poets, is the holy spirit of this book</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Thus, the importance of \u201cthe secret commonwealth\u201d, which is the world beyond rationality. Lyra begins to realise that it is what she has left behind in her childhood (and in the original His Dark Materials trilogy). \u201cIt was quite invisible to everyday vision \u2026 it was seen by the imagination, whatever that was, and not by logic.\u201d As one of the many advisers she meets tells her, its affairs sometimes \u201cleak through into the visible world\u201d.

The rest of the models poured out, and there were a lot of the blouses that had proved so popular last season, as well as button-down denim midi skirts. It felt very Ali McGraw \u2013 models wore headscarves or wore their hair in 70s-influenced natural-looking curls, waves and mullets. There were culottes, midi dresses and little military jackets with gold brocade and frogging that brought to mind Jimi Hendrix. There were open waistcoats over frilly blouses. For the most part the show presented a very realistic way of dressing \u2013 a double-breasted jacket, say, over a shirt tucked into flared jeans, a leather handbag worn over the shoulder. The show even made a stab at reclaiming the banker\u2019s collar \u2013 a pin-striped blue shirt with contrasting white collar \u2013 pairing it with flared jeans, a blazer and a camel-coloured leather bag. Occasionally, these same simple silhouettes were adapted to something super-luxe and embellished, as in one iteration of the Bermuda shirts which was encrusted with crystals in cappuccino and caramel. Slimane is the man who propelled Saint Laurent to commercial superstardom, and made skinny jeans happen through his work at Dior Homme. His personal aesthetic has veered towards glossy night-time glamour, with kohl-rimmed eyes and sharply-cut suits. This show doubled down on last season\u2019s bourgeoise aesthetic while adding a touch more of Slimane\u2019s rock\u2019n\u2019roll heritage, not least in the stompy gait of the coolly scowling models. The new look at Celine has bedded in.",

      "bodyText": "Eddie Jones has revealed he will not watch England\u2019s next World Cup opponents Argentina play Tonga on Saturday but plans to embark on a scouting mission of potential quarter-final rivals by attending Wales against Australia on Sunday. It is understood the head coach does not intend to change his plans in light of Piers Francis\u2019s citing for a dangerous tackle on the USA\u2019s Will Hooley with the England centre set to face a disciplinary hearing in Tokyo in the coming days. Francis will be accompanied by England\u2019s QC Richard Smith with Jones in attendance for the marquee Pool D fixture instead. England are on the same side of the draw as Wales and Australia so Jones and his coaches will get a close-up view of their likely quarter-final opponents. Argentina are playing Tonga in Osaka on Saturday \u2013 only 20 miles from Kobe, where England are currently based \u2013 before Jones\u2019s side face the Pumas in a week. Jones, however, has given his squad the weekend off and said: \u201cI won\u2019t watch that game. I\u2019ll watch other games. Argentina have very much gone back to their 2007 game. [They are a] high-kicking team, which they hadn\u2019t been.\u201d England\u2019s attack coach, Scott Wisemantel, has identified an emphasis on kicking across the tournament but none of Jones\u2019s staff are due to be in Osaka. \u201cYou look at the way teams attack and defend,\u201d he said. \u201cI am looking for space. I try to identify where there is space and come up with ideas of how I might manipulate that. There is a trend in the tournament. The accuracy of the kicking games. The better teams have better kick strategies.\u201d Francis could be ruled out of the rest of the tournament after he was cited for the incident that occurred only seven seconds into Thursday\u2019s victory. He is the fourth player cited at the World Cup following World Rugby\u2019s promised clampdown on high tackles and the governing body\u2019s public reprimand for its referees this week. Under World Rugby regulations, any sanctions that involve contact with the head warrant a mid-range entry point and therefore a minimum of six weeks. Australia\u2019s Reece Hodge and Samoa\u2019s Rey Lee-Lo were both handed six-week bans, reduced to three for mitigation. A three-week ban at the World Cup equates to three matches so Francis would not be able to play again until the semi-finals, were England to get that far. The USA flanker John Quill, who was sent off for a sickening shoulder to Owen Farrell, was on Friday given a three-match ban. Wisemantel confirmed that Farrell has no delayed after-effects of the shoulder charge. Mako Vunipola and Jack Nowell are both expected to be available to face Argentina after both came through training on Friday. With England also hopeful over Henry Slade, Jones was set to have a full complement of 31 players to select from against the Pumas, Francis\u2019s citing notwithstanding.",

      "body": "<p>Tim Watts is the product of six generations of graziers, Anzacs and pilots who could have come from the pages of Russel Ward\u2019s The Australian Legend<em>, </em>the 1950s book that distilled the mythical characteristics of the early white nation<em>.</em></p> <p>The Labor MP for Gellibrand grew up on the Darling Downs in Queensland where his ancestor John Watts was one of the first colonisers. After managing a section of land on that rich black soil, John became its first MP in the Queensland parliament in 1859.</p> <p>Another Watts ancestor, Charles Nantes, was a member of the anti-Chinese league in Geelong, which pressured the Victorian government to <a href=\"https://cv.vic.gov.au/stories/immigrants-and-emigrants/many-roads-chinese-on-the-goldfields/walking-to-the-diggings/reenacting-the-walk-from-robe/\">impose a poll tax on all Chinese passengers</a> landing there, forcing them to South Australia and to walk to the Victorian goldfields.</p> <p>In telling that history to his own children, Tim pulled a thread that led to his new book, The Golden Country, Australia\u2019s Changing Identity<em>.</em> His children are Eurasian and his wife migrated from Hong Kong right about the time John Howard was suggesting Asian migration should be \u201cslowed down a little, so the capacity of the community to absorb [was] greater\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/sep/14/there-was-no-smear-on-chinese-australians-just-a-search-for-answers\">There was no smear on Chinese Australians, just a search for answers | Katharine Murphy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The heart of the book is an attempt to reconcile the two foundations of his immediate family, wrapped in a portion of Australian history that many would rather forget.</p> <p>Watts acknowledges that \u201cthis was a mad book to write\u201d but was struck by the idea that his children may not experience his own childhood feeling of \u201cunalloyed love\u201d for Australia simply as a result of their own identity.</p> <p>\u201cThose Australian values of mateship, egalitarianism and a fair go, irreverence \u2013 I think they are still really powerful values,\u201d he says. \u201cThe reality is, though, that I think they have been denied to many people in our country over time.</p> <p>\u201cIn a time where Asian Australians \u2026 comprise some 12-13% of the population, bigger than the African American community in the US ... we really ought to have a conversation about the way that community has been treated in our country.\u201d</p> <p>The Golden Country charts the Chinese Australian experience from the gold rush and the formation of the White Australia policy. It outlines the contradictions under the Howard government, which presided over the spike in immigration that produced Watts\u2019s own diverse electorate, where more than half of his constituents were born overseas or have a parent born overseas.</p> <p>And it travels to the present where he describes a securitised immigration policy more focused on keeping people out than embracing migrants for nation building to bring people together.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2c572270ead6326bf5dea52745a4beb1d49cc997\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2c572270ead6326bf5dea52745a4beb1d49cc997/944_0_2579_3000/860.jpg\" alt=\"Labor MP Tim Watts speaks on the Migration Legislation amendment bill in the house of representatives of Parliament House Canberra, Wednesday 9 November 2016.\" width=\"860\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Labor MP Tim Watts speaks on the Migration Legislation amendment bill, Wednesday 9 November 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Bowers/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cHoward had this view that Australian identity was carved in stone by Sir Henry Parkes and passed on down to us via Charles Bean and Don Bradman, but with 100 years of defining Australians through the exclusion of Asian Australians, we have to talk about what it means to be Australian again today,\u201d Watts said.</p> <p>Watts argues Howard\u2019s \u201cculture wars\u201d on race and identity burned the progressive side of politics but, in order to talk about identity, Australians need to know their history.</p> <p>\u201cIf we deny our history, we can\u2019t understand the way we have grown to be the country we are today,\u201d Watts said. \u201cIn denying that history, really it denies the greatest achievement of Australia over the last century, which is outgrowing those beginnings.\u201d</p> <p>In outlining the Australian story, Watts quotes Australia\u2019s first two prime ministers, Edmund Barton and Alfred Deakin, among many early politicians who were united on one thing \u2013 the need to grow a white nation above all else.</p> <p>He suggests while other countries such as the United States, Canada and New Zealand have had racially exclusionary immigration laws, Australia\u2019s crafting of the White Australia policy became fundamentally entangled with our notion of self.</p> <p>\u201cOur bad luck was for the rise in racially exclusionary thinking and lawmaking to happen at our moment of federation, when we were working out what it meant to be Australian,\u201d Watts said.</p> <p>One of the leading young intellectuals of the Labor party, Watts seeks to re-imagine Australian identity for the modern age \u2013 the reality rather than the legend. He also urges a more open debate on identity.</p> <p>\u201cMy hypothesis is that Australian legend, that symbology, that idea that what it was to be Australian was to be a white man on the land, was just so powerful in our Australian identity it shaped everything,\u201d Watts says.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/audio/2019/sep/28/multiculturalism-and-our-changing-identity-australian-politics-live-podcast\">Multiculturalism and our changing identity \u2013 Australian politics live podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t had a more powerful symbol, a more powerful iconography to come along and replace it. Some people say, well, it\u2019s multiculturalism, it\u2019s a civic democracy. That\u2019s what unites us, our belief in democracy, our belief in multiculturalism. Well that just doesn\u2019t have the guts to unite the country. We can\u2019t be a nation of difference respecters. It doesn\u2019t bring a people together.\u201d</p> <p>The context for the discussion on Australian identity is tricky. But then it always is. This book could have been expected to land under a Shorten Labor government, and provide a foundation for new open but honest debate about what Australia is and what it could be.</p> <p>Instead, commentators and historians are still dissecting the Coalition win and what it means. At the same time, Australia is agonising over global tensions between China and the United States, made even more complex by anxiety over foreign interference.</p> <p>The last week of parliament, for example, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/sep/12/scott-morrison-attacks-on-gladys-liu-grubby-undertone\">dominated by the controversy</a> around Gladys Liu, the new MP for Chisholm and first Chinese Australian woman elected to the House of Representatives.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c91034f66f408dc6fb63f65bd4ad158ff410b110\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c91034f66f408dc6fb63f65bd4ad158ff410b110/0_16_6048_3630/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Prime minister Scott Morrison (L) and treasurer Josh Frydenberg (R) sit next to Liberal member for Chisholm Gladys Liu\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Prime minister Scott Morrison and treasurer Josh Frydenberg with member for Chisholm Gladys Liu.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lukas Coch/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Liu came under fire from Labor for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/sep/10/liberal-mp-gladys-liu-refuses-to-say-chinas-actions-in-south-china-sea-unlawful\">an interview</a> in which she refused to criticise the Chinese Communist party on the South China Sea and could not recall whether she had been a member of CCP propaganda organisations.

      "bodyText": "Tim Watts is the product of six generations of graziers, Anzacs and pilots who could have come from the pages of Russel Ward\u2019s The Australian Legend, the 1950s book that distilled the mythical characteristics of the early white nation. The Labor MP for Gellibrand grew up on the Darling Downs in Queensland where his ancestor John Watts was one of the first colonisers. After managing a section of land on that rich black soil, John became its first MP in the Queensland parliament in 1859. Another Watts ancestor, Charles Nantes, was a member of the anti-Chinese league in Geelong, which pressured the Victorian government to impose a poll tax on all Chinese passengers landing there, forcing them to South Australia and to walk to the Victorian goldfields. In telling that history to his own children, Tim pulled a thread that led to his new book, The Golden Country, Australia\u2019s Changing Identity. His children are Eurasian and his wife migrated from Hong Kong right about the time John Howard was suggesting Asian migration should be \u201cslowed down a little, so the capacity of the community to absorb [was] greater\u201d. The heart of the book is an attempt to reconcile the two foundations of his immediate family, wrapped in a portion of Australian history that many would rather forget. Watts acknowledges that \u201cthis was a mad book to write\u201d but was struck by the idea that his children may not experience his own childhood feeling of \u201cunalloyed love\u201d for Australia simply as a result of their own identity. \u201cThose Australian values of mateship, egalitarianism and a fair go, irreverence \u2013 I think they are still really powerful values,\u201d he says. \u201cThe reality is, though, that I think they have been denied to many people in our country over time. \u201cIn a time where Asian Australians \u2026 comprise some 12-13% of the population, bigger than the African American community in the US ... we really ought to have a conversation about the way that community has been treated in our country.\u201d The Golden Country charts the Chinese Australian experience from the gold rush and the formation of the White Australia policy. It outlines the contradictions under the Howard government, which presided over the spike in immigration that produced Watts\u2019s own diverse electorate, where more than half of his constituents were born overseas or have a parent born overseas. And it travels to the present where he describes a securitised immigration policy more focused on keeping people out than embracing migrants for nation building to bring people together. \u201cHoward had this view that Australian identity was carved in stone by Sir Henry Parkes and passed on down to us via Charles Bean and Don Bradman, but with 100 years of defining Australians through the exclusion of Asian Australians, we have to talk about what it means to be Australian again today,\u201d Watts said. Watts argues Howard\u2019s \u201cculture wars\u201d on race and identity burned the progressive side of politics but, in order to talk about identity, Australians need to know their history. \u201cIf we deny our history, we can\u2019t understand the way we have grown to be the country we are today,\u201d Watts said. \u201cIn denying that history, really it denies the greatest achievement of Australia over the last century, which is outgrowing those beginnings.\u201d In outlining the Australian story, Watts quotes Australia\u2019s first two prime ministers, Edmund Barton and Alfred Deakin, among many early politicians who were united on one thing \u2013 the need to grow a white nation above all else. He suggests while other countries such as the United States, Canada and New Zealand have had racially exclusionary immigration laws, Australia\u2019s crafting of the White Australia policy became fundamentally entangled with our notion of self. \u201cOur bad luck was for the rise in racially exclusionary thinking and lawmaking to happen at our moment of federation, when we were working out what it meant to be Australian,\u201d Watts said. One of the leading young intellectuals of the Labor party, Watts seeks to re-imagine Australian identity for the modern age \u2013 the reality rather than the legend. He also urges a more open debate on identity. \u201cMy hypothesis is that Australian legend, that symbology, that idea that what it was to be Australian was to be a white man on the land, was just so powerful in our Australian identity it shaped everything,\u201d Watts says. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had a more powerful symbol, a more powerful iconography to come along and replace it. Some people say, well, it\u2019s multiculturalism, it\u2019s a civic democracy. That\u2019s what unites us, our belief in democracy, our belief in multiculturalism. Well that just doesn\u2019t have the guts to unite the country. We can\u2019t be a nation of difference respecters. It doesn\u2019t bring a people together.\u201d The context for the discussion on Australian identity is tricky. But then it always is. This book could have been expected to land under a Shorten Labor government, and provide a foundation for new open but honest debate about what Australia is and what it could be. Instead, commentators and historians are still dissecting the Coalition win and what it means. At the same time, Australia is agonising over global tensions between China and the United States, made even more complex by anxiety over foreign interference. The last week of parliament, for example, was dominated by the controversy around Gladys Liu, the new MP for Chisholm and first Chinese Australian woman elected to the House of Representatives. Liu came under fire from Labor for an interview in which she refused to criticise the Chinese Communist party on the South China Sea and could not recall whether she had been a member of CCP propaganda organisations. Scott Morrison accused Labor of \u201ccasting a smear on Chinese Australians\u201d. Watts said the controversy again highlighted both a lack of adequate representation of Asian Australians in the parliament and the press gallery. He said Australia must get better at dealing with both structural racism and the threat of foreign interference without conflating the two. \u201cStructural racism will be with us for a while,\u201d he said. \u201cThe threat of foreign interference will be with us for a while. We have to be able to talk about both of these issues without conflating them and damaging our approach to the other one. \u201cI look back at the last week of parliament and think how different would that debate have been if we had had 30 Asian Australians across the House of Reps and the Senate, if we had had 20 plus Asian Australians in the press gallery. \u201cThe narrowness of our representation increases the stakes of this in a way that is very unfair. Look, Gladys Liu should not be the representative of the Australian Chinese community and it was extremely foolish and unfair of the prime minister to make her one.\u201d Watts is optimistic about Australia\u2019s future and believes if Australia could embrace a more updated inclusive identity, the country could position itself for the future. \u201cIf we could utilise the talents in our own nation at the cusp of the Asian century, at the edge of an Asian region, which is centre of the geostrategic contest of our time, the centre of economic growth of our time, if we could combine this incredibly diverse, young, talented population with the open liberal institutions that we have, we would be in the box seat in this nation.\u201d He looks to the power of the Uluru Statement from the Heart, which he writes \u201cseems like an articulation of the Golden Country that we could become. Whereas three stories make Australia: the Ancient Indigenous Heritage which is its foundation, the British Institutions built upon it and the adorning Gift of Multicultural Migration. Three stories make us one: Australians.\u201d The Golden Country \u2013 Australia\u2019s Changing Identity, by Tim Watts is published by Text Publishing, $32.99.",

\u201cbig data\u201d company Alqami, and door-to-door dry cleaning service Laundromap \u2013 declared losses last year.</p> <p>In a financial statement filed with the UK\u2019s Companies House, Accloud said it lost $18.7m in the 12 months to the end of March last year after writing the value of its Australian subsidiary down to zero.</p> <p>Accloud\u2019s auditor, Mahendra Pattni, raised concerns about the valuation of the company\u2019s Indian subsidiary and said the accounts did not give a true and fair view of the state of the group\u2019s affairs and did not comply with accounting standards or the companies law.</p> <p>\u201cThe Accloud operating loss was due to an accounting anomaly relating to the UK concept of nominal share value, and is not an accurate reflection on the company\u2019s underlying performance or value,\u201d Mawhinney said.</p> <p>Mynt Holdings, which owns Alqami, told the same regulator it lost \u00a3956,000 last calendar year while, in accounts filed with Asic, Laundromap said it lost $2.73m last financial year.</p> <p>Directors of both companies relied on predictions of future revenue and the continued support of shareholders to declare they were going concerns.</p> <p>Mawhinney did not answer the Guardian\u2019s questions about Mynt and Laundromap.</p> <p>Other businesses backed by Mayfair 101 include Public Democracy, which owns a database formerly used by Barack Obama\u2019s presidential campaign, a stock exchange in India and digital food ordering app and loyalty scheme Liven.</p> <p>Liven, Mynt Holdings and another Mayfair 101 investment, Malaysian internet TV play Sportsfix, all appear to be associated with cryptocurrency offerings.</p> <p>However, Mawhinney did not answer the Guardian\u2019s questions about the status of the coin offerings.</p> <h2>Reeltime Media collapse</h2> <p>Before starting Mayfair 101, Mawhinney was an executive at digital media group Reeltime Media, which collapsed in 2015.</p> <p>He was Reeltime\u2019s chief operating officer until March 2014, when the group <a href=\"https://www.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20140402/pdf/42ns2dwpzc84j3.pdf\">sacked him</a> for \u201cconduct of his that appeared antithetical to the interests of the company\u201d and said it had launched legal action against him.</p> <p>Despite the apparent bad blood, a series of corporate manoeuvres resulted in it bringing him back as chief executive in August that year.</p> <p>In April 2015 Asic moved to have the group wound up by the New South Wales supreme court after an \u201cinvestigation into allegations of corporate governance failures by RMA [Reeltime] over a number of years\u201d.</p> <p>Asic and the court refused to supply a copy of the allegations the regulator lodged with the court.</p> <p>Mawhinney said he was sacked from Reeltime after raising concerns that the company\u2019s then managing director, Gabriel Ehrenfeld, was \u201cnot acting in the best interests of the company\u2019s shareholders\u201d.</p> <p>In 2016, Asic found Ehrenfeld had a \u201cdisregard for the law and compliance with corporate regulations\u201d and <a href=\"https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2016-releases/16-156mr-asic-disqualifies-sydney-director-for-five-years/\">banned him from being a company director for five

A review by the Guardian of 11 of Mayfair 101\u2019s publicly disclosed investments shows three of them \u2013 business management software group Accloud, \u201cbig data\u201d company Alqami, and door-to-door dry cleaning service Laundromap \u2013 declared losses last year. In a financial statement filed with the UK\u2019s Companies House, Accloud said it lost $18.7m in the 12 months to the end of March last year after writing the value of its Australian subsidiary down to zero. Accloud\u2019s auditor, Mahendra Pattni, raised concerns about the valuation of the company\u2019s Indian subsidiary and said the accounts did not give a true and fair view of the state of the group\u2019s affairs and did not comply with accounting standards or the companies law. \u201cThe Accloud operating loss was due to an accounting anomaly relating to the UK concept of nominal share value, and is not an accurate reflection on the company\u2019s underlying performance or value,\u201d Mawhinney said. Mynt Holdings, which owns Alqami, told the same regulator it lost \u00a3956,000 last calendar year while, in accounts filed with Asic, Laundromap said it lost $2.73m last financial year. Directors of both companies relied on predictions of future revenue and the continued support of shareholders to declare they were going concerns. Mawhinney did not answer the Guardian\u2019s questions about Mynt and Laundromap. Other businesses backed by Mayfair 101 include Public Democracy, which owns a database formerly used by Barack Obama\u2019s presidential campaign, a stock exchange in India and digital food ordering app and loyalty scheme Liven. Liven, Mynt Holdings and another Mayfair 101 investment, Malaysian internet TV play Sportsfix, all appear to be associated with cryptocurrency offerings. However, Mawhinney did not answer the Guardian\u2019s questions about the status of the coin offerings. Reeltime Media collapse Before starting Mayfair 101, Mawhinney was an executive at digital media group Reeltime Media, which collapsed in 2015. He was Reeltime\u2019s chief operating officer until March 2014, when the group sacked him for \u201cconduct of his that appeared antithetical to the interests of the company\u201d and said it had launched legal action against him. Despite the apparent bad blood, a series of corporate manoeuvres resulted in it bringing him back as chief executive in August that year. In April 2015 Asic moved to have the group wound up by the New South Wales supreme court after an \u201cinvestigation into allegations of corporate governance failures by RMA [Reeltime] over a number of years\u201d. Asic and the court refused to supply a copy of the allegations the regulator lodged with the court. Mawhinney said he was sacked from Reeltime after raising concerns that the company\u2019s then managing director, Gabriel Ehrenfeld, was \u201cnot acting in the best interests of the company\u2019s shareholders\u201d. In 2016, Asic found Ehrenfeld had a \u201cdisregard for the law and compliance with corporate regulations\u201d and banned him from being a company director for five years. Mawhinney said he tried to save the company but it was not possible to do so because of the Asic investigation.",

      "bodyText": "Chief minister Andrew Barr describes the Australian Capital Territory\u2019s decision to legalise cannabis possession for personal use as an \u201cevolution, not a revolution\u201d. That\u2019s certainly the way Stephanie , a Canberra resident who has smoked cannabis for a year, sees it. \u201cI was under the impression it was already decriminalised,\u201d Stephanie says, describing the current penalty regime \u2013 in which possession of less than 50g is punishable by a fine but may not result in a criminal record \u2013 as \u201cless serious\u201d than in other states. But Stephanie says her mother is excited about the law change because \u201cshe was more worried about me getting caught with it, a motherly feeling that you\u2019re taking a risk with it\u201d. \u201cThis change means a risk factor has been taken away.\u201d The ACT law, to take effect at the end of January, will allow residents 18 years and over to possess up to 50 grams and grow two plants, up to a total of four plants per household. With the federal medicinal cannabis regime, introduced in 2016, still in its infancy, the ACT is ahead of the pack \u2013 one of only three jurisdictions where it is decriminalised, along with the Northern Territory and South Australia \u2013 and is now the first to legalise it. Stephanie says \u201cit\u2019s important for people younger than me, who could have had their life ruined by something they did when they were younger and more silly\u201d. But Stephanie, who works in construction, is still unwilling to give her real name because she could be subjected to drug testing at work. In addition to employment penalties, there is also the added complication that possession is still an offence in the commonwealth criminal code, and nobody can say definitively that cannabis possession will be without risk. The federal attorney general, Christian Porter, says the commonwealth offence may still apply and the Australian federal police \u2013 which polices both ACT and commonwealth law \u2013 is still considering the question. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Even the commonwealth director of public prosecutions, Sarah McNaughton, appears confused \u2013 issuing one set of advice that commonwealth law provides a defence for people engaged in conduct \u201cjustified or excused\u201d by a state or territory law \u2013 later withdrawn due to unspecified \u201clegal complexities\u201d. Michael Pettersson, the Labor member of the ACT Legislative Assembly who moved the successful private member\u2019s bill, says the ACT law was \u201cmeant to enact and empower\u201d precisely the sort of justification and excuse contemplated in commonwealth law. But there has been no detailed judicial consideration of the defence in commonwealth law and Porter says \u201cthe expectation would be commonwealth laws would be enforced\u201d \u2013 meaning it may take a test case to prove the point. While the health minister, Greg Hunt, says the federal government has \u201cno plans\u201d to directly override the law, Porter hasn\u2019t ruled it out. Pettersson says it is rewarding to see the bill, first presented in November 2018, come to fruition because \u201cit means if an adult is caught with a small amount of cannabis for their own use [they won\u2019t] need to face criminal charge\u201d. He notes that although two thirds of people caught with cannabis received fines or were diverted into a health program, the other third did \u201cgo through some level of the criminal justice system\u201d. The law has its opponents \u2013 notably the ACT Liberals and the Morrison government. On Friday, Hunt said although he will leave the legal side to Porter, he is \u201cvery concerned\u201d about the health side of the new law. \u201cWe know that the Royal College of Psychiatrists in the UK has directly linked marijuana use to psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia,\u201d he said. Hunt said cannabis had a \u201cvery significant mental health risk\u201d, citing the fact frequent users have double the likelihood of schizophrenia, and quadruple for those who started using it before the age of 15. \u201cI think the ACT has not taken these factors into account: one in four people in drug and alcohol rehabilitation in Australia have cannabis as one of the sources of their problems.\u201d The ACT shadow attorney general, Jeremy Hanson, warned during parliamentary debate that the law sends the wrong message, could increase use and the incidence of drug driving. Pettersson dismisses the concerns. \u201cThis isn\u2019t Colorado, we\u2019re not opening up retail store dispensaries,\u201d he says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t legalise the sale or supply of cannabis, it does not legalise drug driving and it does not legalise possession for children.\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s a bit disingenuous to pretend that cannabis is a rare or hard to access substance \u2026 If someone wants to use cannabis right now chances are they can use it.\u201d Pettersson cites the fact one third of Australians have used cannabis in their lifetime and one in 10 have used cannabis in the last year. Drug policy consultant Jarryd Bartle says the results of decriminalisation vary around the world under different models but \u201cgenerally, decriminalisation of the possession and use of cannabis has no effect on the number of people using cannabis\u201d. \u201cImportantly also, there is no increase and in some cases a decrease in the level of young people using cannabis in legalised jurisdictions,\u201d he says. Pettersson promises the ACT government will run a \u201clarge public health campaign\u201d before the change takes effect. \u201cIf someone has a problem with drug addiction they need to speak to a doctor and putting as few barriers to them accessing those health services as possible is a good thing.\u201d Stephanie says the law won\u2019t change her and her housemate\u2019s behaviour. \u201cWe\u2019re not exactly going to go around and flaunt it.\u201d \u201cPeople have been doing it for a while \u2026 so it really doesn\u2019t make a difference; it\u2019s just there\u2019s less risk now. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to smoke more \u2013 you can\u2019t go into a shop and buy it, it\u2019s still hard to get.

He has received no letters, but has been given two Xi Jinping books.</p> <p>Chinese officials have cited national security concerns for denying him access to his legal team for more than seven months.</p> <p>Embassy officials have passed a bible and family photographs to detention centre authorities but it\u2019s unknown if these have been passed to Yang.</p> <p>He is allowed to shower once a week, and has access to a small enclosure outside his cell \u2013 with access to fresh air and natural light \u2013 for one hour, twice a day.</p> <p>He is able to drink water when he needs it, and can purchase additional food, including fruit, biscuits, and chocolate.</p> <p>He shares his cell with two other prisoners. The lights are on in the cell at all times.</p> <p>Yang is taken from his cell once a week for interrogation, for up to four hours at a time. His hands and feet are shackled with heavy chains during questioning.</p> <p>Investigators from the ministry of state security have reportedly told him he is shackled because of the seriousness of the crimes he is alleged to have committed. He has been told he potentially faces the death penalty.</p> <p>The current investigative phase of his case, which began when he was formally charged on 23 August, could last up to seven months, until March of next year.</p> <h2>Defence hindered by lack of access</h2> <p>Yang\u2019s Beijing lawyer Mo Shaoping told the Guardian he and his colleagues had not been able to see Yang, nor received any updates from authorities since his formal arrest in August.</p> <p>Mo said they have applied five or six times to meet Yang but were refused because the case involves state secrets and their applications must be approved by China\u2019s state security organ.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we are doing now is still asking for meeting him. If the lawyers cannot meet him, we cannot understand the case.

      "bodyText": "The Australian political blogger and novelist, Yang Hengjun, is being shackled in chains and interrogated inside a Beijing detention centre, and told by authorities he could face the death penalty for espionage. Detained in China since January, Yang continues to protest his innocence to authorities and says he can clear his name if he is able to speak with senior officials in the Chinese government. Speaking exclusively to the Guardian, multiple sources have described Yang\u2019s conditions inside the ministry of state security detention centre in Beijing, where he was moved in July before being formally charged. Investigations in his case are continuing and could last until March next year. Strict conditions inside the detention centre Yang, a former Chinese government diplomat-turned-\u201cdemocracy pedlar\u201d who ran a popular and influential blog, has not been allowed access to a lawyer, and has not been permitted to speak with his family. He has received no letters, but has been given two Xi Jinping books. Chinese officials have cited national security concerns for denying him access to his legal team for more than seven months. Embassy officials have passed a bible and family photographs to detention centre authorities but it\u2019s unknown if these have been passed to Yang. He is allowed to shower once a week, and has access to a small enclosure outside his cell \u2013 with access to fresh air and natural light \u2013 for one hour, twice a day. He is able to drink water when he needs it, and can purchase additional food, including fruit, biscuits, and chocolate. He shares his cell with two other prisoners. The lights are on in the cell at all times. Yang is taken from his cell once a week for interrogation, for up to four hours at a time. His hands and feet are shackled with heavy chains during questioning. Investigators from the ministry of state security have reportedly told him he is shackled because of the seriousness of the crimes he is alleged to have committed. He has been told he potentially faces the death penalty. The current investigative phase of his case, which began when he was formally charged on 23 August, could last up to seven months, until March of next year. Defence hindered by lack of access Yang\u2019s Beijing lawyer Mo Shaoping told the Guardian he and his colleagues had not been able to see Yang, nor received any updates from authorities since his formal arrest in August. Mo said they have applied five or six times to meet Yang but were refused because the case involves state secrets and their applications must be approved by China\u2019s state security organ. \u201cWhat we are doing now is still asking for meeting him. If the lawyers cannot meet him, we cannot understand the case. You have to meet him before you can do the defence work,\u201d he said. In Australia, Yang\u2019s former doctoral supervisor Dr Feng Chongyi said there appeared to be no evidence Yang has ever been engaged in espionage, and that the charges against him were politically motivated. \u201cHe continues to protest his innocence. This is important, after many months in detention he insists he is innocent and believes he can clear his name. But his future is still very unclear.\u201d Feng, an associate professor in China Studies at the University of Technology Sydney, said Yang had not previously been restrained in manacles during interrogations. \u201cI am very concerned that his hands and feet are being shackled during interrogations, as though he is a convicted criminal awaiting execution.\u201d The Guardian understands none of Yang, his legal team, or the Australian embassy have been told the specific charges against him, or presented with any evidence of his alleged offending. The Criminal Law of the PRC details punishment for \u201ccrimes of endangering national security\u201d. Collusion with foreign states to harm China\u2019s territorial integrity, sovereignty or security attracts a prison term of at least 10 years. \u201cState organ personnel\u201d, such as diplomats, who defect and endanger national security can be jailed for between five and 10 years. But crimes that endanger national security, that have caused \u201cparticularly serious harm to the country and the people\u201d, and where \u201cthe circumstances are particularly vile\u201d, can attract the death penalty. Yang was formerly a diplomat for China\u2019s ministry of foreign affairs, before working in the private sector in Hong Kong and moving to Australia, then to the US. A writer of spy novels, he has been a popular blogger, political commentator and agitator for democratic reforms in China for more than a decade. Yang, who became an Australian citizen in 2002, had been living in the United States, where he was a visiting scholar at Columbia University, before flying to Guangzhou with his family in January. His wife and child were able to enter China, but authorities escorted Yang from the plane into detention. He was initially held under a system known as \u201cresidential surveillance at a designated location\u201d, a type of secret detention of up to six months in which authorities can deny a suspect access to lawyers and to family, and restrict external communication. In July Yang was moved to a Beijing detention centre in the lead-up to being charged. He is allowed one half-hour consular visit a month. \u2018Serious concerns\u2019 for Yang\u2019s welfare Australia\u2019s foreign minister, Marise Payne, has previously discussed Yang\u2019s case with her Chinese counterpart Wang Yi. \u201cWe have serious concerns for Dr Yang\u2019s welfare, and about the conditions under which he is being held. We have expressed these in clear terms to the Chinese authorities,\u201d Payne said last month. \u201cIt is important, and we expect, that basic standards of justice and procedural fairness are met. I respectfully reiterate my previous requests that if Dr Yang is being held for his political beliefs, he should be released.\u201d Pointedly, Payne insisted Yang had to be treated in accordance with international human rights law, \u201cwith special attention to those provisions that prohibit torture and inhumane treatment, guard against arbitrary detention and that protect the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion\u201d. A spokesman for China\u2019s foreign ministry, Geng Shuang, last month said Yang\u2019s arrest had been handled in accordance with the law and that the Australian citizen was in good health. Geng also warned Australia against \u201cinterference\u201d in the case. \u201cChina deplores the Australian statement on this case \u2026 the Australian side should earnestly respect China\u2019s judicial sovereignty and must not ... interfere with a Chinese case,\u201d he said. From detention, Yang has pleaded for Australian help. \u201cPlease help me go home as soon as possible,\u201d he said in a message relayed through a consular official.",

The real issue was the defenestration of Adkins, a popular and successful incumbent with an agreeable, slightly careworn manner, less elite level football manager, more browbeaten provincial scoutmaster who keeps terrapins.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/26/mauricio-pochettino-nothing-broken-mindset-changes\">Spurs have to fix collateral damage even if Pochettino says \u2018nothing is broken\u2019 | David Hytner</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Before kick-off St Mary\u2019s was in a state of high alert. Any traces of Adkins imagery had been expunged, Stalin-style, from the club programme. In the streets club officials \u201cshut down\u201d radio crews looking for Adkins vox pops, as though simply whispering those incendiary words might spark spasms of rage among the Adkins razor gangs roaming the backstreets, or the highly organised Adkins ultras massing at their motorway meet points.</p> <p>Except, it didn\u2019t quite work out like that. The home crowd was orderly and polite. A chorus of \u201cJason Puncheon \u2013 he\u2019s gone for a piss\u201d as Puncheon emerged late for the second half was as close as we got to rabble-rousing.

Spend less, finish higher</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Pochettino would later describe that first night at Southampton as \u201cthe most difficult moment of my life\u201d. You couldn\u2019t tell. Instead he looked assured, striding about with that familiar Poch charisma, a kind of chest-pumping gaucho manliness that makes you want to cuff him on the shoulders, clap his cheeks, arm-wrestle him, drink in his bristly eau de homme as he whispers inspiring words in your ear about struggle and suffering, before telling you to get up off your knees, wipe away the tears, get out of his office and in future make an appointment.</p> <p>Fast forward almost seven years and Pochettino is now in his own state of retrenchment, perhaps even an Adkins-style turnaround. Tottenham have won seven of 26 games since February. That fearless pressing game has retreated.

      "bodyText": "Remember the Nigel Adkins riots? I was there when it all went down. Although to be fair, this is probably stretching the definition of \u201cgoing down\u201d. It seems strange now how febrile the atmosphere was around Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s first game in English football at Southampton back in January 2013, an evening kick-off against Everton set against an entirely overblown sense of lurking civil disorder. Pochettino\u2019s arrival was just a part of this. The real issue was the defenestration of Adkins, a popular and successful incumbent with an agreeable, slightly careworn manner, less elite level football manager, more browbeaten provincial scoutmaster who keeps terrapins. Before kick-off St Mary\u2019s was in a state of high alert. Any traces of Adkins imagery had been expunged, Stalin-style, from the club programme. In the streets club officials \u201cshut down\u201d radio crews looking for Adkins vox pops, as though simply whispering those incendiary words might spark spasms of rage among the Adkins razor gangs roaming the backstreets, or the highly organised Adkins ultras massing at their motorway meet points. Except, it didn\u2019t quite work out like that. The home crowd was orderly and polite. A chorus of \u201cJason Puncheon \u2013 he\u2019s gone for a piss\u201d as Puncheon emerged late for the second half was as close as we got to rabble-rousing. Otherwise there was a general sense of curiosity and respectful applause for the new man, this bear-like, oddly stirring figure on the touchline. Pochettino would later describe that first night at Southampton as \u201cthe most difficult moment of my life\u201d. You couldn\u2019t tell. Instead he looked assured, striding about with that familiar Poch charisma, a kind of chest-pumping gaucho manliness that makes you want to cuff him on the shoulders, clap his cheeks, arm-wrestle him, drink in his bristly eau de homme as he whispers inspiring words in your ear about struggle and suffering, before telling you to get up off your knees, wipe away the tears, get out of his office and in future make an appointment. Fast forward almost seven years and Pochettino is now in his own state of retrenchment, perhaps even an Adkins-style turnaround. Tottenham have won seven of 26 games since February. That fearless pressing game has retreated. And Pochettino himself seems to have reached the end of something. He\u2019s fretful with his players. He talks a lot about budgetary restrictions and his own yawn-worthy struggle with the media (who adore him). He has, in effect, become just another football manager. And football managers are dispensable. Poch must go: this unlikely notion is increasingly being floated around the place. It is a strange, sudden kind of collapse. Strange because the feeling is still there that he\u2019s just getting started. But look up and the years have flown. If Pochettino stays to the end of the season he will be Spurs\u2019 joint-second longest-serving manager since the first world war. Is it really time? Unexpectedly, the answer might just be yes. Not that there\u2019s anything wrong with that. This is something new in elite football. For so long it seemed there was too much flux. Suddenly we have a problem with people leaving, a sense of resistance, of profitable congealment. Manchester United, a possible Poch destination, have spent six years basically hiring and firing the same structurally doomed manager \u2013 different face, same macro-problems \u2013 while continuing to exist in a state of profitable stasis. Pochettino isn\u2019t in it for the money.

Even the 2-2 draw at Chelsea in May 2016 when Spurs still might have won the league, when nine players were booked and a two-goal lead lost, still felt like evidence of energy, life, hunger. To live is to suffer, that relentless physicality seemed to say. To survive is to find some meaning in the suffering. But what did it mean? The achievement here is always contextual. For all its emotional power, it remains a feat of hair-shirt economics. Spend less, finish higher. Spurs got rid of 20 players in the two windows after that Chelsea game.

At 2:35pm GMT the men\u2019s 100m preliminary round will begin, before Brits Zharnel Hugues, Ojie Edoburun and Adam Gemili enter the competition at the heats from 4:05pm GMT. All eyes will be on the budding rivalry between 2017 silver medalist Christian Coleman and Noah Lyles.</p> <p>From 2:40pm, Doha will see a flurry of women\u2019s qualification events starting with two groups of hammer throw. Britain\u2019s Holly Bradshaw will then attempt to make another final in women\u2019s pole vault qualifications, before the women\u2019s high jump qualification and 3000m Steeplechase heats. Later, the block of men events will include triple jump qualification from 5:25pm, 5000m heats and 400m hurdles heats. In the evening session, the first day will close with the midnight women\u2019s marathon final.</p> <p>Before a single metre has been run or a throw landed, this has already been a controversial championships with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/may/22/qatar-tv-channel-chief-world-athletics-championships-corruption-investigation\">suspected corruption</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/25/iaaf-world-athletics-championships-qatar\">searing temperatures</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/23/migrant-workers-children-world-athletics-championships-tickets-crowd\">poor sales</a> all marring the buildup.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from me today. I\u2019ll be back tomorrow, where the men\u2019s 100 metres will conclude and Dina Asher-Smith will make her long-awaited first appearance in the women\u2019s 200 metres heats. Exciting times. And here is Sean Ingle\u2019s report from Doha. Teenage sensation Jakob Ingebrigtsen has been disqualified from the 5000m final after stepping out of bounds during the first heat. It seems like he may have been pushed and there may yet be another appeal, but as it stands Britain\u2019s Andrew Butchart has qualified in his place for the 5000m final. Michael Johnson on the 100m favourite Christian Coleman: Given what we\u2019ve seen now, I just can\u2019t see that anyone is going to be able to run with him when we get to the final because he is the class of the field. Chris McAlister couldn\u2019t really believe it: It\u2019s an awesome feeling. I\u2019m a worlds semifinalist! That\u2019s not gonna sink in for a long time. I\u2019ve come a long way this year \u2014 I wasn\u2019t really expecting this but it\u2019s awesome. McAlister will likely have to run a personal best to advance further, but he\u2019s ready for it. I think it\u2019s there to be honest. I messed up a little bit today. Still got my strides in but it was good \u2014 good fight and good fun. Britain\u2019s Chris McAlister produces a spirited run to reach the 400m semi-final. And what a run it was. 15 metres from the line in heat 5, McAlister was miles away from fourth place. But as Turkey\u2019s Yasmani Copello relaxed, McAlister fought hard, dipped harder and beat him on the line in 49.73. We\u2019re in 2019 and athletes are still failing to dip on the line. Madness. Elsewhere, Rai Benjamin, the third titan of 400m hurdles, eased through the fourth heat in 49.62. The sound of crickets when Abderrahman Samba was announced to his home crowd was an amusing reflection of how few home fans are in the arena, but Samba\u2019s measured 49.08 win in heat 3 was no joke. TJ Holmes of United States blew out of the blocks so quickly and led for most of the race, but both Samba and Japan\u2019s Takatoshi Abe calmly caught him by the end. Kyron McMaster of the British Virgin Islands takes the second 400m hurdles heat with a time of 49.60. Another of the big talents, home star Abderrahman Samba, will be in the third heat. Samba has a personal best of 46.98 and he is Qatar\u2019s big medal hope but he comes with some injury doubts. We\u2019ll see. Some quick maths. In one of the least surprising results of the day, Karsten Warholm eases through the first 400m hurdles heat in 49.27. Good work from Thomas Barr of Ireland to move through in second place with a time of 49.41. The first four advance to tomorrow\u2019s semis. Meanwhile, Jakob Ingebrigtsen has been confirmed in the 5000m final. It\u2019s time for the final track event of the session, and easily one of the most exciting. The men\u2019s 400m hurdles event will feature three of the four fastest of all time, starting with the world leader Karsten Warholm. Paul Chelimo wins a gritty, tight second 5000m heat with a time of 13:20.18. Both Filip and Henrik Ingebrigtsen are through in this heat, and the two brothers are determined to show the whole world how happy they are about it. However, there is some doubt over the first heat after Jakob Ingebrigtsen took a few steps out of bounds during the race. If Jakob goes out, Andrew Butchart gets in as a fast loser. Beautiful. Meanwhile, the men\u2019s triple jump is being led by Pedro Pablo Pichardo of Portugal with a distance of 17.38m. World and Olympic champion Christian Taylor of the United States isn\u2019t having his greatest day at the office, but his mark of 16.99m still leaves him in third place despite being short of the 17.10m automatic qualifying mark. It must be nice to know that your average day is still that good. What a brutal battle in the first men\u2019s 5000m heat. Salemon Barega takes it in 13:24.69 with just a second separating the first six finishers. Unfortunately, it was Britain\u2019s Andrew Butchart who was run out in seventh and will have to wait to see if he gets in as a fast loser. But the moment was stolen far from the front. By the final lap, Jonathan Busby of Aruba could barely stand upright, let alone run, but Guinea Bissau\u2019s Braima Suncar Dabo put an arm around his colleague and carried him 120 metres to the finishing line. They finished almost 5 minutes later and it was lovely. After Hyvin Kiyeng of Kenya won the final women\u2019s 3000m steeplechase heat in 9:29.15, it\u2019s time for some men\u2019s 5000m heats. Andrew Butchart and Marc Scott are the British runners in the first heat. With no British qualifiers in the steeplechase, we\u2019ll see what he can do in this stacked race including formidable athletes like Jakob Ingebrigtsen, Mohammed Ahmed, Birhanu Balew and Salemon Barega. In the women\u2019s high jump qualifying, Britain\u2019s Morgan Lake is out of qualifying after three fails at 1.89m. Heavy favourite Mariya Lasitskene also surprisingly failed to clear her first attempt of 1.89m, but she got it done on her second turn. Beatrice Chepkoech of Kenya wins the second women\u2019s 3000m steeplechase heat in 9:18.01. In another brutal heat, in which four women ran under 9:19, Britain\u2019s Elizabeth Bird takes 6 seconds off her personal best with a time of 9:30.13, finishing in sixth. Rosie Clarke will be Britain\u2019s final entry in the third heat. The formidable trio of Peruth Chemutai, Emma Coburn and Celliphine Chepteek Chespol eased through in heat one of the steeplechase. Good work for 21 year-old Brit Aimee Pratt, who left with a personal best of 9:38.91. She spoke to the BBC afterwards: I\u2019m definitely aiming to qualify [for Tokyo 2020]. I\u2019m not that far away. It\u2019s definitely achievable within the year. I just have to stay healthy and injury free. Holly Bradshaw finally gets her tracksuit off and enters the pole vault qualifying, clearing 4.60m at the first opportunity with ease. With just one vault today, she\u2019s into the final. That\u2019s how you do it. Elsewhere, the women\u2019s high jump is underway and Britain\u2019s Morgan Lake is safely through her first jump of 1.80. It\u2019s time for a few 3000m steeplechase heats. Britain\u2019s Aimee Pratt will be in the first heat alongside the 2017 world champion Emma Coburn. Celliphine Chepteek Chespol of Kenya and Uganda\u2019s Peruth Chemutai will also be ones to watch in this first heat. Some great news for Britain\u2019s Ojie Edoburun, who lives to fight another day by taking the final qualifying place with his time of 10.23. We can conclude that this will not be the magical innovation that brings an army of new fans to athletics. Christian Coleman, fastest man in the world this year, is the first man to produce a sub-10 time in Doha by winning heat 6 in 9.98 seconds. That was a message that the rest of the field undoubtedly heard. He looks more than ready. Paulo Andre Camilo de Oliveira of Brazil takes heat 5 with a time of 10.11. Now, it\u2019s time to see how Christian Coleman is looking in the final heat. He\u2019s up against two other athletes who have dipped under 10 seconds this year, Abdul Hakim Sani Brown of Japan and Mario Burke of Barbados. Meanwhile on the field, women\u2019s pole vault is underway but the ever-present Holly Bradshaw is just chilling on the ground. It looks fun. The Brit comes in with the joint fourth highest season best of 4.81m and she won\u2019t join until 4.60. We\u2019re at 4.50 now. Yohan Blake and Jimmy Vicaut, two talented and injury-affected big sprinters, take the top two places of Heat 4 in 10.07 and 10.08. He certainly looked well prepared today. Amusingly, Zharnel Hughes said he was shivering in the air-conditioned stadium after training in the heat. He put his slow start down to the starting blocks: I have to be aware of the block settings. It was a bit different from the one that I\u2019m currently using. But I won\u2019t let that hamper me and I\u2019m looking forward to the next rounds. Zharnel Hughes waltzes into the semis in first place with 10.08. Hugues had a pretty dire start and was lagging early on, but he tore through to finish first. Impressive. Gemili said he was clashing hands with Aussie Rohan Browning through the race, but he\u2019s happy: It was more like a semifinal, the people in that field. World championships, it\u2019s never going to be easy but glad to be through... Badly executed run but stuff to work on! He ended with a shrug. He is not wrong. Justin Gatlin takes the second 100m heat in 10.06. Solid run from Adam Gemili to qualify in third with 10.19. Gemili didn\u2019t seem to react well to the gun but he came through well and remained calm. This will be a tough, tough heat 2 for Adam Gemili. Justin Gatlin, Andre De Grasse, Tyquendo Tracey and Usheoritse Itsekiri have all run faster than his 10.04 this year. Stacked. Akani Simbine of South Africa eases through the first heat in 10.01. That was quite impressive. However, it was a tough race for Britain\u2019s Ojie Edoburun, who started well but fell away to finish in 5th in 10.23. It will be tough to see him advance. It\u2019s almost time for the 100m heats. Here is some required reading on the fastest man of 2019, USA\u2019s Christian Coleman, who missed three drug tests and just avoided a ban on a technicality. What a ragged race. It was a slow, slow start with a 63 second opening lap. Up until 50 metres to go, Sharp looked comfortable on the shoulder of Renelle Lamote. But as Rose Mary Almanza and Rababe Arafi kicked for the finish, Sharp just had nothing and was passed by both. Sharp\u2019s time of 2:03.57 will not be enough. What a surprise - Sharp had highest season best of her heat by quite a distance. Lynsey Sharp is out of the World Championships! Despite the scare, Bell chuckled as she talked to the BBC: Nothing like a bit of excitement get the party started! I got myself in a bad position with 200 to go... I got to the 100 there was nowhere to go so I made the move to go wide and just relied on myself and my sprint finish... I\u2019ll have a look back at where I went wrong and bring something better tomorrow. Britain\u2019s Alexandra bell qualifies for the semi-final by the skin of her neck in third place. What a messy race that was! With about 200 metres to go, Bell was far back in the pack and blocked in, but eventually she decided to veer wide of the group and she sprinted through to snatch third place at the end. Nataliya Prishchepa of Ukraine took it in the end. As 21 year-old favourite Juan Miguel Echevarria chills somewhere cool after obliterating the men\u2019s long jump qualifying field in his opening jump, the rest wasn\u2019t the greatest competition. Nobody else crossed the automatic mark of 8.15. Jeff Henderson of the United States was the second highest qualifier with 8:12. Defending champ Luvo Manyonga just about qualified with the final with 7.91. After heat 3 and heat 4 were won by Winnie Nanyondo of Uganda and Jamaica\u2019s Natoya Goule respectively, there will be some more British interest in the final two women\u2019s 800m heats. Alexandra Bell is coming in heat 5 and Lynsey Sharp will be a favourite in heat 6. Between heaving gulps of air, Oskan-Clarke seemed pleased: Tactically, it was hard. I wasn\u2019t in the best position from the start then just trying to make sure I didn\u2019t get too complacent. [I was] working a little too hard on the back straight but I secured my spot so I\u2019m happy with that. Cool finish from Britain\u2019s Shelayna Oskan-Clarke to qualify second in heat two behind Raevyn Rogers. Oskan-Clarke was in a pretty dire place with 150m to go, trapped on the inside of the group, but she came through really well in the final 40m. Much like her compatriot Wilson in the first heat, Rogers controlled the race from start to finish. That was impressive. Things are starting to warm up on the track. The 800m heats are underway, with event favourite Ajee Wilson of the United States winning the first race in 2:02.10. Uganda\u2019s Halimah Nakaayi and Christina Hering took second and third. Wilson is such an elegant runner and she led from the front throughout, controlling the tempo of the race and then edging away from the field with 100m to go. Easy peasy. First three in each heat and the six fastest losers advance here. This is where we pretend to be shocked. For the men\u2019s long jump, the qualifiers will have to record a distance of 8.15 or else finish in the top 12 today. Defending champ Luvo Manyonga will have to improve on his own first round of 7.87. In the men\u2019s long jump, what an ominous start from 21 year-old Juan Miguel Echevarria. Echevarria is the clear favourite and comes into the event with a world lead of 8.65m. He calmly lands a distance of 8.40 in his opening jump. As if the field wasn\u2019t already aware, he is here to win. We\u2019re finally underway and the 100 metres prelims are on the track. So far, Taymir Burnet of the Netherlands won the first preliminary heat with 10.23 and South Korea\u2019s Kukyoung Kim took the second with 10.32. First place in each heat and the next five fastest will all make it to the main heats later today. BBC\u2019s Michael Johnson was perceptive as ever on the subject of athletics moving on after Usain Bolt: \u201cAny time someone shows some personality on the track, the first thing people say is: \u2018the sport needs that, this is what the sport needs!\u2019 We had the best showman ever in sport, for 10 years, Usain Bolt. Did this sport end up improving because of that? No. We\u2019re still in the situation where the sport needs better marketing. \u201cWe need to focus more on the competition between the athletes as opposed to finding another Usain Bolt and just putting all of the attention on him... [Bolt] didn\u2019t bring more sponsors in the sport, didn\u2019t create more media around the sport. When he left, all of the following for Usain Bolt went with Usain Bolt.\u201d As we wait for the first competitions to begin, here\u2019s an investigation by Sean Ingle into the controversy surrounding Qatar\u2019s acquisition of this event. Don\u2019t be fooled by the size of the Doha crowds. Sean Ingle also reported that, by Monday, just 50,000 tickets had been sold for the 10 day event. Business isn\u2019t exactly booming considering the Khalifa International Stadium seats 40,000 people. Some required reading from the esteemed Sean Ingle on the attempts to keep athletes from melting under the Qatari heat in its upcoming major events. Britain\u2019s Tish Jones is out of the women\u2019s marathon. Hello! Welcome to day one of the World Athletics Championships in Doha, where we are by no means starting off slowly. The opening afternoon session will kick off with the men\u2019s long jump qualifying, where 21 year-old Juan Miguel Echevarria is favourite to become the first Cuban world champion since 2001. At 2:35pm GMT the men\u2019s 100m preliminary round will begin, before Brits Zharnel Hugues, Ojie Edoburun and Adam Gemili enter the competition at the heats from 4:05pm GMT. All eyes will be on the budding rivalry between 2017 silver medalist Christian Coleman and Noah Lyles. From 2:40pm, Doha will see a flurry of women\u2019s qualification events starting with two groups of hammer throw. Britain\u2019s Holly Bradshaw will then attempt to make another final in women\u2019s pole vault qualifications, before the women\u2019s high jump qualification and 3000m Steeplechase heats. Later, the block of men events will include triple jump qualification from 5:25pm, 5000m heats and 400m hurdles heats. In the evening session, the first day will close with the midnight women\u2019s marathon final. Before a single metre has been run or a throw landed, this has already been a controversial championships with suspected corruption, searing temperatures and poor sales all marring the buildup. But in the Khalifa International Stadium at least, the athletes will be fully zoned in on an exciting 10 days to come.

      "body": "<p>The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, is narrowing the focus of the impeachment inquiry to focus on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-impeachment-inquiry\">Trump-Ukraine scandal</a>, as the White House reels from one of the most tempestuous weeks of <a href=\"https://www.thegdian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a>\u2019s presidency.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/26/slug-trump-ukraine-latest-whistleblower-complaint-2020-election\">White House tried to cover up Trump's Ukraine conversation, whistleblower alleges</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/26/slug-trump-ukraine-latest-whistleblower-complaint-2020-election\">The revelations</a> that Trump pushed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">Ukraine</a>\u2019s president, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/volodymyr-zelenskiy\">Volodymyr Zelenskiy</a>, to investigate a political rival \u2013 and a whistleblower\u2019s accusation that the White House then attempted a cover-up \u2013 will now serve as the main thrust of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats\">Democrats</a>\u2019 investigation, according to reports.</p> <p>In narrowing the investigation, from a wide-ranging examination of the lengthy Trump-Russia investigation, Pelosi is said to be hoping for a quicker resolution to the impeachment inquiry. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/democrats-eye-quick-impeachment-probe-of-trump-as-freshmen-push-for-focus-on-ukraine/2019/09/26/66f50b20-e089-11e9-8dc8-498eabc129a0_story.html\">The Washington Post</a>, citing Democrats and congressional aides, said Pelosi has instructed House committees to file the results of their individual investigations within weeks.</p> <p>That could build towards a vote around Thanksgiving, reports suggested. The celebration, always on the fourth Thursday in November, falls on 28 November this year.</p> <p>Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House intelligence committee, said on Friday he will oversee hearings next week \u2013 a period which had originally been set aside as a congressional recess. Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, and William Barr, the attorney general, are set to be called to testify before the panel.</p> <p>Democrats\u2019 acceleration of their investigation came as Donald Trump sought to disparage both the whistleblower and those who provided the whistleblower with information.</p> <p>\u201cSounding more and more like the so-called whistleblower isn\u2019t a whistleblower at all.\u201d Trump tweeted, providing no evidence for his claim.</p> <p>\u201cIn addition, all second hand information that proved to be so inaccurate that there may not have even been somebody else, a leaker or spy, feeding it to him or her? A partisan operative?\u201d</p> <p>In the complaint, the whistleblower said their information came from national security officials with knowledge of Trump\u2019s actions.</p> <p>Despite Trump\u2019s attempt to discredit the whistleblower, on Friday the White House confirmed a key aspect of the complaint. A senior White House official <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mkraju/status/1177592698636656640\">acknowledged to CNN</a> that the Trump administration has previously used a separate classified system to house important documents, including the transcript of the president\u2019s Ukraine call.</p> <p>The attacks on the whistleblower\u2019s credibility appeared to be a deliberate ploy, one Republicans are likely to return to as the investigation continues. Senior White House adviser Kellyanne Conway said it was a \u201cstretch\u201d to refer to the whistleblower as such, while Giuliani diminished the allegations and said that, in fact, he was a \u201clegitimate whistleblower\u201d in the saga.</p> <p>The fallout from the whistleblower\u2019s complaint and the release of the transcript of the Trump-Zelenskiy call continued on Friday. More than 300 former national security officials signed a statement condemning Trump\u2019s actions, as reports suggested the White House knew of the whistleblower\u2019s complaint more than a week before it was formally referred to the justice department.</p> <p>\u201cPresident Trump appears to have leveraged the authority and resources of the highest office in the land to invite additional foreign interference into our democratic processes,\u201d the officials, who include people who have worked in both Republican and Democratic governments, <a href=\"https://nationalsecurityaction.org/newsroom/national-security-professionals-impeachment\">wrote</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThat would constitute an unconscionable abuse of power.\u201d</p> <p>Trump continued to criticize the media and defend his discussion with Zelenskiy.</p> <p>\u201cI had a simple and very nice call with with the new President of Ukraine, it could not have been better or more honorable, and the Fake News Media and Democrats, working as a team, have fraudulently made it look bad.

A continuing Witch Hunt!\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1177543516236500997\">the president tweeted</a>.</p> <p>The complaint by an unnamed whistleblower was released on Thursday.

According to the complaint the White House intervened to \u201clock down\u201d the transcript of the July call between Trump and Zelenskiy, in which Trump pressured Zelenskiy to investigate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden\">Joe Biden</a>.</p> <p>\u201cIn the course of my official duties, I have received information from multiple US government officials that the president of the United States is using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 US election,\u201d the whistleblower wrote.</p> <p>The complaint was released as the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, testified before the House intelligence committee.

      "bodyText": "The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, is narrowing the focus of the impeachment inquiry to focus on the Trump-Ukraine scandal, as the White House reels from one of the most tempestuous weeks of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency. The revelations that Trump pushed Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to investigate a political rival \u2013 and a whistleblower\u2019s accusation that the White House then attempted a cover-up \u2013 will now serve as the main thrust of Democrats\u2019 investigation, according to reports. In narrowing the investigation, from a wide-ranging examination of the lengthy Trump-Russia investigation, Pelosi is said to be hoping for a quicker resolution to the impeachment inquiry. The Washington Post, citing Democrats and congressional aides, said Pelosi has instructed House committees to file the results of their individual investigations within weeks. That could build towards a vote around Thanksgiving, reports suggested. The celebration, always on the fourth Thursday in November, falls on 28 November this year. Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House intelligence committee, said on Friday he will oversee hearings next week \u2013 a period which had originally been set aside as a congressional recess. Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, and William Barr, the attorney general, are set to be called to testify before the panel. Democrats\u2019 acceleration of their investigation came as Donald Trump sought to disparage both the whistleblower and those who provided the whistleblower with information. \u201cSounding more and more like the so-called whistleblower isn\u2019t a whistleblower at all.\u201d Trump tweeted, providing no evidence for his claim. \u201cIn addition, all second hand information that proved to be so inaccurate that there may not have even been somebody else, a leaker or spy, feeding it to him or her? A partisan operative?\u201d In the complaint, the whistleblower said their information came from national security officials with knowledge of Trump\u2019s actions. Despite Trump\u2019s attempt to discredit the whistleblower, on Friday the White House confirmed a key aspect of the complaint. A senior White House official acknowledged to CNN that the Trump administration has previously used a separate classified system to house important documents, including the transcript of the president\u2019s Ukraine call. The attacks on the whistleblower\u2019s credibility appeared to be a deliberate ploy, one Republicans are likely to return to as the investigation continues. Senior White House adviser Kellyanne Conway said it was a \u201cstretch\u201d to refer to the whistleblower as such, while Giuliani diminished the allegations and said that, in fact, he was a \u201clegitimate whistleblower\u201d in the saga. The fallout from the whistleblower\u2019s complaint and the release of the transcript of the Trump-Zelenskiy call continued on Friday. More than 300 former national security officials signed a statement condemning Trump\u2019s actions, as reports suggested the White House knew of the whistleblower\u2019s complaint more than a week before it was formally referred to the justice department. \u201cPresident Trump appears to have leveraged the authority and resources of the highest office in the land to invite additional foreign interference into our democratic processes,\u201d the officials, who include people who have worked in both Republican and Democratic governments, wrote. \u201cThat would constitute an unconscionable abuse of power.\u201d Trump continued to criticize the media and defend his discussion with Zelenskiy. \u201cI had a simple and very nice call with with the new President of Ukraine, it could not have been better or more honorable, and the Fake News Media and Democrats, working as a team, have fraudulently made it look bad. It wasn\u2019t bad, it was very legal and very good. A continuing Witch Hunt!\u201d the president tweeted. The complaint by an unnamed whistleblower was released on Thursday. The whistleblower alleged that Trump\u2019s actions on Ukraine \u201cpose risks to US national security\u201d. According to the complaint the White House intervened to \u201clock down\u201d the transcript of the July call between Trump and Zelenskiy, in which Trump pressured Zelenskiy to investigate Joe Biden. \u201cIn the course of my official duties, I have received information from multiple US government officials that the president of the United States is using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 US election,\u201d the whistleblower wrote. The complaint was released as the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, testified before the House intelligence committee. Maguire said he had initially been blocked by the White House from releasing the complaint to Congress. In his opening remarks on Thursday Maguire said the situation was \u201ctotally unprecedented\u201d, later saying the whistleblower had \u201cdone the right thing\u201d. The New York Times reported that the White House was alerted to the detail of the complaint a week before it was formally referred. The lawyer shared the whistleblower\u2019s allegations with the White House, following normal procedure, as the formal complaint moved up the intelligence community ladder. The news \u2013 confirmed by CNN reporting \u2013 that the White House had prior knowledge of the accusations in the complaint is likely to raise questions about how the Trump administration then sought to delay its release. The complaint details how the White House sought to block access to the transcript of the call with Zelenskiy \u2013 in which Trump asked the Ukraine president to \u201cdo us a favor\u201d and offered help in investigating Joe Biden, a potential 2020 presidential rival. A number of different House committees \u2013 led by Democrats \u2013 were already investigating Trump for impeachable actions, based on special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Trump-Russia investigation. At a private event in New York on Thursday, the president lashed out at those who helped to inform the whistleblower and alluded to retaliation. In audio obtained and released by the Los Angeles Times, Trump says: \u201cWho\u2019s the person that gave the whistleblower the information? Because that\u2019s close to a spy. You know what we used to do in the old days, when we were smart, right? The spies and treason? We used to handle it a little differently than we do now.\u201d Pelosi accused the White House of a cover-up. \u2022 This article was amended on 30 September 2019 because an earlier version was incorrect to say that Thanksgiving is always on the \u201clast Thursday in November\u201d. It is celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November which is not always the last Thursday in that month.",

      "body": "<p><em>Scott Morrison has made his first visit to the United States as prime minister. It was a trip that included a close encounter with the unpredictability of the Trump White House, a foreign policy pivot, and a backlash about a lack of climate policy action. Guardian Australia\u2019s political editor, Katharine Murphy, travelled, with the prime minister</em><em>. Here is what she witnessed:</em></p> <h2><strong>Washington</strong></h2> <p>We\u2019ve been positioned at the White House since 5am, watching the sun creep over the American capital. Security is as laborious as you\u2019d expect. Dogs sniff bags, then the secret service guys have a good look, passports are collected, checked and returned, White House passes and pins are distributed, and then at last we clear the metal detectors. Eventually we make it to the press briefing room, the small blue one, famous through several presidential administrations but now abandoned by Donald Trump. The modest proportions don\u2019t fit his presidency. Now it\u2019s just a transit zone.</p> <p>We are greeted by a blond woman in a broad-brimmed hat. June, a self-described southern belle, is receiving visitors in the briefing room, although it\u2019s not clear why. She identifies herself as a fellow scribe working for Christian radio and television in Nashville. When she\u2019s not reporting on the Trump White House, she\u2019s rallying Christians for the president. This seems something of a line cross for a reporter with White House press accreditation \u2013 but we\u2019ve been on the premises for about 10 minutes and it\u2019s clear that we\u2019re not in Kansas any more.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"daf582dae43b5f8ef2e4c0082c1218e2073997e3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/daf582dae43b5f8ef2e4c0082c1218e2073997e3/0_0_4928_2768/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald and Melania Trump welcome Scott and Jenny Morrison on the south lawn with full military honours.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"562\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald and Melania Trump welcome Scott and Jenny Morrison on the south lawn with full military honours.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: MAI/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On the other side of the building, visitors are streaming across the South Lawn to grab prime positions to witness The Donald receiving The Scott at the official welcome. Flags, American and Australian, are held aloft on a glorious summery day. Eventually we are permitted to wander down to the lawn as well.</p> <p>The Donald\u2019s grass is lush and slightly dewy, making me regret my choice of footwear. The daylight is now dazzling but the bucolic scene is disturbed by Austin rebuking Steve in the media pen. The confrontation happens just before the splendidly peppy pipe band strides across the lawn for the ceremonial welcome.</p> <p>I\u2019ve never met Austin before this moment but he looks about 30, buttoned down and watchful as a raptor \u2013 a White House wrangler who looks as though he hasn\u2019t sat down, eaten anything apart from a protein bar, or slept more than four hours straight a night since early infancy. Steve has transgressed and Austin convenes a short, sharp show trial in front of me. I\u2019ve nabbed a prime position on the fence in the media pen right in front of the entrance, and I don\u2019t intend to move unless the secret service guy standing beside me gets feisty.</p> <p>\u201cYou left the media area to make a call,\u201d Austin says, voice appropriately low so as not to disdain the Wonderful Occasion swelling around us. Steve is older than his accuser and possesses the rumpled look of a longtime print or news wire reporter. I\u2019ve never seen Steve before either, but he\u2019s clearly part of the White House press pool and looks like a man disinclined to small talk. My guess, from my quick scan of the body language, the suppressed inner sigh, is that Steve has seen a number of Austins in his reporting lifetime, perhaps a small production line of them, and is not much gripped by this power play.</p> <p>Steve says nothing. Austin persists. In a minute we are going to go full Veep. \u201cThe secret service told me you left the media area to make a call \u2013 is this correct?\u201d Steve, at the end of his tolerance for <em>J\u2019Accuse</em> now, delivers his mic drop. \u201cYah,\u201d he says. \u201cOne of the secret service guys held back the rope so I could get out to make the call. I needed to take the call.\u201d I suspect Austin doesn\u2019t really know where to take this from here. The aide returns to the front of the fence, shoulders back, eyes front. It\u2019s showtime.</p> <p>Trump strides out of the White House with Melania. From my vantage point they look like a pair of Easter Island statues. This is my first encounter with the current leader of the free world and my curiosity is intense. How will Trump look uncut?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"917cb2dc401ffc82b25a3639766fd55d74985a23\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/917cb2dc401ffc82b25a3639766fd55d74985a23/0_0_4025_2683/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald and Melania Trump arrive to greet Scott Morrison.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald and Melania Trump arrive to greet Scott Morrison.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mick Tsikas/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Will he look how he does on television, with that weird affect \u2013 the pursed lips, narrowed eyes and nose and chin set to an upward inflection, indicative of defiance and displeasure? Or is this a posture he adopts only after he pulls on the presidential onesie every day and heads for Fox News, purring \u201cready for my close-up Mr DeMille\u201d?</p> <p>I discover this is how Trump looks all the time, or at least all the time he is in open space. He\u2019s striding to the podium with exactly that look, with Melania, who is a dignified presence yet strangely devoid of life force. Perhaps she laughs and sings and dances in her track pants like no one is watching in her private domain but, in public, Mrs Trump looks like a perfectly proportioned doll in a doll\u2019s house.</p> <p>Over the next little while, Trump will lavish praise on Melania for her crack presidential spouse skills. The first lady, Trump reports over and over during the course of Friday, \u201cworked so hard\u201d on the table settings for the state dinner, pondering every detail. The flowers, the centrepieces, <em>so wonderful</em>, <em>so beautiful</em>. The best table decorations anyone has ever seen.</p> <p>It\u2019s hard for me to imagine the reality of the first lady\u2019s life, what it must be like to agonise over centrepieces for state dinners amid the sound and fury of her husband\u2019s bitterly contested presidency. Given her reserved public presence, it feels like an impertinence to wonder.</p> <p>There\u2019s no time for whimsy in any case, because the Morrisons are now on the premises, ready for their induction into the Trumpiverse. In comparison with the Trumps, Scott and Jenny Morrison, from the Sutherland shire, Australia \u2013 more latterly of Kirribilli House \u2013 look like a well-to-do couple from the suburbs. They are earthed in this big moment, respectful of the tradition they are now associated with, the tradition of Washington\u2019s special friends being drawn to the nation\u2019s bosom.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"1113e2574fe4d70e29acf0ad7a7ad7f39dbf4ca5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1113e2574fe4d70e29acf0ad7a7ad7f39dbf4ca5/574_891_3933_2565/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Scott Morrison\u2019s arrival in Washington marks the second state visit of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"652\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Scott Morrison\u2019s arrival in Washington marks the second state visit of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tasos Katopodis/ABACA POOL/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Presumably they are buzzing with anticipation and anxiety, given that the unofficial White House weather forecast for Friday is clear skies, a light breeze and a high probability of catastrophic cyclone once their delegation reaches the Oval Office. Looking normal in this environment takes some doing, but the Morrisons manage.</p> <p>The troops march, and are duly inspected; the visitors clutch their flags, which flutter gaily in the breeze. The anthems are played. The two couples appear content with each other and the scripted remarks they share with each other and the crowd. Just before the conclusion of the formalities, Austin is back working the fence line to move us, lickety split, to the holding pen outside the Oval Office. Fortunately, the war with Steve seems to have subsided.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"66c9bfcd37dd2f5d9738dbcd357b5696579e9848\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/66c9bfcd37dd2f5d9738dbcd357b5696579e9848/0_0_3500_2334/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trump and Morrison review the troops during an official arrival ceremony.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trump and Morrison review the troops during an official arrival ceremony.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joshua Roberts/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I wash up near Steve and the other White House wire reporters. One of the group explains to me that Steve is the man if they want to get a question to the president. Trump will answer Steve. It\u2019s unclear why that\u2019s the case, and I don\u2019t ask.</p> <p>She also gives us tremendously helpful advice: Trump will be on for a rave when we get in there. We are surprised by this. Our assumption was we\u2019d be in and out in a matter of minutes. Our river guide shakes her head. Trump, she says, is in an expansive frame of mind. Best we prepare some questions. She also predicts that Trump will struggle to understand our accents. If he doesn\u2019t understand, the president will say: \u201cSay it.\u201d This means ask the question again, she says.</p> <p>I assume this is some sort of weird in-joke until I hear Trump do just that. \u201cSay it,\u201d Trump says, narrowing his eyes and curling his lip. It\u2019s utterly peculiar, but it\u2019s an earworm. Once you hear it, it\u2019s hard to get the locution out of your brain. <em>Say it.</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b37ffef0d4889547d0607943359824e51d05d1a4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b37ffef0d4889547d0607943359824e51d05d1a4/517_406_4667_3050/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trump reacts to questions during a joint press conference with Morrison.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"654\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trump reacts to questions during a joint press conference with Morrison.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sipa USA/SIPA USA/PA Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The door of the Oval Office swings open and we are thrust into pure madness. The media scrum feeds off the static electricity in the room. It heaves like a wave. Our questions crash on the shore. Thud, thud, thud. <em>Mr President</em>. The Americans in the pool want to know about Joe Biden and the Ukraine controversy \u2013 a story that will spiral towards impeachment during the week of our visit.</p> <p>No American journalist gives a crap about Australia, and Morrison, and the second state visit to Washington of this febrile presidency. Fun fact: Emmanuel Macron, back when he imagined he had a talent for Trump whispering, was the first to be afforded the honour. But who cares? Conventions are devalued in the coarseness of politics in 2019. No one pretends to care. Everyone just has to emerge with what they need.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fd2a1a7fef45d0c7f683522347c7017d86f6d2a0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd2a1a7fef45d0c7f683522347c7017d86f6d2a0/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Journalists crowd around Morrison and Trump during their press conference.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Journalists crowd around Morrison and Trump during their press conference.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Once we realise this is going to be nuts \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/sep/21/scott-morrison-scrambles-to-contain-political-mushroom-cloud-after-trump-raises-nuclear-option-with-iran\">a small blazing blitzkrieg at the seat of American power with no rules of engagement</a> \u2013 Australian reporters also start hurling questions across a range of topics. Trump looks delighted by the disorder. It\u2019s where he thrives. Morrison shifts in his seat.</p> <p>The president lays into the media. We are hopeless, finished, friendless. But Mr President, what about the call? Did you speak to Ukraine\u2019s new president? <em>It was a beautiful call</em>. Next question. <em>Say it</em>.</p> <p>The Morrisons sit tight as the stiff westerly blows. The prime minister isn\u2019t visibly alarmed but he\u2019s hyper alert. Jenny Morrison composes her face into a placid mask \u2013 until Trump suddenly raises the spectre of nuclear weapons and Iran. I catch her eye at that moment and she startles, ever so slightly. Her eyes, to me, say \u201chelp me\u201d. I catch Morrison\u2019s eye a couple of times and the corners of his mouth crinkle.</p> <p>I am a spectator at this circus but the prime minister isn\u2019t permitted the luxury of distancing. Morrison is a peer of the president, a leader of a respectable middle power who has chosen, as the New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd puts it with just the right squeeze of lemon during our visit, \u201cto play ball with the Mad King\u201d \u2013 to give friendless Donald a friend.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8f90278c71b418d042edd0e2ee6ac8d67c6fa254\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8f90278c71b418d042edd0e2ee6ac8d67c6fa254/0_0_6072_4146/1000.jpg\" alt=\"'It was a beautiful call.'

But back in the nosebleed seats we lack those insights. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/sep/21/scott-morrison-scrambles-to-contain-political-mushroom-cloud-after-trump-raises-nuclear-option-with-iran\">During our 33 minutes in the Oval Office</a>, Australian journalists are on a rollercoaster, hanging upside down, while the president indulges a dialogue with himself about whether to launch a military strike against Iran, or whether restraint is the better course. He lands eventually at restraint but the disorientation is so profound it takes me a while to process that\u2019s where we\u2019ve landed.</p> <p>Eventually Trump stops feeling all the feelings and we are herded out. I ask one of my fellow travelling reporters whether the president just raised the prospect of nuclear attack, because I fear the sleep deprivation might be messing with my cognition. He\u2019s as knocked around as I am. Yes, he thinks so, but he needs to listen to the recording. TV reporters are wondering out loud how on earth they are going to distil what just happened into a package. How do you do this in a minute and a half?</p> <p>At the height of my disorientation, I spot Paul Murray from Sky\u2019s Fox News lite after-dark crew at the back of the room. As we are guided out, Morrison beckons Murray forward and introduces him to the president. This introduction yields an exclusive interview with Trump which includes the simpering question: \u201cWhat do you want to say to your many Australian supporters who wish you nothing but the best in November 2020?\u201d I suppose it could have been what was his favourite colour.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MayneReport/status/1175172465498062848\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Paul Murray gets his exclusive with \u2066<a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@realDonaldTrump</a>\u2069 but talk about not asking the hard questions. <a href=\"https://t.co/5QnxMW5cHh\">pic.twitter.com/5QnxMW5cHh</a></p>&mdash; Stephen Mayne (@MayneReport) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MayneReport/status/1175172465498062848?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 20, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>The madness persists. The day ends with wranglers trying to facilitate some access to the state dinner, which is al fresco, in the Rose Garden. As we are herded through the South Lawn accompanied by the lilt of violins serenading guests and the murmur of clinking glassware and small talk, a secret service guy in night goggles, with foliage in his helmet, suddenly materialises from the bushes and sprints across in front of us.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"773083db8f938717cacbe50c3db668e477029fad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/773083db8f938717cacbe50c3db668e477029fad/0_0_3000_1996/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mr. and Mrs. Trump meet with Mr. and Mrs. Morrison as they attend a state dinner.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mr. and Mrs. Trump meet with Mr. and Mrs. Morrison as they attend a state dinner.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pool/ABACA/PA Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Shortly after this our White House wrangler declares this walk off the record, which generates considerable confusion among the scribes. How can a walk to a pool position be off the record? Which bit is off the record? This walk never happened? How do we explain our capacity to bear witness to events at the state dinner? Did we parachute in?</p> <p>We resolve not to overthink this and press on, and eventually get close enough to see the guests drifting around the Rose Garden: the Australian billionaire box maker Anthony Pratt is hard to miss with his shock of orange hair; the younger Murdochs are there, Lachlan and Sarah, I reckon I\u2019ve spotted the mining magnates Twiggy Forrest and the generally reclusive Gina Rinehart, who appears to be floating. I rub my eyes, fearing a fancy. Perhaps Rinehart is not floating, more likely I\u2019m swaying, peering through a large shrub, sleep deprived and smacking the mosquitos that threaten my ankles, questioning my life choices.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e1cbaaa3d3164204158ef1a726d2b8ce727260b9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e1cbaaa3d3164204158ef1a726d2b8ce727260b9/0_0_3000_2115/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fox CEO and co-chairman of News Corp Lachlan Murdoch (L) and Sarah Murdoch arrive for the state dinner.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"705\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fox CEO and co-chairman of News Corp Lachlan Murdoch (L) and Sarah Murdoch arrive for the state dinner.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ron Sachs/POOL/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"db100981edf8187f18649dc9f7bc5d5ba3de4138\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/db100981edf8187f18649dc9f7bc5d5ba3de4138/0_0_2221_3000/740.jpg\" alt=\"Hancock Prospecting chairwoman Georgina Rinehart arrives for the state dinner.\" width=\"740\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hancock Prospecting chairwoman Georgina Rinehart arrives for the state dinner.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ron Sachs/POOL/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I see Rinehart again the next day, floating (she is definitely wafting like a cloud, because I know I\u2019m no longer swaying) into a soiree at the Australian ambassador Joe Hockey\u2019s residence, in a white dress with sequins and what appear to be pom poms trailing at the back. Morrison\u2019s old chief of staff and new department head, Phil Gaetjens, by contrast, is wandering around in a Wallabies rugby jersey with cut-off sleeves.</p> <p>While the grandees mingle, Rinehart sets up court with her entourage in a shaded corner of the garden on what looks like a sedan chair, but is actually just a garden settee. The visual cue is Ms Rinehart is receiving guests, as long as they are not journalists. The media mogul Kerry Stokes is also said to be mingling but I don\u2019t clap eyes on him.</p> <p>In Hockey\u2019s garden I strike up a conversation with an expatriate pub owner who is now the mayor of Annapolis and is campaigning to tighten gun control. Gavin Buckley, formerly from Western Australia, is an avuncular Democrat at a Republican knees-up, a fish out of water who can\u2019t quite believe his luck. Buckley tells me he hugged Hockey for the great honour bestowed upon him.</p> <p>The whole scene is F Scott Fitzgerald meets the pre-woke capitalism of the 1980s, and the humidity is sending us all bonkers. Servers hand out party pies and sausages with disturbing names like cheese and Vegemite, and bald men in linen sports jackets compete for shade. One of our travelling media pack then proceeds to conduct a mock interview of a new magnolia tree which has just been planted to celebrate the Morrison state visit. <em>With the Magnolia, this is Brett Mason, SBS News.</em> It\u2019s a joke, hijinks to help us stay alert when we are hitting that hour of the day when jetlag threatens to take your legs out. But we\u2019ve crossed the sense barrier and we haven\u2019t even hit the Trump rally. What could possibly go wrong?</p> <h2><strong>Ohio</strong></h2> <p>It\u2019s a voyage with billionaires, this American excursion with Morrison. I confess that this is new territory for me. The cashed-up and politically connected drifted past us during the pomp and circumstance in Washington, and now we are closing in on Anthony Pratt as we speed to Wapakoneta, first airborne and then jammed in Morrison\u2019s motorcade with police cars racing past, sirens blaring, to stop traffic on the freeway.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"4af9fcda31280f76760f4042fd106e78ba7b9268\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4af9fcda31280f76760f4042fd106e78ba7b9268/0_186_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Crowds await the opening of Pratt Paper Plant in Wapakoneta, Ohio.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Crowds await the opening of Pratt Paper Plant in Wapakoneta, Ohio.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mick Tsikas/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Morrison, who will be thriving on all this hard work and energised by the thought that he might be called upon to pull things back from the brink, is upbeat during a quick amble down the back of the plane. He wonders what we have made of the Oval Office. \u201cTwo words,\u201d I shoot back. \u201cHow good?\u201d</p> <p>The gaggle of Morrison staff tumbling in and out of black vans in the motorcades, and standing glassy eyed at midnight in hotel foyers, clutching their phones and wondering what day it is, look in reasonable shape despite the fact that most of them won\u2019t have slept much. Team Morrison and senior bureaucrats drift in and out of our orbit, leaving us mostly in the hands of a crack team of departmental minders. These officials, particularly the logistics people, are always the unsung heroes of these trips. The wranglers on this trip are outstanding. The pace is punishing \u2013 at times it feels like early in the Kevin Rudd era. The transitions are down to the second and there are no screw-ups, at least none that are visible to us.</p> <p>One of Morrison\u2019s press secretaries, Nick Creevey, has joined us for the sprint to Wapakoneta on the commandeered Dayton school bus. We\u2019re all practising the pronunciation of Wapakoneta. Wah-pa, Christ, how do you spell this bloody place again? Katina Curtis, the meticulously prepared Australian Associated Press reporter, is patient with the spelling drills. <em>Hey Katina. How do you spell \u2026</em></p> <p>There are few female journalists on this trip, and overseas voyages, in my experience, tend to take on an Aussie barbecue dimension. This is a generalisation but, as generalisations go, not an unfair one. Male correspondents largely herd together, socialise together, crack jokes together, reinforce one another\u2019s insights, and women run on a parallel track. It\u2019s a strange dynamic at times; stranger because the blokes who engage in the behaviour would be entirely unconscious that\u2019s what\u2019s happening. It\u2019s just custom, or muscle memory. Hashtag road trip. Hashtag dudes.</p> <p>Dayton to Wapakoneta is flat and rural. The billboards we pass are a combination of fast food temptations and Jesus Christ, saving the born and unborn. I\u2019m both fascinated to learn what we are driving into and mildly apprehensive, given that Trump rallies can be hostile to the media covering them, and hackles in the base must be raised by the latest mainstream media pursuit over Trump and Ukraine. The president loves a persecution narrative with him at the centre of it \u2013 it fuels the righteous rage of his supporters. Everyone can be aggrieved together.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fd37d480155a8e9c28b6b0768144252ff28c7063\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd37d480155a8e9c28b6b0768144252ff28c7063/0_0_4493_3061/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trump supporters await the arrival of their hero.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"681\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trump supporters await the arrival of their hero in Wapakoneta.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mick Tsikas/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nobody in the PM\u2019s entourage expresses any apprehension at all about Ohio, not even a hint of it. But my instinct suggests they are also worried about the unknown. There are risks in the look of this thing. Should Morrison really be at a Trump rally (even though the Ohio event is more complicated than a 2020 campaign whistle stop with Morrison attached). Apart from the possibility of any bizarre, indefensible off-piste business, there is also the risk of Trump banging on and on and on. It is entirely possible scheduled remarks at the opening of a box factory could stretch into a Castroesque monologue that kills our logistics stone dead. Morrison\u2019s crew had expected the Oval Office encounter to last for a few minutes and instead it stretched, putting them behind for the remainder of the day.</p> <p>I filed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/sep/23/morrison-visits-an-australian-box-factory-in-ohio-and-the-trump-crowd-goes-wild\">a column describing our arrival into Wapakoneta</a> and the rapturous welcome the locals gave Trump, but there were some other memorable moments behind the scenes. When Trump and his entourage finally blow in to town in a blaze of police sirens and secret service agents, we are reunited with the same White House press pool we met on Friday outside the Oval, grinding through another event. I clock Steve in the distance, kicking on.</p> <p>Trump engages Pratt the minute he\u2019s in the factory. The two billionaires exchange lavish compliments as they amble towards the gaggle of reporters. Presumably the box maker is explaining recycling to Trump as they go. Rubbish in, box out, cash in.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"e43a8738e782e0254c197c6e90eec1ee0317df55\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e43a8738e782e0254c197c6e90eec1ee0317df55/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trump (L) and Morrison (R) with the chairman of Pratt Industries, Anthony Prat.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trump and Morrison with the chairman of Pratt Industries, Anthony Prat.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Ernst/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The president then tracks towards where the journalists are corralled behind the fence, straining to get an iPhone snap for Twitter. He\u2019s looking for Steve, the Trump whisperer, because he\u2019s got exciting information to share. \u201cSo that\u2019s 100% recycled paper into a really, fine finished product,\u201d the president enthuses on the fence line. \u201cIt\u2019s really amazing, Steve. They start off with \u2026\u201d Trump pauses delicately \u2026 \u201ccan I use the word \u2018garbage\u2019?\u201d</p> <p>Pratt is entirely comfortable with the word. Pratt Industries, Ohio, is proudly euphemism-free. Trump picks up the story: \u201cThey start off with waste, garbage, and they end up building it into a \u2013 making it into really great cardboard and paper.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA hundred per cent of the plant\u201d. As I mentioned earlier, I\u2019ve never seen Steve before these couple of brief encounters, he is a complete stranger to me, and what follows is pure speculation, but I\u2019m going to hazard a guess that he knows what recycling is. I reckon Steve does know about it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"32a721ce56b3aec807b14971831b2fc95a2c7fbe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/32a721ce56b3aec807b14971831b2fc95a2c7fbe/353_0_3767_2648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In the last presidential contest, Anthony Pratt bet $100,000 on Trump to win against Hillary Clinton.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"703\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In the last presidential contest, Anthony Pratt bet $100,000 on Trump to win against Hillary Clinton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Trump is another story. Possibly this impromptu recycling-for-dummies tutorial is just the president being performatively didactic, or perhaps he is inoculating himself from cable TV hysterics who might associate reuse with One World Government. Or perhaps this is the first time in his life he\u2019s encountered recycling.</p> <p>Trump continues to roll this newfangled Pratt magic around in his mind, and engage journalists enthusiastically along the fence line. \u201cThat\u2019s really some equipment. The finest equipment in the world. And more and more people are going this way.</p> <p>\u201cNormally, you take down trees and you make the paper. In this case, Anthony does 90, 95% out of waste, out of garbage, and they make incredible final product through a very \u2013 through really a very \u2013 a really costly but efficient process.\u201d He could be describing the interface between tycoons and politicians but let\u2019s not be caustic or labour the metaphor. We need to continue with our story.</p> <p>Emboldened by this level of engagement from the president, one of the Australian journalists calls out: \u201cDo you want more businessmen like Mr Pratt, Mr President?\u201d. Trump is confused. <em>Say it.</em> (Implied, not stated: louder visiting freak, take two.) <em>Say it.</em></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/sep/24/scott-morrison-praises-donald-trumps-political-priorities\">Scott Morrison praises Donald Trump's political priorities</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cDo you want more businessmen like Mr Pratt to invest in America like he has?\u201d Trump narrows his eyes. \u201cYeah, well, we have some good ones.

He tells the Australian newspaper Trump is going to win in the 2020 election. Lest this just appear guesswork, or another shovel load of obsequiousness, history shows that Pratt has a sharp eye. In the last presidential contest the billionaire box maker bet $100,000 on Trump to win against Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>Asked whether he\u2019d make the same bet again, Pratt reports that he\u2019s raised the stakes. There is now $2bn on the table \u2013 investments in new paper operations in the US. \u201cI told the president we want to continue to invest and fulfil our pledge,\u201d Pratt tells the paper. \u201cIt was very gracious of him to come to our Ohio plant opening.

As another wealthy entrepreneur, Malcolm Turnbull, was once fond of saying. What. A. Time. To. Be. Alive.</p> <h2><strong>New York</strong></h2> <p>By the time we roll out of Chicago \u2013 a whistle stop characterised by a serious foreign policy pivot from Morrison, and an unfortunate photo opportunity in front of a McDonald\u2019s smart board that built a visual bridge to Engadine for people familiar with the infamous internet meme (let\u2019s just leave it at that) \u2013 and on to New York, the drumbeat is cacophonous, literally and figuratively.</p> <p>It is leader\u2019s week at the UN general assembly, and the area around the headquarters is locked down. The streets teem with protesters and delegates, and groups of Africans gather on Forty-fourth Street to drum and sing. The UNgeneral assembly circus drives New Yorkers bonkers, the streets are gridlocked and the eateries overflow, but the vibrancy of it is quite wonderful: the convivial murmur of languages on the east side of Midtown, the colour and style of the clothing, the downing of late-night whiskey amid animated conversation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"4d8d055dc8cefe682171aced50d1d456de2237e1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d8d055dc8cefe682171aced50d1d456de2237e1/0_0_5568_3712/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Morrison delivers his statement to the 74th session of the UN general assembly.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Morrison delivers his statement to the 74th session of the UN general assembly.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mick Tsikas/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Trump declares theatrically, with Nancy Pelosi closing in, during his address to the UN national assembly, that this is the time for patriots, not globalists. It\u2019s a soundbite crafted for Breitbart or Fox News, potent with his rusted-ons, but a hollow slogan in the world of facts and evidence. Did I miss the bit of history where globalisation became optional? For what it\u2019s worth, New York categorically ignores him. On the streets, in the stores, in the financial district, globalisation prevails. It\u2019s not even a contest.</p> <p>Beyond the literal, the figurative drumbeat is for Trump. Impeachment is closing in on the president. Some commentators say he looked subdued at the UN, which would be a rare lapse in self-confidence. The mood at the start of the week in Washington was come and get me suckers. But I\u2019m out of the presidential orbit now so I have no first-hand observation to report.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bb80383e5a4308a2d593e622eff6b82a9b61e133\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bb80383e5a4308a2d593e622eff6b82a9b61e133/0_0_3540_2360/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trump waits to give his address.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trump waits to give his address.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mick Tsikas/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Morrison, comprehensively overshadowed by movements in the tectonic plates of the major powers, ploughs on diligently with his UN program and seems unperturbed by the misfortune of his two mates, Boris Johnson and Trump, hitting some serious turbulence. If the prime minister had any regrets about taking hospitality from Trump and aligning Australia\u2019s diplomatic language precisely with the president on some thorny geopolitical issues, he certainly didn\u2019t show it.</p> <p>A certain defensiveness did creep in on climate change, though. Morrison wasn\u2019t cranky but there were persistent pesky questions from the travelling media about Australia\u2019s lack of policy ambition, and about his decision not to attend the UN climate summit on Monday. Even Trump called by. Why didn\u2019t Morrison? There was the sound of prime ministerial teeth being gritted.</p> <p>Interestingly, Morrison\u2019s speech to the UN general assembly, which was billed initially as being an address about practical environmentalism, not climate change, drifted back into climate. There was a significant chunk defending his government\u2019s policies, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/sep/26/scott-morrison-says-australias-record-on-climate-change-misrepresented-by-media\">some umbrage at the media for feeding false narratives</a> \u2013 not fake news, mind you, but stoking prejudicial sentiment.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9d52b88f513e90c1ae422cef22c2a0f343f8b53b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9d52b88f513e90c1ae422cef22c2a0f343f8b53b/0_0_2705_1617/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Morrison defends his government\u2019s record on climate change to the UN general assembly.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"598\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Morrison defends his government\u2019s record on climate change to the UN general assembly.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lucas Jackson/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In New York we meet our final billionaire, Mike Cannon-Brookes. The final piece of my triptych, the next gen mover and shaker, moves in different circles to Pratt and Rinehart. MCB didn\u2019t make the cut for the state dinner at the White House, evidently, but he made a bit of a splash at the UN.</p> <p>The Atlassian founder went to the climate summit <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/23/atlassian-billionaire-to-announce-net-zero-emissions-target-at-un-climate-summit\">to commit his company to a target of net zero emissions</a> by no later than 2050. Cannon-Brookes nudged Morrison on Twitter: \u201cPlease give us a future we can believe in tomorrow. Inspire us. Lead us. Don\u2019t bullshit us. I\u2019m happy to help, as are millions of Aussies.\u201d</p> <p>I meet Cannon-Brookes at the Flower Shop, a hipster bar on the Lower East Side. His minders invited us down for a beverage. Most of my colleagues are punctual but I\u2019m late, because the traffic is terrible, and the bearded tech entrepreneur lobs late as well. There is an overwhelming smell of weed that eddies through the bar as we settle in, which I stress is not connected to anyone in our group or Atlassian\u2019s.</p> <p>I don\u2019t know who is responsible for this licentiousness and don\u2019t intend to investigate, frankly \u2013 but it\u2019s surreal, meeting a thirty-something billionaire in a bar as the bookend of this bonkers week, and having the bar reek of marijuana \u2013 that I find it hard to stop laughing at the unlikeliness of it all. It caps off the Through the Looking Glass sensation of the US odyssey.</p> <p>The evening is convivial and, unsurprisingly, there is much impassioned talk about climate change and energy policy and a fair sprinkling of acronyms \u2013 a bunch of Aussies jousting good naturedly about the future of the planet in a bar in Manhattan. I leave Cannon-Brookes downstairs shooting pool with a few stayers, settling in to welcome the dawn, and head uptown, clearing my head by walking up Forty-fifth Street as the dumpster trucks and the street sweepers move into high gear for the pre-dawn cleanse.</p> <p>I engage a cop at a checkpoint just to make sure I haven\u2019t veered wildly off course in a desperate bid for oxygen. \u201cThe Roosevelt is just up here,\u201d I inquire, \u201cright?\u201d The cop smiles and sips his coffee. \u201cI\u2019m from Brooklyn, m\u2019am.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Support our independent journalism with a one-off or recurring <a href=\"https://support.theguardian.com/au/contribute?acquisitionData=%7B%22componentType%22%3A%22ACQUISITIONS_EDITORIAL_LINK%22%2C%22source%22%3A%22GUARDIAN_WEB%22%2C%22campaignCode%22%3A%22AUS_EDITORIAL%22%2C%22componentId%22%3A%22katharine_murphy_trump_tour%22%7D&amp;INTCMP=AUS_EDITORIAL\">contribution</a></em></p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "Scott Morrison has made his first visit to the United States as prime minister. It was a trip that included a close encounter with the unpredictability of the Trump White House, a foreign policy pivot, and a backlash about a lack of climate policy action. Guardian Australia\u2019s political editor, Katharine Murphy, travelled, with the prime minister. Here is what she witnessed: Washington We\u2019ve been positioned at the White House since 5am, watching the sun creep over the American capital. Security is as laborious as you\u2019d expect. Dogs sniff bags, then the secret service guys have a good look, passports are collected, checked and returned, White House passes and pins are distributed, and then at last we clear the metal detectors. Eventually we make it to the press briefing room, the small blue one, famous through several presidential administrations but now abandoned by Donald Trump. The modest proportions don\u2019t fit his presidency. Now it\u2019s just a transit zone. We are greeted by a blond woman in a broad-brimmed hat. June, a self-described southern belle, is receiving visitors in the briefing room, although it\u2019s not clear why. She identifies herself as a fellow scribe working for Christian radio and television in Nashville. When she\u2019s not reporting on the Trump White House, she\u2019s rallying Christians for the president. This seems something of a line cross for a reporter with White House press accreditation \u2013 but we\u2019ve been on the premises for about 10 minutes and it\u2019s clear that we\u2019re not in Kansas any more. On the other side of the building, visitors are streaming across the South Lawn to grab prime positions to witness The Donald receiving The Scott at the official welcome. Flags, American and Australian, are held aloft on a glorious summery day. Eventually we are permitted to wander down to the lawn as well. The Donald\u2019s grass is lush and slightly dewy, making me regret my choice of footwear. The daylight is now dazzling but the bucolic scene is disturbed by Austin rebuking Steve in the media pen. The confrontation happens just before the splendidly peppy pipe band strides across the lawn for the ceremonial welcome. I\u2019ve never met Austin before this moment but he looks about 30, buttoned down and watchful as a raptor \u2013 a White House wrangler who looks as though he hasn\u2019t sat down, eaten anything apart from a protein bar, or slept more than four hours straight a night since early infancy. Steve has transgressed and Austin convenes a short, sharp show trial in front of me. I\u2019ve nabbed a prime position on the fence in the media pen right in front of the entrance, and I don\u2019t intend to move unless the secret service guy standing beside me gets feisty. \u201cYou left the media area to make a call,\u201d Austin says, voice appropriately low so as not to disdain the Wonderful Occasion swelling around us. Steve is older than his accuser and possesses the rumpled look of a longtime print or news wire reporter. I\u2019ve never seen Steve before either, but he\u2019s clearly part of the White House press pool and looks like a man disinclined to small talk. My guess, from my quick scan of the body language, the suppressed inner sigh, is that Steve has seen a number of Austins in his reporting lifetime, perhaps a small production line of them, and is not much gripped by this power play. Steve says nothing. Austin persists. In a minute we are going to go full Veep. \u201cThe secret service told me you left the media area to make a call \u2013 is this correct?\u201d Steve, at the end of his tolerance for J\u2019Accuse now, delivers his mic drop. \u201cYah,\u201d he says. \u201cOne of the secret service guys held back the rope so I could get out to make the call. I needed to take the call.\u201d I suspect Austin doesn\u2019t really know where to take this from here. The aide returns to the front of the fence, shoulders back, eyes front. It\u2019s showtime. Trump strides out of the White House with Melania. From my vantage point they look like a pair of Easter Island statues. This is my first encounter with the current leader of the free world and my curiosity is intense. How will Trump look uncut? Will he look how he does on television, with that weird affect \u2013 the pursed lips, narrowed eyes and nose and chin set to an upward inflection, indicative of defiance and displeasure? Or is this a posture he adopts only after he pulls on the presidential onesie every day and heads for Fox News, purring \u201cready for my close-up Mr DeMille\u201d? I discover this is how Trump looks all the time, or at least all the time he is in open space. He\u2019s striding to the podium with exactly that look, with Melania, who is a dignified presence yet strangely devoid of life force. Perhaps she laughs and sings and dances in her track pants like no one is watching in her private domain but, in public, Mrs Trump looks like a perfectly proportioned doll in a doll\u2019s house. Over the next little while, Trump will lavish praise on Melania for her crack presidential spouse skills. The first lady, Trump reports over and over during the course of Friday, \u201cworked so hard\u201d on the table settings for the state dinner, pondering every detail. The flowers, the centrepieces, so wonderful, so beautiful. The best table decorations anyone has ever seen. It\u2019s hard for me to imagine the reality of the first lady\u2019s life, what it must be like to agonise over centrepieces for state dinners amid the sound and fury of her husband\u2019s bitterly contested presidency. Given her reserved public presence, it feels like an impertinence to wonder. There\u2019s no time for whimsy in any case, because the Morrisons are now on the premises, ready for their induction into the Trumpiverse. In comparison with the Trumps, Scott and Jenny Morrison, from the Sutherland shire, Australia \u2013 more latterly of Kirribilli House \u2013 look like a well-to-do couple from the suburbs. They are earthed in this big moment, respectful of the tradition they are now associated with, the tradition of Washington\u2019s special friends being drawn to the nation\u2019s bosom. Presumably they are buzzing with anticipation and anxiety, given that the unofficial White House weather forecast for Friday is clear skies, a light breeze and a high probability of catastrophic cyclone once their delegation reaches the Oval Office. Looking normal in this environment takes some doing, but the Morrisons manage. The troops march, and are duly inspected; the visitors clutch their flags, which flutter gaily in the breeze. The anthems are played. The two couples appear content with each other and the scripted remarks they share with each other and the crowd. Just before the conclusion of the formalities, Austin is back working the fence line to move us, lickety split, to the holding pen outside the Oval Office. Fortunately, the war with Steve seems to have subsided. I wash up near Steve and the other White House wire reporters. One of the group explains to me that Steve is the man if they want to get a question to the president. Trump will answer Steve. It\u2019s unclear why that\u2019s the case, and I don\u2019t ask. She also gives us tremendously helpful advice: Trump will be on for a rave when we get in there. We are surprised by this. Our assumption was we\u2019d be in and out in a matter of minutes. Our river guide shakes her head. Trump, she says, is in an expansive frame of mind. Best we prepare some questions. She also predicts that Trump will struggle to understand our accents. If he doesn\u2019t understand, the president will say: \u201cSay it.\u201d This means ask the question again, she says. I assume this is some sort of weird in-joke until I hear Trump do just that. \u201cSay it,\u201d Trump says, narrowing his eyes and curling his lip. It\u2019s utterly peculiar, but it\u2019s an earworm. Once you hear it, it\u2019s hard to get the locution out of your brain. Say it. The door of the Oval Office swings open and we are thrust into pure madness. The media scrum feeds off the static electricity in the room. It heaves like a wave. Our questions crash on the shore. Thud, thud, thud. Mr President. The Americans in the pool want to know about Joe Biden and the Ukraine controversy \u2013 a story that will spiral towards impeachment during the week of our visit. No American journalist gives a crap about Australia, and Morrison, and the second state visit to Washington of this febrile presidency. Fun fact: Emmanuel Macron, back when he imagined he had a talent for Trump whispering, was the first to be afforded the honour. But who cares? Conventions are devalued in the coarseness of politics in 2019. No one pretends to care. Everyone just has to emerge with what they need. Once we realise this is going to be nuts \u2013 a small blazing blitzkrieg at the seat of American power with no rules of engagement \u2013 Australian reporters also start hurling questions across a range of topics. Trump looks delighted by the disorder. It\u2019s where he thrives. Morrison shifts in his seat. The president lays into the media. We are hopeless, finished, friendless. But Mr President, what about the call? Did you speak to Ukraine\u2019s new president? It was a beautiful call. Next question. Say it. The Morrisons sit tight as the stiff westerly blows. The prime minister isn\u2019t visibly alarmed but he\u2019s hyper alert. Jenny Morrison composes her face into a placid mask \u2013 until Trump suddenly raises the spectre of nuclear weapons and Iran. I catch her eye at that moment and she startles, ever so slightly. Her eyes, to me, say \u201chelp me\u201d. I catch Morrison\u2019s eye a couple of times and the corners of his mouth crinkle. I am a spectator at this circus but the prime minister isn\u2019t permitted the luxury of distancing. Morrison is a peer of the president, a leader of a respectable middle power who has chosen, as the New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd puts it with just the right squeeze of lemon during our visit, \u201cto play ball with the Mad King\u201d \u2013 to give friendless Donald a friend. The prime minister, unlike us, enjoys the benefit of knowing what Trump really thinks on a range of fronts; he has that baseline to keep him tethered through the rhetorical turbulence. But back in the nosebleed seats we lack those insights. During our 33 minutes in the Oval Office, Australian journalists are on a rollercoaster, hanging upside down, while the president indulges a dialogue with himself about whether to launch a military strike against Iran, or whether restraint is the better course. He lands eventually at restraint but the disorientation is so profound it takes me a while to process that\u2019s where we\u2019ve landed. Eventually Trump stops feeling all the feelings and we are herded out. I ask one of my fellow travelling reporters whether the president just raised the prospect of nuclear attack, because I fear the sleep deprivation might be messing with my cognition. He\u2019s as knocked around as I am. Yes, he thinks so, but he needs to listen to the recording. TV reporters are wondering out loud how on earth they are going to distil what just happened into a package. How do you do this in a minute and a half? At the height of my disorientation, I spot Paul Murray from Sky\u2019s Fox News lite after-dark crew at the back of the room. As we are guided out, Morrison beckons Murray forward and introduces him to the president. This introduction yields an exclusive interview with Trump which includes the simpering question: \u201cWhat do you want to say to your many Australian supporters who wish you nothing but the best in November 2020?\u201d I suppose it could have been what was his favourite colour. The madness persists. The day ends with wranglers trying to facilitate some access to the state dinner, which is al fresco, in the Rose Garden. As we are herded through the South Lawn accompanied by the lilt of violins serenading guests and the murmur of clinking glassware and small talk, a secret service guy in night goggles, with foliage in his helmet, suddenly materialises from the bushes and sprints across in front of us. Shortly after this our White House wrangler declares this walk off the record, which generates considerable confusion among the scribes. How can a walk to a pool position be off the record? Which bit is off the record? This walk never happened? How do we explain our capacity to bear witness to events at the state dinner? Did we parachute in? We resolve not to overthink this and press on, and eventually get close enough to see the guests drifting around the Rose Garden: the Australian billionaire box maker Anthony Pratt is hard to miss with his shock of orange hair; the younger Murdochs are there, Lachlan and Sarah, I reckon I\u2019ve spotted the mining magnates Twiggy Forrest and the generally reclusive Gina Rinehart, who appears to be floating. I rub my eyes, fearing a fancy. Perhaps Rinehart is not floating, more likely I\u2019m swaying, peering through a large shrub, sleep deprived and smacking the mosquitos that threaten my ankles, questioning my life choices. I see Rinehart again the next day, floating (she is definitely wafting like a cloud, because I know I\u2019m no longer swaying) into a soiree at the Australian ambassador Joe Hockey\u2019s residence, in a white dress with sequins and what appear to be pom poms trailing at the back. Morrison\u2019s old chief of staff and new department head, Phil Gaetjens, by contrast, is wandering around in a Wallabies rugby jersey with cut-off sleeves. While the grandees mingle, Rinehart sets up court with her entourage in a shaded corner of the garden on what looks like a sedan chair, but is actually just a garden settee. The visual cue is Ms Rinehart is receiving guests, as long as they are not journalists. The media mogul Kerry Stokes is also said to be mingling but I don\u2019t clap eyes on him. In Hockey\u2019s garden I strike up a conversation with an expatriate pub owner who is now the mayor of Annapolis and is campaigning to tighten gun control. Gavin Buckley, formerly from Western Australia, is an avuncular Democrat at a Republican knees-up, a fish out of water who can\u2019t quite believe his luck. Buckley tells me he hugged Hockey for the great honour bestowed upon him. The whole scene is F Scott Fitzgerald meets the pre-woke capitalism of the 1980s, and the humidity is sending us all bonkers. Servers hand out party pies and sausages with disturbing names like cheese and Vegemite, and bald men in linen sports jackets compete for shade. One of our travelling media pack then proceeds to conduct a mock interview of a new magnolia tree which has just been planted to celebrate the Morrison state visit. With the Magnolia, this is Brett Mason, SBS News. It\u2019s a joke, hijinks to help us stay alert when we are hitting that hour of the day when jetlag threatens to take your legs out. But we\u2019ve crossed the sense barrier and we haven\u2019t even hit the Trump rally. What could possibly go wrong? Ohio It\u2019s a voyage with billionaires, this American excursion with Morrison. I confess that this is new territory for me. The cashed-up and politically connected drifted past us during the pomp and circumstance in Washington, and now we are closing in on Anthony Pratt as we speed to Wapakoneta, first airborne and then jammed in Morrison\u2019s motorcade with police cars racing past, sirens blaring, to stop traffic on the freeway. Morrison, who will be thriving on all this hard work and energised by the thought that he might be called upon to pull things back from the brink, is upbeat during a quick amble down the back of the plane. He wonders what we have made of the Oval Office. \u201cTwo words,\u201d I shoot back. \u201cHow good?\u201d The gaggle of Morrison staff tumbling in and out of black vans in the motorcades, and standing glassy eyed at midnight in hotel foyers, clutching their phones and wondering what day it is, look in reasonable shape despite the fact that most of them won\u2019t have slept much. Team Morrison and senior bureaucrats drift in and out of our orbit, leaving us mostly in the hands of a crack team of departmental minders. These officials, particularly the logistics people, are always the unsung heroes of these trips. The wranglers on this trip are outstanding. The pace is punishing \u2013 at times it feels like early in the Kevin Rudd era. The transitions are down to the second and there are no screw-ups, at least none that are visible to us. One of Morrison\u2019s press secretaries, Nick Creevey, has joined us for the sprint to Wapakoneta on the commandeered Dayton school bus. We\u2019re all practising the pronunciation of Wapakoneta. Wah-pa, Christ, how do you spell this bloody place again? Katina Curtis, the meticulously prepared Australian Associated Press reporter, is patient with the spelling drills. Hey Katina. How do you spell \u2026 There are few female journalists on this trip, and overseas voyages, in my experience, tend to take on an Aussie barbecue dimension. This is a generalisation but, as generalisations go, not an unfair one. Male correspondents largely herd together, socialise together, crack jokes together, reinforce one another\u2019s insights, and women run on a parallel track. It\u2019s a strange dynamic at times; stranger because the blokes who engage in the behaviour would be entirely unconscious that\u2019s what\u2019s happening. It\u2019s just custom, or muscle memory. Hashtag road trip. Hashtag dudes. Dayton to Wapakoneta is flat and rural. The billboards we pass are a combination of fast food temptations and Jesus Christ, saving the born and unborn. I\u2019m both fascinated to learn what we are driving into and mildly apprehensive, given that Trump rallies can be hostile to the media covering them, and hackles in the base must be raised by the latest mainstream media pursuit over Trump and Ukraine. The president loves a persecution narrative with him at the centre of it \u2013 it fuels the righteous rage of his supporters. Everyone can be aggrieved together. Nobody in the PM\u2019s entourage expresses any apprehension at all about Ohio, not even a hint of it. But my instinct suggests they are also worried about the unknown. There are risks in the look of this thing. Should Morrison really be at a Trump rally (even though the Ohio event is more complicated than a 2020 campaign whistle stop with Morrison attached). Apart from the possibility of any bizarre, indefensible off-piste business, there is also the risk of Trump banging on and on and on. It is entirely possible scheduled remarks at the opening of a box factory could stretch into a Castroesque monologue that kills our logistics stone dead. Morrison\u2019s crew had expected the Oval Office encounter to last for a few minutes and instead it stretched, putting them behind for the remainder of the day. I filed a column describing our arrival into Wapakoneta and the rapturous welcome the locals gave Trump, but there were some other memorable moments behind the scenes. When Trump and his entourage finally blow in to town in a blaze of police sirens and secret service agents, we are reunited with the same White House press pool we met on Friday outside the Oval, grinding through another event. I clock Steve in the distance, kicking on. Trump engages Pratt the minute he\u2019s in the factory. The two billionaires exchange lavish compliments as they amble towards the gaggle of reporters. Presumably the box maker is explaining recycling to Trump as they go. Rubbish in, box out, cash in. The president then tracks towards where the journalists are corralled behind the fence, straining to get an iPhone snap for Twitter. He\u2019s looking for Steve, the Trump whisperer, because he\u2019s got exciting information to share. \u201cSo that\u2019s 100% recycled paper into a really, fine finished product,\u201d the president enthuses on the fence line. \u201cIt\u2019s really amazing, Steve. They start off with \u2026\u201d Trump pauses delicately \u2026 \u201ccan I use the word \u2018garbage\u2019?\u201d Pratt is entirely comfortable with the word. Pratt Industries, Ohio, is proudly euphemism-free. Trump picks up the story: \u201cThey start off with waste, garbage, and they end up building it into a \u2013 making it into really great cardboard and paper.\u201d \u201cA hundred per cent of the plant\u201d. As I mentioned earlier, I\u2019ve never seen Steve before these couple of brief encounters, he is a complete stranger to me, and what follows is pure speculation, but I\u2019m going to hazard a guess that he knows what recycling is. I reckon Steve does know about it. Trump is another story. Possibly this impromptu recycling-for-dummies tutorial is just the president being performatively didactic, or perhaps he is inoculating himself from cable TV hysterics who might associate reuse with One World Government. Or perhaps this is the first time in his life he\u2019s encountered recycling. Trump continues to roll this newfangled Pratt magic around in his mind, and engage journalists enthusiastically along the fence line. \u201cThat\u2019s really some equipment. The finest equipment in the world. And more and more people are going this way. \u201cNormally, you take down trees and you make the paper. In this case, Anthony does 90, 95% out of waste, out of garbage, and they make incredible final product through a very \u2013 through really a very \u2013 a really costly but efficient process.\u201d He could be describing the interface between tycoons and politicians but let\u2019s not be caustic or labour the metaphor. We need to continue with our story. Emboldened by this level of engagement from the president, one of the Australian journalists calls out: \u201cDo you want more businessmen like Mr Pratt, Mr President?\u201d. Trump is confused. Say it. (Implied, not stated: louder visiting freak, take two.) Say it. \u201cDo you want more businessmen like Mr Pratt to invest in America like he has?\u201d Trump narrows his eyes. \u201cYeah, well, we have some good ones. But this man is number one in Australia, they say.\u201d Number one of course, being the highest Trump accolade. That and apex predator. Pratt returns the favour before we leave America. He tells the Australian newspaper Trump is going to win in the 2020 election. Lest this just appear guesswork, or another shovel load of obsequiousness, history shows that Pratt has a sharp eye. In the last presidential contest the billionaire box maker bet $100,000 on Trump to win against Hillary Clinton. Asked whether he\u2019d make the same bet again, Pratt reports that he\u2019s raised the stakes. There is now $2bn on the table \u2013 investments in new paper operations in the US. \u201cI told the president we want to continue to invest and fulfil our pledge,\u201d Pratt tells the paper. \u201cIt was very gracious of him to come to our Ohio plant opening. I was fortunate to spend some time with him. He was as gracious as ever.\u201d Gracious indeed. As another wealthy entrepreneur, Malcolm Turnbull, was once fond of saying. What. A. Time. To. Be. Alive. New York By the time we roll out of Chicago \u2013 a whistle stop characterised by a serious foreign policy pivot from Morrison, and an unfortunate photo opportunity in front of a McDonald\u2019s smart board that built a visual bridge to Engadine for people familiar with the infamous internet meme (let\u2019s just leave it at that) \u2013 and on to New York, the drumbeat is cacophonous, literally and figuratively. It is leader\u2019s week at the UN general assembly, and the area around the headquarters is locked down. The streets teem with protesters and delegates, and groups of Africans gather on Forty-fourth Street to drum and sing. The UNgeneral assembly circus drives New Yorkers bonkers, the streets are gridlocked and the eateries overflow, but the vibrancy of it is quite wonderful: the convivial murmur of languages on the east side of Midtown, the colour and style of the clothing, the downing of late-night whiskey amid animated conversation. Trump declares theatrically, with Nancy Pelosi closing in, during his address to the UN national assembly, that this is the time for patriots, not globalists. It\u2019s a soundbite crafted for Breitbart or Fox News, potent with his rusted-ons, but a hollow slogan in the world of facts and evidence. Did I miss the bit of history where globalisation became optional? For what it\u2019s worth, New York categorically ignores him. On the streets, in the stores, in the financial district, globalisation prevails. It\u2019s not even a contest. Beyond the literal, the figurative drumbeat is for Trump. Impeachment is closing in on the president. Some commentators say he looked subdued at the UN, which would be a rare lapse in self-confidence. The mood at the start of the week in Washington was come and get me suckers. But I\u2019m out of the presidential orbit now so I have no first-hand observation to report. Morrison, comprehensively overshadowed by movements in the tectonic plates of the major powers, ploughs on diligently with his UN program and seems unperturbed by the misfortune of his two mates, Boris Johnson and Trump, hitting some serious turbulence. If the prime minister had any regrets about taking hospitality from Trump and aligning Australia\u2019s diplomatic language precisely with the president on some thorny geopolitical issues, he certainly didn\u2019t show it. A certain defensiveness did creep in on climate change, though. Morrison wasn\u2019t cranky but there were persistent pesky questions from the travelling media about Australia\u2019s lack of policy ambition, and about his decision not to attend the UN climate summit on Monday. Even Trump called by. Why didn\u2019t Morrison? There was the sound of prime ministerial teeth being gritted. Interestingly, Morrison\u2019s speech to the UN general assembly, which was billed initially as being an address about practical environmentalism, not climate change, drifted back into climate. There was a significant chunk defending his government\u2019s policies, and some umbrage at the media for feeding false narratives \u2013 not fake news, mind you, but stoking prejudicial sentiment. In New York we meet our final billionaire, Mike Cannon-Brookes. The final piece of my triptych, the next gen mover and shaker, moves in different circles to Pratt and Rinehart. MCB didn\u2019t make the cut for the state dinner at the White House, evidently, but he made a bit of a splash at the UN. The Atlassian founder went to the climate summit to commit his company to a target of net zero emissions by no later than 2050. Cannon-Brookes nudged Morrison on Twitter: \u201cPlease give us a future we can believe in tomorrow. Inspire us. Lead us. Don\u2019t bullshit us. I\u2019m happy to help, as are millions of Aussies.\u201d I meet Cannon-Brookes at the Flower Shop, a hipster bar on the Lower East Side. His minders invited us down for a beverage. Most of my colleagues are punctual but I\u2019m late, because the traffic is terrible, and the bearded tech entrepreneur lobs late as well. There is an overwhelming smell of weed that eddies through the bar as we settle in, which I stress is not connected to anyone in our group or Atlassian\u2019s. I don\u2019t know who is responsible for this licentiousness and don\u2019t intend to investigate, frankly \u2013 but it\u2019s surreal, meeting a thirty-something billionaire in a bar as the bookend of this bonkers week, and having the bar reek of marijuana \u2013 that I find it hard to stop laughing at the unlikeliness of it all. It caps off the Through the Looking Glass sensation of the US odyssey. The evening is convivial and, unsurprisingly, there is much impassioned talk about climate change and energy policy and a fair sprinkling of acronyms \u2013 a bunch of Aussies jousting good naturedly about the future of the planet in a bar in Manhattan. I leave Cannon-Brookes downstairs shooting pool with a few stayers, settling in to welcome the dawn, and head uptown, clearing my head by walking up Forty-fifth Street as the dumpster trucks and the street sweepers move into high gear for the pre-dawn cleanse. I engage a cop at a checkpoint just to make sure I haven\u2019t veered wildly off course in a desperate bid for oxygen. \u201cThe Roosevelt is just up here,\u201d I inquire, \u201cright?\u201d The cop smiles and sips his coffee. \u201cI\u2019m from Brooklyn, m\u2019am.\u201d Support our independent journalism with a one-off or recurring contribution",

The more I think about it the less I can see why that statement was released. I do not understand what the intention was, other than perhaps to appease the public. The team of officials was selected by World Rugby so I don\u2019t see why the governing body has not backed its team. If it needs to, do the autopsy after the tournament but do everything you can to alleviate the stress on them at this stage.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/27/rugby-world-cup-australia-wales-teams\">Michael Cheika hits out at World Rugby over Hodge ban as Wallabies ring changes for Wales</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>To dig deeper into the debate however, we need to look at various stakeholders: World Rugby, the referees, the players, the broadcasters and the media and supporters. Looking at World Rugby first, there is a huge disparity between what it has said in public and how matches are being refereed.</p> \n<p>I was in favour of World Rugby coming out with its clampdown on high tackles before the start of the tournament. The World Cup has been taken to Japan, there are more eyes on the game than ever before so it was an important statement to make. But it only works if those goals are aligned in practice with how the referees operate and it is clear that has not been the case in the opening matches.</p> \n<p>So where does the responsibility lie? Some of the referees have just missed things. It happens, that\u2019s human error. There has never been a harder time to be a referee and we can\u2019t expect them to get every single decision right but they are under so much scrutiny. So many supporters have an in-depth knowledge of the laws nowadays. They can find clips of incidents, post them on social media and it is almost as if the citing takes place on Twitter first.</p> \n<p>I look to what Steve Hansen said before the New Zealand v South Africa game. He criticised Rassie Erasmus for trying to get into the ear of the referee and urged him to lay off because they have a hard enough job as it is. If Hansen is saying that even before the storm was whipped up, why on earth is World Rugby cranking up the pressure?</p> \n<p>After most rugby matches, the top international coaches will put their hands up and say that they themselves didn\u2019t quite get it right if their team underperforms. It\u2019s very rare that a coach will come out and say that the players just didn\u2019t perform. They may say it behind closed doors but not usually in public and that\u2019s what I felt World Rugby did.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c5b23ae47c0200c5a382b39520fcd1de82a53620\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c5b23ae47c0200c5a382b39520fcd1de82a53620/0_135_3000_2075/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Piers Francis has been cited for a high tackle on USA\u2019s Will Hooley.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"692\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Piers Francis has been cited for a high tackle on USA\u2019s Will Hooley.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ashley Western/MB Media/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>With regards to the players, it is of course really tough for them, the game is speeding up, the ball is in play a little longer, players are getting tired and having to adapt techniques that have been drummed into them. That isn\u2019t an excuse, it is just the reality. The margin for error is incredibly small. Look at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/26/reece-hodge-case-provides-unwanted-world-cup-distraction-for-wallabies\" title=\"\">the Reece Hodge</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/24/russia-samoa-rugby-world-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">Rey Lee-Lo</a> incidents \u2013 chalk and cheese but the same outcome. I feel sorry for Hodge. It\u2019s a stone cold red card but he is chasing across, Peceli Yato is stepping really late and Hodge is having to adjust at the last second. Is there sympathy for Lee-Lo almost taking someone\u2019s head off? Or for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/26/england-usa-rugby-world-cup-pool-c-match-report\" title=\"\">John Quill on Owen Farrell</a>? No. That was thuggish.

      "bodyText": "There have been some wonderful stories in the first week of the World Cup and some fantastic rugby played but it is unfortunate that the leading topic is the high tackle and refereeing controversies that are dominating the agenda in Japan. World Rugby is not solely to blame, even if I disagree entirely with the decision to go public with a statement slamming the referees. The more I think about it the less I can see why that statement was released. I do not understand what the intention was, other than perhaps to appease the public. The team of officials was selected by World Rugby so I don\u2019t see why the governing body has not backed its team. If it needs to, do the autopsy after the tournament but do everything you can to alleviate the stress on them at this stage. To dig deeper into the debate however, we need to look at various stakeholders: World Rugby, the referees, the players, the broadcasters and the media and supporters. Looking at World Rugby first, there is a huge disparity between what it has said in public and how matches are being refereed. I was in favour of World Rugby coming out with its clampdown on high tackles before the start of the tournament. The World Cup has been taken to Japan, there are more eyes on the game than ever before so it was an important statement to make. But it only works if those goals are aligned in practice with how the referees operate and it is clear that has not been the case in the opening matches. So where does the responsibility lie? Some of the referees have just missed things. It happens, that\u2019s human error. There has never been a harder time to be a referee and we can\u2019t expect them to get every single decision right but they are under so much scrutiny. So many supporters have an in-depth knowledge of the laws nowadays. They can find clips of incidents, post them on social media and it is almost as if the citing takes place on Twitter first. I look to what Steve Hansen said before the New Zealand v South Africa game. He criticised Rassie Erasmus for trying to get into the ear of the referee and urged him to lay off because they have a hard enough job as it is. If Hansen is saying that even before the storm was whipped up, why on earth is World Rugby cranking up the pressure? After most rugby matches, the top international coaches will put their hands up and say that they themselves didn\u2019t quite get it right if their team underperforms. It\u2019s very rare that a coach will come out and say that the players just didn\u2019t perform. They may say it behind closed doors but not usually in public and that\u2019s what I felt World Rugby did. With regards to the players, it is of course really tough for them, the game is speeding up, the ball is in play a little longer, players are getting tired and having to adapt techniques that have been drummed into them. That isn\u2019t an excuse, it is just the reality. The margin for error is incredibly small. Look at the Reece Hodge and Rey Lee-Lo incidents \u2013 chalk and cheese but the same outcome. I feel sorry for Hodge. It\u2019s a stone cold red card but he is chasing across, Peceli Yato is stepping really late and Hodge is having to adjust at the last second. Is there sympathy for Lee-Lo almost taking someone\u2019s head off? Or for John Quill on Owen Farrell? No. That was thuggish. We have to set a strong example that those techniques are no longer acceptable. Piers Francis has now been cited; it wasn\u2019t malicious \u2013 the adrenaline was pumping, he wanted to set his stall out. We\u2019re talking inches. If he hits him on the chest it\u2019s a yellow card but he struck him on the chin and he could well be going home. I\u2019ve never known a sport to be on such a knife edge. So what are the solutions? With rugby we really led the way with TMOs. We\u2019ve seen things such as Hawk-Eye and Snickometer follow. A fluid game was made even better and sharper.

The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the \u00a339bn divorce payment.</p>\n    <p>The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods.</p>\n    <p>The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports \u2013 making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO \u201cmost favoured nation\u201d rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.<br></p>\n    <p>WTO rules only cover goods \u2013 they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK\u2019s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.<br></p>\n    <p>Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article 24 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to 10 years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article 24 unilaterally \u2013 the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK\u2019s trading relationship.<br></p>\n    <p>The director general of the WTO, Roberto Azev\u00eado, has <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/economics-and-finance/jumping-from-league-one-to-league-three-wto-insiders-scathing-assessments-of-a-wto-brexit\">told Prospect magazine</a> that \u201cin simple factual terms in this scenario, you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the UK and EU where currently there are none\u201d.</p>\n    <p>Until some agreements are in place, a no-deal scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses \u2013 eg the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europe after 31 October if there is no deal. Those arguing for a \u201cmanaged\u201d no deal envisage that a range of smaller, sector-by-sector, bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.</p>\n    <p><b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a></b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Nicholl told him that he drew up the Operation Yellowhammer plans for his area of expertise.

Nicholl said he was not tempted to run against Rees-Mogg because Bromsgrove was his constituency and he would continue to work as a consultant at the Sandwell and West Birmingham NHS trust. \u201cI wanted to deliberately draw attention to Sajid Javid\u2019s poor judgment for appointing Matthew Elliott [the Vote Leave chief executive] as his campaign manager during the [Conservative] leadership election,\u201d he said describing Elliott as \u201cpart of the problem\u201d. Nicholl clashed with Rees-Mogg in early September over contingency plans for a no-deal Brexit he had drawn up for the government for epilepsy and neurology drugs. Rees-Mogg accused Nicholl of fearmongering and told him he \u201cshould be quite ashamed\u201d to \u201ctry to spread fear across the country\u201d over potential shortages of medicine caused by a no-deal Brexit. Nicholl told him that he drew up the Operation Yellowhammer plans for his area of expertise. The report outlined the probable consequences of the UK leaving the EU without a deal. He said he had blown the whistle on the plans because he felt they were unsafe. Days later Rees-Mogg, now leader of the House of Commons, was forced to apologise to him after comparing him to the disgraced anti-vaccine doctor Andrew Wakefield, prompting a backlash from the medical profession, including criticism from England\u2019s chief medical officer Dame Sally Davies. This prompted Nicholl to abandon work and join the protests outside parliament, commandeering anti-Brexiter Steve Bray\u2019s megaphone to accuse Rees-Mogg of using parliamentary privilege to attack whistleblowers. Nicholl said he would \u201ccertainly hope to get a lot of the remain\u201d votes in Bromsgrove and would rely on a 14-year campaign on the \u201crule of law\u201d to \u201cbring the fight to Sajid Javid\u201d. Nicholl campaigned for more than a decade to help free Shaker Aamer from the US camp in Cuba and he was finally released without charge in autumn 2015.",

      "bodyText": "Poundland is seeking to slash rents by a quarter as it renegotiates leases on nearly 90% of its stores over the next five years in a cost-cutting exercise before a potential initial public offering next year. The company expects to save \u00a320m through lower rents on its 840 stores as it battles against rising costs and heavy competition as well as suppliers\u2019 demands for upfront payment after credit insurers withdrew cover nearly two years ago. The chain is not expected to reduce its overall number of stores but will shift locations if it cannot get the rent cuts it wants when leases come up for renewal or if it finds better or larger sites nearby. On Friday Poundland\u2019s parent, Pepco Group, fuelled rumours of a potential sale or IPO by changing its name from Pepkor Europe and laying out plans to open about 300 shops a year across its three retail brands. The group, which is ultimately owned by South Africa\u2019s Steinhoff, said it would focus expansion on eastern Europe, where it operates the Pepco and Dealz chains. It also revealed that underlying profits would rise by 18% to about \u20ac325m (\u00a3289m) in the year to 30 September as sales increased by nearly 13% to \u20ac3.4bn, largely thanks to expansion across Europe. The Pepco chief executive, Andy Bond, a former Asda boss and a shareholder in Pepco, said the company had \u201can amazing performance given all the crap that has gone on around us\u201d. The group has refinanced with a \u20ac475m loan and further \u20ac130m credit facility to increase its independence from Steinhoff, which was hit by an accounting scandal in 2017. Steinhoff has said it wants to sell assets in order to reduce heavy debts and Pepco Group is seen to be a likely contender. Bond said: \u201cWe are an independent high-growth company \u2026 We want to be Europe\u2019s largest and most successful discount and variety business and we are confident we can get there.\u201d The group wants to open 1,000 more Pepco stores, which sell clothing and homewares, across existing territories including Poland, the Czech Republic and Romania, taking the total to more than 2,800. Bond said that Brexit would not affect plans for the group, which has its headquarters in Willenhall near Wolverhampton. The group is also expanding its European version of Poundland, Dealz, which operates in Spain and Ireland, with plans for 90 outlets in Poland by the end of this financial year and 350 over the next five years, up from just 35 now. Bond said Poundland was profitable but was looking to save costs and improve profits by selling more high-margin items such as clothing, at a broader array of prices than its traditional \u00a31 products.",

      "bodyText": "Night had fallen on one of the most dangerous cities in one of the most dangerous countries on Earth and Jos\u00e9 Mendoza was making his escape. \u201cSo much killing,\u201d the 32-year-old said as he began his punishing 2,000-mile odyssey to the United States on foot. Mendoza lived in San Pedro Sula, a gang-ridden industrial hub of about 700,000 in north-western Honduras where body-strewn tabloid front pages provide a grotesque daily reminder of the carnage. But \u2013 like thousands of violence-weary compatriots \u2013 he had decided he could bear the bloodletting no more and headed north, through Guatemala and Mexico, to the United States. \u201cThere are no reasons to stay here \u2013 only to leave,\u201d said Giovanni Rodr\u00edguez, a Honduran author who draws inspiration for his work from his days as a corpse-counting crime reporter on the mean streets of San Pedro Sula. For all the dangers fueling the exodus from Central America, Donald Trump now wants to turn the region into a destination for the thousands of unwanted asylum seekers he is battling to turn away from the United States. This week Trump officials unveiled the latest in a slew of highly controversial agreements and policies designed to stop migrants and asylum seekers such as Mendoza reaching the southern border. The deal \u2013 announced by Trump and his Honduran counterpart, Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez, on Wednesday \u2013 will allow the US to return asylum seekers from third countries to the violence-stricken Central American nation which has the US state department\u2019s second-highest travel warning. That followed similar accords with El Salvador and Guatemala, the two other countries that form Central America\u2019s \u201cNorthern Triangle\u201d. Mexico has also intensified its immigration clampdown since June after economic threats from Trump, causing a 56% drop in the arrival of undocumented migrants to the US\u2019s southern border. Speaking at the UN general assembly this week, Trump boasted he was taking \u201cvery unprecedented action to stop the flow of illegal immigration\u201d and warned those heading north not to come, \u201cbecause if you make it here, you will not be allowed in \u2013 you will be promptly returned home\u201d. US officials claim their hardline policies will protect migrants from the long and perilous journey through Central America and Mexico. But critics say returning often vulnerable migrants from countries in Central America, Africa and the Caribbean to unprepared and often extraordinarily violent cities such as San Pedro Sula is a recipe for disaster. Under this week\u2019s agreement, Haitian or Congolese asylum seekers could be sent from the US to Honduras, for example, while Honduran asylum seekers could be sent to El Salvador or Guatemala under the previous deals with those countries. Clara Long, an immigration researcher from Human Rights Watch, said: \u201cAs a protection scheme this is a nonsensical solution. As a scheme for keeping asylum seekers as far away from the US as possible it could be effective \u2013 and with very harmful consequences. \u201cEl Salvador has a staggeringly high homicide rate, similarly Honduras. Guatemala isn\u2019t as bad but it is still elevated. And these are countries from which hundreds of thousands of people are fleeing, many of them from targeted threats,\u201d Long added. Eric Olson, a Central America specialist from Washington\u2019s Woodrow Wilson Centre, said Northern Triangle countries lacked even the most basic institutional infrastructure to receive so many rejected asylum seekers. While the United States handled hundreds of thousands of asylum applications last year, El Salvador received just 20. \u201cWhat it does is put vulnerable, weak countries at greater risk, and migrants who have a legitimate claim to asylum are also put at greater risk. That is the bottom line,\u201d Olson said. \u201cWhen you have a weak and unstable country to begin with \u2026 and you add to that burden, I think you create greater instability. Maybe if it were Switzerland it wouldn\u2019t be a problem. But these are vulnerable, weak countries.\u201d Iduvina Hern\u00e1ndez, a Guatemalan journalist and human rights activist, said she feared her country\u2019s health system could collapse under the strain of the new arrivals. \u201cIf the health system is [already] unable to provide services to Guatemalans, how can it possibly provide services to hundreds of thousands of people from Honduras and El Salvador as well?\u201d she asked. \u201cIt will trigger a humanitarian crisis.\u201d Given the massive stress the US deals are likely to place on their countries, many wonder why El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala have signed up to such schemes, details of which remain sketchy. Hern\u00e1ndez said she suspected the US-Guatemala deal was \u201ca product of the [Guatemalan] president\u2019s need for impunity\u201d. Jimmy Morales, the country\u2019s outgoing leader, came to power nearly four years ago promising to battle corruption but has himself become embroiled in scandal with a UN-backed anti-corruption commission forced from the country earlier this month. There is similar speculation in Honduras, where President Hern\u00e1ndez is caught up in a major drug trafficking investigation which will see his brother go on trial in the US next month. Olson called such speculation \u201cpreposterous\u201d, arguing it would be impossible for a US president to guarantee impunity to any foreign leader. But the deals did underscore the lopsided nature of relations between the US and its far poorer regional neighbours who are massively reliant on it for trade, aid and remittances from their nationals who live there. \u201cI think it\u2019s an indication of how vulnerable these countries are vis-a-vis the Trump administration. The US carries a huge stick,\u201d Olson said. \u201cThere is too much at play for these small countries. They are just not in a position to resist the enormous pressure that the US puts on them.\u201d Trump has celebrated his migration deals as a major victory for his administration, this week claiming he had \u201csort of solved asylum\u201d. \u201cMass illegal migration is unfair, unsafe and unsustainable for everyone involved,\u201d Trump told the UN. But Long warned his project to bar asylum seekers and migrants would ultimately fail. \u201cNothing is changing about the circumstances forcing people to flee or their desperation. But things are changing to make the outcomes worse.\u201d \u201cIn the last 10 years more Hondurans have died than in 10 years of civil war in El Salvador,\u201d said Bartolo Fuentes, a Honduran migrant activist, who also believes Trump will be unable to stop migrants trying to outrun the killing. \u201cSometimes our death rates have gone above Syria\u2019s \u2013 and we don\u2019t have the war.\u201d",

I saw people who are usually quite shy of engaging in any kind of dissent rallying for signatures.\u201d</p> \n<p>Embrace, the BBC black and minority ethnic staff network, which has 500 members, said it had written to BBC bosses to \u201cconvey the strength of feeling of both black and minority ethnic staff and non black and minority ethnic staff\u201d about the decision. \u201cThis action will destroy trust and damage the reputation of the BBC, and needs to be reversed. We await an urgent response,\u201d it said.</p> \n<p>In the letter to Hall, organised by Labour\u2019s Seema Malhotra, the MPs called for an urgent meeting with the director genera. They said: \u201cIt is of particular concern that this decision has been reached when we are facing a rise in hate crime.\u201d</p> \n<p>The BBC\u2019s editorial standards director, David Jordan, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/sep/27/bbc-defends-censure-of-naga-munchetty-over-trump-comments\">attempted to defuse the situation on Friday</a>, telling Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that people may have \u201cwilfully\u201d misunderstood the nature of the ruling against Munchetty.</p> \n<p>He said there was no doubt that Trump\u2019s original comments were racist, agreed that it was entirely within Munchetty\u2019s right to describe those comments as racist on air, and said the presenter was allowed to provide analysis to viewers about how a person of colour felt when they were told to \u201cgo home\u201d.</p> \n<p>However, Jordan insisted she had breached editorial guidelines because she appeared to make a judgment on Trump\u2019s personality, saying it is not the BBC\u2019s job to be \u201ccalling out people for being liars or racist\u201d.</p> \n<p>He added: \u201cIn the politics of the present, when we are in a politics of name-calling and insult, I think it\u2019s probably unwise of the BBC to be calling out people for being liars or racist. What is really important is that we look at the things people say, we analyse them, we describe them objectively.\u201d</p> \n<p>Late on Friday afternoon in an email to all BBC staff, Hall and the BBC executive committee said: \u201cNaga Munchetty \u2013 one of our stars \u2013 was completely within her rights to speak about the tweets of Donald Trump which have been widely condemned as racist. We completely back her in saying \u2018as a woman of colour, to go back where I came from, that was embedded in racism\u2019. She was speaking honestly and from the heart about her own experiences. We admire her for it and she was completely justified in doing so.\u201d</p> \n<p>The email ended by saying that diversity was \u201cnot negotiable\u201d.</p> \n<p>One prominent black on-screen presenter said there was \u201cbafflement\u201d that Munchetty had been admonished when the likes of recently departed Today programme presenter John Humphrys were often perceived to have expressed personal opinions.</p> \n<p>They said the incident had led to discussions among some BAME journalists that they are used as \u201cwindow dressing\u201d by the corporation\u2019s news bosses, despite the BBC having one of the most diverse workforces in British media.</p> \n<p>In a letter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/27/racism-no-such-thing-as-impartiality-open-letter-bbc\">published in the Guardian</a>, the actors Lenny Henry, Adrian Lester and David Harewood, and presenters Krishnan Guru-Murthy and Gillian Joseph, are among signatories describing the decision as \u201cracially discriminatory treatment\u201d.</p> \n<p>The letter\u2019s signatories, who also include the broadcaster and writer Afua Hirsch and the science journalist Angela Saini, say that BBC journalists have contacted them privately to express concern about the \u201cclimate of fear\u201d at the organisation and concerns over the consequences of their speaking out in support of the statement.</p> \n<p>Among those who have also backed the presenter is the chancellor, Sajid Javid, who called the decision \u201cridiculous\u201d and added that Munchetty\u2019s reaction was \u201cperfectly understandable\u201d.</p> \n<p>Senior BBC news staff have raised concerns about the decision at the daily editorial management meetings.<br><br>\u201cPeople pointed out that Dan Walker encouraged that discussion,\u201d said one insider, who said there were real concerns among staff about how complaints system is not capable of dealing with members of the public acting in bad faith. \u201cIf Tommy Robinson is reading all of this he can just start complaining about BBC presenters day-in-day-out until one of the complaints lands.\u201d</p> \n<p>There have been particular concerns within parts of the BBC that have large numbers of journalists of colour, such as BBC World and Asian Network, where managers say they have struggled to explain the nuance of the corporation\u2019s own decision to confused staff.</p> \n<p>BBC sources suggested the corporation is now backed into a corner, with no easy way to undo the ruling given the quasi-independence of the complaints unit, leaving management essentially unable to defuse the situation. The ruling did not come out of the blue but followed discussions with programme chiefs at BBC Breakfast, which has been in the process of transferring to a new editor this summer.</p> \n<p>In an unusual move, Ofcom has agreed to assess Munchetty\u2019s exchange against its own broadcasting code after a request from the Labour MP Chi Onwurah. Its team are already reviewing the footage and a verdict on whether to launch an investigation is expected next week.</p> \n<p>This would potentially undermine the BBC\u2019s own complaints process and heighten calls for the corporation\u2019s complaints procedures to be entirely outsourced to Ofcom, which has responsibility for enforcing standards in the rest of the broadcast media. At the moment the BBC has a special opt-out for early-stage complaints.</p> \n<p>Munchetty has so far declined to comment on the row, which has focused attention on the editorial complaints unit, the seven-strong arbiter of BBC values that is dominated by older, white men.</p> \n<p>Many BBC journalists of colour have called for increased clarity on who works for the unit and greater diversity in the complaints process.</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/complaints/comp-reports/ecu/breakfastbbcone170719\">official finding</a> of the complaints unit found that Munchetty was wrong to comment critically on the possible motive for, and potential consequences of, the president\u2019s words: \u201cJudgments of that kind are for the audience to make, and the exchange fell short of due impartiality in that respect.\u201d</p> \n<p>At no point did Munchetty directly accuse Trump of being a racist in the brief exchange, which took place in response to questions on her personal feelings from her co-host, Walker.</p> \n<p>The Labour MP Clive Lewis has also filed an early day motion to allow members of parliament to object: \u201cYou can\u2019t be \u2018impartial\u2019 on racism. There are certain values in democratic society which transcend impartiality, and we\u2019re entitled to call them out.\u201d</p> \n<p>Lewis added: \u201cIt also goes to show that the level of BME representation at the BBC is only skin deep. It doesn\u2019t feel to me that there are enough people of colour in positions of editorial influence.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "The BBC is facing a growing crisis over its decision to censure the presenter Naga Munchetty over comments she made about Donald Trump, amid a furious backlash inside and outside the corporation. The BBC Breakfast presenter was found to have breached her employer\u2019s editorial guidelines when she told viewers she felt \u201cabsolutely furious\u201d about the US president\u2019s language, shortly after he told four Democratic congresswomen of colour, all US citizens, to \u201cgo home\u201d. The corporation\u2019s executive complaints unit partially upheld a single complaint from a member of the public, leading to a staff revolt and growing anger at how the BBC balances its duty to staff and audiences when it comes to issues of race. As the row developed: Dozens of prominent black British media figures \u2013 including Sir Lenny Henry and Adrian Lester \u2013 wrote to the Guardian to protest against the decision and call for increased representation for BAME individuals in the BBC\u2019s complaints process. Serving BBC journalists defied warnings from their bosses to stay quiet on the issue and publicly expressed their support for Munchetty. More than 40 Labour MPs wrote to the BBC director general, Tony Hall, in protest, with the backing of party leader Jeremy Corbyn. The media regulator, Ofcom, took the unusual step of launching its own parallel assessment. BBC employees are circulating petitions demanding the decision is reconsidered, with one journalist saying it had galvanised staff in a way that few issues have before. \u201cPeople are dismayed by the decision and I don\u2019t think the upper level [of management] saw it coming. I saw people who are usually quite shy of engaging in any kind of dissent rallying for signatures.\u201d Embrace, the BBC black and minority ethnic staff network, which has 500 members, said it had written to BBC bosses to \u201cconvey the strength of feeling of both black and minority ethnic staff and non black and minority ethnic staff\u201d about the decision. \u201cThis action will destroy trust and damage the reputation of the BBC, and needs to be reversed. We await an urgent response,\u201d it said. In the letter to Hall, organised by Labour\u2019s Seema Malhotra, the MPs called for an urgent meeting with the director genera. They said: \u201cIt is of particular concern that this decision has been reached when we are facing a rise in hate crime.\u201d The BBC\u2019s editorial standards director, David Jordan, attempted to defuse the situation on Friday, telling Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that people may have \u201cwilfully\u201d misunderstood the nature of the ruling against Munchetty. He said there was no doubt that Trump\u2019s original comments were racist, agreed that it was entirely within Munchetty\u2019s right to describe those comments as racist on air, and said the presenter was allowed to provide analysis to viewers about how a person of colour felt when they were told to \u201cgo home\u201d. However, Jordan insisted she had breached editorial guidelines because she appeared to make a judgment on Trump\u2019s personality, saying it is not the BBC\u2019s job to be \u201ccalling out people for being liars or racist\u201d. He added: \u201cIn the politics of the present, when we are in a politics of name-calling and insult, I think it\u2019s probably unwise of the BBC to be calling out people for being liars or racist. What is really important is that we look at the things people say, we analyse them, we describe them objectively.\u201d Late on Friday afternoon in an email to all BBC staff, Hall and the BBC executive committee said: \u201cNaga Munchetty \u2013 one of our stars \u2013 was completely within her rights to speak about the tweets of Donald Trump which have been widely condemned as racist. We completely back her in saying \u2018as a woman of colour, to go back where I came from, that was embedded in racism\u2019. She was speaking honestly and from the heart about her own experiences. We admire her for it and she was completely justified in doing so.\u201d The email ended by saying that diversity was \u201cnot negotiable\u201d. One prominent black on-screen presenter said there was \u201cbafflement\u201d that Munchetty had been admonished when the likes of recently departed Today programme presenter John Humphrys were often perceived to have expressed personal opinions. They said the incident had led to discussions among some BAME journalists that they are used as \u201cwindow dressing\u201d by the corporation\u2019s news bosses, despite the BBC having one of the most diverse workforces in British media. In a letter published in the Guardian, the actors Lenny Henry, Adrian Lester and David Harewood, and presenters Krishnan Guru-Murthy and Gillian Joseph, are among signatories describing the decision as \u201cracially discriminatory treatment\u201d. The letter\u2019s signatories, who also include the broadcaster and writer Afua Hirsch and the science journalist Angela Saini, say that BBC journalists have contacted them privately to express concern about the \u201cclimate of fear\u201d at the organisation and concerns over the consequences of their speaking out in support of the statement. Among those who have also backed the presenter is the chancellor, Sajid Javid, who called the decision \u201cridiculous\u201d and added that Munchetty\u2019s reaction was \u201cperfectly understandable\u201d. Senior BBC news staff have raised concerns about the decision at the daily editorial management meetings. \u201cPeople pointed out that Dan Walker encouraged that discussion,\u201d said one insider, who said there were real concerns among staff about how complaints system is not capable of dealing with members of the public acting in bad faith. \u201cIf Tommy Robinson is reading all of this he can just start complaining about BBC presenters day-in-day-out until one of the complaints lands.\u201d There have been particular concerns within parts of the BBC that have large numbers of journalists of colour, such as BBC World and Asian Network, where managers say they have struggled to explain the nuance of the corporation\u2019s own decision to confused staff. BBC sources suggested the corporation is now backed into a corner, with no easy way to undo the ruling given the quasi-independence of the complaints unit, leaving management essentially unable to defuse the situation. The ruling did not come out of the blue but followed discussions with programme chiefs at BBC Breakfast, which has been in the process of transferring to a new editor this summer. In an unusual move, Ofcom has agreed to assess Munchetty\u2019s exchange against its own broadcasting code after a request from the Labour MP Chi Onwurah. Its team are already reviewing the footage and a verdict on whether to launch an investigation is expected next week. This would potentially undermine the BBC\u2019s own complaints process and heighten calls for the corporation\u2019s complaints procedures to be entirely outsourced to Ofcom, which has responsibility for enforcing standards in the rest of the broadcast media. At the moment the BBC has a special opt-out for early-stage complaints. Munchetty has so far declined to comment on the row, which has focused attention on the editorial complaints unit, the seven-strong arbiter of BBC values that is dominated by older, white men. Many BBC journalists of colour have called for increased clarity on who works for the unit and greater diversity in the complaints process. The official finding of the complaints unit found that Munchetty was wrong to comment critically on the possible motive for, and potential consequences of, the president\u2019s words: \u201cJudgments of that kind are for the audience to make, and the exchange fell short of due impartiality in that respect.\u201d At no point did Munchetty directly accuse Trump of being a racist in the brief exchange, which took place in response to questions on her personal feelings from her co-host, Walker. The Labour MP Clive Lewis has also filed an early day motion to allow members of parliament to object: \u201cYou can\u2019t be \u2018impartial\u2019 on racism. There are certain values in democratic society which transcend impartiality, and we\u2019re entitled to call them out.\u201d Lewis added: \u201cIt also goes to show that the level of BME representation at the BBC is only skin deep. It doesn\u2019t feel to me that there are enough people of colour in positions of editorial influence.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Since 2016, Britain and the United States have grappled with a shared fate, facing down the conjoined twins of populism: Brexit and Trump. This week, at long last, came the first signs of a reckoning. After three years in which the winners of 2016 have mocked, pushed or trampled on the constitutional constraints that sustain a liberal democracy, the constitutions \u2013 on both sides of the Atlantic \u2013 struck back.</p> \n<p>The mechanisms are different of course, but the convergence of these two connected stories has been uncanny all the same. The 11 judges of the UK supreme court cancelled Boris Johnson\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/sep/24/boris-johnsons-suspension-of-parliament-unlawful-supreme-court-rules-prorogue\" title=\"\">unlawful suspension</a> of parliament on the very day the House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, put aside her previous misgivings and launched an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/24/pelosi-impeachment-inquiry-trump-ukraine\" title=\"\">impeachment inquiry</a> against Donald Trump.</p> \n<p>Pelosi closed her announcement with a declaration that could serve as a precis of the judgment read out that morning by supreme court president, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/sep/24/lady-hale-career-breaking-barriers-judiciary\" title=\"\">Lady Hale</a>: \u201cNo one is above the law.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Right now impeachment looks doomed to fail</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>As if to reinforce the point, in a touch which seemed almost too on-the-nose, that same day also saw <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2019/sep/24/hes-not-going-anywhere-trump-shows-support-for-johnson-video\" title=\"\">Boris Johnson and Trump</a> appear side by side at the UN in New York \u2013 Trump joking that a ruling by Britain\u2019s highest court that the prime minister had acted illegally was \u201cjust another day in the office\u201d. Smiling and joshing, they looked like partners in crime.</p> \n<p>The similarities between these two convulsions, separated by an ocean, range from the trivial to the grave. In the first category, how odd that in both countries the anointed tribune for anti-elite rage and channel for pent-up, nativist fury is a wealthy child of privilege once inseparably associated with the ultra-liberal metropolis. Johnson was the mayor of London who backed an amnesty for undocumented immigrants, Trump the Manhattan socialite who supported abortion rights and gun control. Yet both now pose as champions of the forgotten heartlands against the liberal establishment.</p> \n<p>In the second, more serious category, hovering over the turmoil in both Britain and the US has been the threat of violence. During the 2016 EU referendum campaign, MP Jo Cox was murdered; a few weeks later, Trump <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/10/us/politics/donald-trump-hillary-clinton.html\" title=\"\">hinted</a> that gun owners might deal with Hillary Clinton by taking the law into their own hands.</p> \n<p>This week, the Commons gasped as Johnson dismissed as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2019/sep/25/outrage-as-boris-johnson-dismisses-dangers-of-inflammatory-language-as-humbug-video\" title=\"\">\u201chumbug\u201d</a> a pained plea to learn the lesson of Cox\u2019s murder and drop the inflammatory talk of \u201csurrender\u201d and \u201cbetrayal\u201d, language that has been adopted in the death threats that have rained down on so many MPs, women especially. In New York, Trump greeted the testimony of an unnamed whistleblower \u2013 who had revealed that the president had pressed the leader of Ukraine, needy for financial aid, to \u201cdo us a favour\u201d and dig for dirt on a political rival \u2013 with a barely veiled <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/9/26/20885603/trump-ukraine-whistleblower-spy-treason-threat\" title=\"\">threat</a> of his own: \u201cYou know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? The spies and treason, we used to handle it a little differently than we do now.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"726eebbd-fc5e-41a5-8752-a12d293b2472\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yD-4vs7He6M?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>What connects these two battles most, however, is that they are framed the same way. Both the Brexiters and Trump insist they are locked in a titanic struggle between \u201cthe people\u201d \u2013 with \u201cBoris\u201d or Trump as their champions \u2013 and the hated elite, comprised of anyone who might thwart their will: judges, journalists or even elected representatives. This leads in turn to the dilemma that has confronted those who would oppose Brexit or Trump. Is it wise to mount a challenge when that very challenge will confirm and strengthen the frame that Trump or the Brexiters have constructed? Put another way, is it wise to fight a populist when a fight is exactly what they want?</p> \n<p>In Britain, the dilemma was visible during that ugly Wednesday night in the Commons. Those MPs speaking of their alarm at the increasingly incendiary rhetoric of the Brexit debate had their anxiety etched on their faces. But Johnson was untroubled, insouciant throughout. That might have been because a debate about language provides a handy distraction from the week\u2019s central fact, the supreme court ruling, allowing him to wave aside that verdict as if it were a mere opinion with which he disagreed. (That\u2019s not how the law works. It is not a court\u2019s opinion that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/peter-sutcliffe\" title=\"\">Peter Sutcliffe</a> was a murderer; it is a fact.)</p> \n<p>But might it not also have been because Johnson welcomes the outrage of a few teary MPs and their defenders on Twitter? After all, that\u2019s apparently been the Johnson strategy since the start: keep on acting appallingly, keep goading the remainers, keep inviting them to denounce and block you all the way to an election that you can fight as \u201cthe people v the elite\u201d. A debate about whether it\u2019s appropriate to brand a law preventing a no-deal Brexit as \u201cthe surrender act\u201d works well for Johnson, just as the row over the bogus \u00a3350m did in 2016, not least because it ensures the idea gets repeated on the airwaves ad nauseam: surrender, surrender, surrender.</p> \n<p>In the US, Pelosi was reluctant to move to impeachment because she feared it would give Trump the fight he relished. There they go again, he\u2019d say, Democrats and their friends in the \u201cfake news media\u201d using tricks to remove a president that you, the people, elected fair and square. He could play the victim, howling about witch-hunts and \u201cpresidential harassment\u201d, tapping into the deep sense of grievance that animates his base. The circus of televised hearings would provide precisely the polarised chaos in which he thrives.</p> \n<p>There are plenty of other good reasons not to go ahead. Right now impeachment looks doomed to fail: it requires the votes of 67 senators to remove a president from office, which means the defection of 20 Republicans. The liberal Republican wing whose desertion spelled the end for Richard Nixon is all but vanished now: the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/03/what-have-tory-rebels-voted-for-and-will-an-election-now-happen\" title=\"\">21 brave Tories</a> who broke from Johnson have few counterparts on Capitol Hill. The notion of US public opinion shifting en masse against Trump is a stretch, too. US media consumption is now so partisan that Trump\u2019s base will only ever hear a story that exonerates him from guilt.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"8e23cecd-2522-407e-bb53-989b0937aa05\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1Q-pdDV_Fqk?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The truth of Watergate was near-universally accepted in 1974; it\u2019s hard to imagine anything being universally accepted now. What\u2019s more, impeachment will consume Democratic energies, distracting them from their ongoing primary contest. When Democrats should be talking to US voters about healthcare, jobs and the climate crisis, they\u2019ll be talking instead about Ukraine, transcripts and secret servers.</p> \n<p>And yet they have no real choice.

      "bodyText": "Since 2016, Britain and the United States have grappled with a shared fate, facing down the conjoined twins of populism: Brexit and Trump. This week, at long last, came the first signs of a reckoning. After three years in which the winners of 2016 have mocked, pushed or trampled on the constitutional constraints that sustain a liberal democracy, the constitutions \u2013 on both sides of the Atlantic \u2013 struck back. The mechanisms are different of course, but the convergence of these two connected stories has been uncanny all the same. The 11 judges of the UK supreme court cancelled Boris Johnson\u2019s unlawful suspension of parliament on the very day the House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, put aside her previous misgivings and launched an impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump. Pelosi closed her announcement with a declaration that could serve as a precis of the judgment read out that morning by supreme court president, Lady Hale: \u201cNo one is above the law.\u201d As if to reinforce the point, in a touch which seemed almost too on-the-nose, that same day also saw Boris Johnson and Trump appear side by side at the UN in New York \u2013 Trump joking that a ruling by Britain\u2019s highest court that the prime minister had acted illegally was \u201cjust another day in the office\u201d. Smiling and joshing, they looked like partners in crime. The similarities between these two convulsions, separated by an ocean, range from the trivial to the grave. In the first category, how odd that in both countries the anointed tribune for anti-elite rage and channel for pent-up, nativist fury is a wealthy child of privilege once inseparably associated with the ultra-liberal metropolis. Johnson was the mayor of London who backed an amnesty for undocumented immigrants, Trump the Manhattan socialite who supported abortion rights and gun control. Yet both now pose as champions of the forgotten heartlands against the liberal establishment. In the second, more serious category, hovering over the turmoil in both Britain and the US has been the threat of violence. During the 2016 EU referendum campaign, MP Jo Cox was murdered; a few weeks later, Trump hinted that gun owners might deal with Hillary Clinton by taking the law into their own hands. This week, the Commons gasped as Johnson dismissed as \u201chumbug\u201d a pained plea to learn the lesson of Cox\u2019s murder and drop the inflammatory talk of \u201csurrender\u201d and \u201cbetrayal\u201d, language that has been adopted in the death threats that have rained down on so many MPs, women especially. In New York, Trump greeted the testimony of an unnamed whistleblower \u2013 who had revealed that the president had pressed the leader of Ukraine, needy for financial aid, to \u201cdo us a favour\u201d and dig for dirt on a political rival \u2013 with a barely veiled threat of his own: \u201cYou know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? The spies and treason, we used to handle it a little differently than we do now.\u201d What connects these two battles most, however, is that they are framed the same way. Both the Brexiters and Trump insist they are locked in a titanic struggle between \u201cthe people\u201d \u2013 with \u201cBoris\u201d or Trump as their champions \u2013 and the hated elite, comprised of anyone who might thwart their will: judges, journalists or even elected representatives. This leads in turn to the dilemma that has confronted those who would oppose Brexit or Trump. Is it wise to mount a challenge when that very challenge will confirm and strengthen the frame that Trump or the Brexiters have constructed? Put another way, is it wise to fight a populist when a fight is exactly what they want? In Britain, the dilemma was visible during that ugly Wednesday night in the Commons. Those MPs speaking of their alarm at the increasingly incendiary rhetoric of the Brexit debate had their anxiety etched on their faces. But Johnson was untroubled, insouciant throughout. That might have been because a debate about language provides a handy distraction from the week\u2019s central fact, the supreme court ruling, allowing him to wave aside that verdict as if it were a mere opinion with which he disagreed. (That\u2019s not how the law works. It is not a court\u2019s opinion that Peter Sutcliffe was a murderer; it is a fact.) But might it not also have been because Johnson welcomes the outrage of a few teary MPs and their defenders on Twitter? After all, that\u2019s apparently been the Johnson strategy since the start: keep on acting appallingly, keep goading the remainers, keep inviting them to denounce and block you all the way to an election that you can fight as \u201cthe people v the elite\u201d. A debate about whether it\u2019s appropriate to brand a law preventing a no-deal Brexit as \u201cthe surrender act\u201d works well for Johnson, just as the row over the bogus \u00a3350m did in 2016, not least because it ensures the idea gets repeated on the airwaves ad nauseam: surrender, surrender, surrender. In the US, Pelosi was reluctant to move to impeachment because she feared it would give Trump the fight he relished. There they go again, he\u2019d say, Democrats and their friends in the \u201cfake news media\u201d using tricks to remove a president that you, the people, elected fair and square. He could play the victim, howling about witch-hunts and \u201cpresidential harassment\u201d, tapping into the deep sense of grievance that animates his base. The circus of televised hearings would provide precisely the polarised chaos in which he thrives. There are plenty of other good reasons not to go ahead. Right now impeachment looks doomed to fail: it requires the votes of 67 senators to remove a president from office, which means the defection of 20 Republicans. The liberal Republican wing whose desertion spelled the end for Richard Nixon is all but vanished now: the 21 brave Tories who broke from Johnson have few counterparts on Capitol Hill. The notion of US public opinion shifting en masse against Trump is a stretch, too. US media consumption is now so partisan that Trump\u2019s base will only ever hear a story that exonerates him from guilt. The truth of Watergate was near-universally accepted in 1974; it\u2019s hard to imagine anything being universally accepted now. What\u2019s more, impeachment will consume Democratic energies, distracting them from their ongoing primary contest. When Democrats should be talking to US voters about healthcare, jobs and the climate crisis, they\u2019ll be talking instead about Ukraine, transcripts and secret servers. And yet they have no real choice. The politics of it may be fraught with risk, but it is their duty. The already known facts of the Ukraine episode establish a clear abuse of presidential power: Trump used the might of his office to advance not the country\u2019s interest but his own. Nor can you argue that the remedy for such behaviour is an (upcoming) election, because Trump\u2019s abuse was aimed at subverting that very election. Democrats face the same logic that confronted Johnson\u2019s opponents. Perhaps, politically, it would have played better not to have a wealthy Londoner such as Gina Miller sue the government. Maybe it did look bad having 11 judges strike down the Brexiters\u2019 champion, thereby confirming every Brexiters\u2019 suspicion about the \u201cremain elite\u201d. But the alternative was to let Johnson\u2019s suspension stand, so that a future prime minister could sweep aside an inconvenient parliament, and its irritating scrutiny, whenever they chose and for however long they liked. Perhaps impeachment will hand Trump a reality TV showdown he\u2019ll love.

Despite the horror with which many Labour MPs greeted Johnson\u2019s bellicose performance in the Commons on Wednesday, No 10 still believes there will be intense pressure on those MPs who represent leave constituencies to support a deal. \u201cIf we came back with a deal, I think there would be real political pressure to really push through: if you\u2019re in a Brexit seat, do you really want to go into an election having rejected Brexit?\u201d the government source said. Meanwhile, Johnson will try and use his conference platform to attack parliament for attempting to thwart his negotiating strategy \u2013 and switch the focus back to domestic policy announcements, including on the NHS, law and order and the cost of living. Internal polling is telling the Tories that the prime minister is now more trusted than Corbyn on the NHS, and the Labour leader is regarded as weak \u2013 a message they plan to hammer home ruthlessly in the weeks ahead. They believe Johnson would perform well in head-to-head debates with Corbyn, despite their one clash at prime minister\u2019s questions being widely regarded as a win for the Labour leader. \u201cWe\u2019ll be cock a hoop,\u201d said the government source. \u201cWe\u2019ll have 10 a day, stick them in.\u201d Theresa May also hoped to capitalise on questions about Corbyn\u2019s leadership during the 2017 general election campaign, at one point warning he would go \u201cnaked into the negotiating chamber\u201d for Brexit talks. But the electorate responded by stripping the Tories of their majority. Labour strategists are battling to find the best way of burnishing Corbyn\u2019s anti-establishment credentials, as Johnson tries to paint himself as the champion of the people against scheming MPs. They say the slogan \u201cpeople v privilege\u201d, trailed at Labour conference in Brighton, strikes a chord with voters in focus groups. Rudd, who quit the government and resigned the Conservative whip earlier this month in protest at the prime minister\u2019s policies, also told the Evening Standard that she might stand in London as an \u201cindependent Conservative\u201d at the next general election. Amid bitter complaints about Johnson\u2019s use of words such as \u201csurrender\u201d and \u201cbetrayal\u201d over Brexit, and his subsequent refusal to apologise, Rudd said she had been \u201cdisappointed and stunned\u201d when the PM dismissed the fears of female MPs about a possible repeat of the 2016 murder of Jo Cox. Asked about the Downing Street approach of couching Brexit as a battle between the people and a remain-minded parliament, Rudd said: \u201cThe sort of language I\u2019m afraid we\u2019ve seen more and more of coming out from No 10 does incite violence. It\u2019s the sort of language people think legitimises a more aggressive approach and sometimes violence.\u201d Comparing Johnson\u2019s approach to that of Donald Trump during the 2016 US presidential election, Rudd said \u201cthe casual approach to safety of MPs and their staff [was] immoral\u201d, and urged ministers to \u201cconsider their own judgments rather than be desperately loyal\u201d. Rudd is not planning to attend conference; but some of the other 21 rebels who had the whip removed for voting for the Benn Act do plan to attend, including former justice secretary David Gauke. The House of Commons voted against granting the government a three-day break so that conference could be held; but Johnson plans to press ahead, leaving one junior \u201cduty minister\u201d for each department behind in London. He is expected to deliver his set-piece conference speech as planned on Wednesday, leaving Dominic Raab to stand in for prime minister\u2019s questions back in London. Meanwhile opposition MPs hoping to thwart Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit strategy will spend next week working on a fresh anti no-deal action plan. If the prime minister breaks the terms of the Benn Act, which compels him to ask for an extension to Article 50 if he can\u2019t get a Brexit deal, they want to be able to implement a plan \u201cwithin minutes\u201d. The legislation, spearheaded by Labour MP Hilary Benn, and backed by Labour and rebel ex-Tories including former chancellor Phillip Hammond, demands that the prime minister ask Brussels for an extension to the Brexit process by 19 October if he has not brokered a new agreement. However, they insist they will not seek to wreck the Tory conference by attempting to take over the order paper, or table new laws and emergency debates. Instead, they are expected to pepper ministers with a host of urgent questions instead. A source close to the rebels said: \u201cNext week is all about planning scenarios for if Boris Johnson breaks the law.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s going to be the cross-party group meeting to work out what action could be taken in the event Johnson does break the law.\u201d They said this could involve legislation but have also not ruled out another confidence vote in the Prime Minister, that could in theory trigger a general election. Meetings among the group of politicians working to stop no-deal, including Labour\u2019s shadow Brexit Secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, the then Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster David Lidington and former chancellor Philip Hammond, representatives of the Liberal Democrats and SNP took place as early as June.",

While his own career has flourished in recent years, he can still remember how tough times were for him before a link with Roger Charlton and Cityscape catapulted him into the big time in 2012.</p> \n<p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I was definitely depressed,\u201d Doyle reflected, \u201cbut I was certainly very low at a period in my career when I was doing all the hard yards, putting in all the hours in the car and sweating and not really getting anywhere.\u201d Charlton recently described the jockey as having been \u201ca bit depressed\u201d before joining his yard.</p> \n<p>Doyle discussed the issue of mental health with the British sprinter Adam Gemili in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKOc3gvXeDA&amp;feature=youtu.be\">a video made by Great British Racing</a> in which the pair reflect on the different pressures created by their sports. Doyle noted that, while horse racing brings almost constant scrutiny, it at least affords a quick chance to atone.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe might be racing 10 times a day and one race might not go so well but the next one might go super-well and suddenly you\u2019ve gone from villain to hero in half an hour. Adam\u2019s races are obviously a lot more spread out.\u201d</p> \n<p>In conversation with Gemili, Doyle remembered <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFvqIwxFl_o\">the Falmouth Stakes</a>, in which he was a close second on One Master, as being the trigger for some especially harsh criticism directed at him through Twitter. But he has never considered ditching his social media accounts.</p> \n<p>\u201cI enjoy it. I think I was one of the early people to go on it and, whilst you do get a lot of abuse on there, I find it\u2019s a pretty even spread, with abuse and praise.</p> \n<p>\u201cEveryone\u2019s different. I find it entertaining sometimes, especially when the comments are completely unjust. You just have to laugh at it and move on. I wouldn\u2019t be one to start retaliating in any way.\u201d</p> \n<p>Gemili told Doyle that a sports psychologist has helped him. The jockey has no plans to try anything similar but says: \u201cI have friends that probably fit that role without actually being psychologists. I\u2019ve got a good group of friends around me that I can speak to after racing and I find that very helpful. Some are in racing, some aren\u2019t.</p> \n<p>\u201cFor instance, Royal Ascot, a place where we all want to ride winners but it\u2019s very difficult to do so. Say you\u2019re going there with a good book of rides and things don\u2019t go to plan, it\u2019s always nice to have someone you can call and reflect on it, maybe not even talk about the races, talk about something completely different altogether.\u201d</p> \n<p>Doyle concedes that depression is still rarely discussed in the weighing room, though this week\u2019s news that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/26/william-carson-banned-jockey-took-lines-cocaine-two-days-before-riding-horse-racing\">William Carson has been </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/26/william-carson-banned-jockey-took-lines-cocaine-two-days-before-riding-horse-racing\">talking about it</a> could change that. Help is available for jockeys who find themselves struggling. \u201cThe Professional Jockeys Association is very good,\u201d Doyle adds. \u201cWe have helplines we can call and they work very closely with the jockeys and know them well.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKOc3gvXeDA\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tKOc3gvXeDA?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p><em>\u2022 QIPCO British Champions Day takes place at Ascot Racecourse on Saturday 19 October.

      "bodyText": "The Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, has said the EU is facing a \u201cmoment of truth\u201d next week after his latest round of talks with Michel Barnier ended with both sides seeking to shift the blame for the impasse. The UK government is expected by EU officials to table formal proposals next Thursday after the Conservative party conference, but talks on Friday wound up in apparent acrimony. With the two sides sharply divided, both the EU and the UK sought to lay responsibility for the lack of agreement on the other, in a sign of the futility of the recent negotiations. The European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, said the ignominy for a lack of a deal would lie with the UK. \u201cIf this fails in the end, the responsibility lies solely with the British side,\u201d he said. Barclay told reporters there \u201cneeds to be political will on both sides and we\u2019re now approaching the moment of truth in these negotiations\u201d. He added: \u201cWe are committed to securing a deal, the prime minister has made clear he wants a deal but there has to be political will on both sides and that\u2019s what we\u2019re exploring.\u201d Barclay and Barnier clashed in correspondence over no-deal contingency measures with the British cabinet minister seeking greater cooperation. Barnier insisted that he would not accept \u201cmini deals\u201d and that the withdrawal agreement was the only vehicle for dealing with the outstanding issues. It is understood that the French government is insisting that serious proposals must be seen within a week, complaining that they do not want Brexit to overshadow other issues when EU leaders meet at a summit on 17 October. Berlin has privately described the papers so far put forward as \u201ccompletely insufficient\u201d, according to a leaked diplomatic note of a recent meeting of ambassadors in Brussels, seen by the Guardian. It is understood formal papers will be presented next by the UK but there is growing and grave scepticism in Brussels that the British government will be able to produce anything reasonable for EU leaders to sign off on 17 October. The UK has insisted Northern Ireland cannot be \u201cleft behind\u201d in the EU\u2019s single market and shared customs territory, nor can the whole of the UK be \u201ctrapped\u201d in the bloc\u2019s structures simply to avoid a hard border. Barclay emphasised in a recent speech in Madrid that any deal must recognise there will be two regulatory zones on the island of Ireland. The government says controls and checks on trade through the border can be done in a light-touch way to ensure there is no infrastructure or huge changes to the local economy. The EU has said that, as yet, there does not appear to be any solution beyond Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland remaining in regulatory alignment. \u201cWhat they are proposing is for us to ignore huge blocks of EU law \u2013 make massive derogations for them,\u201d a source said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t work.\u201d On the eve of his meeting with Barclay, Barnier had told EU ambassadors that the proposals so far tabled by the UK were not workable. He reiterated that time was running out, adding in an aside that the dramatic scenes in Westminster did not offer much confidence that a majority for any deal could be found. \u201cBut the biggest obstacle to a deal remains the absence until now of serious, workable proposals,\u201d a source said. Several EU diplomats told Barnier the UK would have to table \u201cserious\u201d plans to replace the Irish backstop by the end of next week \u2013 immediately after the Conservative party conference in Manchester. \u201cThe clock is ticking, after that, time would be in too short supply,\u201d an EU diplomat said. But the person added that the mood around the table was highly sceptical that it would be possible to agree a deal, also because of the political situation in London. If the UK fails to produce proposals within the next seven days, EU diplomats say their governments will not have enough time to assess the politically sensitive and deeply technical issues at stake. The pessimistic mood deepened after the UK presented earlier this week its latest discussion paper on breaking the backstop deadlock \u2013 a six-page document on moving food, animal and plant products between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, as part of a plan for an all-Ireland agri-food zone. EU diplomats are unhappy that the UK seems to be picking holes in the logic of the EU\u2019s strict rules on food, animal and plant safety (sanitary and phytosanitary measures). \u201cIf you are staying in our SPS zone you don\u2019t get to start second guessing the logic of it,\u201d said one source, describing the mood. \u201cI sense an extra frustration.

However, he is rather dismissive of tree-planting schemes which, based on our experience in Devon, do not have to be as he describes. Instead he wants to allow natural regeneration.</p> <p>Leaving aside the fact that it is slower than planting trees (and for the climate\u2019s sake we need some speed here), there are also problems with promoting regeneration. As shown by the excellent work of Jed Kaplan and others, deforestation in northern Europe, including Britain, started as long as 3,000 years ago. By the time of the Norman Conquest, different areas of southern Britain had between 0% and 40% of the original cover. Many of the deforested areas in Britain today are not under agriculture or grazing, nor kept bare for shooting. Undoubtedly woodland or forest would be the climax vegetation in these areas, but they are still not wooded. One of the main reasons is wild grazing animals that are part of the current ecosystem. If we really want to reforest by \u201cnatural\u201d means then we will need to deal with this in some way.<br><strong>John Bryant</strong><br><em>Topsham, Devon</em></p> <p>\u2022 I share George Monbiot\u2019s misgivings about tree-planting and plastic, but I wish he would treat the 200 generations of humans who have left evidence of their life and work in our uplands with some respect.

      "bodyText": "George Monbiot (Rewilding will make Britain a rainforest nation again, Journal, 25 September) makes a timely call to reforest large areas of Britain. However, he is rather dismissive of tree-planting schemes which, based on our experience in Devon, do not have to be as he describes. Instead he wants to allow natural regeneration. Leaving aside the fact that it is slower than planting trees (and for the climate\u2019s sake we need some speed here), there are also problems with promoting regeneration. As shown by the excellent work of Jed Kaplan and others, deforestation in northern Europe, including Britain, started as long as 3,000 years ago. By the time of the Norman Conquest, different areas of southern Britain had between 0% and 40% of the original cover. Many of the deforested areas in Britain today are not under agriculture or grazing, nor kept bare for shooting. Undoubtedly woodland or forest would be the climax vegetation in these areas, but they are still not wooded. One of the main reasons is wild grazing animals that are part of the current ecosystem. If we really want to reforest by \u201cnatural\u201d means then we will need to deal with this in some way. John Bryant Topsham, Devon \u2022 I share George Monbiot\u2019s misgivings about tree-planting and plastic, but I wish he would treat the 200 generations of humans who have left evidence of their life and work in our uplands with some respect. They mostly had a gentle and symbiotic relationship with nature, being part of it themselves. Their tangible relics are our cultural heritage, of equal importance to us as sentient thinking beings as the so-called natural heritage. Burning and grazing are essential to keep such heritage visible and accessible for the inspiration of present and future generations.

Until this is given equal weight with \u201cnatural capital\u201d, serious errors will continue to be made regarding management of national parks and other uplands.

      "bodyText": "Egyptian security forces have blocked access to Cairo\u2019s Tahrir Square, the highly symbolic focal point of the 2011 revolution, as part of a wide-ranging crackdown aimed at heading off planned protests against the president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi. Barricades and checkpoints on surrounding streets and the Qasr al-Nil Bridge diverted traffic on Friday afternoon, and three metro stations underneath the square were closed. Security officials stopped and searched pedestrians in the vicinity. The Sisi regime appeared to have been caught off guard last weekend when hundreds of protesters took to the streets in major towns and cities. Security forces responded with live fire and teargas. More than 2,000 people have since been detained, including high-profile activists who do not appear to have had any involvement in the protests, according to civil society groups. On Thursday the interior ministry made clear it intended to use force to quash any demonstrations on Friday. A resident of Warraq Island, a poor area of Cairo involved in a protracted uprising against a municipal development plan, said about 300 people had staged an anti-Sisi protest on Friday afternoon that had got broken up by police firing teargas and birdshot. Police also dispersed a protest involving 50-60 people in the southern Cairo district of Helwan. In southern Egypt, small-scale protests were staged in Qus and Qena city, witnesses told Agence France-Presse. In the port city of Suez, a man who took to the streets last weekend said a heightened military presence had dampened the prospect of fresh protests. \u201cI think the battle will be deferred to another time,\u201d he said. Sisi, who came to power in a coup in 2013, has overseen a wholesale crackdown on freedom of speech and public dissent, considered by observers to be the worst in Egypt\u2019s modern history. His expansion of a bloated security state has led to a rise in torture and police brutality that could constitute crimes against humanity, according to Human Rights Watch. An estimated 60,000 political prisoners languish in jail. Sisi attempted to project an image of business as usual in a rare interaction with the public when he greeted a crowd gathered to welcome him at Cairo airport as he returned from the UN general assembly in New York. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to wake up on a Friday, it\u2019s not worth it. Don\u2019t worry about anything,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat happened before will not happen again.\u201d Pro-regime gatherings took place in Cairo\u2019s middle-class area of Nasser City and the northern port city of Alexandria. \u201cPeople are demonstrating their love and support for their leader, their army, and their country,\u201d said Ahmed Mohammed, a member of the Future of a Nation political party, set up to support Sisi. \u201cThis is just the beginning. It\u2019s a celebratory environment to counter the terrorist call to protest against the president and his achievements.\u201d Last week\u2019s rare protests were sparked by a series of social media videos posted by Mohamed Ali, a former military contractor living in self-imposed exile in Barcelona who called for a million Egyptians to march on Friday. Ali has alleged that the Egyptian military squandered public funds to build palaces and luxury hotels, including opulent palaces for the president. Sisi later denied the claim, calling them \u201clies and slander\u201d. \u201cOf course I have built presidential palaces, and I will build presidential palaces,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they are not for me, they are for Egypt.\u201d The loud wail of police sirens could be heard throughout Friday over Tahrir Square, a vital intersection in central Cairo that was the centre of protests that overthrew Hosni Mubarak in 2011, and the gathering point for demonstrations against the late former Islamist leader Mohamed Morsi in 2012 and 2013.

Marturano completed an MBA through The Open University (OU) before setting up his own business. He recruited two OU virtual interns, Lily Beach (online marketing and customer relations officer) and Helen Wood (business development officer), via its online vacancy service, OpportunityHub. They\u2019re both now full-time members of staff.</p> <p><strong>How did you hear about the OU?<br></strong>Marturano: I did my MBA through the OU because I didn\u2019t have the resources to stop work and go to university full-time. I knew all about OpportunityHub and the ways in which it connects OU students and alumni with career opportunities.</p> <p><strong>As an employer, what made you recruit via the OU?<br></strong>Marturano: Having started my own business, my first thought \u2013 when the time came to hire people and think about expanding \u2013 was the OU. It was an obvious choice because I know that OU students and graduates have a similar mindset to me \u2013 we share a commitment to learning and bettering ourselves, and have the resourcefulness to study at the same time as working. That lends itself well to the demands of growing a business.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"395715704baa0d81ac8f95de55e995594c2dd9b9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/395715704baa0d81ac8f95de55e995594c2dd9b9/373_945_3530_4412/800.jpg\" alt=\"Lily Beach.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lily Beach.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amit Lennon/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"7faf0ae508f71d2b42b549912153517b8b6fd7d8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7faf0ae508f71d2b42b549912153517b8b6fd7d8/0_2_852_1065/800.jpg\" alt=\"Quote: 'I hope to continue to develop my skillset and have completed my degree'\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Lily Beach</p></li> </ul> <p><strong>How did you find Helen and Lily?<br></strong>Marturano: I contacted the OU via OpportunityHub and they put me in touch with several candidates. Helen and Lily were by far the best fit.</p> <p><strong>How easy was it to find the right people?<br></strong>Marturano: It was completely seamless and easy. The OU were fantastic and made it very simple to find the right candidates. They actually did most of the work for us. They took care of everything from collating CVs to contacting candidates. They even put the job advert together.</p> <p><strong>How did the OU compare with other agencies?<br></strong>Marturano: I did work with a couple of other recruitment agencies too and they weren\u2019t nearly as helpful.</p> <p><strong>Were you surprised by the calibre of candidates?<br></strong>Marturano: I\u2019ll be honest, no. I knew the OU would unearth people with impressive skills and the mindset to succeed. What <em>has</em> surprised me is the fact that I went to the OU as a means to an end \u2013 I needed an MBA to progress in my career when I was offered a directorship \u2013 but I ended up with the team to start and scale my own business!</p> <p><strong>Do you have any advice for other employers?<br></strong>Marturano: Think about what you want from an employee and particularly how you want them to help grow and sustain your business. OU students and graduates don\u2019t want to be average employees \u2013 they have the skills and tenacity to become an integral part of your business.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"a441e2a3ae55d65c01d22f59bef574709cc45bdd\"> <img src=\"https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2019/09/19/OpenUni_Article5-6_Helen_Wood-_quote_.jpg\" alt=\"Quote: 'I'm really enjoying watching the business grow and helping to develop it'\" width=\"852\" height=\"1076\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"02dd85cf3ecfa9f5e695b03616a98659e3eabd47\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/02dd85cf3ecfa9f5e695b03616a98659e3eabd47/251_756_3099_3874/800.jpg\" alt=\"Helen Wood.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Helen Wood.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jo Hanley/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Helen Wood</p></li> </ul> <p><strong>How did you find the position?<br></strong>Wood: I joined the OU to do a maths degree and I spent a lot of time on the OpportunityHub looking at jobs and seeing what openings were out there. I came across Claudio\u2019s advert and thought the idea of a virtual internship sounded really interesting. I applied and came onboard as a virtual intern for six weeks. After that, I was delighted when Claudio offered me a full-time job.</p> <p>Beach: When I started international studies with the OU, I immediately began looking for jobs as I\u2019d always planned to work alongside studying for my degree. The online internship seemed perfect for me because you can fit your working hours around your other studies and commitments.</p> <p><strong>What do you do?<br></strong>Wood: I work in business development, looking after the sales and finance side of things. I\u2019m also involved in deciding what direction the business will go in the future.</p> <p>Beach: I\u2019m responsible for marketing and branding.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s your favourite thing about working?<br></strong>Wood: I\u2019m in my final year of my degree so I\u2019m working full-time alongside studying, and I enjoy that.

      "bodyText": "Claudio Marturano runs Nubis Aviation Training, a compliance training and support platform for the aviation industry. Marturano completed an MBA through The Open University (OU) before setting up his own business. He recruited two OU virtual interns, Lily Beach (online marketing and customer relations officer) and Helen Wood (business development officer), via its online vacancy service, OpportunityHub. They\u2019re both now full-time members of staff. How did you hear about the OU? Marturano: I did my MBA through the OU because I didn\u2019t have the resources to stop work and go to university full-time. I knew all about OpportunityHub and the ways in which it connects OU students and alumni with career opportunities. As an employer, what made you recruit via the OU? Marturano: Having started my own business, my first thought \u2013 when the time came to hire people and think about expanding \u2013 was the OU. It was an obvious choice because I know that OU students and graduates have a similar mindset to me \u2013 we share a commitment to learning and bettering ourselves, and have the resourcefulness to study at the same time as working. That lends itself well to the demands of growing a business. Lily Beach How did you find Helen and Lily? Marturano: I contacted the OU via OpportunityHub and they put me in touch with several candidates. Helen and Lily were by far the best fit. How easy was it to find the right people? Marturano: It was completely seamless and easy. The OU were fantastic and made it very simple to find the right candidates. They actually did most of the work for us. They took care of everything from collating CVs to contacting candidates. They even put the job advert together. How did the OU compare with other agencies? Marturano: I did work with a couple of other recruitment agencies too and they weren\u2019t nearly as helpful. Were you surprised by the calibre of candidates? Marturano: I\u2019ll be honest, no. I knew the OU would unearth people with impressive skills and the mindset to succeed. What has surprised me is the fact that I went to the OU as a means to an end \u2013 I needed an MBA to progress in my career when I was offered a directorship \u2013 but I ended up with the team to start and scale my own business! Do you have any advice for other employers? Marturano: Think about what you want from an employee and particularly how you want them to help grow and sustain your business. OU students and graduates don\u2019t want to be average employees \u2013 they have the skills and tenacity to become an integral part of your business. Helen Wood How did you find the position? Wood: I joined the OU to do a maths degree and I spent a lot of time on the OpportunityHub looking at jobs and seeing what openings were out there. I came across Claudio\u2019s advert and thought the idea of a virtual internship sounded really interesting. I applied and came onboard as a virtual intern for six weeks. After that, I was delighted when Claudio offered me a full-time job. Beach: When I started international studies with the OU, I immediately began looking for jobs as I\u2019d always planned to work alongside studying for my degree. The online internship seemed perfect for me because you can fit your working hours around your other studies and commitments. What do you do? Wood: I work in business development, looking after the sales and finance side of things. I\u2019m also involved in deciding what direction the business will go in the future. Beach: I\u2019m responsible for marketing and branding. What\u2019s your favourite thing about working? Wood: I\u2019m in my final year of my degree so I\u2019m working full-time alongside studying, and I enjoy that. I also really like having had the opportunity to join the business from the very early stages of its development. It\u2019s been an invaluable experience. Beach: I enjoy the fact that I can bring the skills I am learning through my studies to my working environment. It\u2019s great to have this opportunity through the OU to work alongside studying, gaining and developing vital work experience to use for the future and in any professional setting. Claudio Marturano What have Lily and Helen brought to your business? Marturano: They have literally helped build the company from scratch. They were very eager and wanted to achieve from the get-go. Within six weeks, we had made a lot of progress and I realised very quickly they would be of real benefit to the business. Soon after they joined, they helped design an infrastructure for our working environment, which brought us from startup to being ready to scale. So together they\u2019ve been a dream team? Marturano: So far, so good, yes! Any challenges? Beach: One thing we initially found a little bit of a challenge was communication, but since then we\u2019ve developed our own communication system and way of sharing new information and keeping track of everything we need to work effectively, from project management to workflow. Marturano: It\u2019s not without its difficulties; you\u2019re doing something brand new and working with people you\u2019ve never met before. But aviation is not a nine-to-five job; you have to work in different time zones and I travel a lot, so having a virtual team that I can communicate with from everywhere has been invaluable. Hang on \u2013 you\u2019ve never met your staff? Marturano: We\u2019ve met twice since December, but I didn\u2019t meet Helen or Lily until more than a month after they joined the team. The nature of a virtual internship meant I didn\u2019t need to! And I actually think that\u2019s one of the key advantages of a virtual internship; aside from the fact that it keeps overheads low from an economic point of view, it also means you\u2019re not forced in front of each other just because you work together. Where do you see yourself in five years\u2019 time? Beach: I am enjoying learning about the business, particularly the aviation industry and contributing towards the growth of the company. We recently launched the official website and I am looking forward to attending events and talking about the products. Although it is difficult to say where I\u2019ll be in five years, I hope to continue to develop my skillset and have completed my degree. Wood: I\u2019m really enjoying watching the business grow and helping to develop it. I\u2019m not quite sure where I\u2019ll be in five years\u2019 time. I haven\u2019t planned that far ahead. I am taking one thing at a time, finishing my degree and learning more about the business. Marturano: As an employer it\u2019s wonderful to hear your team say that. They\u2019re already an integral part of the business but that they want to help grow it \u2013 well, I couldn\u2019t ask for anything more. In five years\u2019 time, I\u2019d like us to be a sustainable business with lots more people onboard; the go-to for support and training for the aviation industry.",

We\u2019re the poor cousins in that environment, so we realised a couple of years ago that we needed to be far more creative, both in how we approach that market, and in terms of the types of people we hire.

I knew that we were going to hire her 10 minutes into her interview'\" width=\"852\" height=\"1076\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Why the OU?<br></strong>We wanted to find people who had perhaps come into education late and who had already experienced the world of work. Our clients are very serious blue chip firms and they expect the type of people we provide for their projects to be similarly capable and professional \u2013 mature individuals with good communication skills.</p> <p><strong>How did you go about engaging with the OU?<br></strong>We contacted the OU and said there was the chance of a student placement with us, almost like a \u201ctry before you buy\u201d type of approach.</p> <p><strong>What was the recruitment process like?<br></strong>We see the recruitment process as being a two-way thing; we are looking for good candidates who match all our criteria, but, equally, the work we do is highly technical and very demanding, and it doesn\u2019t suit everybody. Our contact at the OU is very adept at getting across all the different ways that we can interact with the OU. She is a force of nature and having someone so driven on the OU side has really helped. It was nothing like the typical student recruitment fair process; it was much more of a bespoke service. She really invested time in understanding our business and the skills required to undertake the role to ensure the student\u2019s on a particular course specialism were informed of the opportunity.</p> <p><strong>How did the interview go?<br></strong>I was very impressed by Shauna\u2019s story. I knew that we were going to hire her 10 minutes into her interview.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s she been like to work with?<br></strong>Shauna has already taken on significant responsibility within the business. She\u2019s been involved in a project over the past 12 months that has taken her all around the UK. And she\u2019s studying at the same time; I think a person\u2019s ability to balance work with study is a signal about their maturity and therefore their motivation. Generally speaking, OU students share those qualities. We\u2019re seeing people of that calibre.</p> <p><strong>Where do you see the business a year from now?<br></strong>We are growing pretty quickly, so we plan to hire another 10 to 20 people in the next year. We\u2019ll continue to be very internationally focused.</p> <p><strong>And beyond that?<br></strong>We want to continue building the relationship we have with the OU. There is an established assumption that you must go to a \u201cgood\u201d school and get \u201cgood\u201d exam results and then attend a \u201cgood\u201d university before embarking on a career with the likes of a big four consulting firm, but that just does not fit the way that some of the best and brightest minds find their way into the world of work. The OU has given us an inside track into a population of extremely hardworking, intelligent people who, for whatever reason, are not conforming to that pattern. The challenge remains as to how we, as a relatively small firm without a really strong identity in the recruitment marketplace, can engage with talent that is in short supply. The OU will continue to play a very important role for us in terms of that talent pipeline.</p> <h2>Shauna Corr on becoming a data engineer</h2> <p><strong>What were you doing before working for Datactics?<br></strong>I did IT at GCSE level and I went to Belfast Met to do my A-levels but I found it very boring, so I took a gap year and started working in retail. I worked my way up to management level but I knew it wasn\u2019t for me, so I decided to go back to education. I tried a traditional redbrick university, but working full-time and travelling across town at rush hour to get to classes was impractical. You\u2019re sitting in a huge lecture hall with 200 people and you don\u2019t have a chance to make a connection with them because you\u2019re working. I knew I wasn\u2019t on the right path.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"dc2a25da845f88ac1ec2aa35564f91a550ff77e7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc2a25da845f88ac1ec2aa35564f91a550ff77e7/0_5_852_1065/800.jpg\" alt=\"Quote: 'I am hoping to become a senior data engineer within the next five years'\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"9c3a2f9773a9cde6829ea36759e39239b6b8bfc4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9c3a2f9773a9cde6829ea36759e39239b6b8bfc4/681_605_3475_4344/800.jpg\" alt=\"Shauna Corr.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shauna Corr.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Elaine Hill/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>How did you engage with the OU?<br></strong>I\u2019d heard about the OU from a friend. The fact that you can study in your own time and that you don\u2019t have to travel anywhere made it really appealing to me. I wanted to study something fun, so I looked at the course descriptions and settled on a short course in programming, initially. It was a lot of fun; writing some code and seeing what came out on screen was really amazing to me. From there, I enrolled on the BSc (Hons) computing and IT course.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/diverse-talent-everywhere/2019/sep/27/virtual-path-how-an-aviation-training-startup-got-onboard-with-remote-internships\">Virtual path: how an aviation training startup got onboard with remote internships</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>How did you connect with Datactics?<br></strong>I was still working in my old job at the time, but I saw the Datactics work placement advert in an email I\u2019d signed up to receive from the OU careers contact.

The challenge remains as to how we, as a relatively small firm without a really strong identity in the recruitment marketplace, can engage with talent that is in short supply. The OU will continue to play a very important role for us in terms of that talent pipeline. Shauna Corr on becoming a data engineer What were you doing before working for Datactics? I did IT at GCSE level and I went to Belfast Met to do my A-levels but I found it very boring, so I took a gap year and started working in retail. I worked my way up to management level but I knew it wasn\u2019t for me, so I decided to go back to education. I tried a traditional redbrick university, but working full-time and travelling across town at rush hour to get to classes was impractical. You\u2019re sitting in a huge lecture hall with 200 people and you don\u2019t have a chance to make a connection with them because you\u2019re working. I knew I wasn\u2019t on the right path. How did you engage with the OU? I\u2019d heard about the OU from a friend. The fact that you can study in your own time and that you don\u2019t have to travel anywhere made it really appealing to me. I wanted to study something fun, so I looked at the course descriptions and settled on a short course in programming, initially. It was a lot of fun; writing some code and seeing what came out on screen was really amazing to me. From there, I enrolled on the BSc (Hons) computing and IT course. How did you connect with Datactics? I was still working in my old job at the time, but I saw the Datactics work placement advert in an email I\u2019d signed up to receive from the OU careers contact. She helped me work on my CV to apply for the post and even helped me to prepare for the interview. How did it go? It worked out very well. It was the most casual interview I\u2019ve ever had! I was hired for a year initially but I was promoted to permanent staff within six months. I\u2019m still studying with the OU at the same time as working full-time, but I only have one more module to go. How is the job going? Great. I\u2019ve been enjoying a project that involves a tour of the UK\u2019s cities for the past year. Where do you see yourself in five years\u2019 time? I am hoping to become a senior data engineer within the next five years. Beyond that I\u2019m not sure, but I think I\u2019m well suited to the business. I have no plans to leave. \u2022 This article was amended on 7 October to clarify the description of the recruitment process",

Consider the case of the man accused of driving a van into pedestrians in Toronto last year, killing 10 people, who warned in a <a href=\"https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/toronto-van-attack-police-interview\" title=\"\">police video </a>(released on Friday) that he\u2019d start an incel uprising with it all. Nine days \u2013 nine days! \u2013 after that mass murder, I read an extremely serious column in the New York Times that used the event to discuss the \u201credistribution of sex\u201d. As its author put it: \u201cSometimes the extremists and radicals and weirdos see the world more clearly than the respectable and moderate and sane.\u201d</p> <p>Well, it was an admiring \u201cwow\u201d from me. Men\u2019s rights is <em>wild</em>. These guys really get stuff done. Women have been fannying about for decades asking peacefully for their rights, and we still can\u2019t be in charge of our own bodies. Ten people get killed, and before the fortnight\u2019s out there\u2019s a chinstroker in the world\u2019s leading liberal newspaper wondering how we can address the needs and concerns of the suspect.</p> <p>Like Cummings, the \u201cbig thinkers\u201d who pander to these instincts are never going to be the ones getting hurt. Just as the guy who wrote that New York Times op-ed truly has my blessing to go and wank off whatever inadequates he likes as a public service to stop male terrorism or something, I suspect he thinks it\u2019s a job for ladies. Not his problem. He\u2019s thunked the thinkpiece, and it\u2019s up to the patsies to enact it.</p> <p>There is so much of this to Cummings\u2019 \u201cpeople vs parliament\u201d brand of politics, but the patsies \u2013 the Tory MPs \u2013 are yet to catch on. While most women could read that New York Times column and work out what it basically meant for them, a lot of Conservative MPs are dutifully spouting Cummings\u2019 lines, but don\u2019t yet seem to have worked out where they leave them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"47b32bb0de1c485a57d3a3778ddd286ca5e1bcc3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/47b32bb0de1c485a57d3a3778ddd286ca5e1bcc3/40_43_3431_2059/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson speaking in parliament.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson speaking in parliament.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters Tv/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But listen, Tory mooks \u2013 I\u2019m here to help. While you\u2019re getting a <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2017/08/12/us/white-nationalists-tiki-torch-march-trnd/index.html\" title=\"\">tiki torch</a> and standing a post, let me tell you what a \u201cpeople vs parliament\u201d election ultimately means for you. First, if you whip up an angry mob, why do you assume they won\u2019t end up angry with you? Do you think the mob is going to come upon an MP and go, \u201cWait, wait \u2013 this is so-and-so. He voted for Meaningful Votes 2 and 3, so we should, you know, definitely not put our pitchforks up his arse\u201d? Eventually, you\u2019re going to get a pitchfork up your arse either way.</p> <p>To adapt that phrase of the alt-right to whom you tack closer every day: mobs don\u2019t care about your feelings. If I had to come up with an adjective to help you understand mobs, it would probably be mob-like. Very mobby. Mobtastic. If you go to the country in a people v parliament election, you may indeed get elected and be part of a triumphant Tory majority. But when you have been elected, and when you\u2019ve \u201cgot Brexit done\u201d \u2013 which is to say, when you\u2019ve either taken the UK off the no-deal cliff, or opened up the next however many painful years of trade negotiations fuckery-pokery, which is never going to solve the problems it is magically supposed to \u2013 you, then, are \u201cparliament\u201d.</p> <p>The even angrier people are then versus YOU. That\u2019s when they come for you, because you asked them to. You invited them in. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever heard this line \u201cthe revolution devours its children\u201d? That\u2019s you, babe. Second, I know you\u2019ve already only read about one war, but bad news: it\u2019s the wrong war. You need the first world war, not the second. By way of a crash course of what Dom\u2019s got planned for you, take the line in Blackadder, where the general brays to the guys he\u2019s sending over the top: \u201cWe\u2019ll be right behind you!\u201d and Blackadder mutters: \u201cAbout 35 miles behind you.\u201d You\u2019re the cannon fodder, you\u2019re the <a href=\"https://blackadder.fandom.com/wiki/Twenty_Minuters\" title=\"\">Twenty Minuters</a>.

He hates the Conservative party. He believes he\u2019s surrounded by idiots. Again: that\u2019s you, babe.</p> <p>What\u2019s amazing, given he\u2019s written all of this stuff down, and at length, is the selective deafness of the Tories going along with it. They hear the stuff Dom is saying about things being swept away. But they don\u2019t hear the bits that will eventually mean them.</p> <p>Consider the irony of the European Research Group currently obeying a man who described them as a \u201cnarcissist-delusional subset\u201d, adding: \u201cYou should be treated like a metastasising tumour and excised from the UK body politic.\u201d It\u2019s not a hugely opaque statement.</p> <p>More moderate Conservatives should realise where they\u2019re travelling with this stuff.

Consider the case of the man accused of driving a van into pedestrians in Toronto last year, killing 10 people, who warned in a police video (released on Friday) that he\u2019d start an incel uprising with it all. Nine days \u2013 nine days! \u2013 after that mass murder, I read an extremely serious column in the New York Times that used the event to discuss the \u201credistribution of sex\u201d. As its author put it: \u201cSometimes the extremists and radicals and weirdos see the world more clearly than the respectable and moderate and sane.\u201d Well, it was an admiring \u201cwow\u201d from me. Men\u2019s rights is wild. These guys really get stuff done. Women have been fannying about for decades asking peacefully for their rights, and we still can\u2019t be in charge of our own bodies. Ten people get killed, and before the fortnight\u2019s out there\u2019s a chinstroker in the world\u2019s leading liberal newspaper wondering how we can address the needs and concerns of the suspect. Like Cummings, the \u201cbig thinkers\u201d who pander to these instincts are never going to be the ones getting hurt. Just as the guy who wrote that New York Times op-ed truly has my blessing to go and wank off whatever inadequates he likes as a public service to stop male terrorism or something, I suspect he thinks it\u2019s a job for ladies. Not his problem. He\u2019s thunked the thinkpiece, and it\u2019s up to the patsies to enact it. There is so much of this to Cummings\u2019 \u201cpeople vs parliament\u201d brand of politics, but the patsies \u2013 the Tory MPs \u2013 are yet to catch on. While most women could read that New York Times column and work out what it basically meant for them, a lot of Conservative MPs are dutifully spouting Cummings\u2019 lines, but don\u2019t yet seem to have worked out where they leave them. But listen, Tory mooks \u2013 I\u2019m here to help. While you\u2019re getting a tiki torch and standing a post, let me tell you what a \u201cpeople vs parliament\u201d election ultimately means for you. First, if you whip up an angry mob, why do you assume they won\u2019t end up angry with you? Do you think the mob is going to come upon an MP and go, \u201cWait, wait \u2013 this is so-and-so. He voted for Meaningful Votes 2 and 3, so we should, you know, definitely not put our pitchforks up his arse\u201d? Eventually, you\u2019re going to get a pitchfork up your arse either way. To adapt that phrase of the alt-right to whom you tack closer every day: mobs don\u2019t care about your feelings. If I had to come up with an adjective to help you understand mobs, it would probably be mob-like. Very mobby. Mobtastic. If you go to the country in a people v parliament election, you may indeed get elected and be part of a triumphant Tory majority. But when you have been elected, and when you\u2019ve \u201cgot Brexit done\u201d \u2013 which is to say, when you\u2019ve either taken the UK off the no-deal cliff, or opened up the next however many painful years of trade negotiations fuckery-pokery, which is never going to solve the problems it is magically supposed to \u2013 you, then, are \u201cparliament\u201d. The even angrier people are then versus YOU. That\u2019s when they come for you, because you asked them to. You invited them in. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever heard this line \u201cthe revolution devours its children\u201d? That\u2019s you, babe. Second, I know you\u2019ve already only read about one war, but bad news: it\u2019s the wrong war. You need the first world war, not the second. By way of a crash course of what Dom\u2019s got planned for you, take the line in Blackadder, where the general brays to the guys he\u2019s sending over the top: \u201cWe\u2019ll be right behind you!\u201d and Blackadder mutters: \u201cAbout 35 miles behind you.\u201d You\u2019re the cannon fodder, you\u2019re the Twenty Minuters. But, hey \u2013 enjoy it out there. Third, as is blindingly obvious to everyone else, Cummings is one of those masterminds who hates his henchmen. He hates the Conservative party. He believes he\u2019s surrounded by idiots. Again: that\u2019s you, babe. What\u2019s amazing, given he\u2019s written all of this stuff down, and at length, is the selective deafness of the Tories going along with it. They hear the stuff Dom is saying about things being swept away. But they don\u2019t hear the bits that will eventually mean them. Consider the irony of the European Research Group currently obeying a man who described them as a \u201cnarcissist-delusional subset\u201d, adding: \u201cYou should be treated like a metastasising tumour and excised from the UK body politic.\u201d It\u2019s not a hugely opaque statement. More moderate Conservatives should realise where they\u2019re travelling with this stuff. Some people just want to watch your bit of the world burn. You bow to them at your peril \u2013 and ours. \u2022 Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist",

Born Mort, the character had married Light\u2019s Shelly and fathered three children before revealing her gender identity and beginning her transition. Considered groundbreaking for its portrayal of the trans community and its championing of transgender actors and writers, Transparent made other, stickier headlines when an actress on the show and a former assistant both accused Tambor of sexual harassment. Tambor\u2019s option was not renewed. He denies the allegations.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s so difficult to talk about,\u201d Light says, when asked about making the finale without Tambor\u2019s Maura. \u201cThere is still sorrow. And there is difficulty. And it\u2019s still \u2013 it\u2019s hard to talk about,\u201d she says. I ask about her work with Tambor, whose performance she had praised before the allegations surfaced. \u201cIt really is difficult to talk about,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I\u2019m \u2013 I wish I could, I wish I could, I just \u2013 I hope you understand.\u201d And when Light looks at you \u2013 with her radiance, with the full force of her attention \u2013 yes, you understand. Or at least you stop asking. </p> <p>Maura\u2019s absence, courtesy of a convenient aortic aneurysm, meant that some else has to step into the spotlight. That someone is Light\u2019s Shelly, a needy, meddling, achingly vulnerable Jewish mother, part of what Soloway calls \u201ca forgotten generation of women who always feel like they\u2019re waiting for their turn\u201d. In the finale, Shelly takes it, which means that Light sings, she dances, she laughs, she cries, she gyrates in a flesh-coloured leotard and belts lyrics about shoving her grown children back into her vagina. And she inaugurates, to quote one of Faith Soloway\u2019s envelope-pushing lyrics, \u201ca joyocaust / For all the lives we\u2019ve lost.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"64746cffadbd23d8f601a0c06ca4143efa5498fc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/64746cffadbd23d8f601a0c06ca4143efa5498fc/0_148_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018So flexible\u2019 \u2026 Light in Ugly Betty.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018So flexible\u2019 \u2026 Light in Ugly Betty.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karen Neal/Walt Disney Television via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Light hasn\u2019t performed in many musicals. The last one she did, Company, terrified her. She speaks of the Transparent musical as \u201ca glorious creation\u201d, praising her co-workers and somehow minimising her own efforts. Soloway isn\u2019t so reticent. \u201cShe killed it,\u201d Soloway says. \u201cShe\u2019s like dancing her ass off and never tired. She never needed a break. We were just like, \u2018What is she on?\u2019 Can I please be that way when I\u2019m 70? So flexible, so funny, so sexy.\u201d</p> <p>Light believes that actors are \u201cinvestigative reporters, psychological investigative reporters\u201d, and that acting is a service profession. She will sometimes conduct research into times, places, circumstances, accents. Shelly didn\u2019t require much. Rather, the part meant giving voice and making space for a character she calls \u201cso messy, and so all over the place, like an octopus with flailing arms\u201d, and layering in the fragility and the vulnerability beneath all that flailing. Light felt for Shelly and allowed an audience to feel for her, too. \u201cThat\u2019s the greatest gift that an artist can give,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Early in her career, she made more ego-driven choices, she says. \u201cIt was about me, about what was I gonna get?\u201d she says. There\u2019s nothing to get in life, there\u2019s only what you give.\u201d She doesn\u2019t mean it in a saintly way, she says. That\u2019s just how it is. \u201cIt\u2019s like, give it all away! Give!\u201d</p> <p>Her activism, which she began in the 80s after filming a TV movie about Ryan White, an early Aids victim, is another kind of giving. Does she see a relationship between her advocacy and her acting? Light says that she doesn\u2019t, at least not a conscious one. \u201cI don\u2019t think about it,\u201d she says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dacc264b693b2a48ace6b7afb9962c9951430812\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dacc264b693b2a48ace6b7afb9962c9951430812/0_348_3000_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Light in 80s sitcom Who\u2019s the Boss?\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sitcom star \u2026 Light with Tony Danza in 80s sitcom Who\u2019s the Boss?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Craig Sjodin/Walt Disney Television via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But her activism is based on the idea, as Light explains, that \u201cwe\u2019re all of one family, we\u2019re all human beings, we all can relate to each other in a way that is respectful and compassionate and honouring someone\u2019s choice of who they know they are.\u201d And she now chooses her acting projects with an eye to which roles might make a difference, spark conversation, sound an alarm, help us to see each other and our world more clearly and more kindly. Which are different, but not dissimilar ways of incarnating a better, kinder world and more authentic relationships.</p> <p>These days, her authenticity involves mostly living in New York while her husband mostly lives in Los Angeles, though they visit each other often. It\u2019s an arrangement they began while Light was filming Ugly Betty, and she is happy to proselytise. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting,\u201d she says. It\u2019s vital. It\u2019s independent, it is not co-dependent. We both love our alone time. Not everybody can do this, because you have to love your alone time, you really do.\u201d Even the cat, who lives in Los Angeles, seems to understand.</p> <p>At the beginning of her career, when she thought that taking a soap opera would demean her, when she thought that sitcoms weren\u2019t where serious actors belonged, she didn\u2019t imagine that at 70 she would be offered a life and an art that was so rich. That owes in part to an industry that is changing, however slowly, and now sees women over 40 as more than, as Light says, \u201cthe nutty grandma, or the kooky sister-in-law, or the bitchy head of the agency who had two episodes. It is not like that any more.\u201d It also owes to women like Light and her peers insisting they are just as interesting and deserving of attention as anyone else.</p> <p>Just before she leaves, Light quotes Helen Keller: \u201c\u2018Life is either a daring adventure or it\u2019s nothing.\u2019 That\u2019s the way I hold my life,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd within that is tremendous freedom. Doesn\u2019t mean that fear doesn\u2019t come up, doesn\u2019t mean that all things work out the way you think you want them to. But it surely is a journey, an adventure, an aliveness that I would ever have expected.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Transparent: Musicale Finale is on Amazon Prime now.</p>",

In the finale, Shelly takes it, which means that Light sings, she dances, she laughs, she cries, she gyrates in a flesh-coloured leotard and belts lyrics about shoving her grown children back into her vagina. And she inaugurates, to quote one of Faith Soloway\u2019s envelope-pushing lyrics, \u201ca joyocaust / For all the lives we\u2019ve lost.\u201d Light hasn\u2019t performed in many musicals. The last one she did, Company, terrified her. She speaks of the Transparent musical as \u201ca glorious creation\u201d, praising her co-workers and somehow minimising her own efforts. Soloway isn\u2019t so reticent. \u201cShe killed it,\u201d Soloway says. \u201cShe\u2019s like dancing her ass off and never tired. She never needed a break. We were just like, \u2018What is she on?\u2019 Can I please be that way when I\u2019m 70? So flexible, so funny, so sexy.\u201d Light believes that actors are \u201cinvestigative reporters, psychological investigative reporters\u201d, and that acting is a service profession. She will sometimes conduct research into times, places, circumstances, accents. Shelly didn\u2019t require much. Rather, the part meant giving voice and making space for a character she calls \u201cso messy, and so all over the place, like an octopus with flailing arms\u201d, and layering in the fragility and the vulnerability beneath all that flailing. Light felt for Shelly and allowed an audience to feel for her, too. \u201cThat\u2019s the greatest gift that an artist can give,\u201d she says. Early in her career, she made more ego-driven choices, she says. \u201cIt was about me, about what was I gonna get?\u201d she says. There\u2019s nothing to get in life, there\u2019s only what you give.\u201d She doesn\u2019t mean it in a saintly way, she says. That\u2019s just how it is. \u201cIt\u2019s like, give it all away! Give!\u201d Her activism, which she began in the 80s after filming a TV movie about Ryan White, an early Aids victim, is another kind of giving. Does she see a relationship between her advocacy and her acting? Light says that she doesn\u2019t, at least not a conscious one. \u201cI don\u2019t think about it,\u201d she says. But her activism is based on the idea, as Light explains, that \u201cwe\u2019re all of one family, we\u2019re all human beings, we all can relate to each other in a way that is respectful and compassionate and honouring someone\u2019s choice of who they know they are.\u201d And she now chooses her acting projects with an eye to which roles might make a difference, spark conversation, sound an alarm, help us to see each other and our world more clearly and more kindly. Which are different, but not dissimilar ways of incarnating a better, kinder world and more authentic relationships. These days, her authenticity involves mostly living in New York while her husband mostly lives in Los Angeles, though they visit each other often. It\u2019s an arrangement they began while Light was filming Ugly Betty, and she is happy to proselytise. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting,\u201d she says. It\u2019s vital. It\u2019s independent, it is not co-dependent. We both love our alone time. Not everybody can do this, because you have to love your alone time, you really do.\u201d Even the cat, who lives in Los Angeles, seems to understand. At the beginning of her career, when she thought that taking a soap opera would demean her, when she thought that sitcoms weren\u2019t where serious actors belonged, she didn\u2019t imagine that at 70 she would be offered a life and an art that was so rich. That owes in part to an industry that is changing, however slowly, and now sees women over 40 as more than, as Light says, \u201cthe nutty grandma, or the kooky sister-in-law, or the bitchy head of the agency who had two episodes. It is not like that any more.\u201d It also owes to women like Light and her peers insisting they are just as interesting and deserving of attention as anyone else. Just before she leaves, Light quotes Helen Keller: \u201c\u2018Life is either a daring adventure or it\u2019s nothing.\u2019 That\u2019s the way I hold my life,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd within that is tremendous freedom. Doesn\u2019t mean that fear doesn\u2019t come up, doesn\u2019t mean that all things work out the way you think you want them to. But it surely is a journey, an adventure, an aliveness that I would ever have expected.\u201d \u2022 Transparent: Musicale Finale is on Amazon Prime now.",

      "body": "<p>Although the Grateful Dead enjoyed a reputation for lengthy musical improvisations, their career was based on a solid core of songwriting craft. Robert Hunter, who has died aged 78, wrote the lyrics for many of their best-loved songs, and his work was vital in developing the mystique that earned the American band an extended international family of loyal followers, the so-called Deadheads.</p> <p>A list of the songs that bear Hunter\u2019s byline amounts to a road map of the Grateful Dead\u2019s career. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QV-2EJnfzjY\" title=\"\">Dark Star</a> (1968) and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xa8ImA_wSKI\" title=\"\">St Stephen</a> (1969) were emblematic of their psychedelic beginnings, while <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pafY6sZt0FE\" title=\"\">Truckin\u2019</a> (1970), <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qe6sJMjy4T0\" title=\"\">Playing in the Band</a> (1971) and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSIajKGHZRk\" title=\"\">Uncle John\u2019s Band</a> (1970) were imaginatively embroidered chunks of the Dead\u2019s autobiography. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XacvydVrhuI\" title=\"\">Friend of the Devil</a> (subsequently covered by countless other artists) had the feel of an old west fable, and like many other of their compositions tapped into the folk and blues roots that Hunter and the guitarist-songwriter <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/jerry-garcia-1942-1995-247179/\" title=\"\">Jerry Garcia</a> had grown up with. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYbRmSlW-M\" title=\"\">Touch of Grey</a> (with its trademark lines \u201cI will get by, I will survive\u201d) was an ode to the group\u2019s longevity and earned them their only Top 10 hit in the US in 1987.</p> <p>Although it is his work with the Dead for which he will be chiefly remembered, Hunter engaged in several other successful collaborations. An intermittent partnership with Bob Dylan began when he co-wrote the tracks Silvio and The Ugliest Girl in the World on Dylan\u2019s 1988 album Down in the Groove, and he later shared authorship of most of the songs on Together Through Life (2009) and collaborated on Duquesne Whistle from the album Tempest (2012).</p> <p>He also worked with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/apr/15/bruce-hornsby-interview-absolute-zero\" title=\"\">Bruce Hornsby</a> (who played keyboards with the Dead late in their career) and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/aug/18/worldmusic.shopping\" title=\"\">Los Lobos</a>. As Hornsby put it, after Hunter had written his song Cyclone (2009), \u201cI\u2019ve loved so many of the Garcia/Hunter songs.

I\u2019ve only heard from him once in 20 or 30 years.\u201d One of his earliest memories was his mother singing along to pop songs on the radio while she bathed him. He spent several years in foster homes before returning to live with his mother, who later married Norman Hunter, a publishing executive at McGraw-Hill, when Robert was 11.</p> <p>He had a band called the Presidents in Palo Alto high school, a Dixieland outfit in which he played trumpet. After a six-month stint in the army in 1959 (\u201cIt was an experience a lot of kids could probably benefit from,\u201d he said), he spent a year at the University of Connecticut where he played in a folk trio, then moved back to California. He first met Garcia through a mutual girlfriend, and in 1961 they briefly formed the duo <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW90bqBUBSs\" title=\"\">Bob and Jerry</a> as well as playing in several bluegrass bands together. They parted company as Garcia pursued his musical ambitions while Hunter concentrated on writing.</p> <p>In 1962 he volunteered to participate in a Stanford University programme testing psychedelic drugs (not realising this was run by the CIA), and was given LSD, mescaline and psilocybin. He considered that these experiences greatly boosted his writing skills, and he displayed a knack for expressing his altered state of mind. \u201cBy my faith, if this be insanity, then for the love of God permit me to be insane,\u201d he wrote on one occasion.</p> <p>However, a subsequent over-fondness for amphetamines prompted him to leave California for New Mexico, where he began writing song lyrics, including St Stephen, Alligator and China Cat Sunflower. He sent these to Garcia, who was sufficiently impressed to urge Hunter to come to San Francisco and become the lyricist for the fledgling Grateful Dead.</p> <p>Alligator appeared on the band\u2019s second album, Anthem of the Sun (1968), while the follow-up, Aoxomoxoa (1969), was almost totally written by Hunter and Garcia. Workingman\u2019s Dead and American Beauty (both 1970) found the group moving away from trippy experimentalism towards a more traditional, country-flavoured, Americana style, and between them added up to a trove of the Dead\u2019s finest songs, Cumberland Blues, Uncle John\u2019s Band, Casey Jones, Box of Rain, Friend of the Devil and Sugar Magnolia among them. American Beauty\u2019s Ripple was solely composed by Hunter, and contained what he claimed to Rolling Stone magazine to be his favourite of his own lines: \u201cLet it be known there is a fountain that was not made by the hands of man.\u201d</p> <p>Their working methods were elastic. Sometimes Hunter would listen to the band working on a new song and devise lyrics on the spot; sometimes he would listen to tapes of musical ideas and write lyrics to fit; or he would give the group lyrics that they would then build music around. \u201cWhat we were doing was almost sacred,\u201d he said in 2015. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel we were a pop music band.

      "bodyText": "Although the Grateful Dead enjoyed a reputation for lengthy musical improvisations, their career was based on a solid core of songwriting craft. Robert Hunter, who has died aged 78, wrote the lyrics for many of their best-loved songs, and his work was vital in developing the mystique that earned the American band an extended international family of loyal followers, the so-called Deadheads. A list of the songs that bear Hunter\u2019s byline amounts to a road map of the Grateful Dead\u2019s career. Dark Star (1968) and St Stephen (1969) were emblematic of their psychedelic beginnings, while Truckin\u2019 (1970), Playing in the Band (1971) and Uncle John\u2019s Band (1970) were imaginatively embroidered chunks of the Dead\u2019s autobiography. Friend of the Devil (subsequently covered by countless other artists) had the feel of an old west fable, and like many other of their compositions tapped into the folk and blues roots that Hunter and the guitarist-songwriter Jerry Garcia had grown up with. Touch of Grey (with its trademark lines \u201cI will get by, I will survive\u201d) was an ode to the group\u2019s longevity and earned them their only Top 10 hit in the US in 1987. Although it is his work with the Dead for which he will be chiefly remembered, Hunter engaged in several other successful collaborations. An intermittent partnership with Bob Dylan began when he co-wrote the tracks Silvio and The Ugliest Girl in the World on Dylan\u2019s 1988 album Down in the Groove, and he later shared authorship of most of the songs on Together Through Life (2009) and collaborated on Duquesne Whistle from the album Tempest (2012). He also worked with Bruce Hornsby (who played keyboards with the Dead late in their career) and Los Lobos. As Hornsby put it, after Hunter had written his song Cyclone (2009), \u201cI\u2019ve loved so many of the Garcia/Hunter songs. They\u2019re just timeless-sounding to me, could have been written hundreds of years ago.\u201d Hunter was born Robert Burns in Arroyo Grande, California, and later adopted his stepfather\u2019s surname. \u201cWhen I was nine my family split up,\u201d he revealed, claiming that his father \u201cwas an electrician, an itinerant kind of a goldminer, something like that ... I\u2019ve only heard from him once in 20 or 30 years.\u201d One of his earliest memories was his mother singing along to pop songs on the radio while she bathed him. He spent several years in foster homes before returning to live with his mother, who later married Norman Hunter, a publishing executive at McGraw-Hill, when Robert was 11. He had a band called the Presidents in Palo Alto high school, a Dixieland outfit in which he played trumpet. After a six-month stint in the army in 1959 (\u201cIt was an experience a lot of kids could probably benefit from,\u201d he said), he spent a year at the University of Connecticut where he played in a folk trio, then moved back to California. He first met Garcia through a mutual girlfriend, and in 1961 they briefly formed the duo Bob and Jerry as well as playing in several bluegrass bands together. They parted company as Garcia pursued his musical ambitions while Hunter concentrated on writing. In 1962 he volunteered to participate in a Stanford University programme testing psychedelic drugs (not realising this was run by the CIA), and was given LSD, mescaline and psilocybin. He considered that these experiences greatly boosted his writing skills, and he displayed a knack for expressing his altered state of mind. \u201cBy my faith, if this be insanity, then for the love of God permit me to be insane,\u201d he wrote on one occasion. However, a subsequent over-fondness for amphetamines prompted him to leave California for New Mexico, where he began writing song lyrics, including St Stephen, Alligator and China Cat Sunflower. He sent these to Garcia, who was sufficiently impressed to urge Hunter to come to San Francisco and become the lyricist for the fledgling Grateful Dead. Alligator appeared on the band\u2019s second album, Anthem of the Sun (1968), while the follow-up, Aoxomoxoa (1969), was almost totally written by Hunter and Garcia. Workingman\u2019s Dead and American Beauty (both 1970) found the group moving away from trippy experimentalism towards a more traditional, country-flavoured, Americana style, and between them added up to a trove of the Dead\u2019s finest songs, Cumberland Blues, Uncle John\u2019s Band, Casey Jones, Box of Rain, Friend of the Devil and Sugar Magnolia among them. American Beauty\u2019s Ripple was solely composed by Hunter, and contained what he claimed to Rolling Stone magazine to be his favourite of his own lines: \u201cLet it be known there is a fountain that was not made by the hands of man.\u201d Their working methods were elastic. Sometimes Hunter would listen to the band working on a new song and devise lyrics on the spot; sometimes he would listen to tapes of musical ideas and write lyrics to fit; or he would give the group lyrics that they would then build music around. \u201cWhat we were doing was almost sacred,\u201d he said in 2015. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel we were a pop music band. I wanted to write a whole different sort of music.\u201d His partnership with Garcia lasted right through to the Dead\u2019s final studio album, Built to Last (1989). Garcia died in 1995. \u201cI didn\u2019t get the feeling he intended to live very long,\u201d Hunter told Rolling Stone. \u201cThere are things about Jerry I just don\u2019t understand. Or maybe am not capable of knowing.\u201d Hunter also undertook collaborations with the songwriter Jim Lauderdale, with whom he wrote the album Patchwork River (2010), and the Dead\u2019s drummer Mickey Hart, contributing lyrics to the albums Mysterium Tremendum (2012) and Superorganism (2013). He co-wrote four songs with Bill Payne on Little Feat\u2019s album Rooster Rag (2012). Hunter performed in his own right occasionally, undertaking his final solo tour in 2013 in part to raise money to pay medical bills incurred during treatment for a spinal abscess. He recorded several solo albums, including Tales of the Great Rum Runners (1974), Tiger Rose (1975), Flight of the Marie Helena (a poem read against a musical backing, 1985) and Rock Columbia (1986). He also published several volumes of poetry, as well as two volumes of translations of the poems of Rilke. In 2013 he was given the lifetime achievement award of the Americana Music Association, and in 2015 Hunter and Garcia were inducted into the Songwriters\u2019 Hall of Fame. He is survived by his wife, Maureen, whom he married in 1982, and his children, Kate, Charlotte and Jess. \u2022 Robert Hunter, songwriter and musician, born 23 June 1941; died 23 September 2019",

From 2012-16 he had overhauled Saint Laurent, a project which more than doubled the brand\u2019s turnover, and redefined the role of the modern fashion designer. For Slimane, the clothes are only part of the story \u2013 he\u2019s responsible for everything, from photographing the advertising campaigns and designing the sets for his elaborate fashion shows, right down to look and paper quality of the shopping bags. Of course, this 360-degree approach includes designing Celine\u2019s stores. So far, remodelled branches in New York, LA, Tokyo, Milan and Paris have been unveiled, ranging from an imposing glass box in Madison Avenue to the flagship on Rue de Grenelle in Paris, a tactile temple of marble and reclaimed oak, with plinths and shelves that \u2013 thanks to LED lighting \u2013 seem to float just above the concrete floor.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"57febb9b9727044264faef59716f1a9dc5db13e5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/57febb9b9727044264faef59716f1a9dc5db13e5/447_1356_2436_3144/775.jpg\" alt=\"Hedi Slimane, whose ultimate aim is to uncover new talent and create a community with shared attitudes and aesthetic values.\" width=\"775\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hedi Slimane, whose ultimate aim is to uncover new talent and create a community with shared attitudes and aesthetic values.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Y.

He has decided where all the artworks will stand or hang, and also personally placed the furniture in its own specific locations \u2013 not just vintage pieces, but pared-down, modernist chairs he designed himself (they were briefly commercially available in the 00s, and may be again). \u201cI\u2019ve been to the store in New York and Tokyo, and seeing how the space is organised and the furniture he\u2019s done, I like his selection, I feel there\u2019s a common interest there,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.artspace.com/artist/shawn-kuruneru\" title=\"\">Kuruneru</a>, whose swirling, black ink paintings hang in two of the Paris stores.</p> <p>Common interest is key in Slimane\u2019s collaborations, both with artists and musicians \u2013 likeminded, creative people whose work exhibits some kind of sympathy of spirit.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s midnight on Sunday in Paris, in a basement club called Le Dandy, and the team from French fashion house Celine are celebrating. The third band of the night are playing \u2013 Brooklyn punk-funkers Bodega, who provided the soundtrack for the menswear show earlier that evening. The artist David Kramer is here with his wife \u2013 Kramer\u2019s nostalgic, witty, Technicolor paintings featured on the show\u2019s invitation, and slogans from his work such as, \u201cI have nostalgia for things I probably have never known,\u201d were transposed on to the clothes and floppy straw baskets in the spring/summer 2020 collection. Dressed in jeans, boots and a white T-shirt speckled with holes, Hedi Slimane, Celine\u2019s creative director, takes photographs of the crowd, a collection of models, friends and co-workers, who are all enjoying the chance to cut loose into Monday morning as Bodega tear into last year\u2019s excellent single How Did This Happen? While his aesthetic is instantly recognisable \u2013 lean, sharp, rock\u2019n\u2019roll \u2013 Slimane has always relished the chance to open up his vision to other contributors and points of view. \u201cHe has developed a very distinct visual vocabulary,\u201d says LA-based sculptor Oscar Tuazon, \u201cand I think it thrives in contrast or an unexpected juxtaposition of elements.\u201d For two decades, both as a photographer and fashion designer for Dior Homme, Saint Laurent and now Celine, Slimane has collaborated with emerging musicians. He has commissioned bands such as These New Puritans and SWMRS to create the soundtrack to fashion shows, and documented their lives in books such as London Birth of a Cult. A diehard music fan, Slimane has been deeply inspired by the greatest rock performers of the past 20 years. However, his recent work at Celine has thrown the spotlight on to another group of collaborators: artists. Slimane was announced as Celine\u2019s new creative director in January 2018, with a mandate to introduce menswear and eventually couture. From 2012-16 he had overhauled Saint Laurent, a project which more than doubled the brand\u2019s turnover, and redefined the role of the modern fashion designer. For Slimane, the clothes are only part of the story \u2013 he\u2019s responsible for everything, from photographing the advertising campaigns and designing the sets for his elaborate fashion shows, right down to look and paper quality of the shopping bags. Of course, this 360-degree approach includes designing Celine\u2019s stores. So far, remodelled branches in New York, LA, Tokyo, Milan and Paris have been unveiled, ranging from an imposing glass box in Madison Avenue to the flagship on Rue de Grenelle in Paris, a tactile temple of marble and reclaimed oak, with plinths and shelves that \u2013 thanks to LED lighting \u2013 seem to float just above the concrete floor. Slimane\u2019s stores for Saint Laurent had been modernist and monumental. For Celine, he wanted something more intimate. Yes, the stores would embody a kind of brutalism involving stainless steel, black granite threaded with ginger and cream and wood, but there would also be plenty of chairs to sit on, books to read, people to talk to, materials to stroke (not just the clothes, but the building\u2019s surfaces), music to listen to \u2013 and artworks to look at. Which is where the new Celine Art Project comes in. It encompasses almost 20 painters and sculptors, ranging from emerging talents such as Shawn Kuruneru to huge names such as Theaster Gates, who have had work either commissioned or acquired for Celine\u2019s stores around the world as they are redesigned by Slimane. The stores have been envisaged as not simply places to buy clothes, but as salons in which to hang out and explore culture, proposals for a 21st-century maison. \u201cThere\u2019s a real understanding that [the store] is a public space,\u201d says Tuazon, who has made a piece for the Grenelle store. \u201cIt has restrictions, but it is a place where anybody can walk in the door and the levels of engagement vary \u2013 not everybody\u2019s there to buy.\u201d Tuazon\u2019s work Mobile Floor is mounted on the wall but looks a bit like the floorplan of a small structure, detailed in contrasting wood, some of which was sourced from parquet panels from a house in the same Left Bank neighbourhood as the store, \u201cso it has a connection to that place and history\u201d. Like many of the other works in the Celine Art Project, it begs to be touched. \u201cThe store is welcoming in a different way than an art gallery,\u201d Tuazon says. \u201cThere, you\u2019re asked to look at something and leave. Here, you\u2019re asked to look at something and stay. It comes down to touch \u2013 people can go into the store and touch things.\u201d Certainly, in the Avenue Montaigne store in Paris I am encouraged to rattle the painted chains of a sculpture by Davina Semo. Called We Don\u2019t Win Any More, the black chains have been hung to form two giant X\u2019s. Many of the works Slimane commissioned are rough-edged and almost architectural, a contrast to the soft luxuriousness of the clothes. The sculptor Virginia Overton has a work on each American coast.

I cut the full sheet of plywood into 20 triangular sections and then reassembled it into the current shape: usefulness restored.\u201d Canadian sculptor and installation artist Rochelle Goldberg, meanwhile, has created a sequence of ceramic masks called Composite Release, which have been placed in the changing rooms of the Milan Montenapoleone and Paris Duphot stores, \u201cconfronting the private sphere of the patron and everything he or she brings to the mirror\u201d, the artist says. Other works in the Celine Art Project include David Adamo\u2019s totemic whittled cedar columns in two Paris stores; Gates\u2019s Small Stumble With Mountain, a black concrete pillar with two grey stones on top; and James Balmforth\u2019s Surface Response (Stack), large chunks of steel and slag placed on top of one another with three smooth, grey surfaces and a black, jagged one, commissioned for Madison Avenue.

Common interest is key in Slimane\u2019s collaborations, both with artists and musicians \u2013 likeminded, creative people whose work exhibits some kind of sympathy of spirit. (\u201cHe found my work to be very strange,\u201d says Goldberg. \u201cAnd strange can of course be attractive.\u201d) Slimane\u2019s ultimate aim is to uncover new talent and create a community with shared attitudes and aesthetic values, in which music, design, art and fashion all express a way of seeing the world. Other artists\u2019 work has been incorporated into Slimane\u2019s clothes design; most recently Kramer, but also artists like Seth Bogart, frontman of Hunx and his Punx, whose cartoon scribbles covered shirts and shoes in a Saint Laurent capsule collection released in 2014. Slimane\u2019s first collection for Celine, meanwhile, saw Christian Marclay \u2013 famous for his 24-hour film masterpiece The Clock \u2013 create pop art-style cartoon panels which were embroidered on coats and jackets (Pet Shop Boys singer Neil Tennant wore a Slimane/Marclay parka when performing with the Killers during their headline set at Glastonbury this summer). None of the artists believe that their work is weakened by being put in a fashion context. \u201cIt\u2019s the moment to recognise that fashion has historically been a female-dominated domain while the art world has been a male-dominated endeavour,\u201d Goldberg says. \u201cThere is an embedded misogyny in the exclusion of fashion as an outlet for thought and action.\u201d Overton, meanwhile, simply says that it\u2019s refreshing to have a work displayed somewhere unusual: \u201cUnexpected places like the Celine stores are nice because we can experience the work in new ways.\u201d Tuazon likes that the store itself acts as a performance arena for shoppers trying on new clothes \u2013 and that while the clothes may be for sale, there are also objects in the store, like his works, that can\u2019t be bought: \u201cThere can be an interesting tension between objects in two different states.\u201d As further revamped stores open around the world \u2013 London\u2019s Mount Street has just relaunched and 45 more will have opened by the end of the year \u2013 the Celine Art Project will continue to evolve. \u201cHedi\u2019s a creative person so he understands the process and the support artists need,\u201d Tuazon says. \u201cHe\u2019s really committed to making the space work.\u201d With their collision of opposites \u2013 public and private, rough and soft, commercial and intellectual, high and low \u2013 these spaces are Slimane\u2019s design philosophy made concrete.",

Their games will be free and live to view online with expert commentary.</p> <p>The Ding v Yu semi-final in the $1.6m World Cup at Khanty-Mansiysk, Siberia, is tied at 1-1, two draws, after the regulation classical games and will now be settled by speed tie-break games at increasingly faster time rates.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/20/chess-jeffrey-xiong-emulate-bobby-fischer-beating-no2-seed\">Chess: Jeffery Xiong aims to emulate Bobby Fischer after beating No2 seed</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yu, 25, was not expected to reach the semi-final but in his last two matches the world No 15 has knocked out Russia\u2019s Ian Nepomniachtchi and Nikita Vitiugov, recovering from losing positions against both.</p> <p>The semi-final winners, Azerbaijan\u2019s Teimour Radjabov and either Ding or Yu, both qualify for the 2020 candidates to decide Carlsen\u2019s next challenger but Ding already has an assured qualification place via his world No 3 rating.</p> <p>International Chess Federation (Fide) rules state that the World Cup qualification has a higher priority than that derived from ratings. So, if Ding reaches the final, his rating place would go to the next in line, most probably the world No 4, Anish Giri of the Netherlands.</p> <p>Ekaterinburg is the venue for the candidates and on home ground Russia could have as many as three of the eight players. Two places go to the top finishers in the Fide Grand Prix, where after Moscow and Riga, with Hamburg and Tel Aviv events still to come, Nepomniachtchi and Alexander Grischuk are well placed to qualify. The candidates organising federation also nominates a wildcard, which would likely be the 2016 world title challenger, Sergey Karjakin.</p> <p>Players from the same country have to meet in early rounds of the candidates but three out of eight, if it happens, would be a major advantage for Russia. Ding\u2019s chances to become Carlsen\u2019s challenger would be much stronger if Yu is also in the field.</p> <p>If Ding does lose Saturday\u2019s tie-break, there will inevitably be calls of \u201cfix\u201d. For Ding, a championship match against the legendary Carlsen is the prize above all else, and he will see a helping hand from Yu as a counter to the weight of Russian numbers stacked against him.

      "bodyText": "China\u2019s world No 3, Ding Liren, is favourite to become the next challenger for Magnus Carlsen\u2019s global crown but the 26-year-old\u2019s chances of winning the deciding 2020 candidates could hang on what happens when he plays his compatriot Yu Yangyi in tie-break games on Saturday starting at 11am. Their games will be free and live to view online with expert commentary. The Ding v Yu semi-final in the $1.6m World Cup at Khanty-Mansiysk, Siberia, is tied at 1-1, two draws, after the regulation classical games and will now be settled by speed tie-break games at increasingly faster time rates. Yu, 25, was not expected to reach the semi-final but in his last two matches the world No 15 has knocked out Russia\u2019s Ian Nepomniachtchi and Nikita Vitiugov, recovering from losing positions against both. The semi-final winners, Azerbaijan\u2019s Teimour Radjabov and either Ding or Yu, both qualify for the 2020 candidates to decide Carlsen\u2019s next challenger but Ding already has an assured qualification place via his world No 3 rating. International Chess Federation (Fide) rules state that the World Cup qualification has a higher priority than that derived from ratings. So, if Ding reaches the final, his rating place would go to the next in line, most probably the world No 4, Anish Giri of the Netherlands. Ekaterinburg is the venue for the candidates and on home ground Russia could have as many as three of the eight players. Two places go to the top finishers in the Fide Grand Prix, where after Moscow and Riga, with Hamburg and Tel Aviv events still to come, Nepomniachtchi and Alexander Grischuk are well placed to qualify. The candidates organising federation also nominates a wildcard, which would likely be the 2016 world title challenger, Sergey Karjakin. Players from the same country have to meet in early rounds of the candidates but three out of eight, if it happens, would be a major advantage for Russia. Ding\u2019s chances to become Carlsen\u2019s challenger would be much stronger if Yu is also in the field. If Ding does lose Saturday\u2019s tie-break, there will inevitably be calls of \u201cfix\u201d. For Ding, a championship match against the legendary Carlsen is the prize above all else, and he will see a helping hand from Yu as a counter to the weight of Russian numbers stacked against him. His action will be damaging to the highly ranked Giri, who is unlikely to qualify by a different route, but sympathy for the Dutchman will be muted since he played in the 2016 candidates while his public image has been damaged by his reputation as a chronic drawist. The candidates, and events leading up to it, already has some history of arranged results and of Russian players ganging up against a dangerous rival. At the end of the very first candidates in Budapest 1950, the leader Isaac Boleslavsky made tame draws in his final two games to allow his friend David Bronstein, judged to have better chances in a title match against Mikhail Botvinnik, to catch up. At Curacao 1962, a 28-round tropical marathon where the participants needed to ration energy, there was a non-aggression pact among Tigran Petrosian, Paul Keres and Efim Geller who made quick draws among themselves and played hard against Bobby Fischer and Viktor Korchnoi. In the last round of the 1970 interzonal in Palma de Mallorca, Milan Matulovic accepted a bribe from Soviet officials to lose to Mark Taimanov, who qualified but then famously lost 6-0 to Fischer. The other World Cup semi-final featured Radjabov\u2019s smooth, impressive and classical win, where his only blemish was to miss the stronger 19 b4! The Azerbaijani, 32, has played rarely in the last few years but will now be favourite to win the final and the World Cup if Yu Yangyi turns out to be his opponent. Maxime Vachier-Lagrave is France\u2019s best ever player and is ranked in the top 10, but at age 29 he has never qualified as a candidate. Earlier, Yu Yangyi scored a farcical quarter-final victory over Nikita Vitiugov in sudden death Armageddon, needed due to a 4-4 match score. The Chinese player carelessly conceded two pawns in the opening and the Russian could then also have won a piece by a simple 17th move. Vitiugov failed to see the easy opportunity, made a series of errors and lost. At the end Yu quickly signed the score sheets and left the playing hall, while Vitiugov sat for several minutes staring at the board in disbelief. 3638 1 Rh4! h6 2 Bh2!

Kenyon would be chief executive.</p> <p>While the brochure is genuine it all seems highly unlikely to actually happen.

We wouldn\u2019t want to scramble through the newspapers to see if things have been written about us. That\u2019s our rightful place. I never said it was going to be easy this season.

His absence at a team-bonding meal led to further scrutiny on his Old Trafford future but United manager Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The situation is he finished the game, which is fantastic, but he got a knock to his ankle which is very swollen.

Both sides had disappointing League Cup exits in midweek. The Cherries were beaten by Burton and the Hammers lost at Oxford but Howe is not too concerned having beaten Everton and Southampton in his last two Premier League games by the same scoreline, 3-1. The Cherries and the Hammers in a top-six clash? What a time to be alive! </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Our early season form with the Everton and Southampton wins, in my mind it\u2019s very positive as we approach West Ham and it\u2019s important we put on a good show on Saturday. Our early game against West Ham last season was very early in the manager\u2019s reign there and he was still implementing his ideas. I think they have very good players and they\u2019ve had a good start to the season so it promises to be a good game. Their general performances have been very strong and it\u2019s two teams who have been strong at the start of the season.

He played an hour at Burton without any worrying setbacks. \u201c[It\u2019s] great to have our captain Simon Francis back after a long time out.

As for Sunday\u2019s match, Newcastle will be without Jonjo Shelvey. \u201c[He] has a grade two hamstring so he\u2019ll be missing for a few weeks. Sean Longstaff will be OK. It will be good to see him again. Shelvey picked it up in the game last week. I think he has been hampered by a thigh injury. It\u2019s still not 100% right.\u201d </p> <p>He also spoke to BBC Radio 5 earlier about Andy Carroll\u2019s ongoing battle to get fit.

We know he\u2019s a very good player. Our aim now is; how can we get him on the pitch frequently and regularly? Obviously you need some luck along the way. But a fit and firing Andy Carroll would help more teams.\u201d Maybe Carroll should just be a 20-minute impact sub these days. An incredible jumping man who is just thrown into the fray towards the end of games. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d8dbff38f081108db9bdb39\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-27T08:34:04.987Z\">9.34am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Preamble</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Morning all. </strong>The League Cup games are done and dusted and we\u2019re straight back into the seventh round of Premier League matches. Eight of them are on Saturday which is quite a rarity in these days of spreading matches out across the weekend. Kicking things off tomorrow at 12.30pm are league leaders, <strong>Liverpool</strong>, who travel to Bramall Lane for a 12.30pm kick-off against <strong>Sheffield United</strong> hoping to go eight points clear of <strong>Manchester City</strong>. Pep Guardiola\u2019s side are in action at <strong>Everton</strong> in a 5.30pm kick-off. J\u00fcrgen Klopp managed to rotate all 11 of his starters against Chelsea when they beat MK Dons 2-0, so there\u2019ll be no worry of fatigue. The Blades face a daunting task against the Reds, who have won their last 15 Premier League matches stretching back to last season, but Chris Wilder is backing his on-loan Manchester United goalkeeper, Dean Henderson, to perform well on what could be a busy day between the sticks. </p> <p>\u201cLiverpool\u2019s forward three have been unbelievable for the past couple of years,\u201d said Wilder. \u201cIn terms of the quality they\u2019ve got, the mobility and way they interchange, we\u2019re going to have to have an unbelievably great day to keep the ball out of our net. Our goalkeeper is going to have to make saves, we understand that, but I feel we have the best young goalkeeper in the country.\u201d</p> <p>In the 3pm kick-offs, the bottom two meet at Molineux. <strong>Watford</strong> and <strong>Wolves</strong> are yet to win a game this season. A six-pointer already? Nearer the top, fifth-placed <strong>West Ham</strong> face sixth-placed <strong>Bournemouth</strong>. The Hammers were, erm, hammered 4-0 by Oxford in the League Cup but Manuel Pellegrini made a raft of changes and their rock at the back, Angelo Ogbonna, did not start.<strong> Bournemouth</strong> are scoring for fun in the league at the moment, while the Hammers have conceded only two goals in their past five league games. It\u2019s an intriguing one. Third-bottom <strong>Aston Villa</strong> host <strong>Burnley</strong>, who have yet to win away this season. Opportunity knocks for Villa to move out of the bottom three. </p> <p>After the embarrassment of defeat at Colchester on Tuesday and murmurings of discontent in the ranks, how Maurico Pochettino could do with a win when his former club <strong>Southampton</strong> visit <strong>Tottenham</strong>. Saints beat their local rivals Pompey in the League Cup in midweek but in their last home game, against Bournemouth, they were second best as they lost 3-1. Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl will expect a reaction. It could be a tricky one for Spurs. </p> <p>There is <strong>Chelsea v Brighton</strong> and <strong>Crystal Palace v Norwich</strong> to look foward to on Saturday, too, and as mentioned earlier, Everton host Manchester City. Pressure is building on Marco Silva after an underwhelming start to the season, including the 2-0 home defeat by Sheffield United last time out. Silva is still struggling to work out what his best team is. He could do with figuring it out quick if City play anything like they did in last week\u2019s 8-0 hammering of Watford. And on Sunday, <strong>Newcastle</strong> take on in-form <strong>Leicester</strong> at the King Power Stadium with takeover talk in the air during the buildup to the match. <strong>Manchester United </strong>host <strong>Arsenal</strong> on Monday night. </p> <p>For further reading, here\u2019s our 10 things to look out for in the Premier League this weekend. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/27/premier-league-10-things-to-look-out-for-this-weekend\">Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekend</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-27T08:37:58.373Z\">at 9.37am BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Right, thanks for your company. Have a cracking weekend! And do join us for MBM coverage of the following on Saturday: Sheffield United v Liverpool, Premier League 12.30pm (BST) Tottenham v Southampton, Chelsea v Brighton: clockwatch 3pm Everton v Manchester City, Premier League 5.30pm Atl\u00e9tico Madrid v Real Madrid, La Liga 8pm Here\u2019s an exclusive interview with Bournemouth\u2019s Joshua King on everything from Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r to Eddie Howe and Erling Braut Haaland. King was absorbing company, none more so than when discussing former his team-mate, Ravel Morrison: If you ask any player at United back then, Ravel was just different class. Ravel could have been the level just below Messi and Ronaldo. People have probably got the wrong impression of him. Sometimes when you grow up, it\u2019s rough and you can\u2019t control that but he\u2019s got the biggest heart and he is easily the most talented player I\u2019ve ever played with.\u201d \u201cRegarding United fans overhyping their young players, I think they\u2019re doing it to Dan James as well,\u201d emails Ravikiran. \u201cBoth Rashford and Martial when they first came started really well. United began to fully depend on them, which left a toll in their (still young) legs. Already United look dependent on James.\u201d Get the lowdown on the big one: Oh, we do spoil you. More too-hot-to-touch transfer news just in: former Chelsea youngster Josh McEachran has joined Birmingham City on a two-year deal after a trial with the Championship club. The 26-year-old, a free agent since leaving Brentford at the end of last season, had loan spells at Swansea and Watford. A fine day for freebies, with Danny Simpson earlier penning a deal at Huddersfield. Don\u2019t say we don\u2019t look after you. Essential late-afternoon reading: Arsenal news: Emery has been talking about how big a boost having Rob Holding, Kieran Tierney and H\u00e9ctor Beller\u00edn back in the fold is. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing news,\u201d he says. \u201cWe can be a better competitive team with them. For us being available with every player is the perfect moment. Now we have two injuries, [Alexandre] Lacazette and Emile Smith Rowe. Hopefully in a few weeks they can be training with us and available to play.\u201d Get a load of the Mauricio Pochettino derby: More from Emery on naming Xhaka skipper. \u201cI gave them [the squad] some values, some qualities and attributes to decide the captain and then I used a vote,\u201d he says, rather passionately. \u201cHe [Xhaka] is a good man, a good professional, a good player. Sometimes he made a mistake \u2013 yes \u2013 but he can learn and correct that mistake. His challenge is to change that opinion and, above all, show his personality and give help every time [to the team].\u201d Unai Emery confirms Granit Xhaka is the new permanent Arsenal captain, adding the palyers voted for the midfielder to assume the armband. Emery has also outlined his five-man leadership group, which sounds very David Brent but is genuine. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is vice-captain, followed by H\u00e9ctor Beller\u00edn, Alexandre Lacazette and then, er, Mesut \u00d6zil. Xhaka is mature. He has experience. In the dressing room, the players vote him as first. I trust and believe in him. His challenge is to change opinion, improve and give us help each time. Looking forward to the big one? Nobody said it was easy No one ever said it would be this hard Oh take me back to the start ... Roll up! Roll up! Get yer match previews: This is tenuous Premier League news at best ... but here it goes while we wait for Unai Emery, who is apparently running behind schedule owing to a longer-than-anticipated training session and a squad photo. Right, ready? The former Reading and Bristol City striker Leroy Lita has joined Southern League side Salisbury City, who are managed by Steve Claridge, on a short-term deal. Nothing quite like some lukewarm Moussa Sissoko soundbites to get you pumped for the weekend, right? Fresh from signing a new four-year contract until 2023, the Frenchman mused: \u201cHopefully I can give my best to the club for a long time and hopefully we can get some trophies together. I think on both sides I\u2019ve learnt a lot, both as a man and as a footballer [since joining Spurs in 2016]. The talent of the players and even talent of the coaching staff is unbelievable so you learn a lot from them, even as a person as well I\u2019ve learnt a lot. Hopefully we can achieve some great moments.\u201d Some red-hot transfer news: Huddersfield have snapped up the former Leicester and Manchester United defender Danny Simpson on a contract until the end of the season. The 32-year-old right-back has trained with the Terriers for the past two weeks and has sufficiently impressed Danny and Nicky Cowley. And here\u2019s a meaningless quirk: Simpson will wear the No 17 shirt at Huddersfield \u2013 the same number he wore when winning the Premier League title ... Unai Emery is running late \u2013 so get yer fix below for the time being: Unai Emery is up shortly, with the Arsenal manager expected to confirm Granit Xhaka as the team\u2019s permanent captain. A youthful side breezed past Nottingham Forest in midweek, with the 18-year-old Gabriel Martinelli, who scored twice, among those catch Emery\u2019s eye. \u201cHe deserves it,\u201d Emery said. \u201cHe has worked and trained with big spirit and a big performance.\u201d Leicester City team news: Brendan Rodgers says midfielder James Maddison is a doubt for the Newcastle game on Sunday. \u201cHe\u2019s put some weight on his ankle so we\u2019ll see over the coming days,\u201d Rodgers says. \u201cHe\u2019s a big talent and he\u2019s been playing great. We\u2019ve got a really strong squad. We made some changes in the week, and the rhythm, speed and intensity in the team was the same. It\u2019s just the risk of whether he\u2019s going to last the game or not. He\u2019s such a talented player, we\u2019ll give him every chance.\u201d Some murmurs in Manchester that Bernardo Silva submitted a letter to the FA on Thursday, in which he expressed regret for any unintentional offence caused as a result of that tweet, stressing that that was not his intention. Mendy has reportedly also issued a supporting statement, outlining he did not take offence. Earlier, his manager Pep Guardiola said: \u201cIt was just a joke. The same happened a thousand million times with white people, it\u2019s the same. If someone is offended I can understand it. Bernardo is maybe going to take a lesson from it and it won\u2019t happen again.\u201d Crystal Palace team news: Wilfired Zaha is fit to face Norwich after picking up a knock against Wolves but Saturday comes too soon for Connor Wickham, who has trained all week. Mamadou Sakho is touch and go with a \u201csmall problem\u201d says Roy Hodgson. \u201cThe team has responded very well this week,\u201d says the Palace manager after they were forced to settle for a point last weekend. \u201cThose cruel blows are part and parcel of football. It\u2019s a painful process but we\u2019re looking forward to hopefully getting those points back tomorrow.\u201d As for Norwich\u2019s primary threat, he adds: \u201cHe was a little too young to play under me [for Finland, during 2006-7], but I remember Teemu Pukki coming through, I knew he was a major Finnish talent they were very excited about.\u201d Everton team news: Marco Silva confirms Andr\u00e9 Gomes and Jean-Philippe Gbamin will miss Saturday\u2019s game against Manchester City. Djibril Sidib\u00e9 could feature. \u201cUnfortunately for us he didn\u2019t do the pre-season, he just arrived in the last days of the [transfer] market,\u201d Silva says. \u201cI believe every time we see Djibril play, the better he will be and the more he will integrate.\u201d Pep Guardiola speaks. He settles into his chair at Manchester City\u2019s auditorium and is straight on to the defensive regarding that Bernardo Silva tweet. \u201cIf they believe, other people believe, if the FA believe Bernardo is this type of player, they are completely wrong,\u201d he says. \u201cThey judge one joke, I judge three years of work with him, every single day how he is, his friendship. Benjamin is like a brother for Bernardo. It was just a joke. The same happened a thousand million times with white people, it\u2019s the same. Maybe Bernardo will take a lesson and it will not happen again.\u201d It\u2019s not all doom and gloom at Hotspur Way, for Moussa Sissoko has signed a spanking new four-year contract. That\u2019s a long-term renewal for a Spurs player in their 30s, which represents a considerable change of tack. The midfielder, a \u00a330m signing from Newcastle in 2016, has made eight appearances this season. Norwich City team news: goalkeeper Tim Krul is out but right-back Max Aarons will be part of the squad at Crystal Palace. \u201cIt\u2019s still a bit doubtful with Ralf Fahrmann as well,\u201d says manager Daniel Farke. \u201cWe are still missing Christoph Zimmermann and Timm Klose as well. Mario Vrancic is still out as is Onel Hern\u00e1ndez. I hope a few players return after the international break. It\u2019s important to gain points now, even with this situation.\u201d Aston Villa team news: Henri Lansbury is back jogging but remains out, while James Chester, who played in an Under-23s game on Monday, is still a few weeks away from first-team action. Jonathan Kodjia is back training, \u201clooking like a super-hero\u201d, says manager Dean Smith owing to the face mask he has been wearing after fracturing a cheekbone. Villa host Burnley on Saturday in search of a first Premier League win in four matches. \u201cI look at the eight games we have played this season and I think only Tottenham have been better than us,\u201d says Smith, whose Villa side enter the weekend in the relegation zone. United\u2019s season may well be grim, but it will still be gripping. They\u2019re like the England cricket team now \u2013 forever landing on the ladder or the snake, skipping the dull squares in between So, Fikayo Tomori, Tammy Abraham, Hudson-Odoi and Reece James could all feature at Stamford Bridge this weekend. More brownie points incoming for the Chelsea academy. What about Christian Pulisic, a \u00a358m signing? The USA winger started in midweek against Grimsby. Lampard has had his say. I have four wingers to chose from now they are all fit. Pulisic we forget is 21 because of the price tag. It is normal to have an adaptation period. He has shown some good moments this season and in pre-season but he must do it daily. He needs time to adapt but we support him on that. His time will come.\u201d Chelsea team news: Antonio R\u00fcdiger will not feature against Brighton owing to a recurring groin injury, says Frank Lampard. The Chelsea boss also confirms Reece James and Callum Hudson-Odoi, who featured in midweek, will be included in his 18-man squad. Andreas Christensen is ready to rumble, while Olivier Giroud could feature following illness. Emerson Palmieri, Lampard says, is likely to return after the international break. Another big plus that Ruben Loftus-Cheek has been outside jogging this week. Championship leaders Leeds will want to return to winning ways at Charlton on Saturday \u2013 but, to do so, they will have to get one over on their former midfielder, Lee Bowyer, who has done a sterling job in south-east London. \u201cLeeds were the best side I played for \u2013 we were relentless and ruthless,\u201d said Bowyer, whose Charlton side are eighth. \u201cMy best memory was AC Milan. Scoring in the 91st minute and the place just erupted. We had the attitude we were never going to lose. When you have got that \u2013 and hard work \u2013 then you\u2019ve got something special. We have got that here [at Charlton] as well. That is what I have tried to instil.\u201d Good news for West Ham! Manuel Lanzini is in the squad for Saturday\u2019s trip to Bournemouth after returning to training. Michail Antonio and Winston Reid remain absent from the travelling party. Asked if Bournemouth can battle their way into the top six, Manuel Pellegrini said: \u201cWe are just starting the season and we know that a lot of clubs \u2013 Everton, Aston Villa, and more \u2013have a lot of good squads and can be involved in that position.\u201d Forget Dr Pepper, meet Dr Cool: Manuel Pellegrini says he fancies West Ham to bounce back from a humbling 4-0 defeat to Oxford by giving Bournemouth a pasting: I hope that was an accident. We must understand that we have to play against every team with 100% concentration. I don\u2019t think that you can make a decision and think about one game. The performance was not what we expected but I see the players working on the training ground. I am absolutely sure they have the level to perform on another night.\u201d Of Saturday\u2019s opponents, he says: It is a team that plays offensive football, with two strikers and Joshua King on the left side, which is like another striker. We must be concentrated in defending but we will go for the three points like always and attack from the first minute.\u201d Some lunchtime listening: And reading: Below the line, bashooter is worried Mason Greenwood is being too heavily vaunted and overhyped by Manchester United supporters. \u201cYou\u2019d think they\u2019d know better after they said similar things about the likes of [Federico] Macheda and [James] Wilson,\u201d he says. \u201cWhere are they now anyway? Hopefully Solskj\u00e6r will be sensible about how he handles him, and doesn\u2019t burden him with the task of saving an ailing club.\u201d Well, Macheda, 28, is at Panathinaikos and Wilson \u2013 somehow still only 23 \u2013 is up at Aberdeen. A quick glance at the Championship, and it\u2019s a mightily big game for Nathan Jones and Stoke against Nottingham Forest tonight. Stoke host in-form Forest having not tasted victory since April and not won before their home fans for 209 days and counting. Jones did not speak to the media pre-match, with his assistant, Paul Hart, giving him a breather amid the pressure. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s feeling it, but he appears to me to be dealing with it pretty well. He\u2019s ok. It\u2019s impossible to hide behind idiosyncratic words ... it\u2019s serious. I don\u2019t think he expected us to be in this situation, I don\u2019t think any of us did, but we are here and it has to be dealt with in a positive way. I know this is trite, but you don\u2019t become a bad coach/manager overnight. His presentations are excellent, his management of the players is excellent. Deal with the basics, win a football match. Alex Ferguson was a game away from the sack and the manager of Coventry [Mark Robins] pulled him out of it. We have to trust in the players.\u201d Get a load of Dani Alves talking Bahia, Brazil and Barcelona: I\u2019m going after that dream to be champion, to close an era with the Brazilian national team, to help my country get back on top. You know what motivates me most? When everybody stops believing in me. When they say: \u2018This guy is worthless, this guy can\u2019t play in midfield, can\u2019t do this or that.\u2019 Just wait. On the way there I\u2019m going to work like a filho da puta, like I\u2019ve done all my life. That\u2019s why I came here. I was comfortable in Europe, but I like discomfort. Nothing in life is easy. If you want to reach you objectives, you have to make the effort. Unless your dad owns the team \u2013 when my dad ran our S\u00e3o Paulo, I always played and played up front.\u201d Here we go again \u2013 and down an extremely familiar path this time. We are talking potential takeovers of Newcastle United \u2013 reports of deals being supposedly close tend to average about two a year \u2013 and the news that Peter Kenyon is back for a second attempt at trying to buy Mike Ashley out. This time the former Chelsea and Manchester United chief executive has teamed up with GACP sports \u2013 a Florida based investment firm who hold a 14 per cent stake in Bordeaux \u2013 and they have produced a 46-page document outlining their plans for Newcastle should Ashley agree to a \u00a3125m down payment with the remainder of the \u00a3300m asking price paid in instalments over three years. Kenyon would be chief executive. While the brochure is genuine it all seems highly unlikely to actually happen. As Ashley himself said in a rare interview in the summer when a successful takeover at St James\u2019 Park finally happens the overwhelmingly odds are that it will be conducted in such discretion no one bar the involved parties will get a hint of anything being in the offing until it is announced. Manchester City\u2019s Abu Dhabi buyout serves as the template for the deals that actually happen rather than are merely talked up. Newcastle, as is their habit in such situations \u2013 think Amanda Staveley, think the Dubai-based Bin Zayed Group, think Kenyon\u2019s initial attempt \u2013 are saying nothing but the brochure raised more questions than answers. Not least why would a buyer confident of pulling off a takeover leak details to a newspaper? As Steve Bruce, who said the first he heard of it was Friday morning and that he had not spoken to Ashley recently, said: \u201cWatch this space\u201dHe did not add \u201cwith a considerable degree of scepticism\u201d but such an approach is probably prudent ... Steve Bruce says he is in the dark with regards to yet more talk of a Newcastle takeover. Reports this morning suggest Peter Kenyon, the former Manchester United and Chelsea chief executive, has launched a \u00a3300m bid for the club. \u201cIt\u2019s happened that many times,\u201d said Bruce, \u201ceven from reading about it from afar. At this club, in particular, there\u2019s always speculation surrounding it and it\u2019s never happened. Let\u2019s watch this space. You have to get used to it. It\u2019s happened to me three or four times previously.\u201d Could 17-year-old Mason Greenwood get the nod against Arsenal on Monday? Well, Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r is playing his cards close to his chest and says he will spend the next 48 hours mulling over whether to include the teenager, who has scored against Astana and Rochdale over the past week, in his starting XI at Old Trafford. \u201cMason has proved when he gets in the box he is dangerous,\u201d Solskj\u00e6r said. \u201cI am not worried about him at all but we have to manage him. You can\u2019t throw him in at the deep end all the time. I have the weekend to think about it.\u201d Arsenal reportedly naming Granit Xhaka as captain does at least put an end to Unai Emery passing the armband around the dressing room. According to our friends at Opta, since the start of 2018-19, Arsenal are the only club to have had as many as six different players start more than one Premier League game as captain. Laurent Koscielny (13 games) Xhaka (10) Mesut \u00d6zil (eight) Petr Cech (seven) Aaron Ramsey (four) Nacho Monreal (two). Klopp has been busy bigging up Chris Wilder ahead of their first duel since 2007. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible what Chris is doing there,\u201d says Klopp, whose side go to Bramall Lane. \u201cA really great coach and I\u2019m looking forward to facing his team, a really aggressive, good pressing [team] and an interesting pattern when the centre-halves overlap whoever is there, the winger or whatever. I\u2019m four years in England now and I don\u2019t know everything about every club but Sheffield seems to be a big club and deserves to be in the league.\u201d Thanks, Gregg. Let\u2019s get stuck straight into some breaking Arsenal news, with the BBC\u2019s David Ornstein reporting Unai Emery has named Granit Xhaka as the team\u2019s new captain following a discussion with his players. Xhaka is expected to take the armband on a permanent basis, having led the side in six of their eight matches this season. Former skipper Laurent Koscielny left the club for Bordeaux in the summer. I\u2019m going to hand the blog over to Ben Fisher now. He\u2019ll guide you through the lunchtime flurry of press conferences. Bye. J\u00fcrgen Klopp is speaking at Melwood before Liverpool\u2019s trip to Sheffield United. He\u2019s confirmed that Xherdan Shaqiri is not available as he has a small calf tear. But Divock Origi and Sadio Man\u00e9 are both fit again. He was also glowing in his praise for Liverpool\u2019s stand-in goalkeeper, saying there is no need to fast-track Alisson back into the first XI even though the Brazilian is almost ready to train again. Adri\u00e1n\u2019s progress has made everything easier. He is doing a brilliant job and makes everything easier 100%. We can\u2019t rush injuries, we try not to do it. We don\u2019t like to task risks. We will see when Ali ready and Adrian is our goalie for now. Shaqiri is not ready. Still in rehab. Curtis Jones has another knock but that is it. [Alisson] looks like he\u2019s close but he\u2019s not in contention for tomorrow. But it looks like he can train with the team from Sunday. I don\u2019t know 100% but he\u2019s really close. Another player Klopp was cooing over, was Joel Matip, who he thinks has been one of Liverpool\u2019s best signings (he was a free transfer). Klopp believes Matip will be vital on Saturday. These second ball fights are so important. It is about being ready and aggressive and we have to show this. It\u2019s a complex job but it is not the first time against a team like Sheffield United. [They] are settled and they are quite impressive. It\u2019s their stadium. With the challenges you have, you grow. Joel [Matip] was always an incredible talent. He was 18 playing for Schalke, that\u2019s not easy. In a world of big transfer fees, signing Joel on free transfer was incredible, one of best pieces of business we did. That\u2019s what happens with footballers, with human beings, they grow.\u201d After a proposal for Bury to be readmitted to League Two next season was rejected by the English Football League\u2019s 71 member clubs on Thursday, the mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, has taken up the fight. He\u2019s an avid campaigner and does not give up a fight lightly. Not a bad man to have in your corner. Liverpool have a few injury concerns before they travel to Brammal Lane. Xherdan Shaqiri felt a twinge in his calf in training so was not available to face MK Dons and Sadio Man\u00e9 picked up a thigh strain against Chelsea. Though, as the picture shows above, he was in training yesterday so would appear to have recovered. J\u00fcrgen Klopp will issue an update in his press conference shortly. Liverpool haven\u2019t beaten Sheffield United away in 29 years. The last time they won there was the last time Liverpool were defending champions \u2013 25 August 1990. In case you\u2019ve been holding off on making plans to go to Qatar 2022 because you\u2019re worried you might not be able to take your preferred refreshment while out following your nation, here\u2019s a bit of news from Sean Ingle that might interest you. Here\u2019s more from Solskj\u00e6r on Manchester United\u2019s struggle this season. He says he\u2019s not bothered about criticism in the media and he\u2019s grateful to United fans for their support: I don\u2019t worry about what the press write about other teams or me and Man Utd. We are focused on what we have to do; to keep improving. Reading the papers doesn\u2019t change my view. Sometimes my kids are asking: \u2018What\u2019s this [criticism] all about?\u2019 When I was a player it was always Man Utd hogging the headlines. We wouldn\u2019t want to scramble through the newspapers to see if things have been written about us. That\u2019s our rightful place. I never said it was going to be easy this season. When we lose a game or go through difficult period we must keep our eyes on the prize and keep working in the direction we believe in. As for the fans, he says they\u2019re still behind him and his team: [They\u2019re] very, very positive \u2013 \u2018We can see what you\u2019re doing, keep going\u2019. It\u2019s easier to be positive when you meet face to face. I\u2019m amazed again by our supporters. You listen to the crowd at Old Trafford and they\u2019re amazing. Now\u2019s the time to be doing that because we\u2019re going through a difficult patch.\u201d Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba is in a \u201crace\u201d to be fit for Arsenal\u2019s visit to Manchester United on Monday evening. The midfielder is a doubt because of an ankle injury sustained in the Carabao Cup win over Rochdale in midweek. Pogba picked up a knock to an ankle on Wednesday. His absence at a team-bonding meal led to further scrutiny on his Old Trafford future but United manager Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r said: The situation is he finished the game, which is fantastic, but he got a knock to his ankle which is very swollen. It was better for him not to go there with the team and he\u2019s in a race, I would guess, for Monday.\u201d Pogba would be an eighth frontline player unavailable to Solskj\u00e6r. Eddie Howe is another manager who has risen early and got his press conference out of the way. Sixth-placed Bournemouth host fifth-placed West Ham tomorrow. Both sides had disappointing League Cup exits in midweek. The Cherries were beaten by Burton and the Hammers lost at Oxford but Howe is not too concerned having beaten Everton and Southampton in his last two Premier League games by the same scoreline, 3-1. The Cherries and the Hammers in a top-six clash? What a time to be alive! Our early season form with the Everton and Southampton wins, in my mind it\u2019s very positive as we approach West Ham and it\u2019s important we put on a good show on Saturday. Our early game against West Ham last season was very early in the manager\u2019s reign there and he was still implementing his ideas. I think they have very good players and they\u2019ve had a good start to the season so it promises to be a good game. Their general performances have been very strong and it\u2019s two teams who have been strong at the start of the season. We\u2019d like to win three in a row, the first time we\u2019ve done that in a while, and that\u2019s a huge incentive for us.\u201d Howe has his captain, Simon Francis, available again on Saturday too. He played an hour at Burton without any worrying setbacks. \u201c[It\u2019s] great to have our captain Simon Francis back after a long time out. With the stoppages and the flood-light failures we felt we had to bring him off to make sure he wouldn\u2019t stiffen up.\u201d Steve Bruce has been wheeled out early at Newcastle to talk about Sunday\u2019s game against Leicester. He says he knows little about the possible \u00a3300m takeover by a Peter Kenyon-led consortium. \u201cIt\u2019s news to me,\u201d are his exact quotes. As for Sunday\u2019s match, Newcastle will be without Jonjo Shelvey. \u201c[He] has a grade two hamstring so he\u2019ll be missing for a few weeks. Sean Longstaff will be OK. It will be good to see him again. Shelvey picked it up in the game last week. I think he has been hampered by a thigh injury. It\u2019s still not 100% right.\u201d He also spoke to BBC Radio 5 earlier about Andy Carroll\u2019s ongoing battle to get fit. It\u2019s been a long one hasn\u2019t it? \u201cOf his type there isn\u2019t anybody better,\u201d he said, begging the question what is \u201chis type\u201d? \u201cWe just hope he has a bit of luck in terms of injuries. We know he\u2019s a very good player. Our aim now is; how can we get him on the pitch frequently and regularly? Obviously you need some luck along the way. But a fit and firing Andy Carroll would help more teams.\u201d Maybe Carroll should just be a 20-minute impact sub these days. An incredible jumping man who is just thrown into the fray towards the end of games. Morning all. The League Cup games are done and dusted and we\u2019re straight back into the seventh round of Premier League matches. Eight of them are on Saturday which is quite a rarity in these days of spreading matches out across the weekend. Kicking things off tomorrow at 12.30pm are league leaders, Liverpool, who travel to Bramall Lane for a 12.30pm kick-off against Sheffield United hoping to go eight points clear of Manchester City. Pep Guardiola\u2019s side are in action at Everton in a 5.30pm kick-off. J\u00fcrgen Klopp managed to rotate all 11 of his starters against Chelsea when they beat MK Dons 2-0, so there\u2019ll be no worry of fatigue. The Blades face a daunting task against the Reds, who have won their last 15 Premier League matches stretching back to last season, but Chris Wilder is backing his on-loan Manchester United goalkeeper, Dean Henderson, to perform well on what could be a busy day between the sticks. \u201cLiverpool\u2019s forward three have been unbelievable for the past couple of years,\u201d said Wilder. \u201cIn terms of the quality they\u2019ve got, the mobility and way they interchange, we\u2019re going to have to have an unbelievably great day to keep the ball out of our net. Our goalkeeper is going to have to make saves, we understand that, but I feel we have the best young goalkeeper in the country.\u201d In the 3pm kick-offs, the bottom two meet at Molineux. Watford and Wolves are yet to win a game this season. A six-pointer already? Nearer the top, fifth-placed West Ham face sixth-placed Bournemouth. The Hammers were, erm, hammered 4-0 by Oxford in the League Cup but Manuel Pellegrini made a raft of changes and their rock at the back, Angelo Ogbonna, did not start. Bournemouth are scoring for fun in the league at the moment, while the Hammers have conceded only two goals in their past five league games. It\u2019s an intriguing one. Third-bottom Aston Villa host Burnley, who have yet to win away this season. Opportunity knocks for Villa to move out of the bottom three. After the embarrassment of defeat at Colchester on Tuesday and murmurings of discontent in the ranks, how Maurico Pochettino could do with a win when his former club Southampton visit Tottenham. Saints beat their local rivals Pompey in the League Cup in midweek but in their last home game, against Bournemouth, they were second best as they lost 3-1. Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl will expect a reaction. It could be a tricky one for Spurs. There is Chelsea v Brighton and Crystal Palace v Norwich to look foward to on Saturday, too, and as mentioned earlier, Everton host Manchester City. Pressure is building on Marco Silva after an underwhelming start to the season, including the 2-0 home defeat by Sheffield United last time out. Silva is still struggling to work out what his best team is. He could do with figuring it out quick if City play anything like they did in last week\u2019s 8-0 hammering of Watford. And on Sunday, Newcastle take on in-form Leicester at the King Power Stadium with takeover talk in the air during the buildup to the match. Manchester United host Arsenal on Monday night. For further reading, here\u2019s our 10 things to look out for in the Premier League this weekend.",

I worked as a sommelier in my hometown of New York before becoming enamoured with cocktails, and since then I\u2019ve never looked back.</p> <p>It was around the time that I started working as a bartender that the <a href=\"https://www.greygoose.com/en-gb/cocktails/l-orange/cosmopolitan.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cosmopolitan</a>, due to its not infrequent appearances in Sex &amp; the City, really helped bring cocktail culture into the mainstream. I still think the Cosmopolitan is such a fun drink. It\u2019s got a real sense of theatre to it, the way you light the orange zest in front of the guests \u2026 there\u2019s just something really sexy about it.</p> <p>The thing I love most about cocktails, particularly vodka cocktails, is their versatility. There\u2019s a vodka cocktail for every occasion, from noon till night.</p> <p>Think about it: you\u2019ve got a classic <a href=\"https://www.greygoose.com/en-gb/cocktails/grey-goose-vodka/bloody-mary.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bloody Mary</a> to start the day off at brunch, then for the afternoon there\u2019s a spritz, such as the <a href=\"https://www.greygoose.com/en-gb/cocktails/grey-goose-vodka/grey-goose-le-grand-fizz.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Grey Goose Le Grand Fizz</a>, which is perfect for the daytime, outdoor drinking and having an all-round good time of it. After that comes cocktail hour, when a pre-dinner aperitif is the order, and you can\u2019t beat a <a href=\"https://www.greygoose.com/en-gb/cocktails/grey-goose-vodka/the-grey-goose-martini-cocktail.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dry Martini</a> for that. And finally, of course, there\u2019s the <a href=\"https://www.greygoose.com/en-gb/cocktails/grey-goose-vodka/espresso-martini-cocktail.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Espresso Martini</a> to savour at the end of your meal.</p> <p>Cocktails not only bring people together \u2013 they\u2019re also a great vehicle for expressing your personal taste. Look at a classic <a href=\"https://www.greygoose.com/en-gb/cocktails/grey-goose-vodka/the-grey-goose-martini-cocktail.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dry Martini cocktail</a>. It\u2019s one of the most versatile drinks, with so many different ways of making it your own. Shaken or stirred \u2013 it\u2019s up to you. Dry (which means less vermouth) or wet (which means more) \u2013 that\u2019s your choice. Straight up in a cocktail glass or over ice, there are a multitude of options.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7083c1ee49efb85dbdfdd09f3b971028b8e70052\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7083c1ee49efb85dbdfdd09f3b971028b8e70052/941_555_4054_2433/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joe McCanta pours a cocktail\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"a4e21ba842f3e5c2012818379bf145ae0852df60\"> <img src=\"https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2019/09/23/HalfWidth_Cocktail_GIF_2.gif\" alt=\"gif of cocktails\" width=\"955\" height=\"1196\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"e4a38b8e4eb1d7f72cc2cdb5e19a46439716a6e6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e4a38b8e4eb1d7f72cc2cdb5e19a46439716a6e6/0_149_1155_1443/800.jpg\" alt=\"Blood Orange Margarita With Rosemary And Melting IceBlood orange margarita with sprig of rosemary, orange slices, melting ice cubes and fresh squeezed orange juice on a concrete surface\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I make cocktails for a living and absolutely love entertaining \u2013 but when I have people over to mine for drinks, the last thing I want to be doing is stuck in the kitchen making drinks all night. I\u2019d rather be talking to my friends and enjoying the party! So I\u2019ve developed some nice tricks to help me do that.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/live-victoriously/2019/sep/20/early-afternoon-delight-the-boundless-appeal-of-brunching\">Early afternoon delight: the boundless appeal of brunching</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When I host parties, I\u2019ll put out various bottles of Grey Goose Vodka \u2013 from <a href=\"https://www.greygoose.com/en-gb/products/le-citron.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Grey Goose le Citron</a> to <a href=\"https://www.greygoose.com/en-gb/products/la-poire.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Grey Goose le Poire</a> \u2013 and then a few different citrus fruits, such as lemon, lime or grapefruit. And then some sweet things \u2013 maple syrup, agave, sugar or honey \u2013 plus bottles of tonic and soda.</p> <p>Just by providing those four different options: spirituous, sweet, sour and a lengthener, you can make dozens of different drinks. I\u2019ll tell my guests: \u201cI\u2019m not doing it tonight. Make your own cocktails. Choose your own adventure.\u201d</p> <p>Suddenly people start interacting with one another, and this fun, social cocktail station has become the focal point of the party. It\u2019s a great icebreaker for people who don\u2019t know each another, and it stops someone getting stuck in the kitchen making the same drink over and over again, missing the party.</p> <p>And, contrary to what many people might think, you don\u2019t need special glasses, strainers and shakers to whip up an impressive drink. A mason jar is a great cocktail shaker substitute for mixing drinks in, and for stirred drinks you can use a large jug or pitcher.</p> <p>When it comes to serving them, there\u2019s no substitute for a great cocktail glass \u2013 however you can find loads of beautiful ones at charity shops or car boot sales.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/labs/2019/grey-goose/presse.html\" data-alt=\"Presse recipe\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/labs/2019/grey-goose/presse.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Presse recipe</a> </figure>  <p>No muddler? How about trying the end of a rolling pin? There\u2019s no need for special metal jiggers if you have measuring spoons or even a simple egg cup. I think the biggest barriers people have with making cocktails at home is thinking that they do not have the right equipment or the skills. But neither of these is necessarily true.</p> <p>I always say you should \u201cdrink like you eat\u201d, so if you\u2019re able to prepare a simple meal at home, you definitely have everything you need \u2013 both equipment wise and skillswise \u2013 to make cocktails.</p> <p>The most simple cocktails just need fresh citrus and ice \u2013 there are some simple preparations to do beforehand. Squeeze lemons and limes before people come over \u2013 some people even think that lime juice tastes better after overnight storage in the fridge. Always keep some simple syrup to hand, which is just one part hot water mixed with one part sugar, or a honey syrup with two parts honey to one part hot water.</p> <p>Cocktails are all about simply balancing and tasting, and if you start with a simple base cocktail \u2013 I\u2019d suggest a Grey Goose Press\u00e9 \u2013 you can create a multitude of different flavour combinations easily and quickly.</p> <p>Once you\u2019ve mastered this, the recipe can easily be adapted to make other cocktails, including an orange version \u2013 use Grey Goose L\u2019Orange for extra taste, and orange juice as the citrus juice. Add 1-2 teaspoons of agave syrup and top with grapefruit soda. If you\u2019re feeling adventurous, add in a dash of Martini Bitter.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3e05cea74fcfab752b5fc3961d6716e3fd26cb40\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e05cea74fcfab752b5fc3961d6716e3fd26cb40/154_136_1651_1104/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bottle of Grey Goose vodka with cocktails\" width=\"1000\" height=\"669\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>This is the sort of drink that looks best served with generous amounts of clear ice \u2013 it looks impressive but is so easy to make.</p> <p>Fill some plastic storage containers with filtered or boiled water and freeze overnight. Then empty the whole blocks out in one piece and smash them into ice chunks using a rolling pin or the back of a large spoon.</p> <p>If you only put a few small pieces of ice in a cocktail it will become diluted, as these melt quickly \u2013 using larger chunks of ice will help the drink stay balanced for longer, as they take longer to melt.</p> <p>With these simple tips, it\u2019s easy to bring the drama of the cocktail bar and the social buzz of the cocktail hour into your home when you\u2019re entertaining.</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/stores/node/1720805031?_encoding=UTF8&amp;field-lbr_brands_browse-bin=Grey%20Goose&amp;ref_=bl_dp_s_web_1720805031\" rel=\"nofollow\">Prepare to celebrate moments big and small with Grey Goose Vodka</a></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6d1ff1176514ef44f484abb4b87a4e26c03b69ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6d1ff1176514ef44f484abb4b87a4e26c03b69ae/0_0_620_55/500.png\" alt=\"drinkaware colour transparent\" width=\"500\" height=\"44\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>",

Think about it: you\u2019ve got a classic Bloody Mary to start the day off at brunch, then for the afternoon there\u2019s a spritz, such as the Grey Goose Le Grand Fizz, which is perfect for the daytime, outdoor drinking and having an all-round good time of it. After that comes cocktail hour, when a pre-dinner aperitif is the order, and you can\u2019t beat a Dry Martini for that. And finally, of course, there\u2019s the Espresso Martini to savour at the end of your meal. Cocktails not only bring people together \u2013 they\u2019re also a great vehicle for expressing your personal taste. Look at a classic Dry Martini cocktail. It\u2019s one of the most versatile drinks, with so many different ways of making it your own. Shaken or stirred \u2013 it\u2019s up to you. Dry (which means less vermouth) or wet (which means more) \u2013 that\u2019s your choice. Straight up in a cocktail glass or over ice, there are a multitude of options. I make cocktails for a living and absolutely love entertaining \u2013 but when I have people over to mine for drinks, the last thing I want to be doing is stuck in the kitchen making drinks all night. I\u2019d rather be talking to my friends and enjoying the party! So I\u2019ve developed some nice tricks to help me do that. When I host parties, I\u2019ll put out various bottles of Grey Goose Vodka \u2013 from Grey Goose le Citron to Grey Goose le Poire \u2013 and then a few different citrus fruits, such as lemon, lime or grapefruit. And then some sweet things \u2013 maple syrup, agave, sugar or honey \u2013 plus bottles of tonic and soda. Just by providing those four different options: spirituous, sweet, sour and a lengthener, you can make dozens of different drinks. I\u2019ll tell my guests: \u201cI\u2019m not doing it tonight. Make your own cocktails. Choose your own adventure.\u201d Suddenly people start interacting with one another, and this fun, social cocktail station has become the focal point of the party. It\u2019s a great icebreaker for people who don\u2019t know each another, and it stops someone getting stuck in the kitchen making the same drink over and over again, missing the party. And, contrary to what many people might think, you don\u2019t need special glasses, strainers and shakers to whip up an impressive drink. A mason jar is a great cocktail shaker substitute for mixing drinks in, and for stirred drinks you can use a large jug or pitcher. When it comes to serving them, there\u2019s no substitute for a great cocktail glass \u2013 however you can find loads of beautiful ones at charity shops or car boot sales. No muddler? How about trying the end of a rolling pin? There\u2019s no need for special metal jiggers if you have measuring spoons or even a simple egg cup. I think the biggest barriers people have with making cocktails at home is thinking that they do not have the right equipment or the skills. But neither of these is necessarily true. I always say you should \u201cdrink like you eat\u201d, so if you\u2019re able to prepare a simple meal at home, you definitely have everything you need \u2013 both equipment wise and skillswise \u2013 to make cocktails. The most simple cocktails just need fresh citrus and ice \u2013 there are some simple preparations to do beforehand. Squeeze lemons and limes before people come over \u2013 some people even think that lime juice tastes better after overnight storage in the fridge. Always keep some simple syrup to hand, which is just one part hot water mixed with one part sugar, or a honey syrup with two parts honey to one part hot water. Cocktails are all about simply balancing and tasting, and if you start with a simple base cocktail \u2013 I\u2019d suggest a Grey Goose Press\u00e9 \u2013 you can create a multitude of different flavour combinations easily and quickly. Once you\u2019ve mastered this, the recipe can easily be adapted to make other cocktails, including an orange version \u2013 use Grey Goose L\u2019Orange for extra taste, and orange juice as the citrus juice. Add 1-2 teaspoons of agave syrup and top with grapefruit soda. If you\u2019re feeling adventurous, add in a dash of Martini Bitter. This is the sort of drink that looks best served with generous amounts of clear ice \u2013 it looks impressive but is so easy to make. Fill some plastic storage containers with filtered or boiled water and freeze overnight. Then empty the whole blocks out in one piece and smash them into ice chunks using a rolling pin or the back of a large spoon. If you only put a few small pieces of ice in a cocktail it will become diluted, as these melt quickly \u2013 using larger chunks of ice will help the drink stay balanced for longer, as they take longer to melt. With these simple tips, it\u2019s easy to bring the drama of the cocktail bar and the social buzz of the cocktail hour into your home when you\u2019re entertaining. Prepare to celebrate moments big and small with Grey Goose Vodka",

They judged one joke, I judge three years every single day with him and how he is and his friendship. Nothing more to add. \u201cIt was just a joke. It\u2019s a cartoon and the face is quite similar. The same happened a thousand million times with white people. It\u2019s the same. It was a cartoon. It was just a joke and that\u2019s all. But if the people in the [FA] think it is the opposite then Bernardo and City are open to listen and to say [our] opinion. That is all.\u201d Guardiola does not anticipate the club employing a social media officer to safeguard what players may post. \u201cThat is not going to happen,\u201d he said. \u201cIt [social media] is part of our lives. When I was born there was no internet, social media. If I was 12, 13, 14, 16 I would use it like they use it.\u201d Guardiola brushed off the fact that Gabriel Jesus is unhappy at his limited playing time, after the Brazilian stated this in a recent interview in his homeland. The striker also said there was \u201cno reason to leave City\u201d. The manager said: \u201cHe\u2019s special. I saw the interview and it was perfect. No problem. He was respectful. Of course he wants to play. He\u2019s the No 9 for Brazil. He\u2019s the only striker in the world with this mentality. He plays one second, two minutes, 90 minutes and has to play his best. I understand completely.\u201d Guardiola insisted Sergio Ag\u00fcero was not his first-choice No 9. Jesus has started only one of City\u2019s six Premier League games, though a hamstring problem did rule him out for around a month. \u201cI judge in terms of their different qualities,\u201d he said. \u201cI try to let them play both as much as possible. Both are incredible players.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The man accused of killing 10 people by ploughing his van onto a crowded Toronto sidewalk has admitted that he was a violent misogynist who was radicalized online, in a video that was made public on Friday. Alek Minassian is accused of driving a rental van into a crowd on one of Toronto\u2019s busiest streets, killing 10 pedestrians and injuring 16, in the deadliest act of mass murder in the city\u2019s history. The attack traumatized Canada\u2019s largest city, and cast a spotlight on the so-called \u201cincel\u201d online subculture of men united by sexual frustration and a hatred of women. In a nearly four-hour interview after his arrest, Minassian told police officers that he was virgin who had never had a girlfriend, admitted to using the van as a weapon and said he wanted to inspire more attacks. Asked how he felt about the death of 10 people, he replied: \u201cI feel like I accomplished my mission.\u201d Minassian will be tried in February on 10 charges of first-degree murder, as well as 16 counts of attempted murder. The video, and transcripts of the interview, were made public on Friday after an Ontario judge lifted a publication ban. Families of the victims were shown the video before it was released to the public. During the meandering discussion with Detective Rob Thomas, Minassian said he belonged to an online subculture of sexually frustated men, and described his path towards radicalization, saying he drew inspiration from other men who used violence as a form of retribution for \u201cbeing unable to get laid\u201d. \u201cI know of several other guys over the internet who feel the same way,\u201d he said, adding they are \u201ctoo cowardly to act on their anger\u201d. Clad in a white prison jumpsuit, Minassian told police that his interactions with women left him embarrassed and angry. He described a Halloween party in 2013, where he tried to speak with young women, but was often ignored or laughed at. \u201cI consider myself a supreme gentleman,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cI was angry that they would give their love and affection to obnoxious brutes.\u201d A friend at Toronto\u2019s Seneca College, where Minassian studied software development, first directed him to online message boards for men who identify as \u201cinvoluntary celibates\u201d or \u201cincels\u201d. The group views their inability to meet women as punishment for their status as \u201cbeta-males\u201d and direct their anger at the people with active sex lives who they derisively call \u201cChad\u201d and \u201cStacey\u201d. Minassian claimed to have been in contact with Elliot Rodger, who killed six people and himself in a 2014 the campus at the University of California, Santa Barbara, in 2014. Rodger was a self-described incel who posted deeply misogynist videos and a sprawling online manifesto calling for an \u201coverthrow\u201d of what he said was feminist domination. Minassian told police he was \u201cradicalized\u201d at around the time of Rodger\u2019s attack \u2013 and began to fantasize about starting his own \u201crebellion\u201d. \u201cI was thinking that I would inspire future masses to join me in my uprising as well,\u201d he said. He told police that he decided that a 10ft delivery van \u201cwas the perfect medium size to use as \u2026 my weapon\u201d. While he hadn\u2019t initially chosen Yonge Street as his target \u2013 one of the busiest thoroughfares in Toronto \u2013 he decided it was \u201ctime to go for it\u201d after seeing all of the pedestrians milling about the shops lining the street. \u201cI\u2019m thinking that this is it \u2013 this is the day of retribution,\u201d he told Thomas. The video also revealed how the attack was stopped. \u201cSomeone\u2019s drink got splashed on my windshield, and I was worried that I would crash the van anyways,\u201d said Minassian, explaining why he stopped the vehicle and got out. He then sought out a police officer, hoping to provoke a \u201csuicide by cop\u201d. But Ken Lam, a constable, resisted opening fire on Minassian, even though he repeatedly pretended to draw a weapon. \u201cUnfortunately, he didn\u2019t react,\u201d said Minassian. Minassian\u2019s trial, which will begin in February 2020, will be overseen by only a judge alone. Minassian has admitted to driving the van but has not yet entered a plea. The judge overseeing the case has said that Minassian\u2019s state of mind will be an important part of the trial.",

The scale of the country\u2019s problem was underlined this month when 10 election officials were jailed over corruption, among them the two men with ultimate responsibility for organising elections and monitoring them. In the run-up to another presidential election on Saturday, organisers and campaign managers are claiming that technology may offer the first real solutions to Afghanistan\u2019s perpetual vote fraud problems. Election authorities have put their faith in biometric voter verification machines, already shipped to every polling station to take the fingerprints and photo of every voter and record the time they cast their ballot. Those timestamps and individual voter details \u2013 linked to a national identity card \u2013 should make ballot stuffing extremely difficult, say experts monitoring the poll.

      "bodyText": "The government is to spend \u00a310m on arming more officers with electric stun guns, despite police chiefs and human rights groups voicing strong concerns about the impact the weapons have on trust in the police. The announcement was due to be made at the Conservative party conference but after the Guardian approached the Home Office, the department rushed out a statement on its website. The announcement was welcomed by the Police Federation, which represents rank-and-file officers. It said additional funding could put stun guns into the hands of 10,000 police officers, roughly 10% of the total employed in England and Wales. The move has been criticised by police chiefs, the Guardian understands, and is likely to expose a rift between rank-and-file officers and their superiors, with the former calling for a rollout for years and the latter understood to oppose it. The National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council disputed the figure of 10,000 officers with stun guns, which was also cited by the Home Office. The NPCC said the \u00a310m would also be needed to pay for training, certification and maintenance as well as the weapons themselves. One source with knowledge of discussions said there was a \u201cflurry of activity\u201d last week within the government on stun guns.

Since becoming prime minister, Johnson and his government have attempted to make a hardline approach to criminal justice a central plank of their domestic agenda \u2013 a move denounced as populist by critics. Johnson and his cabinet have made a wave of a justice-focused announcements, including on new prison places, tougher sentencing, increased use of stop and search and more police officers on the streets.

Norbert R\u00f6ttgen, the chair of the Bundestag foreign affairs committee, told Spiegel: \u201cThe crime appears to have considerable and clear political fingerprints.\u201d He said that for reasons he could not comprehend the case had not been passed on to the federal public prosecutor\u2019s office. Zelimkhan Khangoshvili, 40, was shot dead at close range in the Kleiner Tiergarten park while he was on his way to the mosque on 23 August. The suspected killer, named by German police as Vadim Sokolov, which is not thought to be his real name, tried to flee by bicycle but was apprehended by police after passersby had reported seeing him throwing a wig and gun into a river. Police investigators were quick to compare the killing of Khangoshvili to the attempted murder of Sergei Skripal and his daughter in Salisbury by suspected Russian agents last year. The suspect has so far refused to answer police questions. The Berlin prosecutor\u2019s office has described him as \u201cbehaving like a professional\u201d. The journalists\u2019 investigation has found there is no one registered in the Russian passport records office as Vadim Sokolov.

But the team of investigative journalists, with the help of forensic experts at Bradford University, have found no match between photographs of the suspect and Stepanov. There are also reports that Stepanov is in prison. Khangoshvili fought in the second Chechen war against Russia.

The review comes after research published last month suggested optimists had a greater chance of living to a ripe old age than those with a less sunny disposition. The research, which looked at evidence from 15 previously published studies, cannot prove that being optimistic is the driver of better heart health and a lower risk of death. However, the authors note the associations remained even after various other factors that might explain them were considered including education level, whether participants had depression and the amount of exercise they did. They also say there are plausible mechanisms by which optimism might have an effect. The team say the results are interesting since optimism is largely influenced by non-genetic factors, meaning it might be possible to shift people\u2019s mindsets and, potentially, improve their health outcomes \u2013 although that idea is still being researched. Prof Alan Rozanski of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, first author of the research, said boosting optimism meant more than simply telling people to \u201cthink positively\u201d. \u201cWe have multiple ways to help them including [developing skills for] problem solving, developing the muscle of positive thinking through interventions like gratitude, and using cognitive behavioural therapy,\u201d he said.

It could have announced that the nation has banned the death sentence; it could have said it\u2019s not a crime to be homosexual; or it could have just told someone else to host it because it\u2019s a sorry farce the tournament is being held there in the first place. But instead, Qatar did what The Fiver often does when it wants people to like us \u2013 it announced that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/26/alcohol-2022-football-world-cup-qatar\">booze will be freely available</a>!</p> <p>\u201cAlcohol is not part of our culture. However, hospitality is,\u201d cheered Qatar\u2019s official Fun Tsar, Nasser al-Khater. \u201cAlcohol is not as readily available here as in other parts of the world but for the World Cup we want to ensure it is accessible for fans who want to have a drink.\u201d With England having a half-decent side these days and likely to qualify, Doha cafe owners might want to ready themselves for a winter influx of thirsty red-faced folk, including $exually Repressed Morris Dancing Fiver and That Effing Brass Band.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/26/alcohol-2022-football-world-cup-qatar\">Alcohol set to be subsidised and more available at 2022 World Cup in Qatar</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Though whether they will ever get close to drinking enough Tin to get moody is debatable. The price of raising your blood pressure with the frothy stuff in Qatar is an eye-popping \u00a310 a pint. Ordinarily, The Fiver\u2019s advice would be to find an old piece of hosepipe and mainline some petrol from the nearest taxi to lift your spirits, but the word is that Qatar will look to relax the sin tax on alcohol in order to reduce prices to something similar to having a tipple in a trendy London boozer.</p> <p>So, that\u2019s one potential hurdle cleared for sinful, repressed football-following folk looking to have a good time. The other is whether their behaviour once they\u2019ve refreshed themselves is acceptable: public drunkenness is a crime that can be punishable by flogging. To be fair to Khater, he did say that security staff would be trained to accept behaviour they wouldn\u2019t normally put up with, though given that he added that public shows of affection from anyone are \u201cfrowned upon\u201d in Qatar, we\u2019re guessing the tolerance threshold won\u2019t be particularly high. \u201cAs long as people are happy, that\u2019s fine,\u201d honked Dr Fun, who might want to be asked again when he sees a dozen flabby fellas doing a drunken conga through the Mirqab Mall\u2019s luxury fountains while singing Vindaloo.</p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> <p>\u201cPumping out cold air is a bit crude and then God will just make that disappear.

Thankfully Mr Rushden\u2019s subject transpired to be a case of some harmless <em>alternative</em> universe: a universe without VAR as opposed to one with VAR.

      "bodyText": "AT LEAST IT\u2019S NOT KEYESEY ON QATAR There are many ways Qatar could have acted to allay fears that the Human Rights World Cup might be the most joyless event since Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, Graeme Souness and Roy Keane appeared in a TV studio together. It could have announced that the nation has banned the death sentence; it could have said it\u2019s not a crime to be homosexual; or it could have just told someone else to host it because it\u2019s a sorry farce the tournament is being held there in the first place. But instead, Qatar did what The Fiver often does when it wants people to like us \u2013 it announced that booze will be freely available! \u201cAlcohol is not part of our culture. However, hospitality is,\u201d cheered Qatar\u2019s official Fun Tsar, Nasser al-Khater. \u201cAlcohol is not as readily available here as in other parts of the world but for the World Cup we want to ensure it is accessible for fans who want to have a drink.\u201d With England having a half-decent side these days and likely to qualify, Doha cafe owners might want to ready themselves for a winter influx of thirsty red-faced folk, including $exually Repressed Morris Dancing Fiver and That Effing Brass Band. Though whether they will ever get close to drinking enough Tin to get moody is debatable. The price of raising your blood pressure with the frothy stuff in Qatar is an eye-popping \u00a310 a pint. Ordinarily, The Fiver\u2019s advice would be to find an old piece of hosepipe and mainline some petrol from the nearest taxi to lift your spirits, but the word is that Qatar will look to relax the sin tax on alcohol in order to reduce prices to something similar to having a tipple in a trendy London boozer. So, that\u2019s one potential hurdle cleared for sinful, repressed football-following folk looking to have a good time. The other is whether their behaviour once they\u2019ve refreshed themselves is acceptable: public drunkenness is a crime that can be punishable by flogging. To be fair to Khater, he did say that security staff would be trained to accept behaviour they wouldn\u2019t normally put up with, though given that he added that public shows of affection from anyone are \u201cfrowned upon\u201d in Qatar, we\u2019re guessing the tolerance threshold won\u2019t be particularly high. \u201cAs long as people are happy, that\u2019s fine,\u201d honked Dr Fun, who might want to be asked again when he sees a dozen flabby fellas doing a drunken conga through the Mirqab Mall\u2019s luxury fountains while singing Vindaloo. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cPumping out cold air is a bit crude and then God will just make that disappear. So, we pump the exact amount of cold air in the exact place and then recycle it all the time. We never throw it away. There are grills on the floor. We take it from the top and recycle it back\u201d \u2013 Saud Abdul Ghani, aka \u2018Dr Cool\u2019, on Qatar 2022\u2019s cooling technology dealing with temperatures of up to 100F. RECOMMENDED LISTENING The pod squad are here, with Football Weekly Extra. FIVER LETTERS \u201cYour reference to Jimmy Corkhill from Brookside (yesterday\u2019s Fiver) made me wonder how old your youngest reader is (and therefore how many, if any, you alienated with that reference). I\u2019m 46 and willing to bet I\u2019m one of the youngest. Keep up the good, if outdated, work\u201d \u2013 Paul Buller. \u201cOne can only assume from Admir Pajic\u2019s letter on the speeded-up simulation of post-Invincibles Arsenal by modern Spurs (yesterday\u2019s Fiver letters) that he\u2019s managed to forget the dire Big Cup final from a few months ago. Good for him\u201d \u2013 Christopher Smith. \u201c\u2018Max Rushden on VAR and an alternate universe\u2019 (yesterday\u2019s Still Want More?) sounds like a plot for football\u2019s first psychological-horror movie. VAR is challenging enough already, without it constantly flipping between this universe and some other, appearing and disappearing over and over again ad infinitum, like some dodgy electrical appliance on the perpetual blink. Thankfully Mr Rushden\u2019s subject transpired to be a case of some harmless alternative universe: a universe without VAR as opposed to one with VAR. Then it occurred to me that alternative universes might not be so harmless after all, as some of them could be pairs of alternate universes. At which point it occurred to me that I ought to roll all this multiverse stuff into an email and send it straight back to its source\u201d \u2013 Tony Thulborn. Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. And you can always tweet The Fiver via @guardian_sport. Today\u2019s winner of our prizeless letter o\u2019the day is \u2026 Tony Thulborn. BITS AND BOBS Perhaps inspired by Homer the Vigilante, Pep Guardiola keeps on digging when it comes to Bernardo Silva and that tweet to Benjamin Mendy. \u201cThe people who judge Bernardo don\u2019t know him,\u201d parped Pep. \u201cHe is an exceptional person. They judge him on one joke, I judge him on three years working with him every single day.\u201d Granit Xhaka is the new Arsenal captain after a vote among their squad for a five-man senior group. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is vice-captain, followed by H\u00e9ctor Beller\u00edn, Alexandre Lacazette and Leadership\u2019s Mesut \u00d6zil. Football League clubs are insisting that teams be docked points for failing to pay their players. \u201cClubs are fed up with this,\u201d sniffed one chairman. \u201cFines and player embargoes are useless. So is trying to stop bad owners.\u201d While it may be unravelling at speed again for Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r, the Manchester United manager is keeping positive. \u201cI never said it was going be easy this season,\u201d he cooed. \u201cThere are going to be ups and downs, highs and lows. And when we lose a game we have to trust ourselves and what we\u2019re doing.\u201d And the build-up to next week\u2019s all-Brazilian Copa Libertadores semi between Gr\u00eamio and Flamengo is being overshadowed by some dismal rhetoric from the former\u2019s Renato Portaluppi about opposite number Jorge Jesus. \u201cHe\u2019s never trained a big European side outside Portugal, he\u2019s never won anything and he\u2019s 65 years old,\u201d belched Portaluppi about the three-time Primeira Liga winner. STILL WANT MORE? David Hytner hears from an embattled Big Mo\u2019 Pochettino and dissects the club\u2019s current malaise. Supporting Manchester United has become far more exasperating and yet arguably far more interesting, writes Tim de Lisle with glass half-full. \u201cI had to become my own role model.\u201d Turkey women\u2019s captain Didem Karagen\u00e7 on why she considered quitting football. Dani Alves reflects on \u2026 17 years in Europe, what he learned from Pep Guardiola, his experiences of racism and why he\u2019s back in Brazil. Vicky Jepson on aiming to take her Liverpool team back to the top of women\u2019s football. In Russia, but want to watch the likes of Jack Wilshere and Phil Jones? You are likely to be bang out of luck, warns Artur Petrosyan. Oh, and if it\u2019s your thing \u2026 you can follow Big Website on Big Social FaceSpace. And INSTACHAT, TOO!

Born in 1846 in Roscommon, Ireland, he was in Yorkshire by 1860, as the next record shows that at only 14 he was found guilty of embezzlement and sentenced to six months\u2019 hard labour in HMP Wakefield. Ten years later, he spent two days in a workhouse, likely due to unemployment. Entering a workhouse at this time was seen as the ultimate degradation, as conditions in these buildings were so repugnant that it was seen only as an option of last resort.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/searching-for-my-past/2019/sep/19/chris-packham-i-wanted-to-know-how-my-parents-lives-were-shaped\">Chris Packham: 'I wanted to know how my parents' lives were shaped'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There\u2019s a hint of scandal in November 1872, when he marries Annie Rowe, who already had a six-month-old daughter, Mary Rowe. There\u2019s no record of Mary\u2019s exact place of birth, except it was in West Riding in Yorkshire, meaning that there\u2019s a chance that unmarried Annie gave birth inside a local workhouse. The following year there\u2019s a modified record for Mary, this time with Michael named as the father and her surname changed to Moran.</p> <p>In 1888 Annie, by then a mother-of-three, died aged 35. The only record of her death is the date and that it happened in Barnsley.</p> <p>Michael never remarried and in 1901 was living with Mary, her husband John Purcell and their seven children, as a lodger.

He was married to Annie, who would have been pregnant with Ida at the time, and parent to three children under 10. It wasn\u2019t uncommon to be jailed for debt \u2013 nearly 11,500 were in 1910. Nan and Pops One of the most compelling family members I discovered on Ancestry is Annie Wilson\u2019s father, Wayne\u2019s great-great-grandfather, Michael Moran, who was a bricklayer\u2019s labourer. Born in 1846 in Roscommon, Ireland, he was in Yorkshire by 1860, as the next record shows that at only 14 he was found guilty of embezzlement and sentenced to six months\u2019 hard labour in HMP Wakefield. Ten years later, he spent two days in a workhouse, likely due to unemployment. Entering a workhouse at this time was seen as the ultimate degradation, as conditions in these buildings were so repugnant that it was seen only as an option of last resort. There\u2019s a hint of scandal in November 1872, when he marries Annie Rowe, who already had a six-month-old daughter, Mary Rowe. There\u2019s no record of Mary\u2019s exact place of birth, except it was in West Riding in Yorkshire, meaning that there\u2019s a chance that unmarried Annie gave birth inside a local workhouse. The following year there\u2019s a modified record for Mary, this time with Michael named as the father and her surname changed to Moran. In 1888 Annie, by then a mother-of-three, died aged 35. The only record of her death is the date and that it happened in Barnsley. Michael never remarried and in 1901 was living with Mary, her husband John Purcell and their seven children, as a lodger. By 1911, he was 66 and boarding in a household of 18 people, including his daughter and some of her family, while working as a bricklayer\u2019s labourer. He was 68 when he died, in the workhouse infirmary in Barnsley on 12 August 1913. Maureen (second right) at Brubeck\u2019s Cafe It\u2019s the connection to the workhouses that immediately strikes Wayne, when I call a week later. \u201cI\u2019m currently working on a children\u2019s workhouse in Shrewsbury that\u2019s been left to rack and ruin,\u201d he says. \u201cSo that\u2019s a real coincidence.\u201d He was unaware of his family\u2019s criminal records, but the poverty that afflicted them doesn\u2019t surprise him. \u201cI knew they were poor, but I didn\u2019t know about prison and workhouses. My grandparents and mum struggled. Nan scrubbed steps of houses \u2013 that\u2019s where the word scrubber comes from. You don\u2019t do that unless you\u2019re from a hard background.\u201d His voice filled with pride, he adds: \u201cThey all worked ridiculously hard to own a house, and I was the first Hemingway to own a car.\u201d We may have drawn a blank on connections to Ernest Hemingway, but the writer\u2019s words ring true of the other Yorkshire Hemingways: \u201cBut man is not made for defeat. A man can be destroyed but not defeated.\u201d Uncover your story. Discover your backstory by charting your family tree. Start a 14-day free trial at ancestry.co.uk",

      "bodyText": "Thanks for all your comments today. I\u2019m going to leave you with a summary of the afternoon\u2019s main developments: The Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has backed the idea of Jeremy Corbyn becoming a caretaker prime minister, in a bid to secure an extension to the Brexit deadline. She said she agrees with installing the Labour leader as PM through a vote of no confidence in Boris Johnson. The Scottish Lib Dems said Corbyn was too divisive to lead a caretaker government. The Labour MP Jess Phillips says she has received more threats after an incident outside her constituency office on Thursday when a man allegedly tried to smash her windows. She showed Sky News a message that said: \u201cUnless you change your attitude, be afraid, be very afraid.\u201d Labour has condemned the veteran Conservative backbencher Desmond Swayne for defending wearing blackface makeup as an entirely acceptable bit of fun. His comments after Justin Trudeau\u2019s admission he had worn blackface makeup were described by Dawn Butler as \u201canother example of a politician not even trying to understand the history of oppression\u201d. The Labour MP David Lammy has criticised the columnist Brendan O\u2019Neill after he said on BBC Politics Live that the delay to Brexit should have sparked riots. It came after the Times quoted an unnamed senior cabinet minister today who warned the country risked a \u201cviolent, popular uprising\u201d if a second referendum overturned the result of the first. Here is a last post to bring a smile to your face before I wrap up the blog with a summary. My eagle-eyed colleague Mattha Busby writes about an advert on the Working for an MP website posted by the Conservatives in the European Parliament: The Eurosceptic Conservatives and Reformist Group in the European parliament, which includes Conservative MEPs, are recruiting an intern to begin work in Brussels at the European parliament on 1 November for six months, the day after the UK is expected to have left the EU. The successful applicant for the role working for the Conservatives and Reformist Group will receive \u20ac1,500 a month and will work to \u201cnurture the relationship between the group and the party now and beyond Brexit\u201d. It is made up of MEPs from rightwing parties across Europe such as Spain\u2019s Vox, Brother\u2019s of Italy, Poland\u2019s Law and Justice, and Sweden Democrats, and the Tories have previously been criticised for their affiliation with the group. Hugo Dixon, a supporter of the People\u2019s Vote campaign, says that Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s reasoning, that installing Jeremy Corbyn as a caretaker PM after a vote of no confidence in Boris Johnson could secure a Brexit extension, is flawed: Boris Johnson has penned a piece for parliament\u2019s the House magazine ahead of the Conservative party conference saying the UK will leave the EU by 31 October \u201ccome what may\u201d. It does not really add much to the debate as there is no indication of how this will be achieved in light of the Benn Act, which was passed to prevent a no-deal Brexit. He writes: We are leaving the European Union by 31 October come what may. This is absolutely crucial in order to renew and restore trust in our precious democracy. The British people have had enough of waiting; the constant message I hear from the public is that they are tired of delay. By getting on with the job we will unite and re-energise our great United Kingdom. I would much prefer the UK to leave the EU with a deal, and the government I lead is working flat out to do its part to make that happen. We have also stepped up preparations and will be fully prepared to leave without an agreement. Unfortunately, as well as receiving support (see previous post), the Labour MP Jess Phillips has also received more threats overnight. From Sky News: It reads: \u201cUnless you change your attitude, be afraid, be very afraid... wherever you are, keep looking over your shoulder. The person standing behind you may not be friendly. You and your remain friends have been warned.\u201d Ms Phillips said: \u201cThe other thing that happened yesterday is that all day the phones in my Westminster [office] had to eventually be switched off because the line was being jammed with people. \u201cI won\u2019t say what they were shouting because I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s fit for the television, but using words like \u2018traitor\u2019,\u201d the Labour MP added. Asked if she\u2019s had death threats she said: \u201cYeah, lots.\u201d This is Haroon Siddique back at the controls. A positive message from Jess Phillips to resume with. It is about the response to an incident outside her constituency office on Thursday when a man allegedly tried to smash her windows: Following his exchange with the No 10 senior adviser Dominic Cummings yesterday, the Labour MP Karl Turner has issued this statement. The Labour MP David Lammy has criticised the columnist Brendan O\u2019Neill after he said on BBC Politics Live earlier that the delay to Brexit should have sparked riots. It comes after the Times quoted an unnamed senior cabinet minister today who warned the country risked a \u201cviolent, popular uprising\u201d if a second referendum overturned the result of the first, adding that it would only take \u201ca couple of nasty populist frontmen to inspire people\u201d. A new civility awards scheme for politicians has been launched by members of the House of Lords and campaigners, after stormy proceedings in parliament on Wednesday were widely condemned. The annual Civility in Politics prizes will be given out to politicians who have shown courtesy and decency through their work, with categories of bridge-builder of the year and campaigner of the year, political correspondent Kate Proctor reports. Labour peer Lord Wood, one of the figures behind the awards, said: \u201cEveryone agrees that politics in the UK is facing a crisis of trust and a crisis of civility. \u201cAs divisions and bitterness mount in the continuing debates around Brexit, we strongly believe that politics must respond not by mirroring these trends, but by resisting them.\u201d Boris Johnson\u2019s spokesman has insisted the government does not recognise a plan that Sir John Major warned could be used to circumvent the Benn Act, which is aimed at forcing the prime minister to seek a Brexit extension, Heather Stewart and Matthew Weaver report. It comes after the former justice secretary David Gauke insisted ministers could not bypass the Benn law, which he described as \u201cwatertight\u201d. Labour has condemned the veteran Conservative backbencher Desmond Swayne for describing criticism of Justin Trudeau\u2019s admission he had worn blackface makeup as \u201cthe latest absurdity of political correctness\u201d. In a post on his personal blog, the New Forest West MP said there had been no need for the Canadian prime minister to make a \u201ccringing apology\u201d for wearing what Trudeau called racist makeup to a costume party in 2001. \u201cIt was a themed \u2018Arabian Nights\u2019 fancy-dress party for heaven\u2019s sake!\u201d Swayne wrote. \u201cIt comes to something when you can\u2019t dress-up as Aladdin without attracting the opprobrium of the \u2018great and good\u2019. He would have done better to have said it was an entirely acceptable bit of fun and refused to apologise.\u201d Swayne went on: \u201cI once went to a \u2018Blues Brothers\u2019 themed fancy-dress party as James Brown. I went to some trouble to be as authentic as possible. I can assure readers of this column that I have no intention of apologising.\u201d Dawn Butler, Labour\u2019s shadow women and equalities secretary, said the comments were \u201canother example of a politician not even trying to understand the history of oppression\u201d. She said: \u201cThe Tories need to explain what action will be taken against him and whether this took place while he was a government minister.\u201d Trudeau, who is in the midst of a re-election struggle, admitted last week that he could not recall how many times he had worn blackface makeup after footage emerged of a third occasion. Here is some reaction to Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s announcement that she would support Jeremy Corbyn as a caretaker prime minister. The Scottish Liberal Democrat spokeswoman for constitutional relations, Wendy Chamberlain, said: We need a plan that has a whiff of a chance of working. Liberal Democrats will back a temporary government to stop a no-deal Brexit but that cannot be led by the divisive Jeremy Corbyn. The numbers don\u2019t add up. Even Nicola Sturgeon has said that she doesn\u2019t trust him. Jo Swinson is working hard across parties to build a majority at Westminster to stop the damage of Brexit. Anyone who wants to keep Scotland in the UK and the UK in the EU should vote for the Liberal Democrats. Kirstene Hair, Conservative MP for Angus, said: This confirms what many have long suspected \u2013 SNP MPs will happily prop up Jeremy Corbyn in No 10. There is no doubt that Corbyn\u2019s weak stance on indyref2 is a deciding factor for the nationalists. He has already left the door open for a re-run of the 2014 referendum if he becomes prime minister. Only a Conservative government will stand up for those who voted no in what was meant to be a once-in-a-generation event. Elaborating on the SNP leader\u2019s tweet earlier, a spokesman for the party said: The SNP has led the way in ensuring Brexit can be stopped and in bringing parliament back into action after the Tories sought to shut down UK democracy, and we will continue to work with all opposition MPs to stop a no-deal Brexit and call a general election to remove this dangerous and undemocratic prime minister as soon as possible. It is now possible \u2013 if the political will is there \u2013 that parties could come together to ensure that the letter to secure an extension is not left in the hands of Boris Johnson and his cronies, who are determined to find a way to get around the Benn Act, but is instead sent by a temporary caretaker prime minister, who would be in office only as long as is necessary to send the letter, with an election held immediately afterwards. We remain open to all options to achieve the aim of stopping a no-deal Brexit and getting rid of Boris Johnson. The deputy speaker Rosie Winterton has written to her fellow MPs today asking for their support in her effort to become the next Speaker of the House of Commons. She said that she would build on her experience as deputy speaker and seek to be a stabilising, unifying speaker who could help resolve the tensions that have built up in recent times by working with all colleagues in a low-profile, consensus-building way. \u201cWe must learn to disagree better,\u201d she said. The current Speaker, John Bercow, announced this month that he would step down by 31 October, after a decade in the role. Harriet Harman is seen as the frontrunner in the role to succeed him, alongside her fellow Labour MP Lindsay Hoyle, another deputy speaker. Chris Bryant, another Labour MP, is among those also pitching for the position. He has pledged a \u201creturn to the rule book\u201d in what has been described as an anti-Bercow campaign. Good afternoon, Mattha Busby here taking over from Haroon Siddique. This is from PA Media: Nicola Sturgeon has backed the idea of Jeremy Corbyn becoming a caretaker prime minister, in a bid to secure an extension to the Brexit deadline. The Scottish first minister tweeted on Friday that she agrees with the idea of installing the Labour leader as PM through a vote of no confidence in the Conservative administration so he can secure a Brexit extension, before then calling an immediate general election. In response to a tweet making the suggestion, Ms Sturgeon said: \u201cAgree with this. VONC [vote of no confidence], opposition unites around someone for sole purpose of securing an extension, and then immediate general election. \u201cNothing is risk free but leaving Johnson in post to force through no deal \u2013 or even a bad deal \u2013 seems like a terrible idea to me.\u201d The former cabinet minister Amber Rudd has said Boris Johnson\u2019s language \u201cdoes incite violence\u201d. Rudd who quit the cabinet and party earlier this month said she was stunned by his comments about Jo Cox and compared his rhetoric to that of Donald Trump. Johnson, speaking in Essex, defended his description of legislation designed to prevent a no-deal Brexit as \u201csurrender\u201d. He argued that barring such language would have the effect of \u201cimpoverishing debate\u201d. A cross-party initiative has been launched to attempt to counter inflammatory language in parliament by issuing \u201ccivility in politics\u201d awards. The former justice minister David Gauke has dismissed fears, raised by John Major, that the government could bypass a law to force the government to delay Brexit beyond 31 October if no deal is agreed. Gauke, one of 21 Tory rebels fired from the party for supporting the Benn Act said it was \u201cwatertight\u201d. Legal commentators concurred with Gauke\u2019s comments. Responding to Major, the PM\u2019s spokesman said the former prime minister\u2019s suggestion that the government could bypass the Benn Act via the privy council was \u201cnot something that we recognise\u201d. A No 10 source described it as \u201ctotal cobblers\u201d. The court of appeal in Belfast has dismissed an application that the British government\u2019s Brexit policy will damage the Northern Ireland peace process. Three applicants failed in their appeal against a Belfast high court judgment that rejected their challenge against the government\u2019s handling of the Brexit process. Ministers do not know whether there are sufficient medicines, medical supplies or freight capacity to support the NHS if the UK leaves the EU without a deal next month, the National Audit Office has found. Amid mounting concern about the use of inflammatory rhetoric in parliament, a cross-party initiative has been launched to attempt to counter it by highlighting those who refrain from such language. The former cabinet minister Amber Rudd has accused Boris Johnson of inciting violence. She told the Evening Standard: The sort of language I\u2019m afraid we\u2019ve seen more and more of coming out from No 10 does incite violence. It\u2019s the sort of language people think legitimises a more aggressive approach and sometimes violence. She added: \u201cThe casual approach to safety of MPs and their staff is immoral,\u201d and said she was \u201cdisappointed and stunned\u201d by the prime minister\u2019s comments relating to Jo Cox. She said Johnson\u2019s rhetoric reminded her of Donald Trump leading chants of \u201clock her up\u201d against Hillary Clinton. Rudd resigned the Tory whip in solidarity with the 21 Tories who were expelled from the parliamentary party for voting to stop no-deal Brexit. She told the Standard she was considering standing as an independent Conservative. From PA Media, on John Major\u2019s comments: Downing Street says it does not \u201crecognise\u201d fears flagged by Sir John Major that Boris Johnson could circumvent the Benn Act. The former Tory prime minister said an order of council issued by ministers in the privy council could avoid the PM having to comply with a demand by MPs for Brexit to be extended if no deal is in place before 31 October. Asked why ministers such as the international development secretary, Alok Sharma, had not been able to rule out the prospect in interviews, the prime minister\u2019s spokesman said: I\u2019m sure that the fact these comments were going to be made came as a surprise to everyone because it is simply not something that we recognise. A No 10 source said: It is absolute nonsense and (I have) absolutely no idea where he has got it from. Total cobblers. We will not use it [order of council]. You will really have to ask him where he has got these from because it is a mystery to all involved. Boris Johnson has once again defended the language he has used to describe the legislation aimed at blocking a no-deal Brexit. Speaking on a visit to Harlow in Essex, he said: I think the threats against MPs and particularly female MPs are absolutely appalling and we\u2019re doing a lot of work to give MPs the security that they need. But then there\u2019s another question which is: can you use words like \u2018surrender\u2019 to describe a certain act or a certain bill? And, quite frankly, I think that you can and if you say that you can\u2019t then you\u2019re kind of impoverishing the language and impoverishing political debate because, after all, the use of that kind of metaphor has been going on for hundreds of years. More rubbishing from No 10 of John Major\u2019s claim that Boris Johnson could try to use the privy council to prevent any delay to Brexit in the event that no deal has been agreed. From PA Media: The court of appeal in Belfast has dismissed an application that the British government\u2019s Brexit policy will damage the Northern Ireland peace process. Three applicants appealed against a Belfast high court judgment that rejected their challenge against the government\u2019s handling of the Brexit process. One of the applicants was high-profile victims\u2019 campaigner Raymond McCord, whose son was murdered by loyalist paramilitaries in 1997. It comes after the supreme court unanimously ruled that Prime Minister Boris Johnson acted unlawfully in shutting down parliament for five weeks. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman is pleading ignorance in relation to John Major\u2019s accusation that Boris Johnson could seek to bypass the Benn Act via the privy council, according to the Mirror. John Major\u2019s speech is not the only development to raise fears about potential attempts to subvert the Benn Act. City AM reports that the government believes it is able to circumvent the act requiring it to delay Britain\u2019s departure from the EU in the absence of a withdrawal agreement by (irony alert) invoking EU law. The article says: A closely guarded plan known to a small handful of aides would see the government point to the fact that article 50 rests under EU law, while the Benn Act is enshrined in British law. \u201cEuropean law usurps British law,\u201d a source told City AM. \u201cThat means the article 50 deadline trumps the Benn Act.\u201d No 10 has repeatedly said it will comply with the law, while simultaneously insisting the UK will leave the EU by Halloween. This plan could see both seemingly contradictory statements come to fruition. One high-ranking Tory MP described the plan as legal, albeit a \u2018wheeze\u2019. It should be noted that legal experts have said any attempt to subvert the Benn Act would be unlawful. The former justice secretary David Gauke has rejected the idea that ministers can use a loophole to bypass a law which forces Boris Johnson to seek a Brexit extension, my colleague Matthew Weaver writes. Gauke, one of 21 Tory rebels who had the party whip removed for voting for the Benn Act, warned Boris Johnson he would face instant legal challenge if he tried to avoid it. He told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: The Benn Act is watertight. The overwhelming legal consensus is that the courts will declare that the Benn Act is effective, and the government will be forced to comply with it ... I don\u2019t know whether it will be me personally, but if it is necessary for it to be challenged, it will be challenged. And there is time from the 19 October and the 31 October, to go to the courts and ensure that the law is properly applied. The former Brexit secretary David Davis has weighed into the debate on the language used in parliament, defending Boris Johnson\u2019s description of the legislation aimed at blocking no deal as a \u201csurrender bill\u201d. Speaking at a conference in Westminster, Davis said: The effect of the Benn bill is to undermine the government. I deplore the abuse received by MPs (from the public), but it should not be used as an argument for suppressing debate. There are a couple of interesting stories around concerning preparedness for Brexit. This, by my colleague Rajeev Syal, says ministers do not know whether there are sufficient medicines, medical supplies or freight capacity to support the NHS if the UK leaves the EU without a deal next month, the National Audit Office has found. Meanwhile, Schools Week reports that the the Department for Education has denied the existence of preparation plans for a no-deal Brexit that it claimed existed just two months ago. Schools Week reports that when it asked the Education and Skills Funding Agency for details of the \u201cdecisive action\u201d it previously said it had taken, the agency told it that while it had \u201cdiscussed the possible contribution of staff as volunteers to be seconded to other government departments for EU exit preparations, there were no specific plans in place regarding discontinuation of work or the allocation of staff numbers or roles to any particular department\u201d. David Allen Green\u2019s comments (see below) dismissing the idea that the government can get round the Benn Act, echo those made by others. They include Jolyon Maugham QC, a leading lawyer in the fight against Boris Johnson\u2019s prorogation of parliament and Mark Elliot, professor of public law at Cambridge University. The legal commentator David Allen Green has rejected the notion that Boris Johnson could get round the Benn Act via the privy council and says judges would swiftly repudiate any attempt to do so. Here is a link to the full text of John Major\u2019s speech warning that Boris Johnson might try to bypass the law preventing no deal. http://www.johnmajorarchive.org.uk/2015-2/sir-john-majors-speech-at-the-centre-for-european-reform-26-september-2019/ The international development secretary, Alok Sharma, refused to answer this morning when asked how the government could abide by the Benn Act and yet still leave the European Union on 31 October. He told the BBC: I\u2019m not going to set out discussions that have occurred in the privacy of cabinet. We are absolutely going to comply with the law, we are working incredibly hard to get a deal and we will be leaving on 31 October. Sharma also said Johnson was right to label the Benn Act, the \u201csurrender act\u201d. He said: If you look at the fundamentals of what that bill does, it does surrender our ability to have effective discussions with the European Union and it does surrender our ability to be able to walk away from the table if that is what happens. We are surrendering our ability to negotiate effectively with the EU. If you were going into a negotiation with both hands tied behind your back, would you not think it somehow a form of capitulation? In his speech, Major also criticised the language being used by Johnson and others. He said: We abhor the language of division and hate - and words such as \u2018saboteur\u2019, \u2018traitor\u2019, \u2018enemy\u2019, \u2018surrender\u2019, \u2018betrayal\u2019 have no place in our party, our politics, nor in our society. It is emphatically not who we are as a people. And must never be seen as so. Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of the day\u2019s political news. This is Haroon Siddique standing in for Andrew Sparrow. We\u2019re leading today with the news that the former Conservative prime minister John Major has warned that 10 Downing Street\u2019s current incumbent could seek to subvert the Benn Act, which requires the prime minister to seek an extension to the Brexit withdrawal date beyond 31 October if a withdrawal agreement has not been ratified by then. In a speech to the the Centre for European Reform, Major said he feared Boris Johnson could try \u2013 via the privy council \u2013 to bypass the Benn Act by suspending it until after 31 October. He said: My fear is that the government will seek to bypass statute law, by passing an order of council to suspend the act until after 31 October. It is important to note that an order of council can be passed by privy councillors \u2013 that is government ministers \u2013 without involving Her Majesty the Queen. I should warn the prime minister that \u2013 if this route is taken \u2013 it will be in flagrant defiance of parliament and utterly disrespectful to the supreme court. It would be a piece of political chicanery that no one should ever forgive or forget. Major also accused Johnson of \u201cwilfully\u201d destroying the prospects of cross-party agreement on Brexit with his Commons onslaught on the opposition. We\u2019ll be mopping up all the reaction to Major\u2019s speech and covering the other political developments today. If you want to get in touch, the best way is to tweet me at @Haroon_Siddique.",

In most other countries, repeated high-profile losses would almost certainly spell the end of a political career, despite Abdullah\u2019s credentials from years serving with the anti-Soviet and anti-Taliban resistance and later in government.

Some of Abdullah\u2019s team have been with him for years, others are former Ghani supporters \u2013 including one of his 2014 vice-presidential candidates \u2013 who swapped sides because of personal disputes, frustration over how he has distributed the spoils of power, or disillusionment over how he has ruled.

      "body": "<p>I knew Joker was a film whose relationship to society today is a rich \u2013 and sometimes fraught \u2013 one. But until I saw it, I hadn\u2019t realised just how pertinent a film it would be. Set in dystopian Gotham of the 1980s, it\u2019s a world where the vulnerable of society, such as single mothers, the elderly and people with mental health issues are crammed into crumbling housing projects, while super-affluent bankers live it large. The villains in Joker are the filthy rich, such as the bullying, Trump-like Thomas Wayne who blames the poor for their own poverty as he campaigns to become mayor.</p> <p>This is first-person cinema told from the point of view of someone with mental health issues. The character of Arthur Fleck is an authentic and well-researched depiction of a man with borderline personality disorder. At times, it felt less like watching a superhero movie and more like a social drama depicting a real-life horror story of austerity.</p> <p>Played with corporeal commitment by Joaquin Phoenix, Arthur has a neurological condition called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudobulbar_affect\">Pseudobulbar Affect</a>, most straightforwardly explained as spontaneous and uncontrollable laughter at inappropriate moments.

      "bodyText": "I knew Joker was a film whose relationship to society today is a rich \u2013 and sometimes fraught \u2013 one. But until I saw it, I hadn\u2019t realised just how pertinent a film it would be. Set in dystopian Gotham of the 1980s, it\u2019s a world where the vulnerable of society, such as single mothers, the elderly and people with mental health issues are crammed into crumbling housing projects, while super-affluent bankers live it large. The villains in Joker are the filthy rich, such as the bullying, Trump-like Thomas Wayne who blames the poor for their own poverty as he campaigns to become mayor. This is first-person cinema told from the point of view of someone with mental health issues. The character of Arthur Fleck is an authentic and well-researched depiction of a man with borderline personality disorder. At times, it felt less like watching a superhero movie and more like a social drama depicting a real-life horror story of austerity. Played with corporeal commitment by Joaquin Phoenix, Arthur has a neurological condition called Pseudobulbar Affect, most straightforwardly explained as spontaneous and uncontrollable laughter at inappropriate moments. The scene where Arthur is confronted by a woman on a bus who becomes irritated by his laughter is a situation that will be all too familiar to anyone who has experienced firsthand the frustration, misunderstanding and sense of helplessness involuntary mental health conditions can cause. It\u2019s not Arthur who has the problem, though \u2013 it\u2019s an uncaring and misunderstanding society and that\u2019s what this scene brilliantly conveys. Joker puts us in the shoes of the Other, a disabled man oppressed by the able-bodied.

      "bodyText": "The incessant scrutiny and pressure? That is Manchester United\u2019s \u201crightful place\u201d, says a bullish Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r as he prepares for Arsenal\u2019s visit to Old Trafford on Monday. Results may be flatlining, performances diffident and the team possibly without Paul Pogba, yet Solskj\u00e6r breezily contemplates all this after a few days in which United lost at West Ham and scraped past League One Rochdale via penalties in the Carabao Cup. \u201cI don\u2019t worry what the press write about other teams or me and Man United,\u201d the manager says. \u201cWe are focused on what we have to do: to keep improving. Reading the papers doesn\u2019t change my view. Sometimes my kids are asking: \u2018What\u2019s this [criticism] all about?\u2019 \u201cWhen I was a player it was always Man United hogging the headlines. We wouldn\u2019t want to scramble through the newspapers to see if things [might] have been written about us. That\u2019s our rightful place [before the glare]. When we lose a game or go through difficult periods we must keep our eyes on the prize and keep working in the direction we believe.\u201d Solskj\u00e6r has walked into his regular Friday media briefing with a smile that remains throughout. The 46-year-old is, indeed, discovering how the United spotlight allows no escape. One bookmaker has him at 6-1 to be sacked next \u2013 \u201cby Tuesday night\u201d (second behind Everton\u2019s Marco Silva) \u2013 and, if some of the punditry and reporting is as feverish, Solskj\u00e6r is calm enough to offer the following assessment. \u201cI never said it was going be easy this season. There are going to be ups and downs, highs and lows. And when we lose a game we have to trust ourselves and what we\u2019re doing, [keep our] eyes on the prize and keep the principles we believe in. \u201cAny game in the Premier League is winnable but also losable. It\u2019s margins, fine margins and sometimes you stand there smiling happy to have won a game, sometimes angry because you\u2019ve lost. You\u2019ve got to portray the right image.\u201d Since the 4-0 win over Chelsea on the opening day United have scored only four league goals in five games and since Solskj\u00e6r was made permanent manager at the end of March they have 17 goals in 18 matches in all competitions. Combine this with some insipid displays \u2013 the one at West Ham was akin to the dullest under Jos\u00e9 Mourinho and Louis van Gaal \u2013 and a perfect storm for criticism has been created. Yet Solskj\u00e6r says those fans he meets offer a different take. \u201cThey are very, very positive and [say]: \u2018We can see what you\u2019re doing \u2013 keep going,\u2019\u201d he says, before illustrating an awareness of the vagaries of Twitter and other platforms. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to be positive when you meet someone face to face, it\u2019s easy to hide behind social media when negative.

      "body": "<p>History and legend seem to mingle through the breeze in the ancient, waterfront city of Hangzhou. Causeways named for medieval poets wind across its gleaming West Lake to low green hills, as singers and dancers retell the story of the Butterfly Lovers (Hangzhou\u2019s answer to Romeo and Juliet), amid lavish special effects.</p> <p>Bullet trains race to and from this modern city \u2013 home to tech pioneers including Jack Ma, founder of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba \u2013 at speeds up to 350 km/h (217 mph). Yet beyond the pace of 21st-century life, ancient stories echo down the years.</p> <p>And, in a way, that\u2019s no surprise. Perhaps the first distinctively Chinese culture flourished near Hangzhou more than 5,000 years ago. The Liangzhu people built an imperial city, complete with elaborate flood control systems, produced silk, lacquerware, fine ceramics and jade jewellery.

      "bodyText": "History and legend seem to mingle through the breeze in the ancient, waterfront city of Hangzhou. Causeways named for medieval poets wind across its gleaming West Lake to low green hills, as singers and dancers retell the story of the Butterfly Lovers (Hangzhou\u2019s answer to Romeo and Juliet), amid lavish special effects. Bullet trains race to and from this modern city \u2013 home to tech pioneers including Jack Ma, founder of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba \u2013 at speeds up to 350 km/h (217 mph). Yet beyond the pace of 21st-century life, ancient stories echo down the years. And, in a way, that\u2019s no surprise. Perhaps the first distinctively Chinese culture flourished near Hangzhou more than 5,000 years ago. The Liangzhu people built an imperial city, complete with elaborate flood control systems, produced silk, lacquerware, fine ceramics and jade jewellery. Added to the Unesco world heritage list in July this year, the ruined city recently opened to visitors, with its treasures preserved in a landmark museum.

      "body": "<p><strong>My partner of 16 years considers me unreasonable for questioning him over </strong><strong>a \u00a3100 gift</strong><strong> to his son from our joint account</strong><strong>. The money was to get his son\u2019s pension started and </strong><strong>is the latest in a long line of financial contributions to both his sons.</strong></p> <p><strong>My partner and I are in our 60s</strong><strong>; his sons in their 30s. He has a kind and generous nature, but his finances haven\u2019t always supported this characteristic. He won\u2019t </strong><strong>discuss</strong><strong> </strong><strong>it</strong><strong>. I paid off his mortgage </strong><strong>recently and </strong><strong>had already given him a lump sum towards it</strong><strong>. I have also</strong><strong> paid tax </strong><strong>bills and </strong><strong>credit cards</strong><strong> \u2013 but he </strong><strong>hasn\u2019t changed his </strong><strong>spending habits. Although there were no conditions attached to these payments</strong><strong>, they were made on the mutual understanding that they were in both our interests and towards our better future together. I have contributed to large maintenance projects on his house</strong><strong> (which we live in) and towards </strong><strong>daily living costs</strong><strong>. We have never discussed how \u201cequal\u201d this arrangement is, just that things \u201cseem to work out\u201d.</strong></p> <p><strong>Over the course of the relationship, I have supported both his sons in various ways, which has enabled my partner to give money away more freely and without consideration </strong><strong>of how it affects me. </strong></p> <p><strong>I have felt unsettled by this for some time, but finally feel </strong><strong>very aggrieved. I don\u2019t have </strong><strong>children of my own, but I understand a parent\u2019s desire to help their offspring. </strong><strong>I would have no \u2013 or at least less \u2013 objection if these \u201cgifts\u201d </strong><strong>were discussed and decided </strong><strong>on </strong><strong>in a way that didn\u2019t detract from our own needs, lifestyle and plans.</strong></p> <p>It\u2019s not really about the \u00a3100, is it? Because that\u2019s a tiny sum compared with how enormously generous you have been (I took the exact sums out to protect your identity, but they were very large). Seemingly small upsets like this in relationships remind me of the game Jenga, where you remove wooden blocks from a tower one at a time until it collapses: the critical thing that finally brings everything down is just a small piece, but when the whole structure has become unstable, that is all it takes.</p> <p>I wonder if you and your partner have ever talked openly about finances and agreed on these things which matter so much to you? You say that you have a \u201cmutual understanding\u201d but go on to say you have never really discussed things. You need to. You need to give him a chance to air his feelings and put things right, where needed. Try to use \u201cI\u201d statements when you talk to him rather than \u201cYou do this\u201d or \u201cYou do that\u201d. If he won\u2019t talk to you, you need to think carefully about what to do next.

      "bodyText": "My partner of 16 years considers me unreasonable for questioning him over a \u00a3100 gift to his son from our joint account. The money was to get his son\u2019s pension started and is the latest in a long line of financial contributions to both his sons. My partner and I are in our 60s; his sons in their 30s. He has a kind and generous nature, but his finances haven\u2019t always supported this characteristic. He won\u2019t discuss it. I paid off his mortgage recently and had already given him a lump sum towards it. I have also paid tax bills and credit cards \u2013 but he hasn\u2019t changed his spending habits. Although there were no conditions attached to these payments, they were made on the mutual understanding that they were in both our interests and towards our better future together. I have contributed to large maintenance projects on his house (which we live in) and towards daily living costs. We have never discussed how \u201cequal\u201d this arrangement is, just that things \u201cseem to work out\u201d. Over the course of the relationship, I have supported both his sons in various ways, which has enabled my partner to give money away more freely and without consideration of how it affects me. I have felt unsettled by this for some time, but finally feel very aggrieved. I don\u2019t have children of my own, but I understand a parent\u2019s desire to help their offspring. I would have no \u2013 or at least less \u2013 objection if these \u201cgifts\u201d were discussed and decided on in a way that didn\u2019t detract from our own needs, lifestyle and plans. It\u2019s not really about the \u00a3100, is it? Because that\u2019s a tiny sum compared with how enormously generous you have been (I took the exact sums out to protect your identity, but they were very large). Seemingly small upsets like this in relationships remind me of the game Jenga, where you remove wooden blocks from a tower one at a time until it collapses: the critical thing that finally brings everything down is just a small piece, but when the whole structure has become unstable, that is all it takes. I wonder if you and your partner have ever talked openly about finances and agreed on these things which matter so much to you? You say that you have a \u201cmutual understanding\u201d but go on to say you have never really discussed things. You need to. You need to give him a chance to air his feelings and put things right, where needed. Try to use \u201cI\u201d statements when you talk to him rather than \u201cYou do this\u201d or \u201cYou do that\u201d. If he won\u2019t talk to you, you need to think carefully about what to do next. You can\u2019t have a relationship without communication and you are not a bank. There was no mention of your partner\u2019s sons\u2019 mother in all this, and I wonder if their father suffers a certain amount of guilt: it\u2019s almost as if he hasn\u2019t let them launch into adulthood and keeps trying to put things right with them \u2013 why?

Since becoming one of China\u2019s most affluent cities in the 12th century, Hangzhou has delighted visitors and residents alike with its genteel environment and relaxed pace of life. No visit to the city would be complete without exploring some of its impressive natural wonders \u2013 here are five of the most spectacular.</p> <p><strong>West Lake<br></strong>The jewel in Hangzhou\u2019s crown is undoubtedly West Lake, which sits at the heart of the city \u2013 both physically and emotionally. Surrounded on three sides by emerald green hills, West Lake offers Insta-perfect views of quintessential Chinese bridges, teahouses and temples.</p> <p>Over the centuries, many of China\u2019s most famous painters and poets have sought inspiration on its peaceful, willow-fringed banks. Not only is the freshwater lake the subject of hundreds of effusive poems, it in fact owes its legendary good looks to two of China\u2019s most renowned ancient poets \u2013 Bai Juyi (AD 772-846) and Su Dongpo (1037-1101) \u2013 who each took their turn to manage the lake\u2019s development and maintenance. Today, visitors can enjoy the lake\u2019s timeless beauty by walking or cycling across its three causeways or taking a boat ride on its still waters.</p> <p><strong>Prince Bay park<br></strong>Located on the south-west edge of West Lake, Prince Bay park was a royal garden for two Southern Song dynasty princes, Zhuangwen and Jingxian \u2013 both of whom are said to have been buried there. A traditional Chinese landscaped garden, the park features small streams, diverted from nearby West Lake, crossed by graceful bridges.

      "bodyText": "Hangzhou\u2019s tranquil beauty is not just a hit with modern-day visitors; the city has long held almost legendary status in China for both its stunning landscapes and as a place for retreat. Since becoming one of China\u2019s most affluent cities in the 12th century, Hangzhou has delighted visitors and residents alike with its genteel environment and relaxed pace of life. No visit to the city would be complete without exploring some of its impressive natural wonders \u2013 here are five of the most spectacular. West Lake The jewel in Hangzhou\u2019s crown is undoubtedly West Lake, which sits at the heart of the city \u2013 both physically and emotionally. Surrounded on three sides by emerald green hills, West Lake offers Insta-perfect views of quintessential Chinese bridges, teahouses and temples. Over the centuries, many of China\u2019s most famous painters and poets have sought inspiration on its peaceful, willow-fringed banks. Not only is the freshwater lake the subject of hundreds of effusive poems, it in fact owes its legendary good looks to two of China\u2019s most renowned ancient poets \u2013 Bai Juyi (AD 772-846) and Su Dongpo (1037-1101) \u2013 who each took their turn to manage the lake\u2019s development and maintenance. Today, visitors can enjoy the lake\u2019s timeless beauty by walking or cycling across its three causeways or taking a boat ride on its still waters. Prince Bay park Located on the south-west edge of West Lake, Prince Bay park was a royal garden for two Southern Song dynasty princes, Zhuangwen and Jingxian \u2013 both of whom are said to have been buried there. A traditional Chinese landscaped garden, the park features small streams, diverted from nearby West Lake, crossed by graceful bridges. Romantics flock to the park in spring, when thousands of colourful tulips and snow-white cherry blossoms make the perfect backdrop for wedding photos and ceremonies. Cherry blossom in Prince Bay park Tea plantations Hangzhou\u2019s hundreds of teahouses owe their supply of fine green tea to the acres of plantations that cover the hills to the west of the city; its famed longjing green tea has been cultivated in the area for more than 1,000 years, thanks to the fertile soil, mild climate, and abundant supply of fresh water. As well as producing one of the world\u2019s best green teas, the plantations are also home to hiking trails and natural caves, and offer stunning vistas out over the city. During spring \u2013 the best time to visit the plantations \u2013 straw-hatted workers pick tea leaves by hand, while baskets of fresh leaves are left out to dry in the sun. After a day spent exploring, slow down and contemplate life\u2019s big questions at the small family-run teahouses that dot the hills. It\u2019s said that Jack Ma, famous Hangzhou resident and CEO of Chinese tech giant, Alibaba, made many important business decisions in the city\u2019s teahouses in the early days of his company. The Longjing tea plantations to the west of the city offer hiking trails, natural caves and spectacular views Xixi wetland park While West Lake is famed for its carefully cultivated charms, Xixi wetland park offers a slightly less manicured beauty. The area dates back 1,800 years to the Han dynasty and has long been home to farmers and fishermen.

But it cannot be the whole story - arch-rival Tui has coped because its finances are healthier.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Weather</b><br>The summer heatwave of 2018 encouraged would-be holidaymakers to stay at home, undermining prices in the \u201clates\u201d market where operators try to clear unsold holidays. There seems to have been a hangover into 2019, with customers calculating that waiting to book is a productive strategy.</p>\n    <p><b>Competition</b><br>A pincer movement of Airbnb and budget holidays has changed consumer behaviour, though Thomas Cook still managed to sell 11m package holidays last year.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Banks and debt</b><br>The tour operator has been attempting to shoulder a&nbsp; huge pile of debt for the past decade \u2013 \u00a31.7bn worth at the last count. Successive managements failed to remove meaningful chunks. The banks argue they have supported an overstretched company for years and the details of why it could not be saved may have to await the report from the Insolvency Service.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Bad management</b><br>Thomas Cook\u2019s borrowings were too high. The moral of the tale is that tour operators should fund themselves conservatively.

Until this week, a quarter of all the tourists coming to the islands came with Thomas Cook. Spain\u2019s general union of workers (UGT) has warned that the fallout could <a href=\"http://canarias.ugt.org/es/noticias/369-ugt-canarias-alerta-que-el-cierre-de-thomas-cook-afecta-a-la-estabilidad-laboral-de-mas-del-10-de-los-trabajadores-del-sector-de-la-hosteleria-en-canarias\">affect the jobs of 10% of hospitality workers in the Canaries</a>.</p> \n<p>As the islands gear up for the usually lucrative winter season, some hotels are wondering how to fill their rooms \u2013 or whether they can be filled at all.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re up against one of the biggest economic crises that the Canaries have faced,\u201d says Melisa Rodr\u00edguez, a Tenerife MP for the centre-right Citizens party. \u201cSixty percent of the tourist places we offer are contracted through tour operators, and Thomas Cook is the second biggest tour operator. We could be talking about an 8% drop in GDP, which would be a very heavy economic blow.\u201d</p> \n<p>Rodr\u00edguez points to one hotel chain that has lost 10,000 of the 14,000 bookings it had for December, adding that up to 12,000 jobs could be lost across the Canaries.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/24/businesses-thomas-cook-fail-executives-ignore-brutal-facts-bonus\">Yes, businesses fail.

      "bodyText": "Under a late September sun that blisters white northern European skin with ease, Playa de las Am\u00e9ricas offers its visitors a bounteous blend of the familiar and the exotic. On the palm-lined main thoroughfare of the Tenerife resort town, tourists have an array of choice, from buying a pint for \u20ac1.50 (\u00a31.33) to watching football matches, taking jetski trips and even Harley-Davidson tours of the island. Altogether less abundant is any clarity as to what the collapse of Thomas Cook could mean for the town, the Canary Islands and the wider Spanish tourist industry. While much of this week\u2019s news has focused on tired, patient Brits queuing in airports to clamber on to planes carrying out the UK\u2019s biggest peacetime repatriation, worry has been growing over what the tour giant\u2019s demise will mean for the thousands of men and women it employed, directly or indirectly. Tourism accounts for almost 12% of Spain\u2019s GDP; in the Canaries, that figure rises to more than 35%. Until this week, a quarter of all the tourists coming to the islands came with Thomas Cook. Spain\u2019s general union of workers (UGT) has warned that the fallout could affect the jobs of 10% of hospitality workers in the Canaries. As the islands gear up for the usually lucrative winter season, some hotels are wondering how to fill their rooms \u2013 or whether they can be filled at all. \u201cWe\u2019re up against one of the biggest economic crises that the Canaries have faced,\u201d says Melisa Rodr\u00edguez, a Tenerife MP for the centre-right Citizens party. \u201cSixty percent of the tourist places we offer are contracted through tour operators, and Thomas Cook is the second biggest tour operator. We could be talking about an 8% drop in GDP, which would be a very heavy economic blow.\u201d Rodr\u00edguez points to one hotel chain that has lost 10,000 of the 14,000 bookings it had for December, adding that up to 12,000 jobs could be lost across the Canaries. \u201cThis could hit the Canaries harder than other Spanish regions not just because of our reliance on tour operator business but also because the high season in the Balearics and elsewhere is over,\u201d she says. \u201cThey can negotiate when it comes to debts and pursue them but the high season in the Canaries is beginning now.\u201d Staff \u2013 including waiters, cleaners, chambermaids, cooks, coach drivers and maintenance workers \u2013 are still waiting to see how Thomas Cook\u2019s disappearance will affect them. Jes\u00fas Miguel Delgado del Rosario has worked as a pool maintenance man at the Gran Hotel Turquesa Playa in the north of Tenerife for the past 13 years. Like many of his colleagues, he can do little but watch and wait. \u201cThey\u2019re tallying up all the winter reservations at the moment,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of worry because Thomas Cook was a big company that had a number of subsidiaries. There\u2019s uncertainty: we\u2019re just waiting to see what happens with all the winter reservations. Yesterday they said that bookings from Germany will be down, too, so it was a bit of a bombshell.\u201d If new guests can\u2019t be found to make up the shortfall, says the 47-year-old worker, staff cuts look all but certain. \u201cBut we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen. We just want more information.\u201d Even if, as many have argued, Thomas Cook\u2019s fall was inevitable, no one seems to have warned the islanders, who are already dealing with high unemployment rates and the appalling uncertainty over Brexit. Ignacio L\u00f3pez, the secretary general of the services federation of the giant workers commissions union, is blunt: \u201cThis is all new to us. We\u2019ve never seen anything like this before, never seen the fall of a tour operator as big as Thomas Cook.\u201d He says Thomas Cook was the only operator with which a lot of hotels worked \u2013 not least because it could give them a guaranteed occupancy rate of 70%. As Thomas Cook pays hotels three months on, debt has been added to uncertainty. \u201cThe consequences for the sector are going to be dramatic but we think business leaders here will be able to weather them,\u201d says L\u00f3pez. Gladys Medina, a chambermaid who also works for the union\u2019s services federation in Tenerife, says that although figures remain elusive, the collapse is already starting to bite. \u201cWe can\u2019t quantify the losses or damages when it comes to people\u2019s jobs because it\u2019s still all very recent, she says. \u201cBut we know that people are already having their contracts ended or frozen and we also know that measures are being taken to get rid of department heads or those in higher salaries to reduce labour costs.\u201d The Canaries are not the only region feeling the pressure: authorities in Mallorca are expecting to lose 25,000 tourists in October and there is also uncertainty in Greece, Cyprus, Turkey and Tunisia. Spain\u2019s acting government \u2013 which is currently gearing up for the country\u2019s fourth election in as many years while also preparing for a no-deal Brexit \u2013 has set up an inter-ministerial committee to respond to the situation and to try to minimise Spain\u2019s exposure. But whatever happens, it needs to happen soon. Many of those who wash towels, clean rooms and cook enormous full English breakfasts in Tenerife and beyond are doing so in a state of increasing anxiety. \u201cPeople are really worried about what could happen and are thinking about who\u2019s going to get fired,\u201d says M\u00f3nica Garc\u00eda, the local president of Kellys union, which campaigns to improve chambermaids\u2019 rights. \u201cThey\u2019re just waiting. And it\u2019s not just chambermaids: everyone depends on tourism and everyone\u2019s going to be affected.

They were meant to be a living embodiment of the royal arms of England, and the tower seemed a suitably fortified place to put them. Over the years, the royal collection grew to include elephants, rhinos, hyenas and a polar bear from Norway that was kept on a leash so long that it could catch fish from the Thames. It lasted until the Zoological Society of London was established in 1826, and the animals moved to the slightly more humane surrounds of London zoo in Regent\u2019s Park.</p> <p>With the birth of the modern zoo came the dawn of zoo architecture, spawning a peculiar kind of building that had to combine the roles of prison, theatre and museum. Over the years, there have been elaborate Sumatran temples for tigers, <a href=\"https://www.zsl.org/zsl-london-zoo/news/foster-partners-to-restore-iconic-snowdon-aviary-to-glory\">aviaries for exotic birds</a> with all-but-invisible nets, and a range of equally eye-catching attempts to break down the barrier between human and animal.

Meuser, an architect and professor, aims to redress this balance and provide guidance for future zoos. She began researching the topic a decade ago, when a toy manufacturer asked her to design some typical zoo structures to go with its animal figures, a task less straightforward than she imagined.</p> <p>\u201cThere wasn\u2019t a simple answer,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I became fascinated by how the architecture of zoos reflected man\u2019s changing relationship with animals: going from a sense of exoticism and wonder, to better hygiene and animal welfare, to the idea that the architecture should disappear altogether.\u201d<br><br>Her book traces the origins of the zoo, from the villas of Roman senators, whose copious estates featured banqueting pavilions where guests could dine in safety while surrounded by wild beasts, to the bear pits and stag trenches of the middle ages, to the lavish royal menageries of the baroque era. None surpassed Louis XIV\u2019s at Versailles, designed as a radial complex of enclosures with <a href=\"http://partylike1660.com/la-menagerie-royale-de-versailles/\">the king\u2019s pavilion at the </a><a href=\"http://partylike1660.com/la-menagerie-royale-de-versailles/\">centre</a>, reflecting his notion of himself as master of the natural world.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"152f25f1b1fecc8a1c64113e5e75c0a5180c1356\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/152f25f1b1fecc8a1c64113e5e75c0a5180c1356/0_0_6144_4089/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tiger overhead \u2026 Philadelphia zoo\u2019s Big Cat Crossing.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tiger overhead \u2026 Philadelphia zoo\u2019s Big Cat Crossing.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: National Geographic Image Collection/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The focus shifted from entertainment to scientific study in the 19th century, with the emergence of zoological gardens in Europe. Creatures were housed in exotically styled pavilions, in the manner of a world\u2019s fair, cementing the zoo as part of the colonial project \u2013 often complete with indigenous humans transported from their homelands to be displayed alongside the animals.</p> <p>Berlin took things to a different level: its zoo was transformed into <a href=\"https://www.zoo-berlin.de/en/about-the-zoo/history-zoo-berlin\">an architectural theme park</a>, with elephants housed in a Hindu temple, antelopes in a Moorish palace and ostriches reached through a momentous Egyptian portal, every detail conceived as part of the total work of art. As Ludwig Heck, the zoo\u2019s pro-Nazi director, put it: \u201cNothing is so negligible that it can\u2019t be artistically transformed.\u201d This thought extended to the thatched-roof huts of his <a href=\"https://brewminate.com/colonial-exhibitions-volkerschauen-and-the-display-of-the-other/\">barbaric human enclosures</a>.<br><br>A backlash against themed pavilions led to a more naturalistic approach, switching the focus from anatomical spectacle to natural behaviour. The wild animal trader and circus impresario Carl Hagenbeck emerges as the godfather of the modern zoo, the first to propose enclosures without bars, realising his \u201cpanorama zoo\u201d concept in Stellingen, near Hamburg, in 1907. He conducted tests on exactly how high each predator could jump (by tying a stuffed pigeon to a branch three metres up) and displayed them accordingly.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6f49b73fdbf44d7b084d3908e5e531fa01e0029f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6f49b73fdbf44d7b084d3908e5e531fa01e0029f/0_0_3542_2516/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Without bars \u2026 Carl Hagenbeck\u2019s Hamburg \u2018panorama zoo\u2019, c 1920.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"710\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Without bars \u2026 Carl Hagenbeck\u2019s Hamburg \u2018panorama zoo\u2019, c 1920.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ullstein bild via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His zoo involved supposedly natural landscapes, separated from visitors by sunken trenches, moats and landscaped berms. The viewer assumed the role of Adam in the Garden of Eden, with mouflon and ibexes on artificial mountains, steppe animals on wide open ranges, and big cats in ravines without bars. An enthusiastic Thomas Edison visited in 1911. \u201cThe animals are not in a cage,\u201d wrote the scientist gleefully in the guestbook. \u201cThey are on a stage!\u201d<br><br>Taking a similar approach, French zoologist Gustave Loisel proposed a plan for a zoo in 1908 in which visitors would be <a href=\"https://www.leszoosdanslemonde.com/about/img/anniversaire_leszoosdanslemonde_2012_loisel.jpg\">hidden beneath an enormous landscaped hill</a>, with the animals roaming above. People would make their way through a network of tunnels inside his artificial mound, all the way into the most intimate parts of the enclosures, getting an up-close glimpse of the animals \u2013 who, in theory, would be unaware of the subterranean voyeurs. \u201cNothing has really changed in zoo architecture since then,\u201d says Meuser. \u201cThe ultimate goal is still for the people to be invisible and the animals to have a sense of freedom.\u201d</p> <p>More than a century later, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/feb/10/bjarke-ingels-design-serpentine-pavilion-julia-peyton-jones\">Danish architect Bjarke Ingels</a> recycled Loisel\u2019s proposal, creating a grand plan for a \u201cZootopia\u201d in Jutland. Unveiled in 2014 with characteristic chutzpah, the proposal was presented as a radical new zoo concept, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/architecture-design-blog/2014/aug/05/denmark-cage-free-zoo-will-put-humans-in-captivity\">where the animals would roam free and humans would be swept beneath a landscaped carpet</a>. As the Guardian put it: \u201cCage-free zoo will put humans in captivity.\u201d Visitors would be able to spy on creatures from hidden dens inside log piles, or trundle around enclosures in mirrored pods. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e7de24f8ce6d9efc9b70d17f7262c2624ad889ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e7de24f8ce6d9efc9b70d17f7262c2624ad889ae/0_0_3500_1750/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chutzpah \u2026 a drawing for \u2018Zootopia\u2019 in Jutland, Denmark.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chutzpah \u2026 a drawing for \u2018Zootopia\u2019 in Jutland, Denmark.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Big</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ingels recently completed <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/12/arts/design/copenhagen-zoo-pandas-china.html\">a \u00a320m panda enclosure for Copenhagen zoo</a>, based on the cliched form of a yin-yang symbol. Meuser thinks it leaves the pandas too exposed, with little chance of hiding, suggesting that Ingels\u2019 vision of an animal-centric zoo revolution is still a long way off.</p> <p>Meuser believes the recent emergence of \u201centertainment architecture\u201d has been damaging, with zoos following attractions such as Disneyland by introducing of themed restaurants and shops to complement every enclosure, placing more emphasis on visitor experience than animal welfare. She quotes veteran US <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/jul/06/featuresreviews.guardianreview8\">zoo director David Hancocks</a>: \u201cThe main difference from a century ago is a new look, which is essentially superficial, and is typically a peculiar distortion of the natural world \u2026 a design vernacular best described as Tarzanesque. Modern zoos often resemble a Hollywood version of Africa on a B-movie set.\u201d</p> <p>Future zoo directors should have no qualms about demolishing these flimsy stage sets. The precious modernist architectural heritage that many zoos boast has proved to be an albatross around their necks. Berthold Lubetkin\u2019s renowned 1934 penguin pool at London zoo has stood empty for 15 years, <a href=\"http://camdennewjournal.com/article/unhappy-feet-lubetkin-daughters-sadness-at-iconic-penguin-pool-left-unused\">after the penguins contracted bumblefoot</a>, a bacterial infection caused by walking on the concrete ramps.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ca3d33de8fe7a7c974297a5b9f81258cf01596b9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca3d33de8fe7a7c974297a5b9f81258cf01596b9/0_0_3508_1754/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A rendering of a zoo proposed for St Petersburg \u2026 a series of islands surrounded by water and dotted with biospheres.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A proposal for St Petersburg \u2026 a series of islands surrounded by water and dotted with biospheres.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Artefactory ZSP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Similarly, the zoo\u2019s brutalist elephant house, designed by Hugh Casson and Neville Conder in 1965 to evoke a herd of elephants gathered around a watering hole, was soon deemed too cramped for the majestic beasts. <a href=\"https://londonist.com/2015/07/listed-buildings-and-architecture-at-london-zoo\">It\u2019s one of 10 </a><a href=\"https://londonist.com/2015/07/listed-buildings-and-architecture-at-london-zoo\">Grade</a><a href=\"https://londonist.com/2015/07/listed-buildings-and-architecture-at-london-zoo\">-I and -II listed monuments</a> the zoo is forced to work around, with little scope for adaptation.</p> <p>Meuser says elephants pose one of the biggest dilemmas for modern zoos. Their immense size, and the fact they thrive in numbers and prefer to gather their own food, make them unhappy captives \u2013 yet they remain the biggest crowd-pullers.

      "bodyText": "Monkeys swinging through assault courses, tigers prowling along caged walkways in the sky, polar bears taking centre stage in a giant copy of a Yukon harbour as crowds look on from a simulated boat deck \u2013 the architecture of zoos seems to have come a long way since the king of England first locked a bunch of lions in the Tower of London and charged the public a few hand-hammered pennies to see them. But has it left the 13th century far enough behind? The Tower of London\u2019s grim menagerie, which entertained paying punters for an astonishing 600 years, came into being after Henry III received three lions as a gift from the Holy Roman Emperor in 1235. They were meant to be a living embodiment of the royal arms of England, and the tower seemed a suitably fortified place to put them. Over the years, the royal collection grew to include elephants, rhinos, hyenas and a polar bear from Norway that was kept on a leash so long that it could catch fish from the Thames. It lasted until the Zoological Society of London was established in 1826, and the animals moved to the slightly more humane surrounds of London zoo in Regent\u2019s Park. With the birth of the modern zoo came the dawn of zoo architecture, spawning a peculiar kind of building that had to combine the roles of prison, theatre and museum. Over the years, there have been elaborate Sumatran temples for tigers, aviaries for exotic birds with all-but-invisible nets, and a range of equally eye-catching attempts to break down the barrier between human and animal. It\u2019s a rich, strange history that has gone mostly undocumented \u2013 until now. \u201cI was amazed by how little literature and discussion there has been,\u201d says Natascha Meuser, author of a weighty new tome, Zoo Buildings: Construction and Design Manual. Meuser, an architect and professor, aims to redress this balance and provide guidance for future zoos. She began researching the topic a decade ago, when a toy manufacturer asked her to design some typical zoo structures to go with its animal figures, a task less straightforward than she imagined. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a simple answer,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I became fascinated by how the architecture of zoos reflected man\u2019s changing relationship with animals: going from a sense of exoticism and wonder, to better hygiene and animal welfare, to the idea that the architecture should disappear altogether.\u201d Her book traces the origins of the zoo, from the villas of Roman senators, whose copious estates featured banqueting pavilions where guests could dine in safety while surrounded by wild beasts, to the bear pits and stag trenches of the middle ages, to the lavish royal menageries of the baroque era. None surpassed Louis XIV\u2019s at Versailles, designed as a radial complex of enclosures with the king\u2019s pavilion at the centre, reflecting his notion of himself as master of the natural world. The focus shifted from entertainment to scientific study in the 19th century, with the emergence of zoological gardens in Europe. Creatures were housed in exotically styled pavilions, in the manner of a world\u2019s fair, cementing the zoo as part of the colonial project \u2013 often complete with indigenous humans transported from their homelands to be displayed alongside the animals. Berlin took things to a different level: its zoo was transformed into an architectural theme park, with elephants housed in a Hindu temple, antelopes in a Moorish palace and ostriches reached through a momentous Egyptian portal, every detail conceived as part of the total work of art. As Ludwig Heck, the zoo\u2019s pro-Nazi director, put it: \u201cNothing is so negligible that it can\u2019t be artistically transformed.\u201d This thought extended to the thatched-roof huts of his barbaric human enclosures. A backlash against themed pavilions led to a more naturalistic approach, switching the focus from anatomical spectacle to natural behaviour. The wild animal trader and circus impresario Carl Hagenbeck emerges as the godfather of the modern zoo, the first to propose enclosures without bars, realising his \u201cpanorama zoo\u201d concept in Stellingen, near Hamburg, in 1907. He conducted tests on exactly how high each predator could jump (by tying a stuffed pigeon to a branch three metres up) and displayed them accordingly. His zoo involved supposedly natural landscapes, separated from visitors by sunken trenches, moats and landscaped berms. The viewer assumed the role of Adam in the Garden of Eden, with mouflon and ibexes on artificial mountains, steppe animals on wide open ranges, and big cats in ravines without bars. An enthusiastic Thomas Edison visited in 1911. \u201cThe animals are not in a cage,\u201d wrote the scientist gleefully in the guestbook. \u201cThey are on a stage!\u201d Taking a similar approach, French zoologist Gustave Loisel proposed a plan for a zoo in 1908 in which visitors would be hidden beneath an enormous landscaped hill, with the animals roaming above. People would make their way through a network of tunnels inside his artificial mound, all the way into the most intimate parts of the enclosures, getting an up-close glimpse of the animals \u2013 who, in theory, would be unaware of the subterranean voyeurs. \u201cNothing has really changed in zoo architecture since then,\u201d says Meuser. \u201cThe ultimate goal is still for the people to be invisible and the animals to have a sense of freedom.\u201d More than a century later, Danish architect Bjarke Ingels recycled Loisel\u2019s proposal, creating a grand plan for a \u201cZootopia\u201d in Jutland. Unveiled in 2014 with characteristic chutzpah, the proposal was presented as a radical new zoo concept, where the animals would roam free and humans would be swept beneath a landscaped carpet. As the Guardian put it: \u201cCage-free zoo will put humans in captivity.\u201d Visitors would be able to spy on creatures from hidden dens inside log piles, or trundle around enclosures in mirrored pods. Ingels recently completed a \u00a320m panda enclosure for Copenhagen zoo, based on the cliched form of a yin-yang symbol. Meuser thinks it leaves the pandas too exposed, with little chance of hiding, suggesting that Ingels\u2019 vision of an animal-centric zoo revolution is still a long way off. Meuser believes the recent emergence of \u201centertainment architecture\u201d has been damaging, with zoos following attractions such as Disneyland by introducing of themed restaurants and shops to complement every enclosure, placing more emphasis on visitor experience than animal welfare. She quotes veteran US zoo director David Hancocks: \u201cThe main difference from a century ago is a new look, which is essentially superficial, and is typically a peculiar distortion of the natural world \u2026 a design vernacular best described as Tarzanesque. Modern zoos often resemble a Hollywood version of Africa on a B-movie set.\u201d Future zoo directors should have no qualms about demolishing these flimsy stage sets. The precious modernist architectural heritage that many zoos boast has proved to be an albatross around their necks. Berthold Lubetkin\u2019s renowned 1934 penguin pool at London zoo has stood empty for 15 years, after the penguins contracted bumblefoot, a bacterial infection caused by walking on the concrete ramps. Similarly, the zoo\u2019s brutalist elephant house, designed by Hugh Casson and Neville Conder in 1965 to evoke a herd of elephants gathered around a watering hole, was soon deemed too cramped for the majestic beasts. It\u2019s one of 10 Grade-I and -II listed monuments the zoo is forced to work around, with little scope for adaptation. Meuser says elephants pose one of the biggest dilemmas for modern zoos. Their immense size, and the fact they thrive in numbers and prefer to gather their own food, make them unhappy captives \u2013 yet they remain the biggest crowd-pullers. One baby elephant can double a zoo\u2019s annual visitor numbers. London zoo (except for Whipsnade) San Francisco, Seattle and Chicago zoos, to name just a few, have all recently given up on keeping elephants. The book\u2019s survey of 50 international zoo buildings built in the last 20 years picks out Norman Foster\u2019s overblown elephant house in Copenhagen as a place \u201cwhere the animal competes for attention with the building in which it lives\u201d. Meanwhile, Zurich\u2019s great domed elephant enclosure, by Markus Schietsch, is highlighted for its more pachyderm-friendly approach. The creation includes more than 40 \u201cfodder depots\u201d hidden around the 11,000-sq-metre enclosure to encourage the elephants to forage, along with various pools where the creatures can wallow. There\u2019s even a self-service shower to reduce contact with keepers. While the book is full of such best-practice models, even the boldest proposals \u2013 like the series of islands, each housing creatures from a different continent, surrounded by water and dotted with biospheres imagined for St Petersburg \u2013 feel like strange anachronisms, curious relics from a bygone age. As Hancocks has pointed out, zoos\u2019 claims of existing for conservation and education are questionable: the main priority is still the display of charismatic \u201cmegafauna\u201d for visitors to gawp at. A growing awareness of captivity-related problems \u2013 including malnutrition, repetitive activity \u201czoochosis\u201d and even cannibalism \u2013 has caused a number of zoos around the world to close.

We are challenging the current access arrangements to parking with the management agents.\u201d</p> \n<p>Between them the affordable and social homes are paying around \u00a336,000 a year in service charges.

      "bodyText": "Disabled children and former Grenfell residents are among social housing tenants being blocked from communal gardens, entrances and a car park on a multimillion-pound development in west London. Guardian Cities has learned that the housing association Octavia blocks access to the communal gardens of Westbourne Place in Maida Vale for social and affordable housing residents in order to avoid the tenants facing the \u201cfinancial burden\u201d of high service charges. Service charges were originally set by the developer Redrow and are now managed by Pinnacle Property Management who run the private side of the development. Redrow\u2019s original plans for the luxury flats, as approved by Westminster council, appear to show open access to the gardens for all who lived there. The plans are now the subject of an enforcement investigation by council officers. Redrow \u2013 who have now sold the freehold \u2013 marketed the homes, which were sold at around \u00a3750,000 as \u201cstatement living at its best\u201d. A fob-controlled gate stops social and shared ownership residents entering the gardens, while private owners have fobs which allow access across the whole development. The affordable and social residents, who pay over \u00a3200 a month service charge per home, have told the Guardian they feel the situation is unjust and discriminatory. One family with a disabled child say they have been fighting for much needed parking access from Pinnacle for several months. The news comes despite widespread outrage sparked by a Guardian Cities investigation in March that discovered children living in social housing in Lambeth were banned from using a communal play area. After follow-up stories revealed the full extent of the problem across London, mayor Sadiq Khan announced a ban on segregated playgrounds in all future developments, describing them as morally unacceptable. The then-housing minister, James Brokenshire, announced he would like to see all forms of housing segregation driven out across Britain. Hamid Ali Jafari lost his 82-year-old father, Ali Yawar Jafari, in the Grenfell Tower blaze. Together with his mother, wife and baby son, he was rehoused into the then newly built Westbourne Place. He is not allowed to use the large garden overlooked by his flat, and is desperate to move before his son gets older. \u201cHe asks all the time if he can play football in the garden,\u201d Jafari said. \u201cLuckily he is only five so I can try to distract him and say we should play somewhere else. If he was a bit older he would know what was really happening. \u201cIt\u2019s just very disappointing, to be honest, to live like this. I am already suffering with depression from what I went through at Grenfell.\u201d His neighbour Ahmed Ali has been complaining for several months to Westminster council, Redrow, Pinnacle and Octavia about the segregation. \u201cMy seven-year-old has a best friend in his class who lives on that private side,\u201d Ali said. \u201cThey sit in school together but can\u2019t play together. Private residents have access to everything, they can use all the gates and they walk through our side all the time, they exercise their dogs over here. This is open discrimination. We work, we pay service charges, we pay rent, we don\u2019t deserve to be treated like this.\u201d Ali\u2019s younger son is seriously ill with a life-threatening condition and Ali has to make regular trips to the local paediatric intensive care unit. \u201cI\u2019ve told them about my seriously ill son but Pinnacle [which manages the private side of the development] won\u2019t let me park on site or let me come in the main entrance, which is nearer the street disabled bay. Instead I have to carry my sick child in the rain and cold all the way round the building.\u201d One mother, whose children were playing in the small area allocated to social housing residents, said the way private owners can move freely through the social housing side is unjust. \u201cThe private residents are allowed to walk through here, they bring their dogs into our play area and let them off the leash, but we aren\u2019t even allowed to walk through there,\u201d she said. The Guardian asked Octavia if they have made any attempts to negotiate lower service charges or better access for its tenants. A spokesperson replied that although they did not know what the extra cost would be, they did not want to impose a burden on their residents, saying: \u201cThe running costs at this development are quite high, as they are with many new developments of this type. \u201cAccess for our residents to the private sale part of the development and the parking area was not part of the offer from the developer and it was not sought in our lease negotiations, as it would have put an added financial burden on all residents in terms of service charge costs. Keeping costs like this down contributes to making housing more affordable. We are challenging the current access arrangements to parking with the management agents.\u201d Between them the affordable and social homes are paying around \u00a336,000 a year in service charges. Ali and his neighbours say they have offered to pay extra to use the garden but had no response. They have not been given any information on what the garden costs to maintain. In a statement, the deputy mayor of London, James Murray, reiterated Khan\u2019s view that service charges should not be used to segregate residents from communal gardens or play areas. \u201cSegregation has no place in London,\u201d Murray said. \u201cDevelopers considering any form of separation or distinction between social and private housing need to realise their position is morally unacceptable. Any designs that divide communities \u2013 from segregated spaces to poor doors and exorbitant service charges \u2013 have no place in our city.\u201d Councillor Adam Hug, leader of the Labour group in Westminster, said the council had been under the impression at planning stage that all residents would have access across the site. \u201cMy argument is that the onus is on the developers, Redrow, in this situation,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they are setting the service charge too high for Octavia to allow access then I believe that is a breach of the original planning permission that shows open access. Redrow, which posted profits before tax of \u00a3380m in 2018, and which advertised the site as \u201ca distinguished collection of 49 luxury residences\u201d said that the decision to segregate the site by tenure lay with Octavia, who wanted to keep costs down.

CDC, which is wholly owned by the Department for International Development, appointed independent investigators to examine the circumstances surrounding the death of Jo\u00ebl Imbangola Lunea, a 44-year-old father of eight, in Bempumba on 21 July. Land rights activists and villagers claim they are being harassed and intimidated by employees at Feronia, one of Africa\u2019s largest palm oil companies.

The loss-making Canadian-listed palm oil company and its subsidiary, Plantations et Huileries du Congo (PHC), also receives support from other European development banks. The CDC inquiry will examine Feronia\u2019s management of security teams as well as the immediate circumstances of Imbangola\u2019s death. It follows an outcry over the failure of local police to arrest the suspect immediately.

A statement on Feronia\u2019s website, posted in July, said: \u201cThe company is deeply saddened to learn that one of its employees is being sought by the police in relation to the death of Mr Jo\u00ebl Imbangola Lunea on Sunday 21 July 2019. Police are treating Mr [Imbangola]\u2019s death as murder.\u201d The company said it was trying to establish the facts of the case, as there were \u201cdifferent versions of events\u201d being reported. \u201cA number of witnesses have informed the company that the disagreement which led to the tragic incident was of a personal nature but, with the incident occurring approximately 18 km from Feronia\u2019s plantation, near the employee\u2019s home village, whilst he was on four weeks\u2019 annual leave, establishing facts is proving difficult.\u201d Additional reporting by Roger Mwasua Nzambe",

The perennial issue for Deignan has been how many of her teammates will stay in the front long enough to support her when it really counts \u2013 that may change on Saturday given the constant progress of the former national champion Hannah Barnes \u2013 but behind Vos and Van der Breggen the Dutch have immense strength in depth with the top time triallist Annemiek van Vleuten, the 2017 world road champion Chantal Blaak, as well as Amy Pieters, one of the winning mixed relay team on Sunday. Their problem is how to avoid a situation where their riders end up cancelling each other out.</p> <p>There are good sporting and cultural reasons for this dominance.

      "bodyText": "British eyes will be on Lizzie Deignan in Saturday\u2019s women\u2019s road race world championship, with hopes high that Deignan can claim the second world title of her career in her home town, at the finish where she won the women\u2019s Tour de Yorkshire in 2017. Deignan is probably the strongest home medal hope of the week, but the race scenario will not be the Yorkshirewoman versus the rest so much as the Dutch versus everyone else, and if recent history is anything to go by, against each other to boot. Headed by the defending champion Anna van der Breggen and the prolific Marianne Vos, the orange train\u2019s strength is also its potential achilles heel. The perennial issue for Deignan has been how many of her teammates will stay in the front long enough to support her when it really counts \u2013 that may change on Saturday given the constant progress of the former national champion Hannah Barnes \u2013 but behind Vos and Van der Breggen the Dutch have immense strength in depth with the top time triallist Annemiek van Vleuten, the 2017 world road champion Chantal Blaak, as well as Amy Pieters, one of the winning mixed relay team on Sunday. Their problem is how to avoid a situation where their riders end up cancelling each other out. There are good sporting and cultural reasons for this dominance. Having refused to host the second women\u2019s world championships in 1959, the Dutch got firmly behind women\u2019s cycle racing during the 1960s, with a well-supported national team and well-funded race calendar. That in turn fed into the nation\u2019s support for cycling in everyday life to work and school, and produced the multiple champion Katie Hage in the 60s and 70s, and the double world and Olympic champion Leontien van Moorsel in the 90s. The philosophy of \u201ctotal cycling\u201d \u2013 multiple leaders capable of winning \u2013 is a Dutch concept, pioneered by Peter Post at the TI-Raleigh men\u2019s professional team in the 1970s, but it is one that does not always work out for the national women\u2019s team in major championships. One example came in the European road race championship last year in Glasgow, when Van der Breggen broke away in the final phase of the race only for her own teammates to give chase behind. The plan was apparently to work for Vos in the final sprint, only for that to go awry, with Marta Bastianelli of Italy snatching the win.

For me, it\u2019s clear. It\u2019s no difficult from in my normal [trade] team, you always need to work together. You know how it works. We know the game plan before the race. If you don\u2019t work together you won\u2019t win a world championship or any road race.\u201d The Dutchwoman pointed out the situation within the national team is remarkably similar to the way her trade team, Boels-Dolman, works. In one sense, the dominant team at women\u2019s world championships in recent years has been Boels, who have taken the title for the last four years with Deignan, Amalie Dideriksen, Blaak and Van der Breggen.

      "body": "<p>\u201cAnd Manchester United,\u201d said Mark Chapman on Match of the Day 2, \u201care eighth.\u201d To supporters of other clubs, this may be a case of how the mighty are fallen. And yes, it is a crashing come-down from Sir Alex Ferguson\u2019s day, but some of us go back a bit further than that.</p> <p>This is my 50th season. I started off as a fairly typical United fan: born and bred in London, idolising George Best, no previous connection with Manchester. In that first season, 1969-70, the number eight loomed large. The first game I wouldn\u2019t forget was the famous FA Cup tie at Northampton, the 8-2 win in which Best, returning from one of his many bans, scored six. The first league position I remember was the one at the end of that season. \u201cAnd Manchester United are eighth.\u201d Best, Law, Charlton, Stiles and Stepney: eighth.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/24/manchester-united-announce-record-revenue-but-say-focus-is-on-winning-trophies\">Ed Woodward pledges faith in Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r at Manchester United</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Those days were formative \u2013 the first flop is the deepest. And finishing eighth wasn\u2019t a one-off: United did it again the next year, and the one after. If there had been a trophy for coming eighth, they would have been given it to keep. In each of those seasons, Best was the top scorer with more than 20 goals. The board kept appointing different managers \u2013 poor old Wilf McGuinness, Sir Matt Busby (brought back as caretaker), Frank O\u2019Farrell \u2013 to achieve the same result. Does this ring a bell at all?</p> <p>I heard a lot about the European Cup win of 1968, but it was like England\u2019s World Cup in 1966: a lonely triumph, mentioned rather too much. I didn\u2019t expect United to appear in Europe on my watch, and they didn\u2019t, until 1976-77, when their Uefa Cup run fizzled out in the second round.</p> <p>Before that, they\u2019d gone from mediocre to awful and been relegated. It was grim, yet some good came of it. For once in football, the chairman didn\u2019t blame the manager. Tommy Docherty, who had taken them down, was entrusted with dragging them up again, and he did. After winning the Second Division in 1974-75, United made it to third in the First Division and became a good FA Cup team, with Steve Coppell and Gordon Hill whizzing down the wings. By the early 80s, they were top-four regulars.</p> <p>When Ferguson arrived, they went backwards, threatening to make 11th the new eighth. Then the board showed faith again and everything slotted into place. For 22 years, United\u2019s idea of a bad season was finishing third. To be a fan was to feel immense pride and joy, but also a certain weariness: the bereavement of repeated achievement. Sport is supposed to be a rollercoaster. When your team are struggling, you just wish they\u2019d learn to grind out a 1-0. Then they do, and it\u2019s not much fun.</p> <p>After Fergie finally departed, supporting United became far more exasperating and far more interesting. The team went forward to the past. We\u2019ve had more or less the same managers again, in a different order. David Moyes was McGuinness. The roles of Dave Sexton and Ron Atkinson went to Louis van Gaal and Jos\u00e9 Mourinho. Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r started as Docherty and is now turning into O\u2019Farrell. None of them is Ferguson.</p> <p>And now they are eighth \u2013 eighth in a two-horse race. And it\u2019s riveting. I go to more games now than in Fergie\u2019s day. I became a member a few years ago and have the pack to prove it (the scarf is hard to warm to, but the coaster comes in handy). </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a06c74b3962a1a2e9423bc2e108edcc7f8060c48\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a06c74b3962a1a2e9423bc2e108edcc7f8060c48/129_226_5343_3206/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r thanks the fans at Old Trafford but knows things must improve after Wednesday\u2019s penalty shootout victory over League One Rochdale.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r thanks the fans at Old Trafford but knows things must improve after Wednesday\u2019s penalty shootout victory over League One Rochdale.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Livesey/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Solskj\u00e6r is a better shopper than Mourinho \u2013 Harry Maguire, Aaron Wan-Bissaka \u2013 but he seems just as bad at selling. I mourn the proper United players now starring for Ajax (Daley Blind) and Lyon (Memphis Depay). I miss Ander Herrera, who had the heart of a captain, and Romelu Lukaku, whose goals often decided the matches United find trickiest, against middling teams. I even slightly miss Marouane Fellaini, who could always win a point off the bench. Personally, I would have let David de Gea go: Sergio Romero is easily good enough, and he doesn\u2019t cost \u00a3375,000 a week.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/23/solskjaer-manchester-united-west-ham\">Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s rebuild talk cannot mask Manchester United\u2019s sense of drift</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This United can be turgid, tongue-tied, trigger-unhappy. But in every game there are glimmers of hope \u2013 in Marcus Rashford\u2019s marauding and Anthony Martial\u2019s panache, in Paul Pogba\u2019s vision and Wan-Bissaka\u2019s resilience, in Scott McTominay\u2019s fire and Mason Greenwood\u2019s cool.

      "bodyText": "\u201cAnd Manchester United,\u201d said Mark Chapman on Match of the Day 2, \u201care eighth.\u201d To supporters of other clubs, this may be a case of how the mighty are fallen. And yes, it is a crashing come-down from Sir Alex Ferguson\u2019s day, but some of us go back a bit further than that. This is my 50th season. I started off as a fairly typical United fan: born and bred in London, idolising George Best, no previous connection with Manchester. In that first season, 1969-70, the number eight loomed large. The first game I wouldn\u2019t forget was the famous FA Cup tie at Northampton, the 8-2 win in which Best, returning from one of his many bans, scored six. The first league position I remember was the one at the end of that season. \u201cAnd Manchester United are eighth.\u201d Best, Law, Charlton, Stiles and Stepney: eighth. Those days were formative \u2013 the first flop is the deepest. And finishing eighth wasn\u2019t a one-off: United did it again the next year, and the one after. If there had been a trophy for coming eighth, they would have been given it to keep. In each of those seasons, Best was the top scorer with more than 20 goals. The board kept appointing different managers \u2013 poor old Wilf McGuinness, Sir Matt Busby (brought back as caretaker), Frank O\u2019Farrell \u2013 to achieve the same result. Does this ring a bell at all? I heard a lot about the European Cup win of 1968, but it was like England\u2019s World Cup in 1966: a lonely triumph, mentioned rather too much. I didn\u2019t expect United to appear in Europe on my watch, and they didn\u2019t, until 1976-77, when their Uefa Cup run fizzled out in the second round. Before that, they\u2019d gone from mediocre to awful and been relegated. It was grim, yet some good came of it. For once in football, the chairman didn\u2019t blame the manager. Tommy Docherty, who had taken them down, was entrusted with dragging them up again, and he did. After winning the Second Division in 1974-75, United made it to third in the First Division and became a good FA Cup team, with Steve Coppell and Gordon Hill whizzing down the wings. By the early 80s, they were top-four regulars. When Ferguson arrived, they went backwards, threatening to make 11th the new eighth. Then the board showed faith again and everything slotted into place. For 22 years, United\u2019s idea of a bad season was finishing third. To be a fan was to feel immense pride and joy, but also a certain weariness: the bereavement of repeated achievement. Sport is supposed to be a rollercoaster. When your team are struggling, you just wish they\u2019d learn to grind out a 1-0. Then they do, and it\u2019s not much fun. After Fergie finally departed, supporting United became far more exasperating and far more interesting. The team went forward to the past. We\u2019ve had more or less the same managers again, in a different order. David Moyes was McGuinness. The roles of Dave Sexton and Ron Atkinson went to Louis van Gaal and Jos\u00e9 Mourinho. Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r started as Docherty and is now turning into O\u2019Farrell. None of them is Ferguson. And now they are eighth \u2013 eighth in a two-horse race. And it\u2019s riveting. I go to more games now than in Fergie\u2019s day. I became a member a few years ago and have the pack to prove it (the scarf is hard to warm to, but the coaster comes in handy). Solskj\u00e6r is a better shopper than Mourinho \u2013 Harry Maguire, Aaron Wan-Bissaka \u2013 but he seems just as bad at selling. I mourn the proper United players now starring for Ajax (Daley Blind) and Lyon (Memphis Depay). I miss Ander Herrera, who had the heart of a captain, and Romelu Lukaku, whose goals often decided the matches United find trickiest, against middling teams. I even slightly miss Marouane Fellaini, who could always win a point off the bench. Personally, I would have let David de Gea go: Sergio Romero is easily good enough, and he doesn\u2019t cost \u00a3375,000 a week. This United can be turgid, tongue-tied, trigger-unhappy. But in every game there are glimmers of hope \u2013 in Marcus Rashford\u2019s marauding and Anthony Martial\u2019s panache, in Paul Pogba\u2019s vision and Wan-Bissaka\u2019s resilience, in Scott McTominay\u2019s fire and Mason Greenwood\u2019s cool. There is a United team in there, trying to get out. If they could just learn to take free-kicks, corners and throw-ins, they\u2019d be fine. As it is, Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s last 27 league games have yielded 48 points, the very same record that got Mourinho sacked. Solskjaer, who spoke the language of the six-yard box so well as a player, doesn\u2019t seem to know why the goals flew in for his first 17 games and then flew away. \u201cYou are my Solskj\u00e6r,\u201d the crowd still sing, detecting some sunshine in him, and it\u2019s certainly a relief to have seen the back of Mourinho\u2019s sourness. But there\u2019s a run of games in October that could finish this manager \u2013 six away out of seven, and the other one is against Liverpool. If the Glazers had wisdom to match their wealth, they\u2019d be telling Ed Woodward the next head to roll has to be his. When Phil Jones joined in with that chorus of \u201csacked in the morning\u201d at West Ham last week I like to think it was Woodward he had in mind. United\u2019s season may well be grim, but it will still be gripping. They\u2019re like the England cricket team now \u2013 forever landing on the ladder or the snake, skipping the dull squares in between. Even when they\u2019re losing at home to Palace or drawing with Rochdale, even when Solskj\u00e6r prefers Victor Lindel\u00f6f to Axel Tuanzebe or leaves Greenwood on the bench, I\u2019m still riveted. When I mentioned this to a sportswriter friend, he said he felt the same. It\u2019s a mild form of torture, but it\u2019s our torture. We are Masochists United.",

The win was largely forged off the back of two star performances. It wouldn\u2019t be fair to say Joshes Papalii and Hodgson single-handedly drove the Raiders to the grand final, but you wouldn\u2019t be far off. Between Hodgson setting up the first try, saving another, before Papalii again and again rescued Canberra from territorial trouble before scoring the winner in brutal fashion - these two were the heart and soul of a performance that will live long in the memory.</p> <p>Souths were a willing foe, whose resilience and knowhow nearly saw them steal the march on the home side. Cody Walker was threatening, so too were Damien Cook and Adam Doueihi, but ultimately the Raiders\u2019 superior physicality showed, as they ran over the Bunnies, even with Nicol-Klokstad binned with 10 to go.</p> <p>It means the Green Machine travel the the grand final for the first time in 25 years.

Their try came after some sustained pressure - and a scrum play saw Gagai find enough space to crash over.</p> <p>In reality, while the Raiders have probably shaded the Rabbitohs, the visiting team could well be ahead. Late in the piece, Cook sent Tatola over, only for Papalii and Bateman to save the day. Earlier, Hodgson prevented a near-certain four-pointer to Walker via another strip too.</p> <p>Huge amounts of desperation, intensity, and resilience here tonight.

GIO Stadium is home to preliminary final No 1 tonight, and after 80 (possibly 90) minutes of rugby league, we\u2019re going to have a (relatively) unexpected grand final berth for one club.</p> <p>Tonight: where to begin? While the Rabbitohs arguably played the more scintillating football at the season\u2019s commencement, it\u2019s the Raiders who have looked the more imposing unit from winter onwards. There\u2019s a sense of something special in the air for Ricky Stuart\u2019s men, who enter tonight with a fresh, stable squad, at home, against an inconsistent Rabbitohs outfit who many believe are running on empty.</p> <p>But how do you write off a side with Sam Burgess, Damien Cook, Cameron Murray, and a host of other Origin and International players? You don\u2019t. Moreover, they\u2019re coached by Wayne Bennett. The Bunnies haven\u2019t been at their best for a little while, but there\u2019s a wealth of winning DNA in this side \u2013 and they\u2019ll smell an incredible opportunity to snare a grand final berth against a club who\u2019ve lost their last three preliminary finals.</p> <p>Canberra have earned the right to favouritism \u2013 and just about everything points their way. But this is rugby league, and we\u2019ve seen plenty of boil-overs at this point in the season. If there\u2019s one in the offing here, let\u2019s just hope it\u2019s not whistle-led.</p> <p> The Raiders faithful are right to be nervous tonight, though this author thinks the Green Machine will prevail. Your thoughts are exceptionally welcome too \u2013 hit me at @sjjperry on Twitter, or <a href=\"mailto:sam.perry.freelance@guardian.com\">sam.perry.freelance@guardian.com</a> via email.</p> <p>Bit of colour, fanfare, both-barrelled opinion, online warfare to follow before kick-off at 7.50AEST (7.58pm at a guess).</p> <p>Both sides enter the fixture unchanged from latest reports, though Rugby League\u2019s perennial man on the ground, Danny Weidler, is saying he\u2019s received a tip that George Burgess will <strong>not</strong> play. Not sure who that favours more, frankly. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-27T12:11:51.050Z\">at 1.11pm BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Thanks for joining me tonight. I\u2019ll leave you with an email I received from Ally in the UK: \u201cHi Sam, My husband has been trying to make me support the Raiders for ten years \u2013 is now the time to jump on board the green machine? Yours sincerely, Married to a Viking Ally\u201d Ally, in a word, yes. Match report here: Enjoy your rugby League. Take a breath, what a game. Men and women of the Green Machine movement: you made it. This was a pulsating preliminary final, where - in the end - the superior team managed to take the spoils. The win was largely forged off the back of two star performances. It wouldn\u2019t be fair to say Joshes Papalii and Hodgson single-handedly drove the Raiders to the grand final, but you wouldn\u2019t be far off. Between Hodgson setting up the first try, saving another, before Papalii again and again rescued Canberra from territorial trouble before scoring the winner in brutal fashion - these two were the heart and soul of a performance that will live long in the memory. Souths were a willing foe, whose resilience and knowhow nearly saw them steal the march on the home side. Cody Walker was threatening, so too were Damien Cook and Adam Doueihi, but ultimately the Raiders\u2019 superior physicality showed, as they ran over the Bunnies, even with Nicol-Klokstad binned with 10 to go. It means the Green Machine travel the the grand final for the first time in 25 years. They were incredibly supported at home tonight, and one wouldn\u2019t put it past them to bring another level next week. 80 min: Chip over the top from Walker...Raiders fall on it. The Canberra Raiders are through to the Grand Final! GIO/Bruce/Canberra Stadium erupts! Fireworks everywhere, Jarrod Croker sprints away. A great preliminary final returns a great grand finalist. Some on-field reaction (if I can grab any) before some thoughts to follow. The Bunnies keep it alive, swing it left, and score! It\u2019s a little late. Reynolds misses the conversion. Time off...13 seconds to go 76 min: Croker makes a break and goes 40 metres! Crowd rapturous. He can\u2019t go all the way though. The Raiders play out the set, and run down the clock. Later on, the ball is desperately chipped over the top by Souths, it bobbles everywhere, and Cummins somehow adjudicates a Raiders feed. The Green Machine are going to do it. 75 mins: Short kick-off, big contest, and the Rabbitohs get a penalty from it! They get re-started quickly, but soon come unstuck and drop the ball! Croker makes no mistake from in front. 5:19 on the clock, Raiders up by 10. PAPALII! What a barnstorming run! He gets the ball back on the inside from Sezer centre-field and beats one, two, three, four, and crashes over under the posts! He\u2019s swamped by his team-mates, and so he should be. That was memorable. The Raiders are up by 8, kick to come. 71 min: Canberra hold on after a terrible last option play - it\u2019s all helter skelter here. Later on Croker has the ball dislodged but there\u2019s no six-again? Last tackle , much slower from Canberra now, Sezer sends it up but Corey Allan takes it. The Bunnies then cough it up at the play the ball! It\u2019s Doueihi, who\u2019s otherwise been great. Papalii punches the air. The Raiders have the ball 20 metres out, six tackles in hand. Can they ice this? 69 min: Last play Bunnies, and it\u2019s intercepted by Reynolds! He races 60 metres before Nicol-Klokstad runs him down. CNK then strips the ball and he\u2019s penalised and sent to the bin for 10 mins! Huge! Correct call, to be fair. Souths have a huge shot here. 67 min: The Raiders hang on! They\u2019ve got the ball again. Is there anything in the tank? Who will get them out of trouble? Papalii manages an off-load and there\u2019s now six to go! 65 min: And another repeat set for Souths! As Fatty says, \u201cThey don\u2019t look like getting through,\u201d but they keep getting the ball. How long can the Raiders hold on? Meanwhile Leilua goes from the field with an ankle injury - he\u2019s unlikely to return. Wighton attemps a short dropout - it\u2019s horrible - it travels 20 metres and no one\u2019s there to contest it! 64 min: Could be a huge play here. The Raiders looked to have weathered another Souths raid, but as Cotric fell onto a ball in the field of play, laying prone, Walker dragged him back into the in-goal, and there\u2019s now a goal-line dropout. 62 min: Solid set from the Raiders. Great kick from Hodgson that finds space. Papalii about to come back on. At the Souths end, Adam Doueihi has passed his HIA and will return. 60 min: Soliolo strips it from Cook! What a play! Defuses a huge amount of pressure! Now the Raiders get to breathe. 59 min: Wighton\u2019s drop out goes out on the full! Penalty in front of the sticks. Souths take the tap... 58 min: And another set for Souths, who keep the pressure on. This time, Reynolds grubbers it in with his left foot, Croker snares it but he can\u2019t beat the on-rushing defence. Pressure builds. 56 min: A disjointed set of six for Souths, but ultimately Sutton dribbles it in-goal, Rapana gathers, and it\u2019ll be another set of six for Souths. 54 min: Sloppy play the ball from BJ Leilua 40m from his own line, and Souths get the ball. You fancy them here, too, after all their resilience so far. 52 mins: A stray ball is picked up by Croker and he\u2019s taken high by Burgess, meaning immediate penalty. Is Burgess injured after that? He\u2019s holding his pec (or shoulder) and is coming off. From the penalty, the Raiders go close with a crash ball on the left from Sezer to Whitehead but he spills it. The Bunnies repel them again. 50 min: Further fallout from the Papalii shot is that Doueihi is off for an HIA, Johnston going to fullback. They\u2019ve got great field position following the penalty, but Croker smothers Lowe on the last with a wonderful tackle. Raiders ball. And again, Papalii with another huge run! 49 min: More excellent defence from Souths, they repel the Raiders again. If they win tonight, it will be on the back of this stuff. Doueihi comes away with it and wow, he\u2019s hit hard by Papalii. Shoulder charge? Souths players think so. Papalii is called out by Cummins, and he\u2019s on report. Commentators unanimous he\u2019s not got much to worry about, I\u2019m not so sure. 48 min: Now Reynolds kicks out on the full! Rabbitohs under the pump. The Raiders need to capitalise. Can Souths hang on? 47 min: Raiders have all the momentum and they generate another opportunity here. A stray bomb gets a tough bounce, the Raiders come up with it, they shift the ball right but then Walker executes a try saver on Sezer. A season saver? Great bit of improvisation from Wighton, and he puts his team ahead. Can Croker convert from the sideline? He can\u2019t, it hits the post! 44 min: Possible try Canberra! Ball goes up in the air, CNK knocks it back after a contest with Doueihi, it falls to Wighton, who then loses it, but kicks it before the ball hits the ground. There are now fifteen replays of exactly this - presumably as the referees open the rule book on this. Sterlo thinks \u201che\u2019s improvised\u201d. No doubt Wighton loses control, but does the kicking of the ball pre-ground negate the knock on? It does! TRY! 43 min: We\u2019re set for set. No errors. Good kicks. Who blinks first? Walker then takes it to the line and puts Gagai through a half-gap. He\u2019s warming into this match nicely. Eventually Sezer returns with the ball, before a hold up as Campbell Graham has a badly split nose that needs tending to. 41 min: Shaky first set from the Raiders before Papalii surges 19 metres, allowing Hodgson to get a kick away, and render the set passable. The Rabbitohs\u2019 turn now... Back out for the second half Promises to be a nail-biter, this. The Freddie Mercury vocal range is getting a workover, and the crowd is up to the task. The Raiders started very physically, and appeared to be grinding the Bunnies into submission. They\u2019ve been inspirationally led by captain Josh Hodgson, who set up the Green Machine\u2019s only try, and has been a menace in both defence and attack. Despite a sluggish start, the Bunnies came into their own after the Raiders\u2019 try, first establishing a firmer foundation in the middle, before Cook and Walker started enjoying some space down their left edge. Their try came after some sustained pressure - and a scrum play saw Gagai find enough space to crash over. In reality, while the Raiders have probably shaded the Rabbitohs, the visiting team could well be ahead. Late in the piece, Cook sent Tatola over, only for Papalii and Bateman to save the day. Earlier, Hodgson prevented a near-certain four-pointer to Walker via another strip too. Huge amounts of desperation, intensity, and resilience here tonight. The Raiders look willing, but the Bunnies are staying with them. Another 40 to go... Breathtaking stuff ... will regain it, and summarise accordingly. 35 min: Wighton stabs the ball deep but Doueihi picks it up off his bootlaces, beats a man, and sprints 30 metres before Nicoll-Klokstad brings him down. The ball heads down the other end before Wighton pounces on a loose kick and sprints 50 metres before Gagai roped him in. An error follows, and everyone gets a breath. Honours evening up here as we head toward half-time. 33 min: Try Souths? After bouncing side-to-side for the entire set of six, Damien Cook finds a quick play-the-ball and sends Tatola (seemingly) over. But Cummins wants a look, soft-signals No Try, and so it proves. Papalii and Bateman with the tackles. Desperate stuff. 31 min: Both sides trade strong sets of six with good kicks, and it appears the Bunnies have a second wind. Bateman then attempts a strip, but is ruled to have knocked on. Risky business. Souths have the ball on halfway, five tackles in hand. Beautifully struck from Reynolds. On the wrong side for a right-footer, near the sideline, he pierces the sticks. Another scrum play, and this looked all too easy. A sweeping movement left-to-right, many decoys, before Reynolds found Gagai who split Croker and Cotric, and slid over. Raiders defence appeared to hold off, no doubt due to the multitudes of aforementioned decoys. It will be Reynolds trying to convert from the sideline. 26 min: Just as Souths look to have weathered the storm, Bateman spills a kick driven into him. A tough take, to be fair. Souths get another set. 25 min: Hodgson with a try-saving strip! Bunnies enact the scrum-play, they go left, and create the overlap. Cody Walker looks like he\u2019s going to bump past Hodgson to score, and Hodgson strips it off him! Walker loses it over the line, the ball goes dead, and Canberra survive! Goal-line drop-out Raiders. 24 min: Mistake Canberra! New entrant Lui spills his first touch! Great field position for Souths. 21 min: More pressure on Souths. Canberra work the ball back into an attacking position, then hoist one to the corner. Souths eventually regain possession, and conjure a settling set of six that restores some territory for them. They\u2019re hanging on here - they\u2019re getting significantly outmuscled. 19 min: Penalty Canberra The Raiders have added venom after their try, and have Souths back-pedalling in defence. Eventually it takes a toll, as Souths hold the Raiders player down too long. 30m out, 10m in from touch, and Croker will have a shot. He misses! 20m out, 15m in from touch, Croker makes so mistake. And the Raiders are on the board through that man Hodgson, who minutes earlier appeared to have succumbed to an HIA. He may well still do. Until then, he\u2019s the most influential player on the field. Possible Try! Incredible stuff. That man Hodgson. He grubbers the ball into the in-goal. Corey Allan grabs it for Souths, and is trying to get into the field of play. But then Hodgson tackles the ball loose, before Croker gets it down. They go to the bunker... 13 min: They\u2019re saying Hodgson\u2019s okay - though that seems tough to believe. This set of six also comes to zero, before Wighton stabs dead. Disappointing. But then, Hodgson gets a one-on-one steal! 11 min: Looks like Hodgson might be in HIA trouble...more on that shortly. After some confusion, Leilua takes the ball - is tackled - the ref says play on - he plays the ball - the ref then says \u2018last\u2019, so Leilua grubbers through, before Tapine crashes into the receiving Doueihi and he loses the ball! More field position for the Raiders. We\u2019ll keep an eye on Hodgson... 9 min: No dice! A bit of an arhythmic set for the Raiders - passes behind players, and the Rabbitohs held firm. The Bunnies come away with it. 7 min: Papalii gets a quick play the ball which allows a strong Hodgson kick on the last, and Croker et al drive Souths into their corner. A few tackles later and bang! Burgess is hammered and drops it! Huge play. Solioli involved. Raiders will get a good look here... \u201cThe arm carrying the ball contacts the ground...\u201d says the bunker man. It\u2019s a changeover to the Raiders. Sterlo meanwhile is explaining that the Rabbitohs have bombed this - squandering an easy 2-on-1 after Leilua had attempted an intercept. The Raiders come away with it. 5 min: HUGE dropout from Wighton, goes 60 metres! Later on the Bunnies cross the line in the corner, but it looks like it\u2019s been passed from the ground. Ben Cummins is going to have a look at it though. \u201cYou can\u2019t do that,\u201d says Sterlo. 4 min: Bunnies go side-to-side, but the Raiders hold firm. Reynolds puts one up across the posts on the last, and after a bit of a messy bounce, the Raiders take it dead. Another set of six for them to defend... 2 min: Penalty - Leilua takes Doueihi high deep in Souths territory, and a reliving penalty to Souths. They then execute a solid set of six before Reynolds chips a beautiful ball into the Raiders\u2019 in-goal, and Cotric is pinned. \u201cShows what ill-discipline can do,\u201d says Sterlo, referring to Leilua\u2019s high tackle. Canberra kick-off, and we\u2019re away. Burgess takes the first hit-up, and later in the set a ball\u2019s left behind the line. A strong defensive set from the Raiders before Reynolds hoists a huge torpedo downfield to restore the metreage. Raiders will get the ball in favourable field position though. Dean Lance - hero from the \u201889 GF - marshals the Viking clap! The Raiders are out there. It\u2019s completely packed - the ground sold out in six minutes. It looks a picture. Probably doesn\u2019t feel it - apparently the temperature\u2019s heading down to single digits. Players are on their way It\u2019s the Bunnies first. You can never really hear the boo\u2019s, but I\u2019ve no doubt they exist. Just on the myrtle and green - Ethan Lowe comes into the starting line-up, Tom Burgess drops to the bench. Tom\u2019s brother, George, misses the squad - as D Weidler foretold. Souths line-up 1-17 1. Adam Doueihi 2. Alex Johnston 4. Dane Gagai 5. Campbell Graham 19. Corey Allan 6. Cody Walker 7.

Dunamis Lui The Raiders took to the field earlier for a warm-up. Hell of a response from the home crowd. Bone Cone speaks for most of the Internet, I\u2019d venture Light trolling from the Bunnies on Twitter In a week where we\u2019ve seen the humble meme show the ability to engender mass support for sporting outfits, here is Souths\u2019 sacrilegious take on the solemn Viking Clap. News from the Folau orbit The international governing body has voted to suspend the Tongan National Rugby League\u2019s membership, though Australian Rugby League Commission chairman Peter Beattie denies it\u2019s got anything to do with Israel Folau\u2019s mooted comeback. An AAP piece here details more: Wayne Bennett\u2019s in typically charming form tonight More pics from a brisk, yet clear Canberra evening. The calm before the Viking storm There\u2019s no doubt English Rugby League is on the rise, as evidenced by the huge number of their players taking part in tonight\u2019s fixtures. Excellent piece here from John Davidson well worth your time, as we count down to kick off: Souths have won the toss and will kick off This realistically means very little. Captain Hodgson says \u201cthe boys are very relaxed,\u201d and we learn little more. Incidentally, after some umm-ing and ahh-ing, Burgess opted to run \u201cleft-to-right\u201d. The greatest of evenings to all rugby league folk and otherwise. Can you feel the anticipation in the Canberra air? GIO Stadium is home to preliminary final No 1 tonight, and after 80 (possibly 90) minutes of rugby league, we\u2019re going to have a (relatively) unexpected grand final berth for one club. Tonight: where to begin? While the Rabbitohs arguably played the more scintillating football at the season\u2019s commencement, it\u2019s the Raiders who have looked the more imposing unit from winter onwards. There\u2019s a sense of something special in the air for Ricky Stuart\u2019s men, who enter tonight with a fresh, stable squad, at home, against an inconsistent Rabbitohs outfit who many believe are running on empty. But how do you write off a side with Sam Burgess, Damien Cook, Cameron Murray, and a host of other Origin and International players? You don\u2019t. Moreover, they\u2019re coached by Wayne Bennett. The Bunnies haven\u2019t been at their best for a little while, but there\u2019s a wealth of winning DNA in this side \u2013 and they\u2019ll smell an incredible opportunity to snare a grand final berth against a club who\u2019ve lost their last three preliminary finals. Canberra have earned the right to favouritism \u2013 and just about everything points their way. But this is rugby league, and we\u2019ve seen plenty of boil-overs at this point in the season. If there\u2019s one in the offing here, let\u2019s just hope it\u2019s not whistle-led. The Raiders faithful are right to be nervous tonight, though this author thinks the Green Machine will prevail. Your thoughts are exceptionally welcome too \u2013 hit me at @sjjperry on Twitter, or sam.perry.freelance@guardian.com via email. Bit of colour, fanfare, both-barrelled opinion, online warfare to follow before kick-off at 7.50AEST (7.58pm at a guess). Both sides enter the fixture unchanged from latest reports, though Rugby League\u2019s perennial man on the ground, Danny Weidler, is saying he\u2019s received a tip that George Burgess will not play. Not sure who that favours more, frankly.",

And not only compromise, but understanding \u2013 from both sets of negotiators. Little of that has been forthcoming.</p> <p>There is much <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/12/voter-registration-focus-inequality-turnout-general-election\" title=\"\">talk of a general election</a>. In the present atmosphere it would be likely to become the most unsavoury election of modern times. Until Brexit is resolved, a general election would solve nothing. It would merely fuel the current feeling of disillusionment and disunity. It may also be pointless, as the most likely outcome is another fragmented parliament \u2013 even more bitterly divided than it is now.</p> <p>So why is the government so keen to put our country through that? There may be a political calculation: they believe the Labour party is unelectable under the present leadership; ministers know how serious the problems will be for the people of this country after a no-deal Brexit, and wish to have the election out of the way before the reality of the mess that lies ahead becomes clear.</p> <p>Let me put it another way: if the government was truly confident in the aftermath of their Brexit policy, they would wait for next spring, when they could take credit for the success of Brexit; rejoice \u2013 even gloat \u2013 that all fears about it were unfounded; and propose a few popular one nation policies to restore the fortunes of the Conservatives.</p> <p>But instead, to reinforce their electoral appeal, the government seems intent on whipping up dissent by using <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/sep/26/boris-johnsons-brexit-rhetoric-condemned-as-mps-tell-of-death-threats-politics-live?page=with:block-5d8ca34a8f081108db9bd26c\" title=\"\">highly emotional and evocative language</a> that can only provoke fear and anger, and fuel grievances against parliament and the law \u2013 inciting opposition to the most important bulwarks of our state and its freedom.</p> <p>Their approach is profoundly un-Conservative and \u2013 whatever its short-term effect \u2013 will do permanent damage to the reputation of the party. I cannot believe any previous government in our long history would have even considered such reckless and divisive behaviour.</p> <p>We were promised, during the referendum campaign, that Brexit would \u201c\u2026 restore parliamentary sovereignty and the supremacy of UK law\u201d. For that reason, I am assuming there will be no further political trickery from this government.</p> <p>There is a contradiction between the act prohibiting the UK <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/sep/06/brexit-boris-johnson-news-latest-eu-labour-confirms-it-will-not-vote-on-monday-night-for-early-election-live-newsbior\" title=\"\">leaving the EU without a deal</a>, and the prime minister\u2019s continued assertion that he will leave on 31 October.</p> <p>My fear is that the government will seek to bypass statute law by passing an order of council to suspend the act until after 31 October. It is important to note that an order of council can be passed by privy councillors \u2013 that is government ministers \u2013 without involving the Queen.</p> <p>I should warn the prime minister that \u2013 if this route is taken \u2013 it will be in flagrant defiance of parliament and utterly disrespectful to the supreme court. It would be a piece of political chicanery that no one should ever forgive or forget.</p> <p>I am a lifelong Conservative. I hope our millions of traditional, moderate, middle-of-the-road supporters understand that this Conservative government\u2019s present position is an aberration.</p> <p>Most Conservatives are not a Brexit party tribute band, nor have we abandoned our core values to find compromise, seek allies, and strive for unity, rather than division and disarray. We abhor the language of division and hate \u2013 and words such as \u201csaboteur\u201d, \u201ctraitor\u201d, \u201cenemy\u201d, \u201csurrender\u201d, \u201cbetrayal\u201d have no place in our party, our politics, nor in our society. It is emphatically not who we are as a people. And must never be seen as so.</p> <p>I hope the Conservative parliamentary party will regain its sense of balance, and rein in the faction of a faction that now prevails in cabinet.</p> <p>Now that parliament is sitting again, it has the opportunity to prove its quality, its strength, its purpose and its power. I hope that every member of parliament \u2013 from all parties \u2013 will unite together, and rise to that challenge.</p> <p>\u2022 John Major is a former prime minister.

And not only compromise, but understanding \u2013 from both sets of negotiators. Little of that has been forthcoming. There is much talk of a general election. In the present atmosphere it would be likely to become the most unsavoury election of modern times. Until Brexit is resolved, a general election would solve nothing. It would merely fuel the current feeling of disillusionment and disunity. It may also be pointless, as the most likely outcome is another fragmented parliament \u2013 even more bitterly divided than it is now. So why is the government so keen to put our country through that? There may be a political calculation: they believe the Labour party is unelectable under the present leadership; ministers know how serious the problems will be for the people of this country after a no-deal Brexit, and wish to have the election out of the way before the reality of the mess that lies ahead becomes clear. Let me put it another way: if the government was truly confident in the aftermath of their Brexit policy, they would wait for next spring, when they could take credit for the success of Brexit; rejoice \u2013 even gloat \u2013 that all fears about it were unfounded; and propose a few popular one nation policies to restore the fortunes of the Conservatives. But instead, to reinforce their electoral appeal, the government seems intent on whipping up dissent by using highly emotional and evocative language that can only provoke fear and anger, and fuel grievances against parliament and the law \u2013 inciting opposition to the most important bulwarks of our state and its freedom. Their approach is profoundly un-Conservative and \u2013 whatever its short-term effect \u2013 will do permanent damage to the reputation of the party. I cannot believe any previous government in our long history would have even considered such reckless and divisive behaviour. We were promised, during the referendum campaign, that Brexit would \u201c\u2026 restore parliamentary sovereignty and the supremacy of UK law\u201d. For that reason, I am assuming there will be no further political trickery from this government. There is a contradiction between the act prohibiting the UK leaving the EU without a deal, and the prime minister\u2019s continued assertion that he will leave on 31 October. My fear is that the government will seek to bypass statute law by passing an order of council to suspend the act until after 31 October. It is important to note that an order of council can be passed by privy councillors \u2013 that is government ministers \u2013 without involving the Queen. I should warn the prime minister that \u2013 if this route is taken \u2013 it will be in flagrant defiance of parliament and utterly disrespectful to the supreme court. It would be a piece of political chicanery that no one should ever forgive or forget. I am a lifelong Conservative. I hope our millions of traditional, moderate, middle-of-the-road supporters understand that this Conservative government\u2019s present position is an aberration. Most Conservatives are not a Brexit party tribute band, nor have we abandoned our core values to find compromise, seek allies, and strive for unity, rather than division and disarray. We abhor the language of division and hate \u2013 and words such as \u201csaboteur\u201d, \u201ctraitor\u201d, \u201cenemy\u201d, \u201csurrender\u201d, \u201cbetrayal\u201d have no place in our party, our politics, nor in our society. It is emphatically not who we are as a people. And must never be seen as so. I hope the Conservative parliamentary party will regain its sense of balance, and rein in the faction of a faction that now prevails in cabinet. Now that parliament is sitting again, it has the opportunity to prove its quality, its strength, its purpose and its power. I hope that every member of parliament \u2013 from all parties \u2013 will unite together, and rise to that challenge. \u2022 John Major is a former prime minister.

But it\u2019s also important to protect the right of MPs to speak freely in the House of Commons about important political matters and the fact of the so-called Benn Act is that it surrenders our powers.\u201d</p> \n<p>Tensions remained high in parliament after Wednesday night\u2019s toxic and heated scenes in the House of Commons. A Labour MP, Karl Turner, confronted Johnson\u2019s senior adviser, Dominic Cummings, over death threats received by MPs overnight following the parliamentary debate. Cummings responded: \u201cGet Brexit done.\u201d</p> \n<p>At an event later, Cummings later doubled down on his suggestion that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/26/dominic-cummings-delivering-brexit-only-way-to-solve-abuse-of-mps\">only carrying out Brexit would calm tensions</a>.</p> \n<p>\u201cI know people on both sides of leave and remain who have had serious threats like that, and it is obviously bad. In the end the situation can only be resolved by parliament honouring its promise to respect the result.\u201d</p> \n<p>Johnson\u2019s hardline language and tactics appeared to show he is increasingly focused on fighting an election, amid pessimism in the government and Brussels about the chances of reaching a new EU withdrawal agreement at the October summit. He told his cabinet that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/26/boris-johnson-refuses-to-apologise-for-language-about-jo-cox\">the phrase \u201csurrender bill\u201d was hitting home with voters</a> and would form a key part of any campaign.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"726eebbd-fc5e-41a5-8752-a12d293b2472\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yD-4vs7He6M?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>With <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/26/opposition-planning-again-seize-control-commons-next-week-brexit-corbyn\">Labour</a> refusing an election until no deal is off the table, Johnson is still insisting that he will not have to seek an extension from the EU if he fails to reach a deal.</p> \n<p>Many opposition MPs are sceptical that there really is a way to circumvent the Benn law, but Sir John Major, the former prime minister, will warn on Friday that the government could seek a \u201corder of council\u201d to delay that legislation coming into effect.</p> \n<p>\u201cMy fear is that the government will seek to bypass statute law, by passing an order of council to suspend the Act until after 31 October,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is important to note that an order of council can be passed by privy councillors \u2013 that is government ministers \u2013 without involving the Queen.</p> \n<p>\u201cI should warn the prime minister that \u2013 if this route is taken \u2013 it will be in flagrant defiance of parliament and utterly disrespectful to the supreme court. It would be a piece of political chicanery that no-one should ever forgive or forget.\u201d</p> \n<p>No 10 declined to comment on the idea but there were signs that Johnson\u2019s administration has not resiled from its combative approach to the law, which led to the supreme court ruling unanimously that the suspension of parliament was unlawful.</p> \n<p>A cabinet source said Johnson is preparing to prorogue parliament again a few days before a Queen\u2019s speech to set out his domestic agenda, with the current intention to stick to the original date of 14 October. The prime minister also intends to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/26/mps-reject-mini-recess-for-conservative-conference\">carry on with Conservative party conference next week</a> as usual, while opposition MPs sit in parliament attempting to undermine his strategy.</p> \n<p>Throughout the day on Thursday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/26/boris-johnson-refuses-to-apologise-for-language-about-jo-cox\">Johnson took a defiant approach to the criticism</a> of MPs who lambasted him for his language in the House of Commons, refusing to appear for a question in parliament on his rhetoric. Instead, he addressed Tory backbench MPs, telling them that he would carry on referring to the \u201csurrender bill\u201d.</p> \n<p>Tory MPs said the mood of Johnson\u2019s meeting had been \u201clargely supportive\u201d but others sighed or raised their eyebrows when asked how he had performed.</p> \n<p>Nicky Morgan, the culture secretary, sent a pointed tweet saying that a \u201ctime of strong feelings we all need to remind ourselves of the effect of everything we say on those watching us\u201d, although she cushioned it with a claim that the prime minister was sympathetic about threats received by MPs.</p> \n<p>However, Johnson was criticised more directly by his own sister, Rachel, who told Sky News: \u201cI think it was a very tasteless way of referring to the memory of a murdered MP, murdered by someone who said \u2018Britain first\u2019, of the far-right tendency, which you could argue is being whipped up by this sort of language.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"c0393590-2aed-40fe-abb4-be9ab0b03446\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jutYLDL08TQ?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cMy brother is using words like surrender and capitulation as if the people standing in the way of the blessed will of the people as defined by 17.4m votes in 2016 should be hung, drawn, quartered, tarred and feathered. I think that is highly reprehensible language to use.\u201d</p> \n<p>Johnson was also taken to task directly by Jess Phillips, the Labour MP, in the voting lobbies over his hostile rhetoric, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/26/man-arrested-outside-office-of-labour-mp-jess-phillips\">on the same day a man was arrested outside her office</a>.</p> \n<p>The prime minister later acknowledged that there was a \u201creasonable anxiety\u201d that MPs in other parties may be less willing to vote for any Brexit deal because of the divisive nature of Wednesday\u2019s debate. However, some Labour backbenchers are still willing to consider what is on offer if there is a chance of resolving Brexit.</p> \n<p>Stephen Kinnock, who is a member of the MPs for a Deal group, said: \u201cJohnson\u2019s language, tone and behaviour are not helpful but we must not allow ourselves to be distracted from the number one priority which is to secure a deal that protects \u2026 our constituents so that we can then begin to reunite our deeply divided country.\u201d</p> \n<p>When asked at Thursday night\u2019s event in London whether Johnson was under pressure to deliver Brexit, Cummings said: \u201cWe are not under pressure, the referendum was pressure. The referendum was difficult. This is a walk in the park compared to the referendum. We are enjoying this, we are going to leave and we are going to win.\u201d</p>",

He also declined to retract his comments about the murder of Jo Cox, after saying the best way to honour her memory was to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d. \u201cObviously I\u2019m deeply sorry for the threats that MPs face and I think it\u2019s very important we look after them, particularly look after female MPs,\u201d he told the BBC. \u201cThe death of Jo Cox was an absolute tragedy which I think bought the House of Commons together in unison. But it\u2019s also important to protect the right of MPs to speak freely in the House of Commons about important political matters and the fact of the so-called Benn Act is that it surrenders our powers.\u201d Tensions remained high in parliament after Wednesday night\u2019s toxic and heated scenes in the House of Commons. A Labour MP, Karl Turner, confronted Johnson\u2019s senior adviser, Dominic Cummings, over death threats received by MPs overnight following the parliamentary debate. Cummings responded: \u201cGet Brexit done.\u201d At an event later, Cummings later doubled down on his suggestion that only carrying out Brexit would calm tensions. \u201cI know people on both sides of leave and remain who have had serious threats like that, and it is obviously bad. In the end the situation can only be resolved by parliament honouring its promise to respect the result.\u201d Johnson\u2019s hardline language and tactics appeared to show he is increasingly focused on fighting an election, amid pessimism in the government and Brussels about the chances of reaching a new EU withdrawal agreement at the October summit. He told his cabinet that the phrase \u201csurrender bill\u201d was hitting home with voters and would form a key part of any campaign. With Labour refusing an election until no deal is off the table, Johnson is still insisting that he will not have to seek an extension from the EU if he fails to reach a deal. Many opposition MPs are sceptical that there really is a way to circumvent the Benn law, but Sir John Major, the former prime minister, will warn on Friday that the government could seek a \u201corder of council\u201d to delay that legislation coming into effect. \u201cMy fear is that the government will seek to bypass statute law, by passing an order of council to suspend the Act until after 31 October,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is important to note that an order of council can be passed by privy councillors \u2013 that is government ministers \u2013 without involving the Queen. \u201cI should warn the prime minister that \u2013 if this route is taken \u2013 it will be in flagrant defiance of parliament and utterly disrespectful to the supreme court. It would be a piece of political chicanery that no-one should ever forgive or forget.\u201d No 10 declined to comment on the idea but there were signs that Johnson\u2019s administration has not resiled from its combative approach to the law, which led to the supreme court ruling unanimously that the suspension of parliament was unlawful. A cabinet source said Johnson is preparing to prorogue parliament again a few days before a Queen\u2019s speech to set out his domestic agenda, with the current intention to stick to the original date of 14 October. The prime minister also intends to carry on with Conservative party conference next week as usual, while opposition MPs sit in parliament attempting to undermine his strategy. Throughout the day on Thursday, Johnson took a defiant approach to the criticism of MPs who lambasted him for his language in the House of Commons, refusing to appear for a question in parliament on his rhetoric. Instead, he addressed Tory backbench MPs, telling them that he would carry on referring to the \u201csurrender bill\u201d. Tory MPs said the mood of Johnson\u2019s meeting had been \u201clargely supportive\u201d but others sighed or raised their eyebrows when asked how he had performed. Nicky Morgan, the culture secretary, sent a pointed tweet saying that a \u201ctime of strong feelings we all need to remind ourselves of the effect of everything we say on those watching us\u201d, although she cushioned it with a claim that the prime minister was sympathetic about threats received by MPs. However, Johnson was criticised more directly by his own sister, Rachel, who told Sky News: \u201cI think it was a very tasteless way of referring to the memory of a murdered MP, murdered by someone who said \u2018Britain first\u2019, of the far-right tendency, which you could argue is being whipped up by this sort of language. \u201cMy brother is using words like surrender and capitulation as if the people standing in the way of the blessed will of the people as defined by 17.4m votes in 2016 should be hung, drawn, quartered, tarred and feathered. I think that is highly reprehensible language to use.\u201d Johnson was also taken to task directly by Jess Phillips, the Labour MP, in the voting lobbies over his hostile rhetoric, on the same day a man was arrested outside her office. The prime minister later acknowledged that there was a \u201creasonable anxiety\u201d that MPs in other parties may be less willing to vote for any Brexit deal because of the divisive nature of Wednesday\u2019s debate. However, some Labour backbenchers are still willing to consider what is on offer if there is a chance of resolving Brexit. Stephen Kinnock, who is a member of the MPs for a Deal group, said: \u201cJohnson\u2019s language, tone and behaviour are not helpful but we must not allow ourselves to be distracted from the number one priority which is to secure a deal that protects \u2026 our constituents so that we can then begin to reunite our deeply divided country.\u201d When asked at Thursday night\u2019s event in London whether Johnson was under pressure to deliver Brexit, Cummings said: \u201cWe are not under pressure, the referendum was pressure. The referendum was difficult. This is a walk in the park compared to the referendum. We are enjoying this, we are going to leave and we are going to win.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s early afternoon in Lintulaakson school in Espoo, near Helsinki. The younger children are having a snack before starting their after-school activities. Upstairs a group of 12-year-olds are in a craft class, cutting patterns and making clothes on sewing machines. Outside, children play in an enormous outdoor space, equipped with a climbing frames, football pitches and basketball courts. \u201cHey, Petteri,\u201d one boy yells casually at the principal, Petteri Kuusim\u00e4ki. \u201cNext year can we start school a bit later, at 10am?\u201d Kuusim\u00e4ki jokes with them. It\u2019s all first names here. The Finnish education system is the envy of the world. Along with Tove Jansson\u2019s Moomins, Nokia phones and Iittala glassware, it has become one of the country\u2019s most celebrated exports \u2013 and it\u2019s easy to see why. Its students consistently score well at the top end of the Pisa international league tables, and as Kuusim\u00e4ki walks me round his school he describes a kind of education utopia \u2013 a place where teachers are highly trained, revered and trusted, and children\u2019s wellbeing is paramount. There are no Ofsted-style inspections, no streaming by ability, no national exams until 18, no school uniforms, no school league tables and no fee-paying private schools. At its party conference this week, Labour committed to follow Finland\u2019s lead and not only scrap Ofsted but abolish private schools by forcing their integration with the state sector. Explaining the policy, the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, told BBC Radio 4: \u201cIn some countries, it is not allowed to charge for education in any form \u2026 in Finland, for example.\u201d The British Labour party is far from alone in its enthusiasm for the Finnish education system. Every year hundreds of delegations of teachers and policymakers from all over the world pour into Helsinki to see this nirvana for themselves. So popular has it become that international visits are strictly regulated and have to be paid for \u2013 a presentation costs \u20ac682 (\u00a3607) per hour and a school visit \u20ac1,240. In the past two months there have been groups from Israel, Brazil, China and Korea. In the coming weeks there will be visits from New Zealand and Lithuania. Meanwhile, Finland\u2019s influence is spreading far and wide. Last month a school opened in Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam based on the Finnish curriculum and pedagogical approach, with Finnish staff on the teaching team. Kuusim\u00e4ki tells me Finland\u2019s schools are well-funded and built around the principle of equality of opportunity for all pupils. He is baffled when I try to explain that some state schools in England are so strapped for cash that they are asking parents for donations. \u201cAs you may know, everything is free in Finland,\u201d he says, university included. There is just one fee-paying school in the country, the International School of Helsinki, which has mainly catered for international employees of Nokia and other industries. Otherwise, charging fees is illegal and parents are happy by and large to send their children to their local school. \u201cWe really don\u2019t have bad schools,\u201d Kuusim\u00e4ki says. In class children are listened to and respected, school lunches are free, detentions are rare and exclusions pretty much unheard of. Kuusim\u00e4ki gave his last detention 15 years ago, and is visibly horrified at the idea of excluding a child from school. \u201cAs a principal, you can\u2019t think like that. We are responsible for these children and their lives. We can\u2019t give up.\u201d But things are changing slowly. Schools are becoming more diverse \u2013 20% of pupils at Lintulaakson school are from immigrant backgrounds, elsewhere it is 75%. The curriculum has been revised and Kuusim\u00e4ki says more has had to be done to stretch gifted children. A compulsory pre-school year for six-year-olds has been introduced to help with school-readiness, and there is talk of starting even earlier, while the minimum school leaving age has recently been raised to 18. Meanwhile, parents \u201cshopping for schools\u201d is on the increase. Finnish education experts would be the first to admit they do not have all the answers and methods in one country do not always translate to another. John Jerrim, professor of education and social statistics at the University College London Institute of Education, does not believe England should be looking to Finland. \u201cIts Pisa scores have actually been in decline. And there is no reason to believe their high scores on international tests are due to their schools. So there is no reason to try to copy Finland.\u201d Not even on outlawing school fees? \u201cThe resource will just be shifted elsewhere,\u201d Jerrim says. \u201cThere are lots of potential unintended consequences, for example, pushing up house prices near good schools.\u201d In 2013 the celebrated Finnish educator Pasi Sahlberg paid a visit to Eton College, the most famous of the UK\u2019s ancient, elite boarding schools. Once a maths and science teacher in Helsinki, Sahlberg now tours the world spreading the word about the wonders of Finnish education and advising on education reform. \u201cIt was like going 200 years backwards in time,\u201d Sahlberg recalls of his visit. \u201cI remember thinking while walking the corridors of Eton and watching students there that even if I had a chance to enrol my own kids to that school I would probably say \u2018no, thank you\u2019.\u201d With its illustrious history, bizarre uniforms and \u00a340,000 a year fees, Eton \u2013 which educated the current British prime minister and many before him \u2013 is a million miles from the modern egalitarianism of Finland\u2019s schools. \u201cI am often asked by people what is the most important thing I learned in school,\u201d Sahlberg says. \u201cI say that to learn to understand that there are different kinds of people in this world and that regardless where we come from we can be in same school and learn in same classroom.

In recent years, though, Taylor has missed a number of series at home and abroad as she manages her mental health, with the issue leading to her withdrawal from England\u2019s squad midway through this summer\u2019s Ashes. She has therefore decided to end an international career that started in August 2006 and comprised 10 Tests, 126 ODIs and 90 Twenty20s, the highlights of which include three Ashes series wins and World Cup triumphs in 2009 and 2017. Taylor said: \u201cThis has been a tough decision but I know it\u2019s the right one, for me and for my health moving forward. I am extremely proud of my career. I leave with my head held high and with excitement for what my future holds and what my next chapter brings.\u201d Taylor took an extended break from the game in 2016 but returned to play a pivotal part in England\u2019s World Cup win the following year, amassing 396 runs at an average of 49.5. Nobody in the women\u2019s game has affected more dismissals across all the formats than Taylor\u2019s 232. She added: \u201cPlaying for England and getting to wear the shirt for so long has been a dream come true and I have been blessed with so many great moments. From making my debut in 2006, to Ashes wins, and of course the World Cup final at Lord\u2019s, to name just a few. I\u2019ve also been blessed with travelling the world and making lifelong friends. I can\u2019t wait to see the heights that this team can reach.\u201d Guardian sport and agencies",

      "body": "<p>In the first two weeks of this month, as an autumn general election started to look more likely, 15 polls were carried out. They all aimed to do the same thing: estimate the support for each of Britain\u2019s political parties, by asking some version of, \u201cIf there were a general election tomorrow, whom would you vote for?\u201d Almost all put the Conservatives in the lead, with Labour in second place. But the polls disagreed on just how popular \u2013 or unpopular \u2013 those parties were. They put Tory support between 28% and 38%, while Labour ranged from 21% to 30% \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/10/boris-johnson-still-ahead-in-the-polls-but-by-how-much\" title=\"\">the difference between a chaotic hung parliament, say, and a solid Tory majority</a>.</p> <p>Of course, if polls all said the same thing, there wouldn\u2019t be so many of them. But when they vary so widely, what is the point of them? Over the last few years, as the polling industry has suffered a series of failures, that question has become more urgent. To recap: at the 2015 election, the polls didn\u2019t see the Tory majority coming. Two years later, most of them made the opposite mistake: predicting a Tory majority when we got a hung parliament. In between, came the EU referendum \u2013 where the polls weren\u2019t quite so far out, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/24/how-eu-referendum-pollsters-wrong-opinion-predict-close\" title=\"\">most</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/24/how-eu-referendum-pollsters-wrong-opinion-predict-close\" title=\"\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/24/how-eu-referendum-pollsters-wrong-opinion-predict-close\" title=\"\">put </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/24/how-eu-referendum-pollsters-wrong-opinion-predict-close\" title=\"\">remain ahead</a>.</p> <p>For their critics, these setbacks prove that polls are not an accurate way to read the popular mood. And those doubts have spread, something confirmed by the polls themselves. In 2017, <a href=\"https://www.ipsos.com/ipsos-mori/en-uk/trust-professions-long-term-trends\" title=\"\">Ipsos Mori found that 43% of people </a><a href=\"https://www.ipsos.com/ipsos-mori/en-uk/trust-professions-long-term-trends\" title=\"\">didn\u2019t trust pollsters</a> \u2013 an all-time high. The industry has come under fire, too, for <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-06-25/brexit-big-short-how-pollsters-helped-hedge-funds-beat-the-crash\" title=\"\">selling the results of private polls to hedge funds</a> on the day of the referendum; these were used to make bets against the pound.</p> <p>But even if polls aren\u2019t always trusted, their findings are still cheered, lamented, disputed and weaponised. They shape the way journalists talk about parties and politics; they put leaders under pressure. This is why they are used by campaigners \u2013 groups such as People\u2019s Vote, which has commissioned a series of polls that highlight support for staying in the EU. Not that everyone is willing to accept the results. \u201cMy impression is that when people like poll findings, they seize on them and quote them,\u201d says Peter Kellner, the former president of YouGov. \u201cAnd when they don\u2019t like them, they say: \u2018Oh, they got the 2015 election wrong, they got the 2017 election wrong, it must be a load of bollocks.\u2019\u201d Pollsters themselves urge caution. \u201cPolls aren\u2019t magic; they can\u2019t predict the future,\u201d says Anthony Wells, YouGov\u2019s director of political research. \u201cBut, clearly, they are the only good way we\u2019ve got of measuring public opinion.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0b94a7d8db03eed3b439c931a4054a556b5eece1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0b94a7d8db03eed3b439c931a4054a556b5eece1/0_0_2504_1541/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Gove and Boris Johnson the day after winning the 2016 EU referendum\" width=\"1000\" height=\"615\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Gove and Boris Johnson the day after winning the 2016 EU referendum.

This is the strange position pollsters now find themselves in: the turbulence of the times may have caught them out, but it has also made us more dependent on them, as we struggle to decipher the country\u2019s thinking and what on earth might happen next.</p> <p>After two general elections and two referendums in five years, pollsters are as sick of elections as the rest of us. \u201cWe\u2019d like to get a rest sometime,\u201d says Gideon Skinner, the head of political research at Ipsos Mori. ICM\u2019s research director, Gregor Jackson, tells me that, if there were another high-profile failure,\u201cWe\u2019d have to be honest and ask if there is a long-term future for political polling \u2013 in the narrow sense of accurately predicting the results of general elections.\u201d When the next election comes, pollsters know they will face their biggest test yet.</p> <p>***</p> <p>On a miserable Saturday morning in July, I arrive at an Ipsos Mori call centre in Leith, Edinburgh. The main room \u2013 a sparse space overlooking a park \u2013 is filled with 50 people sitting at five banks of desks, each themed around a bright colour. Most of them are young: the call centre employs lots of students, as well as actors, musicians and comedians looking for casual work. They patiently make call after call.</p> <p>Like most polling firms, Ipsos Mori devotes the majority of its work to market research. But I am here to sit in on telephone polling for its monthly <a href=\"https://www.ipsos.com/ipsos-mori/en-uk/political-monitor-archive\" title=\"\">Political Monitor</a>: a voting-intention poll, with additional questions about respondents\u2019 political views. This is the most high-profile work the firms carry out, often commissioned by newspapers, but it is also the least lucrative. \u201cMost companies use it as a shop window to build their name,\u201d says Deborah Mattinson, who runs the research consultancy Britain Thinks.</p> <p>For its phone polls, Ipsos Mori calls a mixture of landlines and mobiles that have been selected at random. What surprises me, sitting in the call centre, is just how hard it is to convince people to participate. \u201cThat\u2019s actually the biggest problem we have,\u201d says Ian Douglas, a cheery man with white hair, who is the firm\u2019s director of telephone project management. What has made phone polling increasingly challenging is \u201cthe number of people you have to convince it\u2019s not a PPI call\u201d, he says. Sometimes they slam down the phone or shout abuse. Interviewers are only expected to complete one 15-minute interview each hour; the rest of the time, they are being turned down or ignored.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The data shows increasing polarisation around Johnson. He is off-putting for many now in a way he wasn\u2019t three years ago</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Once they find someone willing to take part, the interviewers launch into their script: a set of questions written by Ipsos Mori\u2019s political team in London. They can\u2019t do anything that might influence the answers, like engage with an interviewee\u2019s jokes or political asides, so some interviewers resort to a stiff, robotic delivery. Others make an effort to keep the interviews lively: one young man with jaunty diction, emphasises different words as he sets out the options on whether Britain will leave the EU without a deal: \u201cWould you say it\u2019s <em>very</em> unlikely, <em>fairly</em> unlikely\u2026\u201d It reminds me of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?.</p> <p>A voting-intention poll is usually based on interviews with between 1,000 and 2,000 people. But they can\u2019t just be the first 1,000 who agree to take part \u2013 pollsters need a sample that is representative of the whole country. \u201cThe traditional analogy is eating a cake,\u201d says Skinner. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to eat the whole cake, you just need to get a good slice.\u201d That means having the right proportion of men and women, 18- to 24-year-olds and over-65s, Scots and Londoners. So, pollsters set quotas for those different categories. Douglas tells me that it is easiest to persuade people over 45 who live in Scotland, Wales or the north of England to take part. It can take four or five days of polling to fill the final quota: 18- to 24-year-old men. They have learned that there are particular times when it is easiest to reach younger age groups: earlier in the week or Saturday mornings. When I arrive, at 11am on a Saturday, the main room is filled with the hubbub of interviewing. But as morning blurs into afternoon, it becomes quieter; by the time I leave, it is almost silent.</p> <p>It is no surprise, then, that almost all voting-intention polls now take place online. It is cheaper, easier and quicker. Each agency has its own online panel: a group of people \u2013 more than 800,000, in the case of YouGov\u2019s UK panel \u2013 who have agreed to take part in surveys, on politics or anything else, in exchange for a small payment.</p> <p>Online polls have quotas to be filled, just like telephone polls. But it is hard to hit every one. So, once the polling has finished, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/13/political-poll-results-polling-industry-data\" title=\"\">pollsters adjust their results through a process known as weighting</a>: if they needed to poll 120 people aged 25 to 34, but could find only 100, for example, they will make each response in that age group count for 1.2 people.</p> <p>Polling firms weight their results for turnout, too: they take into account what someone says about how likely they are to vote or whether they voted in the previous election. It is this weighting that explains why pollsters can get such different results. \u201cThey\u2019ve got a choice of levers to pull,\u201d says Patrick Sturgis, a professor at the London School of Economics <a href=\"http://eprints.ncrm.ac.uk/3789/1/Report_final_revised.pdf\" title=\"\">who led an independent inquiry</a> into why the polling for the 2015 election went so wrong. \u201cThey pull a certain set of levers and it gives the Tories a five-point lead; they pull a different set and it gives the Tories a two-point lead.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5aead9c248d52432cfed944b4dd4c58cc3ea5566\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5aead9c248d52432cfed944b4dd4c58cc3ea5566/30_0_4063_2437/1000.jpg\" alt=\"British Prime Minister Theresa May outside 10 Downing Street in London in April 2017, announcing that she will call for a snap general election for 08 June.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Theresa May calls for a general election on 8 June 2017, encouraged by polls predicting a healthy majority.

So, if a sample had the right proportion of working-class and middle-class people, pollsters had a decent chance of predicting an election accurately. That is no longer the case. \u201cIf you\u2019re middle class, you\u2019re only very slightly more likely to be Conservative than if you\u2019re working class,\u201d says Kellner. \u201cIf you\u2019re working class, you\u2019re only very slightly more likely to be Labour than if you\u2019re middle class.\u201d</p> <p>The things that determine how people vote are always changing: to get a representative sample, pollsters must now pay particular attention to age, education, and, of course, views on Brexit. \u201cThe leave/remain camps have almost redefined how politics is seen,\u201d says Tanya Abraham, who works on YouGov\u2019s political team. \u201cBecause they can be any voter.\u201d James Kanagasooriam, a partner in charge of polling at the lobbying firm Hanbury Strategy, tells me that the two traditional voting blocs have now fragmented into four groups of roughly equal size: as well as traditional Labour and Tory supporters, there is a coalition of liberal, metropolitan, remain-leaning voters, as well as core Brexit supporters. Leave voters can now back the Brexit party, remainers the Lib Dems.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The traditional voting-intention poll is actually rubbish: two questions to get at increasingly complicated information</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cIn my professional life, I\u2019ve never known a time when voters have been so promiscuous with their votes,\u201d says Andrew Hawkins, the founder of ComRes. ICM\u2019s Jackson says: \u201cHaving a four-party system \u2013 and in particular the existence of the Brexit party \u2013 just makes it more difficult for polling agencies.\u201d Most polling firms weight their data according to how people voted in the previous general election \u2013 but it is impossible to weight by a vote for the Brexit party, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2019/apr/12/no-more-mr-nice-guy-nigel-farage-launches-brexit-party-video\" title=\"\">because it </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2019/apr/12/no-more-mr-nice-guy-nigel-farage-launches-brexit-party-video\" title=\"\">only launched in April</a>.</p> <p>It is even harder to predict what will happen in a general election, because it is dependent on whether Brexit happens before it takes place. \u201cIf we have left, and we haven\u2019t run out of mangetout at Waitrose and people aren\u2019t dying because they\u2019re unable to get the right drugs, then I suspect there\u2019d be a fillip in the polls for the Tories,\u201d Hawkins says. If we don\u2019t leave on 31 October, he suggests, the Conservatives will be in a much trickier position. Meanwhile, Jackson says: \u201cThe polling data is showing increasing polarisation in British views towards Boris Johnson. He\u2019s off-putting for many people now, in a way he wasn\u2019t three years ago.\u201d</p> <p>With so much fragmentation, no party looks likely to win a big majority \u2013 and when an election is tight there is little room for error. (A voting-intention poll has a margin of error typically understood to be three percentage points \u2013 if a poll puts the Conservatives on 33%, the party could be as low as 30% or as high as 36% \u2013 but this is often overlooked in the coverage.) \u201cIf you\u2019re two points out when it\u2019s close, you get it in the neck,\u201d says Hawkins. \u201cIf you\u2019re two points out when it\u2019s not close, you don\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>Andrew Cooper is one of British polling\u2019s grandees. The founder of Populus, he spent two years as David Cameron\u2019s director of strategy at No 10. Like many firms, Populus did not come out of the 2015 election well. After that shock, Cooper resolved not to be caught out again. \u201cWe did a very, very thorough review,\u201d he says. \u201cIt took lots of time, money and intellectual effort.\u201d Eventually, Populus made a number of changes: it started weighting according to how interested people were in politics, for instance, rather than how they identified politically; to estimate turnout, it took into account demographic factors, and interviewees\u2019 attitudes, in order to determine how likely different groups were to vote.</p> <p>The 2016 referendum was its chance to put its new methodology to the test: the day before the vote, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/yougov-polling-blog/2016/jun/23/last-minute-polling-data-on-eu-referendum\" title=\"\">it published a poll putting </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/yougov-polling-blog/2016/jun/23/last-minute-polling-data-on-eu-referendum\" title=\"\">remain on 55%</a>. \u201cThat poll was the wrongest of them,\u201d Cooper says flatly. Populus had made the same mistake as many firms: it underestimated just how many people who didn\u2019t normally vote would turn out. The experience was doubly bruising for Cooper, as he was the official pollster on the remain campaign.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"bcb9ea2b311d83bfc040cae01ace95768b19bbf8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bcb9ea2b311d83bfc040cae01ace95768b19bbf8/1228_332_2100_2050/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nailing jelly to the wall for piece on polling\" width=\"1000\" height=\"976\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018You have to convince people it\u2019s not a PPI call.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lol Keegan/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This time there would be no attempt to put things right. \u201cWe came to the conclusion that the underlying methodological problems of voting-intention polls are so fundamental that we can\u2019t solve them,\u201d Cooper says. So that was that: since the referendum, Populus hasn\u2019t carried out a single voting-intention poll. Instead, using data analytics, it looks at what Cooper describes as \u201cthe structure of political attitudes\u201d \u2013 the patterns behind public opinion. (Similarly, while the Guardian continues to use ICM to carry out polls, the paper has shifted its focus to more <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/dec/02/revealed-the-stark-evidence-of-everyday-racial-bias-in-britain\" title=\"\">in-depth research about public views and attitudes</a>.)</p> <p>\u201cThe traditional voting-intention poll is actually just a rubbish product,\u201d adds Cooper. \u201cIt\u2019s an attempt, by asking only two questions, to get at what is getting to be an increasingly complicated piece of information.\u201d</p> <p>This is the kind of statement one might expect to hear from a polling sceptic \u2013 someone such as Labour peer David Lipsey, who chaired a House of Lords committee <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/lords-select/political-polling-digital-media/news-parliament-2017/political-polling-report-published/\" title=\"\">that last year produced a critical report</a> on political polling. It called for more oversight and suggested the media give less attention to voting-intention polls; at the time, Lipsey urged the industry to \u201cget its house in order\u201d. I meet him at his office, across the road from the House of Lords in Westminster. Protesters are gathered near his window; as a man repeatedly yells \u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d, it feels as if public opinion is intruding very literally into our conversation.</p> <p>If anything, Lipsey is surprised that the polling industry hasn\u2019t attracted more hostile criticism. It wasn\u2019t just the recent errors, he says, pointing to the election of 1992, when the polls mistakenly put Labour ahead, and to 1997 and 2001, when they hugely overestimated Labour\u2019s lead. \u201cIn any case, if I predicted election results with a pin, I\u2019d get it right half the time,\u201d he says. Polling does have its uses, he concedes: it is effective at broadly gauging views on a wide range of subjects. But \u201cthe worst thing to use it for is predicting the results of elections.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Polls reflect more emotional politics: leave\u2019s \u2018take back control\u2019 had twice the resonance of remain\u2019s economy warnings</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Despite all the challenges that political polling faces, new players are still entering the industry. Last year, two veteran pollsters, Joe Twyman and Martin Boon, set up their own firm, <a href=\"http://www.deltapoll.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Deltapoll</a>. They thought politics was becoming more emotional, and that this was key to understanding how voters felt.</p> <p>Delta uses something it calls \u201cemotional resonance scoring\u201d (ERS). A traditional poll might ask someone how far they agree with a statement; ERS tries to determine the intensity of their feeling, by measuring how quickly \u2013 and therefore how emphatically \u2013 they respond to it. Twyman gives the example of the EU referendum: polling showed that about as many people agreed with the remain campaign\u2019s warnings about the economy as they did with leave\u2019s \u201ctake back control\u201d message; but ERS found the latter had twice the emotional resonance.</p> <p>For now, Delta uses ERS to test the strength of voters\u2019 feelings on politicians and parties; eventually, Twyman says, it will offer a new way of measuring voting intention.</p> <p>Other firms are also experimenting with cutting-edge techniques to complement traditional methods. They show people speeches by politicians, then measure their heart rate or monitor their facial expressions, which are then recorded using a webcam and analysed by an algorithm to see how intensely they react to the different messages. But when I speak to people in the industry, the development they appear to be most excited about is a kind of modelling called multilevel regression and post-stratification (MRP), which YouGov used in the 2017 general election. Traditional voting-intention polls give you each party\u2019s share of the vote for the country as a whole, rather than telling you how many seats they will get. But MRP enables polling firms to forecast election results on a constituency-by-constituency basis.</p> <p>In 2017, <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2017/05/31/how-yougov-model-2017-general-election-works\" title=\"\">YouGov polled </a><a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2017/05/31/how-yougov-model-2017-general-election-works\" title=\"\">about 50,000 voters a week</a>, across the country. With those results, it created different voter types \u2013 a male professional in his early 40s who backed the Conservatives last time, say, or a female student voting for the first time \u2013 and calculated how likely each of those types were to back each party. By estimating how many people in each voter type lived in a constituency, it was able to forecast a result for every seat. And it worked, mostly: <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2017/06/09/how-yougovs-election-model-compares-final-result\" title=\"\">the model called 93% of seats correctly</a>. When I ask Abraham how she felt that night watching the results come in, she sounds buoyant. \u201cGreat, actually,\u201d she says. \u201cEveryone just breathed a massive sigh of relief.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2bdc39c946d1a37ebee299232c0cdc62d4aa6450\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2bdc39c946d1a37ebee299232c0cdc62d4aa6450/22_27_3478_2034/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The prime minister tells press he\u2019d \u2018rather be dead in a ditch\u2019 than delay Brexit, against a backdrop of West Yorkshire police officers, 5 September 2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"585\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The prime minister tells press he\u2019d \u2018rather be dead in a ditch\u2019 than delay Brexit, against a backdrop of West Yorkshire police officers, earlier this month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At least political pollsters can take comfort from the fact that voting-intention polls are only a small part of their work. Kanagasooriam compares it to the tip of an iceberg. The real value of polling, he tells me, lies in all the other data. \u201cWhy do people vote a certain way? Who\u2019s voting? Where they are on the issues, where they are on the parties, where they are on individuals, on messages.\u201d He believes that, for all the emphasis on Brexit, voters continue to care about what they have always cared about: which party they trust to look after the economy; and which leader they like most.</p> <p>Of everyone I speak to, Kanagasooriam seems the most enthusiastic about what polling can achieve. He energetically describes to me the sophisticated insights offered by data science. It doesn\u2019t matter, he insists, that polling often fails to predict election results, because it keeps getting better at understanding what drives voters \u2013 and, at a time of upheaval, politicians need that information more than ever. He points to the Johnson government\u2019s emphasis on tackling crime and investing in the NHS and the rest of the public sector \u2013 issues that have, over the past few years, ranked among voters\u2019 top priorities. \u201cThis is the first time we have seen an administration actually pivot towards the things that matter for voters.\u201d That\u2019s the kind of impact polling can have, he suggests. \u201cThis is what affects stuff in Westminster.\u201d</p> <p>But voting-intention polls can affect Westminster, too. In 2014, 12 days before the Scottish referendum, <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2014/09/06/latest-scottish-referendum-poll-yes-lead\" title=\"\">the Sunday Times ran a YouGov poll showing a two-point lead for independence</a>. It was only one poll \u2013 an outlier \u2013 but it rattled Britain\u2019s political establishment and compelled David Cameron to launch a final intervention: he promised to give the Scottish parliament more powers if Scotland voted to stay in the UK. And it was encouraging polls in the early months of 2017 that helped convince Theresa May to call a general election, with disastrous consequences.</p> <p>Listening in at the call centre feels, at times, like being given a direct line to interviewees\u2019 thoughts. I wonder if they can really be so sure of where they stand on everything. At the time of my visit, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/22/jo-swinson-elected-new-lib-dem-leader\" title=\"\">Jo Swinson</a> has been the Lib Dem leader for only five days, too soon for me to have an informed take on her as a potential prime minister, <a href=\"https://www.ipsos.com/ipsos-mori/en-uk/public-see-johnson-most-capable-pm-vs-corbyn-ipsos-mori-political-monitor-july-2019\" title=\"\">but on the phones, 22% of respondents</a> say they strongly disagree that she could be good at running the country.</p> <p>Even after a long career in polling, Ipsos Mori\u2019s Douglas still seems fascinated by what each person has to say. \u201cYour family and friends are a closed network \u2013 they usually have a lot of the same views,\u201d he says, as we sit in Leith, dozens of his colleagues on the phone, hundreds of miles away from people at the other end of the line. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to think it\u2019s what the rest of the country is thinking, but often it\u2019s not.\u201d While we listen to interviews, he marvels at each surprising response. \u201cThe great British public tend to absolutely amaze you, time and time again.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email <a href=\"mailto:\" title=\"\">weekend@theguardian.com</a>, including your name and address (not for publication).</p>",

      "bodyText": "In the first two weeks of this month, as an autumn general election started to look more likely, 15 polls were carried out. They all aimed to do the same thing: estimate the support for each of Britain\u2019s political parties, by asking some version of, \u201cIf there were a general election tomorrow, whom would you vote for?\u201d Almost all put the Conservatives in the lead, with Labour in second place. But the polls disagreed on just how popular \u2013 or unpopular \u2013 those parties were. They put Tory support between 28% and 38%, while Labour ranged from 21% to 30% \u2013 the difference between a chaotic hung parliament, say, and a solid Tory majority. Of course, if polls all said the same thing, there wouldn\u2019t be so many of them. But when they vary so widely, what is the point of them? Over the last few years, as the polling industry has suffered a series of failures, that question has become more urgent. To recap: at the 2015 election, the polls didn\u2019t see the Tory majority coming. Two years later, most of them made the opposite mistake: predicting a Tory majority when we got a hung parliament. In between, came the EU referendum \u2013 where the polls weren\u2019t quite so far out, but most put remain ahead. For their critics, these setbacks prove that polls are not an accurate way to read the popular mood. And those doubts have spread, something confirmed by the polls themselves. In 2017, Ipsos Mori found that 43% of people didn\u2019t trust pollsters \u2013 an all-time high. The industry has come under fire, too, for selling the results of private polls to hedge funds on the day of the referendum; these were used to make bets against the pound. But even if polls aren\u2019t always trusted, their findings are still cheered, lamented, disputed and weaponised. They shape the way journalists talk about parties and politics; they put leaders under pressure. This is why they are used by campaigners \u2013 groups such as People\u2019s Vote, which has commissioned a series of polls that highlight support for staying in the EU. Not that everyone is willing to accept the results. \u201cMy impression is that when people like poll findings, they seize on them and quote them,\u201d says Peter Kellner, the former president of YouGov. \u201cAnd when they don\u2019t like them, they say: \u2018Oh, they got the 2015 election wrong, they got the 2017 election wrong, it must be a load of bollocks.\u2019\u201d Pollsters themselves urge caution. \u201cPolls aren\u2019t magic; they can\u2019t predict the future,\u201d says Anthony Wells, YouGov\u2019s director of political research. \u201cBut, clearly, they are the only good way we\u2019ve got of measuring public opinion.\u201d And the polls keep coming. This is the strange position pollsters now find themselves in: the turbulence of the times may have caught them out, but it has also made us more dependent on them, as we struggle to decipher the country\u2019s thinking and what on earth might happen next. After two general elections and two referendums in five years, pollsters are as sick of elections as the rest of us. \u201cWe\u2019d like to get a rest sometime,\u201d says Gideon Skinner, the head of political research at Ipsos Mori. ICM\u2019s research director, Gregor Jackson, tells me that, if there were another high-profile failure,\u201cWe\u2019d have to be honest and ask if there is a long-term future for political polling \u2013 in the narrow sense of accurately predicting the results of general elections.\u201d When the next election comes, pollsters know they will face their biggest test yet. *** On a miserable Saturday morning in July, I arrive at an Ipsos Mori call centre in Leith, Edinburgh. The main room \u2013 a sparse space overlooking a park \u2013 is filled with 50 people sitting at five banks of desks, each themed around a bright colour. Most of them are young: the call centre employs lots of students, as well as actors, musicians and comedians looking for casual work. They patiently make call after call. Like most polling firms, Ipsos Mori devotes the majority of its work to market research. But I am here to sit in on telephone polling for its monthly Political Monitor: a voting-intention poll, with additional questions about respondents\u2019 political views. This is the most high-profile work the firms carry out, often commissioned by newspapers, but it is also the least lucrative. \u201cMost companies use it as a shop window to build their name,\u201d says Deborah Mattinson, who runs the research consultancy Britain Thinks. For its phone polls, Ipsos Mori calls a mixture of landlines and mobiles that have been selected at random. What surprises me, sitting in the call centre, is just how hard it is to convince people to participate. \u201cThat\u2019s actually the biggest problem we have,\u201d says Ian Douglas, a cheery man with white hair, who is the firm\u2019s director of telephone project management. What has made phone polling increasingly challenging is \u201cthe number of people you have to convince it\u2019s not a PPI call\u201d, he says. Sometimes they slam down the phone or shout abuse. Interviewers are only expected to complete one 15-minute interview each hour; the rest of the time, they are being turned down or ignored. Once they find someone willing to take part, the interviewers launch into their script: a set of questions written by Ipsos Mori\u2019s political team in London. They can\u2019t do anything that might influence the answers, like engage with an interviewee\u2019s jokes or political asides, so some interviewers resort to a stiff, robotic delivery. Others make an effort to keep the interviews lively: one young man with jaunty diction, emphasises different words as he sets out the options on whether Britain will leave the EU without a deal: \u201cWould you say it\u2019s very unlikely, fairly unlikely\u2026\u201d It reminds me of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?. A voting-intention poll is usually based on interviews with between 1,000 and 2,000 people. But they can\u2019t just be the first 1,000 who agree to take part \u2013 pollsters need a sample that is representative of the whole country. \u201cThe traditional analogy is eating a cake,\u201d says Skinner. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to eat the whole cake, you just need to get a good slice.\u201d That means having the right proportion of men and women, 18- to 24-year-olds and over-65s, Scots and Londoners. So, pollsters set quotas for those different categories. Douglas tells me that it is easiest to persuade people over 45 who live in Scotland, Wales or the north of England to take part. It can take four or five days of polling to fill the final quota: 18- to 24-year-old men. They have learned that there are particular times when it is easiest to reach younger age groups: earlier in the week or Saturday mornings. When I arrive, at 11am on a Saturday, the main room is filled with the hubbub of interviewing. But as morning blurs into afternoon, it becomes quieter; by the time I leave, it is almost silent. It is no surprise, then, that almost all voting-intention polls now take place online. It is cheaper, easier and quicker. Each agency has its own online panel: a group of people \u2013 more than 800,000, in the case of YouGov\u2019s UK panel \u2013 who have agreed to take part in surveys, on politics or anything else, in exchange for a small payment. Online polls have quotas to be filled, just like telephone polls. But it is hard to hit every one. So, once the polling has finished, pollsters adjust their results through a process known as weighting: if they needed to poll 120 people aged 25 to 34, but could find only 100, for example, they will make each response in that age group count for 1.2 people. Polling firms weight their results for turnout, too: they take into account what someone says about how likely they are to vote or whether they voted in the previous election. It is this weighting that explains why pollsters can get such different results. \u201cThey\u2019ve got a choice of levers to pull,\u201d says Patrick Sturgis, a professor at the London School of Economics who led an independent inquiry into why the polling for the 2015 election went so wrong. \u201cThey pull a certain set of levers and it gives the Tories a five-point lead; they pull a different set and it gives the Tories a two-point lead.\u201d For decades, voters were split into two main groups \u2013 Labour and Conservative \u2013 divided by class. \u201cFifty, 60 years ago, most working-class voters voted Labour, most middle-class voters voted Conservative,\u201d says YouGov\u2019s Kellner. So, if a sample had the right proportion of working-class and middle-class people, pollsters had a decent chance of predicting an election accurately. That is no longer the case. \u201cIf you\u2019re middle class, you\u2019re only very slightly more likely to be Conservative than if you\u2019re working class,\u201d says Kellner. \u201cIf you\u2019re working class, you\u2019re only very slightly more likely to be Labour than if you\u2019re middle class.\u201d The things that determine how people vote are always changing: to get a representative sample, pollsters must now pay particular attention to age, education, and, of course, views on Brexit. \u201cThe leave/remain camps have almost redefined how politics is seen,\u201d says Tanya Abraham, who works on YouGov\u2019s political team. \u201cBecause they can be any voter.\u201d James Kanagasooriam, a partner in charge of polling at the lobbying firm Hanbury Strategy, tells me that the two traditional voting blocs have now fragmented into four groups of roughly equal size: as well as traditional Labour and Tory supporters, there is a coalition of liberal, metropolitan, remain-leaning voters, as well as core Brexit supporters. Leave voters can now back the Brexit party, remainers the Lib Dems. \u201cIn my professional life, I\u2019ve never known a time when voters have been so promiscuous with their votes,\u201d says Andrew Hawkins, the founder of ComRes. ICM\u2019s Jackson says: \u201cHaving a four-party system \u2013 and in particular the existence of the Brexit party \u2013 just makes it more difficult for polling agencies.\u201d Most polling firms weight their data according to how people voted in the previous general election \u2013 but it is impossible to weight by a vote for the Brexit party, because it only launched in April. It is even harder to predict what will happen in a general election, because it is dependent on whether Brexit happens before it takes place. \u201cIf we have left, and we haven\u2019t run out of mangetout at Waitrose and people aren\u2019t dying because they\u2019re unable to get the right drugs, then I suspect there\u2019d be a fillip in the polls for the Tories,\u201d Hawkins says. If we don\u2019t leave on 31 October, he suggests, the Conservatives will be in a much trickier position. Meanwhile, Jackson says: \u201cThe polling data is showing increasing polarisation in British views towards Boris Johnson. He\u2019s off-putting for many people now, in a way he wasn\u2019t three years ago.\u201d With so much fragmentation, no party looks likely to win a big majority \u2013 and when an election is tight there is little room for error. (A voting-intention poll has a margin of error typically understood to be three percentage points \u2013 if a poll puts the Conservatives on 33%, the party could be as low as 30% or as high as 36% \u2013 but this is often overlooked in the coverage.) \u201cIf you\u2019re two points out when it\u2019s close, you get it in the neck,\u201d says Hawkins. \u201cIf you\u2019re two points out when it\u2019s not close, you don\u2019t.\u201d *** Andrew Cooper is one of British polling\u2019s grandees. The founder of Populus, he spent two years as David Cameron\u2019s director of strategy at No 10. Like many firms, Populus did not come out of the 2015 election well. After that shock, Cooper resolved not to be caught out again. \u201cWe did a very, very thorough review,\u201d he says. \u201cIt took lots of time, money and intellectual effort.\u201d Eventually, Populus made a number of changes: it started weighting according to how interested people were in politics, for instance, rather than how they identified politically; to estimate turnout, it took into account demographic factors, and interviewees\u2019 attitudes, in order to determine how likely different groups were to vote. The 2016 referendum was its chance to put its new methodology to the test: the day before the vote, it published a poll putting remain on 55%. \u201cThat poll was the wrongest of them,\u201d Cooper says flatly. Populus had made the same mistake as many firms: it underestimated just how many people who didn\u2019t normally vote would turn out. The experience was doubly bruising for Cooper, as he was the official pollster on the remain campaign. This time there would be no attempt to put things right. \u201cWe came to the conclusion that the underlying methodological problems of voting-intention polls are so fundamental that we can\u2019t solve them,\u201d Cooper says. So that was that: since the referendum, Populus hasn\u2019t carried out a single voting-intention poll. Instead, using data analytics, it looks at what Cooper describes as \u201cthe structure of political attitudes\u201d \u2013 the patterns behind public opinion. (Similarly, while the Guardian continues to use ICM to carry out polls, the paper has shifted its focus to more in-depth research about public views and attitudes.) \u201cThe traditional voting-intention poll is actually just a rubbish product,\u201d adds Cooper. \u201cIt\u2019s an attempt, by asking only two questions, to get at what is getting to be an increasingly complicated piece of information.\u201d This is the kind of statement one might expect to hear from a polling sceptic \u2013 someone such as Labour peer David Lipsey, who chaired a House of Lords committee that last year produced a critical report on political polling. It called for more oversight and suggested the media give less attention to voting-intention polls; at the time, Lipsey urged the industry to \u201cget its house in order\u201d. I meet him at his office, across the road from the House of Lords in Westminster. Protesters are gathered near his window; as a man repeatedly yells \u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d, it feels as if public opinion is intruding very literally into our conversation. If anything, Lipsey is surprised that the polling industry hasn\u2019t attracted more hostile criticism. It wasn\u2019t just the recent errors, he says, pointing to the election of 1992, when the polls mistakenly put Labour ahead, and to 1997 and 2001, when they hugely overestimated Labour\u2019s lead. \u201cIn any case, if I predicted election results with a pin, I\u2019d get it right half the time,\u201d he says. Polling does have its uses, he concedes: it is effective at broadly gauging views on a wide range of subjects. But \u201cthe worst thing to use it for is predicting the results of elections.\u201d Despite all the challenges that political polling faces, new players are still entering the industry. Last year, two veteran pollsters, Joe Twyman and Martin Boon, set up their own firm, Deltapoll. They thought politics was becoming more emotional, and that this was key to understanding how voters felt. Delta uses something it calls \u201cemotional resonance scoring\u201d (ERS). A traditional poll might ask someone how far they agree with a statement; ERS tries to determine the intensity of their feeling, by measuring how quickly \u2013 and therefore how emphatically \u2013 they respond to it. Twyman gives the example of the EU referendum: polling showed that about as many people agreed with the remain campaign\u2019s warnings about the economy as they did with leave\u2019s \u201ctake back control\u201d message; but ERS found the latter had twice the emotional resonance. For now, Delta uses ERS to test the strength of voters\u2019 feelings on politicians and parties; eventually, Twyman says, it will offer a new way of measuring voting intention. Other firms are also experimenting with cutting-edge techniques to complement traditional methods. They show people speeches by politicians, then measure their heart rate or monitor their facial expressions, which are then recorded using a webcam and analysed by an algorithm to see how intensely they react to the different messages. But when I speak to people in the industry, the development they appear to be most excited about is a kind of modelling called multilevel regression and post-stratification (MRP), which YouGov used in the 2017 general election. Traditional voting-intention polls give you each party\u2019s share of the vote for the country as a whole, rather than telling you how many seats they will get. But MRP enables polling firms to forecast election results on a constituency-by-constituency basis. In 2017, YouGov polled about 50,000 voters a week, across the country. With those results, it created different voter types \u2013 a male professional in his early 40s who backed the Conservatives last time, say, or a female student voting for the first time \u2013 and calculated how likely each of those types were to back each party. By estimating how many people in each voter type lived in a constituency, it was able to forecast a result for every seat. And it worked, mostly: the model called 93% of seats correctly. When I ask Abraham how she felt that night watching the results come in, she sounds buoyant. \u201cGreat, actually,\u201d she says. \u201cEveryone just breathed a massive sigh of relief.\u201d At least political pollsters can take comfort from the fact that voting-intention polls are only a small part of their work. Kanagasooriam compares it to the tip of an iceberg. The real value of polling, he tells me, lies in all the other data. \u201cWhy do people vote a certain way? Who\u2019s voting? Where they are on the issues, where they are on the parties, where they are on individuals, on messages.\u201d He believes that, for all the emphasis on Brexit, voters continue to care about what they have always cared about: which party they trust to look after the economy; and which leader they like most. Of everyone I speak to, Kanagasooriam seems the most enthusiastic about what polling can achieve. He energetically describes to me the sophisticated insights offered by data science. It doesn\u2019t matter, he insists, that polling often fails to predict election results, because it keeps getting better at understanding what drives voters \u2013 and, at a time of upheaval, politicians need that information more than ever. He points to the Johnson government\u2019s emphasis on tackling crime and investing in the NHS and the rest of the public sector \u2013 issues that have, over the past few years, ranked among voters\u2019 top priorities. \u201cThis is the first time we have seen an administration actually pivot towards the things that matter for voters.\u201d That\u2019s the kind of impact polling can have, he suggests. \u201cThis is what affects stuff in Westminster.\u201d But voting-intention polls can affect Westminster, too. In 2014, 12 days before the Scottish referendum, the Sunday Times ran a YouGov poll showing a two-point lead for independence. It was only one poll \u2013 an outlier \u2013 but it rattled Britain\u2019s political establishment and compelled David Cameron to launch a final intervention: he promised to give the Scottish parliament more powers if Scotland voted to stay in the UK. And it was encouraging polls in the early months of 2017 that helped convince Theresa May to call a general election, with disastrous consequences. Listening in at the call centre feels, at times, like being given a direct line to interviewees\u2019 thoughts. I wonder if they can really be so sure of where they stand on everything. At the time of my visit, Jo Swinson has been the Lib Dem leader for only five days, too soon for me to have an informed take on her as a potential prime minister, but on the phones, 22% of respondents say they strongly disagree that she could be good at running the country. Even after a long career in polling, Ipsos Mori\u2019s Douglas still seems fascinated by what each person has to say. \u201cYour family and friends are a closed network \u2013 they usually have a lot of the same views,\u201d he says, as we sit in Leith, dozens of his colleagues on the phone, hundreds of miles away from people at the other end of the line. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to think it\u2019s what the rest of the country is thinking, but often it\u2019s not.\u201d While we listen to interviews, he marvels at each surprising response. \u201cThe great British public tend to absolutely amaze you, time and time again.\u201d \u2022 If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication).",

      "body": "<p>President Rodrigo Duterte\u2019s war on drugs and declaration of martial law in an island territory are being used as a pretext to attack people defending their land and environment in the Philippines, new research shows.</p> <p>The resource-rich archipelago in south-east Asia is the world\u2019s most murderous country for people who oppose logging, destructive mining and corrupt agribusiness. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jul/30/philippines-deadliest-country-defenders-environment-global-witness\">At least 30 </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jul/30/philippines-deadliest-country-defenders-environment-global-witness\">people were killed</a> in the Philippines last year, following 48 in 2017, dislodging Brazil from the top spot for the first time since the independent watchdog <a href=\"https://www.globalwitness.org/en-gb/\">Global Witness</a> began monitoring in 2012.</p> <p>In Palawan, illegal logging is the dark side of the tourism boom as the island province rushes to construct hotels and resorts. At least 12 local environmentalists have been murdered since 2004, including Ruben Arzaga, the head of El Nido village, who was <a href=\"https://www.rappler.com/nation/183126-cimatu-honor-killed-anti-logging-official-el-nido\">shot in September 2017</a> by illegal loggers.</p> <p>Global Witness said the threat against defenders in Palawan has escalated with Duterte\u2019s brutal campaign against illegal drugs. Some environmental activists have been named on a list of \u201cnarco-politicians\u201d created by Duterte\u2019s administration.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ba6ae4e94b33e3d7f58df4d6f4ca23a8a164dea9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ba6ae4e94b33e3d7f58df4d6f4ca23a8a164dea9/0_99_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ruben Arzaga (L), who was shot dead by illegal loggers\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ruben Arzaga (L), who was shot dead by illegal loggers in September 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karl Malakunas/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe president\u2019s brutal \u2018war on drugs\u2019 has fostered a culture of impunity and fear, emboldening the politically and economically powerful to use violence and hitmen against those they see as an obstacle or a threat,\u201d the report said.</p> <p>The report says the same is true for attacks against people opposing the coal industry, illegal mining, and corrupt agribusiness around the country. Many deaths involve armed men on motorcycles, the same modus operandi employed in the war on drugs.</p> <p>Global Witness said the militarisation of communities due to the declaration of martial law in Mindanao has also increased the danger for local land defenders. Almost half of the murders since Duterte assumed the presidency have taken place in the region.</p> <p>\u201cThe imposition of martial law on the island of Mindanao has empowered an army already known for protecting business projects and attacking those who oppose them,\u201d the report said.</p> <p>Global Witness said violence had got worse as the government continued to attract more investment into the region. Members of the army and paramilitaries are the suspects in almost three-quarters of the murders.</p> <p>Duterte declared martial law during the 2017 siege of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2018/may/22/marawi-one-year-siege-philippines-ghost-town-still-haunted-threat-isis\">Marawi City</a> by supporters of Islamic State. He kept extending it despite the end of the crisis, citing the need to eliminate terrorist cells operating in other parts of Mindanao.</p> <p>Global Witness said martial law was also used for the purposes of the military\u2019s drive against the communist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2019/apr/22/asias-longest-fighting-communist-guerrillas-philippines-in-pictures\">New People\u2019s Army</a> (NPA), which \u201cmay be operating in and around some of the rural communities opposed to abusive business projects\u201d.</p> <p>The research cited <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jul/21/philippines-lives-land-lost-coffee-empire-militarised-politics\">the 2017 massacre</a> of eight indigenous activists opposing a coffee plantation on their ancestral land in south Mindanao. The military claimed they were communist rebels killed in a legitimate encounter, but the Commission on Human Rights (CHR) disagreed and held two military commanders <a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1059656/chr-army-execs-liable-for-rights-violation\">liable for the killings</a>.</p> <p>The Philippines has laws in place to protect and uphold the right of communities to decide how their land and resources are used, but natural resources are often found in ancestral lands and indigenous peoples are frequently shortchanged or excluded in consultation processes. Conflicts then erupt between locals and intruding investors.</p> <p>The report also criticised funders such as the World Bank\u2019s International Finance Corporation, Standard Chartered and Mizuho Bank for financing projects and dealing with corporations linked to violence. It also called out countries such as the US for assisting the Philippine military, the UK for failing to insert a human rights element into its trade policy, and the EU for providing financial support to projects with human rights risks.</p> <p>The report, which serves as a midterm assessment of the Duterte government, called on the populist leader to take action against the killings in the remaining years of his presidency.</p> <p>\u201cLand and environmental activists will only be able to carry out their activism safely when Duterte\u2019s government and those doing business in the Philippines take action \u2013 as international law requires them to \u2013 to prevent land rights and environmental abuses, protect defenders at risk, and hold the perpetrators of intimidation and violence to account,\u201d the report said.</p> <p>However, the Philippine government dismissed the report. \u201cThe palace considers the UK-based group Global Witness as a purveyor of falsity and a subservient machinery for political propaganda,\u201d a spokesman for Duterte said.</p> <p>The CHR chair, Chito Gascon, confirmed attacks on environmental defenders were continuing. \u201cIt is unfortunate that rampant violence and criminal activity have gone unabated over several years, exacerbating a climate of impunity and injustice in this country. The [Global Witness] report focused on attacks on environmentalists and land rights advocates which is one of the several areas where the violence continues,\u201d Gascon said.</p> <p>\u201cWe call on law enforcement to do everything to end this violence and hold perpetrators to account.\u201d </p>",

      "bodyText": "President Rodrigo Duterte\u2019s war on drugs and declaration of martial law in an island territory are being used as a pretext to attack people defending their land and environment in the Philippines, new research shows. The resource-rich archipelago in south-east Asia is the world\u2019s most murderous country for people who oppose logging, destructive mining and corrupt agribusiness. At least 30 people were killed in the Philippines last year, following 48 in 2017, dislodging Brazil from the top spot for the first time since the independent watchdog Global Witness began monitoring in 2012. In Palawan, illegal logging is the dark side of the tourism boom as the island province rushes to construct hotels and resorts. At least 12 local environmentalists have been murdered since 2004, including Ruben Arzaga, the head of El Nido village, who was shot in September 2017 by illegal loggers. Global Witness said the threat against defenders in Palawan has escalated with Duterte\u2019s brutal campaign against illegal drugs. Some environmental activists have been named on a list of \u201cnarco-politicians\u201d created by Duterte\u2019s administration. \u201cThe president\u2019s brutal \u2018war on drugs\u2019 has fostered a culture of impunity and fear, emboldening the politically and economically powerful to use violence and hitmen against those they see as an obstacle or a threat,\u201d the report said. The report says the same is true for attacks against people opposing the coal industry, illegal mining, and corrupt agribusiness around the country. Many deaths involve armed men on motorcycles, the same modus operandi employed in the war on drugs. Global Witness said the militarisation of communities due to the declaration of martial law in Mindanao has also increased the danger for local land defenders. Almost half of the murders since Duterte assumed the presidency have taken place in the region. \u201cThe imposition of martial law on the island of Mindanao has empowered an army already known for protecting business projects and attacking those who oppose them,\u201d the report said. Global Witness said violence had got worse as the government continued to attract more investment into the region. Members of the army and paramilitaries are the suspects in almost three-quarters of the murders. Duterte declared martial law during the 2017 siege of Marawi City by supporters of Islamic State. He kept extending it despite the end of the crisis, citing the need to eliminate terrorist cells operating in other parts of Mindanao. Global Witness said martial law was also used for the purposes of the military\u2019s drive against the communist New People\u2019s Army (NPA), which \u201cmay be operating in and around some of the rural communities opposed to abusive business projects\u201d. The research cited the 2017 massacre of eight indigenous activists opposing a coffee plantation on their ancestral land in south Mindanao. The military claimed they were communist rebels killed in a legitimate encounter, but the Commission on Human Rights (CHR) disagreed and held two military commanders liable for the killings. The Philippines has laws in place to protect and uphold the right of communities to decide how their land and resources are used, but natural resources are often found in ancestral lands and indigenous peoples are frequently shortchanged or excluded in consultation processes. Conflicts then erupt between locals and intruding investors. The report also criticised funders such as the World Bank\u2019s International Finance Corporation, Standard Chartered and Mizuho Bank for financing projects and dealing with corporations linked to violence. It also called out countries such as the US for assisting the Philippine military, the UK for failing to insert a human rights element into its trade policy, and the EU for providing financial support to projects with human rights risks. The report, which serves as a midterm assessment of the Duterte government, called on the populist leader to take action against the killings in the remaining years of his presidency. \u201cLand and environmental activists will only be able to carry out their activism safely when Duterte\u2019s government and those doing business in the Philippines take action \u2013 as international law requires them to \u2013 to prevent land rights and environmental abuses, protect defenders at risk, and hold the perpetrators of intimidation and violence to account,\u201d the report said. However, the Philippine government dismissed the report. \u201cThe palace considers the UK-based group Global Witness as a purveyor of falsity and a subservient machinery for political propaganda,\u201d a spokesman for Duterte said. The CHR chair, Chito Gascon, confirmed attacks on environmental defenders were continuing. \u201cIt is unfortunate that rampant violence and criminal activity have gone unabated over several years, exacerbating a climate of impunity and injustice in this country. The [Global Witness] report focused on attacks on environmentalists and land rights advocates which is one of the several areas where the violence continues,\u201d Gascon said. \u201cWe call on law enforcement to do everything to end this violence and hold perpetrators to account.\u201d",

In a letter published in the Guardian, the actors Lenny Henry, Adrian Lester and David Harewood, and presenters Krishnan Guru-Murthy and Gillian Joseph are among signatories describing the decision as \u201cracially discriminatory treatment\u201d. It follows a backlash against the corporation on social media after the BBC Breakfast host Munchetty was found to have breached the corporation\u2019s editorial guidelines following criticism of Donald Trump for telling politicians of colour to \u201cgo home\u201d. Munchetty\u2019s co-host, Dan Walker, had asked her opinion after Trump tweeted in July that four congresswomen should \u201cgo back to the totally broken and crime-infested places from which they came\u201d. All four were people of colour, with only one born outside of the US. In response to Walker\u2019s question, Munchetty said: \u201cEvery time I have been told, as a woman of colour, to go back to where I came from, that was embedded in racism.\u201d She added that she was \u201cabsolutely furious a man in that position thinks it\u2019s OK to skirt the lines by using language like that\u201d. The BBC said Trump\u2019s remarks were widely condemned as racist, and Munchetty was entitled to give her personal response. However, its editorial complaints unit (ECU) found she had breached editorial guidelines because BBC journalists were not allowed to \u201cgive their opinions about the individual making the remarks or their motives for doing so\u201d. The letter to the BBC on Friday warns the decision will have a \u201cprofound effect on the future diversity within the BBC\u201d. It says requiring BAME broadcasters to remain \u201cimpartial\u201d about how they feel about their experiences of racism is \u201cludicrous\u201d and that to require them to \u201cendorse racism as a legitimate \u2018opinion\u2019 is an abrogation of responsibility of the most serious nature\u201d. The consequences of the decision are \u201cwidespread with implications for the entire media landscape in the UK\u201d, it says. The scope of its effect, the signatories say, is already evident in the \u201cunprecedented number of BAME media figures who have openly and publicly voiced their condemnation\u201d. The letter states that the ECU \u201cdoes not reflect the diverse cultural views in the BAME communities in the UK\u201d, and that it should address its own levels of diversity. It calls on BBC management to support journalists and acknowledge there can be no expectation of impartiality over expressions and experiences of racism. It says the ECU ruling failed to acknowledge that \u201cracism is not a valid opinion on which an \u2018impartial\u2019 stance can or should be maintained\u201d. For those who experience racist abuse, including Munchetty, \u201cbeing expected to treat racist ideas as potentially valid has devastating and maybe illegal consequences\u201d and is contrary to race equality and human rights legislation, it says. \u201cTo suggest a journalist can \u2018talk about her own experiences of racism\u2019 while withholding a critique on the author of racism (in this case President Trump) has the ludicrous implication that such racism may be legitimate and should be contemplated as such,\u201d it adds. The letter\u2019s signatories, who also include the broadcaster and writer Afua Hirsch and the science journalist Angela Saini, say that BBC journalists have contacted them privately to express concern about the \u201cclimate of fear\u201d at the organisation and concerns over the consequences of their speaking out in support of the statement. Among those who have also backed the presenter are the chancellor, Sajid Javid, who called the decision \u201cridiculous\u201d and added that Munchetty\u2019s reaction was \u201cperfectly understandable\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>Nearly two years ago, the artist and academic Jenny Odell gave a keynote address on \u201chow to do nothing\u201d. In it she talked about the impact of modern life\u2019s ceaseless demands on our time and attention, \u201ca situation where every waking moment has become pertinent to our making a living\u201d. And she discussed how she herself had found respite in nature.</p> <p>Her talk was written for the Eyeo festival in Minneapolis \u2013 described as for the \u201ccreative technology community\u201d and attended by the kind of blue-sky thinkers unlikely to balk at references to concepts like \u201cobservational eros\u201d. Yet, when the 10,000-word transcript <a href=\"https://medium.com/@the_jennitaur/how-to-do-nothing-57e100f59bbb\" title=\"\">was published online</a>, it went viral. Not only that: many people read it to the end.</p> <p>\u201cIt was really a surprise that it resonated with people outside of that pretty specific context, and that people would have the patience to read something that\u2019s 45 minutes long, online,\u201d says Odell, by phone from her home in Oakland, California. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten a lot of responses from people saying things like, \u2018you\u2019ve put words to a feeling that I\u2019ve had for a long time\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>That a lengthy online treatise about shattered attention spans should manage to hold so many of them is ironic, it reflects wider concern. Odell writes of feeling compelled to seek refuge in her local rose garden in the days after Donald Trump became president, \u201clike a deer going to a salt lick\u201d: \u201cIt really did feel necessary, like a survival tactic.\u201d</p> <p>She eventually understood the impulse in the words of the French philosopher, Gilles Deleuze: when we are \u201criddled with pointless talk, insane quantities of words and images\u201d, the challenge is to search for \u201clittle gaps of solitude and silence in which [to] find \u2026 the rare, and even rarer thing that might be worth saying\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e29682607b5b4b149fda7a7814a6a9ceb541ca3d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e29682607b5b4b149fda7a7814a6a9ceb541ca3d/0_0_3460_5190/667.jpg\" alt=\"Jenny Odell portrait upright\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jenny Odell ... felt compelled to seek refuge in her rose garden after Trump\u2019s election victory</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Provided by Jenny Odell</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If that was hard in 1985, when Deleuze was writing, it is next to impossible now. Technology, coupled with economic insecurity, has dissolved boundaries between work, rest and leisure. \u201cWhat we are left with,\u201d Odell writes, with no small sadness, \u201c[are] 24 potentially monetizeable hours \u2026 that we can no longer justify spending on \u2018nothing\u2019. It ...is simply too expensive.\u201d</p> <p>This \u201ccrisis\u201d forms the basis of Odell\u2019s new book, described as both a \u201ccritique of the forces vying for our attention\u201d and an action plan for how to resist them. As a title, How to Do Nothing sounds parodic \u2013 I felt a bit self-conscious reading it on the train. Who needs a book to know how to do nothing?</p> <p>Many of us, it turns out. In the 18-month turnaround from Odell\u2019s keynote to hardback \u2013 warp-speed, for the industry \u2013 publishing has become transfixed by our current way of life and the possibility of a different one, evidenced by Malcolm Harris\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34523218-kids-these-days\" title=\"\">Kids These Days</a>, a social critique of millennials as human capital, <a href=\"http://www.calnewport.com/books/digital-minimalism/\" title=\"\">Digital Minimalism</a> by Cal Newport, BuzzFeed journalist Anne Helen Petersen\u2019s forthcoming book on <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/annehelenpetersen/millennials-burnout-generation-debt-work\" title=\"\">\u201cmillennial burnout\u201d</a> , and another on \u201cthe art of rest\u201d <a href=\"https://canongate.co.uk/books/2475-the-art-of-rest-how-to-find-respite-in-the-modern-age/\" title=\"\">by Claudia Hammond</a>.</p> <p>Together, these books seem to denote a dawning, collective comprehension that \u201crather than establishing a set of rigorous habits, we may need to rethink our approach to life in general\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/04/29/what-it-takes-to-put-your-phone-away\" title=\"\">as the New Yorker\u2019s</a> Jia Tolentino recently put it (her own new essay collection also deals with these themes). And Odell seems to be proposing a solution.</p> <p>\u201cI mean, I hope so,\u201d she says. \u201cMy own experience was one of self-observation, which I think is happening to a lot of people right now \u2013 you can only do something that makes you feel so bad, for so long, without starting to ask why. The original talk came out of me wondering why I was going to the rose garden so often, and why that felt necessary \u2013 I think this cultural moment, this kind of reckoning that\u2019s happening, is maybe related.\u201d</p> <p>Many commentators have zeroed in on our relationship with technology as the source of the problem: Newport advocates a 30-day \u201cdigital declutter\u201d, while others suggest using apps to monitor or restrict screen time. But Odell sees that approach as too limited, not only inadequately isolating tech as the cause but also framing it as the answer. Her proposal is that we train ourselves to assume a different perspective, one that allows us to see familiar things in a new way and in the process find momentary relief.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I try to articulate it, it sounds really abstract, but I think it\u2019s actually very practical,\u201d Odell says. \u201cIf you think about your mindset when you go to a place you\u2019ve never been, especially on vacation, the way that you look at things is quite different than how you would normally look at things while on your way to work. A lot of what I\u2019m describing is trying to apply that same mindset to things that you\u2019ve seen many times \u2013 you will always be surprised.\u201d</p> <p>Many will recognise that slightly out-of-body sensation of being confronted by limitless possibilities in an unfamiliar place, and the refreshing, restorative effect it can have; the trick to surviving this modern world, Odell says, is to be able to access that plane as and when necessary. \u201cOnce in a while, I will go and stay in a cabin somewhere for a couple of days, but oftentimes that\u2019s not possible. With a lot of will and effort, you can do that without leaving \u2013 you can make a decision to look at everything a little bit off-kilter. If you just expand out from the 24-hour news cycle, the notifications, even a little bit, it no longer feels like just another day.\u201d</p> <p>Odell herself finds this state of mind most easily accessed in nature, losing herself in the study of a single leaf or patch of earth, or going on meandering hikes. \u201cI can\u2019t even call it a hike, because some of that is just me sitting on a rock or under a tree somewhere. I\u2019ll be on some other planet in my head, then I\u2019ll see some trail runners who clearly just got off work, and it\u2019s their exercise ... whereas I was having this almost psychedelic encounter with very specific plants.\u201d</p> <p>It is a kind of mindfulness that Odell is describing, albeit stripped of any connection to the wellness industry; the practice of simultaneously seeing more and zooming in with hyper-precision. \u201cI think it gets easier, the more you do it. But sometimes it\u2019s the really simple thing of just asking, \u2018OK, what in this scene have I not noticed before?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>A keen birdwatcher (or, as she puts it, \u201cbird-noticer\u201d), Odell recalls in great detail specific experiences in nature \u2013 happening upon a clearing full of sage plants and its \u201camazing smell\u201d, or seeing a \u201creally amazing warbler\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s not about, at the end of those five hours, thinking, \u2018I\u2019m so glad I got my heart rate up\u2019. Maybe I did, I don\u2019t actually know. But it\u2019s more that. When I got back to my car, it was like that time had just disappeared \u2013 it felt like it had been three days.\u201d It is further evidence of the importance of parks and green spaces in cities, she adds.</p> <p>Finding solace in nature is not a new idea, but its sense of escape is increasingly necessary for our survival, says Odell. She has previously likened it to \u201ca wastewater treatment for my brain\u201d \u2013 if not clearing it of \u201cdebris and noise and worry\u201d, at least making her conscious of it. \u201cYou really can\u2019t see it unless you step aside,\u201d she says now.</p> <p>Awareness \u2013 rather than change \u2013 may be the most we can hope for. <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/3/25/18280689/jenny-odell-how-to-do-nothing-interview-facebook-instagram\" title=\"\">Odell has said</a> How To Do Nothing is not a self-help book promising simple steps to a lasting new way of life : \u201cYou have to know that you\u2019re going to keep getting sucked back in, and be realistic about that.\u201d</p> <p>She hopes, however, that learning \u201chow to do nothing\u201d may serve as self-care in the original sense that Audre Lorde intended it - as a strategy of self-preservation for activism. With inattention at the root of inaction, complacency and even bias \u2013 she draws a link between her ideas and <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/05/unconscious-bias-training/525405/\" title=\"\">efforts to counter implicit racial prejudice</a> through teaching people \u201chow to see what they\u2019re not seeing\u201d. The mere investment of attention signals intention and invites returns. It is \u201cquite humbling\u201d, she says, to discover how much you have been missing.</p> <p>\u201cThat decision to pay attention to different things, or to ask those questions \u2013 to me, that\u2019s the beginning of free will. If, in that abstract mental space, you can be reminded that the decision is actually yours to make, that it wasn\u2019t made for you, I think that cascades into all the other areas of your life \u2013 like, for instance, using social media \u2013 where you actually have a choice, where you didn\u2019t think you had one.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/feb/18/burned-out-and-overwhelmed-should-you-embrace-the-joy-of-no\">Burned out and overwhelmed: should you embrace the joy of no?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But paying attention is not easy to do. It demands \u201ca state of openness that assumes there is something new to be seen\u201d, and the discipline to \u201cresist our tendency to declare our observations finished\u201d, writes Odell. What is necessary, she says, is refusal (she reimagines #fomo as \u201c#nomo, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/feb/18/burned-out-and-overwhelmed-should-you-embrace-the-joy-of-no\" title=\"\">the necessity of missing out\u201d</a>) and vigilance, guarding against the burnout or apathy that can result from extreme overstimulation. \u201cIf attention and will are so closely linked, then we have even more reason to worry about an entire economy and information ecosystem preying on our attention.\u201d</p> <p>Ironically, in the wake of Odell\u2019s book, it has been possible to observe those forces\u2019 magnetic pull in action. The social critiques in her keynote have subsequently been bundled in with Silicon Valley- style \u201clife hacks\u201d, such as the idea of meditating for productivity; or proposals to alleviate the effects of capitalism with more capitalism, by working harder or buying more. While mindfulness is often billed as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jun/14/the-mindfulness-conspiracy-capitalist-spirituality\" title=\"\">having the revolutionary power</a> to transform the world, Odell\u2019s book makes few promises beyond, perhaps, increased awareness and a possible coping strategy.

      "bodyText": "Nearly two years ago, the artist and academic Jenny Odell gave a keynote address on \u201chow to do nothing\u201d. In it she talked about the impact of modern life\u2019s ceaseless demands on our time and attention, \u201ca situation where every waking moment has become pertinent to our making a living\u201d. And she discussed how she herself had found respite in nature. Her talk was written for the Eyeo festival in Minneapolis \u2013 described as for the \u201ccreative technology community\u201d and attended by the kind of blue-sky thinkers unlikely to balk at references to concepts like \u201cobservational eros\u201d. Yet, when the 10,000-word transcript was published online, it went viral. Not only that: many people read it to the end. \u201cIt was really a surprise that it resonated with people outside of that pretty specific context, and that people would have the patience to read something that\u2019s 45 minutes long, online,\u201d says Odell, by phone from her home in Oakland, California. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten a lot of responses from people saying things like, \u2018you\u2019ve put words to a feeling that I\u2019ve had for a long time\u2019.\u201d That a lengthy online treatise about shattered attention spans should manage to hold so many of them is ironic, it reflects wider concern. Odell writes of feeling compelled to seek refuge in her local rose garden in the days after Donald Trump became president, \u201clike a deer going to a salt lick\u201d: \u201cIt really did feel necessary, like a survival tactic.\u201d She eventually understood the impulse in the words of the French philosopher, Gilles Deleuze: when we are \u201criddled with pointless talk, insane quantities of words and images\u201d, the challenge is to search for \u201clittle gaps of solitude and silence in which [to] find \u2026 the rare, and even rarer thing that might be worth saying\u201d. If that was hard in 1985, when Deleuze was writing, it is next to impossible now. Technology, coupled with economic insecurity, has dissolved boundaries between work, rest and leisure. \u201cWhat we are left with,\u201d Odell writes, with no small sadness, \u201c[are] 24 potentially monetizeable hours \u2026 that we can no longer justify spending on \u2018nothing\u2019. It ...is simply too expensive.\u201d This \u201ccrisis\u201d forms the basis of Odell\u2019s new book, described as both a \u201ccritique of the forces vying for our attention\u201d and an action plan for how to resist them. As a title, How to Do Nothing sounds parodic \u2013 I felt a bit self-conscious reading it on the train. Who needs a book to know how to do nothing? Many of us, it turns out. In the 18-month turnaround from Odell\u2019s keynote to hardback \u2013 warp-speed, for the industry \u2013 publishing has become transfixed by our current way of life and the possibility of a different one, evidenced by Malcolm Harris\u2019s Kids These Days, a social critique of millennials as human capital, Digital Minimalism by Cal Newport, BuzzFeed journalist Anne Helen Petersen\u2019s forthcoming book on \u201cmillennial burnout\u201d , and another on \u201cthe art of rest\u201d by Claudia Hammond. Together, these books seem to denote a dawning, collective comprehension that \u201crather than establishing a set of rigorous habits, we may need to rethink our approach to life in general\u201d, as the New Yorker\u2019s Jia Tolentino recently put it (her own new essay collection also deals with these themes). And Odell seems to be proposing a solution. \u201cI mean, I hope so,\u201d she says. \u201cMy own experience was one of self-observation, which I think is happening to a lot of people right now \u2013 you can only do something that makes you feel so bad, for so long, without starting to ask why. The original talk came out of me wondering why I was going to the rose garden so often, and why that felt necessary \u2013 I think this cultural moment, this kind of reckoning that\u2019s happening, is maybe related.\u201d Many commentators have zeroed in on our relationship with technology as the source of the problem: Newport advocates a 30-day \u201cdigital declutter\u201d, while others suggest using apps to monitor or restrict screen time. But Odell sees that approach as too limited, not only inadequately isolating tech as the cause but also framing it as the answer. Her proposal is that we train ourselves to assume a different perspective, one that allows us to see familiar things in a new way and in the process find momentary relief. \u201cWhen I try to articulate it, it sounds really abstract, but I think it\u2019s actually very practical,\u201d Odell says. \u201cIf you think about your mindset when you go to a place you\u2019ve never been, especially on vacation, the way that you look at things is quite different than how you would normally look at things while on your way to work. A lot of what I\u2019m describing is trying to apply that same mindset to things that you\u2019ve seen many times \u2013 you will always be surprised.\u201d Many will recognise that slightly out-of-body sensation of being confronted by limitless possibilities in an unfamiliar place, and the refreshing, restorative effect it can have; the trick to surviving this modern world, Odell says, is to be able to access that plane as and when necessary. \u201cOnce in a while, I will go and stay in a cabin somewhere for a couple of days, but oftentimes that\u2019s not possible. With a lot of will and effort, you can do that without leaving \u2013 you can make a decision to look at everything a little bit off-kilter. If you just expand out from the 24-hour news cycle, the notifications, even a little bit, it no longer feels like just another day.\u201d Odell herself finds this state of mind most easily accessed in nature, losing herself in the study of a single leaf or patch of earth, or going on meandering hikes. \u201cI can\u2019t even call it a hike, because some of that is just me sitting on a rock or under a tree somewhere. I\u2019ll be on some other planet in my head, then I\u2019ll see some trail runners who clearly just got off work, and it\u2019s their exercise ... whereas I was having this almost psychedelic encounter with very specific plants.\u201d It is a kind of mindfulness that Odell is describing, albeit stripped of any connection to the wellness industry; the practice of simultaneously seeing more and zooming in with hyper-precision. \u201cI think it gets easier, the more you do it. But sometimes it\u2019s the really simple thing of just asking, \u2018OK, what in this scene have I not noticed before?\u2019\u201d A keen birdwatcher (or, as she puts it, \u201cbird-noticer\u201d), Odell recalls in great detail specific experiences in nature \u2013 happening upon a clearing full of sage plants and its \u201camazing smell\u201d, or seeing a \u201creally amazing warbler\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s not about, at the end of those five hours, thinking, \u2018I\u2019m so glad I got my heart rate up\u2019. Maybe I did, I don\u2019t actually know. But it\u2019s more that. When I got back to my car, it was like that time had just disappeared \u2013 it felt like it had been three days.\u201d It is further evidence of the importance of parks and green spaces in cities, she adds. Finding solace in nature is not a new idea, but its sense of escape is increasingly necessary for our survival, says Odell. She has previously likened it to \u201ca wastewater treatment for my brain\u201d \u2013 if not clearing it of \u201cdebris and noise and worry\u201d, at least making her conscious of it. \u201cYou really can\u2019t see it unless you step aside,\u201d she says now. Awareness \u2013 rather than change \u2013 may be the most we can hope for. Odell has said How To Do Nothing is not a self-help book promising simple steps to a lasting new way of life : \u201cYou have to know that you\u2019re going to keep getting sucked back in, and be realistic about that.\u201d She hopes, however, that learning \u201chow to do nothing\u201d may serve as self-care in the original sense that Audre Lorde intended it - as a strategy of self-preservation for activism. With inattention at the root of inaction, complacency and even bias \u2013 she draws a link between her ideas and efforts to counter implicit racial prejudice through teaching people \u201chow to see what they\u2019re not seeing\u201d. The mere investment of attention signals intention and invites returns. It is \u201cquite humbling\u201d, she says, to discover how much you have been missing. \u201cThat decision to pay attention to different things, or to ask those questions \u2013 to me, that\u2019s the beginning of free will. If, in that abstract mental space, you can be reminded that the decision is actually yours to make, that it wasn\u2019t made for you, I think that cascades into all the other areas of your life \u2013 like, for instance, using social media \u2013 where you actually have a choice, where you didn\u2019t think you had one.\u201d But paying attention is not easy to do. It demands \u201ca state of openness that assumes there is something new to be seen\u201d, and the discipline to \u201cresist our tendency to declare our observations finished\u201d, writes Odell. What is necessary, she says, is refusal (she reimagines #fomo as \u201c#nomo, the necessity of missing out\u201d) and vigilance, guarding against the burnout or apathy that can result from extreme overstimulation. \u201cIf attention and will are so closely linked, then we have even more reason to worry about an entire economy and information ecosystem preying on our attention.\u201d Ironically, in the wake of Odell\u2019s book, it has been possible to observe those forces\u2019 magnetic pull in action. The social critiques in her keynote have subsequently been bundled in with Silicon Valley- style \u201clife hacks\u201d, such as the idea of meditating for productivity; or proposals to alleviate the effects of capitalism with more capitalism, by working harder or buying more. While mindfulness is often billed as having the revolutionary power to transform the world, Odell\u2019s book makes few promises beyond, perhaps, increased awareness and a possible coping strategy. But it is not hard to imagine her quite academic, unwieldy treatise being tidied up and repackaged as The Life-Changing Magic of Doing Nothing, assimilated by those forces for productivity it tries to resist. It may well be already happening. I catch myself asking Odell what she sees as the benefit or the outcome of doing nothing \u2013 is it increased creativity? Greater empathy, improved mental health? \u201cI think it could lead to any of those things, but I am careful not to instrumentalise it,\u201d she says. \u201cI am genuinely interested in nothing for the sake of nothing, rather than nothing for the sake of something. \u2026 Honestly, it will sound cheesy, but the impetus that is the most obvious for me is that it\u2019s a reminder that you\u2019re alive.\u201d \u2022 How to Do Nothing, by Jenny Odell, is published by Melville House Publishing (\u00a320).

The average driver in Brussels spends 85 hours a year stuck in traffic.</p> \n<p>A hitchhiking app that connects drivers who have spare seats to those without a ride is being developed by a start-up. The Brussels capital region government is in talks about promoting the service through its own official travel app, which, once launched, will bring together as many alternative modes of transport as possible.</p> \n<p>Local officials are coming under pressure from MPs to ensure that the model it promotes stays true to the original hitchhiking concept by ensuring there is no money exchanged, unlike in existing carpooling services.</p> \n<p>Julien Uyttendaele, an MP in the Brussels parliament whose Socialist party is part of the governing left-Green coalition, said that in part due to a rise of \u201cindividualism\u201d the practice of hitchhiking had fallen into disuse and that it would be a major step in the right direction to revive it.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe goal here is not to have a business logic like BlaBlaCar or UberPOP but to offer an app that would allow drivers to get in touch with passengers who want to share part of their journey for free,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cHitchhiking has become obsolete and the logic of bringing a stranger into the vehicle is considered insecure. But via new technologies, this measure would help in the fight against the damage we are inflicting upon ourselves.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cI think hitchhiking has come into disuse because we are more individualistic,\u201d Uyttendaele added. \u201cI take public transport but if I had a car, I would have no problem picking someone up from the street.

      "bodyText": "The act of thumbing a lift has been in and out of favour over the years, romanticised in great works of literature chronicling the travails of workers in the Great Depression or the young and cash-strapped seeking adventure in the second half of the last century. While it might no longer be the stuff of novels, there are signs in Belgium, at least, that the practice could be making a comeback \u2013 albeit in a digital form and with help from the authorities. Under plans being formulated by the local government in Brussels, commuters are set to be encouraged to hitchhike to work as part of efforts to free up what are among Europe\u2019s most congested roads. The average driver in Brussels spends 85 hours a year stuck in traffic. A hitchhiking app that connects drivers who have spare seats to those without a ride is being developed by a start-up. The Brussels capital region government is in talks about promoting the service through its own official travel app, which, once launched, will bring together as many alternative modes of transport as possible. Local officials are coming under pressure from MPs to ensure that the model it promotes stays true to the original hitchhiking concept by ensuring there is no money exchanged, unlike in existing carpooling services. Julien Uyttendaele, an MP in the Brussels parliament whose Socialist party is part of the governing left-Green coalition, said that in part due to a rise of \u201cindividualism\u201d the practice of hitchhiking had fallen into disuse and that it would be a major step in the right direction to revive it. \u201cThe goal here is not to have a business logic like BlaBlaCar or UberPOP but to offer an app that would allow drivers to get in touch with passengers who want to share part of their journey for free,\u201d he said. \u201cHitchhiking has become obsolete and the logic of bringing a stranger into the vehicle is considered insecure. But via new technologies, this measure would help in the fight against the damage we are inflicting upon ourselves.\u201d \u201cI think hitchhiking has come into disuse because we are more individualistic,\u201d Uyttendaele added. \u201cI take public transport but if I had a car, I would have no problem picking someone up from the street. Especially if now because of technology I know who that person is. I want this to be done by the administration or a non-profit association, not by a commercial organisation.\u201d The Brussels region\u2019s government wants to reduce the number of single-passenger cars on its roads by 20% \u2013 a target that would clear up traffic jams. It is creating its one-stop app to bring together all the possible alternative transport methods, and the minister for mobility, Elke Van den Brandt, told the Brussels parliament this week that an app in development that is seeking to \u201creinvigorate hitchhiking\u201d would be included. Pieterjan Desmet, from the minister\u2019s office, said the government elected in July was determined not to close its mind to any schemes that would ease congestion in Brussels. \u201cThe cabinet had a meeting with the developer,\u201d he said. \u201cThe economic model they propose is that people pay a fee of \u20ac5 to \u20ac10 to sign up to the app and they put the driver in touch with the person who needs a lift. The driver then can calculate how to share the cost of travelling but that is left to them to sort out among themselves\u201d. Recent studies suggest that Brussels is one of the most congested cities in Europe, if not the worst. Contributing factors to the problem include a corporate tradition of providing cars to employees, Belgians\u2019 propensity to commute into their main cities and the poor layout of orbital roads around Brussels. The Belgian capital\u2019s efforts to tackle congestion have also been hindered by its complicated structure of government, with the Brussels parliament needing to coordinate efforts with the federal, francophone Walloon, and Flemish authorities. Van den Brandt said that beyond clearing the roads, it was vital to act now as part of efforts to tackle the climate crisis. She said: \u201cWe have to look for what we have in common and find solutions together. Maybe it will not be easy, but we will talk.

Borland started working on Bunny in 2002 with a then unknown young actress called Gwendoline Christie. Excited by Christie\u2019s striking looks, Borland first planned to shoot her as a kind of Bunny Girl pinup, but thanks to the uncanny, mutating effects of stretchy hosiery, the project got odder and more animalistic.

Bourgeois used tights to form mutant bodies: stuffed as sausage-like limbs, stretched over metal frameworks to resemble female torsos, or strange, expressive, semi-human creatures.</p> <p>In her ongoing Bunny<em> </em>series, Lucas built on Bourgeois\u2019s mutant female stocking sculptures, using three pairs of stuffed tights stretched over a chair to suggest the body of a drunk (literally legless) woman whose supposedly sexy attire \u2013 stockings and bunny ears \u2013 look tawdry in the morning-after light of a gallery. Lucas\u2019s Bunnys are female bodies reduced to a few sexual signifiers: all stockings and stilettos. In her NUDS sculptures, stuffed tights stand in for human limbs of unspecified gender, twisting like fleshy serpents in a strangling, sensual embrace.</p> <p>As the title NUDS<em> </em>suggests, much of the sculptural impact of tights comes from their resemblance to human skin, and the body-like forms they offer. That of course depends on whose skin and whose body: until shockingly recently, the term \u201cnude\u201d in fashion indicated only a beige-pink colour.</p> <p>As brands making nude tights for women of colour (Sheer Chemistry, Bianca Miller, Nubian Skin) appeared on the British market, Enam Gbewonyo started \u201cto chart the history of hosiery and its relationship with black women. I thought about how this item of clothing had till then marginalised black women and how we are often made to feel invisible in the fashion and beauty markets.\u201d</p> <p>Her exploration led back to the days of slavery and empire, to the tights worn by black nurses on the NHS, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/apr/01/pointe-shoes-black-ballet-ballerinas-dancers\">the pink tights and shoes that black dancers were forced to wear</a> as a ballet \u201cnorm\u201d. Throughout the history of hosiery advertising, she sees the \u201ceroticisation of white women and subjugation of black women\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dc0cc4d9338f5c1dde9ea3e2fbe724d0db8409bc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc0cc4d9338f5c1dde9ea3e2fbe724d0db8409bc/0_187_1600_960/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Unnerving sensuality \u2026 detail from Morph 7 by Polly Borland (2018)\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Unnerving sensuality \u2026 detail from Morph 7 by Polly Borland (2018).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 Courtesy of the artist and Murray White Room, Melbourne</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Gbewonyo has been working with hosiery since 2016. \u201cI was both interested in it as a material in its malleability and how I could manipulate it in so many interesting ways,\u201d she says. \u201cI cut tights up, stitch them into yarn and create hand-knitted and woven works. I also stitch the legs together to make ruffled fabric that is stretched over canvas. I burn into them, embroider by hand on them and trap them in tissue paper. There\u2019s practically no limit to how they can be used.\u201d</p> <p>In Gossamer, Gbewonyo will show alongside Senga Nengudi, her hero. Nengudi started making sculpture with nylon tights in the mid-1970s, works she referred to as \u201cabstracted reflections of used bodies\u201d.</p> <p>Gbewonyo says: \u201cWhat I love most about Nengudi\u2019s work is how she upsets the boundaries of traditional museum culture by inviting the public to cross those barriers, to touch and feel and truly connect with her work. For me, her work is about celebrating the female form. Hosiery [\u2026] changes shape just as the female form changes shape through different seasons of our life.\u201d</p> <p>Bedeaux agrees: \u201cTights are highly transformative, loaded with all sorts of socio-political connotations. The show is complex, it\u2019s not a show about tights per se: it\u2019s about the possibilities that can come from using a particular object outside of its utilitarian function. This show explores the alchemy of hosiery.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p>Gossamer is at Carl Freedman Gallery, Margate, 28 September to 15 December.</p></li> </ul>",

Bourgeois used tights to form mutant bodies: stuffed as sausage-like limbs, stretched over metal frameworks to resemble female torsos, or strange, expressive, semi-human creatures. In her ongoing Bunny series, Lucas built on Bourgeois\u2019s mutant female stocking sculptures, using three pairs of stuffed tights stretched over a chair to suggest the body of a drunk (literally legless) woman whose supposedly sexy attire \u2013 stockings and bunny ears \u2013 look tawdry in the morning-after light of a gallery. Lucas\u2019s Bunnys are female bodies reduced to a few sexual signifiers: all stockings and stilettos. In her NUDS sculptures, stuffed tights stand in for human limbs of unspecified gender, twisting like fleshy serpents in a strangling, sensual embrace. As the title NUDS suggests, much of the sculptural impact of tights comes from their resemblance to human skin, and the body-like forms they offer. That of course depends on whose skin and whose body: until shockingly recently, the term \u201cnude\u201d in fashion indicated only a beige-pink colour. As brands making nude tights for women of colour (Sheer Chemistry, Bianca Miller, Nubian Skin) appeared on the British market, Enam Gbewonyo started \u201cto chart the history of hosiery and its relationship with black women. I thought about how this item of clothing had till then marginalised black women and how we are often made to feel invisible in the fashion and beauty markets.\u201d Her exploration led back to the days of slavery and empire, to the tights worn by black nurses on the NHS, and the pink tights and shoes that black dancers were forced to wear as a ballet \u201cnorm\u201d. Throughout the history of hosiery advertising, she sees the \u201ceroticisation of white women and subjugation of black women\u201d. Gbewonyo has been working with hosiery since 2016. \u201cI was both interested in it as a material in its malleability and how I could manipulate it in so many interesting ways,\u201d she says. \u201cI cut tights up, stitch them into yarn and create hand-knitted and woven works. I also stitch the legs together to make ruffled fabric that is stretched over canvas. I burn into them, embroider by hand on them and trap them in tissue paper. There\u2019s practically no limit to how they can be used.\u201d In Gossamer, Gbewonyo will show alongside Senga Nengudi, her hero. Nengudi started making sculpture with nylon tights in the mid-1970s, works she referred to as \u201cabstracted reflections of used bodies\u201d. Gbewonyo says: \u201cWhat I love most about Nengudi\u2019s work is how she upsets the boundaries of traditional museum culture by inviting the public to cross those barriers, to touch and feel and truly connect with her work. For me, her work is about celebrating the female form. Hosiery [\u2026] changes shape just as the female form changes shape through different seasons of our life.\u201d Bedeaux agrees: \u201cTights are highly transformative, loaded with all sorts of socio-political connotations. The show is complex, it\u2019s not a show about tights per se: it\u2019s about the possibilities that can come from using a particular object outside of its utilitarian function. This show explores the alchemy of hosiery.\u201d Gossamer is at Carl Freedman Gallery, Margate, 28 September to 15 December.",

      "body": "<h2>Monday</h2> <p>One of the more remarkable features of the Labour party conference was just how few MPs made the effort to come to Brighton. A couple of outliers parachuted themselves in for the day, but the large majority avoided the conference entirely. Which meant that many of the fringe meetings consisted of the same few shadow cabinet ministers and union leaders making much the same speech over and over again. Regardless of what the topic under discussion was meant to be. It did all get quite dull at times. But it was hard to blame so many MPs for staying away, because for most of the first three days the atmosphere was fairly toxic as delegates appeared more interested in blood feuds than getting ready for an election. Having spent the first two days <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/21/explained-attempt-to-remove-tom-watson-deputy-labour-leader\">unsuccessfully trying to remove the deputy leader, Tom Watson</a> \u2013 one of the few Labour moderates who still bothers to attend conference \u2013 the Corbyn wing of the party then went on to slug it out among themselves. The battleground was between those who believed the whole point of joining Corbyn\u2019s Labour party was that its members now got to decide policy and those who reckoned that the leader and those close to him were entitled to do exactly as they wished. Amid rumours of a stitch-up that involved <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2019/sep/23/labour-delegates-reject-plan-to-commit-to-remain-video\">Corbyn\u2019s team packing the hall and the refusal of the chair to allow a formal card vote</a>, the latter prevailed and Labour\u2019s position on Brexit stayed one of creative ambiguity rather than a clear backing of remain. Lord make me a democrat, but not yet.</p> <h2><strong>Tuesday</strong></h2> <p>Having sat through all three days of the supreme court hearing, I wasn\u2019t entirely surprised that the judges upheld the Scottish verdict and allowed Gina Miller\u2019s appeal in the English courts. The government lawyers had appeared hopelessly unprepared compared to Lord Pannick and their entire case seemed to rest on the argument that the government was entitled to do pretty much what it pleased when it came to suspending parliament. So the judges shouldn\u2019t worry their pretty little heads about anything: Boris Johnson could prorogue for as long as he wanted and for whatever reason and there wasn\u2019t a damn thing anyone could do about it. Lord Keen and the rest of the government team appeared to have missed the bit in Constitutional Law for Dommies that said the executive was subservient to parliament and should not frustrate its will. But I was taken aback that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/sep/24/boris-johnsons-suspension-of-parliament-unlawful-supreme-court-rules-prorogue\">judgment was unanimous and so damning</a>. There was an audible gasp among the dozens of lobby journalists in the press room at the Labour conference when Lady Hale delivered the verdict and then pandemonium as everyone tried to work out what to do next. Within an hour many reporters had already decamped back to Westminster. The Labour party was also completely wrongfooted but quickly realised it was a win-win situation. They could prevent Tom Watson speaking by bringing forward Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s speech into the time slot allocated for the deputy leader, while the government\u2019s defeat would mean the conference, which had up till then been a bit of a car-crash, would quickly get forgotten. I left Brighton a day early, taking a late train back to London. The one member of the Guardian team who stayed on at the charming B&amp;B we were in told me the owner looked devastated when no one came down to eat the fabulous breakfast he had prepared. I\u2019m sorry Steve. I had a lovely stay, my room was great and you couldn\u2019t have been more welcoming. I hope you\u2019ll have us back another time.</p> <h2><strong>Wednesday</strong></h2> <p>One of the more unusual takes on the supreme court judgment was Michael Gove insisting that Boris Johnson was a <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/boris-johnson-is-the-pep-guardiola-of-politics-says-gove-5wjg88zf8\">winner like Pep Guardiola</a>, the Manchester City manager. If losing six consecutive votes in the Commons, being found to have unlawfully prorogued parliament, \u2019losing your majority in parliament, being accused of misconduct in public office through the award of a grant to a friend whose <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/25/unfit-for-office-mps-challenge-boris-johnson-public-money-jennifer-arcuri\">UK phone number</a> redirects you to a Florida mailbox \u2013 not to mention countless other minor acts of self-harm \u2013 makes you a winner, I\u2019d hate to think what Gove reckons would make up a losing streak. I\u2019m fairly certain Guardiola would have been fired by City if he had managed all that in under three months. Hell, even Spurs would have second thoughts about that kind of record and we\u2019ve just been knocked out of the Carabao Cup by league two Colchester. In words I thought I\u2019d never write, Johnson is even making David Cameron look a bit of a winner. Not for anything he did in government obviously, but for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/24/david-cameron-memoir-margaret-atwood-dystopia-for-the-record\">success of his memoirs</a> which have gone straight into the Sunday Times and Amazon top 10 bestseller lists in the first week. I had confidently predicted that Cameron\u2019s memoir would quickly end up in remainder shops, with everyone having had more than enough of him through the extended serialisations in the papers and media exposure elsewhere, but it turns out that there are 20,000 people and counting who are desperate to learn more. If my second book of political sketches \u2013 with new bits! \u2013 Decline and Fail (out late October) sells that many in its first week, I will be delirious. Cameron has already earned back \u00a340K of his advance. Just another \u00a3760K to go.</p> <h2><strong>Thursday</strong></h2> <p>Doctors have long been aware of the placebo effect. But a new study conducted by scientists in Germany on students suffering from exam anxiety takes it to a whole new level. Up till now it has always been assumed that the placebo effect relies on patients believing the medicines they are taking have active ingredients in them. But the German researchers divided their study into two groups, one of which was given nothing at all and the other told that the medicine they were being asked to take twice daily was an Open Label Placebo with nothing in it that could treat anxiety. Amazingly, over the 14-day trial period the OLP group saw their anxiety scores fall by four points and their self-management skills increase by 16-points. The scores for the group that was given nothing remained more or less the same throughout the two weeks. I\u2019ve sometimes wondered just how effective the medications I take to help control my depression and anxiety are and whether they work because I believe they work, but have long since concluded that I don\u2019t really care one way or the other. My mental health feels far too precious and fragile for me to turn myself into a one-man drug trial by experimenting with either coming off or trying alternatives. However low I may be feeling, I\u2019m always only too aware there\u2019s no situation that can\u2019t get worse. It\u2019s the Spurs fan in me.</p> <h2><strong>Friday</strong></h2> <p>Another manic week \u2013 almost every week appears to be unprecedented these days \u2013 in politics ended with some of the most unpleasant scenes in Westminster I have ever witnessed. Boris Johnson appears to be physically and emotionally incapable of apologising for anything he has done. Rather \u2013 in classic Trump playbook style \u2013 he doubles down at every turn by making out that he is the real victim and that he only behaves the way he does because everyone else drives him to it. A man with no sense of personal responsibility. He has left many MPs feeling bruised, angry and depressed by insisting his language of surrender, traitors and betrayal has nothing to do with the abuse and death threats that many have received and that they have brought it on themselves by not delivering his as yet unspecified Brexit. One thing that the Incredible Sulk didn\u2019t manage to spoil, though, was my Thursday night. About five months ago, I booked tickets to see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/sep/24/agrippina-review-didonato-royal-opera-house-london\">Agrippina</a> \u2013 a tragicomic opera of ambition, power and lust set in ancient Rome that now looks quite normal compared to the current incumbent of No 10 \u2013 and had feared there might be a critical debate or vote that prevented me from going. For once, though, Johnson didn\u2019t let me down and the opera didn\u2019t disappoint. Three hours in which my soul was temporarily restored. The singing, staging, acting and music were all sensational but Joyce DiDonato in the title role was in a league of her own. She is one of the greatest performers of her generation and was worth every penny and more of the arm and a leg the tickets cost me. It\u2019s odd to be a fan boy at the age of 62, but I\u2019ve seen her many times now and have always come aware that I have been in the presence of a rare talent. An artist generous enough to reach out and touch you with her genius. With one held note and a raised eyebrow she can both break your heart and freeze it. Beg, borrow or steal to get a ticket. You won\u2019t regret it.</p> <p><strong>Digested week: 11-0</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"679c799f869c6d126515ad3b692f6047fe360871\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/679c799f869c6d126515ad3b692f6047fe360871/0_406_4719_2831/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson and Donald Trump at the UN headquarters in New York\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trump to Boris: \u2018Supreme court\u2019s nothing.

Yes, that\u2019s right \u2013 Perry is showing satires on the wealthy at a commercial show in the heart of Mayfair, its streets fragrant with expensive perfume and even more expensive cigar smoke, specifically to sell to the very elite he mocks.</p> <p>The joke really is as trite and cynical as that. In an age when democracy itself is being chewed to pieces by ever more absurdly extreme postures, Perry may be the artist we deserve. His woodblock print Sponsored By You is a supposedly biting take on America and the 1%. It\u2019s a big brightly coloured picture of monstrous, skeletal rich people driving a green sports car across an arid wasteland.

Gasp! The Moorish-style vessel is plastered with images of Tories including Jacob Rees-Mogg, Michael Gove and David Cameron. You can see what you want to see in it. If you want to claim Perry for the left, it\u2019s a deadpan satire in the style of Andy Warhol\u2019s anti-Nixon poster that simply showed Nixon\u2019s face in green. But if you\u2019re a Tory who happens have your credit card with you, it can be a Tory vase.</p> <p>It\u2019s the same with all the lame quotations of received ideas that Perry tries to pass off as Wildean wit. A map of London is covered with blindingly obvious references to elites and the property market.

I just struck it, seen it hit the roof of the net and then my body just took over. I sprinted to the Dale fans, hit top speed then decided to knee slide. That\u2019s a special, special moment for me and everyone.&nbsp;Most of my best mates are United fans.\", 2:B - Russia scored first but lost to Japan; South Africa scored first but lost to New Zealand; Argentina scored first but lost to France; Fiji scored first but lost to Australia; and Namibia scored first but lost to Italy., 3:C - When Trippier gestured to a ball boy for a drink, the supporter threw his bottle to Trippier, who had a swig and then launched it back into the stands, much to the delight of the nearby fans., 4:A - Enough to buy a full Barcelona kit in the club shop \u2013&nbsp;just about., 5:C - Yep. He put up a picture of his unclothed backside outside the White House and tagged the president \u2013&nbsp;while in the US on army duty., 6:B - He continued: \u201cIt\u2019s my face. I bite my teeth in a certain way. I look at babies with exactly the same face \u2013 like \u2018you\u2019re so cute\u2019 \u2013 and very often the babies start howling.\u201d, 7:B - Ray Crawford, who scored two goals in Colchester\u2019s 3-2 win, later recalled: \u201cLeeds loved open spaces but we weren\u2019t going to play to their strengths. Our manager, Dick Graham, made sure the pitch was narrow and he even had temporary seats and benches put in by the touchlines to hem Leeds in further. We were a team of veterans and the press called us 'Dad\u2019s Army' so it suited us that the pitch was small because we couldn\u2019t run around like them. Dick planned it that way.\u201d, 8:B - Although they did win the Audi Cup in July., 9:B - A cannon usually goes off when the team scores, but apparently someone who used to attend the school turned up to the game with his own, non-regulation cannon. The referee\u2019s injuries are not life threatening., 10:B - Despite their victories against Spain in 1999 and Georgia in 2003, Uruguay have never made it out of their group at a World Cup. This could be their year., 11:C - The government\u2019s Intellectual Property Office ruled that the word could not be trademarked due to the \u201cgeographical significance\u201d of the city.</p>\n    <h3 class=\"quiz__scores-title\">Scores</h3>\n    <ol class=\"quiz__scores\" data-result-groups-length=\"13\">\n     <li class=\"quiz__score score\" data-title=\"\" data-share=\"\" data-min-score=\"12\"><p class=\"score__min-score\">12 and above.</p><p class=\"score__title\"></p></li>\n     <li class=\"quiz__score score\" data-title=\"That's a decent score.

As the Brave Blossoms prepare to take on Ireland at the Pacific coast venue on Saturday, the home side and their supporters may not like what the <em>matcha</em> leaves are telling them.</p> \n<p>Jamie Joseph\u2019s side will have needed every day of their generous seven-day turnaround to prepare for a match that will require a repeat of their 2015 heroics against the Springboks if they are to delay Ireland\u2019s unstoppable rise to the top of pool A.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/27/rugby-world-cup-australia-wales-teams\">Michael Cheika hits out at World Rugby over Hodge ban as Wallabies ring changes for Wales</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The New Zealander appears to be among those who view a meeting with the Irish as an opportunity for rest and experimentation before Japan\u2019s decisive remaining pool fixtures against Scotland and Samoa. The captain, Michael Leitch, will begin the match on the bench, while the No 8 Amanaki Mafi is back to full fitness, with the prop Jiwon Koo, lock Luke Thompson \u2013 at 38 the oldest player in the tournament \u2013 and full-back Ryohei Yamanaka promoted from the reserves.</p> \n<p>William Tupou has been switched to wing for the first time in his Test career. Pieter Labuschagne, the South Africa-born flanker, will captain Japan in Leitch\u2019s absence. \u201cMichael\u2019s obviously our captain but if we\u2019re going to be successful in achieving our goals, we\u2019re going to have to have impact and experience off the bench. All the best teams in the world have a great bench,\u201d Joseph said.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf we\u2019re going to be in a position to win the match, it\u2019s going to come down to the last five or 10 minutes and we\u2019ll need clear leadership. As a coach, I get to have both things that we need, we have in-form players who are playing very well and we have experience coming on.\u201d</p> \n<p>Ireland have fond memories of Shizuoka, where the stands will be a sea of red and white speckled with Irish green. When the teams last met there two years ago, the Irish ran out 50-22 winners \u2013 a result that roughly reflects their average against Japan over the past 28 years.</p> \n<p>Japan\u2019s players can do little other than talk up their chances, knowing they took a bonus point on the opening night against Russia in a game they could not have afforded to lose. \u201cThe whole public is favouring the Ireland side, they are expected to win,\u201d the scrum-half Yutaka Nagare said after Joseph revealed the changes \u2013 a match organisers said is likely to be confirmed as the most-viewed live event in Japan this year.</p> \n<p>\u201cBut we are pretty confident and we truly believe we can prove them wrong.

      "bodyText": "Shizuoka is best known as Japan\u2019s biggest producer of green tea. As the Brave Blossoms prepare to take on Ireland at the Pacific coast venue on Saturday, the home side and their supporters may not like what the matcha leaves are telling them. Jamie Joseph\u2019s side will have needed every day of their generous seven-day turnaround to prepare for a match that will require a repeat of their 2015 heroics against the Springboks if they are to delay Ireland\u2019s unstoppable rise to the top of pool A. The New Zealander appears to be among those who view a meeting with the Irish as an opportunity for rest and experimentation before Japan\u2019s decisive remaining pool fixtures against Scotland and Samoa. The captain, Michael Leitch, will begin the match on the bench, while the No 8 Amanaki Mafi is back to full fitness, with the prop Jiwon Koo, lock Luke Thompson \u2013 at 38 the oldest player in the tournament \u2013 and full-back Ryohei Yamanaka promoted from the reserves. William Tupou has been switched to wing for the first time in his Test career. Pieter Labuschagne, the South Africa-born flanker, will captain Japan in Leitch\u2019s absence. \u201cMichael\u2019s obviously our captain but if we\u2019re going to be successful in achieving our goals, we\u2019re going to have to have impact and experience off the bench. All the best teams in the world have a great bench,\u201d Joseph said. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to be in a position to win the match, it\u2019s going to come down to the last five or 10 minutes and we\u2019ll need clear leadership. As a coach, I get to have both things that we need, we have in-form players who are playing very well and we have experience coming on.\u201d Ireland have fond memories of Shizuoka, where the stands will be a sea of red and white speckled with Irish green. When the teams last met there two years ago, the Irish ran out 50-22 winners \u2013 a result that roughly reflects their average against Japan over the past 28 years. Japan\u2019s players can do little other than talk up their chances, knowing they took a bonus point on the opening night against Russia in a game they could not have afforded to lose. \u201cThe whole public is favouring the Ireland side, they are expected to win,\u201d the scrum-half Yutaka Nagare said after Joseph revealed the changes \u2013 a match organisers said is likely to be confirmed as the most-viewed live event in Japan this year. \u201cBut we are pretty confident and we truly believe we can prove them wrong. It\u2019s about mentally believing that, getting the detail right, and having the confidence in our training and what we\u2019ve accumulated through the tournament. We are confident we can beat anyone. Whether Ireland are the best team in the world, we\u2019ve prepared well, so we\u2019re confident.\u201d After a week that decided which two teams will compete in baseball\u2019s Japan Series next month, most of the country\u2019s supootsu shimbun \u2013 sports newspapers \u2013 relegated the buildup to the Ireland match to the inside pages on Friday. Sports Nippon did, though, devote a double-page spread to Joseph\u2019s team selection, predicting Saturday\u2019s game would be the \u201cbattle of the high punt\u201d and claiming that Japan would be able to exploit Ireland\u2019s \u201cweak points.\u201d A subhead implored the players to summon the spirit of Brighton 2015 and carry off what would be the upset of the tournament so far. Similar sentiments informed front-page coverage in Nikkan Sports, which called on Joseph to \u201clead Japan to a miracle.\u201d Media optimism has spread to sections of the team, with the wing Lomano Lemeki, who will join Leitch on the bench, articulating every Japanese fan\u2019s fantasy with the bold prediction that they would prevail 33-26. The reality, as Joseph put it, is that Japan will have to \u201cplay the game of their lives\u201d. That said, public expectation is weighing less on his players after the victory over Russia and an acceptance that Ireland, the world\u2019s top-ranked side until this week, could bring them crashing down to earth, if only briefly. That can only help Japanese players, who admitted they had wobbled under the spotlight against Russia, missing 19 tackles, conceding 18 turnovers and showing a hesitancy beneath the high ball that Ireland can be expected to exploit mercilessly if repeated.

      "bodyText": "Subscribe now to receive the morning briefing by email. Good morning, I\u2019m Tim Walker with today\u2019s essential stories. Trump describes whistleblower\u2019s source as a \u2018spy\u2019 The whistleblower complaint over Donald Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine alleges not only that Trump used a call with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to \u201csolicit interference\u201d in the 2020 election, but that the White House tried to cover up the conversation. The complaint was released in full on Thursday as the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, testified before the House intelligence committee on what he described as a \u201ctotally unprecedented\u201d situation. The New York Times is facing a backlash for publishing details about the whistleblower that could reveal their identity. But Trump told US staff members at the UN that he wanted to know the identity of the whistleblower\u2019s source, describing them as \u201cclose to a spy\u201d and adding: \u201cYou know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart with spies and treason, right? We used to handle it a little differently than we do now.\u201d Trump allies. Democrats have called on the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, to answer questions before Congress on his department\u2019s dealings with Ukraine, while Trump\u2019s lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and the attorney general, William Barr, are also implicated in the scandal. Ukrainian view. In Ukraine, the controversy has led many to question whether the US can be viewed as a trustworthy ally in the country\u2019s attempts to reform and resist Russian pressure, as Andrew Roth reports from Kyiv. Fossil fuel industry more influential under Trump The fossil fuel industry\u2019s bottom line has enjoyed a regulatory windfall under the Trump administration, not least the president\u2019s unilateral withdrawal from the Paris climate change accord. That explains why Trump\u2019s fossil fuel backers are already opening their wallets wide to help his 2020 re-election effort, reports Peter Stone. The coal magnate Robert Murray, for example, raised $2.5m for Trump at a single fundraising dinner in West Virginia in July. EPA threat. The Trump administration has ramped up its feud with California by claiming the state\u2019s homeless crisis is causing increased water pollution, and threatening action by the EPA. Climate strike. Another wave of mass climate strikes are taking place around the world on Friday, including in Canada, Morocco, India, Italy and New Zealand. EU could drop nuclear deal over Iranian non-compliance The European Union has privately warned Iran that it will be forced to withdraw from the 2015 nuclear deal if Tehran makes good on a threat to take new steps beyond the boundaries of the agreement. Since the US exited the deal and reimposed sanctions on Iran, Tehran has taken three calibrated steps away from the conditions of the deal. Now it is threatening a fourth in November, at which point the agreement\u2019s three EU signatories \u2013 France, Germany and the UK \u2013 say they would have to begin withdrawing, too. Tanker released. Stena Impero, the British-flagged oil tanker seized by Iran in July, is preparing to leave the port of Bandar Abbas, a month after the release by UK authorities of an Iranian tanker in the Mediterranean. Cheat sheet The Trump administration has set the cap for refugees allowed into the US over the next fiscal year at 18,000, the lowest number since the US began its refugee program in 1980. More than 350,000 people are expected to seek asylum in that time. The Church of England\u2019s bishops have co-signed a letter saying the language of the Brexit debate has become unacceptable, as the UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, refused to retract his controversial comments about the murdered MP Jo Cox. Lawmakers in Mexico\u2019s Oaxaca state have voted to decriminalise abortion, a win for reproductive rights advocates in the staunchly Catholic nation. It is the second jurisdiction in Mexico to scrap its abortion prohibitions; Mexico City did so in 2007. Japan Airlines has unveiled a new tool on its seat reservation system allowing prospective passengers to see where infants aged between eight days and two years are seated \u2013 and thus to avoid being stuck next to a crying baby on a longhaul flight. Must-reads Inside the cosy world of \u2018bookstagram\u2019 There is a corner of Instagram where book-lovers share stylised photos of their favourite tomes. The \u201cbookstagram\u201d hashtag has been used more than 35m times. Some bookstagrammers have over 100,000 followers. Yet even such an apparently cosy online community has its controversies, as Shelby Pope discovers. The Palestinian entrepreneur bringing power to Gaza When Majd Mashharawi left Gaza to visit Japan in 2017, she tells Saeed Kamali Dehghan, what caught her eye were the working streetlights. Gaza is plagued by regular power-cuts, so on her return Mashharawi launched SunBox, a company that offers affordable, off-grid solar power kits to families. The blockbuster that wasn\u2019t: a $14m Hollywood scam Adam Joiner pitched his movie Legends to foreign investors as a steampunk Avengers, made up of 19th-century American heroes, which had already attracted distribution deals with Netflix and others. Unfortunately for those investors, the project didn\u2019t really exist, as Jake Flanagin reports from Los Angeles. The explosive return of Chris Morris Chris Morris is the British satirist behind Four Lions, whose early TV projects launched the careers of Steve Coogan, Charlie Brooker and others. His latest film was inspired by the FBI\u2019s attempts to manufacture terrorists. \u201cWe were a bubble species long before the internet,\u201d he tells Catherine Shoard in a rare interview. Opinion Liberal and conservative centrists are eager to oust Trump so they can return to the power they previously took for granted, argues Samuel Moyn. What\u2019s needed is not simply impeachment, but an entirely new politics. Centrists simply want to return to the status quo interrupted by Trump, their reputations laundered by their courageous opposition to his mercurial reign, and their policies restored to credibility. Sport The Cleveland Browns appeared to have built a formidable team over the past year, including their second-year quarterback Baker Mayfield and a roster full of high draft picks. And yet, so far, this season has been a dud, writes Oliver Connolly. Manchester City face Everton at Goodison Park, site of the worst defeat of Pep Guardiola\u2019s managerial career.

But it cannot be the whole story - arch-rival Tui has coped because its finances are healthier.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Weather</b><br>The summer heatwave of 2018 encouraged would-be holidaymakers to stay at home, undermining prices in the \u201clates\u201d market where operators try to clear unsold holidays. There seems to have been a hangover into 2019, with customers calculating that waiting to book is a productive strategy.</p>\n    <p><b>Competition</b><br>A pincer movement of Airbnb and budget holidays has changed consumer behaviour, though Thomas Cook still managed to sell 11m package holidays last year.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Banks and debt</b><br>The tour operator has been attempting to shoulder a&nbsp; huge pile of debt for the past decade \u2013 \u00a31.7bn worth at the last count. Successive managements failed to remove meaningful chunks. The banks argue they have supported an overstretched company for years and the details of why it could not be saved may have to await the report from the Insolvency Service.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Bad management</b><br>Thomas Cook\u2019s borrowings were too high. The moral of the tale is that tour operators should fund themselves conservatively.

These comments were widely acknowledged as racist in a broad spectrum of reputable international news outlets, including the Washington Post, New York Times, CNN, MSNBC, Sky News and the Guardian.</p> <p>On 17 July 2019, Dan Walker, a host on BBC Breakfast, commented that a woman had shared a similar experience of being told to \u201cgo home\u201d and that he found that remark \u201ctelling\u201d. Walker added that the person in question had never been told that by the \u201cman sitting in the Oval Office\u201d.</p> <p>Walker asked his co-host Naga Munchetty how she felt, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-49837511\" title=\"\">inviting personal commentary</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The consequences of this decision are widespread with implications for the entire media landscape in the UK and those who work within it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In response to these remarks, Munchetty shared her own experiences of being told \u201cas a woman of colour, to go back to where I came from\u201d and added, \u201cThat was embedded in racism. Now, I\u2019m not accusing anyone of anything here, but you know what certain phrases mean.\u201d</p> <p>When asked by Walker how she felt about Trump\u2019s remarks, she replied \u201cfurious\u201d. \u201cAbsolutely furious and I can imagine lots of people in this country will be feeling absolutely furious a man in that position thinks it\u2019s OK to skirt the lines by using language like that.\u201d</p> <p>On 25 September, the BBC\u2019s Editorial Complaints Unit (ECU) found <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/sep/25/bbcs-naga-munchetty-reprimanded-over-trump-criticism\" title=\"\">Munchetty had breached the corporation\u2019s guidelines</a> in issuing this remark.</p> <p>In a clarification of its decision-making, in response to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/sep/26/bbc-staff-complain-after-colleague-reprimanded-over-trump-remarks\" title=\"\">widespread public criticism</a> \u2013 including from an unprecedented number of British entertainment and broadcasting figures of colour \u2013 on 26 September it said: \u201c[Munchetty] understandably feels strongly on this issue, and there was nothing wrong with her talking about her own experiences of racism. However our editorial guidelines do not allow for journalists to then give their opinions about the individual making the remarks or their motives for doing so \u2026 and it was for this reason that the complaint was partially upheld. Those judgments are for the audience to make.\u201d</p> <p>We, the undersigned group of people of colour who work in the media and broadcasting in the UK, strongly condemn this finding and assert that it amounts to both a misunderstanding of the BBC\u2019s editorial guidelines, and a form of racially discriminatory treatment towards BAME people who work on programming.</p> <p>The BBC\u2019s editorial guidelines allow for \u201cprofessional judgment, rooted in evidence\u201d, and require \u201ccultural views in other communities\u201d to be taken into account. The ECU \u2013 which we believe does not reflect the diverse cultural views in the BAME communities in the UK \u2013 has failed to acknowledge the following:</p> <ul> <li><p>Racism is not a valid opinion on which an \u201cimpartial\u201d stance can or should be maintained;</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p>For communities and individuals who experience racist abuse \u2013 including Munchetty \u2013 being expected to treat racist ideas as potentially valid has devastating and maybe illegal consequences for our dignity and ability to work in a professional environment, as well as being contrary to race equality and human rights legislation;</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p>To suggest a journalist can \u201ctalk about her own experiences of racism\u201d while withholding a critique on the author of racism (in this case President Trump) has the ludicrous implication that such racism may be legitimate and should be contemplated as such</p></li> </ul> <p>While we stand in support of Munchetty, the consequences of this decision are widespread with implications for the entire media landscape in the UK and those who work within it. The scope of its effect is already evidenced in the unprecedented number of BAME media figures who have openly and publicly voiced their condemnation on social media.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/sep/26/bbc-staff-complain-after-colleague-reprimanded-over-trump-remarks\">BBC staff complain over Munchetty reprimand for Trump remark</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In addition, we note the number of BBC journalists who have contacted us privately to express their concern at the climate of fear at the organisation, their feeling of being censored, and their apprehension at the consequences of their speaking out in support of this statement.</p> <p>We demand that:</p> <p>1. The ECU revisits and takes seriously overturning its decision;</p> <p>2. BBC management issue their support for journalists and acknowledge there can be no expectation of \u201cimpartiality\u201d over expressions and experiences of racism;</p> <p>3.

      "bodyText": "Dear BBC, On 16 July 2019, President Trump tweeted that four congresswomen should \u201cgo back to the totally broken and crime-infested places from which they came\u201d. All four congresswomen are people of colour, all four are US citizens and only congresswoman Ilhan Omar was born overseas. These comments were widely acknowledged as racist in a broad spectrum of reputable international news outlets, including the Washington Post, New York Times, CNN, MSNBC, Sky News and the Guardian. On 17 July 2019, Dan Walker, a host on BBC Breakfast, commented that a woman had shared a similar experience of being told to \u201cgo home\u201d and that he found that remark \u201ctelling\u201d. Walker added that the person in question had never been told that by the \u201cman sitting in the Oval Office\u201d. Walker asked his co-host Naga Munchetty how she felt, inviting personal commentary. In response to these remarks, Munchetty shared her own experiences of being told \u201cas a woman of colour, to go back to where I came from\u201d and added, \u201cThat was embedded in racism. Now, I\u2019m not accusing anyone of anything here, but you know what certain phrases mean.\u201d When asked by Walker how she felt about Trump\u2019s remarks, she replied \u201cfurious\u201d. \u201cAbsolutely furious and I can imagine lots of people in this country will be feeling absolutely furious a man in that position thinks it\u2019s OK to skirt the lines by using language like that.\u201d On 25 September, the BBC\u2019s Editorial Complaints Unit (ECU) found Munchetty had breached the corporation\u2019s guidelines in issuing this remark. In a clarification of its decision-making, in response to widespread public criticism \u2013 including from an unprecedented number of British entertainment and broadcasting figures of colour \u2013 on 26 September it said: \u201c[Munchetty] understandably feels strongly on this issue, and there was nothing wrong with her talking about her own experiences of racism. However our editorial guidelines do not allow for journalists to then give their opinions about the individual making the remarks or their motives for doing so \u2026 and it was for this reason that the complaint was partially upheld. Those judgments are for the audience to make.\u201d We, the undersigned group of people of colour who work in the media and broadcasting in the UK, strongly condemn this finding and assert that it amounts to both a misunderstanding of the BBC\u2019s editorial guidelines, and a form of racially discriminatory treatment towards BAME people who work on programming. The BBC\u2019s editorial guidelines allow for \u201cprofessional judgment, rooted in evidence\u201d, and require \u201ccultural views in other communities\u201d to be taken into account. The ECU \u2013 which we believe does not reflect the diverse cultural views in the BAME communities in the UK \u2013 has failed to acknowledge the following: Racism is not a valid opinion on which an \u201cimpartial\u201d stance can or should be maintained; For communities and individuals who experience racist abuse \u2013 including Munchetty \u2013 being expected to treat racist ideas as potentially valid has devastating and maybe illegal consequences for our dignity and ability to work in a professional environment, as well as being contrary to race equality and human rights legislation; To suggest a journalist can \u201ctalk about her own experiences of racism\u201d while withholding a critique on the author of racism (in this case President Trump) has the ludicrous implication that such racism may be legitimate and should be contemplated as such While we stand in support of Munchetty, the consequences of this decision are widespread with implications for the entire media landscape in the UK and those who work within it. The scope of its effect is already evidenced in the unprecedented number of BAME media figures who have openly and publicly voiced their condemnation on social media. In addition, we note the number of BBC journalists who have contacted us privately to express their concern at the climate of fear at the organisation, their feeling of being censored, and their apprehension at the consequences of their speaking out in support of this statement. We demand that: 1. The ECU revisits and takes seriously overturning its decision; 2. BBC management issue their support for journalists and acknowledge there can be no expectation of \u201cimpartiality\u201d over expressions and experiences of racism; 3. The bodies that oversee complaints about broadcasting, including the ECU and Ofcom, address their own levels of diversity and increase transparency as to how they reach their decisions, and how that process takes place in a manner reflective of the diversity of the population We believe that, in addition to being deeply flawed, illegal and contrary to the spirit and purpose of public broadcasting, the BBC\u2019s current position will have a profound effect on future diversity within the BBC. To suggest that future BAME broadcasters will be hired at the corporation on the premise that they remain \u201cimpartial\u201d about how they feel about their experiences of racism is ludicrous.

      "body": "<p>On the morning of 8 May, 2003, I stepped off a train in the German town of Germersheim, where I was studying to be a translator. I got on my bike and was about to cycle away when I noticed another woman trying to board the train. Still on my bike, I stuck my hand in the closing door to keep it open for her. Instead, the door shut and trapped my arm.</p> <p>We both cried for help, but the people on the train couldn\u2019t hear us, because the windows were sealed. The driver\u2019s cabin didn\u2019t have rear-view mirrors. My wrist was clamped by the door, with my entire hand inside the train. To my horror, it started moving.</p> <p>It was a sunny day. I was wearing a T-shirt and a jumper knotted around my waist, long trousers and sunglasses, and a backpack. At first, the train pulled me along on my bike. I kicked it away and was dragged along the platform. I managed to grip my trapped left arm with my right hand and pull up my legs. The train accelerated. It was the most frightening moment of my life. I forced myself to focus on trying to survive.</p> <p>I was 35 years old. I had previously trained as a contemporary dancer, and still took tango classes. I also enjoyed indoor climbing. As a result, I was fit and nimble. I knew it was eight minutes till the next stop, in the town of Speyer. I needed to cling to the train for that long.</p> <p>Instinctively, I reached for holds. To my right was a gap between two carriages. I stretched out my right foot and managed to rest it on some hydraulic tubes there, then placed my left foot next to it. With my right hand, I let go of my trapped arm and tried to pull myself into the gap. All I could hear was the roar of the train and the masts wooshing past me. Any moment, the airstream might pull me out of the gap to be smashed against the next mast.</p> <p>I was familiar with the route and knew there was a curve ahead, but I could not remember if it was to the right or left. A left curve would mean I would be flung off the train by the centrifugal force. A right curve could crush me in the narrowing gap between the carriages.</p> <p>The train hurtled into a right curve at 75mph. The gap narrowed, but I managed to hang on. My whole body was trembling with fear. I had to tense my legs to avoid slipping off. My biggest fear was that my strength wouldn\u2019t last and I would fall to my death.</p> <p>Back in Germersheim, the woman I had been trying to assist was desperately looking for help. Eventually, she found a station attendant, who called the control board. They alerted the driver, who stopped the train. The process took seven minutes.</p> <p>I felt the train slow down and stop, then heard the \u201cshh\u201d sound signalling the release of the doors. Using my last bit of strength, I reached for the button by the door and pressed it. The door opened and I tumbled on to the gravel tracks. I was still wearing my backpack, my sunglasses, even my jumper around my waist.</p> <p>The train driver thought someone on the inside of the train had trapped their hand. When he saw me, he almost fainted. A passing driver took me to a hospital in Germersheim, where I spent two days recovering. I had cuts and bruises all over, but otherwise was physically fine.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/sep/13/experience-i-nearly-died-of-measles\">Experience: I nearly died of measles</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The mental fallout was terrible, though.

      "bodyText": "\u201cFootballer? Do you mean that game you play with your hands ... volleyball? Tell me the offside rule if you are a footballer.\u201d That was how one taxi driver reacted when Didem Karagen\u00e7 explained to him that she is a footballer. \u201cThis is what I have to put up with,\u201d she says with a laugh, thinking back to that moment. Karagen\u00e7 is the captain of Turkey\u2019s national team as well as of Be\u015fikta\u015f, playing a key role in the Black Eagles lifting last season\u2019s Super Lig title. She also wants to be a role model and inspiration for the next generation of female footballers. \u201cYoung girls had nobody to look up to in the past,\u201d says Karagen\u00e7. \u201cI watched men\u2019s football and was a huge fan of Roberto Carlos. But there were no female players to emulate \u2013 I had to become my own role model.\u201d Be\u015fikta\u015f are one of the biggest clubs in Turkey, with millions of fans, a huge number of trophies and some of the highest-paid footballers in the country. But their women\u2019s team was only founded in 2014, 103 years after the men\u2019s. Karagen\u00e7, a 25-year-old left-back, joined Be\u015fikta\u015f a year after they were formed and played a part in them cruising through the 2015-16 campaign as undefeated champions of the Second Football League and thus ensuring promotion to the top-tier. After finishing the 2017-18 season as runners-up, they went onto lift the title last season and book a place in the Champions League. It was a heady time yet for Karagen\u00e7 and her team-mates, as one of struggle given their lack of financial reward and support. \u201cTo be honest, I thought about quitting football,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was heartbreaking but I couldn\u2019t see a way I could continue supporting myself.\u201d \u201cIt made me feel worthless. I have loved this game since I was a little girl. I am also a teacher and an analyst for the TFF [Turkish Football Federation] \u2013 I have to do two jobs to survive, and after work I train in the evening. Thankfully the manager, Mutlucan Zavot\u00e7u, understands the situation I and a lot of my teammates are in.

The fans are everything.\u201d Football being more than a sport may sound like a cliche but in Turkey it\u2019s very much true \u2013 female players who represent the national team are also given the chance to gain a university education while those who play for clubs that have a Turkish Football Federation license can go onto gain the credits required for a scholarship from local businesses. \u201cI was lucky; my father is a teacher and always supported me,\u201d says Karagen\u00e7. \u201cIn fact, he helped me find my first team and encouraged me to play.

      "body": "<p>Some of Britain\u2019s biggest firms have caved in to pressure from investors to curb big pension payments to top executives and close the gap with the rest of the workforce, research has found.</p> <p>Four out of 10 FTSE 100 companies have cut pension contributions to new or existing directors this year, according to a report by global advisory firm Willis Towers Watson.</p> <p>Big annual pension contributions to executives <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/mar/30/executive-pay-pensions-rsa-hsbc-tui-lloyds\">have drawn the ire of shareholders this year</a>, aside from multimillion-pound bonuses. For example, Stephen Hester, the chief executive of RSA, the insurer behind the More Than brand, received \u00a3302,000 to help him \u201csave for retirement\u201d. This amounted to 30% of his basic salary.</p> <p>The Willis Towers Watson research, which tracks changes to executive remuneration during the annual general meeting season, showed the median pension contribution for chief executives fell to 20% of salary this year, from 25% last year.</p> <p>Three in 10 companies have reduced pension payments for new executive recruits, more than halving contributions to 12% of salary, from 25%. A dozen companies, including HSBC and Lloyds Banking Group, reduced pension payouts for executives, up from four in 2018.</p> <p>Shareholder pressure forced HSBC to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2019/mar/20/the-welcome-sight-of-banks-rowing-back-on-executive-pensions\">reduce pension contributions for its executives from 30% to 10% of salary</a> in February, shaving nearly \u00a3250,000 off John Flint\u2019s pay package, before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/aug/05/hsbc-boss-john-flint-resigns-by-mutual-agreement\">the former chief executive was pushed out in August</a>. Other staff receive between 9% and 16%, according to the bank.</p> <p>The Lloyds boss, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2019/mar/20/the-welcome-sight-of-banks-rowing-back-on-executive-pensions\">Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, had his pension payment reduced</a> to \u00a3419,000, or 33% of salary, this year, from \u00a3573,000, or 46% of salary. This compares with about 8% to 13% for the rest of the workforce.</p> <p>For employees at FTSE 100 firms, employer core contributions rose to 6.5% this year from 5.5% in 2018, according to separate Willis Towers Watson figures.

      "bodyText": "Some of Britain\u2019s biggest firms have caved in to pressure from investors to curb big pension payments to top executives and close the gap with the rest of the workforce, research has found. Four out of 10 FTSE 100 companies have cut pension contributions to new or existing directors this year, according to a report by global advisory firm Willis Towers Watson. Big annual pension contributions to executives have drawn the ire of shareholders this year, aside from multimillion-pound bonuses. For example, Stephen Hester, the chief executive of RSA, the insurer behind the More Than brand, received \u00a3302,000 to help him \u201csave for retirement\u201d. This amounted to 30% of his basic salary. The Willis Towers Watson research, which tracks changes to executive remuneration during the annual general meeting season, showed the median pension contribution for chief executives fell to 20% of salary this year, from 25% last year. Three in 10 companies have reduced pension payments for new executive recruits, more than halving contributions to 12% of salary, from 25%. A dozen companies, including HSBC and Lloyds Banking Group, reduced pension payouts for executives, up from four in 2018. Shareholder pressure forced HSBC to reduce pension contributions for its executives from 30% to 10% of salary in February, shaving nearly \u00a3250,000 off John Flint\u2019s pay package, before the former chief executive was pushed out in August. Other staff receive between 9% and 16%, according to the bank. The Lloyds boss, Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, had his pension payment reduced to \u00a3419,000, or 33% of salary, this year, from \u00a3573,000, or 46% of salary. This compares with about 8% to 13% for the rest of the workforce. For employees at FTSE 100 firms, employer core contributions rose to 6.5% this year from 5.5% in 2018, according to separate Willis Towers Watson figures. They refer to defined contribution schemes, where employer and employee contributions are invested and the proceeds are used to buy a pension at retirement. In the wider economy, workers in final salary schemes, which have largely been phased out and where pensions are linked to the last salary earned, can receive contributions as high as 25% to 30%. But many workers are getting far less, with the standard employer contribution under auto enrolment increasing to 3% in April. Jessica Norton of Willis Towers Watson said: \u201cIncreasing scrutiny by the governance community on pensions marks the latest stage in the ongoing debate surrounding the appropriateness of executive pay that has been simmering since the financial crisis. \u201cIn response to pressure from shareholders and regulators that has been building for some time, a significant number of companies have cut payments to executive pension pots as part of a wider strategy that is aimed at moving towards better alignment with the workforce.\u201d In other findings, FTSE 100 chief executives received a median salary increase of 2% to \u00a3876,000 this year, with one in four getting no pay rise. They also typically enjoy a car allowance worth \u00a320,000. The median annual bonus payout fell to 70% from 76% of the maximum possible payout, the research found. Company bosses received a median total pay package of \u00a33.59m this year \u2013 down to the levels of 2015 and 2016.",

      "body": "<p>\u201cHitler was a socialist,\u201d has become a mantra for the \u201calt-right\u201d in the US as it seeks to discredit Democratic politicians such as Bernie Sanders and Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez. Dinesh D\u2019Souza\u2019s book <em>The Big Lie: Exposing the Nazi Roots of the American Left</em> expounded this claim at length in 2017, comparing points of the Nazi party\u2019s 1920 programme with policies put forward by modern Democrats. So, anyone who claims to be a socialist is really a Nazi who wants to set the country on the road to totalitarianism, war and genocide. Obamacare is only the start; enslavement and death will be the end. It\u2019s a claim that has spread through the Republican party and has been echoed by Donald Trump Jr.</p> <p>Now it has found its way across the Atlantic in the form of Brendan Simms\u2019s new book, the central argument of which is that \u201cHitler\u2019s principal preoccupation throughout his career was Anglo-America and global capitalism, rather than the Soviet Union and Bolshevism\u201d. Everything in his life can be traced back to this obsession. \u201cHitler wanted to establish what he considered racial unity in Germany by overcoming the capitalist order and working for the construction of a new classless society.\u201d Throughout his career, \u201cHitler\u2019s rhetoric\u201d was \u201cfar more anti-capitalist than anti-communist\u201d. Simms asserts \u201cthe centrality of the British Empire and the United States in the gestation of <em>Mein Kampf</em>\u201d, just as he claims of Hitler\u2019s long unpublished <em>Second Book</em> that \u201cthe main focus of the text was the overwhelming power of Anglo-America, and especially of the United States\u201d.</p> <p>Hitler has been the subject of a string of major biographies, from those by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/feb/03/guardianobituaries.obituaries\" title=\"\">Alan Bullock</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/sep/12/germany.world\" title=\"\">Joachim Fest</a> to, most recently, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/oct/07/historybooks.biography\" title=\"\">Ian Kershaw</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/27/hitler-ascent-review-volker-ullrich-outstanding-study\" title=\"\">Volker Ullrich</a>. But they have all, Simms writes, got him wrong: \u201cThe extent to which he was fighting a war against \u2018international high finance\u2019 and \u2018plutocracy\u2019 from start to finish has not been understood at all.\u201d Now he has come along to set us all right.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There are good reasons why the consensus of historical scholarship has rejected any idea that Hitler was a socialist</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There are good reasons, however, why the overwhelming consensus of historical scholarship has rejected any idea that Hitler was a socialist. Simms emphasises the violence of Nazi stormtroopers in the early 1930s against German conservatives rather than socialists and communists, but in fact the latter made up the overwhelming majority of the 200,000 or so opponents of Nazism who were thrown into concentration camps during Hitler\u2019s first year in power. As for <em>Mein Kampf</em>, it was the threat of communism and socialism that dominated the political part of the text, in which Hitler expounded his belief that \u201cthe Bolshevisation of Germany \u2026 means the complete annihilation of the entire Christian-western culture\u201d. In similar fashion the main focus of the <em>Second Book</em> was not the US, which is mentioned only on a handful of pages, but the need for \u201cliving-space\u201d in eastern Europe and German claims to Italian South Tyrol.</p> <p>The central planks in the socialist platform have always been the belief that capitalism oppresses the mass of the people and needs to be overthrown, or at least moderated and regulated in their interest. Simms claims that \u201cwhat Hitler did very effectively\u201d was \u201cto nationalise German industrialists by making them instruments of his political will\u201d. But this was not economic or financial control exercised in the interests of the people, nor did Hitler nationalise industry or the banks in any meaningful sense of the word. Rather, he set a political course for rearmament as part of his drive to war that pushed industrialists such as Thyssen and Krupp to devote ever more resources to arms production in the interests of increasing their profits. The result was heightened exploitation of the workers, as the overheating of war production forced them even before 1939 to work longer hours without extra pay. This was not socialism, whatever else it was.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5e82e33df3087a3bce1ead0221e7ae93214d5877\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5e82e33df3087a3bce1ead0221e7ae93214d5877/0_483_5808_3485/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The morning after Kristallnacht in Magdeburg, November 1938.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The morning after Kristallnacht in Magdeburg, November 1938.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wiener Holocaust Library Collections/Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Simms\u2019s reduction of virtually all the major events in the history of the Third Reich to a product of anti-Americanism even extends to episodes such as the nationwide pogrom of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/kristallnacht\" title=\"\">Reichskristallnacht</a> in November 1938, when thousands of Jewish businesses and synagogues were destroyed and 30,000 Jewish men put into concentration camps. Apparently this was caused by \u201cRoosevelt\u2019s hostility to Hitler and his defence of the Jews\u201d. The invasion of the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941 was launched in order \u201cto strike at Britain, and to deter the United States \u2026 Barbarossa was to be a campaign of conquest and annihilation, for reasons more to do with Anglo-America than the Soviet Union itself\u201d. Even the Holocaust, we should not be surprised to learn, was \u201cprimarily driven \u2026 by his fear of Britain and the United States\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/08/nazi-design-exhibition-netherlands-fears-glorification\">Nazi design exhibition in Netherlands raises fears of glorification</a> </p> </aside>  <p>All this is nonsense, and indeed, Simms is forced to contradict himself by the sheer weight of the evidence against his thesis. The invasion of the Soviet Union was, he concedes, \u201cpart of a much broader ideological war against Bolshevism\u201d: \u201ca struggle between two world views\u201d, as Hitler put it. He admits that Hitler \u201cwas not completely opposed to all forms of capitalism\u201d, only \u201cunproductive\u201d ones: in other words Jewish-owned capital, as with, for example, department store chains \u2013 he forced Jewish owners out but did not close them down. Interviewed by the Daily Express correspondent Sefton Delmer in 1931, Hitler said: \u201cMy job is to prevent the millions of German unemployed from coming under communist influence.\u201d He did not even mention America in outlining his foreign policy aims to the journalist.</p> <p>Time and again, Simms uses rhetorical sleight of hand to underscore his claim that the US was the main focus of Hitler\u2019s foreign policy by referring to \u201cAnglo-America\u201d when he is in fact just talking about Britain. He quotes a proclamation from Hitler saying on New Year\u2019s Day 1944 that the war was being fought against the \u201cBolshevik-plutocratic world conspirators and their Jewish wire-pullers\u201d; a few lines later this has become in Simms\u2019s words a struggle against \u201cAnglo-American imperialism\u201d, and all mention of the Bolsheviks has disappeared. Yet Hitler was quite clear about the issue: \u201cEverything I do is directed against Russia,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Simms claims that Hitler was engaged in \u201ca war of annihilation against Anglo-Saxons, the Jews and their Bolshevik puppets\u201d. But there was no war of annihilation against \u201cAnglo-Saxons\u201d; indeed, it was striking that when in 1944-45 the camps were emptied as the Red Army advanced, British, American and French prisoners were relatively well treated, while the evacuation of Slavs and the few remaining Jews turned into death marches in which tens of thousands were murdered.</p> <p>The military conduct of the war in Simms\u2019s view was also directed against the US: even \u201cthe drive on Stalingrad, like the entire war, was primarily driven by the contest against Anglo-America\u201d. But contrary to Simms\u2019s denial of the fact, Stalingrad held a special significance for Hitler because of its name. Pursuing his claim to the centrality of \u201cAnglo-America\u201d in the Nazi war effort, Simms declares that the capitulation of axis forces in Tunisia in May 1943 \u201cwas a much greater disaster than Stalingrad, with well in excess of 130,000 Wehrmacht personnel taken prisoner, many more than had entered captivity\u201d at Stalingrad. But these are phoney statistics. In fact, about the same number of German <em>and allied</em> troops were captured on both occasions (around 235,000). The real difference was in the numbers killed \u2013 some 50,000 or so in Tunisia, anything up to 750,000, more than 10 times as many, at Stalingrad. It was north Africa that was the sideshow, not Stalingrad, the effects of which on the strategy and morale of the Germans were shattering.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a82043b83041746919f6831e22510a7721d8eb43\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a82043b83041746919f6831e22510a7721d8eb43/0_73_2993_1797/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Red Army troops during the battle of Stalingrad in 1942.

He claims, for example, that Hitler\u2019s willpower kept the Germans going to the bitter end of the war, but a mass of recent research shows there were many other reasons, from fear of the Gestapo and terror of the Red Army to strong allegiance to German national identity.

      "bodyText": "\u201cHitler was a socialist,\u201d has become a mantra for the \u201calt-right\u201d in the US as it seeks to discredit Democratic politicians such as Bernie Sanders and Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez. Dinesh D\u2019Souza\u2019s book The Big Lie: Exposing the Nazi Roots of the American Left expounded this claim at length in 2017, comparing points of the Nazi party\u2019s 1920 programme with policies put forward by modern Democrats. So, anyone who claims to be a socialist is really a Nazi who wants to set the country on the road to totalitarianism, war and genocide. Obamacare is only the start; enslavement and death will be the end. It\u2019s a claim that has spread through the Republican party and has been echoed by Donald Trump Jr. Now it has found its way across the Atlantic in the form of Brendan Simms\u2019s new book, the central argument of which is that \u201cHitler\u2019s principal preoccupation throughout his career was Anglo-America and global capitalism, rather than the Soviet Union and Bolshevism\u201d. Everything in his life can be traced back to this obsession. \u201cHitler wanted to establish what he considered racial unity in Germany by overcoming the capitalist order and working for the construction of a new classless society.\u201d Throughout his career, \u201cHitler\u2019s rhetoric\u201d was \u201cfar more anti-capitalist than anti-communist\u201d. Simms asserts \u201cthe centrality of the British Empire and the United States in the gestation of Mein Kampf\u201d, just as he claims of Hitler\u2019s long unpublished Second Book that \u201cthe main focus of the text was the overwhelming power of Anglo-America, and especially of the United States\u201d. Hitler has been the subject of a string of major biographies, from those by Alan Bullock and Joachim Fest to, most recently, Ian Kershaw and Volker Ullrich. But they have all, Simms writes, got him wrong: \u201cThe extent to which he was fighting a war against \u2018international high finance\u2019 and \u2018plutocracy\u2019 from start to finish has not been understood at all.\u201d Now he has come along to set us all right. There are good reasons, however, why the overwhelming consensus of historical scholarship has rejected any idea that Hitler was a socialist. Simms emphasises the violence of Nazi stormtroopers in the early 1930s against German conservatives rather than socialists and communists, but in fact the latter made up the overwhelming majority of the 200,000 or so opponents of Nazism who were thrown into concentration camps during Hitler\u2019s first year in power. As for Mein Kampf, it was the threat of communism and socialism that dominated the political part of the text, in which Hitler expounded his belief that \u201cthe Bolshevisation of Germany \u2026 means the complete annihilation of the entire Christian-western culture\u201d. In similar fashion the main focus of the Second Book was not the US, which is mentioned only on a handful of pages, but the need for \u201cliving-space\u201d in eastern Europe and German claims to Italian South Tyrol. The central planks in the socialist platform have always been the belief that capitalism oppresses the mass of the people and needs to be overthrown, or at least moderated and regulated in their interest. Simms claims that \u201cwhat Hitler did very effectively\u201d was \u201cto nationalise German industrialists by making them instruments of his political will\u201d. But this was not economic or financial control exercised in the interests of the people, nor did Hitler nationalise industry or the banks in any meaningful sense of the word. Rather, he set a political course for rearmament as part of his drive to war that pushed industrialists such as Thyssen and Krupp to devote ever more resources to arms production in the interests of increasing their profits. The result was heightened exploitation of the workers, as the overheating of war production forced them even before 1939 to work longer hours without extra pay. This was not socialism, whatever else it was. Simms\u2019s reduction of virtually all the major events in the history of the Third Reich to a product of anti-Americanism even extends to episodes such as the nationwide pogrom of the Reichskristallnacht in November 1938, when thousands of Jewish businesses and synagogues were destroyed and 30,000 Jewish men put into concentration camps. Apparently this was caused by \u201cRoosevelt\u2019s hostility to Hitler and his defence of the Jews\u201d. The invasion of the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941 was launched in order \u201cto strike at Britain, and to deter the United States \u2026 Barbarossa was to be a campaign of conquest and annihilation, for reasons more to do with Anglo-America than the Soviet Union itself\u201d. Even the Holocaust, we should not be surprised to learn, was \u201cprimarily driven \u2026 by his fear of Britain and the United States\u201d. All this is nonsense, and indeed, Simms is forced to contradict himself by the sheer weight of the evidence against his thesis. The invasion of the Soviet Union was, he concedes, \u201cpart of a much broader ideological war against Bolshevism\u201d: \u201ca struggle between two world views\u201d, as Hitler put it. He admits that Hitler \u201cwas not completely opposed to all forms of capitalism\u201d, only \u201cunproductive\u201d ones: in other words Jewish-owned capital, as with, for example, department store chains \u2013 he forced Jewish owners out but did not close them down. Interviewed by the Daily Express correspondent Sefton Delmer in 1931, Hitler said: \u201cMy job is to prevent the millions of German unemployed from coming under communist influence.\u201d He did not even mention America in outlining his foreign policy aims to the journalist. Time and again, Simms uses rhetorical sleight of hand to underscore his claim that the US was the main focus of Hitler\u2019s foreign policy by referring to \u201cAnglo-America\u201d when he is in fact just talking about Britain. He quotes a proclamation from Hitler saying on New Year\u2019s Day 1944 that the war was being fought against the \u201cBolshevik-plutocratic world conspirators and their Jewish wire-pullers\u201d; a few lines later this has become in Simms\u2019s words a struggle against \u201cAnglo-American imperialism\u201d, and all mention of the Bolsheviks has disappeared. Yet Hitler was quite clear about the issue: \u201cEverything I do is directed against Russia,\u201d he said. Simms claims that Hitler was engaged in \u201ca war of annihilation against Anglo-Saxons, the Jews and their Bolshevik puppets\u201d. But there was no war of annihilation against \u201cAnglo-Saxons\u201d; indeed, it was striking that when in 1944-45 the camps were emptied as the Red Army advanced, British, American and French prisoners were relatively well treated, while the evacuation of Slavs and the few remaining Jews turned into death marches in which tens of thousands were murdered. The military conduct of the war in Simms\u2019s view was also directed against the US: even \u201cthe drive on Stalingrad, like the entire war, was primarily driven by the contest against Anglo-America\u201d. But contrary to Simms\u2019s denial of the fact, Stalingrad held a special significance for Hitler because of its name. Pursuing his claim to the centrality of \u201cAnglo-America\u201d in the Nazi war effort, Simms declares that the capitulation of axis forces in Tunisia in May 1943 \u201cwas a much greater disaster than Stalingrad, with well in excess of 130,000 Wehrmacht personnel taken prisoner, many more than had entered captivity\u201d at Stalingrad.

      "bodyText": "Five of the best \u2026 films The Goldfinch (15) (John Crowley, 2019, US) 149 mins Donna Tartt\u2019s celebrated 2013 novel makes it to the big screen, with Ansel Elgort in the lead role of Theo, the kid caught up in an art museum bombing during which his mother is killed, who then purloins the celebrated masterwork of the title. Perhaps unfairly, having posted a big loss on its US release, the film has been pegged as a disaster, but it is likely to get a better reception in the UK. The Last Tree (15) (Shola Amoo, 2019, UK) 99 mins British-Nigerian director Shola Amoo returns with this semi-autobiographical period film with a twist about a young boy torn between three distinct identities: the rural Lincolnshire community where he was fostered; the tough London estate where he grew up after his birth mother reclaimed him; and, finally, the traditional Nigerian family he came from. Ad Astra (12A) (James Gray, 2019, Chi/Bra/US) 123 mins Brad Pitt has attracted plenty of admiring notices for this slow, serious but mighty space film. He plays an astronaut who embarks on a Conradian journey into the far reaches of the solar system, attempting to track down his missing father, who had left planet Earth years before to set up a secret project on Neptune. Best Before Death (12A) (Paul Duane, 2019, US/UK/Ire) 93 mins Irish documentary-maker Paul Duane has an affinity with maverick music-industry types \u2013 witness his 2012 doc Very Extremely Dangerous, about C&amp;W-singing bankrobber Jerry McGill \u2013 and here his subject, or more accurately, collaborator, is Bill Drummond of the KLF. Duane follows Drummond on his world tour, first to Kolkata and then Lexington, giving cakes to strangers, listening to music, and getting shaved. The Third Man (PG) (Carol Reed, 1949 UK) 104 mins This postwar masterwork is a conflation of brilliant talents: a haunting Graham Greene script, beautifully fluid direction by Carol Reed, and knockout performances from Joseph Cotten and Orson Welles. It also transmits a mood of palpable unease as Europe remade itself after the second world war: Welles\u2019s Harry Lime stages his fake death after attracting the attention of the authorities over his black-market activities. AP Five of the best \u2026 rock &amp; pop Alma Despite none of her recent singles building on the success of 2017\u2019s breakthrough banger, the storming electropop of Chasing Highs, Finland\u2019s Alma is scooping up a solid catalogue of co-writes, including three Miley Cyrus songs.

Kitchen\u2019s time and energy have been shifted towards everything in the building, not solely what the Browns will do on first down. The difference is drastic.</p> <p>And yet it\u2019s Mayfield who remains the biggest concern. He sits 31<sup>st</sup> in DVOA among 37 qualified starters. If you rule out the two starters from the Dolphins,<a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/27699720/barnwell-dolphins-really-doing-how-tank-win\"> a team intentionally trying to lose</a>, Mayfield would rank as the fifth-worst quarterback in the league by down-to-down efficiency, behind the likes of Jameis Winston and Andy Dalton.

He has happy feet in the pocket and is anticipating and expecting pressure without an iota of trust in his protection.</p> <p>In fairness to Mayfield, that lack of trust has been earned. Mayfield has been pressured by defenders on around a third of his dropbacks in 2019, the eighth-worst mark in the league. The Browns finished with the 11<sup>th</sup> best pressure rate in the NFL a year ago, three whole percentage points better off per game. Give a quarterback that many more plays unencumbered per season and they will feast.</p> <p>There are other, more nuanced issues. One is the inclusion of Beckham in the offense. Such a star demands defensive attention \u2013 which should liberate others to make plays \u2013 but he also demands touches. The Browns haven\u2019t figured out how to incorporate him properly into their offense yet, and Mayfield has struggled as a result.</p> <p>A quarterback unable to play his natural game helps no one. When quarterbacks start forcing the ball to their top target and predetermine throws prior to the snap, the rest of the offense sags. That is no knock on Beckham. He has played to his typically great levels. But the way he has been used has been ham-fisted and amateur \u2013 a quick screen here, a bubble pass there. When he has broken plays within the structure of the system, Mayfield has looked elsewhere:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/OllieConnolly/status/1176827268171206656\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Mayfield/The Browns O has been odd this year.

      "body": "<p>With Aymeric Laporte having been ruled out for around six months with a nasty knee injury, <strong>Manchester City</strong> might be tempted into a move for another centre-back this January. Despite having missed out on Harry Maguire in the summer, Pep Guardiola\u2019s gaze is still fixed on a burly Leicester defender. And no, we won\u2019t be seeing Wes Morgan\u2019s second coming as an elite title-inspiring force at the back for a different City. <br><br>The player who has got Pep rubbing his palms giddily is <strong>Caglar Soyuncu</strong>, whose outstanding displays for Brendan Rodgers\u2019 side have made Maguire\u2019s \u00a380m departure to Manchester United seem little more than a mild inconvenience. The 23-year-old has proved himself able to work the ball out from the back without gifting the ball to opposition forwards or playing ludicrous square passes to invisible teammates, so he could well be an upgrade on Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi and John Stones. He cost Leicester \u00a319m in the summer of 2018 so he won\u2019t come cheap, mind.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/26/alcohol-2022-football-world-cup-qatar\">Alcohol set to be subsidised and more available at 2022 World Cup in Qatar</a> </p> </aside>  <p>City may also move for Hearts\u2019 <strong>Aaron Hickey</strong> too, because Pep can\u2019t help himself when it comes to full-backs. The 17-year-old has been one of the few bright spots in an underwhelming start to the season for the Scottish Premier League side, scoring the winner in the Edinburgh derby in his last league game. <strong>Southampton</strong> are also having a nose around Tynecastle, though, and may be able to give the youngster more regular playing time if he headed to the south coast.</p> <p><strong>Manchester United</strong> are determined to get themselves one of the most popular objects in modern football: a Demb\u00e9l\u00e9. Having been linked with Barcelona\u2019s Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 on Wednesday, Old Trafford scouts are now monitoring the performances of Lyon\u2019s <strong>Moussa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9</strong> \u2013 and they have written glowing reports to slide across the desk to Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r having watched him score in the 2-2 draw at Brest. The Lyon forward is Ligue 1\u2019s joint top scorer with six goals in six games and Solskj\u00e6r may be tempted into making a sizeable bid for him in the winter transfer window after failing to replace Romelu Lukaku and Alexis Sanch\u00e9z in the summer.</p> <p>A number of tabloids say <strong>Paul Pogba </strong>is \u201cmore determined than ever\u201d to leave Manchester United in January, with <strong>Real Madrid</strong> still his most likely destination. Having played against Rochdale like he was on the phone to his super agent Mino Raiola, that would appear to be true. The thing is, the France midfielder will have to look vaguely interested if he expects Madrid \u2013 or any other potential suitor \u2013 to rescue him with a huge offer. Perhaps if United make a move for <strong>Mauricio Pochettino</strong> as manager, the sulky Frenchman will find a bit of a fizz in his game again and stick around.

      "bodyText": "With Aymeric Laporte having been ruled out for around six months with a nasty knee injury, Manchester City might be tempted into a move for another centre-back this January. Despite having missed out on Harry Maguire in the summer, Pep Guardiola\u2019s gaze is still fixed on a burly Leicester defender. And no, we won\u2019t be seeing Wes Morgan\u2019s second coming as an elite title-inspiring force at the back for a different City. The player who has got Pep rubbing his palms giddily is Caglar Soyuncu, whose outstanding displays for Brendan Rodgers\u2019 side have made Maguire\u2019s \u00a380m departure to Manchester United seem little more than a mild inconvenience. The 23-year-old has proved himself able to work the ball out from the back without gifting the ball to opposition forwards or playing ludicrous square passes to invisible teammates, so he could well be an upgrade on Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi and John Stones. He cost Leicester \u00a319m in the summer of 2018 so he won\u2019t come cheap, mind. City may also move for Hearts\u2019 Aaron Hickey too, because Pep can\u2019t help himself when it comes to full-backs. The 17-year-old has been one of the few bright spots in an underwhelming start to the season for the Scottish Premier League side, scoring the winner in the Edinburgh derby in his last league game. Southampton are also having a nose around Tynecastle, though, and may be able to give the youngster more regular playing time if he headed to the south coast. Manchester United are determined to get themselves one of the most popular objects in modern football: a Demb\u00e9l\u00e9. Having been linked with Barcelona\u2019s Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 on Wednesday, Old Trafford scouts are now monitoring the performances of Lyon\u2019s Moussa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 \u2013 and they have written glowing reports to slide across the desk to Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r having watched him score in the 2-2 draw at Brest. The Lyon forward is Ligue 1\u2019s joint top scorer with six goals in six games and Solskj\u00e6r may be tempted into making a sizeable bid for him in the winter transfer window after failing to replace Romelu Lukaku and Alexis Sanch\u00e9z in the summer. A number of tabloids say Paul Pogba is \u201cmore determined than ever\u201d to leave Manchester United in January, with Real Madrid still his most likely destination. Having played against Rochdale like he was on the phone to his super agent Mino Raiola, that would appear to be true. The thing is, the France midfielder will have to look vaguely interested if he expects Madrid \u2013 or any other potential suitor \u2013 to rescue him with a huge offer. Perhaps if United make a move for Mauricio Pochettino as manager, the sulky Frenchman will find a bit of a fizz in his game again and stick around. It says here that United are ready to activate a \u00a332m release clause to get their hands on the Spurs manager, who seems about as happy at Tottenham as Pogba is at United. Newcastle have been scouting Rochdale\u2019s Luke Matheson for the past year and now that he\u2019s scored against Manchester United they may be tempted to throw in a bid for the 16-year-old. More likely, though, is that someone else who had never heard of him until that goal, will gazump the north-east club.

      "bodyText": "Peter Dutton is seeking to appeal in the high court a federal court ruling relating to dozens of medical transfers of asylum seekers and refugees. The government argued the federal court had no jurisdiction to hear cases brought on behalf of refugees and asylum seekers in offshore centres on Manus Island and Nauru, who were seeking urgent medical transfer to Australia. The government\u2019s suit was in response to more than 50 individual cases brought on behalf of refugees and asylum seekers offshore, of which the majority remain before the federal court as ongoing legal matters, said George Newhouse, chief executive of the National Justice Project. The cases were brought by lawyers attempting to expedite medical transfers of sick refugees and asylum seekers to Australia from Nauru and Manus Island. Among the many court cases, dozens resulted in court orders, while others had the government agree \u2013 either during the hearing or prior to the case commencing \u2013 to transfer them as requested. The four test cases at the centre of this dispute are represented by the National Justice Project and Maurice Blackburn lawyers. Before the federal court, the government argued the high court was the only court which could hear cases against the commonwealth relating to a \u201ctransitory person\u201d \u2013 someone sent offshore for processing \u2013 but in late August the full bench of the federal court found against the government. On Friday, the government confirmed it has applied to the high court for special leave to appeal the four cases which \u201crelate to the correct jurisdiction in which medical transfer proceedings should be commenced\u201d. \u201cThese proceedings will not impact the transfer of individuals for medical treatment,\u201d the spokesman said, adding that they would not comment further as the matter was now once again before the court. Newhouse accused Dutton and the government of \u201ctrying to evade its legal obligations to hundreds of refugees and asylum seekers by making it harder for them to access justice in Australia\u201d. In recent weeks Dutton has decried the expense of asylum seekers appealing their cases through Australia\u2019s court system, most notably in relation to the Tamil family who face deportation back to Sri Lanka after living in Biloela for some years. In October Guardian Australia reported the government had spent almost half a million dollars on external legal fees in a three-month period, responding to legal action over sick people on Nauru who were seeking emergency medical transfer to Australia. Newhouse said the case was of particular importance given the government was attempting to repeal the medevac laws which now legislate a more expeditious process for transferring sick people to Australia. Previous analyses have shown that under the old system, the government was often ignoring the advice of its own health providers, and delaying the transfers of some individuals for as long as five years after it was first recommended. Should medevac be repealed, lawyers intend to launch compensation claims for those still in Manus Island and Nauru, Fairfax reported earlier this month.",

The man, who can only be identified by the pseudonym JCB, was raped by Ridsdale in April 1982. At the time, he was nine years old and Ridsdale was the parish priest at St Colman\u2019s church in the town of Mortlake. In February 2018, the man sued two former bishops in charge of the diocese of Ballarat, and later added the diocese as a defendant. On Friday, his lawyer revealed that the church had agreed to settle. Ridsdale, who is currently in prison, has been convicted of multiple counts of sexual abuse of 65 children, over 40 years as his career as a priest. In 2016, the royal commission into child sexual abuse heard that the Catholic church in Victoria knew of Ridsdale\u2019s sexual abuse and moved him from parish to parish. In a defence filed to JCB\u2019s claim in May 2018, the church admitted that Ridsdale had abused JCB. JCB sued the Diocese of Ballarat in a civil case for negligence, alleging they breached their duty of care to him by allowing Ridsdale to continue as a priest, and moving him to new parishes, even after they had received complaints against him. The victim claimed damages, including aggravated and exemplary damages. His lawsuit was allowed by the abolition of the \u201cEllis defence\u201d, which previously held that church assets could not be targeted by compensation for sex abuse victims. On Friday, one of his lawyers, Chris Atmore, told Guardian Australia that the settlement, and the church\u2019s admission, would \u201cdirectly and indirectly\u201d help other victims. \u201cThanks to the persistence of JCD we have dragged that admission from them and they can\u2019t resile from it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s done now.\u201d Lawyer Judy Courtin also told the ABC that the settlement for her client was \u201ca landmark\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s only been in the last year and a bit that it was possible to take the Catholic church to court, to sue them,\u201d she said. \u201cThe doors are opening, and so they should.

Against a backdrop of silver streamers and placards from the pro-choice rally that has just taken place, a small crowd gathers as Sister Ghost blast out a rendition of Nirvana\u2019s Love Buzz. Vocalist Shannon Delores O\u2019Neill sings in impassioned yelps, continually falling to her knees, eyes closed, and dropping the microphone at the end of the song. Nirvana played the track at the first ever Rock for Choice benefit in Hollywood, California, in 1991. Sister Ghost are performing it at a fundraiser for the same cause.</p> <p>Amid the threat posed by Brexit, civil rights struggles and a paramilitary resurgence, the political situation in Northern Ireland remains fragile. The country is gasping in a political vacuum without a functioning government since 2017, after disagreements between the two main parties, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn F\u00e9in, signalled the end of their power-sharing agreement. The killing of journalist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/lyra-mckee\">Lyra McKee</a> in April (for which the New IRA has admitted responsibility) and the attacks on police in Fermanagh and Craigavon suggest that slipping back into pre-1998 chaos is not a distant danger.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c936df46f2dfd3e3ce07f01c646f48029387e06f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c936df46f2dfd3e3ce07f01c646f48029387e06f/0_106_1600_960/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gender Chores\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gender Chores.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nance Hall</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Many Northern Irish musicians are channelling their anger through song. And the central target has become the DUP, the rightwing, pro-Union, Eurosceptic party who have consistently blocked equal marriage legislation and abortion reform.</p> <p>At Rock for Choice, subtlety is not in the vocabulary of the feminist punk outfit Gender Chores. Their sound is fast, loud and angry; their unrelenting basslines and hard-edged melodies are imbued with anti-patriarchy lyrics yelled with an unmistakable Ulster cadence. Following their late-afternoon slot, the band chat animatedly with the other acts. \u201cThere\u2019s no point in dancing around it, you may as well just say what you\u2019re going to say,\u201d declares lead vocalist Samantha McCann, with pro-choice slogan The North Is Now written across her thighs and exposed through ripped fishnet tights. \u201cWe are driven by frustration more than anything else. We\u2019re writing about issues that affect us and we\u2019re singing to an audience also affected by those issues.\u201d</p> <p>From traditional rebel songs to the fiery Belfast punk scene of the 70s, for decades music has been a way to voice discontent in the region. Stiff Little Fingers called for an Alternative Ulster in 1978: did these bands think people would still be shouting about it 41 years later? \u201cWe definitely wouldn\u2019t have the opportunities we have if bands like the Undertones and Rudi hadn\u2019t paved the way for us,\u201d says Gender Chores drummer AJ Mawhinney. \u201cIt\u2019s important to carry that on with a modern twist given what\u2019s going on now.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We\u2019ve seen our friends affected firsthand by legislation in Northern Ireland denying LGBT rights</p> <footer> <cite>Gareth Murray, Hand Models</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cWhen it comes to the local music scene, we\u2019re all quite political anyway, so the role comes quite naturally,\u201d McCann says. \u201cWe show up to protests, sign petitions and take part in grassroots movements.\u201d For Mawhinney, Northern Ireland\u2019s situation makes cheap fuel for punk\u2019s fire: \u201cWe\u2019re surrounded by a lot of political turmoil at the moment, so the songs almost write themselves. We are three angry people and there\u2019s just a wealth of material here.

      "bodyText": "The dark upstairs room of an old sports bar in Belfast is an unassuming venue for a revolution. Against a backdrop of silver streamers and placards from the pro-choice rally that has just taken place, a small crowd gathers as Sister Ghost blast out a rendition of Nirvana\u2019s Love Buzz. Vocalist Shannon Delores O\u2019Neill sings in impassioned yelps, continually falling to her knees, eyes closed, and dropping the microphone at the end of the song. Nirvana played the track at the first ever Rock for Choice benefit in Hollywood, California, in 1991. Sister Ghost are performing it at a fundraiser for the same cause. Amid the threat posed by Brexit, civil rights struggles and a paramilitary resurgence, the political situation in Northern Ireland remains fragile. The country is gasping in a political vacuum without a functioning government since 2017, after disagreements between the two main parties, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn F\u00e9in, signalled the end of their power-sharing agreement. The killing of journalist Lyra McKee in April (for which the New IRA has admitted responsibility) and the attacks on police in Fermanagh and Craigavon suggest that slipping back into pre-1998 chaos is not a distant danger. Many Northern Irish musicians are channelling their anger through song. And the central target has become the DUP, the rightwing, pro-Union, Eurosceptic party who have consistently blocked equal marriage legislation and abortion reform. At Rock for Choice, subtlety is not in the vocabulary of the feminist punk outfit Gender Chores. Their sound is fast, loud and angry; their unrelenting basslines and hard-edged melodies are imbued with anti-patriarchy lyrics yelled with an unmistakable Ulster cadence. Following their late-afternoon slot, the band chat animatedly with the other acts. \u201cThere\u2019s no point in dancing around it, you may as well just say what you\u2019re going to say,\u201d declares lead vocalist Samantha McCann, with pro-choice slogan The North Is Now written across her thighs and exposed through ripped fishnet tights. \u201cWe are driven by frustration more than anything else. We\u2019re writing about issues that affect us and we\u2019re singing to an audience also affected by those issues.\u201d From traditional rebel songs to the fiery Belfast punk scene of the 70s, for decades music has been a way to voice discontent in the region. Stiff Little Fingers called for an Alternative Ulster in 1978: did these bands think people would still be shouting about it 41 years later? \u201cWe definitely wouldn\u2019t have the opportunities we have if bands like the Undertones and Rudi hadn\u2019t paved the way for us,\u201d says Gender Chores drummer AJ Mawhinney. \u201cIt\u2019s important to carry that on with a modern twist given what\u2019s going on now.\u201d \u201cWhen it comes to the local music scene, we\u2019re all quite political anyway, so the role comes quite naturally,\u201d McCann says. \u201cWe show up to protests, sign petitions and take part in grassroots movements.\u201d For Mawhinney, Northern Ireland\u2019s situation makes cheap fuel for punk\u2019s fire: \u201cWe\u2019re surrounded by a lot of political turmoil at the moment, so the songs almost write themselves. We are three angry people and there\u2019s just a wealth of material here. Bands that sing about topics like abortion and marriage equality are kind of CC-ing the DUP, even if they\u2019re not explicitly saying it.\u201d Gender Chores are not a band to mince their message. Legisl8, a song about the rights dictated by the DUP, calls out the party\u2019s leader Arlene Foster with a rather moving play on words: \u201cFoster love and lose the hate / Foster, love and legislate.\u201d The title track of the band\u2019s EP Womansplaining declares: \u201cI don\u2019t need to hear your thoughts / On women\u2019s rights and Brexit talks.\u201d The cover depicts the members sprawled against the currently empty Northern Irish Assembly building Stormont; the inner cover notes the number of days Northern Ireland has been without government at the time of its release. Some of the most angry songs about the DUP come from artists who do not usually make political work. The folk songwriter Joshua Burnside isn\u2019t inclined to screaming, punk-style protest. His song Red and White Blues, taking its name from the loyalist tradition of painting kerbstones during the summer bonfire season, reflects on his experience growing up with staunch loyalist family members, including a grandfather in the DUP. \u201cIt protests a mentality of \u2018them and us\u2019 and political tribalism, harnessing culture for divisive purposes,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are people in my own family who would disagree with some of the sentiments.\u201d But \u201ceven if you change one person\u2019s way of thinking about a political situation or dynamic, then that\u2019s an enormous achievement. But it\u2019s not something I really focus on; your politics just comes out naturally in your music.\u201d Likewise, garage rockers Hand Models\u2019 song Last Leaves on a Tree was not written with the intention of being a protest, but the final chorus erupts into surprise chants of \u201cFuck the DUP!\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve seen our friends affected firsthand by legislation in Northern Ireland denying LGBT rights,\u201d explains frontman Gareth Murray.

      "body": "<p>In 2014, Chinese artist Ai Weiwei still had his passport withheld by the Beijing authorities, denying him foreign travel. While he was pondering a new exhibit about political prisoners, Ai was contacted by the San Francisco gallerist and curator <a href=\"https://www.joyouspersistence.com/cheryl\">Cheryl Haines</a> with a proposal: she had the connections to provide him with a sensational site for the event \u2013 Alcatraz prison, the former US federal penitentiary, closed since 1963 and now a tourist destination.</p> <p>They agreed that this would be a dramatic showcase, and would relate to Alcatraz\u2019s shabby 19th-century record of imprisoning Hopi Native Americans who refused to be \u201cAmericanised\u201d in their education, and also honour the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupation_of_Alcatraz\">Native American protest-occupation of Alcatraz</a> Island in 1969. Haines has now directed a very absorbing and valuable documentary about the creation of this artwork, which relates to Ai\u2019s honourable record of using <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/sep/24/ai-weiwei-alcatraz-lego-extraordinary\">art as memorialist-activism</a>.</p> <p>It includes powerful interviews with Ai\u2019s mother Gao Ying and brother Ai Xuan, and movingly puts Ai\u2019s work into personal context \u2013 that is, the Chinese government\u2019s treatment in the 1950s of Ai\u2019s late father, the dissident poet Ai Qing, transported to a remote labour camp with his wife and two young sons who were the intimate witnesses to Ai\u2019s brutalisation and humiliation. This was the horrendous experience that drove this event, and perhaps Ai\u2019s career.</p> <p>Ai effectively created the installation \u2013 entitled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/sep/24/ai-weiwei-alcatraz-lego-extraordinary\">@Large</a> \u2013 at long distance, with Haines travelling back and forth between China and the US to discuss it. The centrepiece would be a gallery of political prisoners from countries around the world, rendered with Lego bricks in a kind of analogue-pixellation, with visitors encouraged to write morale-boosting prepaid postcards to the prisoner of their choice, inspired by a postcard of support that Ai Qing himself received. The exhibit was a huge success, with 900,000 visitors and 92,829 cards sent, including to Americans such as Chelsea Manning, the former US soldier imprisoned for disclosing documents to Wikileaks, and John Kiriakou, the former CIA analyst and anti-waterboarding campaigner, imprisoned for disclosing information to a reporter.</p> <p>After the exhibit, dozens of the people featured in it were released, including Manning, Kiriakou and indeed Ai himself, who had his passport restored to him in 2015, and it may well have been this artwork that helped create the circumstances in which this was possible.</p> <p>The events under discussion in this film are not exactly recent, and things have moved on a little. Manning is interviewed in the post-release situation created by the Obama pardon, although she was sent back to jail for refusing to comply with a grand jury investigation of Julian Assange. And there is a difficult moment when Haines\u2019s camera glimpses a Lego portrait of Aung San Suu Kyi, released since 2010, but at that stage still honoured as a human rights heroine. In 2019, the view of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/aug/28/aung-san-suu-kyi-myanmar-leader\">Suu Kyi is different</a>.</p> <p>The Chinese government may well have been embarrassed by Ai\u2019s new exhibit and by his growing international prestige \u2013 but also, perhaps, mollified by the fact that it was not simply directed at China but so many other countries, very prominently the US. So it may have been a cool piece of political diplomacy on Ai\u2019s part. But it was a tough, shrewd, persistent kind of campaigning, like the kind of old-fashioned letter-writing once encouraged by Amnesty International, and like Ai\u2019s investigative artistry in discovering and memorialising the names of children killed in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/feb/15/ai-weiwei-remembering-sichuan-earthquake\">2008 Sichuan earthquake</a>, when the government were censoring the details. Haines\u2019s brief, well-made documentary is a very worthwhile guide to this venture, and to Ai Weiwei\u2019s own tragic family history.</p> <p>\u2022Screens at the Raindance film festival in London on 28 and 29 September.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guimdWc80S4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/guimdWc80S4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>",

It includes powerful interviews with Ai\u2019s mother Gao Ying and brother Ai Xuan, and movingly puts Ai\u2019s work into personal context \u2013 that is, the Chinese government\u2019s treatment in the 1950s of Ai\u2019s late father, the dissident poet Ai Qing, transported to a remote labour camp with his wife and two young sons who were the intimate witnesses to Ai\u2019s brutalisation and humiliation. This was the horrendous experience that drove this event, and perhaps Ai\u2019s career. Ai effectively created the installation \u2013 entitled @Large \u2013 at long distance, with Haines travelling back and forth between China and the US to discuss it. The centrepiece would be a gallery of political prisoners from countries around the world, rendered with Lego bricks in a kind of analogue-pixellation, with visitors encouraged to write morale-boosting prepaid postcards to the prisoner of their choice, inspired by a postcard of support that Ai Qing himself received. The exhibit was a huge success, with 900,000 visitors and 92,829 cards sent, including to Americans such as Chelsea Manning, the former US soldier imprisoned for disclosing documents to Wikileaks, and John Kiriakou, the former CIA analyst and anti-waterboarding campaigner, imprisoned for disclosing information to a reporter. After the exhibit, dozens of the people featured in it were released, including Manning, Kiriakou and indeed Ai himself, who had his passport restored to him in 2015, and it may well have been this artwork that helped create the circumstances in which this was possible. The events under discussion in this film are not exactly recent, and things have moved on a little. Manning is interviewed in the post-release situation created by the Obama pardon, although she was sent back to jail for refusing to comply with a grand jury investigation of Julian Assange. And there is a difficult moment when Haines\u2019s camera glimpses a Lego portrait of Aung San Suu Kyi, released since 2010, but at that stage still honoured as a human rights heroine. In 2019, the view of Suu Kyi is different. The Chinese government may well have been embarrassed by Ai\u2019s new exhibit and by his growing international prestige \u2013 but also, perhaps, mollified by the fact that it was not simply directed at China but so many other countries, very prominently the US. So it may have been a cool piece of political diplomacy on Ai\u2019s part. But it was a tough, shrewd, persistent kind of campaigning, like the kind of old-fashioned letter-writing once encouraged by Amnesty International, and like Ai\u2019s investigative artistry in discovering and memorialising the names of children killed in the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, when the government were censoring the details. Haines\u2019s brief, well-made documentary is a very worthwhile guide to this venture, and to Ai Weiwei\u2019s own tragic family history. \u2022Screens at the Raindance film festival in London on 28 and 29 September.",

      "bodyText": "Brexit uncertainty has pushed the UK economy to the brink of a recession, according to a Guardian analysis of economic news over the past month. The odds were evenly balanced that the economy would slide into two consecutive quarters of contraction \u2013 the definition of a recession \u2013 as the threat of a no-deal Brexit took its toll on business and consumer confidence. The economy contracted by 0.2% in the second quarter of the year. Predictions for the three months to the end of September vary from a second contraction of 0.2%, which would fulfil the criterion of a recession, to a positive o.2%. Analysts said the troubled UK economy was slowing against the backdrop of Donald Trump\u2019s trade war with China, which has dragged on global growth more than was expected in February 2018 when the US president first threatened Beijing with higher import tariffs. The tariffs directly affect only a relatively small percentage of global trade but Washington\u2019s persistent threats to widen their scope and target the EU and India have had a chilling effect on business investment and manufacturing production. Germany is poised to enter a recession, China\u2019s economic growth has stalled and while GDP is still expanding in the US , growth has slowed to half the rate it enjoyed 18 months ago. Uncertainty surrounding Britain\u2019s exit from the EU has added to the growing fear of a more comprehensive global downturn that could push the world economy into recession, possibly as early as next year. The incoming boss of the International Monetary Fund, Kristalina Georgieva, said earlier this week that a fresh global economic downturn was on the horizon. She said faltering economic growth, trade tensions and historically high debt levels put the IMF on alert for a global downturn that could increase unemployment and inequality. The UK government\u2019s response came on 4 September when Sajid Javid promised the largest increase in public spending in more than 15 years. The chancellor outlined a \u00a313.8bn package that committed the government to a 4.1% increase in expenditure from 2019-20 to 2020-21. As an attempt to draw a line under the era of austerity, analysts said it fell well short of its objective but the extra spending on the police, health service and schools and a boost for public infrastructure made clear ministers were prepared to break their own spending rules to maintain economic growth. Writing in the Guardian, David Blanchflower, a former member of the Bank of England\u2019s interest rate setting committee, said the parallels with the period before the banking crash in 2008 were too close to ignore. He said a decline in consumer sentiment reported in European commission surveys was startling and showed public was become increasingly nervous about the future. He said: \u201cOf particular note are the reports of consumers in that EU survey. Since 1985 the series average is -12. In August 2019 the series fell to a low of -36; it was -34 in April 2008. Consumers are also expecting a big rise in unemployment.\u201d Blanchflower, a professor of economics at the Ivy League Dartmouth College in the US, was the only member of the monetary policy committee to vote for interest rate cuts in early 2008, well ahead of the Lehman Brothers collapse in September that year.

      "body": "<p>Last year, Brett Anderson \u2013 the lithe and elegantly brooding frontman of Suede \u2013 revealed himself as a lithe and charming memoirist. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/feb/15/coal-black-mornings-brett-anderson-review\" title=\"\"><em>Coal Black Mornings</em></a> was an anti-rockstar chronicle, dedicated to his eccentric childhood on a housing estate in Haywards Heath in Sussex; his gruff, depressive, Liszt-obsessed father; his arty, stifled mother; his first forays into music and creativity. It detailed the early days of Suede, in the late 1980s and early 90s, the poverty, the failures, the bad decisions and inept songwriting. It ended, with admirable perversity, the day the band got signed.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Distancing devices, and their invitations to read between the lines, imbue this book with an almost novelistic quality</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The book was at times a little unpolished, but it brimmed with emotional authenticity and a kind of studied guilelessness: Anderson above all wanted to avoid a hackneyed inventory of salaciousness and surfeit, the usual tale of \u201ccoke and gold discs\u201d. But he had a problem \u2013 the memoir was a success. And the publishers, presumably, wanted more. Now he has gone back on his word, producing \u201cthe book I said I wouldn\u2019t write\u201d.</p> <p><em>Afternoons With the Blinds Drawn</em> follows Anderson through the next decade of triumph and disintegration. It begins with the motley crew-members \u201cblinking from the debris of our rented rooms\u201d into the glare of celebrity. In 1992 Suede were hailed by Melody Maker as the best new band in Britain. They were yet to release their debut single. Some saw them as overhyped poseurs; others lauded their androgynous aesthetic, their David Bowie and Lloyd Cole-influenced blend of leftfield rock, wiry pop and punkish lullaby, their songs of love in the gutter, jealousy and dissipation, trash and glitz.</p> <p>Anderson developed a distinctive (and easy to parody) lexicon of urban decay and addled ardour, and, following the band\u2019s eponymous first album \u2013 assisted by guitarist and fellow songwriter Bernard Butler \u2013 branched out to produce the gutsily wide-ranging second album <em>Dog Man Star</em> (1995), filled with soaring choruses, virtuosic guitar solos and, at one point, a 40-piece orchestra. Rolling Stone derided it as \u201cpretentious\u201d; fans lapped it up. By this stage Butler had jumped ship. Yet the next album, <em>Coming Up</em> (1996), proved they could do it without him. Further fame, infamy and fractiousness were to come. Not to mention lots and lots of drugs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e43238e402410374ae9c8142d2fba9bf740edd7c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e43238e402410374ae9c8142d2fba9bf740edd7c/28_20_1660_2023/821.jpg\" alt=\"Brett Anderson at home in Notting Hill, 2002\" width=\"821\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The band split in 2003 \u2013 where this memoir ends \u2013 only to reform in 2010.\u2019 Brett Anderson at home in Notting Hill, 2002.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Anderson writes with a combination of guarded introspection and detachment that will be familiar to readers of the earlier book. In many ways he has stayed true to his promise: this is not a tale of glamour and stardom, of backstage shenanigans and adoring fans.

      "bodyText": "Last year, Brett Anderson \u2013 the lithe and elegantly brooding frontman of Suede \u2013 revealed himself as a lithe and charming memoirist. Coal Black Mornings was an anti-rockstar chronicle, dedicated to his eccentric childhood on a housing estate in Haywards Heath in Sussex; his gruff, depressive, Liszt-obsessed father; his arty, stifled mother; his first forays into music and creativity. It detailed the early days of Suede, in the late 1980s and early 90s, the poverty, the failures, the bad decisions and inept songwriting. It ended, with admirable perversity, the day the band got signed. The book was at times a little unpolished, but it brimmed with emotional authenticity and a kind of studied guilelessness: Anderson above all wanted to avoid a hackneyed inventory of salaciousness and surfeit, the usual tale of \u201ccoke and gold discs\u201d. But he had a problem \u2013 the memoir was a success. And the publishers, presumably, wanted more. Now he has gone back on his word, producing \u201cthe book I said I wouldn\u2019t write\u201d. Afternoons With the Blinds Drawn follows Anderson through the next decade of triumph and disintegration. It begins with the motley crew-members \u201cblinking from the debris of our rented rooms\u201d into the glare of celebrity. In 1992 Suede were hailed by Melody Maker as the best new band in Britain. They were yet to release their debut single. Some saw them as overhyped poseurs; others lauded their androgynous aesthetic, their David Bowie and Lloyd Cole-influenced blend of leftfield rock, wiry pop and punkish lullaby, their songs of love in the gutter, jealousy and dissipation, trash and glitz. Anderson developed a distinctive (and easy to parody) lexicon of urban decay and addled ardour, and, following the band\u2019s eponymous first album \u2013 assisted by guitarist and fellow songwriter Bernard Butler \u2013 branched out to produce the gutsily wide-ranging second album Dog Man Star (1995), filled with soaring choruses, virtuosic guitar solos and, at one point, a 40-piece orchestra. Rolling Stone derided it as \u201cpretentious\u201d; fans lapped it up. By this stage Butler had jumped ship. Yet the next album, Coming Up (1996), proved they could do it without him. Further fame, infamy and fractiousness were to come. Not to mention lots and lots of drugs. Anderson writes with a combination of guarded introspection and detachment that will be familiar to readers of the earlier book. In many ways he has stayed true to his promise: this is not a tale of glamour and stardom, of backstage shenanigans and adoring fans. The author is less concerned with the events themselves than with the atmosphere that produced them, what he refers to as \u201cthe machinery that whirrs away, often unseen \u2026 to create the bands that people hear\u201d. He is under no illusions about the contract between artist and audience (\u201cany performance is essentially an elitist act\u201d), and writes lucidly about the construction of his persona, the \u201cunholy loop\u201d of reflection and refraction as he posed for a media that fed its portrayal back into him (\u201cI don\u2019t think I was ever particularly in control\u201d). He is very good on the imaginative mechanics of his songwriting, on the relationship between his lyrics and the music, on the way a band can work together, and apart, on the lengths gone to between the spark of inspiration and a piece\u2019s layered construction in a studio. He is generally more rueful than celebratory, and is especially self-critical about the curation of his albums. As he acknowledges, several of Suede\u2019s best numbers were B-sides. His \u201clightest\u201d, poppiest hit, \u201cShe\u2019s in Fashion\u201d, was \u201cborn from the ravages of utter despair\u201d; the chart top-fiver \u201cElectricity\u201d is \u201cshouty, pointless, hollow \u2026 signifying absolutely nothing\u201d. His favourite lyric is \u201cAsphalt World\u201d and the song he\u2019d choose to define his work is \u201cThe Wild Ones\u201d. He is sober about his ability: \u201cI\u2019m not an especially talented musician nor an artistic visionary nor even a particularly gifted storyteller \u2026 I simply never give up.\u201d There was debauchery, but Anderson does not glory in the details. His overriding mode is euphemism: \u201cInevitably we overdid it.\u201d Crack cocaine and heroin are never mentioned; the philandering remains in the shadows; names are never dropped.

After David Littleproud confirmed he could not provide the parliament with Joyce\u2019s report, as requested by Labor, as \u201che did not prepare a final report, and as such, no document exists,\u201d the opposition went on the attack, declaring Joyce\u2019s role to be a farce. Joyce angrily defended his work, and said he had sent regular text messages to the prime minister reporting what he had found. That seemed to surprise Morrison, who responded to a journalist\u2019s question asking about the text messages with \u201cwell, you said text message, not me, I said he wrote to us, he presented reports . ..\u201d before pivoting when told it was Joyce who had referred to text messages. \u201cWell he did,\u201d Morrison said, barely skipping a beat. \u201cAnd Barnaby is a master of all forms of communication.

He said the parts of the additional drought package announced on Friday were crafted following Joyce\u2019s advice, including the extension of the drought communities program, and additional funding for rural financial councillors and addressing weeds and pests, adding \u201cI would say he was pretty optimal\u201d. The additional drought funding was timed for Morrison\u2019s arrival back in the country, with the prime minister having made reference to his Queensland trip in his final press conference in the US, in response to a question about what he had learnt about America during his visit. Just over half of the $100m package will go to the Farm Household Allowance, which has been subjected to incremental administrative changes since Littleproud took hold of the portfolio governing it. The latest changes aim to continue to simplify the process, which enables assistance to be paid to eligible farmers, at the Newstart rate. Another $33m of the latest package will extend the drought community support initiative, which sees charities, including St Vincent de Paul and the Salvation Army, provide emergency financial support of up to $3,000 to eligible farmers. Charities are often used during natural disasters to administer funds, to ensure the money is provided as quickly as possible.

Texas lobbyist Jeff Miller, who has several big fossil fuel clients and ran energy secretary Rick Perry\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign, raised about $1m in this year\u2019s second quarter for the Trump Victory Committee, campaign filings show. The stellar fundraising by figures like Murray and Miller highlight an early spurt of fossil fuel backing for Trump\u2019s re-election as his campaign gears up, according to analysts and campaign finance reports. Leading coal, oil and gas CEOs and some industry lobbyists are ponying up millions of dollars to help Trump win in 2020, after reaping a regulatory windfall that has benefited some of their bottom lines during Trump\u2019s first term. However, many of these pro-fossil fuel victories came via executive orders and regulatory actions and could be reversed if a Democrat wins in 2020 \u2013 perhaps showing why the fossil fuel industry is backing Trump\u2019s re-election so aggressively. While a few of Trump\u2019s biggest fossil fuel backers wrote six figure checks to his campaign and allied super Pacs in 2016, their wallets opened much wider after Trump won, giving millions of dollars to his inaugural committee, and to independent groups promoting Trump\u2019s deregulatory agenda. Trump\u2019s drive to boost fossil fuels by slashing regulations includes: withdrawing from the landmark 2015 Paris climate change accord which 195 countries signed to help reduce rising global temperatures; ending the Obama administration\u2019s Clean Power rules to curb coal-fired power plant emissions; and sharply limiting an Obama-era regulation aimed at reducing methane emissions, an even more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. Watchdog groups are dismayed at the influence fossil fuel bigwigs have received from the Trump administration which tapped two former energy lobbyists to run the Environmental Protection Agency and interior department. \u201cThere is a certain swampy symbiosis to it all,\u201d said Robert Maguire, research director at Crew which monitors ethics issues. \u201cWhile coal, oil and gas interests generously fill President Trump\u2019s war chest, his administration gives them something that\u2019s arguably even more valuable: former industry lobbyists in positions of power at agencies that impact their bottom line, and a deregulatory agenda that reads like a wishlist written by the fossil fuel industry.\u201d Similarly, Jerry Taylor, who heads the nonpartisan Niskanen Center, said that fossil fuel companies may have more clout than ever with Trump in office. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to identify any industrial sector that has ever had this much success with any administration in modern history.

Besides Murray and Miller, other early big Trump energy donors include Kelcy Warren who heads Energy Transfer, a Texas firm that constructed the controversial Dakota Access pipeline project which in early 2017 got a green light when the army approved a final permit for building it.

Murray himself was at EPA headquarters in March 2017 when Trump signed an executive order telling the then EPA administrator, Scott Pruitt, to start dismantling Obama\u2019s Clean Power plan. Other coal industry titans like billionaire Joe Craft, the CEO of the nation\u2019s third-largest coal company Alliance Resource Partners, have been riding high in the Trump era.

When the day comes that I achieve something of professional import that has implications on the very notion of democracy, will I too be put through the media wringer?

      "bodyText": "For all the talk of an industry in crisis, you have to hand it to the British media for their ability to get to the nub of a story. It was, one imagines, with a gasp of triumph that the Daily Mail was able to deliver a stinging blow to the president of the supreme court, Lady Hale, she of the spider brooch and the damning verdict on our prime minister\u2019s prorogation wheeze. Via a stunned headline, the paper was this week able to reveal that Hale, who graduated top of her class at Cambridge in law, who was the first woman to be appointed to the Law Commission, and the second to be appointed to the court of appeal, was in fact an \u201cex-barmaid\u201d. Truly, we must applaud this mighty organ\u2019s dogged commitment to truth and scrutiny. I do worry about what sort of precedent this sets, however. When the day comes that I achieve something of professional import that has implications on the very notion of democracy, will I too be put through the media wringer? I may not have a law degree or a seat on the most powerful court in the land but, like Hale, I am an ex-barmaid. I\u2019m also an ex-waitress, dishwasher and tour guide, and \u2013 my personal nadir \u2013 a former milk factory worker required to wear a hairnet and fetching paper suit. These jobs were executed through my late teens and early 20s with varying degrees of competency and enthusiasm. I still maintain, however, that my three years working behind a bar were the best fun I\u2019ve ever had in a job. But back to Hale and her pint-pulling shame. Imagine, for a moment, a world in which public figures were routinely labelled by their early menial jobs rather than their subsequent professional achievements. Think ex-ice-cream scooper Barack Obama, ex-coil winder Paul McCartney, ex-waitress Elizabeth Warren or ex-secretary JK Rowling. Of course, Hale isn\u2019t the first person to have a past role used as ammunition against her. Earlier this year, celebrated man of the people and Trump apologist Piers Morgan attempted to shame the activist and politician Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez for having worked as a bartender and waitress in 2018 before becoming the youngest congresswoman in US history. This came after she criticised Ivanka Trump\u2019s suitability as a diplomatic representative at the G20 summit. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s response to Morgan was suitably crisp: \u201cImagine if more people in power spent years of their lives actually working for a living,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cWe\u2019d probably have healthcare and living wages by now.\u201d While no one is suggesting there\u2019s anything heroic about waiting tables, having to make ends meet through assorted McJobs in your formative years can be character building and lead to a more rounded and compassionate view of the world.

Whether it\u2019s for the epic battery life (35 days\u2019 standby), you need a backup phone, a party phone, a festival phone or simply because you want a smartphone-free life, the Nokia 105 is everything you remember from the Nokia of old.</p> <p>It has an FM radio, charges via microUSB, has a headphone socket and a 1.8in display, on which you can even play Snake or Crossy Road. It has space for all your contacts and 100s of SMS, because you might be that popular.</p> <p>Press the up key twice to turn on a flashlight to find your keys. There\u2019s no camera, though, which some might see as an advantage. It\u2019s not a \u201crugged phone\u201d but it\u2019ll survive the odd spill no problem with its hardy plastic body. And it only weighs 73g. One caveat is that it\u2019s only 2G and as networks move to 5G, 2G coverage may suffer.</p> <p>If you need more, Nokia has a newer 3G version of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/19/nokia-3310-review-snake-t9-texts-sleek-design-camera\">reborn 3310</a> at <a href=\"https://www.johnlewis.com/nokia-3310-mobile-phone-64mb-3g-2-4-inch-qvga/azure/p3359209\">\u00a350</a> or even the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/16/nokia-8110-4g-review-nostalgia-the-matrix-banana-phone\">4G 8110</a> aka \u201cthe banana phone\u201d at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07FY5Q5QM\">\u00a345</a>.

Known for excellent phones at rock-bottom prices, the Mi A2 is no exception. Available in several versions including a \u201cLite\u201d model, the one to buy is the full-blooded Mi A2 with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage for <a href=\"https://buy.mi.com/uk/buy/product/mi-a2\">\u00a3159.50 straight from Xiaomi</a>.</p> <p>You get a good-looking 5.99in full HD+ LCD screen, solid Qualcomm Snapdragon 660 processor, with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. Best of all you get <a href=\"https://www.android.com/intl/en_uk/one/\">Android One software</a>, which means no unwanted apps or bloatware, a clean Android experience and snappy performance, plus at least two years of software updates straight from Google.</p> <p>The dual camera on the back won\u2019t win you any photography awards, but will do for the odd snap of people or landscapes. The battery should last a day, and it has quick wireless charging via the modern USB-C port. The fingerprint scanner on the back makes unlocking it a breeze and it even supports Bluetooth 5 (useful for modern wireless headphones) and dual-sim for two network connections at once (great for traveling). There\u2019s no headphone socket, though.</p> <p><strong>Verdict</strong></p> <p>Bloat-free Android One software, snappy performance and modern features often reserved for phones at much higher price points make the Xiaomi Mi A2 a bargain.</p> <h2>Under \u00a3300</h2> <p><strong>Nokia 8.1</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d4d1019bf40e2d98f5bd550bed65efb10dba4d12\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d4d1019bf40e2d98f5bd550bed65efb10dba4d12/0_0_4052_2432/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nokia\u2019s 8.1 has a good balance of features, build and cost.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nokia\u2019s 8.1 has a good balance of features, build and cost.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nokia</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>RRP:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.nokia.com/phones/en_gb/nokia-8\">\u00a3380</a> - deals from \u00a3280</p> <p>Made by HMD, a firm set up by ex-Nokia people to make new Nokia phones, the Nokia 8.1 is not quite your Nokia of old. Overpriced at \u00a3380 on launch, but just about right at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07MNB2N61/\">\u00a3100 less</a>, the Nokia 8.1 nails the basics and adds a little bit of polish.</p> <p>Under the hood you have Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon 710, which is a step up from the 6-series in much of the competition, 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, plus a microSD card slot for adding more space. It runs Android One too, which means no bloat and snappy performance, plus at least three years of updates straight from Google.</p> <p>The 6.18in LCD is pretty good too, with an iPhone-like camera notch at the top, while the metal and glass sandwich construction feels more modern and premium, although you\u2019ll probably need a case to keep it that way. A fingerprint scanner on the back takes care of unlocking the phone, there\u2019s Bluetooth 5 support and 18W fast charging via USB-C.</p> <p>Battery life is a good day of fairly heavy usage (games, video and lots of messaging), longer if you\u2019re only a light user.</p> <p>The 12-megapixel camera on the back is a cut above many at this price, but falls short of the modern miracles mastered by the top tier of phones.</p> <p><strong>Verdict</strong></p> <p>Good performance, software, build and camera make the Nokia 8.1 good value at less than \u00a3300</p> <h2>Under \u00a3500</h2> <p><strong>Google Pixel 3a</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9fa4bdb0de9648dc46495f6e15f9ae9f006375a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9fa4bdb0de9648dc46495f6e15f9ae9f006375a1/876_416_3842_2306/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pixel 3a next to its larger sibling the Pixel 3a XL.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pixel 3a next to its larger sibling the Pixel 3a XL.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>RRP:</strong> <a href=\"https://store.google.com/config/pixel_3a\">\u00a3399</a> - deals from \u00a3350</p> <p>Google\u2019s cheapest Android phone <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/may/14/google-pixel-3a-review-camera-software-bzttery-android\">is one of its best</a>, offering most of what makes its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/oct/18/google-pixel-3-review-android-performance-camera-design\">top-end Pixel 3</a> good but for about half the price.</p> <p>You get a good-looking 5.6in FHD+ OLED display in a solid-feeling but light polycarbonate body. The back of the phone is two-tone, with a glossy panel at the top. There\u2019s a USB-C port in the bottom for fast charging and the lesser-spotted headphones socket in the top.</p> <p>A an excellent fingerprint scanner on the back takes care of unlocking the phone, while Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon 670, 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage keeps things clocking along for about a day.</p> <p>The Pixel 3a has two big advantages over everything else at this price. The first is Google\u2019s great software, with three-years of updates, day and date with the release of each new Android version, where some other manufacturers take over six months to update their phones.</p> <p>The second is Google\u2019s stellar camera, which matches flagship smartphones in both picture quality and night sight. Nothing comes close at under \u00a3500.</p> <p><strong>Verdict</strong></p> <p>Cracking camera and excellent software with rapid updates make the Pixel 3a a winner at \u00a3400</p> <h2>Under \u00a31,000</h2> <p><strong>OnePlus 7 Pro</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"067986e4e3862c4725021bf2f509b1801e1dd670\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/067986e4e3862c4725021bf2f509b1801e1dd670/549_509_3830_2299/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The OnePlus 7 Pro comes in 4G and 5G versions, which are identical apart from mobile broadband speed.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The OnePlus 7 Pro comes in 4G and 5G versions, which are identical apart from mobile broadband speed.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>RRP:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.oneplus.com/uk/oneplus-7pro\">\u00a3649</a> - deals from \u00a3600</p> <p>Simply put, if you want <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/mar/06/best-smartphone-iphone-samsung-google-huawei-ios-android-buyers-guide-compared-ranked\">the best phone right now</a> that\u2019s the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/may/31/oneplus-7-pro-review-an-absolute-beast-in-every-way\">OnePlus 7 Pro</a>. Available in both 4G and 5G variants, the OnePlus offers the fastest, smoothest experience available even though it\u2019s almost half the price of some rivals.</p> <p>It starts with the giant, notchless 6.67in QHD+ AMOLED screen which is the best in the business: super bright, super sharp and with a 90Hz refresh rate (versus 60Hz for the competition) making everything super smooth. A best-in-class fast and accurate fingerprint sensor under the screen takes care of unlocking duties, while the selfie camera literally pops up from the top.</p> <p>Performance is equally stellar, with Qualcomm\u2019s top of the line Snapdragon 855 chip, at least 6GB of RAM and 128GB of UFS3 storage (which is faster than the competition too). The battery will last well into your second day between charges, with very fast cable charging when needed.</p> <p>OnePlus\u2019s slick Android OxygenOS is excellent too, and updated rapidly for at least three years.

So here\u2019s a guide to some of the best phones at different price points, so you don\u2019t end up buying a dud. Under \u00a350 Nokia 105 RRP: \u00a325 - deals from \u00a315 If you just want a phone to call and old-style text, then the Nokia 105, costing just \u00a315-odd, is worth looking at. Whether it\u2019s for the epic battery life (35 days\u2019 standby), you need a backup phone, a party phone, a festival phone or simply because you want a smartphone-free life, the Nokia 105 is everything you remember from the Nokia of old. It has an FM radio, charges via microUSB, has a headphone socket and a 1.8in display, on which you can even play Snake or Crossy Road. It has space for all your contacts and 100s of SMS, because you might be that popular. Press the up key twice to turn on a flashlight to find your keys. There\u2019s no camera, though, which some might see as an advantage. It\u2019s not a \u201crugged phone\u201d but it\u2019ll survive the odd spill no problem with its hardy plastic body. And it only weighs 73g. One caveat is that it\u2019s only 2G and as networks move to 5G, 2G coverage may suffer. If you need more, Nokia has a newer 3G version of the reborn 3310 at \u00a350 or even the 4G 8110 aka \u201cthe banana phone\u201d at \u00a345. Nostalgia trip included. Verdict Harking back to a simpler time, the Nokia 105 is dirt cheap and gets the job done Under \u00a3150 Xiaomi Mi A2 RRP: \u00a3259 - deals from \u00a3149.99 Xiaomi, once described as China\u2019s Apple, isn\u2019t a household name in the UK, but perhaps it should be. Known for excellent phones at rock-bottom prices, the Mi A2 is no exception. Available in several versions including a \u201cLite\u201d model, the one to buy is the full-blooded Mi A2 with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage for \u00a3159.50 straight from Xiaomi. You get a good-looking 5.99in full HD+ LCD screen, solid Qualcomm Snapdragon 660 processor, with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. Best of all you get Android One software, which means no unwanted apps or bloatware, a clean Android experience and snappy performance, plus at least two years of software updates straight from Google. The dual camera on the back won\u2019t win you any photography awards, but will do for the odd snap of people or landscapes. The battery should last a day, and it has quick wireless charging via the modern USB-C port. The fingerprint scanner on the back makes unlocking it a breeze and it even supports Bluetooth 5 (useful for modern wireless headphones) and dual-sim for two network connections at once (great for traveling). There\u2019s no headphone socket, though. Verdict Bloat-free Android One software, snappy performance and modern features often reserved for phones at much higher price points make the Xiaomi Mi A2 a bargain. Under \u00a3300 Nokia 8.1 RRP: \u00a3380 - deals from \u00a3280 Made by HMD, a firm set up by ex-Nokia people to make new Nokia phones, the Nokia 8.1 is not quite your Nokia of old. Overpriced at \u00a3380 on launch, but just about right at \u00a3100 less, the Nokia 8.1 nails the basics and adds a little bit of polish. Under the hood you have Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon 710, which is a step up from the 6-series in much of the competition, 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, plus a microSD card slot for adding more space. It runs Android One too, which means no bloat and snappy performance, plus at least three years of updates straight from Google. The 6.18in LCD is pretty good too, with an iPhone-like camera notch at the top, while the metal and glass sandwich construction feels more modern and premium, although you\u2019ll probably need a case to keep it that way. A fingerprint scanner on the back takes care of unlocking the phone, there\u2019s Bluetooth 5 support and 18W fast charging via USB-C. Battery life is a good day of fairly heavy usage (games, video and lots of messaging), longer if you\u2019re only a light user. The 12-megapixel camera on the back is a cut above many at this price, but falls short of the modern miracles mastered by the top tier of phones. Verdict Good performance, software, build and camera make the Nokia 8.1 good value at less than \u00a3300 Under \u00a3500 Google Pixel 3a RRP: \u00a3399 - deals from \u00a3350 Google\u2019s cheapest Android phone is one of its best, offering most of what makes its top-end Pixel 3 good but for about half the price. You get a good-looking 5.6in FHD+ OLED display in a solid-feeling but light polycarbonate body. The back of the phone is two-tone, with a glossy panel at the top. There\u2019s a USB-C port in the bottom for fast charging and the lesser-spotted headphones socket in the top. A an excellent fingerprint scanner on the back takes care of unlocking the phone, while Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon 670, 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage keeps things clocking along for about a day. The Pixel 3a has two big advantages over everything else at this price. The first is Google\u2019s great software, with three-years of updates, day and date with the release of each new Android version, where some other manufacturers take over six months to update their phones. The second is Google\u2019s stellar camera, which matches flagship smartphones in both picture quality and night sight. Nothing comes close at under \u00a3500. Verdict Cracking camera and excellent software with rapid updates make the Pixel 3a a winner at \u00a3400 Under \u00a31,000 OnePlus 7 Pro RRP: \u00a3649 - deals from \u00a3600 Simply put, if you want the best phone right now that\u2019s the OnePlus 7 Pro. Available in both 4G and 5G variants, the OnePlus offers the fastest, smoothest experience available even though it\u2019s almost half the price of some rivals. It starts with the giant, notchless 6.67in QHD+ AMOLED screen which is the best in the business: super bright, super sharp and with a 90Hz refresh rate (versus 60Hz for the competition) making everything super smooth. A best-in-class fast and accurate fingerprint sensor under the screen takes care of unlocking duties, while the selfie camera literally pops up from the top. Performance is equally stellar, with Qualcomm\u2019s top of the line Snapdragon 855 chip, at least 6GB of RAM and 128GB of UFS3 storage (which is faster than the competition too). The battery will last well into your second day between charges, with very fast cable charging when needed. OnePlus\u2019s slick Android OxygenOS is excellent too, and updated rapidly for at least three years. The triple camera system on the back is great too, although bettered in some areas by Huawei\u2019s \u00a3899 P30 Pro and Apple\u2019s new \u00a31,049 iPhone 11 Pro. One caveat is that it\u2019s massive, so not for those who want a small phone; it is due to be replaced in October too, so it might be worth waiting for that. Verdict Big, fast and slick, the OnePlus 7 Pro is a joy to use The ethical alternative Fairphone 3 RRP: \u20ac450 \u2013 deals from \u00a3420 If a fixed budget or flashy features aren\u2019t your primary driver, the Fairphone 3 offers something others can\u2019t: being ethical. Made by a Dutch co-operative, the Fairphone 3 is the most repairable phone available, with a removable battery and modules you can unscrew and replace yourself (including the screen if you smash it). It\u2019s also produced in the most fair way currently possible, including ethical sourcing of raw materials where possible and bring made by people paid a living wage. Some materials cannot currently be sourced from conflict-free zones, so the firm has various schemes in place to help solve these issues, having succeeded with a Fairtrade gold initiative. The phone isn\u2019t bad either, with simple, bloat-free Android software, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 632, 4GB of RAM, 64GB of storage plus a microSD card slot and a 12-megapixel camera on the back. Verdict Fairphone 3 isn\u2019t just another smartphone: it\u2019s an entirely different way of thinking about how a phone and its creation fits into the world.",

&lt;script async src=&quot;//www.instagram.com/embed.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>\u201cI love <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/rrbookoutfit/\">matching my outfits to books</a>, which sounds so dorky, but it\u2019s just really fun,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/nayareadsandsmiles/?utm_source=ig_embed\">Nai\u2019a Perkins</a>, who splits her time between bookstagram and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/31/books/booktubers-youtube.html\">booktube</a>, told me. If she\u2019s posting about a thriller, she\u2019ll reduce exposure levels to make the photo darker, or will wear a black outfit. If it\u2019s a romance, she might wear a dress or red lipstick.</p> <p>But unlike other Instagram influencers who can make thousands of dollars for sponsored posts, bookstagrammers such as Perkins usually aren\u2019t paid for their content \u2013 instead publishers simply send the books to them in exchange for coverage, whether that\u2019s a full review or a mention on release day.</p> <p>These days, we\u2019re suspicious of anyone promoting something on Instagram. But, could it be true: they\u2019re actually in it for the love of reading? Bookstagrammers are a breed of influencer we\u2019re less familiar with \u2013 the kind that are living day-to-day what they are sharing online.</p> <p>Hikari Loftus of <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/foldedpagesdistillery/?hl=en\">Folded Pages Distillery</a> says there is still some nuance to be found. She breaks it down into two kinds of bookstagrammers: the accounts that treat the book as an aesthetic object; and those who engage with the text, posting in-depth reviews in their captions.</p> <p>She belongs to both camps. \u201cI have a bunch of crap that people would probably throw in the garbage that I use as props,\u201d Loftus told me. This includes the wrapping paper from a gift from her husband she still uses as backdrop almost daily. (When I talked to Hickey, she was moving into her college dorm, and she said part of her decision-making process when buying home decor was if they could pull double duty as bookstagram props.)</p> <p>But the hardest part of bookstagramming, Loftus said, is keeping up with the glut of new releases publishers send her, hoping she\u2019ll feature them. She loves reading, but would she be reading quite this much, this fast, if it wasn\u2019t for Instagram? Loftus estimates that she donates 50 books each month by riding her bike around her neighborhood, dropping them off in the various <a href=\"https://littlefreelibrary.org/\">Little Free Libraries</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"post two\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot;

&lt;script async src=&quot;//www.instagram.com/embed.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The free books are the main perk of bookstagram, said Jennifer Lewis of <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bluestockingbookshelf/?hl=en\">Bluestocking Bookshelf</a>. (There are occasionally partnerships with other entities \u2013 companies hawking candles or bookmarks, or PR firms \u2013 who will pay the bookstagrammers). This obviously works out well for the publishers, who in recent years have begun to view bookstagram as a vital way to promote their products. A publicist from Berkley cited <a href=\"http://insights.netgalley.com/case-study-the-kiss-quotient/\">bookstagram promotion</a> as a key part of making of 2018\u2019s The Kiss Quotient a success and in 2017, the Publishers Advertising and Marketing Association <a href=\"https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/childrens/childrens-book-news/article/73612-harnessing-bookstagram-a-pama-panel.html\">invited a group of bookstagrammers</a> to the Random House offices to discuss how publishers could build relationships with the community. All the interest in their reading habits can change how a bookstarammer reads. Lewis was inspired to challenge herself with the books she features, to make sure she\u2019s not only promoting, \u201ca lot of books by dead white people.\u201d</p> <p>The cozy world of bookstagram occasionally butts up against the sharp edges of the real world. A few years ago, Divergent author Veronica Roth released Carve the Mark, her highly anticipated fifth novel. Initial reports by booktubers were positive. Then came <a href=\"https://thewritingwhale.wordpress.com/2017/01/22/the-truth-about-carve-the-mark-and-why-sponsored-reviews-suck-rant/\">the</a> <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1884343077\">criticism</a>: the book was ableist, racist, and the early reviewers were paid shills.</p> <p>The drama! Should people who reviewed the book also be painted with the book\u2019s criticisms? Was anyone allowed to like the book? Should people condemn books they haven\u2019t read? The debate bled into bookstagram, Loftus said, to the point where any discussion of the book devolved into a mess of angry comments. According to Loftus, the maelstrom (which someone wrote their <a href=\"https://dspace.library.uu.nl/handle/1874/353856\">master\u2019s thesis</a> on) eventually led to more productive discussions: \u201cSo it started out, I think, as a pretty scary thing and over the years it has started to evolve into, not perfect, but better conversations.\u201d</p> <p>Criticism has come from the outside world, too. Last fall, a Vulture writer denounced <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2018/10/the-terrible-instagram-trend-of-piles-of-open-books.html\">bookstagrammers using books as props</a>, targeting those who pose atop books for using books as, \u201cjust another object, shorn of meaning and sometimes of binding, rearranged to show that their possessors\u2019 lives are prettier, more whimsical, more creative than yours.\u201d In 2017, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/aug/28/is-social-media-influencing-book-cover-design\">Guardian article</a> about Instagram\u2019s influence on book design provoked a slew of comments about the shallowness of readers, like the bookstagrammers quoted in the piece, who would dare judge a book by the Instagram-friendliness of its cover.</p> <p>Another bookstagrammer responded to the comments on her blog <a href=\"http://www.thebibliothequeblog.com/bookstagram-we-have-been-unfairly-attacked-and-heres-my-reply-to-each-and-every-one-of-the-comments-reaction-post-to-the-guardians-article-on-book-covers-social-media/\">in a post titled</a> \u2018Bookstagram, We Have Been Unfairly Attacked And Here\u2019s My Reply To Each And Every One Of The Comments (Reaction Post To The Guardian\u2019s Article On Book Covers &amp; Social Media)\u2018.</p> <p>Bookstagrammers know about the eyerolls from people outside their community, the notion that because they\u2019re bookstagrammers, they\u2019re can\u2019t be the \u201cright kind\u201d of reader. (It\u2019s the same brand of disgusted anger that arises when anyone dares to arrange their bookshelves by color.)</p> <p>\u201cI think books can make people really angry, because we all want to think that we\u2019re the ones that are reading correctly,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve realized that in their minds, they think that we\u2019re reducing books to objects instead of experiences. But the entire point of bookstagram is that [books] can be both, they can be visually stunning, but they can also be mentally stimulating. They\u2019re not mutually exclusive.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "A pink blanket goes with everything: Jane Austen classics, a queer young-adult romcom, fantasy novel Six of Crows. Jordan Hickey\u2019s version is crocheted, made by her grandmother, and appears in most photos on her Instagram account pagetravels, where it\u2019s paired with various books to evoke a sense of tantalizing coziness. Wouldn\u2019t you like to be here right now, her photos imply, cuddled up with this blanket and this mug of coffee, with nothing else on your to-do list aside from reading the new novel Frankly In Love, out today? Hickey is a part of \u201cbookstagram\u201d, the corner of Instagram combining a love of books with stylized, eye-catching photos, to the delight of large fanbases. The bookstagram tag has been used on over 35m Instagram posts, and the more popular bookstrammers have upwards of 100,000 followers (for comparison, the Instagram for the New York Times book section has about 69,000 followers.) There are enough people joining bookstagram that a slew of articles have cropped up, advising would-be bookstagrammers on best practice, how to manage Instagram\u2019s \u201cpesky algorithm\u201d and the best budget-friendly props. Some accounts focus on old books, or books by authors of color, many play with elaborate staging. \u201cI love matching my outfits to books, which sounds so dorky, but it\u2019s just really fun,\u201d Nai\u2019a Perkins, who splits her time between bookstagram and booktube, told me. If she\u2019s posting about a thriller, she\u2019ll reduce exposure levels to make the photo darker, or will wear a black outfit. If it\u2019s a romance, she might wear a dress or red lipstick. But unlike other Instagram influencers who can make thousands of dollars for sponsored posts, bookstagrammers such as Perkins usually aren\u2019t paid for their content \u2013 instead publishers simply send the books to them in exchange for coverage, whether that\u2019s a full review or a mention on release day. These days, we\u2019re suspicious of anyone promoting something on Instagram. But, could it be true: they\u2019re actually in it for the love of reading? Bookstagrammers are a breed of influencer we\u2019re less familiar with \u2013 the kind that are living day-to-day what they are sharing online. Hikari Loftus of Folded Pages Distillery says there is still some nuance to be found. She breaks it down into two kinds of bookstagrammers: the accounts that treat the book as an aesthetic object; and those who engage with the text, posting in-depth reviews in their captions. She belongs to both camps. \u201cI have a bunch of crap that people would probably throw in the garbage that I use as props,\u201d Loftus told me. This includes the wrapping paper from a gift from her husband she still uses as backdrop almost daily. (When I talked to Hickey, she was moving into her college dorm, and she said part of her decision-making process when buying home decor was if they could pull double duty as bookstagram props.) But the hardest part of bookstagramming, Loftus said, is keeping up with the glut of new releases publishers send her, hoping she\u2019ll feature them. She loves reading, but would she be reading quite this much, this fast, if it wasn\u2019t for Instagram? Loftus estimates that she donates 50 books each month by riding her bike around her neighborhood, dropping them off in the various Little Free Libraries. The free books are the main perk of bookstagram, said Jennifer Lewis of Bluestocking Bookshelf. (There are occasionally partnerships with other entities \u2013 companies hawking candles or bookmarks, or PR firms \u2013 who will pay the bookstagrammers). This obviously works out well for the publishers, who in recent years have begun to view bookstagram as a vital way to promote their products. A publicist from Berkley cited bookstagram promotion as a key part of making of 2018\u2019s The Kiss Quotient a success and in 2017, the Publishers Advertising and Marketing Association invited a group of bookstagrammers to the Random House offices to discuss how publishers could build relationships with the community. All the interest in their reading habits can change how a bookstarammer reads. Lewis was inspired to challenge herself with the books she features, to make sure she\u2019s not only promoting, \u201ca lot of books by dead white people.\u201d The cozy world of bookstagram occasionally butts up against the sharp edges of the real world. A few years ago, Divergent author Veronica Roth released Carve the Mark, her highly anticipated fifth novel. Initial reports by booktubers were positive. Then came the criticism: the book was ableist, racist, and the early reviewers were paid shills. The drama! Should people who reviewed the book also be painted with the book\u2019s criticisms? Was anyone allowed to like the book? Should people condemn books they haven\u2019t read? The debate bled into bookstagram, Loftus said, to the point where any discussion of the book devolved into a mess of angry comments. According to Loftus, the maelstrom (which someone wrote their master\u2019s thesis on) eventually led to more productive discussions: \u201cSo it started out, I think, as a pretty scary thing and over the years it has started to evolve into, not perfect, but better conversations.\u201d Criticism has come from the outside world, too. Last fall, a Vulture writer denounced bookstagrammers using books as props, targeting those who pose atop books for using books as, \u201cjust another object, shorn of meaning and sometimes of binding, rearranged to show that their possessors\u2019 lives are prettier, more whimsical, more creative than yours.\u201d In 2017, a Guardian article about Instagram\u2019s influence on book design provoked a slew of comments about the shallowness of readers, like the bookstagrammers quoted in the piece, who would dare judge a book by the Instagram-friendliness of its cover. Another bookstagrammer responded to the comments on her blog in a post titled \u2018Bookstagram, We Have Been Unfairly Attacked And Here\u2019s My Reply To Each And Every One Of The Comments (Reaction Post To The Guardian\u2019s Article On Book Covers &amp; Social Media)\u2018. Bookstagrammers know about the eyerolls from people outside their community, the notion that because they\u2019re bookstagrammers, they\u2019re can\u2019t be the \u201cright kind\u201d of reader. (It\u2019s the same brand of disgusted anger that arises when anyone dares to arrange their bookshelves by color.) \u201cI think books can make people really angry, because we all want to think that we\u2019re the ones that are reading correctly,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve realized that in their minds, they think that we\u2019re reducing books to objects instead of experiences. But the entire point of bookstagram is that [books] can be both, they can be visually stunning, but they can also be mentally stimulating. They\u2019re not mutually exclusive.\u201d",

      "body": "<h2> Top story: Johnson refuses to retract Jo Cox comments</h2> \n<p>Good morning and welcome to the final briefing of the week, with Alison Rourke.</p> \n<p>Church of England bishops say the tone of the Brexit debate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/27/c-of-e-bishops-call-for-amelioration-of-brexit-rhetoric\">has become unacceptable</a>, as the PM continues to face intense criticism over his Commons performance. In a joint statement released today, they call for people inside and outside parliament to treat each other with greater respect, and it is \u201ceasy to descend into division and abuse\u201d. They also offer thinly veiled criticism of the prime minister\u2019s insistence that the supreme court was mistaken about proroguing parliament. \u201cWe call on politicians to adhere rigorously to the rule of law and on all to respect and uphold the impartiality of the courts and our judiciary,\u201d they say. It follows a host of MPs <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/26/man-arrested-outside-office-of-labour-mp-jess-phillips\">speaking out about receiving threats</a> and after Dominic Cummings suggested that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/26/dominic-cummings-delivering-brexit-only-way-to-solve-abuse-of-mps\">only carrying out Brexit would calm the tensions</a>. Boris Johnson has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/26/johnson-refuses-to-say-sorry-for-remarks-about-murdered-mp-jo-cox\">vowed to carry on referring to the Benn law </a>against no-deal Brexit as the \u201csurrender bill\u201d. He also declined to retract his comments that the best way to honour Jo Cox was to get Brexit done. \u201cThe death of Jo Cox was an absolute tragedy which I think bought the House of Commons together in unison. But it\u2019s also important to protect the right of MPs to speak freely in the House of Commons about important political matters and the fact of the so-called Benn Act is that it surrenders our powers.\u201d Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/27/ministers-still-do-not-know-nhs-cope-no-deal-brexit-report\">Whitehall\u2019s spending watchdog says ministers still don\u2019t know</a> whether there are enough medicines, medical supplies or freight capacity to support the NHS if the UK leaves the EU without a deal on Halloween.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"1fe5c03e-f7f9-4f77-b3f3-66e31385e11d\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BT38YTCHZKk?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>\u2018This is a cover-up\u2019</strong> \u2013 Donald Trump has upped the ante in the Ukraine memo scandal, by likening the sources who gave the whistleblower the details of his now-infamous phone call to Ukraine\u2019s leader to spies. \u201cYou know what we used to do in the old days, when we were smart, right? The spies and treason? We used to handle it a little differently than we do now,\u201d Trump said. His comments came <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/26/slug-trump-ukraine-latest-whistleblower-complaint-2020-election\">amid claims by the whistleblower</a> that the White House intervened to \u201clock down\u201d the transcript of the call, \u201cespecially the official word-for-word transcript of the call that was produced as is customary by the White House Situation Room\u201d. Officials were directed by White House lawyers to remove the transcript from the computer system where \u201csuch transcripts are typically stored\u201d the whistleblower said, and instead it was stored in a separate system used to handle classified information. According to the whistleblower, \u201cthis set of actions underscored to me that White House officials understood the gravity of what had transpired in the call.\u201d The Democratic House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, criticised the White House for trying to keep the transcript secret: \u201cThis is a cover-up\u201d.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Police vetting </strong>\u2013 Forces are failing to deal with predatory officers among their ranks who target vulnerable victims of crime, witnesses and suspects, for sex. A report by HM Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire &amp; Rescue Services h<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/sep/27/police-forces-failing-to-deal-with-predatory-officers-inspectors-say\">as revealed around 35,000 of the workforce have not been properly vetted</a>. At West Midlands police, 52% of staff and officers were not vetted. For the Metropolitan police, the figure was 37% and 42% at Thames Valley police. Five forces \u2013 Devon and Cornwall, Hertfordshire, Northamptonshire, Nottinghamshire and West Yorkshire \u2013 were unable to provide inspectors any information about vetting. Meanwhile, Cleveland police has become the first force to be branded \u201cfailing\u201d in all areas by inspectors and will be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/sep/27/cleveland-police-branded-failing-in-all-areas-by-inspectors\">forced to take on special measures</a>, which means the chief constable and police and crime commissioner will be called before a national board and questioned about their plans to ensure \u201ccritical improvements\u201d are made.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Stena Impero</strong> \u2013 There are reports that the UK-flagged oil tanker detained by Iran <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/27/uk-flagged-tanker-seized-by-iran-in-july-released-leaves-bandar-abbas-port\">in the Strait of Hormuz </a>has exited the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas. The tanker was detained by the Revolutionary Guards in July for alleged marine violations two weeks after Britain seized an Iranian tanker off the territory of Gibraltar. It comes as the EU has privately warned Iran that it will be<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/27/eu-may-be-forced-to-withdraw-from-nuclear-deal-iran-told\"> forced to start withdrawing from the 2015 nuclear deal</a> if Tehran carries out threats to take new steps away from its commitments. The warning makes it clear the agreement is on life support as Tehran has said it will take further action in November if the US does not lift economic sanctions. Iran has already breached three of its commitments in the agreement, including on increasing its low-enriched uranium stockpile above agreed limits. The EU has refused for 16 months to join the US in pulling out of the deal, but tensions have escalated since the drone attack on Saudi oil facilities.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Nursing shortage </strong>\u2013 In a major U-turn, ministers are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/sep/26/u-turn-as-ministers-reconsider-financial-aid-for-student-nurses\">reconsidering financial aid</a> for student nurses to help tackle the worsening shortage. The shortage in England\u2019s health service has spiralled to 40,000 vacancies since George Osborne abolished bursaries and replaced them with student loans in 2015. Assistance could include cost of living grants of \u00a33,000 to \u00a35,000.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Welsh wording </strong>\u2013 Cardiff council has backed a plan to give new streets in the city<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/sep/27/cardiff-council-backs-plan-to-give-new-streets-welsh-names\"> Welsh-only names</a>. The council will also make sure existing signs on city centre streets will be in Welsh and English when they are upgraded. The policy, due to be put before the full council for final approval next month, says new streets should be given a Welsh name \u201cconsistent with the local heritage and history of the area\u201d. The number of Welsh speakers in the capital has more than doubled in 40 years.</p> \n<p><strong>Babies on a plane</strong> \u2013 Japan Airlines unveiled an online booking tool that indicates <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/27/babies-on-a-plane-japan-airlines-unveils-tool-to-tackle-horror-of-screaming-infants\">where infants and toddlers will be seated</a>. When passengers with children aged between eight days and two years old reserve their seat, a child icon automatically appears on the seat plan, alerting other passengers who have yet to select their seats. The airline said the feature does not guarantee that passengers will be out of earshot of crying infants and will not appear if a flight is booked through a third party or part of a tour group. It attracted praise on social media including from one businessmen who suggested it \u201creally ought to be mandatory across the board.\u201d</p> \n<h2>Today in Focus podcast: Prince Andrew\u2019s damaged reputation</h2> \n<p>Last week Jeffrey Epstein accuser Virginia Roberts did her first television interview, and in it restated claims that she had been made to have sex with Prince Andrew when she was 17.

One study found that six times more young people in England (aged four to 24) have psychological problems today than a generation ago, in 1995.

      "bodyText": "Top story: Johnson refuses to retract Jo Cox comments Good morning and welcome to the final briefing of the week, with Alison Rourke. Church of England bishops say the tone of the Brexit debate has become unacceptable, as the PM continues to face intense criticism over his Commons performance. In a joint statement released today, they call for people inside and outside parliament to treat each other with greater respect, and it is \u201ceasy to descend into division and abuse\u201d. They also offer thinly veiled criticism of the prime minister\u2019s insistence that the supreme court was mistaken about proroguing parliament. \u201cWe call on politicians to adhere rigorously to the rule of law and on all to respect and uphold the impartiality of the courts and our judiciary,\u201d they say. It follows a host of MPs speaking out about receiving threats and after Dominic Cummings suggested that only carrying out Brexit would calm the tensions. Boris Johnson has vowed to carry on referring to the Benn law against no-deal Brexit as the \u201csurrender bill\u201d. He also declined to retract his comments that the best way to honour Jo Cox was to get Brexit done. \u201cThe death of Jo Cox was an absolute tragedy which I think bought the House of Commons together in unison. But it\u2019s also important to protect the right of MPs to speak freely in the House of Commons about important political matters and the fact of the so-called Benn Act is that it surrenders our powers.\u201d Meanwhile, Whitehall\u2019s spending watchdog says ministers still don\u2019t know whether there are enough medicines, medical supplies or freight capacity to support the NHS if the UK leaves the EU without a deal on Halloween. * * * \u2018This is a cover-up\u2019 \u2013 Donald Trump has upped the ante in the Ukraine memo scandal, by likening the sources who gave the whistleblower the details of his now-infamous phone call to Ukraine\u2019s leader to spies. \u201cYou know what we used to do in the old days, when we were smart, right? The spies and treason? We used to handle it a little differently than we do now,\u201d Trump said. His comments came amid claims by the whistleblower that the White House intervened to \u201clock down\u201d the transcript of the call, \u201cespecially the official word-for-word transcript of the call that was produced as is customary by the White House Situation Room\u201d. Officials were directed by White House lawyers to remove the transcript from the computer system where \u201csuch transcripts are typically stored\u201d the whistleblower said, and instead it was stored in a separate system used to handle classified information. According to the whistleblower, \u201cthis set of actions underscored to me that White House officials understood the gravity of what had transpired in the call.\u201d The Democratic House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, criticised the White House for trying to keep the transcript secret: \u201cThis is a cover-up\u201d. * * * Police vetting \u2013 Forces are failing to deal with predatory officers among their ranks who target vulnerable victims of crime, witnesses and suspects, for sex. A report by HM Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire &amp; Rescue Services has revealed around 35,000 of the workforce have not been properly vetted. At West Midlands police, 52% of staff and officers were not vetted. For the Metropolitan police, the figure was 37% and 42% at Thames Valley police. Five forces \u2013 Devon and Cornwall, Hertfordshire, Northamptonshire, Nottinghamshire and West Yorkshire \u2013 were unable to provide inspectors any information about vetting. Meanwhile, Cleveland police has become the first force to be branded \u201cfailing\u201d in all areas by inspectors and will be forced to take on special measures, which means the chief constable and police and crime commissioner will be called before a national board and questioned about their plans to ensure \u201ccritical improvements\u201d are made. * * * Stena Impero \u2013 There are reports that the UK-flagged oil tanker detained by Iran in the Strait of Hormuz has exited the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas. The tanker was detained by the Revolutionary Guards in July for alleged marine violations two weeks after Britain seized an Iranian tanker off the territory of Gibraltar. It comes as the EU has privately warned Iran that it will be forced to start withdrawing from the 2015 nuclear deal if Tehran carries out threats to take new steps away from its commitments. The warning makes it clear the agreement is on life support as Tehran has said it will take further action in November if the US does not lift economic sanctions. Iran has already breached three of its commitments in the agreement, including on increasing its low-enriched uranium stockpile above agreed limits. The EU has refused for 16 months to join the US in pulling out of the deal, but tensions have escalated since the drone attack on Saudi oil facilities. * * * Nursing shortage \u2013 In a major U-turn, ministers are reconsidering financial aid for student nurses to help tackle the worsening shortage. The shortage in England\u2019s health service has spiralled to 40,000 vacancies since George Osborne abolished bursaries and replaced them with student loans in 2015. Assistance could include cost of living grants of \u00a33,000 to \u00a35,000. * * * Welsh wording \u2013 Cardiff council has backed a plan to give new streets in the city Welsh-only names. The council will also make sure existing signs on city centre streets will be in Welsh and English when they are upgraded. The policy, due to be put before the full council for final approval next month, says new streets should be given a Welsh name \u201cconsistent with the local heritage and history of the area\u201d. The number of Welsh speakers in the capital has more than doubled in 40 years. Babies on a plane \u2013 Japan Airlines unveiled an online booking tool that indicates where infants and toddlers will be seated. When passengers with children aged between eight days and two years old reserve their seat, a child icon automatically appears on the seat plan, alerting other passengers who have yet to select their seats. The airline said the feature does not guarantee that passengers will be out of earshot of crying infants and will not appear if a flight is booked through a third party or part of a tour group. It attracted praise on social media including from one businessmen who suggested it \u201creally ought to be mandatory across the board.\u201d Today in Focus podcast: Prince Andrew\u2019s damaged reputation Last week Jeffrey Epstein accuser Virginia Roberts did her first television interview, and in it restated claims that she had been made to have sex with Prince Andrew when she was 17. Royal correspondent Chris Ship discusses the Duke of York\u2019s friendship with deceased paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. And: Labour MP Paula Sherriff on standing up to prime minister Boris Johnson. Lunchtime read: Inside the student mental health crisis A surge in anxiety, mental breakdowns, depression and stress is sweeping British university campuses. \u201cAbove all, a growing proportion just seem terrified of failure, and experience the whole process of learning and assessment as an unforgiving ordeal that offers no room for creativity or mistakes,\u201d says William Davies, lecturer at Goldsmiths and author of The Happiness Industry, a book about the commercialisation of wellbeing. One study found that six times more young people in England (aged four to 24) have psychological problems today than a generation ago, in 1995. Samira Shackle looks at the complex issues campuses are facing and the strategies universities are using to help and support their students. Sport England were caught up in the high-tackle storm that has engulfed the Rugby World Cup with Owen Farrell lucky to avoid serious injury after a sickening blow to the head against the USA and Piers Francis facing a possible ban. As was entirely apt for this summer of summers, Essex clinched the County Championship not with a damp whimper but in a heart-stopping afternoon at Taunton. The IAAF is discreetly moving away from using the term \u201cfastest loser\u201d on the eve of the world championships after complaints that the phrase might devalue athletes\u2019 achievements. Fiorentina made Arsenal\u2019s cruise into the last 16 of the Champions League a little more uncomfortable than they would have liked but a Kim Little penalty and a Vivianne Miedema goal either side of the break ensured a 2-0 win in north London. It is almost a year to the day since Salford secured survival on the final day of the Super League season: now they are just one win away from a first appearance in the Grand Final having beaten Castleford. Andy Murray produced another encouraging performance before being outlasted 4-6, 6-2, 6-4 by Australia\u2019s Alex de Minaur in two hours and 42 minutes in the second round of the Zhuhai Championships in China. And organisers of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar are close to a deal that would lead to alcohol being subsidised and more readily available during the tournament. Business Britain has its highest level of empty shops in five years as stores are hit by rising costs and low consumer confidence. Nearly 12% of shopping locations were empty in the first half of 2019, up 0.6% compared with the same period last year, according to research from Local Data Company\u2019s review of 3,000 retail centres. Major chains have shrunk dramatically, with 3,508 fewer sites operating compared with a year ago after a fall of 2,848 in the first half of 2018, with Toys R Us, Poundworld and Maplin going bust and retailers such as New Look, Carpetright and Mothercare undergoing restructures. The pound is buying \u20ac1.129 and $1.233. The papers Most of the front pages lead on news of Boris Johnson\u2019s determination to continue using \u201csurrender\u201d language in the Brexit debate, or claims from the US whistleblower about Trump\u2019s call with Ukraine. The Express says: \u201cBoris: I won\u2019t surrender no deal threat\u201d, the i reports on comments by Rachel Johnson: \u201cJohnson\u2019s sister joins criticism of \u2018bully\u2019 PM\u201d, the Times quotes a senior cabinet minister in its headline: \u201c\u2018Deliver Brexit or face riots\u2019\u201d, and the Telegraph has: \u201cCummings: What do MPs expect?\u201d with the prime minster\u2019s adviser saying it wasn\u2019t surprising some people were angry about the Brexit delay. The FT\u2019s lead is: \u201cWhite House covered up Trump\u2019s Ukraine call, says whistleblower\u201d and the Guardian has: \u201cWhite House accused of cover-up over Trump call\u201d. The Mail\u2019s splash is a report that: \u201cBank scammers steal \u00a31m a day\u201d, the Sun has news that Strictly\u2019s Shirley Ballas is having her implants removed over cancer fears: \u201cI\u2019m having breast op on Tuesday, back in Strictly by Saturday\u201d and the Mirror has a story of drink-driving charges against Derby Country football players: \u201cFootie stars drink shame\u201d.

Moves by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to heap pressure on the banks come even as the political pendulum has slammed back in the finance industry\u2019s favour, with the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, joining a chorus of government backbenchers in attacking regulators for pursuing the industry. In his final report in February, banking royal commissioner Kenneth Hayne said the banking code, which is controlled by the Australian Banking Association, needed to be changed to protect vulnerable customers and farmers who default on loans due to drought. The new code requires approval from the ACCC, which accepts the ABA\u2019s proposals do enough to help farmers but wants stronger consumer protections. The ACCC deputy chair, Delia Rickard, said the regulator wanted to impose a prohibition on charging steep interest rates on basic accounts that fall into overdraft and for banks to do more to track down existing customers who are eligible for a no-frills, low-fee basic account. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen interest rates of 19%, and that just undermines the spirit of the royal commission,\u201d she told Guardian Australia. She said the ACCC also wanted the 10 banks that currently offer basic banking products to commit to continue doing so. \u201cIf they were to stop offering it, then those public benefits would diminish, or would disappear altogether, depending on how many stopped,\u201d she said. She declined to comment on a political climate in Canberra that has become increasingly torrid for regulators striving to implement the Hayne commission\u2019s recommendations. Sister agency the Australian Securities and Investments Commission faced a barrage of hostile questioning from MPs at a parliamentary hearing this month over its decision to appeal the \u201cwagyu and shiraz\u201d responsible lending case it lost against Westpac. And on Thursday Josh Frydenberg added his voice to the backlash against the regulators, telling a financial tabloid\u2019s property conference a too-stringent application of responsible lending rules could hurt \u201chard-working families\u201d. In May, he watered down a Hayne recommendation to ban trailing commissions on mortgages. \u201cThe government\u2019s put out a timetable for implementing the recommendations, they have accepted them all, and our hope is that they all go through,\u201d Rickard said. \u201cWe need people to have trust in banks and they need to earn it, so I think change does need to happen.\u201d The ABA has until 14 October to respond to the ACCC\u2019s proposed new conditions.

A classic American number about driving down an LA boulevard, though an obscure one, Sepulveda, which sounds a lot like sepulchre. It closes, as no musical has ever done, with a jazzhands-in-the-air show tune about the Final Solution, called Joyocaust. A Jewish Make \u2019Em Laugh about taking \u201cthe concentration out of the camps\u201d to concentrate \u201con some song and dance\u201d that does precisely what this glorious, game-changing show has always done best: make \u2019em laugh, cry, cringe and think, all at the same time. Here is the Transparent: Musicale Finale (Amazon Prime) you dreamed of \u2013 heavy-going, light as a feather, uproarious and unbearably sad. Even its flaws are perfect. Thank. Non-binary. God. The stakes were nosebleed high. Fans grieved for the show and its family, both real and created, when it emerged last year that Jeffrey Tambor had been accused of sexual harassment by a cast member and former assistant. The tangle of reality and art, of what happens on and off set, has always been fundamental to the genius and integrity of Transparent. It is, after all, a show made by the child of a trans parent. A child, Jill Soloway, who transitioned during the making of it and now identifies as non-binary. This stuff always matters, but in Transparent it really mattered. Soloway\u2019s practical solution was to fire Tambor, who continues to deny the allegations. Creatively, the solution was mischievous and entirely on song. Kill Maura off.

And it explains why, when institutional politics finally caught up with the turmoil below and our electoral landscape began erupting, so many political experts were confounded. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I fully understand politics right now,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/23/tony-blair-bernie-sanders-jeremy-corbyn\" title=\"\">observed Tony Blair</a> in 2016.</p> \n<p>It explains, too, why, for all the noise and breathless 24/7 news coverage currently emanating from parliament and Downing Street, viewers and readers rarely come away with a clearer idea of how we got here, or where we might be going next. Many have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/sep/06/bbc-parliament-the-ratings-hit-thats-big-brother-meets-24-with-added-bercow\" title=\"\">glued to coverage</a> of the government\u2019s legal imbroglio and the factional machinations around it, but analysis of what precipitated all this is usually limited to a recap of the previous moves in a high-level chess game. There is little mention of new forms of political mobilisation that are being forged from the crisis, emerging from material demands that our extant political structures seem unable to meet.</p> \n<p>In recent years I\u2019ve been <a href=\"http://www.jackshenker.net/special-features/now-we-have-your-attention-new-book-out-in-september-2019.html\" title=\"\">travelling all over the country</a> listening to the stories of those who, a long way from Westminster, are reanimating politics in remarkable ways: from teenagers holding their own radical, grassroots <a href=\"https://www.demandtheimpossible.org.uk/\" title=\"\">education courses</a>, to <a href=\"https://londonrentersunion.org/\" title=\"\">new unions of private renters</a> taking on landlords, and <a href=\"https://www.uvwunion.org.uk/\" title=\"\">insurgent labour movements</a> led by those on the frontline of low-pay Britain. As Layla, a young woman in Manchester, described these eruptions to me: \u201cAll these experts say that people are \u2018anti-politics\u2019 right now, but what we\u2019re seeing is the epitome of politics.\u201d She is one of many for whom a traditional path \u2013 from university to a secure job and eventually a home of one\u2019s own \u2013 has warped, and who is determined to fight against the cancellation of her future.</p> \n<p>But narratives such as Layla\u2019s get drowned out by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/26/boris-johnson-brutish-parliamentary-performance-democratic-dignity-mps\" title=\"\">MPs hurling insults</a> at each other and the intrigue around special advisers. Politics is still being served up to citizens as something to be passively consumed from afar, other than during occasional set-pieces at the ballot box, rather than as an ongoing battle over what kind of country will arise from the rubble of a failed consensus.</p> \n<p>So this is an appeal to all of us who write about politics: to do a better job of linking the bedlam in one decrepit building with the upheaval everywhere else. That involves proactively seeking out stories from those situated beyond the radar of conventional media coverage, including independent media outlets, and diversifying newsrooms \u2013 not just in terms of the racial, gender and class backgrounds of personnel, but also the prevailing thinking about what is politically possible.</p> \n<p>There are concrete proposals regarding the democratisation of our media \u2013 more <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/feb/11/public-funds-should-be-used-to-rescue-local-journalism-says-report\" title=\"\">investment in local reporting</a>, for example, as well as new taxes on tech firms to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-45271286\" title=\"\">fund investigative and public interest journalism</a> \u2013 that are worthy of consideration. But they must be accompanied by a shift in the way we conceptualise politics: not as a free-floating spectacle, but rather as something grounded in time and place, capable of altering all our lives, and capable, too, of being altered.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/25/boris-johnson-brexit-supreme-court\">Johnson\u2019s plan is to turn his supreme court humiliation into rocket fuel at the polls | Martin Kettle</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>In the 1930s and 40s, legions of baseball correspondents in the American South filed dutiful articles detailing the twists and turns of their game. Hardly any of them ever commented on the fact that US baseball leagues were racially segregated, or that segregation was being progressively undermined by a nascent civil rights movement that would go on to change the country\u2019s history.

For some, the first years of post-2008 disorder \u2013 marked by austerity, riots and the steady rise of the far right \u2013 are now even celebrated as a golden age of sensible governance. That disconnect \u2013 between politics on the ground and politics as it is understood by the people who manage and interpret it \u2013 long predates the ascendancy of Jeremy Corbyn to the Labour leadership, or the divisions over Brexit, or Boris Johnson\u2019s shambolic authoritarian populism. And it explains why, when institutional politics finally caught up with the turmoil below and our electoral landscape began erupting, so many political experts were confounded. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I fully understand politics right now,\u201d observed Tony Blair in 2016. It explains, too, why, for all the noise and breathless 24/7 news coverage currently emanating from parliament and Downing Street, viewers and readers rarely come away with a clearer idea of how we got here, or where we might be going next. Many have been glued to coverage of the government\u2019s legal imbroglio and the factional machinations around it, but analysis of what precipitated all this is usually limited to a recap of the previous moves in a high-level chess game. There is little mention of new forms of political mobilisation that are being forged from the crisis, emerging from material demands that our extant political structures seem unable to meet. In recent years I\u2019ve been travelling all over the country listening to the stories of those who, a long way from Westminster, are reanimating politics in remarkable ways: from teenagers holding their own radical, grassroots education courses, to new unions of private renters taking on landlords, and insurgent labour movements led by those on the frontline of low-pay Britain. As Layla, a young woman in Manchester, described these eruptions to me: \u201cAll these experts say that people are \u2018anti-politics\u2019 right now, but what we\u2019re seeing is the epitome of politics.\u201d She is one of many for whom a traditional path \u2013 from university to a secure job and eventually a home of one\u2019s own \u2013 has warped, and who is determined to fight against the cancellation of her future. But narratives such as Layla\u2019s get drowned out by MPs hurling insults at each other and the intrigue around special advisers. Politics is still being served up to citizens as something to be passively consumed from afar, other than during occasional set-pieces at the ballot box, rather than as an ongoing battle over what kind of country will arise from the rubble of a failed consensus. So this is an appeal to all of us who write about politics: to do a better job of linking the bedlam in one decrepit building with the upheaval everywhere else. That involves proactively seeking out stories from those situated beyond the radar of conventional media coverage, including independent media outlets, and diversifying newsrooms \u2013 not just in terms of the racial, gender and class backgrounds of personnel, but also the prevailing thinking about what is politically possible. There are concrete proposals regarding the democratisation of our media \u2013 more investment in local reporting, for example, as well as new taxes on tech firms to fund investigative and public interest journalism \u2013 that are worthy of consideration. But they must be accompanied by a shift in the way we conceptualise politics: not as a free-floating spectacle, but rather as something grounded in time and place, capable of altering all our lives, and capable, too, of being altered. In the 1930s and 40s, legions of baseball correspondents in the American South filed dutiful articles detailing the twists and turns of their game. Hardly any of them ever commented on the fact that US baseball leagues were racially segregated, or that segregation was being progressively undermined by a nascent civil rights movement that would go on to change the country\u2019s history. They operated within the system they reported on, and rarely questioned its underlying structure or the wider social forces that were rendering it an anachronism. A similar category error has characterised British political journalism in recent years, and our current troubles are \u2013 at least in part \u2013 a consequence of it. If we are to overcome them, that mistake needs to be addressed; at the moment, it is just being repeated. \u2022 Jack Shenker is a writer based in London and Cairo.

      "bodyText": "John Simm doesn\u2019t do any of that superstition nonsense. It\u2019s not the Scottish Play \u2013 he\u2019s in Macbeth, and he\u2019s going to shout it from the theatre rooftop. Actually, we are in the cafe of the theatre \u2013 the Chichester Festival theatre \u2013 outside on the terrace in the late summer sunshine, drinking cappuccinos. Almond milk for Simm, he doesn\u2019t do dairy. Is that a fashion thing? \u201cNo, it\u2019s because it\u2019s weird if you think about it. Why drink bovine breast milk? We don\u2019t even drink human breast milk. It\u2019s not for us, it\u2019s for baby cows.\u201d Hmmm, my bovine breast milk froth is suddenly looking less appealing. He\u2019s not veggie though. \u201cI go through periods. It started when we filmed an episode of Life on Mars in an abattoir. That turned my stomach for quite a while, the smell and the screams had a horrible effect on me, but I have to admit it didn\u2019t change me completely. I\u2019m in and out.\u201d He\u2019s happy enough \u2013 well, with a fair few doubts to be fair \u2013 to stick his own dagger into human flesh. The king\u2019s. Macbeth, that\u2019s why we\u2019re here. This one is directed by Paul Miller, who did Hamlet with Simm at the Crucible in Sheffield nearly a decade ago. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a three-play plan,\u201d says Simm. \u201cLear next, then we\u2019re out.\u201d Lear might have to wait at least another 10 years, but now \u2013 aged 49 \u2013 is about the right time for Macbeth. And he\u2019s loving it. \u201cHe\u2019s difficult to get a handle on, such a contradiction. He\u2019s this incredible warrior that everyone talks about, looks up to and respects at the beginning. Then he goes completely to pieces when he has to kill a sleeping king. Then it gets really interesting, he gets the bloodlust, he turns into a tyrant, it\u2019s a fantastic part to play.\u201d Simm is something of a specialist at troubled and conflicted, from Raskolnikov in Tony Marchant\u2019s TV Crime and Punishment, to Sam Tyler in Life on Mars, to, more recently, the Labour MP in David Hare\u2019s Collateral. Does he dig his Macbeth from his own tortured soul, I wonder? \u201cNo! He is an absolute bloodythirsty tyrant!\u201d What about the ambition? \u201cNo! I don\u2019t see any of me, thank God, but I do think he is a fucking brilliant character, this guy who turns into an absolute monster and then is completely isolated when she dies \u2026 I don\u2019t want to ruin it for anyone who hasn\u2019t seen.\u201d Oops, spoiler alert. Presumably, he and his wife (the actor Kate Magowan) have a similar sort of relationship as Macbeth and Lady M (who is played at Chichester by Dervla Kirwan)? \u201cOnly in the fact that he worships her, and she is the glue that holds everything together.\u201d She \u2013 Lady Simm \u2013 did read the part when he was learning his lines at home, he says. No, she doesn\u2019t sleepwalk; is she ambitious though, for him? \u201cI guess so, yeah, on my behalf, and about certain injustices.\u201d And he tells me that it was her who persuaded him to keep up his public Instagram account, for the fans. See, there you go: do your Insta, now kill the monarch, that\u2019s not such a giant leap is it? There are other parallels between Macbeth and what\u2019s going on outside the theatre, aren\u2019t there? \u201cI can\u2019t think of anything specific,\u201d he laughs. \u201cI mean it\u2019s a play about power, and corruption and lies, a tyrant, political intrigue \u2026 yeah, there\u2019s a lot of relevance right now, it\u2019s a tale for the ages.\u201d He mentions a recent political cartoon by Seamus Jennings that had the prime minister drowning in excrement and pulling parliament down with him, with a modified Macbeth quote: \u201cI am in BREXIT stepped in so far that, should I wade more, returning were as tedious as go o\u2019er \u2026\u201d \u201cBut I\u2019m not going to play him like Boris Johnson, it would be a mistake,\u201d says Simm.

The FBI had arrested an army planning \u201cfull ground war\u201d on the United States. A massive jihadi battalion, trained in Miami but backed by al-Qaida, was promising to \u201ckill all the devils we can\u201d \u2013 starting with Chicago\u2019s most famous skyscraper, Sears Tower. </p> <p>That was in 2006. Two years later, Morris got a tipoff from someone involved in the trial that the case could be \u201ca bit whiffy\u201d. In fact, it was a colossal stitch-up. The bureau\u2019s biggest counterterrorism scalp of recent times was, says Morris, \u201call a huge lie, before it was called fake news. Totally manufactured nonsense.\u201d</p> <p>Six broke builders in Liberty City \u2013 the impoverished suburb of Miami where Moonlight was shot \u2013 had fallen under the sway of a local preacher. Narseal Batiste\u2019s cut-and-paste philosophy involved Haitian Catholicism, Judaism, karate \u2013 and a dash of Islam. He mouthed off but lacked the funds, foresight or any particular desire to take things further.</p> <p>So the FBI paid informants, including a convicted rapist, to pose as emissaries from al-Qaida and egg Batiste on to accept $50,000 with the promise he would spend it on guns and explosives. He never did. \u201cInstead they wanted work boots and overalls, because they were construction workers, then ceremonial swords and horses to lead a protest to the governor\u2019s house about living conditions in Liberty City.\u201d</p> <p>Morris chucks up his hands, still agog, 13 years later. \u201cTheir idea was to push Sears Tower into a lake and swamp Chicago with a tidal wave. None of which is remotely possible. They might as well have wanted to invade Washington DC on hippos.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3540bb8f7e0ed05f330dbbb26f7dba3056de4031\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3540bb8f7e0ed05f330dbbb26f7dba3056de4031/0_277_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Committed to wallop\u2019 \u2026 Morris on the set of The DayShall Come.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Committed to wallop\u2019 \u2026 Morris on the set of The Day Shall Come.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Only one of the seven had any familiarity with the tower.

I loved it. It has a wallop rare in cinema today; when you have done the immersive research, he says, \u201cyou\u2019re committed to wallop\u201d.</p> <p>The films he prizes highest \u2013 Come and See, The Battle of Algiers, Son of Saul \u2013 involve \u201cquite insane levels of commitment. False button-pushing has to be resisted as an article of faith. Resist full sentimentality! Set fire to the screen!\u201d</p> <p>But does The Day Shall Come assume too much knowledge on the part of the audience? Reaction so far seems split between those with recognition of the situation and those without. A black audience in Philadelphia, Morris reports, responded with nods. \u201c\u2018Yeah, the law is a mincing machine, they\u2019ll take advantage of any frailty you\u2019ve got.\u2019\u201d They indulged Moses and \u201claughed across an icy divide\u201d at the FBI. \u201cYou think: \u2018Oh, this actually is the firing range. We\u2019re sitting in it.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Morris\u2019s core audience, though, has exhibited a little resistance. Perhaps such people only like to be challenged so far? \u201cOh God, white liberals are terrible! They\u2019re awful! There\u2019s a sort of feeling that they\u2019ve done the due diligence on their own conscience and if somebody comes in and says something else bad about them, that person must be wrong.</p> <p>\u201cOf course, I\u2019m talking about my friends here. It\u2019s a sort of privileged position whereby your conscience is allowed to operate in a particular way, without fracturing your worldview. Then they go and have a bracing latte.\u201d</p> <p>Morris has the flippant strictness of someone who has done his homework and is unsurprised you haven\u2019t. He didn\u2019t feel awkward being a white man telling a black man\u2019s story, he says, \u201cbecause I felt the story had rather rudely impinged itself on me. It was a colour blind inquiry; I was trying to hunt down a lie. And I ended up looking at a system where mainly white people are manipulating mainly black and brown people. That\u2019s the way the gradient is shaped. And people were extremely welcoming, despite my sort of alien appearance.\u201d</p> <p>He says that he never considered making a documentary, much as he delights and despairs in the zany details of the real-life cases: the FBI informant sent to infiltrate a Californian mosque who so overdid it, the mosque reported him to the FBI; the fake imam the bureau devised to try and radicalise a Chicago carjacker whose own imam denounced violence. \u201cThey made up their own ideological godfather!\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0b484b352664724e0a3b48bd5159f2fc710e1441\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0b484b352664724e0a3b48bd5159f2fc710e1441/15_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Betraying citizens\u2019 \u2026 a scene from The Day Shall Come.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Betraying citizens\u2019 \u2026 a scene from The Day Shall Come.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Publicity Image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>No wonder people often laugh when they are being arrested. \u201cIt\u2019s so strongly against their sense of reality. They\u2019ve been living in a Truman Show existence, and then they\u2019ve bumped into the wall.\u201d</p> <p>Yet he still insisted his film be fiction. \u201cYou have to be seductive. There\u2019s a universal story at the heart of this film that\u2019s quite hard to ignore. It doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s going to work. But what can you do? You have to point things out. And if you run into a room and say: anybody who doesn\u2019t agree is a fucking idiot, you\u2019ve elected to preach to the converted.\u201d</p> <p>He swigs his coffee \u2013 black americano, not bracing latte \u2013 and gives the table a breather. \u201cBut I may be talking old-fashioned nonsense language. Because the way to persuade people might be to measure what they think, treat them like a Skinner animal: put some stimulus in their way that makes them behave differently.\u201d</p> <p>Spend two hours with Morris and you start to realise that, unlike most people in film or TV or comedy, or even journalism or politics, he is a scientist. \u2013 one who happens to like working in the humanities. Raised by two doctors, Morris studied zoology at Bristol, and has essentially been practising it ever since. His mind is as much analytical as imaginative. Institutional irrationality annoys, as do non-contextual metrics and linguistic slippage. At one point I ask if he thinks we need \u201cseismic change\u201d. He explains that the word only applies to earthquakes and volcanoes, so he would have to be \u201ca certain kind of extreme water to suggest that\u2019s what we need\u201d. </p> <p>Such keen observational skills might also explain the sometimes messianic impression he leaves. It\u2019s a bit misleading: Morris is perfectly nice and kind and calm as he completely wipes the floor with you.</p> <p>It was during his time at Bristol that he was introduced to operant conditioning, the system pioneered by the American behavioural psychologist BF Skinner, who stuck rats and hermit crabs in (separate) boxes, exposed them to variant forces and recorded their reactions. Morris has de facto been doing this to us for decades. Think what we can still learn from, say, the celebrities who appeared on Brass Eye\u2019s drugs episode and <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0330093/\" title=\"\">Paedogeddon!</a> special, from the media fallout and the reaction of others to what has or has not happened since to reporting, witch-hunting and moral panic.</p> <p>Actual human-sized Skinner machines are around already, Morris thinks. We\u2019re just kidding ourselves that we\u2019re not trapped in them. The other day, an AA man showed Morris the snazzy monitoring kit in his van, which even recorded how long before a junction he indicated. \u201cI said: \u2018Isn\u2019t that creepy?\u2019 He said: \u2018Not really. My daughter\u2019s just passed her driving test and I\u2019ve got half-price insurance for her. And all I have to do is install a black box recorder in the car and a camera on the dashboard that measures exactly how she drives and the character of her facial movements. As long as she stays within the parameters set by the insurance company, her premium stays low.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a2c39c26ce9d99ad7d4fbea73e8068f1f780cd80\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a2c39c26ce9d99ad7d4fbea73e8068f1f780cd80/0_17_1536_922/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Four Lions.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Four Lions (2010).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Publicity image from film company</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Soon, such tech will run in real time, thinks Morris. \u201cSo any change in her facial alignments will be picked up and a friendly warning on the dashboard will say: \u2018You\u2019re looking a bit tired, there\u2019s a Costa three miles on the right. If you pop in, your insurance level stays low.</p> <p>\u201cSuddenly, you\u2019ve got a Skinner machine that will nudge you in the direction that it wants you to behave. And we just happily ignore it! Or think it\u2019s amusing. The problem with Black Mirror is it\u2019s set in the future. But this isn\u2019t a paranoid future nightmare. It\u2019s just casually what\u2019s happening in the name of being helpful.\u201d</p> <p>Morris uses a 2G phone. It\u2019s not that he\u2019s particularly worried about being bugged, as he just assumes we all are anyway. What concerns him is the casual way we \u201cvolunteer data in the interest of some convenience we don\u2019t really need, which is probably going to come back and bite you on the arse much harder than the FBI would\u201d.</p> <p>He sighs. People are beasts of instinct, not logic. The seriously poor residents of Liberty City \u2013 like those men stung by the FBI \u2013 voted Trump because \u201cpeople\u2019s sense of what should happen is very, very driven by exactly where they are, and what they think about the status quo. We may look upon it as rash or self-damaging, but it doesn\u2019t feel like that.\u201d Plus, if one person thinks they might have found an escape route, the rest of the tribe will cluster. \u201cWe were a bubble species long before the internet.\u201d</p> <p>Touring the world with Four Lions, says Morris, confirmed his view that \u201cevery human being is slightly racist and every nation has a different way of being racist\u201d. Australia especially so, he thinks. \u201cWhen did they repeal the White Australia Act? 1975? It\u2019s like a time-slip.\u201d America is \u201craw\u201d because of its recent slavery; Britain\u2019s racism is stranger, more complicated, but no less dismaying.</p> <p>The shirt has come off, replaced by a neon cycling jacket for the trip home. Talk turns inevitably to Brexit and Boris Johnson, on whom Morris is reluctant to pass judgment because \u2013 ever the scientist \u2013 he hasn\u2019t observed him up close. Still, he does suspect that today\u2019s leaders are \u201cgiving signals that allow people to walk out into the street and shout their worst thoughts. When, actually, you should have just kept it to yourself, mate.\u201d</p> <p>And, just in case any of those white liberals happen to be reading: this means you. \u201cYou have very, very bien pensant liberals who are just bloody racist about Muslims. People saying: \u2018Well, I think they should dress more carefully, because otherwise they\u2019ll make you feel awkward on the tube and you don\u2019t know what\u2019s under those garments and they\u2019re weird anyway.\u2019\u201d The table gets a final smack. \u201cCome on, guys! We can do better than that.\u201d</p> <p><em>The Day Shall Come opens in the US on 27 September and in the UK on 11 October. An Australian release has not yet been set.</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Chris Morris first saw the reports on Sky News. The FBI had arrested an army planning \u201cfull ground war\u201d on the United States. A massive jihadi battalion, trained in Miami but backed by al-Qaida, was promising to \u201ckill all the devils we can\u201d \u2013 starting with Chicago\u2019s most famous skyscraper, Sears Tower. That was in 2006. Two years later, Morris got a tipoff from someone involved in the trial that the case could be \u201ca bit whiffy\u201d. In fact, it was a colossal stitch-up. The bureau\u2019s biggest counterterrorism scalp of recent times was, says Morris, \u201call a huge lie, before it was called fake news. Totally manufactured nonsense.\u201d Six broke builders in Liberty City \u2013 the impoverished suburb of Miami where Moonlight was shot \u2013 had fallen under the sway of a local preacher. Narseal Batiste\u2019s cut-and-paste philosophy involved Haitian Catholicism, Judaism, karate \u2013 and a dash of Islam. He mouthed off but lacked the funds, foresight or any particular desire to take things further. So the FBI paid informants, including a convicted rapist, to pose as emissaries from al-Qaida and egg Batiste on to accept $50,000 with the promise he would spend it on guns and explosives. He never did. \u201cInstead they wanted work boots and overalls, because they were construction workers, then ceremonial swords and horses to lead a protest to the governor\u2019s house about living conditions in Liberty City.\u201d Morris chucks up his hands, still agog, 13 years later. \u201cTheir idea was to push Sears Tower into a lake and swamp Chicago with a tidal wave. None of which is remotely possible. They might as well have wanted to invade Washington DC on hippos.\u201d Only one of the seven had any familiarity with the tower. They had no weapons or contact with anyone not being bankrolled \u2013 and scripted \u2013 by the FBI. The deputy director himself admitted any plans were \u201cmore aspirational than operational\u201d. Eventually, five of them were sentenced to a total of 44 years in prison. Next month sees the release of The Day Shall Come, the movie Morris made after being inspired by the case, along with the 400 or so similar ones he has come across since 9/11. He estimates one arrest is made every three weeks of a suspect the FBI has coached into declaring terrorist intent. \u201cIt\u2019s harder to capture real terrorists than it is to manufacture your own. And as someone at the Department of Justice said to me: \u2018We\u2019re not going to stop a system unless it doesn\u2019t work.\u2019\u201d The film\u2019s hero is Moses (Marchant Davis), who runs a community farm and preaches peaceful revolution \u2013 aided by dinosaurs, summonable by trumpet \u2013 to a congregation of four, including his wife and young daughter. But a local informant (Kayvan Novak) shops him to a needy FBI agent (Anna Kendrick), eager to impress her boss (Denis O\u2019Hare), himself in need of a high-profile victory. With the aid of a fake sheikh, a literal gift horse for Moses (with whom he talks), and some empty uranium canisters, a case is constructed. Lives are at stake. More pressingly, so are promotions. Save for directing a few episodes of Veep, this is Morris\u2019s first project since 2010\u2019s Four Lions. He says that he is not concerned the films might be seen as too similar, that only the dopey would confuse the two. \u201cThey relate only in terms of the Wikipedia heading you might lazily use.

If you pop in, your insurance level stays low. \u201cSuddenly, you\u2019ve got a Skinner machine that will nudge you in the direction that it wants you to behave. And we just happily ignore it! Or think it\u2019s amusing. The problem with Black Mirror is it\u2019s set in the future. But this isn\u2019t a paranoid future nightmare. It\u2019s just casually what\u2019s happening in the name of being helpful.\u201d Morris uses a 2G phone. It\u2019s not that he\u2019s particularly worried about being bugged, as he just assumes we all are anyway. What concerns him is the casual way we \u201cvolunteer data in the interest of some convenience we don\u2019t really need, which is probably going to come back and bite you on the arse much harder than the FBI would\u201d. He sighs. People are beasts of instinct, not logic. The seriously poor residents of Liberty City \u2013 like those men stung by the FBI \u2013 voted Trump because \u201cpeople\u2019s sense of what should happen is very, very driven by exactly where they are, and what they think about the status quo. We may look upon it as rash or self-damaging, but it doesn\u2019t feel like that.\u201d Plus, if one person thinks they might have found an escape route, the rest of the tribe will cluster. \u201cWe were a bubble species long before the internet.\u201d Touring the world with Four Lions, says Morris, confirmed his view that \u201cevery human being is slightly racist and every nation has a different way of being racist\u201d. Australia especially so, he thinks. \u201cWhen did they repeal the White Australia Act? 1975? It\u2019s like a time-slip.\u201d America is \u201craw\u201d because of its recent slavery; Britain\u2019s racism is stranger, more complicated, but no less dismaying. The shirt has come off, replaced by a neon cycling jacket for the trip home. Talk turns inevitably to Brexit and Boris Johnson, on whom Morris is reluctant to pass judgment because \u2013 ever the scientist \u2013 he hasn\u2019t observed him up close. Still, he does suspect that today\u2019s leaders are \u201cgiving signals that allow people to walk out into the street and shout their worst thoughts. When, actually, you should have just kept it to yourself, mate.\u201d And, just in case any of those white liberals happen to be reading: this means you. \u201cYou have very, very bien pensant liberals who are just bloody racist about Muslims. People saying: \u2018Well, I think they should dress more carefully, because otherwise they\u2019ll make you feel awkward on the tube and you don\u2019t know what\u2019s under those garments and they\u2019re weird anyway.\u2019\u201d The table gets a final smack. \u201cCome on, guys! We can do better than that.\u201d The Day Shall Come opens in the US on 27 September and in the UK on 11 October. An Australian release has not yet been set.",

Cardiff council\u2019s cabinet is hoping the move will eventually mean there are as many Welsh street names as English ones in the city and bolster the language. The council will also make sure existing signs on city centre streets will be in Welsh and English when they are upgraded. However, existing street names in residential communities and suburbs of Cardiff will retain their current names. Cardiff is not regarded as a traditional stronghold for the language, but the number of Welsh speakers in the capital has more than doubled over the past 40 years. There are 17 primary schools and three secondary schools in the city educating 8,500 pupils in Welsh. The policy, due to be put before the full council for final approval next month, says new streets should be given a Welsh name \u201cconsistent with the local heritage and history of the area\u201d. It says the names of specific individuals may be used where there is a historical or legacy link.

      "body": "<p>On paper, Legends looked like a box-office hit. Adam Joiner billed his movie as an anachronistic mash-up of legendary 19th-century American figures, a steampunk Avengers<em> </em>\u2013 tailor-made to satiate the ever-expanding appetite for big-ticket, fantasy-action pictures.</p> <p>With Endgame, the latest Avengers installment, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/apr/28/avengers-endgame-breaks-global-box-office-record-in-opening-weekend\">grossing more than $1.2bn</a> in its opening weekend, it isn\u2019t hard to understand how Joiner was able to secure a relatively measly $14m in investment for the project.</p> <p>The only problem? Beyond its screenplay, Legends<em> </em>didn\u2019t exist \u2013 and it never would.</p> <p>Joiner, 41, was arrested on 27 August and was charged in a Los Angeles federal court with wire fraud, money laundering and aggravated identity theft. Prosecutors allege he orchestrated an elaborate scheme of fraud, convincing at least two foreign firms to invest millions in Legends. Through email and telephone communications, and a series of forged documents, federal prosecutors say, he claimed to have executed distribution agreements with companies like Netflix and Amblin Partners, Steven Spielberg\u2019s production outfit.</p> <p>In reality, no such agreements were made, the prosecutors charge, and Joiner did very little with the ill-gotten funds to produce a film. \u201cHe spent much of the money on himself,\u201d including on the purchase of a $5m home in Manhattan Beach, California, the FBI special agent Nathan Cherney wrote in an affidavit to the criminal complaint.</p> <p>Sweeping epics in the style of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/01/the-new-nerds-how-avengers-and-game-of-thrones-made-everyone-geek-out\">Game of Thrones</a> or the recently Disney-fied Star Wars universe have inspired an undeniable gold rush for premium content \u2013 so much so that the genre has, in some ways, come to define the contemporary economics of the film industry.</p> <p>The success of Marvel, the comic publisher turned studio juggernaut, has been particularly game-changing, building the concept of epic \u201cfilm universes\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIts success inspired a slew of other franchises to pursue film-verses,\u201d the media reporter Ashley Rodriguez <a href=\"https://qz.com/1116592/marvel-conquers-hollywood-nine-years-17-movies-12-billion-so-far/\">wrote for Quartz</a> in 2017. \u201cLucasfilm, also owned by Disney, borrowed the model for<em> </em>Star Wars, which studio boss Kathleen Kennedy hopes to carry on for another decade. Hasbro is rolling out its Transformers and GI Joe franchises into a broader movie-verse, based on its popular children\u2019s toys.

Paul Huh, a director with Korean Investment Partners Co, Ltd (KIP), told the FBI he met Adam Joiner in late 2015 through John Yi, a Korean associate. Joiner hailed from Granite Bay, California, a small town of just over 20,000 in the Sacramento area. He described himself as the owner of a film production company called Dark Planet Pictures, LLC, the affidavit says, and claimed to be seeking investment to produce a screenplay written by his brother, Andrew.</p> <p>Adam had registered Dark Planet with the California secretary of state\u2019s office in 2014, and although the company\u2019s registration is currently inactive, he and his brother are listed as one-time officers. (Andrew Joiner has not been named in the case against Adam.)</p> <p>Joiner came to the table with what he claimed was a pre-existing relationship with Netflix, Huh told the FBI. \u201cThings have begun to pick up steam with Netflix as a potential distributor of the film,\u201d Joiner wrote in a February 2016 email to Huh that is referenced in the affidavit. \u201cI have another meeting with them this week,\u201d he added.</p> <p>\u201cOn Netflix, I have another good meeting with them yesterday, and expect to receive a contract from them by the end of the week,\u201d Joiner allegedly wrote three days later.</p> <p>Before KIP would agree to invest in Legends, Huh wanted to see a copy of the Netflix deal. He told investigators he received a fax bearing a Netflix-branded cover sheet two days later. It included a letter, dated 5 April 2016, purporting to \u201cconfirm that an agreement between Netflix, Inc and Dark Planet Pictures, LLC, was executed March 31st 2016\u201d. The letter was allegedly signed by an individual titled \u201cVice President, Business &amp; Legal Affairs/Content Acquisition\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f0c06de2cb9a6e6d5300f558cc84c825dff33ab9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f0c06de2cb9a6e6d5300f558cc84c825dff33ab9/225_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Avengers: Endgame grossed more than $1.2bn in its opening weekend.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Avengers: Endgame grossed more than $1.2bn in its opening weekend.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That same day, according to the affidavit, Joiner forwarded an email that purported to come from said executive, and used an email address affixed to a Netflix domain. Attached was what the FBI alleges to be a fabricated distribution agreement between Netflix and Dark Planet. The agreement was reportedly signed by Joiner on behalf of Dark Planet, and by an individual titled \u201cChief Content Officer\u201d on behalf of Netflix.</p> <p>The affidavit says Joiner then forwarded an email from a third executive on 8 April, 2016, which read: \u201cLook forward to making this movie!\u201d</p> <p>Huh was convinced. Through one of its subsidiary investment funds, KIP wired $4m (half of the agreed-upon $8m) into a Bank of America account in the name of \u201cLegends Film Co, LLC\u201d.</p> <p>FBI interviews with the aforementioned executives (all identities were redacted in the affidavit) revealed the agreement and associated communiqu\u00e9s had been falsified. The executives said they weren\u2019t familiar with Joiner, Dark Planet, or Legends; and two of the executives were no longer Netflix employees (one had only ever been a contractor to begin with). They denied the signatures on the agreement were theirs.</p> <p>The following month, acting on behalf of Dark Planet, Joiner allegedly entered into another investment agreement, this time with two Chinese firms: Star Century Pictures Co, Ltd, and one of its affiliates, PGA Yungpark Capital, Ltd. That agreement referenced a supposed commitment by Netflix to acquire the distribution rights to Legends, which was cited in the contract as \u201ca material basis for [Star Century\u2019s] decision to invest\u201d, according to the affidavit.</p> <p>Attached to the agreement was the same fabricated distribution agreement that Joiner is alleged to have provided KIP, with the forged signature of one of the purported Netflix executives. On 3 June 2016, Yungpark wired $6m into the Legends<em> </em>bank account.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\" data-alt=\"break\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\">break</a> </figure>  <p>With roughly $10m in hand, Joiner\u2019s alleged machinations progressed.</p> <p>On 29 June 2016, according to the affidavit, he wrote in an email to Paul Huh: \u201c[W]e are expecting to secure Don Murphy by this Friday to be our \u2018name\u2019 Producer for the film.\u201d Murphy is perhaps most famous for producing the high-budget, CGI-heavy Transformers trilogy. In the email, Joiner claimed Murphy had proposed bringing in the director Michael Bay, who also directed the Transformers films, as well as other battle-scene-packed pictures such as Armageddon and Pearl Harbor.</p> <p>In a later email to Huh and Star Century executive Ma Xue, Joiner allegedly wrote: \u201cWe agreed to terms verbally yesterday with Guillermo del Toro and his agent.\u201d Del Toro is another director-darling of the fantasy and sci-fi genres, having directed two Hellboy films as well as the critically acclaimed Pan\u2019s Labyrinth.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c9ccf9da61fd76bdaf0b5cfd5b6580dfd6b8f433\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c9ccf9da61fd76bdaf0b5cfd5b6580dfd6b8f433/0_99_811_487/500.jpg\" alt=\"Guillermo del Toro.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Guillermo del Toro.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frazer Harrison/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Murphy later told the FBI he had been retained by Joiner to produce Legends \u2013 though the project had been pitched under an alternate title, Folkwar. Under the agreement, Murphy was to receive $1.2m in exchange for producing services. Half of that amount was paid to an escrow account linked to the project.</p> <p>In hiring Murphy, Joiner may have been trying to make good on earlier alleged representations to KIP and the Chinese investors \u2013 as part of the production agreement, Murphy was expected to secure a distributor for the film.</p> <p>\u201cThough Murphy had taken steps toward the production of the film, such as contacting agents and film talent, no actor or director had committed to the film \u2013 including Guillermo del Toro,\u201d the affidavit reads.</p> <p>Joiner later notified Murphy that he would be closing the escrow account due to lack of interest in the project, the affidavit says, and transferred him $200,000 \u2013 possibly some form of kill fee. Murphy told the FBI he emailed Joiner in the summer of 2017 to formally end their business relationship. Joiner never responded, and Murphy hasn\u2019t heard from him since.</p> <p>Still, the web of lies seemed to expand. Joiner soon informed KIP executives that he was courting Amblin Partners to replace Netflix as the distributor for Legends. On 2 December 2016, John Yi, Huh\u2019s Korean associate, circulated a \u201cmemorandum of understanding\u201d between Dark Planet and Amblin to KIP personnel. According to the affidavit, it provided that Amblin would take over distribution rights to Legends and was signed by Joiner and, purportedly, Michael Wright, formerly the CEO of Amblin.</p> <p>Wright, currently president of the Epix cable network, later told the FBI he did not know Joiner, and was not familiar with Dark Planet or Legends. He denied having entered into any of the purported agreements and claimed the signature on the memo circulated to KIP staff was not his.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/26/marvel-mastermind-kevin-feige-to-develop-new-star-wars-film\">Marvel mastermind Kevin Feige to develop new Star Wars film</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In March, Joiner emailed Paul Huh a statement for the Legends<em> </em>bank account, investigators contend, indicating a balance of more than $11.7m. FBI analysis of the account revealed the statement to be a forgery, and that during the period reflected, it only held $32,628.93.</p> <p>Later that month, Joiner allegedly told Huh that production was delayed due to \u201cinternal politics with Amblin\u201d. He claimed that the actor Bradley Cooper had turned down a lead role, according to the affidavit, and as a result, a newly brought on co-producing studio, Universal, had refused payment to Amblin.</p> <p>Perhaps catching on to the grift, or perhaps believing Joiner failed on a good-faith effort to produce an ambitiously high-value movie, executives at KIP requested their investment be returned.

      "bodyText": "On paper, Legends looked like a box-office hit. Adam Joiner billed his movie as an anachronistic mash-up of legendary 19th-century American figures, a steampunk Avengers \u2013 tailor-made to satiate the ever-expanding appetite for big-ticket, fantasy-action pictures. With Endgame, the latest Avengers installment, grossing more than $1.2bn in its opening weekend, it isn\u2019t hard to understand how Joiner was able to secure a relatively measly $14m in investment for the project. The only problem? Beyond its screenplay, Legends didn\u2019t exist \u2013 and it never would. Joiner, 41, was arrested on 27 August and was charged in a Los Angeles federal court with wire fraud, money laundering and aggravated identity theft. Prosecutors allege he orchestrated an elaborate scheme of fraud, convincing at least two foreign firms to invest millions in Legends. Through email and telephone communications, and a series of forged documents, federal prosecutors say, he claimed to have executed distribution agreements with companies like Netflix and Amblin Partners, Steven Spielberg\u2019s production outfit. In reality, no such agreements were made, the prosecutors charge, and Joiner did very little with the ill-gotten funds to produce a film. \u201cHe spent much of the money on himself,\u201d including on the purchase of a $5m home in Manhattan Beach, California, the FBI special agent Nathan Cherney wrote in an affidavit to the criminal complaint. Sweeping epics in the style of Game of Thrones or the recently Disney-fied Star Wars universe have inspired an undeniable gold rush for premium content \u2013 so much so that the genre has, in some ways, come to define the contemporary economics of the film industry. The success of Marvel, the comic publisher turned studio juggernaut, has been particularly game-changing, building the concept of epic \u201cfilm universes\u201d. \u201cIts success inspired a slew of other franchises to pursue film-verses,\u201d the media reporter Ashley Rodriguez wrote for Quartz in 2017. \u201cLucasfilm, also owned by Disney, borrowed the model for Star Wars, which studio boss Kathleen Kennedy hopes to carry on for another decade. Hasbro is rolling out its Transformers and GI Joe franchises into a broader movie-verse, based on its popular children\u2019s toys. Warner Bros and JK Rowling are creating a cinematic universe set in the Harry Potter author\u2019s magical world.\u201d The story behind Legends begins in South Korea, according to the affidavit to the criminal complaint. Paul Huh, a director with Korean Investment Partners Co, Ltd (KIP), told the FBI he met Adam Joiner in late 2015 through John Yi, a Korean associate. Joiner hailed from Granite Bay, California, a small town of just over 20,000 in the Sacramento area. He described himself as the owner of a film production company called Dark Planet Pictures, LLC, the affidavit says, and claimed to be seeking investment to produce a screenplay written by his brother, Andrew. Adam had registered Dark Planet with the California secretary of state\u2019s office in 2014, and although the company\u2019s registration is currently inactive, he and his brother are listed as one-time officers. (Andrew Joiner has not been named in the case against Adam.) Joiner came to the table with what he claimed was a pre-existing relationship with Netflix, Huh told the FBI. \u201cThings have begun to pick up steam with Netflix as a potential distributor of the film,\u201d Joiner wrote in a February 2016 email to Huh that is referenced in the affidavit. \u201cI have another meeting with them this week,\u201d he added. \u201cOn Netflix, I have another good meeting with them yesterday, and expect to receive a contract from them by the end of the week,\u201d Joiner allegedly wrote three days later. Before KIP would agree to invest in Legends, Huh wanted to see a copy of the Netflix deal. He told investigators he received a fax bearing a Netflix-branded cover sheet two days later. It included a letter, dated 5 April 2016, purporting to \u201cconfirm that an agreement between Netflix, Inc and Dark Planet Pictures, LLC, was executed March 31st 2016\u201d. The letter was allegedly signed by an individual titled \u201cVice President, Business &amp; Legal Affairs/Content Acquisition\u201d. That same day, according to the affidavit, Joiner forwarded an email that purported to come from said executive, and used an email address affixed to a Netflix domain. Attached was what the FBI alleges to be a fabricated distribution agreement between Netflix and Dark Planet. The agreement was reportedly signed by Joiner on behalf of Dark Planet, and by an individual titled \u201cChief Content Officer\u201d on behalf of Netflix. The affidavit says Joiner then forwarded an email from a third executive on 8 April, 2016, which read: \u201cLook forward to making this movie!\u201d Huh was convinced. Through one of its subsidiary investment funds, KIP wired $4m (half of the agreed-upon $8m) into a Bank of America account in the name of \u201cLegends Film Co, LLC\u201d. FBI interviews with the aforementioned executives (all identities were redacted in the affidavit) revealed the agreement and associated communiqu\u00e9s had been falsified. The executives said they weren\u2019t familiar with Joiner, Dark Planet, or Legends; and two of the executives were no longer Netflix employees (one had only ever been a contractor to begin with). They denied the signatures on the agreement were theirs. The following month, acting on behalf of Dark Planet, Joiner allegedly entered into another investment agreement, this time with two Chinese firms: Star Century Pictures Co, Ltd, and one of its affiliates, PGA Yungpark Capital, Ltd. That agreement referenced a supposed commitment by Netflix to acquire the distribution rights to Legends, which was cited in the contract as \u201ca material basis for [Star Century\u2019s] decision to invest\u201d, according to the affidavit. Attached to the agreement was the same fabricated distribution agreement that Joiner is alleged to have provided KIP, with the forged signature of one of the purported Netflix executives. On 3 June 2016, Yungpark wired $6m into the Legends bank account. With roughly $10m in hand, Joiner\u2019s alleged machinations progressed. On 29 June 2016, according to the affidavit, he wrote in an email to Paul Huh: \u201c[W]e are expecting to secure Don Murphy by this Friday to be our \u2018name\u2019 Producer for the film.\u201d Murphy is perhaps most famous for producing the high-budget, CGI-heavy Transformers trilogy. In the email, Joiner claimed Murphy had proposed bringing in the director Michael Bay, who also directed the Transformers films, as well as other battle-scene-packed pictures such as Armageddon and Pearl Harbor. In a later email to Huh and Star Century executive Ma Xue, Joiner allegedly wrote: \u201cWe agreed to terms verbally yesterday with Guillermo del Toro and his agent.\u201d Del Toro is another director-darling of the fantasy and sci-fi genres, having directed two Hellboy films as well as the critically acclaimed Pan\u2019s Labyrinth. Murphy later told the FBI he had been retained by Joiner to produce Legends \u2013 though the project had been pitched under an alternate title, Folkwar. Under the agreement, Murphy was to receive $1.2m in exchange for producing services. Half of that amount was paid to an escrow account linked to the project. In hiring Murphy, Joiner may have been trying to make good on earlier alleged representations to KIP and the Chinese investors \u2013 as part of the production agreement, Murphy was expected to secure a distributor for the film. \u201cThough Murphy had taken steps toward the production of the film, such as contacting agents and film talent, no actor or director had committed to the film \u2013 including Guillermo del Toro,\u201d the affidavit reads. Joiner later notified Murphy that he would be closing the escrow account due to lack of interest in the project, the affidavit says, and transferred him $200,000 \u2013 possibly some form of kill fee. Murphy told the FBI he emailed Joiner in the summer of 2017 to formally end their business relationship. Joiner never responded, and Murphy hasn\u2019t heard from him since. Still, the web of lies seemed to expand. Joiner soon informed KIP executives that he was courting Amblin Partners to replace Netflix as the distributor for Legends. On 2 December 2016, John Yi, Huh\u2019s Korean associate, circulated a \u201cmemorandum of understanding\u201d between Dark Planet and Amblin to KIP personnel. According to the affidavit, it provided that Amblin would take over distribution rights to Legends and was signed by Joiner and, purportedly, Michael Wright, formerly the CEO of Amblin. Wright, currently president of the Epix cable network, later told the FBI he did not know Joiner, and was not familiar with Dark Planet or Legends. He denied having entered into any of the purported agreements and claimed the signature on the memo circulated to KIP staff was not his. In March, Joiner emailed Paul Huh a statement for the Legends bank account, investigators contend, indicating a balance of more than $11.7m. FBI analysis of the account revealed the statement to be a forgery, and that during the period reflected, it only held $32,628.93. Later that month, Joiner allegedly told Huh that production was delayed due to \u201cinternal politics with Amblin\u201d. He claimed that the actor Bradley Cooper had turned down a lead role, according to the affidavit, and as a result, a newly brought on co-producing studio, Universal, had refused payment to Amblin. Perhaps catching on to the grift, or perhaps believing Joiner failed on a good-faith effort to produce an ambitiously high-value movie, executives at KIP requested their investment be returned. Joiner agreed, and allegedly promised to immediately reimburse them. But the payment, the FBI says, never came through. On behalf of KIP, Yi contacted Don Murphy to inquire about the holdup. This allegedly caused Joiner to email Yi on 13 July 2017 with what appears to be a veiled legal threat: \u201cI understand you attempted to contact Don Murphy and his office. Please cease and desist any attempts at contacting Mr. Murphy, whether in person or by phone, or it shall be deemed harassment.\u201d The FBI says accounting of the bank account allegedly maintained by Joiner for producing Legends revealed that, aside from the amounts wired from KIP and the Chinese investors, only two deposits were made: a $10,000 transfer from an account in the name of Allison Joiner, whom FBI officials believe to be Adam Joiner\u2019s wife, and a $600,000 counter credit that appears to be a recalled check for the same amount. There were several withdrawals, according to the analysis: in June 2016, $165,500 went to an escrow account seemingly unrelated to production \u2013 FBI investigators believe that was a security deposit for the purchase of a Manhattan Beach, California, property. A payment of $5,192,916.92 was made in August of that year \u2013 allegedly the full payment for that property. Investigators speculate two transfers amounting a total of $4,360,000 to a bank account under the name of Stock Car Willie, LLC, were linked to a film project of the same name Joiner may have been developing. And between April of 2016 and June of 2017, a total of $1,345,000 was transferred to another account in the name of Adam and Allison Joiner, according to the analysis. Joiner\u2019s case is hardly the only Hollywood content con to have made headlines. As of publication, the so-called \u201cCon Queen\u201d of Tinseltown \u2013 an evasive, thus-far unidentified figure who stands accused of stealing thousands of dollars from film-makers and producers by impersonating studio honchos like Amy Pascal of Sony \u2013 remains at large. \u201cHollywood is more susceptible to impersonation-type frauds,\u201d says Sne\u017eana Gebauer, executive managing director and head of the US investigations and disputes practice at K2 Intelligence, a private firm currently investigating the Con Queen case. \u201cIdentity theft is becoming more prevalent everywhere, but it\u2019s easier to do on high-profile people, because there\u2019s so much information out there.

In the 12 months ending July 2017, the rate of suicide for university students in England and Wales was 4.7 deaths per 100,000 students, which equates to 95 suicides or about one death every four days.</p> <p>The crisis in student mental health hit the news in 2017 after a high number of <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-45624695\" title=\"\">suicides at Bristol University</a>. Over 18 months, starting in October 2016, 12 students are believed to have killed themselves. While the university tried to tackle the crisis, it struggled to keep up with the rising demand for help. In November 2018, a group of students gathered on a chilly Bristol street holding placards demanding better access to psychological support. The students told reporters that despite promises of more investment in student wellbeing, services were still badly overstretched.</p> <p><a href=\"https://epigram.org.uk/2018/04/27/exclusion-under-the-fitness-to-study-policy/\" title=\"\">Ruth Day</a>, who helped organise the protest, had been suspended for eight weeks under a rule which says students can be sent home if they are <a href=\"https://www.bristol.ac.uk/media-library/sites/secretary/documents/student-rules-and-regs/fitness-to-study-policy.pdf\" title=\"\">considered unfit to study</a>, or their presence poses a risk to themselves or others.

On World Mental Health Day in October 2018, students at University College London disrupted an open day with a demonstration about waiting times for counselling. In March this year, Goldsmiths students occupied Deptford town hall, calling for better access to counselling for BAME students.

In September 2018, the Times described today\u2019s students as \u201cGeneration Snowflake\u201d and suggested that \u201chelicopter parents\u201d had \u201ccoddled the minds\u201d of young people. Meanwhile, some university staff worry that teaching is having to come second to supporting students\u2019 emotional needs.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the most worrying phenomena that many of us have witnessed in recent years is the rise of chronic anxiety, that afflicts some students so deeply that they feel unable to come to the campus at all,\u201d says William Davies, lecturer at Goldsmiths and author of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/03/the-happiness-industry-by-william-davies-review\" title=\"\">The Happiness Industry</a>, a book about the commercialisation of wellbeing. \u201cAbove all, a growing proportion just seem terrified of failure, and experience the whole process of learning and assessment as an unforgiving ordeal that offers no room for creativity or mistakes.\u201d</p> <p>Given that about half of young people in the UK now go to university, the number of students seeking help inevitably reflects a wider crisis in young people\u2019s mental health. One <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/sep/11/mental-health-issues-in-young-people-up-sixfold-in-england-since-1995\" title=\"\">study found</a> that six times more young people in England (aged four to 24) have psychological problems today than a generation ago, in 1995. Budget cuts to social work, youth services, the NHS and state schools over the last decade mean that many young people experiencing problems do not get any help at all before they reach university, where they meet a new set of challenges.</p> <p>\u201cUniversities are just a reflection of what goes on in the whole society,\u201d says Irene Stone, a counsellor at Brunel University. \u201cThere are a lot of demands on young people today. The pressure is shifting on how we work \u2013 now we don\u2019t just have one job, we juggle three. There are pressures of technology, managing social platforms, forming relationships. It can all cause a lot of anxiety and stress.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"95b78d7ae275e187c901834810af08f35c843171\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/95b78d7ae275e187c901834810af08f35c843171/0_387_4320_2592/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Natasha Abrahart, a student at Bristol University, killed herself in April 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Natasha Abrahart, a student at Bristol University, killed herself in April 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The University of the West of England, Bristol, recently released a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-47883358\" title=\"\">report into the deaths of the 14 students </a>who took their own lives there between 2010 and 2018. It found that half of the suicides occurred between January and April, when students were preparing for exams.</p> <p>In the drive to make universities profitable, there is a fundamental confusion about what they are for. As a result, there has been a shift from prizing learning as an end in itself to equipping graduates for the job market, in what for some can be a joyless environment.</p> <p>Expectations have changed radically over the last two decades \u2013 not least because students paying thousands of pounds in fees expect a certain level of service in return. I spoke to academics around the country who expressed their own anxiety that they might miss a vital sign that one of their students is struggling. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely stressful to have this extra responsibility that we aren\u2019t really equipped for, especially when many of us are already operating in an atmosphere of uncertain working conditions,\u201d said one academic.</p> <p>Of course, universities have a duty of care to their students, but as the situation stands, we are expecting them to fill the role of parent and therapist as well as educator. These are institutions under terrible strain, striving to adapt to new demands. The question is not only whether they can fix the crisis in young people\u2019s mental health, but whether it is their job to do so.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Ever since Tony Blair pledged in 1999 to get 50% of young people into university, \u201cwidening participation\u201d has been a political priority. It has more or less been achieved: in 2017, official figures showed that 49% of people in England entered advanced studies by the age of 30. University degrees have become a requirement for many jobs which previously allowed people to start as school-leavers and work their way up.</p> <p>At the same time as access to university was dramatically expanded, spending on public services was slashed: in the decade after the financial crash, day-to-day spending on public services as a share of GDP was at its lowest since the late 1930s. This meant savage cuts to local authorities, schools budgets and NHS mental health provision. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/nov/27/mental-healthcare-england-children-referred-gp-not-treated\" title=\"\">Figures released in November 2017 </a>showed that two-thirds of under-18s referred for specialist mental healthcare in England were not receiving treatment, while there had been a 30% fall in hospital beds available for acute mental health conditions since 2009.</p> <p>In search of a cause for the dramatic increase in mental health problems among young people, studies have looked at the impact of social media, or lack of sleep caused by electronic devices, as well as the effects of an uncertain job market, personal debt and constricted public services. In his book Kids These Days: The Making of Millennials, Malcolm Harris argues that far from the stereotype of young people being entitled and narcissistic, millennials are harder working but poorer than their parents\u2019 generation. Harris identifies the pressures of the labour market, rising student debt and a target-driven culture as contributing to steep increases in anxiety and depression among young people. \u201cYoung people feel \u2013 reasonably accurately \u2013 less in control of their lives than ever before,\u201d he writes.</p> <p>With about half of 18-year-olds now going to university, inevitably that population will follow the same patterns as the rest of society. \u201cAnd some of their cases are very complex,\u201d says Steve West, vice-chancellor of the University of the West of England and chair of the mental health working group for Universities UK (UUK), the steering body for British universities.</p> <p>The Office for National Statistics <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/articles/estimatingsuicideamonghighereducationstudentsenglandandwalesexperimentalstatistics/2018-06-25\" title=\"\">produced a report</a> on England and Wales last year which found that in the past, students were less likely than the general population to commit suicide, and that the recent spike had merely brought them more in line with the rest of the population aged under 24. If universities once provided a respite from the pressures of the world of work, they no longer do. Now they compete with one another for students and the hefty fees they pay.</p> <p>In 1998, universal free higher education ended: fees of \u00a31,000 per year were introduced, and maintenance grants were replaced with loans to be paid back when the student started earning more than \u00a310,000 a year. Since then, costs have risen. In 2006, fees were raised to \u00a33,000 a year. In 2012, this went up to \u00a39,000. In 2017, the cap went up to \u00a39,250, and is expected to keep rising. The average student now leaves university with about \u00a350,000 of debt.</p> <p>\u201cDriving our universities to act like businesses doesn\u2019t just cannibalise the joy of learning and the social utility of research and teaching; it also makes us ill,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.redpepper.org.uk/a-mental-health-crisis-is-the-true-cost-of-university-marketization/\" title=\"\">wrote Mark Crawford</a>, then a postgraduate student union officer at UCL, in a 2018 piece for Red Pepper magazine. When I spoke to Crawford, he reeled off a list of ways in which university, as it is structured, can worsen student mental health. \u201cIt\u2019s self-worth being reduced to academic outcomes, support services being cut, the massive cost of housing,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"84c03394570cd604c357e6df129aeb405fa78215\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/84c03394570cd604c357e6df129aeb405fa78215/0_343_8256_4954/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bristol University student Ruth Day.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bristol University student Ruth Day helped to organise a protest demanding better access to psychological support.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When Crawford was working for the UCL student union \u2013 from 2016 to 2018 \u2013 it launched a petition for the university to improve mental health services, which got 2,000 signatures within a week. The campaign drew a direct link between the university\u2019s large overall budgets and its low spending on mental health services. \u201cUniversities enact policies and a structure of learning that encourages poor mental health among students while at the same time underfunding services that could offset the consequences,\u201d Crawford told me. After the students\u2019 campaign, UCL agreed to hire three more counsellors.</p> <p>But the problems cannot all be solved with more counsellors. William Leahy, Brunel\u2019s deputy vice-chancellor, has been closely involved in his university\u2019s efforts to improve mental health support. He points out that starting university might be the first time many students access any kind of psychological help. \u201cWe have seen unbelievable underfunding of secondary schools over many years \u2013 and not just schools but social services, youth clubs, all those services that used to be preventative, they\u2019ve all gone.\u201d This places an extra burden on universities to take on the responsibilities of the health or social services.</p> <p>Successive prime ministers have urged more young people to go to university, with the promise of a better job at the end of it. But given the sluggish state of the economy since the 2008 crash, and the scarcity of graduate-level jobs, the connection is hardly clear. \u201cThe context of stagnating job markets can make university seem like a three-year job application,\u201d says Crawford.</p> <p>Many lecturers I spoke to noted that their students place intense pressure on themselves to get a first-class degree or to take on extra commitments so that they can stand out from the crowd. Some can\u2019t keep it up. Dropout rates have increased every year since 2015, with high fees and lack of support for disadvantaged or troubled students cited as two possible reasons. At the worst affected universities one in five students drop out before the end of their first year.</p> <p>\u201cClearly university and essay writing have always produced stress, but I do think something new has appeared since the fees and debt rose so sharply, which raise the stakes to a whole new level,\u201d says Davies, the Goldsmiths lecturer. \u201cVery few students respond to this as the government would like \u2013 as demanding consumers \u2013 and a large number simply shrink from the situation, or drop out altogether.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Brunel University, on the outer edge of west London, is one institution where the shockwaves of government policy are felt. Built in the 1960s, it has been subject to all the drastic changes the university sector has undergone, but is not part of the elite Russell Group, so its student intake tends to be from a broader range of backgrounds, some with complex needs. Like other universities, it is struggling to deal with increasing mental health problems among students, and in the last few years it has been forced to rethink its mental health provisions, making it easier to access counselling and mentoring, and training lecturers and other staff in mental health first aid.</p> <p>When Sean Cullen started at Brunel in 2014, he knew that he would need support: a serious motorcycle accident during his gap year meant that he could not walk. Before moving on to Brunel\u2019s campus, he discussed wheelchair access with the university. \u201cI was incredibly pleased,\u201d he told me when we met at a bustling coffee shop on campus. \u201cThey had everything in place, so I didn\u2019t need to worry.\u201d He settled into university life, but the same day-to-day pressures that affected most of his peers \u2013 deadlines and money management \u2013 began to feel overwhelming.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a combination of lots of different things at once,\u201d he recalls. \u201cStress of studying, worry about the future. I found myself constantly feeling like I should be doing something, but the thought of doing any of those things made me stay doing nothing.\u201d He tried to access the university counselling service, which at that point was run on a drop-in basis, so he could not make an appointment. There was a long queue and he wasn\u2019t seen. In the end, despairing of seeing a counsellor face to face, he sought support from an online forum.</p> <p>\u201cStudent terms are quite short,\u201d says Lesley O\u2019Keeffe, deputy director of academic and student services at Brunel. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got a four- or five-week waiting list, it might not sound very long, but that\u2019s half a term. The amount of living they can lose in that time is quite significant.\u201d</p> <p>Cullen, now 24, was struck by the contrast in the care he had received for his physical and mental health. \u201cYou can see physical disabilities, so it\u2019s a lot easier to fix the symptoms. You\u2019re in a wheelchair, you can\u2019t climb stairs, so we\u2019ll provide a lift: job done,\u201d he says. \u201cBut if you\u2019ve got anxiety and are struggling to go to classes \u2013 well, there\u2019s no short answer.\u201d</p> <p>A greater number of young people arriving with more complex home situations, who have not managed to get help in the NHS, means that universities are facing a perfect storm. Joyce (not her real name) is 25, a second-year undergraduate student at Brunel. She is studying a science subject, which she likes partly because of the order it represents. \u201cIn life, you come across problems you can\u2019t find a solution for, but when it comes to numbers and data, you normally always find a solution,\u201d she told me when we met at Brunel on a snowy day in January.</p> <p>In her own life, she has often experienced problems with no solution. Joyce, who grew up in London, had an abusive childhood, and is now completely estranged from her family. Undergraduate living has been challenging for her. At first, she moved on to campus, but found it intensely stressful living in halls, in close quarters to people in relationships, couples fighting, flatmates bickering \u2013 all the complications of cohabiting. \u201cMy adult brain had to deal with the childhood stuff that it had locked away,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Now she rents privately in the area. Her living costs are not covered by her termly maintenance loans, so she works several different part time jobs on zero-hours contracts. Added to the daily stress of exams and deadlines, this is a gruelling schedule. \u201cAt the moment, all I do is study and work,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Brunel, like most universities, has a range of social activities \u2013 from club nights to prayer groups. But over the last couple of years, Cullen and the rest of the student union staff have noticed a fall in participation. It\u2019s getting harder to fill up events, most likely a symptom of the sharp increase in students living far away from campus to save money \u2013 over 50% of the student body now commute. Many opt to live with their parents, as much as two or three hours\u2019 drive away, to save money. Others have limited time as they juggle studies with paid work. It is another sign of the pressure weighing on students that they allow themselves less time for fun.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Over the last two years, many universities have taken steps to reduce waiting time for counselling, launched courses on managing stress and anxiety, made support services easier to access, and tried to make students more aware of what is available \u2013 although Steve West at UUK acknowledges efforts are \u201cvariable\u201d. Some, including Birmingham University and the London School of Economics, did not have a procedure for dealing with students\u2019 mental health problems as late as last year. Some universities are increasing funding for wellbeing and counselling services: at Bristol, spending doubled from 2016 to 2017.</p> <p>Counselling may be helpful for many people, but it can\u2019t address the stresses built into university life, which can compound mental health problems or create new ones. For Cullen, money worries have been a grinding and ever-present aspect of his university experience. In addition to the \u00a39,000 in tuition fee loans, he has received between \u00a37,000 and \u00a38,000 each year in maintenance loans for living costs. Generally, this just about covers the cost of rent, leaving little to live on. \u201cYou learn fast as a student what\u2019s the bare minimum you can get away with,\u201d he says. In his first year, he socialised more than he does now. But given that a single night out costs as much as a weekly food shop, he soon began to think twice about going out with friends. To complicate matters, the amount he receives from Student Finance England, the body responsible for student loans, changed year by year, with unpredictable amounts and repayment terms. \u201cThe financial aid is getting worse and worse, even though the cost of living is going up,\u201d he says.</p> <p>In 2017, Cullen was elected as the student union\u2019s disability officer. As well as advocating for disabled students, this meant helping with the union\u2019s Advice and Representation Centre, where students can come for advice on housing, mental health and academic or financial problems. He heard accounts of mental health problems from hundreds of other students, many of whose experiences chimed with his own. \u201cI\u2019ve not yet met a student that hasn\u2019t experienced high levels of stress while studying, whether it\u2019s because of deadlines, balancing paid work, or problems with housing,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ec17a3cff172258829a8f1c75b56ca11fcd30627\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec17a3cff172258829a8f1c75b56ca11fcd30627/0_44_4000_2399/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A therapy dog resting.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Many universities have organised \u2018therapy pets\u2019 for exam periods \u2013 that students can pet to ease their stress.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While many students survive more or less on their overdrafts, Cullen has noticed that many have mental health problems in their final year. \u201cNowadays, getting a degree doesn\u2019t necessarily guarantee you a job, or not a better job than without one,\u201d he says.</p> <p>According to a 2014 report, a significant number of students <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/aug/11/students-work-part-time-employability\" title=\"\">(45%) do paid part-time</a> work alongside their studies, with 13% doing a 35-hour week. Inevitably, this has an impact not only on academic performance but on students\u2019 ability to fully participate in university life. \u201cWe sometimes get students coming to lectures having just done a night shift, and we can see they\u2019re tired and might not be in the best frame of mind to be learning,\u201d says Michael Thomas, a lecturer in social work at Brunel.</p> <p>Students exhausted from working while studying full time, and still struggling to cover their basic living costs, are bound to be more anxious about deadlines and exams. \u201cIt\u2019s all the environmental stuff that makes it more stressful,\u201d says Thomas. \u201cIf you\u2019re tired, you haven\u2019t had time to study, you have to make a long journey to university, it\u2019s all cumulative.\u201d</p> <p>Some of the more attention-grabbing measures that universities have introduced do nothing to address these fundamental questions. This year Bristol University introduced a course in the science of happiness, a unit that, alongside lectures, will include happiness \u201cexercises\u201d to be practised for a week at a time, such as sleeping more, meditation, savouring enjoyment and performing random acts of kindness. It can count towards a degree. In the past few years, Cambridge, Brunel, London Metropolitan and Warwick, among many others, have organised \u201ctherapy pets\u201d for exam periods \u2013 dogs, cats and guinea pigs that students can pet to ease their stress. To augment overstretched counselling services, many universities run free yoga or mindfulness courses.</p> <p>\u201cOften these measures are being done instead of properly funding mental health services,\u201d says Crawford, the former UCL student. \u201cUniversities are competing for students. Therapy dogs look nice and are cost-effective. It\u2019s insulting.\u201d</p> <p>Even if they are helpful for some people, such measures can only provide short-term relief, as Leahy, the Brunel deputy vice-chancellor, acknowledges. \u201cIn one sense, the system inherently pressurises people, while at the same time you\u2019re saying, \u2018chill out, relax, it\u2019s all fine\u2019.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>After the rise in suicides, in 2017 a national strategy was launched by UUK, giving out new guidelines to help universities improve the way they handle mental health. The guidance gave a boost to work that was already being done at Brunel. While two years earlier Cullen had found the system hard to navigate and slow, the process had been improved. \u201cOur waiting lists are better, students can see the right person quicker, or multiple people if that\u2019s what they need,\u201d says O\u2019Keeffe.</p> <p>While Brunel has made a concerted effort to invest in student mental health services and reduce waiting times, across the UK this is patchy. Former health minister and mental health campaigner Norman Lamb recently gathered information from 110 universities, and found that many do not even record their counselling waiting lists or budgets for support services. He told the BBC: \u201cIf we are operating in a fog, if we have no idea how long students are waiting ... this is putting students at risk. We know from the data that the longest waiting times could be over half a term for some students. We know also that there have been some tragedies among some student populations \u2013 students who have taken their own lives. If that happens while they are waiting for support, that\u2019s utterly intolerable.\u201d</p> <p>When Leah (not her real name) started at Brunel in autumn 2018, she thought carefully about disclosing her history of bipolar disorder and anxiety. She was in her mid-30s and had spent much of the previous decade in and out of hospital. She had been sectioned more than once. Brunel, where she is studying for a postgraduate degree, was going to be a new start. \u201cI don\u2019t want to deal with other people\u2019s prejudices as well,\u201d she told me when we met in a quiet room on Brunel\u2019s campus. \u201cI\u2019d rather just be accepted for who I am.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/apr/30/busting-the-myth-that-depression-doesnt-affect-people-in-poor-countries\">Busting the myth that depression doesn't affect people in poor countries</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is not an uncommon dilemma: <a href=\"https://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/policy-and-analysis/stepchange/Pages/framework.aspx\" title=\"\">a key part of the new strategy is for universities</a> to encourage students to disclose that they have a problem. Teachers and staff I interviewed said many of their students worry that telling the university about their condition might adversely affect their degree result. Leah, who rents a flat some distance from the campus, doesn\u2019t talk to her peers about her condition, but she did disclose it to the university. When she started at Brunel, the new strategy for dealing with mental health had been in action for a year, and things went smoothly. She was set up with a counsellor and a mentor, who helps her manage her time and offers practical advice.</p> <p>A few weeks after starting, Leah found herself sitting in the library, completely overwhelmed. Her mind was whirring: had she expected too much of herself by coming back to university? Should she quit? How would she bear the shame of telling her friends and family she couldn\u2019t manage it? She spoke to her mentor, and in a very short space of time they had helped her to switch to a part-time master\u2019s, meaning that her course would be spread over two years rather than completed in one. That also meant she could get a part-time job.</p> <p>Leah\u2019s problems first surfaced when she first went to university. She was younger then, and less sure about what help she needed or was entitled to. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing needing the support, and another being aware that you need it,\u201d she says. Although graduating was a triumph, the following eight years were often harrowing, with Leah in and out of hospital as she struggled to manage her condition.</p> <p>Having decided to return to university, Leah was anxious about how she would cope with the stress \u2013 she likes to keep busy, but stress can trigger manic episodes. But she has been pleasantly surprised. It has actually been easier to access certain kinds of support than it was outside university. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of cuts in the community, and I\u2019ve been on a waiting list for NHS counselling for years now,\u201d she says. At Brunel, she sees a counsellor regularly.</p> <p>When communication between university and health service works, it can provide valuable support. Leah is still supported by a mental health crisis team in her borough. The university is in touch with the team and can inform them if they have concerns about Leah, and vice versa. \u201cNo matter how well put together I am, that vulnerability is still there,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I have a safety net to catch me if anything does go wrong.\u201d</p> <p>Everyone I spoke to in university administration around the country viewed mental health support as part of their duty to students, but they are struggling to meet the need. \u201cWe\u2019re not residential care and we don\u2019t have live-in staff,\u201d says O\u2019Keeffe at Brunel. \u201cSometimes there\u2019s an expectation, even by our local services, that we can do more than we can do. We\u2019re not here to give medical treatment or take the place of the NHS. Our aim is to get everyone to achieve the best they can. Everyone here at some point wanted to get a degree. If that desire is still in them, that\u2019s what we try and work with them for.\u201d</p> <p>Yet even as university mental health provisions slowly improve, the particular stress of university life continues. \u201cAt the end of the day, it doesn\u2019t matter what a counsellor says to you if you can\u2019t afford to pay your rent,\u201d says Crawford. \u201cThe way universities currently operate is manufacturing conditions that create poor mental health. So at the very least, they should invest some resources so that everyone can be seen and supported.\u201d</p> <p><em>In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email <a href=\"https://www.samaritans.org/\" title=\"\">jo@samaritans.org</a> or jo@samaritans.ie.

      "bodyText": "When he started working at Brunel University London 19 years ago, Terry Vass, who is now head of security, recalls that most of his work involved breaking up drunken fights outside the bars and nightclub on campus. Over the two decades he has been in the job, he has noticed a shift. Now, an increasing number of calls are for mental health incidents. The worst times are at the start of term, when students are adjusting to being away from home, or over the holidays, when the small number who remain on campus may feel lonely and isolated. Increasingly, Vass\u2019s security team are called out to mental health emergencies, sometimes accompanying suicidal students to A&amp;E and staying with them. \u201cWe spend as much time as it takes,\u201d says Vass. On occasion, he has spent six hours with a student in distress. British universities are experiencing a surge in student anxiety, mental breakdowns and depression. There has been a sharp rise in students dropping out \u2013 of the 2015 intake, 26,000 left in their first year, an increase for the third year running \u2013 and an alarming number of suicides. In the 12 months ending July 2017, the rate of suicide for university students in England and Wales was 4.7 deaths per 100,000 students, which equates to 95 suicides or about one death every four days. The crisis in student mental health hit the news in 2017 after a high number of suicides at Bristol University. Over 18 months, starting in October 2016, 12 students are believed to have killed themselves. While the university tried to tackle the crisis, it struggled to keep up with the rising demand for help. In November 2018, a group of students gathered on a chilly Bristol street holding placards demanding better access to psychological support. The students told reporters that despite promises of more investment in student wellbeing, services were still badly overstretched. Ruth Day, who helped organise the protest, had been suspended for eight weeks under a rule which says students can be sent home if they are considered unfit to study, or their presence poses a risk to themselves or others. Day said being suspended made her feel \u201cterrified\u201d and \u201chopeless\u201d. Just a few months earlier, in April 2018, Natasha Abrahart, a 20-year-old physics student at Bristol who suffered from severe anxiety, killed herself on the day she was due to have an oral assessment. Her parents said they would take legal action against the university for failing to offer Natasha an alternative to the oral test, which she saw as an unbearable ordeal. Students around the country feel their universities are failing them. On World Mental Health Day in October 2018, students at University College London disrupted an open day with a demonstration about waiting times for counselling. In March this year, Goldsmiths students occupied Deptford town hall, calling for better access to counselling for BAME students. Student protests and demands for better mental health services are frequently dismissed in the press. \u201cWe just can\u2019t cope with essay deadlines, and tests stress us out, moan \u2018snowflake\u2019 students,\u201d read a headline in the Daily Mail in November 2017. In September 2018, the Times described today\u2019s students as \u201cGeneration Snowflake\u201d and suggested that \u201chelicopter parents\u201d had \u201ccoddled the minds\u201d of young people. Meanwhile, some university staff worry that teaching is having to come second to supporting students\u2019 emotional needs. \u201cOne of the most worrying phenomena that many of us have witnessed in recent years is the rise of chronic anxiety, that afflicts some students so deeply that they feel unable to come to the campus at all,\u201d says William Davies, lecturer at Goldsmiths and author of The Happiness Industry, a book about the commercialisation of wellbeing. \u201cAbove all, a growing proportion just seem terrified of failure, and experience the whole process of learning and assessment as an unforgiving ordeal that offers no room for creativity or mistakes.\u201d Given that about half of young people in the UK now go to university, the number of students seeking help inevitably reflects a wider crisis in young people\u2019s mental health. One study found that six times more young people in England (aged four to 24) have psychological problems today than a generation ago, in 1995. Budget cuts to social work, youth services, the NHS and state schools over the last decade mean that many young people experiencing problems do not get any help at all before they reach university, where they meet a new set of challenges. \u201cUniversities are just a reflection of what goes on in the whole society,\u201d says Irene Stone, a counsellor at Brunel University. \u201cThere are a lot of demands on young people today. The pressure is shifting on how we work \u2013 now we don\u2019t just have one job, we juggle three. There are pressures of technology, managing social platforms, forming relationships. It can all cause a lot of anxiety and stress.\u201d The University of the West of England, Bristol, recently released a report into the deaths of the 14 students who took their own lives there between 2010 and 2018. It found that half of the suicides occurred between January and April, when students were preparing for exams. In the drive to make universities profitable, there is a fundamental confusion about what they are for. As a result, there has been a shift from prizing learning as an end in itself to equipping graduates for the job market, in what for some can be a joyless environment. Expectations have changed radically over the last two decades \u2013 not least because students paying thousands of pounds in fees expect a certain level of service in return. I spoke to academics around the country who expressed their own anxiety that they might miss a vital sign that one of their students is struggling. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely stressful to have this extra responsibility that we aren\u2019t really equipped for, especially when many of us are already operating in an atmosphere of uncertain working conditions,\u201d said one academic. Of course, universities have a duty of care to their students, but as the situation stands, we are expecting them to fill the role of parent and therapist as well as educator. These are institutions under terrible strain, striving to adapt to new demands. The question is not only whether they can fix the crisis in young people\u2019s mental health, but whether it is their job to do so. * * * Ever since Tony Blair pledged in 1999 to get 50% of young people into university, \u201cwidening participation\u201d has been a political priority. It has more or less been achieved: in 2017, official figures showed that 49% of people in England entered advanced studies by the age of 30. University degrees have become a requirement for many jobs which previously allowed people to start as school-leavers and work their way up. At the same time as access to university was dramatically expanded, spending on public services was slashed: in the decade after the financial crash, day-to-day spending on public services as a share of GDP was at its lowest since the late 1930s. This meant savage cuts to local authorities, schools budgets and NHS mental health provision. Figures released in November 2017 showed that two-thirds of under-18s referred for specialist mental healthcare in England were not receiving treatment, while there had been a 30% fall in hospital beds available for acute mental health conditions since 2009. In search of a cause for the dramatic increase in mental health problems among young people, studies have looked at the impact of social media, or lack of sleep caused by electronic devices, as well as the effects of an uncertain job market, personal debt and constricted public services. In his book Kids These Days: The Making of Millennials, Malcolm Harris argues that far from the stereotype of young people being entitled and narcissistic, millennials are harder working but poorer than their parents\u2019 generation. Harris identifies the pressures of the labour market, rising student debt and a target-driven culture as contributing to steep increases in anxiety and depression among young people. \u201cYoung people feel \u2013 reasonably accurately \u2013 less in control of their lives than ever before,\u201d he writes. With about half of 18-year-olds now going to university, inevitably that population will follow the same patterns as the rest of society. \u201cAnd some of their cases are very complex,\u201d says Steve West, vice-chancellor of the University of the West of England and chair of the mental health working group for Universities UK (UUK), the steering body for British universities. The Office for National Statistics produced a report on England and Wales last year which found that in the past, students were less likely than the general population to commit suicide, and that the recent spike had merely brought them more in line with the rest of the population aged under 24. If universities once provided a respite from the pressures of the world of work, they no longer do. Now they compete with one another for students and the hefty fees they pay. In 1998, universal free higher education ended: fees of \u00a31,000 per year were introduced, and maintenance grants were replaced with loans to be paid back when the student started earning more than \u00a310,000 a year. Since then, costs have risen. In 2006, fees were raised to \u00a33,000 a year. In 2012, this went up to \u00a39,000. In 2017, the cap went up to \u00a39,250, and is expected to keep rising. The average student now leaves university with about \u00a350,000 of debt. \u201cDriving our universities to act like businesses doesn\u2019t just cannibalise the joy of learning and the social utility of research and teaching; it also makes us ill,\u201d wrote Mark Crawford, then a postgraduate student union officer at UCL, in a 2018 piece for Red Pepper magazine. When I spoke to Crawford, he reeled off a list of ways in which university, as it is structured, can worsen student mental health. \u201cIt\u2019s self-worth being reduced to academic outcomes, support services being cut, the massive cost of housing,\u201d he says. When Crawford was working for the UCL student union \u2013 from 2016 to 2018 \u2013 it launched a petition for the university to improve mental health services, which got 2,000 signatures within a week. The campaign drew a direct link between the university\u2019s large overall budgets and its low spending on mental health services. \u201cUniversities enact policies and a structure of learning that encourages poor mental health among students while at the same time underfunding services that could offset the consequences,\u201d Crawford told me. After the students\u2019 campaign, UCL agreed to hire three more counsellors. But the problems cannot all be solved with more counsellors. William Leahy, Brunel\u2019s deputy vice-chancellor, has been closely involved in his university\u2019s efforts to improve mental health support. He points out that starting university might be the first time many students access any kind of psychological help. \u201cWe have seen unbelievable underfunding of secondary schools over many years \u2013 and not just schools but social services, youth clubs, all those services that used to be preventative, they\u2019ve all gone.\u201d This places an extra burden on universities to take on the responsibilities of the health or social services. Successive prime ministers have urged more young people to go to university, with the promise of a better job at the end of it. But given the sluggish state of the economy since the 2008 crash, and the scarcity of graduate-level jobs, the connection is hardly clear. \u201cThe context of stagnating job markets can make university seem like a three-year job application,\u201d says Crawford. Many lecturers I spoke to noted that their students place intense pressure on themselves to get a first-class degree or to take on extra commitments so that they can stand out from the crowd. Some can\u2019t keep it up. Dropout rates have increased every year since 2015, with high fees and lack of support for disadvantaged or troubled students cited as two possible reasons. At the worst affected universities one in five students drop out before the end of their first year. \u201cClearly university and essay writing have always produced stress, but I do think something new has appeared since the fees and debt rose so sharply, which raise the stakes to a whole new level,\u201d says Davies, the Goldsmiths lecturer. \u201cVery few students respond to this as the government would like \u2013 as demanding consumers \u2013 and a large number simply shrink from the situation, or drop out altogether.\u201d * * * Brunel University, on the outer edge of west London, is one institution where the shockwaves of government policy are felt. Built in the 1960s, it has been subject to all the drastic changes the university sector has undergone, but is not part of the elite Russell Group, so its student intake tends to be from a broader range of backgrounds, some with complex needs. Like other universities, it is struggling to deal with increasing mental health problems among students, and in the last few years it has been forced to rethink its mental health provisions, making it easier to access counselling and mentoring, and training lecturers and other staff in mental health first aid. When Sean Cullen started at Brunel in 2014, he knew that he would need support: a serious motorcycle accident during his gap year meant that he could not walk. Before moving on to Brunel\u2019s campus, he discussed wheelchair access with the university. \u201cI was incredibly pleased,\u201d he told me when we met at a bustling coffee shop on campus. \u201cThey had everything in place, so I didn\u2019t need to worry.\u201d He settled into university life, but the same day-to-day pressures that affected most of his peers \u2013 deadlines and money management \u2013 began to feel overwhelming. \u201cIt was a combination of lots of different things at once,\u201d he recalls. \u201cStress of studying, worry about the future. I found myself constantly feeling like I should be doing something, but the thought of doing any of those things made me stay doing nothing.\u201d He tried to access the university counselling service, which at that point was run on a drop-in basis, so he could not make an appointment. There was a long queue and he wasn\u2019t seen. In the end, despairing of seeing a counsellor face to face, he sought support from an online forum. \u201cStudent terms are quite short,\u201d says Lesley O\u2019Keeffe, deputy director of academic and student services at Brunel. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got a four- or five-week waiting list, it might not sound very long, but that\u2019s half a term. The amount of living they can lose in that time is quite significant.\u201d Cullen, now 24, was struck by the contrast in the care he had received for his physical and mental health. \u201cYou can see physical disabilities, so it\u2019s a lot easier to fix the symptoms. You\u2019re in a wheelchair, you can\u2019t climb stairs, so we\u2019ll provide a lift: job done,\u201d he says. \u201cBut if you\u2019ve got anxiety and are struggling to go to classes \u2013 well, there\u2019s no short answer.\u201d A greater number of young people arriving with more complex home situations, who have not managed to get help in the NHS, means that universities are facing a perfect storm. Joyce (not her real name) is 25, a second-year undergraduate student at Brunel. She is studying a science subject, which she likes partly because of the order it represents. \u201cIn life, you come across problems you can\u2019t find a solution for, but when it comes to numbers and data, you normally always find a solution,\u201d she told me when we met at Brunel on a snowy day in January. In her own life, she has often experienced problems with no solution. Joyce, who grew up in London, had an abusive childhood, and is now completely estranged from her family. Undergraduate living has been challenging for her. At first, she moved on to campus, but found it intensely stressful living in halls, in close quarters to people in relationships, couples fighting, flatmates bickering \u2013 all the complications of cohabiting. \u201cMy adult brain had to deal with the childhood stuff that it had locked away,\u201d she says. Now she rents privately in the area. Her living costs are not covered by her termly maintenance loans, so she works several different part time jobs on zero-hours contracts. Added to the daily stress of exams and deadlines, this is a gruelling schedule. \u201cAt the moment, all I do is study and work,\u201d she says. Brunel, like most universities, has a range of social activities \u2013 from club nights to prayer groups. But over the last couple of years, Cullen and the rest of the student union staff have noticed a fall in participation. It\u2019s getting harder to fill up events, most likely a symptom of the sharp increase in students living far away from campus to save money \u2013 over 50% of the student body now commute. Many opt to live with their parents, as much as two or three hours\u2019 drive away, to save money. Others have limited time as they juggle studies with paid work. It is another sign of the pressure weighing on students that they allow themselves less time for fun. * * * Over the last two years, many universities have taken steps to reduce waiting time for counselling, launched courses on managing stress and anxiety, made support services easier to access, and tried to make students more aware of what is available \u2013 although Steve West at UUK acknowledges efforts are \u201cvariable\u201d. Some, including Birmingham University and the London School of Economics, did not have a procedure for dealing with students\u2019 mental health problems as late as last year. Some universities are increasing funding for wellbeing and counselling services: at Bristol, spending doubled from 2016 to 2017. Counselling may be helpful for many people, but it can\u2019t address the stresses built into university life, which can compound mental health problems or create new ones. For Cullen, money worries have been a grinding and ever-present aspect of his university experience. In addition to the \u00a39,000 in tuition fee loans, he has received between \u00a37,000 and \u00a38,000 each year in maintenance loans for living costs. Generally, this just about covers the cost of rent, leaving little to live on. \u201cYou learn fast as a student what\u2019s the bare minimum you can get away with,\u201d he says. In his first year, he socialised more than he does now. But given that a single night out costs as much as a weekly food shop, he soon began to think twice about going out with friends. To complicate matters, the amount he receives from Student Finance England, the body responsible for student loans, changed year by year, with unpredictable amounts and repayment terms. \u201cThe financial aid is getting worse and worse, even though the cost of living is going up,\u201d he says. In 2017, Cullen was elected as the student union\u2019s disability officer. As well as advocating for disabled students, this meant helping with the union\u2019s Advice and Representation Centre, where students can come for advice on housing, mental health and academic or financial problems. He heard accounts of mental health problems from hundreds of other students, many of whose experiences chimed with his own. \u201cI\u2019ve not yet met a student that hasn\u2019t experienced high levels of stress while studying, whether it\u2019s because of deadlines, balancing paid work, or problems with housing,\u201d he says. While many students survive more or less on their overdrafts, Cullen has noticed that many have mental health problems in their final year. \u201cNowadays, getting a degree doesn\u2019t necessarily guarantee you a job, or not a better job than without one,\u201d he says. According to a 2014 report, a significant number of students (45%) do paid part-time work alongside their studies, with 13% doing a 35-hour week. Inevitably, this has an impact not only on academic performance but on students\u2019 ability to fully participate in university life. \u201cWe sometimes get students coming to lectures having just done a night shift, and we can see they\u2019re tired and might not be in the best frame of mind to be learning,\u201d says Michael Thomas, a lecturer in social work at Brunel. Students exhausted from working while studying full time, and still struggling to cover their basic living costs, are bound to be more anxious about deadlines and exams. \u201cIt\u2019s all the environmental stuff that makes it more stressful,\u201d says Thomas. \u201cIf you\u2019re tired, you haven\u2019t had time to study, you have to make a long journey to university, it\u2019s all cumulative.\u201d Some of the more attention-grabbing measures that universities have introduced do nothing to address these fundamental questions. This year Bristol University introduced a course in the science of happiness, a unit that, alongside lectures, will include happiness \u201cexercises\u201d to be practised for a week at a time, such as sleeping more, meditation, savouring enjoyment and performing random acts of kindness. It can count towards a degree. In the past few years, Cambridge, Brunel, London Metropolitan and Warwick, among many others, have organised \u201ctherapy pets\u201d for exam periods \u2013 dogs, cats and guinea pigs that students can pet to ease their stress. To augment overstretched counselling services, many universities run free yoga or mindfulness courses. \u201cOften these measures are being done instead of properly funding mental health services,\u201d says Crawford, the former UCL student. \u201cUniversities are competing for students. Therapy dogs look nice and are cost-effective. It\u2019s insulting.\u201d Even if they are helpful for some people, such measures can only provide short-term relief, as Leahy, the Brunel deputy vice-chancellor, acknowledges. \u201cIn one sense, the system inherently pressurises people, while at the same time you\u2019re saying, \u2018chill out, relax, it\u2019s all fine\u2019.\u201d * * * After the rise in suicides, in 2017 a national strategy was launched by UUK, giving out new guidelines to help universities improve the way they handle mental health. The guidance gave a boost to work that was already being done at Brunel. While two years earlier Cullen had found the system hard to navigate and slow, the process had been improved. \u201cOur waiting lists are better, students can see the right person quicker, or multiple people if that\u2019s what they need,\u201d says O\u2019Keeffe. While Brunel has made a concerted effort to invest in student mental health services and reduce waiting times, across the UK this is patchy. Former health minister and mental health campaigner Norman Lamb recently gathered information from 110 universities, and found that many do not even record their counselling waiting lists or budgets for support services. He told the BBC: \u201cIf we are operating in a fog, if we have no idea how long students are waiting ... this is putting students at risk. We know from the data that the longest waiting times could be over half a term for some students. We know also that there have been some tragedies among some student populations \u2013 students who have taken their own lives. If that happens while they are waiting for support, that\u2019s utterly intolerable.\u201d When Leah (not her real name) started at Brunel in autumn 2018, she thought carefully about disclosing her history of bipolar disorder and anxiety. She was in her mid-30s and had spent much of the previous decade in and out of hospital. She had been sectioned more than once. Brunel, where she is studying for a postgraduate degree, was going to be a new start. \u201cI don\u2019t want to deal with other people\u2019s prejudices as well,\u201d she told me when we met in a quiet room on Brunel\u2019s campus. \u201cI\u2019d rather just be accepted for who I am.\u201d This is not an uncommon dilemma: a key part of the new strategy is for universities to encourage students to disclose that they have a problem. Teachers and staff I interviewed said many of their students worry that telling the university about their condition might adversely affect their degree result. Leah, who rents a flat some distance from the campus, doesn\u2019t talk to her peers about her condition, but she did disclose it to the university. When she started at Brunel, the new strategy for dealing with mental health had been in action for a year, and things went smoothly. She was set up with a counsellor and a mentor, who helps her manage her time and offers practical advice. A few weeks after starting, Leah found herself sitting in the library, completely overwhelmed. Her mind was whirring: had she expected too much of herself by coming back to university? Should she quit? How would she bear the shame of telling her friends and family she couldn\u2019t manage it? She spoke to her mentor, and in a very short space of time they had helped her to switch to a part-time master\u2019s, meaning that her course would be spread over two years rather than completed in one. That also meant she could get a part-time job. Leah\u2019s problems first surfaced when she first went to university. She was younger then, and less sure about what help she needed or was entitled to. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing needing the support, and another being aware that you need it,\u201d she says. Although graduating was a triumph, the following eight years were often harrowing, with Leah in and out of hospital as she struggled to manage her condition. Having decided to return to university, Leah was anxious about how she would cope with the stress \u2013 she likes to keep busy, but stress can trigger manic episodes. But she has been pleasantly surprised. It has actually been easier to access certain kinds of support than it was outside university. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of cuts in the community, and I\u2019ve been on a waiting list for NHS counselling for years now,\u201d she says. At Brunel, she sees a counsellor regularly. When communication between university and health service works, it can provide valuable support. Leah is still supported by a mental health crisis team in her borough. The university is in touch with the team and can inform them if they have concerns about Leah, and vice versa. \u201cNo matter how well put together I am, that vulnerability is still there,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I have a safety net to catch me if anything does go wrong.\u201d Everyone I spoke to in university administration around the country viewed mental health support as part of their duty to students, but they are struggling to meet the need. \u201cWe\u2019re not residential care and we don\u2019t have live-in staff,\u201d says O\u2019Keeffe at Brunel. \u201cSometimes there\u2019s an expectation, even by our local services, that we can do more than we can do. We\u2019re not here to give medical treatment or take the place of the NHS. Our aim is to get everyone to achieve the best they can. Everyone here at some point wanted to get a degree. If that desire is still in them, that\u2019s what we try and work with them for.\u201d Yet even as university mental health provisions slowly improve, the particular stress of university life continues. \u201cAt the end of the day, it doesn\u2019t matter what a counsellor says to you if you can\u2019t afford to pay your rent,\u201d says Crawford. \u201cThe way universities currently operate is manufacturing conditions that create poor mental health. So at the very least, they should invest some resources so that everyone can be seen and supported.\u201d In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

      "bodyText": "The New South Wales government has announced a shake-up to the way it manages the Barwon-Darling river system, including proposed new rules for irrigators that will prevent taking water when the river is low and a rethink on its plans to shrink the Menindee lakes. The draft Barwon-Darling Water resource plan \u2013 the most important set of rules for the Northern Basin of the Murray-Darling \u2013 has been released today. It will now be the subject of consultation. The main change is a proposal to limit the ability of irrigators to take water from the river when it is extremely low. The new rules will protect the river when it falls to around 10% of its normal flows by banning pumping \u2013 even by those who hold the most secure licences. The thresholds for pumping are defined by volumes of water measured at weirs along the river. The Natural Resources Commission has recommended that these should be raised at virtually every weir along the Barwon Darling to protect the river\u2019s health in dry times. \u201cAnalytical modelling suggests the proposed changes to the A-class thresholds will improve flows downstream of Bourke,\u201d the government said in a statement. \u201cThe Barwon Darling will continue to cease to flow in dry times, however the duration of these cease to flow events may decrease.\u201d The government is also flagging compensation and support for a commonwealth buy-back of A-Class Licences. This could see some cotton growers around Bourke choose to sell their water licences under the new rules. The Barwon-Darling Water sharing rules have been extremely controversial as they allow irrigators to pump when the river is extremely low. A Natural Resources Commission (NRC) inquiry blamed the extractions for pushing the Lower Darling into hydrological drought three years early. Two reports into the fish kills last summer at Menindee lakes also pointed to the rules which allowed low flows to be extracted. But the government appears to be edging towards now tightening these rules. \u201cThe NRC has recommended changes to A-Class licence access rules to protect low flows in the Barwon-Darling as part of the water-sharing plan review process,\u201d the government said in its response to the report. \u201cWe will listen to the community\u2019s views on proposed changes to A-Class licence pumping thresholds. It has also said it will be seeking feedback on the NRC\u2019s proposal to abolish the \u201cimminent flow rules\u201d which allowed irrigators to take water when it was forecast to rain. These have only been used twice but were also cited as a major problem in the NRC report. \u201cUntil a decision on this rule is finalised, the minister will not permit the taking of water in these circumstances, as the NRC is of the view that this is likely to cause unacceptable local or downstream impacts,\u201d the government said. The government also said that while it was consulting it would use temporary water restriction orders to protect town water and water for human needs. But it will not all be bad news for irrigators. The NSW government also said it would support the commonwealth government\u2019s buyback of A-Class licences in the system in response to the Vertessy report. There is also likely to be claims for compensation as a result of the changes to the conditions. The NSW government has said the buybacks offer an opportunity for it to have a proper policy on Aboriginal rights to water. \u201cWe will ask the commonwealth to transfer some of this water to Aboriginal ownership for cultural use. We have heard from the communities in Bourke and Wilcannia that they want this water to be left in-stream so that it can flow to Wilcannia,\u201d the government said. The government is also promising to enhance its management of environmental water and will hand management to the environment department instead of having it managed by the industry department, which is largely responsible for water. The government is also planning to greatly increase monitoring of the river and pledged to be guided by the scientific evidence. It will also revisit the objectives of the controversial Menindee Lakes water-saving projectas a result of the highly critical reports. The $150m project would have shrunk the lakes in order to deliver water savings by reducing evaporation. It has been widely criticised by Indigenous groups and people downstream. Meanwhile, the Murray-Darling Basin Authority has urged state governments to \u201cput the pedal to the metal to finish their water resource plans on time\u201d. Its latest progress report shows only six plans have been completed and accredited by the authority. They had been aiming for all plans to be complete by mid 2019. None of NSW\u2019s plans are complete.",

      "bodyText": "Tea drinkers could be getting more than they bargained for in their brew, as a new study has found that a single plastic tea bag can shed billions of particles of microplastics. The researchers from McGill University in Canada have found that when plastic tea bags are steeped in a cup of almost boiling water (95C), the bag releases around 11.6bn microplastics and 3.1bn smaller nanoplastic particles into the cup. This amount is significantly higher than the estimated amount of microplastics particles consumed by a person in an entire year. According to research published earlier this year, the average person eats at least 50,000 particles of microplastic annually and breathes in a similar quantity. The researchers tested four different types of plastic commercial tea bags from shops and caf\u00e9s in Montreal, which were cut open, washed and then steeped in near-boiling water for five minutes before being analysed by electron microscopes and spectroscopy. They found that a single bag released more than 11.6bn microplastics, which was \u201cseveral orders of magnitude higher than plastic loads previously reported in other foods\u201d, according to the study, which was published in the journal of Environmental Science and Technology. Most tea bags are made from natural fibres, though many brands that use natural fibres still contain plastic to seal the bags. Some brands have moved away from paper tea bags toward plastic bags, and it was these plastic bags that the researchers examined. Microplastics are tiny pieces of plastic, which the researchers defined as ranging from 100nm to 5mm in size, which are mostly created by the disintegration of plastic litter. Researchers have found microplastics in the air, soil, rivers and the deepest oceans around the world, as well as in tap and bottled water, seafood and beer. Microplastics were also found in human stool samples for the first time in October. The Canadian team tested the potential toxicity of the microparticles released from the tea bags by exposing water fleas to the contaminated water, finding the particles had behavioural effects and developmental malformations on the fleas. There is no evidence so far that the ingestion of microplastics poses a risk to humans, according the World Health Organisation. But, the United Nations body said more research was needed to fully understand how plastic spreads into the environment and works its way through human bodies. Researchers speculated that the reason for the high number of particles being shed by the tea bags could be due to the fact that the plastic packaging had been in contact with boiling water, as even \u201cfood-grade\u201d plastics may degrade or leach toxic substances when heated above 40 \u00b0C.",

      "bodyText": "The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) has launched a crackdown on textured breast implants following about 100 cases of a rare cancer, including four deaths, in Australia linked to the devices. In a statement, the agency said it would suspend eight types of breast implants \u2013 covering 13% of the Australian market \u2013 from sale for six months while safety and performance concerns are addressed. Un-implanted models will be pulled from the shelves. It comes as medical regulators grapple with concerns about breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL), which has resulted in 23 deaths and more than 700 confirmed cases around the world. Under the new rules, manufacturers will be required to report all cases of the cancer linked to their products within 10 working days. The TGA did not suspend breast tissue expanders, which are mainly used for breast reconstruction surgery, while some micro-textured implants were also not suspended. The agency\u2019s decision to impose new regulations is the result of a review into the breast implants and breast tissues expanders in which it conducted laboratory testing and a full statistical review of all BIA-ALCL cases. The decision to suspend some implant types mirrors the actions of regulators in France and Canada and follows a global investigation by the Guardian and other media organisations that revealed the widespread use of faulty medical implants. In Australia, breast implant sponsors will now be required to provide six monthly reports that include all adverse events and complaints related to its products. After the TGA commenced its review, two industry sponsors also cancelled the supply of their highly textured implants and tissue expanders. It will be illegal to supply, import, or export the suspended implants from 25 October. The regulator said it could revoked the suspensions if \u201cthe devices are addressed to the TGA\u2019s satisfaction\u201d. \u201cIf concerns persist, the suspension may be extended or the entries of the devices may be cancelled,\u201d it said. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In detailed comments on its website, the TGA said the removal of the implants was not required among those who have no symptoms or concerns. \u201cFor women who already have implants, the current consensus of expert opinion is that screening or prophylactic removal in asymptomatic patients is not recommended,\u201d the TGA said. It advised women who detect a change in their breast or armpit, such as swelling, a lump or pain, to consult a doctor. Surgeons should disclose the risk of breast implant-associated ALCL when obtaining informed consent from a patient, the TGA said. The currently available data suggest that the risk might be reduced by using smooth implants. The new regulations were welcomed by the Australian Society of Plastic Surgeons, which described the TGA\u2019s decision as a \u201creasonable outcome\u201d and in line with its own recommendations. \u201cThese actions balance minimising risk for women seeking breast implants, while also ensuring women who require reconstructive surgery following breast cancer aren\u2019t restricted in their options,\u201d the society\u2019s president, Gazi Hussain, said in a statement. \u201cWe have not opposed the suspension of the macro-textured breast implants as emerging data shows these represent the most common association with ALCL. \u201cHowever, we are pleased that micro-textured, grade 2 breast implants remain available to women.

The whistleblower alleges in the explosive complaint that Trump used a phone call with Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to \u201csolicit interference\u201d in the 2020 election, and that the White House then intervened to \u201clock down\u201d the transcript of the call. \u201cIn the course of my official duties, I have received information from multiple US government officials that the president of the United States is using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 US election,\u201d the whistleblower wrote. Several major news organisations are reporting where the whistleblower worked but the whistleblower\u2019s identity has not been publicly disclosed or independently verified by the Guardian. The complaint was released as the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, testified before the House intelligence committee.

According to the whistleblower, in the days following the call, \u201csenior White House officials had intervened to \u2018lock down\u2019 all records of the phone call, especially the official word-for-word transcript of the call that was produced as is customary by the White House Situation Room\u201d. The White House released a memo of the call, but not a verbatim transcript, on Wednesday. Officials were directed by White House lawyers to remove the transcript from the computer system where \u201csuch transcripts are typically stored\u201d, the whistleblower wrote.

We used to handle it a little differently than we do now.\u201d The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, in a press conference in Washington, slammed the White House for allegedly trying to keep details of the Ukraine call from becoming public. \u201cThis is a cover-up,\u201d she said. The complaint suggests other details of other phone calls have been treated in a similar way, raising concerns about other conversations Trump may have had. The complaint, submitted in August, is at the heart of the rolling Trump-Ukraine scandal. The whistleblower said they were \u201cnot a direct witness to most of the events described\u201d. However, they wrote: \u201cI found my colleagues\u2019 accounts of these events to be credible because, in almost all cases, multiple officials recounted fact patterns that were consistent with one another.\u201d In the 25 July call with Zelenskiy, Trump told the Ukrainian president he should work with Trump\u2019s lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and the US attorney general, William Barr, to look into unsubstantiated allegations that Biden, the former vice-president, helped remove a Ukrainian prosecutor investigating his son, Hunter, who was on the board of a Ukrainian gas company. Trump said: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talk about Biden\u2019s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great.\u201d He added: \u201cIt sounds horrible to me.\u201d There is no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden, the current frontrunner for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. The publication of the complaint comes after Pelosi announced an official impeachment inquiry on Tuesday, setting the stage for a rancorous election fight. Congressman Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the intelligence committee, said the log of Trump\u2019s call with Zelenskiy \u201creads like a classic organized crime shakedown\u201d. \u201cIt would be funny, if it weren\u2019t such a graphic betrayal of the president\u2019s oath of office \u2026 it forces us to confront the remedy the founders provided for such a flagrant abuse of office: impeachment.\u201d Devin Nunes, the committee\u2019s top Republican and a fierce Trump ally, accused Democrats of leveling \u201cthe latest information warfare operation against the president\u201d in line with the \u201cRussia hoax\u201d, referring to Robert Mueller\u2019s Trump-Russia investigation. He accused Democrats of digging for \u201cdirt\u201d and even of pursuing \u201cnude pictures of Trump\u201d. In his opening remarks, Maguire offered his rationale for not immediately forwarding the complaint to Congress as required under whistleblower laws. In her press conference, Pelosi accused him of breaking the law. Maguire said his office consulted the White House office of legal counsel and was informed that \u201cmuch of the information in the complaint was in fact subject to executive privilege \u2013 a privilege that I do not have the authority to waive\u201d. He added: \u201cI believe everything here in this matter is totally unprecedented.\u201d He faced sharp questioning from both sides, while trying to dodge partisan points. He insisted: \u201cI believe the whistleblower was acting in good faith \u2026 I think he did the right thing.\u201d Amid mostly fierce Republican attacks on the spy chief and Democrats\u2019 efforts, the GOP congressman Mike Turner said: \u201cI want to say to the president: \u2018This is not OK. That conversation is not OK.\u2019\u201d Maguire said he did not know the identity of the whistleblower. He also contradicted a report in the Washington Post that he threatened to resign if the White House did not allow him to testify freely. The publication has stood by its story.",

Earlier this year, Spratt and the majority of her compatriots riding in the Women\u2019s World Tour gathered in the picturesque ski resort town at the invitation of Cycling Australia.</p> <p>It was an unusual invite. It was not on the eve of a major competition, nor did it bring together a group already selected for a particular race. The gathering had a higher purpose: to consolidate team chemistry and cohesion among a group of riders scattered across different trade teams and various locations.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/26/rohan-dennis-overcomes-demons-to-defend-rainbow-stripes\">Rohan Dennis overcomes demons to defend rainbow stripes | Kieran Pender</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe invited all female Australian riders competing in Europe, to come along, share, learn and be stronger as a group moving forward,\u201d says Brad McGee, head coach of the national road cycling team. \u201cThe intention was simply to bring the athletes together. There was no real agenda about a particular campaign, but we wanted to strengthen those relationships.\u201d</p> <p>For Spratt, already appointed Australia\u2019s lead rider for the 2019 Road World Championships road race <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/sep/29/anna-van-der-breggen-wins-road-world-championships-with-astonishing-ride\">after finishing second last year</a>, the opportunity to spend time with the riders she will rely on in Yorkshire was invaluable. \u201cThe catch-up in Italy was great,\u201d she says. \u201cWe spend so much of the year racing against each other, so to get us all together to hang out \u2013 that was a special feeling.\u201d</p> <p>The team camp in Livigno is Cycling Australia\u2019s latest answer to a vexing question: how do you build a collective ethos among riders that typically spend just one week together in national team colours each year? In a sport where team work matters, and the difference between first and fourth could be a misunderstanding between colleagues at a decisive moment, engendering a sense of common purpose is more important than any marginal gain.</p> <p>\u201cPhysically we\u2019re only together for short periods, but there are many ways to connect individuals during the year to become that team,\u201d says McGee, a veteran of national squads on the track and road during his long professional career. \u201cWe maintain communication through Skype and WhatsApp, and encourage team leaders to stay connected with their likely support riders.\u201d</p> <p>Spratt, her mind set on gold this weekend, has been especially proactive. \u201cOnce the team was announced we had Skype meetings so everyone was clear on their roles,\u201d she says. \u201cWe talked about how, with the riders we have, we can best win this world title, together. That is the focus \u2013 how can we maximise each other\u2019s strengths.\u201d</p> <p>Team selection also plays a big role in building and maintaining team cohesion. \u201cThat can be by selecting some older mentor-type riders that carry the baton for that strong team culture,\u201d says McGee. \u201cOr by leaving riders out that have not been a value-add to that team culture. It is hard to build and very easy to destroy.\u201d</p> <p>When McGee was racing professionally in the early 2000s, close relationships with other Australians in the peloton were inevitable. \u201cIf you go back to my day, the total number of Aussies racing in Europe was low, so there was an automatic connection between us,\u201d he says.</p> <p>But the numerical rise of Australians on the World Tour, dotted across different trade teams, has required Cycling Australia to focus on team cohesion. \u201cThe larger rider base can dilute that connectivity and the awareness of other Aussies \u2013 more is not always better,\u201d McGee says. \u201cWe have to create platforms and initiatives for the riders to bond, so that come world championships or Olympics, we have a connected team ready to deliver.\u201d</p> <p>The proliferation of Australian riders in Europe may have made this task more challenging, but the geographic distance from home does foster a natural bond. \u201cWe appreciate the sacrifices each of us have made to be over here,\u201d says Spratt. \u201cHow far away we are from home, from our support networks \u2013 so we look out for each other.\u201d That, says the rider, gives the Australians a competitive edge. \u201cI think it brings the group a bit closer together than other national teams.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/24/cycling-rain-road-world-championships\">Dygert wins women\u2019s time trial amid Road World Championships rain chaos</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Another advantage in the hunt for glory comes from the establishment of Mitchelton-Scott in 2011. Across the 15 men and women contesting the elite road races for Australia, one third currently ride for the Australian-registered World Tour outfit. Several more have spent time there in the past.</p> <p>\u201cA big part of the effectiveness of the Australian cycling team is down to Mitchelton-Scott,\u201d says McGee. \u201cWhen I make my recommendations to select riders, I am not particularly concerned with which trade team they ride for. But we are very appreciative of the relationship between the Australian road cycling team and Mitchelton-Scott. Their level of commitment is fantastic.\u201d</p> <p>This weekend, both Spratt and the men\u2019s team leader Michael Matthews are genuine contenders to clinch the rainbow jersey. If either succeeds, they will have Cycling Australia\u2019s emphasis on team cohesion to thank. \u201cWhen you have that team feeling and then you pull on the green and gold at worlds,\u201d says Spratt, \u201cyou feel ready to smash yourself for each other.\u201d</p>",

It was an unusual invite. It was not on the eve of a major competition, nor did it bring together a group already selected for a particular race. The gathering had a higher purpose: to consolidate team chemistry and cohesion among a group of riders scattered across different trade teams and various locations. \u201cWe invited all female Australian riders competing in Europe, to come along, share, learn and be stronger as a group moving forward,\u201d says Brad McGee, head coach of the national road cycling team. \u201cThe intention was simply to bring the athletes together. There was no real agenda about a particular campaign, but we wanted to strengthen those relationships.\u201d For Spratt, already appointed Australia\u2019s lead rider for the 2019 Road World Championships road race after finishing second last year, the opportunity to spend time with the riders she will rely on in Yorkshire was invaluable. \u201cThe catch-up in Italy was great,\u201d she says. \u201cWe spend so much of the year racing against each other, so to get us all together to hang out \u2013 that was a special feeling.\u201d The team camp in Livigno is Cycling Australia\u2019s latest answer to a vexing question: how do you build a collective ethos among riders that typically spend just one week together in national team colours each year? In a sport where team work matters, and the difference between first and fourth could be a misunderstanding between colleagues at a decisive moment, engendering a sense of common purpose is more important than any marginal gain. \u201cPhysically we\u2019re only together for short periods, but there are many ways to connect individuals during the year to become that team,\u201d says McGee, a veteran of national squads on the track and road during his long professional career. \u201cWe maintain communication through Skype and WhatsApp, and encourage team leaders to stay connected with their likely support riders.\u201d Spratt, her mind set on gold this weekend, has been especially proactive. \u201cOnce the team was announced we had Skype meetings so everyone was clear on their roles,\u201d she says. \u201cWe talked about how, with the riders we have, we can best win this world title, together. That is the focus \u2013 how can we maximise each other\u2019s strengths.\u201d Team selection also plays a big role in building and maintaining team cohesion. \u201cThat can be by selecting some older mentor-type riders that carry the baton for that strong team culture,\u201d says McGee. \u201cOr by leaving riders out that have not been a value-add to that team culture. It is hard to build and very easy to destroy.\u201d When McGee was racing professionally in the early 2000s, close relationships with other Australians in the peloton were inevitable. \u201cIf you go back to my day, the total number of Aussies racing in Europe was low, so there was an automatic connection between us,\u201d he says. But the numerical rise of Australians on the World Tour, dotted across different trade teams, has required Cycling Australia to focus on team cohesion. \u201cThe larger rider base can dilute that connectivity and the awareness of other Aussies \u2013 more is not always better,\u201d McGee says. \u201cWe have to create platforms and initiatives for the riders to bond, so that come world championships or Olympics, we have a connected team ready to deliver.\u201d The proliferation of Australian riders in Europe may have made this task more challenging, but the geographic distance from home does foster a natural bond. \u201cWe appreciate the sacrifices each of us have made to be over here,\u201d says Spratt. \u201cHow far away we are from home, from our support networks \u2013 so we look out for each other.\u201d That, says the rider, gives the Australians a competitive edge. \u201cI think it brings the group a bit closer together than other national teams.\u201d Another advantage in the hunt for glory comes from the establishment of Mitchelton-Scott in 2011. Across the 15 men and women contesting the elite road races for Australia, one third currently ride for the Australian-registered World Tour outfit. Several more have spent time there in the past. \u201cA big part of the effectiveness of the Australian cycling team is down to Mitchelton-Scott,\u201d says McGee. \u201cWhen I make my recommendations to select riders, I am not particularly concerned with which trade team they ride for. But we are very appreciative of the relationship between the Australian road cycling team and Mitchelton-Scott. Their level of commitment is fantastic.\u201d This weekend, both Spratt and the men\u2019s team leader Michael Matthews are genuine contenders to clinch the rainbow jersey. If either succeeds, they will have Cycling Australia\u2019s emphasis on team cohesion to thank. \u201cWhen you have that team feeling and then you pull on the green and gold at worlds,\u201d says Spratt, \u201cyou feel ready to smash yourself for each other.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Morrison government has \u201cno plans\u201d to override the Australian Capital Territory\u2019s new law legalising possession of cannabis, the health minister Greg Hunt has said. On Friday Hunt and treasurer Josh Frydenberg added to a growing chorus of senior federal ministers criticising the law \u2013 of which home affairs minister Peter Dutton is most vocal \u2013 but held the line against directly overriding it. The attorney general Christian Porter has warned ACT cannabis users may not be protected by the law because of a separate commonwealth offence and has asked for the Australian Federal Police\u2019s advice on how they interact. Hunt told ABC Radio in Melbourne he will leave the legal side of the issue to Porter, but there are \u201cno plans at this stage\u201d to override the ACT law, which would require an act of federal parliament. \u201cOn the health side, I\u2019m very concerned \u2013 we know that the Royal College of Psychiatrists in the UK has directly linked marijuana use to psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia,\u201d he said. Hunt said cannabis had a \u201cvery significant mental health risk\u201d citing the fact frequent users have double the likelihood of schizophrenia, and quadruple for those who started using it before the age of 15. Earlier, Frydenberg said the Morrison government does not support the laws and described drug use as \u201ccriminal behaviour\u201d. Frydenberg said the federal government will \u201creview the laws \u2026 to understand the true impact between the commonwealth laws and the ACT laws\u201d. The ACT laws will allow residents over 18 to possess up to 50 grams and grow two plants. Under existing legislation, people with up to 50 grams or two plants for personal use face fines. If paid within 60 days, they do not appear on a criminal record. However, Porter has warned separate commonwealth offences may still apply and \u2013 if they do \u2013 \u201cthe expectation would be commonwealth laws would be enforced\u201d. The ACT government believes its new laws create a defence for ACT residents who could be charged with a commonwealth offence. The commonwealth director of public prosecutions, Sarah McNaughton, first advised that commonwealth law allowed a defence for people engaged in conduct \u201cjustified or excused\u201d by a state or territory law, but then withdrew her advice citing unspecified \u201clegal complexities\u201d. A spokesman for the CDPP told Guardian Australia the advice was withdrawn \u201cfollowing communications with the attorney-general\u2019s department\u201d and \u201cfurther legal consideration was given to the issues\u201d. \u201cThere has not been detailed judicial consideration of the defence contained in [Commonwealth criminal code section] 313.1 and its potential scope,\u201d he said, explaining why the CDPP could not be definitive about the legal risk to ACT residents.

Linda is a golem sculpted from the memories, \u201clife-moments\u201d, medical records and chat room conversations we leave behind after we die.

      "bodyText": "There\u2019s a recording studio in Melbourne, Australia that\u2019s been filling up with Lindas. On the computer screen, when the Guardian visits, is an early digital Linda prototype, bathed in computer-generated grey waves. A white plaster Linda is serenely meditating in its plastic storage box. And then there\u2019s the final form (for now at least): a silicone mask, with vacant white polystyrene voids in place of eyes. The doppelganger has been created by avant-pop musician and visual artist Becky Freeman, aka Sui Zhen, for her new album Losing, Linda. But while the facsimiles are expressionless, the human from which they are cast is crying. Freeman is talking to me about watching her mother, Yih-Fye, writhe in pain from bedsores and the pancreatic cancer shutting down her internal organs. Tears fall down her cheeks as she describes delicately feeding Yih-Fye ice cubes, and staring into her mum\u2019s medicated eyes in the moment she died. \u201cI think when people try and say, \u2018Oh, they went away peacefully\u2019, it\u2019s more for them. I don\u2019t think any of us know what actually happens for other people when they die,\u201d says Freeman. \u201cYou\u2019re just a body.\u201d These threads of mortality, digitisation and disconnection are woven through Losing, Linda: a collection of songs built around dubbed-out synths, unsettling digital waves and wobbly pop. Her last record Secretly Susan was praised by Pitchfork as \u201cradiating charm and humour\u201d, and for devising a visual world that was \u201cbrilliant and uncanny\u201d. The eponymous Susan was also a doppelganger of sorts: a saccharine caricature of the performative way people present themselves on social media; an amalgam of the surface level data describing how someone wished they appeared. You could say Susan was the absence of depth, and Linda is the absence of surface, as Freeman continues to explore the paucity of online personalities. Linda is a golem sculpted from the memories, \u201clife-moments\u201d, medical records and chat room conversations we leave behind after we die. Linda is a manifestation of how a computer would remember from the scraps and fragments of yourself fed to it over the course of your life. Losing, Linda was recorded in Japan over two artist residencies in Hokkaido and Matsudo. With its technological obsessions and high suicide rates, that country seems a fitting location for what Freeman has created: a kind of haunting Antipodean answer to animated Japanese digital pop star Hatsune Miku (its voice is created with voice synthesising software), or hyper-real PC Music avatar, QT. But rather than trying to create a perfect simulacrum of herself with Linda, Freeman \u2013 who is also a member of Melbourne punk funk band NO ZU \u2013 intends to show the futility and horror of technology attempting to replicate life. \u201c[Linda\u2019s] not really intended to be narcissistic, like wanting to create another me. It\u2019s more to show the failings of that pursuit,\u201d she says. \u201cIf I fed an AI all my data, what would I get? Would I get a version of myself? Or would it be a bit broken?\u201d You can meet Linda online where it will show you dream clips of eggs being stroked (a recurring visual motif in Freeman\u2019s work) in exchange for some short conversation. On stage, the latex version of Linda is performed by Freeman\u2019s sister Jessica and choreographer Megan Payne. Freeman\u2019s creation is named after the online learning channel Lynda, and is intended as an anthropomorphic digital ghost of the disembodied data we leave to float online. \u201cI was [deciding] what to do with all these digital remnants of my mum, and how much of that tells me about her and what\u2019s missing, and not just forget what she was like in person,\u201d says Freeman. She shows me a video of her mum filmed just four months before her death at a dragon boating championship in China (she was a multi-medal winning champion in the sport). She\u2019s skinny and clearly unwell, but also exuberant and vivacious. Freeman says Yih-Fye \u2013 a talented scientist working for healthcare provider B. Braun \u2013 was most at peace hiking in the Blue Mountains and enjoyed taking photos of mushrooms on her phone rather than selfies. Freeman does see the positive aspects of technology (it was through a Facebook group that the weakened Yih-Fye was able to stay connected to friends), and enjoys its creative possibilities \u2013 but she also harbours anxieties. She describes bots hacking her mum\u2019s old Skype account to send her ghostly spam calls; the pressure to accumulate likes and comments on social media posts; and the way platforms like Snapchat and Instagram are both stretching our perception of time while making us hyper aware of every passing second. \u201cThere seems to be value in quantity. Which I don\u2019t necessarily think is a good thing. [Social media has] portioned peoples\u2019 time to the second,\u201d says Freeman, when discussing Instagram stories. \u201cBut who wants to live in a world where you\u2019re aware of 15 seconds?\u201d Losing, Linda isn\u2019t a grief album (that album comes later); rather it helped Freeman to process the trauma of her mother\u2019s death, re-assess her relationship to technology, and remember to cherish the complexity of bodies and life in the physical world \u2013 just as Yih-Fye did. \u2022 Losing, Linda is out now through Remote Control Records. Sui Zhen is touring nationally throughout September, October and November",

Liverpool have forgotten how to lose; a formidable run of form means they have not tasted defeat on these shores since January, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/07/wolves-liverpool-fa-cup-third-round-match-report\">at Wolves in the FA Cup</a>, and with J\u00fcrgen Klopp able to make wholesale changes in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/25/mk-dons-liverpool-carabao-cup-match-report\">victory over MK Dons</a> in midweek, shackling a purring front line of Sadio Man\u00e9, Roberto Firmino and Mo Salah remains a daunting prospect for Chris Wilder\u2019s side.

The club tied down 15 players to new contracts following promotion, as well as the manager, Daniel Farke, but extending the 35-year-old sporting director\u2019s stay last week is perhaps their best move yet. Webber\u2019s work is clear in a Norwich team who travel to Selhurst Park \u2013 where Crystal Palace have been defeated only four times this year \u2013 on Saturday. Webber, who said he plans to leave Norwich at the end of the 2021-22 season, pieced together a title-winning jigsaw, slashing the wage bill and placing an onus on a burgeoning academy. This summer the club\u2019s net spend was \u00a31.4m, half of which they paid for Sam Byram, one of only two permanent signings.

Danny Welbeck scored in that game and S\u00e1nchez Flores may be tempted to throw him into the mix at Molineux. Wolves have had a tricky start to the Premier League season. None of their six games to date have been easily winnable ones. If they do not take three points from this one, though, their season could be a long, painful slog. <strong>GB</strong></p> \n<p>\u2022 Wolves v Watford, Saturday 3pm.</p> \n<h2><strong>10) Newcastle unlikely to \u2018get away with it\u2019 again</strong></h2> \n<p>Newcastle <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/21/newcastle-united-brighton-hove-albion-premier-league-match-report\">picked up a point against Brighton</a> in front of their lowest crowd in the best part of a decade last weekend but it was one they scarcely deserved. Largely outplayed, out-passed and out-thought in a match that will not live long in the memory of anyone unfortunate enough to witness it, only the stunningly acrobatic intervention of Fabian Sch\u00e4r helped them to hang on for a draw. \u201cWe got away with one,\u201d said Steve Bruce, after bemoaning his side\u2019s inability to get the ball from Brighton. Away at Leicester, they are likely to see even less of it and against a side that is more prolific in front of goal than last week\u2019s opposition, they could pay a heavy price.<strong>

      "bodyText": "1) City return to Goodison with a point to prove Pep Guardiola returns to Goodison Park, the site of the worst league defeat of his managerial career, where in January 2017 his Manchester City side had 70.8% of possession, nine shots to their opponents\u2019 five, six corners to their three, and still lost 4-0. \u201cI want us to get better and better and feel we are able to score goals,\u201d Guardiola said afterwards. \u201cWhen that happens we are going to suffer less behind. Our strikers will have more confidence. It is tough for the players, but it is not the first time it\u2019s happened this season.\u201d Indeed it wasn\u2019t: it was the second time in three league games that City had failed to score and lost. This will be their 100th league game since that visit to Goodison Park \u2013 it is fair to say that those strikers have no issues with confidence now. SB \u2022 Everton v Manchester City, Saturday 5.30pm (all times BST) 2) Liverpool hoping to break Bramall Lane hoodoo Liverpool may not have won at Bramall Lane since 1990, having failed to yield victory on their past six visits, but they could not arrive in Yorkshire with a bigger spring in their step. Liverpool have forgotten how to lose; a formidable run of form means they have not tasted defeat on these shores since January, at Wolves in the FA Cup, and with J\u00fcrgen Klopp able to make wholesale changes in victory over MK Dons in midweek, shackling a purring front line of Sadio Man\u00e9, Roberto Firmino and Mo Salah remains a daunting prospect for Chris Wilder\u2019s side. The Sheffield United manager has made it clear his players cannot afford to be \u201cstarry eyed\u201d but acknowledges his three-man defence will be kept busy. \u201cIt might turn into a back 10 or 11,\u201d joked Wilder. \u201cTheir front three is much feted and we\u2019re going to have to have an unbelievably great day to keep the ball out of our net.\u201d BF \u2022 Sheffield United v Liverpool, Saturday 12.30pm 3) A stint in the bottom half looms for Manchester United Manchester United are eighth in the table after six unconvincing games and, if results go against them, they could be as low as 14th by the time they kick off on Monday night. However, it is eminently possible that United will be 10th on Monday, should they lose to Arsenal at Old Trafford. This is remarkable enough on its own \u2013 only once since Alex Ferguson\u2019s first title-winning season in 1992-93, when they were briefly 10th between losing at Aston Villa on 7 November and beating Oldham in their next game, have United been outside the top eight this late in the season: under David Moyes in 2013-14, when they were ninth for a couple of weeks in December. The last time they were in the bottom half at this stage or later was exactly 30 years ago, a mess of a season that United ended in 13th but with a probably managerial career-saving FA Cup win. This is the kind of crisis that most clubs in the country would dream of but for this one would count as a rare old pickle. SB \u2022 Manchester United v Arsenal, Monday 8pm 4) Norwich academy is showing its worth Where will Norwich be at when Stuart Webber elects to walk away in three years\u2019 time? The club tied down 15 players to new contracts following promotion, as well as the manager, Daniel Farke, but extending the 35-year-old sporting director\u2019s stay last week is perhaps their best move yet. Webber\u2019s work is clear in a Norwich team who travel to Selhurst Park \u2013 where Crystal Palace have been defeated only four times this year \u2013 on Saturday. Webber, who said he plans to leave Norwich at the end of the 2021-22 season, pieced together a title-winning jigsaw, slashing the wage bill and placing an onus on a burgeoning academy. This summer the club\u2019s net spend was \u00a31.4m, half of which they paid for Sam Byram, one of only two permanent signings. The major investment was into rewarding those that got them this far, as well as adding to their pool of young talent, namely the England Under-19 midfielder Daniel Adshead from Rochdale.

The next fortnight already feels hugely significant, with a trip to Norwich following Saturday\u2019s home game against Burnley. After the international break they host Brighton, whom they beat in midweek, and then face teams who qualified for Europe last season in six of their next seven matches.

It did not matter, with victory wrapped up, but the concern for Villa is that they remain light on options in the final third. Villa rebuffed plenty of Championship interest to keep hold of Davis as competition for Wesley but, for now, Smith\u2019s shallow pool of strikers remains unconvincing.

Pochettino said it is his job to harmonise a fragmented squad, going on to acknowledge that January and next summer provide the perfect opportunity to iron out the creases; it would be a surprise if any of Christian Eriksen, Danny Rose, Toby Alderweireld or Jan Vertonghen started next season at Spurs, who have gone stale as a result of uncertainty. Another destabilising sub-plot is Pochettino\u2019s own future, with the Argentinian asked to fight on four fronts \u2013 before defeat by Colchester \u2013 with essentially the same squad as last season, but for Tanguy Ndombele.

Danny Welbeck scored in that game and S\u00e1nchez Flores may be tempted to throw him into the mix at Molineux. Wolves have had a tricky start to the Premier League season. None of their six games to date have been easily winnable ones. If they do not take three points from this one, though, their season could be a long, painful slog. GB \u2022 Wolves v Watford, Saturday 3pm. 10) Newcastle unlikely to \u2018get away with it\u2019 again Newcastle picked up a point against Brighton in front of their lowest crowd in the best part of a decade last weekend but it was one they scarcely deserved. Largely outplayed, out-passed and out-thought in a match that will not live long in the memory of anyone unfortunate enough to witness it, only the stunningly acrobatic intervention of Fabian Sch\u00e4r helped them to hang on for a draw. \u201cWe got away with one,\u201d said Steve Bruce, after bemoaning his side\u2019s inability to get the ball from Brighton. Away at Leicester, they are likely to see even less of it and against a side that is more prolific in front of goal than last week\u2019s opposition, they could pay a heavy price.

Morris-Marr alleges that News Corp deliberately chose not to renew her contract after the dispute between her and Bolt: \u201cI was out and Bolt was in.\u201d Bolt has always denied he had anything to do with her departure from the paper. Morris-Marr went on to report on the Pell trial for CNN and the New Daily and, when her book was published last week, it went to the number one spot in the true crime bestsellers on Amazon. Suffer the children Australian media identities lined up to attack the Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg this week for her scathing speech at the UN. From just one mention in the Australian media in September 2018, Thunberg\u2019s prominence has grown to 2,848 mentions this month, according to Streem media monitoring. The more the 16-year-old has been mentioned, the more annoyed some commentators have become. There were the middle-aged white men who threw insults at the climate activist: the Nine footy personality Sam Newman, the broadcaster Alan Jones, the columnist Andrew Bolt, the Australian\u2019s resident climate contrarians Chris Kenny and Graham Lloyd, and the Sky commentator Mark Latham. Then there were the middle-aged white women: the Tele\u2019s Miranda Devine and the Sydney Morning Herald\u2019s Amanda Vanstone. All very predictable. But it was the Nine broadcaster Karl Stefanovic whose intervention was a little surprising. \u201c[Thunberg is] being managed and her stance is being used by activists,\u201d Stefanovic told listeners while filling in as a shock jock on his friend Alan Jones\u2019 radio station 2GB. \u201cShe was very fired up, wasn\u2019t she? I thought, \u2018What are my kids doing on school holidays next week? Not doing that.\u2019\u201d Referring to the former Labor prime minister\u2019s remark that Thunberg \u201crepresents the anger of that generation\u201d, Stefanovic said: \u201cKevin Rudd, give it a rest.

The Australian set the tone for anti-Thunberg sentiment with a front page that screamed: \u201cDeciphering Greta\u2019s gobful.\u201d Inside, the associate editor Chris Kenny described the climate warrior as \u201ca hysterical teenager\u201d while the environment editor, Graham Lloyd, said her speech was \u201cheavy on rhetoric and threats but short on detail and facts\u201d. Lloyd, who spends a great deal of time querying climate science, then analysed with his own take on the truth. In the Herald Sun Bolt said the \u201chysteria\u201d of Thunberg \u2013 and women in general \u2013 was out of control. \u201cThere was Greta Thunberg, the child messiah of global warming, howling at the United Nations this week,\u201d Bolt wrote. \u201cYou have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words \u2026 People are dying. Entire ecosystems are collapsing.\u201d \u201cWe see the same catastrophism here.\u201d Then there was the ex-footballer Newman, who showed his true colours by tagging his post #ClimateChangeHoax. Devine, now enjoying the benefits of working for Rupert Murdoch with a stint in New York at the New York Post, called for someone to be \u201carrested for child abuse\u201d. \u201cIt is grotesque that a child, already emotionally vulnerable due to her condition, has been so indoctrinated by adults,\u201d Devine wrote. To round off the Tele\u2019s coverage its blogger Tim Blair said Thunberg was a \u201cteen climate queen\u201d who had delivered a crazy, absurd and melodramatic speech. Vanstone, in the SMH, said: \u201cThe Thunberg circus has become a complete farce.\u201d Sweet nothings Jones has had a lot to say about Thunberg and the climate change protest, most of which is best forgotten. But he was given acres of space to defend himself in the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age on Friday, papers that are owned by Macquarie Media\u2019s parent company, Nine Entertainment. Nine owns 54.5% of Macquarie and is moving to total ownership. In a friendly interview Jones demonstrated how caring he was to listeners \u2013 he bought $1,000 worth of chocolates from a failing chocolatier \u2013 and how he was not a misogynist: he was \u201cunfailingly courteous to women\u201d. \u201cNow, I don\u2019t run around bullying or shouting at people,\u201d Jones told the paper. \u201cYeah, on air, every so often I\u2019ll get a bit excited but I\u2019m doing a million words a day. I just want people to be sensible and reasonable and balanced.\u201d Lost in the post Speaking of climate change, our readers were a little confused with a post on Facebook, writing their postcodes on the comments on Facebook instead of clicking the link. Fortunately, Guardian Australia\u2019s data editor, Nick Evershed, was on hand to help them out. Hack attack The West Australian published an interview with a young Perth-based hacker who revealed how he had managed to hack entertainment giants including Disney, Intel and Microsoft and get away with it. Dylan Wheeler spoke at length about how he had pulled it all off at the tender age of 14. \u201cI don\u2019t think we had too much of a sense of risk. If we get caught it will be a slap on the wrist, right? \u201cThere was nothing we didn\u2019t have or we couldn\u2019t pivot to and that is where it became a big issue. \u201cIt got so big, it blew up so fast \u2013 we literally had everyone in the gaming industry.\u201d But, according to the podcast newsletter Podnews, the reporter, Tim Clarke, didn\u2019t speak to Wheeler for his full-page profile. \u201cAll 23 quotes with the \u2018hacker\u2019 in question were in a story from Darknet Diaries which was not credited in the piece,\u201d Podnews reported. Soon Wheeler himself had confirmed he\u2019d never spoken to Clarke. The paper\u2019s readers\u2019 editor, Alison Wakeham, told Weekly Beast an error had occurred in the production process. \u201cTim Clarke\u2019s original copy had made it clear that he was quoting from a podcast, but the mistake was introduced when the page was being produced,\u201d Wakeham said. \u201cOn being made aware of what had happened, we corrected the online copy, also adding a link to the podcast, and the digital version of the newspaper.\u201d A huge load of garbage Sometimes reporting on fake news results in the spread of erroneous information even further. Some media reports on the hoax photo claims to show rubbish left behind by Australian climate strikers were so obscure they buried the fact it is a hoax and perpetuated the myth. \u201cThe Australian Youth Coal Coalition called out Sydney\u2019s climate change protesters, sharing this photo \u2013 but they got one detail very wrong,\u201d Seven News wrote on Facebook with the photograph of the rubbish strewn across a park. \u201cPhoto of plastic waste \u2018left behind by Sydney climate protesters\u2019 goes viral.\u201d Only the single quotation marks around the words \u2018left behind by Sydney climate protesters\u2019 gave the reader a clue that the photo is a hoax. In another Facebook post Seven News Australia wrote: \u201cLook at the mess today\u2019s climate protesters left behind in beautiful Hyde Park. So much plastic. So much landfill. So sad.\u201d Then there was the news.com.au story which did not make it clear until the 15th paragraph that the photograph was a hoax. \u201cA climate change photo that has been shared more than 34,000 times has outraged Facebook users,\u201d news.com.au said. \u201cTens of thousands of Australians marched against climate change on Friday \u2014 now one image has gone viral, for all the wrong reasons.\u201d On Monday morning the Sydney radio host Alan Jones also repeated the hoax claim. \u201cWhy did climate protesters leave Sydney\u2019s famous Hyde Park littered with tonnes of waste and plastic bottles?\u201d Jones asked, reading out an ill-informed letter from a listener and failing to correct the record.",

About 1862, having originally landed in Victoria from Wiltshire, England, the brothers moved to the Burdekin River district of Queensland, the new frontier of pastoral expansion and violent dispossession of Indigenous landowners.

Among the (once) revered white pioneers of the Queensland frontier was the odious mayor of Bowen, Korah Halcomb Wills, a ringleader of Indigenous massacres (and a butcher by trade who used his skills to dismember at least one of his Aboriginal victims). A couple of years ago I recounted my disgust at handling, even with gloved hands, the diary in which he recounted butchering an Aboriginal victim and stealing as a trophy a little Aboriginal girl (she later died; he cared more about the death of a horse) who survived one of his massacres. He was a monster in an epoch when monstrous acts of violence against the Indigenous people who resisted rapacious pastoral expansion, sometimes through a passive presence only, were shrugged off as an inevitable, necessary part of frontier life. History heavily implicates the Hanns in extreme frontier violence, too. Which is why, while there is ever a doubt about their complicity, a critical new 48-kilometre stretch of highway (completing an inland Cairns-Melbourne road route that is of great financial benefit to the Queensland pastoral industry) should never be named in their honour. The soon-to-be-sealed Kennedy Development Road between Hughenden and Lynd Junction is already being informally referred to as the \u201cHann Highway\u201d by local, state and federal authorities, and MPs including Bob Katter and Warren Entsch. The regular use of the name \u201cHann Highway\u201d is, it seems, a step towards its official gazettal. The ABC also refers to the \u201cHann Highway\u201d. At a time when governments talk endlessly (often with forked tongue) of reconciliation with Indigenous nations, there is a slow, national movement towards stripping the names of those who massacred and otherwise mistreated Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people from Australia\u2019s public nomenclature. In Victoria, for example, the monikers of Indigenous mass murderers John Batman and Angus McMillan have been erased from federal electorates once named in their honour. Elsewhere there is ongoing pressure to rename landmarks and streets honouring the killers of Indigenous people. There are unresolved suggestions that Mount Wheeler in Queensland, for example, was named after a \u201ccruel and merciless\u201d native police officer, Frederick Wheeler, who killed many Aboriginal people. It is not far from Mount Jim Crow, its etymological origins uncertain despite the clarity of its racist intent. Those names will not linger indefinitely in geography. Streets in Darwin and Alice Springs are, meanwhile, named after William Willshire and Paul Foelsche, murderous policemen who felt Indigenous people were akin to animals. There is ongoing momentum to erase their names from the landscape. In these circumstances it would be unenlightened, retrograde and an insult to many Indigenous people to name a highway after one or both of the Hann brothers. Among the cattle stations established by Frank Hann, who jointly owned other properties with William, was Lawn Hill. Frank Hann worked Lawn Hill with another pastoralist, Melbourne Grammar-educated Jack Watson, who would later inflict the most sadistic violence in lands that would become part of the Northern Territory. In 1882 the pioneering explorer and naturalist Emily \u201cCarrie\u201d Creaghe joined an expedition across the Gulf of Carpentaria from Normanton (Queensland) to Katherine (in today\u2019s Northern Territory). She stopped for a while at Francis Shadforth\u2019s Lilydale (later Riversleigh), a station neighbouring Lawn Hill.
