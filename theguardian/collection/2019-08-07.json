      "bodyText": "The banking royal commissioner, Kenneth Hayne, has delivered a withering criticism of the state of Australian politics, saying trust in governmental and private institutions has been \u201cdamaged or destroyed\u201d. In his first public comments since handing down the royal commission\u2019s findings, Hayne said the country\u2019s \u201copaque\u201d decision-making processes were seen by the public as \u201cskewed, if not captured\u201d by powerful vested interests, while leaders were \u201cunable to conduct reasoned debates about policy matters\u201d. Instead, Hayne said, they resorted to the \u201clanguage of war\u201d and sought to \u201cportray opposing views as presenting existential threats to society as we now know it\u201d. \u201cReasoned debates about issues of policy are now rare,\u201d he said. \u201cThree- or four-word slogans have taken their place.\u201d Hayne, a former high court judge, made the comments in a speech in July that was only published on Wednesday. His royal commission is among several that have been established in recent years. At the federal level, a royal commission into aged care is now under way and the Morrison government has also established another into abuse in the disability sector. \u201cNotice how many recent inquiries relate to difficult issues of public policy: how can we, how should we, look after the aged? How can we, how should we, respond to mental health?\u201d Hayne said. \u201cSome are more particular. Has the course of criminal justice been deflected by the way in which a lawyer provided information to police? \u201cDoes reference of matters of these kinds to royal commissions suggest that our governmental structures can deal effectively only with the immediate spot fire and cannot deal with large issues?\u201d And he warned that the trend should not be \u201cdismissed as some passing fad or fashion\u201d. \u201cInstead, we need to grapple closely with what these calls are telling us about the state of our democratic institutions,\u201d Hayne said. \u201cTrust in all sorts of institutions, governmental and private, has been damaged or destroyed.\u201d In a speech which criticised all sides of politics for what he viewed as increasingly partisan rhetoric, Hayne singled out debate around the Uluru Statement as an example of the declining standards of public discourse. Hayne argued that public debates proceeded by \u201creference only to slogans coined by partisan participants\u201d. \u201cWe have seen that in this country in the debate about the Uluru Statement from the Heart,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have seen that in the United States in the debate about the Mueller report. The examples can be multiplied.\u201d Opponents of the proposal for constitutional recognition have sought to incorrectly portray the call for a voice to parliament as a \u201cthird chamber\u201d. The former deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, recently apologised for using this description of the proposal, admitting he was wrong. In an apparent shot at the media, Hayne also said that \u201ccommentary focuses on what divides us, rather than what unites us\u201d. Hayne\u2019s final report into the banking sector was handed down in February. He made 76 recommendations.",

      "bodyText": "Almost 67,000 new cases of asthma in children across 18 European countries could be prevented every year if levels of tiny particulates polluting the air are cut to recommended levels, research suggests. The study joins a growing body of research into the impact of air pollution on human health. A landmark study published in April estimated that 4m new asthma cases a year globally among those aged one to 18 were down to levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in the air. The latest study, which focused on asthma diagnoses among children aged one to 14, looked at components of toxic air including fine particulate matter known as PM2.5 as well as NO2, both of which are released by road vehicles and sources. \u201cA considerable proportion of childhood asthma is actually caused by air pollution, particularly PM2.5,\u201d said Dr Mark Nieuwenhuijsen, from the Barcelona Institute of Global Health (ISGlobal) and a co-author of the research. The study shows thousands of new cases of asthma could be prevented each year by adhering to guidelines set by the World Health Organization (WHO), but Nieuwenhuijsen and his colleagues write that there is more to do. Evidence suggests there is no threshold level when it comes to the impact of air pollution on health, they say. Writing in the European Respiratory Journal, the team describe how they focused their study on 18 European countries, including France, Denmark, Spain, and the UK. They used a range of data including national-level figures for childhood asthma incidence, estimates of the distribution of children across the countries and the levels of pollution they are exposed to. In total the team\u2019s estimates encompassed more than 63.4 million children. According to WHO guidelines, levels of PM2.5 should not exceed an annual average of 10 \u03bcg/m3, and levels of NO2 should not exceed an annual average of 40 \u03bcg/m3. The new study suggests that, if the 18 countries in the study were to stay within these limits for PM2.5, 66,600 new cases of childhood asthma, accounting for 11% of new diagnoses, would be prevented each year, about 10,400 of which would be in the UK. Around 2,400 new cases would be prevented each year across the 18 countries if WHO limits for NO2 were not exceeded. The team found even greater effects when they set air pollution levels to the lowest ever recorded in studies \u2013 a sort of \u201cbackground measure\u201d which was recorded in Germany for PM2.5 and in Norway for NO2. The estimates suggest a third of new childhood asthma cases \u2013 around 190,000 a year \u2013 would be prevented if PM2.5 fell to such levels across the 18 countries, and 23% of cases would be prevented if NO2 was reduced to its lowest recorded levels. \u201cIt is not really realistic at the moment to get down to these levels, but it just gives an [estimate of] how many cases actually may be attributable to [these pollutants],\u201d Nieuwenhuijsen said. \u201cWhat is clear from our analysis is that current WHO standards are not strict enough to protect against many cases of childhood asthma,\u201d he said, noting WHO guidelines were currently under review. Prof Stephen Holgate, a special adviser on air quality for the Royal College of Physicians, said the study showed meeting WHO air pollution limits would create a \u201cmassive health gain\u201d. \u201cThis groundbreaking study confirms the massive impact that air pollution has on childhood asthma, not only in making it worse in those who already suffer, but initiating new asthma,\u201d he said, adding that the UK had one of the highest prevalences of asthma worldwide.\u201d Dr Susan Anenberg from George Washington University, a co-author of the global study published in April, said the latest research was another indication of the damage air pollution could do to public health. \u201cAlmost no one on planet Earth breathes clean air,\u201d she said. \u201cThe good news is that there are many ways to prevent children from getting asthma because of their air pollution exposure.

There is a slight rattle as you traverse this mineral mat, and a subtle bounce created by fellow walkers, both of which add a frisson to crossing the 2.5-metre-wide deck 60 metres above the sea.

The number of amphora fragments found at the site, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jul/13/tintagel-excavations-reveal-refined-tastes-of-medieval-settlers\">indicating vast quantities of wine and olive oil brought from across the Mediterranean</a>, far exceeds the number found at sites across the rest of Britain combined, while excavations suggest Tintagel was larger than London in the same period. \u201cWhat really rankles Cornish people,\u201d adds Weatherhill, \u201cis the fact they\u2019re marketing the site as \u2018English\u2019 Heritage, when the English have had nothing to do with it.\u201d</p> <p>Butters defends the accusations of commercialisation, which have been more vocally levelled at English Heritage since it became an independent charity in 2014 and forced to cover its own costs (the bridge was part-funded by a \u00a32.5m donation from Tetra Pak billionaires Hans and Julia Rausing). A family ticket to Tintagel now costs \u00a333.80, while <a href=\"https://www.english-heritageshop.org.uk/gift-ideas/gifts-from-tintagel-castle\">the gift shop</a> sells a Sword in the Stone letter-opener for \u00a340 and a model of the Knights of the Round Table for \u00a3120.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to make money to look after our heritage,\u201d says Butters. \u201cAnd it\u2019s very important that we\u2019re not snobbish and elitist about it. We must spark the interest of the next generation in these sites, because if people don\u2019t care about them, they won\u2019t be preserved.\u201d</p> <p>You could argue that there has been a slightly tacky side to Tintagel ever since Tennyson fuelled the Arthurian hype with his <a href=\"https://kimberlyevemusings.blogspot.com/2015/03/alfred-tennysons-thoughts-on-idylls-of.html\">Idylls of the King</a>, and the railway arrived at nearby Camelford, spawning such heady visions as the Victorian pile of the Camelot Castle Hotel and the 1930s fantasy of <a href=\"http://www.kingarthursgreathalls.co.uk/\">King Arthur\u2019s Great Halls</a>. Amid the surrounding jamboree of legends, the sleek new bridge is a carefully judged arrival.</p>",

Now, with timed tickets in hand, tourists will be able to flow across the bridge\u2019s elegant 70 metre deck of local slate tiles, which have been packed together on their sides without mortar, creating the effect of walking across a box of After Eight mints. There is a slight rattle as you traverse this mineral mat, and a subtle bounce created by fellow walkers, both of which add a frisson to crossing the 2.5-metre-wide deck 60 metres above the sea. There are nice details \u2013 thin slices of quartz embedded in the slate as well as raw oak handrails \u2013 giving it a hand-crafted quality in tune with the historic setting, and making it unlike most modern technocratic footbridges. The polished steel balustrade can look a bit too bling as it glints in the sun, and the arrival of this shiny new structure hasn\u2019t been to everyone\u2019s liking. To some, it smacks of the \u201cDisneyfication\u201d of the site in the hands of English Heritage, which has been accused of turning the location into a \u201ccash cow theme park\u201d by campaign group Kernow Matters To Us (Kernow is Cornish for Cornwall). Hackles were raised in 2016 when an 8ft high bronze statue of a cloaked figure with a sword was unveiled on the island, shortly after a relief of Merlin\u2019s face was sculpted into the cliffs below \u2013 an unthinkable act in the eyes of some critics, akin to carving the face of a druid into Stonehenge. \u201cThe bridge is just the latest English Heritage vanity project,\u201d says Cornish archaeologist and historian Craig Weatherhill. \u201cIt continues the cheap and nasty theme park approach, ruining the ambience of the site.\u201d Weatherhill and his fellow campaigners think the focus on Arthurian legend is a distraction from the real history of Tintagel, the seat of the kings of Dumnonia, a powerful empire that stretched across Cornwall and Devon from the 5th to the 7th centuries. The number of amphora fragments found at the site, indicating vast quantities of wine and olive oil brought from across the Mediterranean, far exceeds the number found at sites across the rest of Britain combined, while excavations suggest Tintagel was larger than London in the same period. \u201cWhat really rankles Cornish people,\u201d adds Weatherhill, \u201cis the fact they\u2019re marketing the site as \u2018English\u2019 Heritage, when the English have had nothing to do with it.\u201d Butters defends the accusations of commercialisation, which have been more vocally levelled at English Heritage since it became an independent charity in 2014 and forced to cover its own costs (the bridge was part-funded by a \u00a32.5m donation from Tetra Pak billionaires Hans and Julia Rausing). A family ticket to Tintagel now costs \u00a333.80, while the gift shop sells a Sword in the Stone letter-opener for \u00a340 and a model of the Knights of the Round Table for \u00a3120. \u201cWe need to make money to look after our heritage,\u201d says Butters. \u201cAnd it\u2019s very important that we\u2019re not snobbish and elitist about it. We must spark the interest of the next generation in these sites, because if people don\u2019t care about them, they won\u2019t be preserved.\u201d You could argue that there has been a slightly tacky side to Tintagel ever since Tennyson fuelled the Arthurian hype with his Idylls of the King, and the railway arrived at nearby Camelford, spawning such heady visions as the Victorian pile of the Camelot Castle Hotel and the 1930s fantasy of King Arthur\u2019s Great Halls. Amid the surrounding jamboree of legends, the sleek new bridge is a carefully judged arrival.",

Ministers are considering the proposal.</p> <p>But a report by the House of Lords <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/lords-select/science-and-technology-committee/\">science and technology committee</a> said the recommendation should be implemented only if the government was prepared to fully compensate universities with additional teaching grants. Otherwise, the report said, institutions would have to take money away from research to subsidise teaching, with \u201cdevastating\u201d consequences.</p> <p>The report highlighted a long-term deficit in research funding. It said quality-related (QR) funding, which forms the bedrock of research funding for universities, had fallen 12.8% in real terms since 2010 and said the government should commit to increasing QR funding each year by at least the rate of inflation.</p> <p>The committee\u2019s chair, Narendra Patel, said \u201cThe Augar review has completely missed the mark by not considering research funding in its review. By ignoring research and cross-subsidies, it has made recommendations which, if implemented, could prove harmful to the already challenging ecosystem of university funding.\u201d</p> <p>There has been growing concern in recent months about the financial health of some higher education institutions. According to recent analysis, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/mar/21/england-universities-in-deficit-figures-financial-pressure\">nearly one in four</a> universities in England were in deficit last year. The number of universities in England with operating deficits in 2017/18 increased to 32, compared with 24 the year before and 10 in 2015/16.</p> <p>The Lords committee said any further funding shortfall would make the situation in universities unmanageable. \u201cThe immediate casualties will likely be widening-participation programmes, student experience, infrastructure maintenance and repair, and the hands-on elements of courses,\u201d Lord Patel said. \u201cWithout adequate research funding, the consequences for the UK will be devastating and the UK risks falling behind other countries.\u201d</p> <p>Universities are bracing for the impact of Brexit. The Lords report said the government after Brexit should match in full the level of funding the UK currently receives from the EU.</p> <p>\u201cThe UK will not reach its target of investing 2.4% of GDP in research and development by 2027 unless funding for research in universities is secured and the UK can attract researchers from overseas,\u201d the report concluded. \u201cWe recommend that the government ensures that its post-Brexit immigration laws do not hinder the ability of UK universities to recruit and retain researchers.\u201d</p> <p>A government spokesperson said: \u201cAs part of our ongoing review of post-18 education and funding we will be responding to Philip Augar\u2019s recommendations in due course. We have committed an additional \u00a37bn for research and development by 2022, the largest increase since records began.\u201d</p>",

Otherwise, the report said, institutions would have to take money away from research to subsidise teaching, with \u201cdevastating\u201d consequences. The report highlighted a long-term deficit in research funding. It said quality-related (QR) funding, which forms the bedrock of research funding for universities, had fallen 12.8% in real terms since 2010 and said the government should commit to increasing QR funding each year by at least the rate of inflation. The committee\u2019s chair, Narendra Patel, said \u201cThe Augar review has completely missed the mark by not considering research funding in its review. By ignoring research and cross-subsidies, it has made recommendations which, if implemented, could prove harmful to the already challenging ecosystem of university funding.\u201d There has been growing concern in recent months about the financial health of some higher education institutions. According to recent analysis, nearly one in four universities in England were in deficit last year. The number of universities in England with operating deficits in 2017/18 increased to 32, compared with 24 the year before and 10 in 2015/16. The Lords committee said any further funding shortfall would make the situation in universities unmanageable. \u201cThe immediate casualties will likely be widening-participation programmes, student experience, infrastructure maintenance and repair, and the hands-on elements of courses,\u201d Lord Patel said. \u201cWithout adequate research funding, the consequences for the UK will be devastating and the UK risks falling behind other countries.\u201d Universities are bracing for the impact of Brexit. The Lords report said the government after Brexit should match in full the level of funding the UK currently receives from the EU. \u201cThe UK will not reach its target of investing 2.4% of GDP in research and development by 2027 unless funding for research in universities is secured and the UK can attract researchers from overseas,\u201d the report concluded. \u201cWe recommend that the government ensures that its post-Brexit immigration laws do not hinder the ability of UK universities to recruit and retain researchers.\u201d A government spokesperson said: \u201cAs part of our ongoing review of post-18 education and funding we will be responding to Philip Augar\u2019s recommendations in due course. We have committed an additional \u00a37bn for research and development by 2022, the largest increase since records began.\u201d",

On a busy penultimate day of the transfer window Spurs finally struck a deal for the Argentina midfielder Lo Celso after failing with attempts to sign Philippe Coutinho on loan from Barcelona, although a move for the Juventus striker Paulo Dybala also appeared unlikely to materialise broke down after the Juventus forward requested a salary of \u00a3350,000 a week. While Lo Celso has yet to agree personal terms, he is expected to move to north London after being withdrawn from the Betis squad for the friendly against Las Palmas on Wednesday evening and is expected in London on Thursday for a medical. The fee for the former Paris Saint-Germain player would match the amount Tottenham paid for Tanguy Ndombele at the start of July, with Pochettino having urged his chairman, Daniel Levy, to back him in the transfer market having reached the Champions League final last season. His request appears to have been granted, with the manager also keen on signing the England Under-21 international Sessegnon before the deadline passes. Negotiations with Fulham have dragged on all summer, with the Championship side having held out for a fee of nearly \u00a330m despite Sessegnon having only one year of his contract remaining. England Under-20 World Cup winner Josh Onamha is likley to go to Craven Cottage as part of the deal having spent last season on loan at Sheffield Wednesday.

Ambitious attempts to sign a second Argentina international in the form of Dybala have been frustrated by the same issues which confronted Manchester United in their attempt to sign the 25-year-old last week. As well as wage demands that would make him by far the club\u2019s highest earner, complications relating to Dybala\u2019s image rights \u2013 which are owned by his former agent Pierpaolo Triulzi \u2013 have caused those close to the deal to state it would take \u201csomething miraculous\u201d to complete the deal before the deadline.

      "body": "<p>As doubts continue to linger over Jack Nowell\u2019s fitness for the World Cup, Eddie Jones has the brutal honesty of Anthony Watson\u2019s father to thank for ensuring his wing ranks are not further depleted. Nowell\u2019s place on the plane to Japan remains in jeopardy but Watson is back to full fitness and looks set for his first England appearance in 18 months this weekend after his father Duncan\u2019s \u201ckick up the backside\u201d during his lengthy injury lay-off.</p> <p>Watson tore his achilles at the end of the 2018 Six Nations and needed surgery a second time after rupturing it again four months later during an NFL photoshoot. A niggling quad injury further delayed his comeback until April but, after three appearances for Bath, Jones saw fit to include the 25-year-old in his World Cup plans in June. Doubts were raised when Jones then sent him for a week\u2019s conditioning in Loughborough with the sprint coach Jonas Dodoo last month while the rest of the squad gathered in Bristol but, after returning for the recent camp in Treviso, he is set to face Wales in England\u2019s first World Cup warm-up match on Sunday.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/06/england-world-cup-wales-eddie-jones-ben-teo-mike-brown\">Ben Te\u2019o left out of England squad to face Wales in World Cup warm-up</a> </p> </aside>  <p>All going well at Twickenham, he seems sure to be named in Jones\u2019s final 31-man World Cup squad on Monday but Watson admitted Japan could have been beyond him without a few home truths via text message. \u201cThere were a few days, over the 13 months ... I had two or three days where I was particularly like \u2018this is a nightmare\u2019,\u201d said Watson. \u201cBut I think the quicker you can snap out of those days, snap out of those moods and try to focus on what you\u2019re trying to achieve, then the better you are for it.</p> <p>\u201cI texted my dad saying I was struggling and he just replied, \u2018Mate, you\u2019ve got to get on with it or you\u2019ll never play rugby again,\u2019 and I was just like \u2018Wow, you can never hit more home than that.\u2019 It\u2019s so black and white but it\u2019s so true, if you really want to play rugby again you\u2019ve got to do everything you can to get back playing rugby again.

Equally so is just how much Jones will want him at his disposal in Japan. The 2003 World Cup winner Jason Robinson was at England\u2019s hotel on Wednesday, offering a timely reminder that in terms of devastating footwork Watson is the closest among the current crop by way of comparison.</p> <p>But is he as quick as he was before injury struck? \u201cEveryone wants to know the stats, don\u2019t they? Yeah, I can safely that they\u2019re close to that, if not there. I\u2019d definitely like to improve still. That week I had with Jonas away from camp was hugely beneficial for me. I came back feeling a lot better. It was slow progress. With an achilles it\u2019s very variable, so it was just dealing with those days when you thought it was all going so smoothly and when it\u2019s not going so smoothly.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/05/jamie-george-england-wales\">\u2018There\u2019s a belief that we can do something special,\u2019 says Jamie George</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Watson waxes lyrical about Dodoo having decided that, so early into his comeback when Bath\u2019s season came to an end, he ought to undertake a three-week training programme with the coach who lists the Olympic gold medallist Greg Rutherford among his previous clients, before joining up with England.

      "bodyText": "As doubts continue to linger over Jack Nowell\u2019s fitness for the World Cup, Eddie Jones has the brutal honesty of Anthony Watson\u2019s father to thank for ensuring his wing ranks are not further depleted. Nowell\u2019s place on the plane to Japan remains in jeopardy but Watson is back to full fitness and looks set for his first England appearance in 18 months this weekend after his father Duncan\u2019s \u201ckick up the backside\u201d during his lengthy injury lay-off. Watson tore his achilles at the end of the 2018 Six Nations and needed surgery a second time after rupturing it again four months later during an NFL photoshoot. A niggling quad injury further delayed his comeback until April but, after three appearances for Bath, Jones saw fit to include the 25-year-old in his World Cup plans in June. Doubts were raised when Jones then sent him for a week\u2019s conditioning in Loughborough with the sprint coach Jonas Dodoo last month while the rest of the squad gathered in Bristol but, after returning for the recent camp in Treviso, he is set to face Wales in England\u2019s first World Cup warm-up match on Sunday. All going well at Twickenham, he seems sure to be named in Jones\u2019s final 31-man World Cup squad on Monday but Watson admitted Japan could have been beyond him without a few home truths via text message. \u201cThere were a few days, over the 13 months ... I had two or three days where I was particularly like \u2018this is a nightmare\u2019,\u201d said Watson. \u201cBut I think the quicker you can snap out of those days, snap out of those moods and try to focus on what you\u2019re trying to achieve, then the better you are for it. \u201cI texted my dad saying I was struggling and he just replied, \u2018Mate, you\u2019ve got to get on with it or you\u2019ll never play rugby again,\u2019 and I was just like \u2018Wow, you can never hit more home than that.\u2019 It\u2019s so black and white but it\u2019s so true, if you really want to play rugby again you\u2019ve got to do everything you can to get back playing rugby again. You can\u2019t just sit and mope around. That was a real kick up the backside.\u201d It was not Watson\u2019s first long-term injury lay-off, having been sidelined with a broken jaw and debilitating hamstring injury in recent years, but his struggles during his recovery are nonetheless entirely understandable. Equally so is just how much Jones will want him at his disposal in Japan. The 2003 World Cup winner Jason Robinson was at England\u2019s hotel on Wednesday, offering a timely reminder that in terms of devastating footwork Watson is the closest among the current crop by way of comparison. But is he as quick as he was before injury struck? \u201cEveryone wants to know the stats, don\u2019t they? Yeah, I can safely that they\u2019re close to that, if not there. I\u2019d definitely like to improve still. That week I had with Jonas away from camp was hugely beneficial for me. I came back feeling a lot better. It was slow progress. With an achilles it\u2019s very variable, so it was just dealing with those days when you thought it was all going so smoothly and when it\u2019s not going so smoothly.\u201d Watson waxes lyrical about Dodoo having decided that, so early into his comeback when Bath\u2019s season came to an end, he ought to undertake a three-week training programme with the coach who lists the Olympic gold medallist Greg Rutherford among his previous clients, before joining up with England. When asked to do so again last month, however, Watson feared the worst. \u201cAt first I was a bit sketchy, not being with the lads was definitely sketchy but when I had it explained to me why I was going up there and what it was for, and then on the back of the week ... I didn\u2019t see it right at the start it was definitely the best thing that could have happened. [Jonas] just explains running in a fascinating way.

      "bodyText": "Rebel MPs are working on a plan to thwart Boris Johnson in pursuing a no-deal Brexit on 31 October that involves forcing parliament to sit through the autumn recess, amid growing outrage about the power and influence of his controversial aide Dominic Cummings. The cross-party group of MPs is looking at legislative options with mounting urgency because of the hardline tactics of Cummings, who one Conservative insider described as running a \u201creign of terror\u201d in No 10 aimed at achieving Brexit on 31 October at any cost. Three MPs have told the Guardian that one method under discussion is for members to amend the motion needed for parliament to break for party conferences in mid-September. This could give MPs another three weeks of sitting time to stop a no-deal Brexit and potentially open the door for days to be set aside for rebels to control parliamentary business. The ultimate aim would be to pass a bill forcing the government to request an extension to article 50 from Brussels. Since joining Johnson\u2019s administration, Cummings has told government advisers that No 10 stands ready to do whatever is necessary to bring about Brexit on 31 October \u2013 deal or no deal. This could include proroguing parliament, or ignoring the result of any no-confidence vote in Johnson and calling a \u201cpeople v politicians\u201d general election \u2013 to be held after the UK had left the EU. However, it is understood that alarm is mounting within No 10, among some special advisers and Tory MPs about the scale of Cummings\u2019 influence and willingness to defy parliament. One Conservative insider said that Cummings had in effect demanded control over Johnson\u2019s operation as his price for entering government and proceeded to sideline more moderate advisers, such as ex-City Hall stalwart Sir Eddie Lister, while installing a team of \u201ctrue believers\u201d in hard Brexit largely from the former Vote Leave campaign. The source described Cummings\u2019 grip over No 10 as a \u201creign of terror\u201d, with advisers petrified about keeping their jobs and being told they are expected to be working flat-out to deliver Brexit by the 31 October deadline, come what may. Lister was initially briefed to the media as Johnson\u2019s newly appointed chief of staff and is described by some inside Downing Street as one of \u201cthe sensibles\u201d. But an internal No 10 email shows that Cummings is now styled as \u201cassistant to the prime minister\u201d in charge of Brexit and domestic policy, while Lister has been downgraded to \u201cchief strategic adviser\u201d responsible for foreign affairs, business and security. A Tory special adviser told the Guardian that Cummings was \u201cabsolutely running the show\u201d and was even more ruthless and difficult to work with than Theresa May\u2019s former advisers Nick Timothy and Fiona Hill: \u201cThe level of terror is greater than Priti Patel would like to exert on the criminal classes. It is far, far scarier than under Nick Timothy. He is two Fionas plus a Nick rolled into one. It\u2019s the worst of both worlds in one person.\u201d Cummings does have some supporters, including one special adviser who worked under the last two administrations, who said: \u201cDom wants people who can do the job well, will actually deliver on the PM\u2019s priorities and will give honest answers when there are problems.

John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, told an audience in Edinburgh that if Johnson lost a confidence vote then Corbyn would seek to form a caretaker government instead, with the support of other opposition parties and rebel Conservative MPs. If the Conservative leader failed to quit, McDonnell quipped that he would not \u201cwant to drag the Queen into this but [he] would be sending Jeremy Corbyn in a cab to Buckingham Palace to say \u2018we\u2019re taking over\u2019\u201d. However, rebel Conservative MPs would be extremely wary about a plan that installed Corbyn as even a temporary prime minister and many prefer the option of legislation to block no-deal rather than a vote to collapse the government. Peter Kyle, a Labour MP who led a compromise plan to put any deal to a second referendum, said he was completely confident that any plans by Johnson and Cummings to push through no deal against the will of parliament could be stopped. \u201cOf course we can decide to sit through recess.

      "body": "<p>The Kitchen, a late summer, female-led adaptation of a little-known DC comic, is the worst kind of bad movie.</p> <p>That\u2019s because it has all the ingredients of a <em>good</em> movie, from a juicy premise to a stellar cast, yet it\u2019s assembled with such staggering incompetency that from the very first scene it boils over into one star territory, all promise evaporating from the screen. The boredom and confusion that then follows is backgrounded by an almost angry frustration that someone could get something so potentially thrilling so very, very wrong.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/25/after-the-wedding-review-sundance-film-festival-julianne-moore-and-michelle-williams\">After the Wedding review \u2013 Julianne Moore and Michelle Williams lift confused melodrama</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That someone would seem to be Andrea Berloff, the Oscar-nominated co-writer of Straight Outta Compton, who here makes her directorial debut while also singlehandedly writing the script. It\u2019s refreshing to see a woman given the reins of a female-fronted DC project, given how it remains such a boys\u2019 club but it\u2019s then disheartening to see what an utter mess she makes of it, both with her risible dialogue and scrappy direction. She throws us into 70s New York with a swirling nighttime shot of the city and It\u2019s a Man\u2019s Man\u2019s Man\u2019s World clunkily explaining the overarching theme of the movie. In Hell\u2019s Kitchen at the time, crime is a man\u2019s business but when their gangster husbands get thrown in jail, it\u2019s up to the wives to step in. Kathy (Melissa McCarthy), Ruby (Tiffany Haddish) and Claire (Elisabeth Moss) aren\u2019t natural criminals but financial circumstances dictate that they need to do <em>something</em> and it doesn\u2019t take long for them to realise they\u2019re a better fit than they might have imagined.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmxbpwg0rU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gOmxbpwg0rU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>There are inevitable echoes of Steve McQueen\u2019s electric thriller <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/sep/09/widows-review-steve-mcqueen-dazzles-with-masterful-thriller\">Widows</a>, given the set-up, and it\u2019s a comparison which harms The Kitchen in every conceivable way. While McQueen\u2019s film delivered both sharp, impactful action and believably wrought female characters, Berloff\u2019s chucks in three astonishingly underwritten women and coerces them through one confusingly plotted situation to the next. There\u2019s a rhythm that feels off from the start, like hearing a song at the wrong speed or watching a percussion section fail to follow a beat. Scenes either end too soon or go on too long, fights are confusingly choreographed, reaction shots are strangely chosen, editing is baffling \u2013 it\u2019s a swirling pot of bad decisions leading to an end dish that\u2019s both undercooked and overheated. It wreaks of studio interference, a film that feels pulled apart and then haphazardly restitched in an editing suite by a committee of people desperate to get it released before swiftly moving on and all agreeing to never speak of it ever again.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9236c57805e596ff23b0c3e18c49987897b52575\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9236c57805e596ff23b0c3e18c49987897b52575/0_0_5280_3528/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elisabeth Moss in The Kitchen.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elisabeth Moss in The Kitchen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alison Cohen Rosa/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tonally, Berloff can\u2019t decide between broad cartoonish mayhem or gritty Scorsese-lite drama and instead veers maniacally between the two which means her garish excesses and paper-thin characters are often forced into awkward hard-edged solemnity. So much of the film clashes against itself, including, sadly, her cast who can\u2019t quite sell themselves in territory they\u2019re not usually found in. McCarthy, who delivered such an exquisite dramatic turn in last year\u2019s wonderful Can You Ever Forgive Me?, struggles here, relying on her comedic instincts to react unconvincingly to mounting danger, meaning her performance often feels more like an SNL character. It\u2019s a backward step for her but an even worse career move for Haddish, whose comic vibrancy in Girls Trip has been diminishing with each subsequent film. On paper, sidestepping into drama sounded like a smart way to combat audience fatigue but she\u2019s unable to lift herself out of muted, one-note territory, delivering lines without conviction and never exuding the power of a woman who is finally, violently taking control of her life. Of the three it\u2019s Moss, in a rare studio appearance, who comes out of it the least scathed, seeming more comfortable than her co-stars, albeit playing a woman beaten and raped by the men around her, depressingly not far from her most well-known small-screen role.</p> <p>The premise of women fighting against a patriarchal system in a particularly difficult time period in a particularly tough locale feels ever-prescient and even within the confines of comic book territory, there feels like a much smarter and more intricately layered film that could have been made here. But Berloff never manages to get underneath the surface, despite a number of failed attempts to provide social commentary, and as the film limps toward a shambolic, confusing conclusion, any hope that it might improve is replaced with relief that it\u2019s finally about to end. It\u2019s one of the most scattered and incoherent studio films in recent memory, made with such careless abandon that anyone brave enough to buy a ticket should automatically ask for a refund.</p> <ul> <li><p>The Kitchen is released in the US on 9 August and in the UK on 20 September</p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "The Kitchen, a late summer, female-led adaptation of a little-known DC comic, is the worst kind of bad movie. That\u2019s because it has all the ingredients of a good movie, from a juicy premise to a stellar cast, yet it\u2019s assembled with such staggering incompetency that from the very first scene it boils over into one star territory, all promise evaporating from the screen. The boredom and confusion that then follows is backgrounded by an almost angry frustration that someone could get something so potentially thrilling so very, very wrong. That someone would seem to be Andrea Berloff, the Oscar-nominated co-writer of Straight Outta Compton, who here makes her directorial debut while also singlehandedly writing the script. It\u2019s refreshing to see a woman given the reins of a female-fronted DC project, given how it remains such a boys\u2019 club but it\u2019s then disheartening to see what an utter mess she makes of it, both with her risible dialogue and scrappy direction. She throws us into 70s New York with a swirling nighttime shot of the city and It\u2019s a Man\u2019s Man\u2019s Man\u2019s World clunkily explaining the overarching theme of the movie. In Hell\u2019s Kitchen at the time, crime is a man\u2019s business but when their gangster husbands get thrown in jail, it\u2019s up to the wives to step in. Kathy (Melissa McCarthy), Ruby (Tiffany Haddish) and Claire (Elisabeth Moss) aren\u2019t natural criminals but financial circumstances dictate that they need to do something and it doesn\u2019t take long for them to realise they\u2019re a better fit than they might have imagined. There are inevitable echoes of Steve McQueen\u2019s electric thriller Widows, given the set-up, and it\u2019s a comparison which harms The Kitchen in every conceivable way. While McQueen\u2019s film delivered both sharp, impactful action and believably wrought female characters, Berloff\u2019s chucks in three astonishingly underwritten women and coerces them through one confusingly plotted situation to the next. There\u2019s a rhythm that feels off from the start, like hearing a song at the wrong speed or watching a percussion section fail to follow a beat. Scenes either end too soon or go on too long, fights are confusingly choreographed, reaction shots are strangely chosen, editing is baffling \u2013 it\u2019s a swirling pot of bad decisions leading to an end dish that\u2019s both undercooked and overheated. It wreaks of studio interference, a film that feels pulled apart and then haphazardly restitched in an editing suite by a committee of people desperate to get it released before swiftly moving on and all agreeing to never speak of it ever again. Tonally, Berloff can\u2019t decide between broad cartoonish mayhem or gritty Scorsese-lite drama and instead veers maniacally between the two which means her garish excesses and paper-thin characters are often forced into awkward hard-edged solemnity. So much of the film clashes against itself, including, sadly, her cast who can\u2019t quite sell themselves in territory they\u2019re not usually found in. McCarthy, who delivered such an exquisite dramatic turn in last year\u2019s wonderful Can You Ever Forgive Me?, struggles here, relying on her comedic instincts to react unconvincingly to mounting danger, meaning her performance often feels more like an SNL character. It\u2019s a backward step for her but an even worse career move for Haddish, whose comic vibrancy in Girls Trip has been diminishing with each subsequent film. On paper, sidestepping into drama sounded like a smart way to combat audience fatigue but she\u2019s unable to lift herself out of muted, one-note territory, delivering lines without conviction and never exuding the power of a woman who is finally, violently taking control of her life. Of the three it\u2019s Moss, in a rare studio appearance, who comes out of it the least scathed, seeming more comfortable than her co-stars, albeit playing a woman beaten and raped by the men around her, depressingly not far from her most well-known small-screen role. The premise of women fighting against a patriarchal system in a particularly difficult time period in a particularly tough locale feels ever-prescient and even within the confines of comic book territory, there feels like a much smarter and more intricately layered film that could have been made here. But Berloff never manages to get underneath the surface, despite a number of failed attempts to provide social commentary, and as the film limps toward a shambolic, confusing conclusion, any hope that it might improve is replaced with relief that it\u2019s finally about to end. It\u2019s one of the most scattered and incoherent studio films in recent memory, made with such careless abandon that anyone brave enough to buy a ticket should automatically ask for a refund. The Kitchen is released in the US on 9 August and in the UK on 20 September",

Marco Silva\u2019s side have emerged as the only serious suitors for Zaha since Arsenal\u2019s bid for the 26-year-old was rejected this summer. Everton have already seen a \u00a352m bid rejected by Palace at the end of July. Having signed Moise Kean from Juventus, however, Silva is understood to be keen to add more attacking options to his squad and on Tuesday Everton submitted a new offer of \u00a370m plus James McCarthy that would have also involved the Turkey striker Cenk Tosun joining on a season-long loan. That was immediately rejected by Palace, who are reluctant to sell with little more than 24 hours of the Premier League\u2019s transfer window remaining and concerns about how they could replace such a crucial player before the start of the new season. It is understood that Zaha has been left furious by the decision with the player disappointed that the south London club are blocking the transfer despite having agreed last summer to accept any \u201creasonable offers\u201d they received. After his representatives held talks with Palace on Wednesday he submitted the transfer request in an attempt to force their hand before Saturday\u2019s opening game of the season, against Everton at Selhurst Park. It is understood that the chairman, Steve Parish, remains committed to retaining Zaha, although there is a recognition that they cannot keep a player who is unhappy. Everton, who have completed the loan signing of the France international Djibril Sidibe from Monaco, also saw a bid for Arsenal\u2019s Alex Iwobi rejected but are still hopeful of adding extra players to Silva\u2019s squad having agreed to sell McCarthy to Palace.

      "body": "<p>A Bahraini dissident has said he was beaten and threatened with being thrown from the roof of the country\u2019s embassy in London last month by staff trying to halt his rooftop protest against the execution of two men in the Gulf nation.</p> \n<p>Moosa Mohammed said he feared for his life in the struggle atop the five-storey Belgravia building. He said it began when an embassy staffer pushed him, then hit him with a metre-long plank of wood while he was perched precariously on the edge.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe have two people being executed in Bahrain and you will be the third,\u201d the man with the makeshift weapon said, according to Mohammed. His accomplice later declared that nobody would help him because he was on \u201cBahraini land\u201d.</p> \n<p>Speaking publicly for the first time, the protester said that he believed he could have become \u201ca second Jamal Khashoggi, in London,\u201d comparing himself to the Saudi dissident murdered by the country\u2019s agents in its embassy in Istanbul.</p> \n<p>\u201cI believed at the time he was trying to push me off the roof without anyone seeing that he had done this, so that it would look like I had fallen down by accident, or I had jumped off the roof,\u201d Mohammed said, referring to the staffer he says had the weapon.</p> \n<p>The incident is said to have taken place after Mohammed climbed to the top of the five-storey embassy building at 10.30pm on 26 July via scaffolding in an attempt to get more coverage for a protest against the planned executions,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/26/bahrain-urged-to-halt-imminent-execution-of-two-men\"> which had been condemned by Amnesty International and other human rights groups</a>.</p> \n<p>It ended when British police and the fire brigade took the unusual step of forcing entry to the embassy. Mobile phone footage filmed by fellow Bahraini activists shows that police became concerned when they saw Mohammed sitting on the edge of the roof with another person nearby.</p> \n<p>Officers can be clearly heard at street level threatening to \u201cbreak down the door\u201d if the embassy staff visible from the rooftop did not return to their building. Once the police officers entered the building, the incident ended and the human rights protester was arrested for aggravated trespass.</p> \n<p>A statement from the Bahraini embassy on Wednesday praised staff for responding with \u201cprofessionalism and courage\u201d and said an \u201cobjective view of this incident would determine that peaceful and lawful protest does not take place on the roof of a diplomatic premises at 10.30pm\u201d.</p> \n<p>The statement added that the allegation that \u201cembassy staff were trying to kill Mr Mohammed is completely unfounded and ridiculous\u201d and accused him of \u201cunlawfully trespassing\u201d \u2013 and seeking to repeat a previous protest in 2012 when he climbed to the rooftop with a friend to protest against the jailing of a dissident in Bahrain.</p> \n<p>Mohammed, however, said that the two embassy staffers held him down and tried to suffocate him with a wet T-shirt in a second phase of the struggle. \u201cI couldn\u2019t breathe. I felt like I was being suffocated and I was going to die,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>The protester said he managed to wriggle free, and the two embassy staff are then alleged to have tried to tie his hands with a cable. One of the men, Mohammed said, then threatened to \u201ctie him and and throw him like a sheep down the stairs\u201d.</p> \n<p>Footage filmed by activists shows Mohammed clearly limping as he leaves the embassy escorted by police.

      "bodyText": "A Bahraini dissident has said he was beaten and threatened with being thrown from the roof of the country\u2019s embassy in London last month by staff trying to halt his rooftop protest against the execution of two men in the Gulf nation. Moosa Mohammed said he feared for his life in the struggle atop the five-storey Belgravia building. He said it began when an embassy staffer pushed him, then hit him with a metre-long plank of wood while he was perched precariously on the edge. \u201cWe have two people being executed in Bahrain and you will be the third,\u201d the man with the makeshift weapon said, according to Mohammed. His accomplice later declared that nobody would help him because he was on \u201cBahraini land\u201d. Speaking publicly for the first time, the protester said that he believed he could have become \u201ca second Jamal Khashoggi, in London,\u201d comparing himself to the Saudi dissident murdered by the country\u2019s agents in its embassy in Istanbul. \u201cI believed at the time he was trying to push me off the roof without anyone seeing that he had done this, so that it would look like I had fallen down by accident, or I had jumped off the roof,\u201d Mohammed said, referring to the staffer he says had the weapon. The incident is said to have taken place after Mohammed climbed to the top of the five-storey embassy building at 10.30pm on 26 July via scaffolding in an attempt to get more coverage for a protest against the planned executions, which had been condemned by Amnesty International and other human rights groups. It ended when British police and the fire brigade took the unusual step of forcing entry to the embassy. Mobile phone footage filmed by fellow Bahraini activists shows that police became concerned when they saw Mohammed sitting on the edge of the roof with another person nearby. Officers can be clearly heard at street level threatening to \u201cbreak down the door\u201d if the embassy staff visible from the rooftop did not return to their building. Once the police officers entered the building, the incident ended and the human rights protester was arrested for aggravated trespass. A statement from the Bahraini embassy on Wednesday praised staff for responding with \u201cprofessionalism and courage\u201d and said an \u201cobjective view of this incident would determine that peaceful and lawful protest does not take place on the roof of a diplomatic premises at 10.30pm\u201d. The statement added that the allegation that \u201cembassy staff were trying to kill Mr Mohammed is completely unfounded and ridiculous\u201d and accused him of \u201cunlawfully trespassing\u201d \u2013 and seeking to repeat a previous protest in 2012 when he climbed to the rooftop with a friend to protest against the jailing of a dissident in Bahrain. Mohammed, however, said that the two embassy staffers held him down and tried to suffocate him with a wet T-shirt in a second phase of the struggle. \u201cI couldn\u2019t breathe. I felt like I was being suffocated and I was going to die,\u201d he said. The protester said he managed to wriggle free, and the two embassy staff are then alleged to have tried to tie his hands with a cable. One of the men, Mohammed said, then threatened to \u201ctie him and and throw him like a sheep down the stairs\u201d. Footage filmed by activists shows Mohammed clearly limping as he leaves the embassy escorted by police. There were bruise marks on his forearms and left leg, documented in a medical examination made at a London clinic two days later. Mohammed, a longstanding campaigner for human rights in Bahrain, left the country and obtained asylum in the UK in 2006 after he had been repeatedly detained and harassed by the authorities in the authoritarian country. The activist had decided to make the late-evening climb in the aftermath of an earlier, peaceful street-level protest, and had brought up a handwritten banner saying \u201cI am risking my life to save 2 men about to be executed in the next few hours\u201d. He shouted \u201cdown, down with Hamad\u201d, referring to the country\u2019s king. Shortly after he climbed on to the embassy roof, staff arrived and the violent incident began, he said. When activists subsequently examined some of the mobile phone footage taken from the ground frame by frame, they appear to show a white object striking Mohammed. None of this, however, was spotted at the time. Mohammed was released on police bail shortly after the incident. With the help of fellow activists and the law firm Bindmans, he is preparing to make an official complaint to the Met police and ask them to investigate an alleged assault by embassy staff. Despite the protests, Bahrain went ahead with the executions. Mohammed also called on Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, \u201cto expel the Bahrain ambassador; it is irrelevant whether this happened under his direction or this happened under his leadership. Otherwise Britain will be like a jungle, that people could do whatever they want.\u201d Sayed Ahmed Alwadei, the director of advocacy at the Bahrain Institute for Rights &amp; Democracy, who is helping represent Mohammed, said: \u201cThe UK government has spent millions of pounds of taxpayer money providing training to Bahrain\u2019s violent police force. However, the oppression in Bahrain is only getting worse, with more violence and more executions. It is time for the UK government to end its complicity.\u201d",

Had its predecessors not existed, Pauroso\u2019s debut might be the talk of this year\u2019s festival. But the bar for outre carnal clowning was raised high by Palamides\u2019 2018 show Nate, and Pauroso doesn\u2019t quite vault it.</p> <p>She gives it a good go, though: this is a show you won\u2019t easily forget, particularly if you\u2019re selected as her stooge. Gutterplum introduces us to Dale Ravioli, a gawky tomboy showing us what she can do with an exercise ball. A punter is summoned to join in \u2013 and thus begins an hour-long/lifelong relationship leading us from smouldering sex (well, a piggyback), via loneliness and the rekindling of love, all the way to old age and death.</p> <p>I was reminded of a sketch from Pappy\u2019s immortal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/aug/22/pappys-last-show-edinburgh-review\">Last Show Ever</a> that compressed a lifetime\u2019s romance into two antic minutes. Pauroso\u2019s show packs a similar emotional charge, even as, moment to moment \u2013 whether she\u2019s doing sexy pushups, miming a drive to the abortion clinic, or playing air guitar on a pubic wig \u2013 it never stops being ridiculous.

      "bodyText": "Is there a more singular style in comedy than Dr Brown\u2019s? The shows in which he\u2019s had a hand \u2013 his own, culminating in the 2012 Edinburgh comedy award; those of Natalie Palamides; and now Gutterplum by Courtney Pauroso \u2013 are instantly identifiable by their clownish naivety, sexual frankness and a borderline aggressive sense of play. Had its predecessors not existed, Pauroso\u2019s debut might be the talk of this year\u2019s festival. But the bar for outre carnal clowning was raised high by Palamides\u2019 2018 show Nate, and Pauroso doesn\u2019t quite vault it. She gives it a good go, though: this is a show you won\u2019t easily forget, particularly if you\u2019re selected as her stooge. Gutterplum introduces us to Dale Ravioli, a gawky tomboy showing us what she can do with an exercise ball. A punter is summoned to join in \u2013 and thus begins an hour-long/lifelong relationship leading us from smouldering sex (well, a piggyback), via loneliness and the rekindling of love, all the way to old age and death. I was reminded of a sketch from Pappy\u2019s immortal Last Show Ever that compressed a lifetime\u2019s romance into two antic minutes. Pauroso\u2019s show packs a similar emotional charge, even as, moment to moment \u2013 whether she\u2019s doing sexy pushups, miming a drive to the abortion clinic, or playing air guitar on a pubic wig \u2013 it never stops being ridiculous. She effects the transformations from one life stage to the next with vivacity or subtlety as required. I wish she\u2019d had a more willing audience stooge when I attended: his toe-curling reluctance threatened to eclipse the comedy. But there\u2019s no mistaking this as another strikingly in-yer-face show from Dr Brown\u2019s sexy-clown stable. At Underbelly Cowgate, Edinburgh, until 25 August.",

Swansea could do with offloading the high-earners Bast\u00f3n, Jefferson Montero and Andre Ayew but Bast\u00f3n\u2019s early-season form is encouraging. Meanwhile the Bournemouth striker Sam Surridge, who shone in spells at Oldham and Yeovil, has joined on loan. \u2022 Whether it is an under\u2011nine, a first-year scholar or Ben Woodburn, the No 10 on loan from Liverpool, Oxford United have given all 171 of their players a squad number this season. Each number will be printed in the club\u2019s match-day programme. \u201cThose lads wearing the big numbers have something to aspire to: keep making those numbers smaller and smaller until you are wearing a number between 1 and 11,\u201d said the manager, Karl Robinson.",

      "bodyText": "Mining giant BHP is facing renewed pressure to abandon its membership of the Minerals Council of Australia after it was revealed the lobby group is directly involved in an upcoming multimillion-dollar pro-coal advertising blitz. Documents seen by the Guardian show Coal21 \u2013 an organisation created to research low-emissions technology and shares its chief executive with the Minerals Council \u2013 is planning a cross-media advertising campaign to enhance \u201cthe public standing and reputation of Australia\u2019s coal industry\u201d. A source familiar with the advertising pitch said Coal21 planned to spend up to $4.5m on a campaign to \u201cinvoke national pride\u201d in coal. The two-page \u201crequest for proposal\u201d sent to advertising agencies does not mention carbon capture and storage. It follows earlier advertising campaigns (under the historic name ACA Low Emissions Technologies Ltd) that public documents show cost $8m between 2015-16 and 2017-18. The Minerals Council says it is a separate organisation to Coal21. The source familiar with the pitch said the person who contacted agencies about the current advertising contract was a Minerals Council staff member. Shareholder activists and analysts said it showed the two groups were effectively the same organisation. The Coal21 chief executive, Mark McCallum, is also the Minerals Council\u2019s general manager of climate and energy. They said it further highlighted the gulf between BHP and the Minerals Council in the wake of the company\u2019s call for drastic action to address the climate crisis. In what has been described as a landmark speech the BHP chief executive, Andrew Mackenzie, last month declared global heating was indisputable and committed the company to cutting carbon dioxide, including by linking executive pay to emissions reduction. BHP is again reviewing its membership of the Minerals Council following disagreements over climate policy. Some of the tension has been over Coal21, which operates on a voluntary levy paid by coal companies through a deduction on state mining royalties. Dan Gocher, from the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility, said the advertising plans showed Coal21 was a pro-coal front that used a promise to develop carbon capture and storage as a cover. He said BHP\u2019s commitments, including to ensuring that its industry associations advocated in a technology-neutral way, were fundamentally at odds with the Minerals Council and Coal21. \u201cAnything less than suspension of these memberships will show that BHP cannot be trusted on climate,\u201d he said. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Simon Holmes \u00e0 Court, a senior adviser at the University of Melbourne\u2019s climate and energy college, said: \u201cThere may be a separate legal structure, but the Minerals Council is effectively Coal21.

Coal21 was established in 2006 as a fund for research into carbon capture and storage, but the levy was suspended in 2012 having raised only a fraction of that sum. The organisation\u2019s constitution was changed in 2013 to allow it to also promote \u201cthe economic and social benefits of the coal industry\u201d. Documents lodged with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission indicate 20% of Coal21 spending in 2017-18 was on political advertising. BHP\u2019s latest review of its industry group memberships follows an earlier round announced in December 2017 that led to the company leaving the World Coal Association. In his speech, Mackenzie said the company would spend US$400m on developing technologies to reduce emissions from its own operations and the \u201cscope 3\u201d emissions that result downstream from the companies that buy its resources, limit its 2022 pollution at 2017 levels, have net-zero emissions by 2050 and strengthen the link between emissions performance and executive pay from 2021.",

The warped vocals, autotuned within an inch of their lives at certain points, recall Kanye\u2019s divisive <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/nov/23/kanye-west-hip-hop-808s-heartbreak\">808s &amp; Heartbreaks</a> record, while the heartbroken chorus could have slotted nicely on to <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/drake-care-package-2-867643/\">Drake\u2019s new Care Package</a>. As with all of Cub Sport\u2019s music, sex is an integral ingredient here \u2013 in this case, it comes sepia-stained and bathed in the fog of memory, as he thinks about love once made, and a video documenting the same. That he\u2019s thinking about the video rather than watching it hints at a pain so present that any visual reminders are best kept obscured by faulty memory. </p> <p><strong>For more: </strong>Check out Cub Sport\u2019s self-titled album, out now.</p> <h2>Wave Racer featuring Kwame \u2013 Summer Rain</h2> <p><strong>For fans of:</strong> Chance the Rapper, Tyler, the Creator, Cardi B</p> <p>Who\u2019d have thought a Liam Neeson reference would open one of the most thrilling hip-hop tracks of the year? Kwame\u2019s freewheeling flow and infectious joy mirrors that of Chance the Rapper, and his dexterous melodies make good use of a twisting and unpredictable backing track \u2013 the turns in the opening verse are so sharp it takes the brain and body a second to adjust. Summer is fast approaching but you can expect to hear this sunny anthem about rainfall blasting out of cars long before December hits.</p> <p><strong>For more:</strong> Check out Wave Racer\u2019s Flash Drive EP, and catch Kwame at <a href=\"https://www.sandtunesmusicfestival.com/\">SandTunes festival</a> from 30 November to 1 December on the Gold Coast, alongside Logic, Travis Scott and more.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dc5e60f8a439157a92b4b6f532f1ad7d3616a285\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc5e60f8a439157a92b4b6f532f1ad7d3616a285/677_0_5574_4912/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Purcell, aka Wave Racer.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"881\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Purcell, AKA Wave Racer.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jordan Drysdale</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Matt Corby and Tash Sultana \u2013 Talk It Out</h2> <p><strong>For fans of:</strong> Bon Iver, James Blake, Childish Gambino</p> <p>Opposites attract, sure \u2013 but once the initial rush abates, it can be a lot of work to bridge the gulf. Here, Corby and Sultana tout the virtues of compromise, over the type of slinky R&amp;B track you\u2019d usually hear on a Pretty Little Things commercial. Matt Corby has completely abandoned the coastal folk of his past releases in a way that signals his sonic options are now wide open; while Tash Sultana is used sparingly, but effectively, providing distinctive guitars and a high-range vocal. Interestingly, this song was written during sessions for Corby\u2019s 2018 album Rainbow Valley but was wisely held back, used now as a feature piece rather than an aberration. It\u2019s an interesting sonic left turn for both of them, and a great showcase for their talents.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jul/05/sampa-the-great-spod-and-boy-bear-best-australian-music-for-july\">Sampa The Great, Spod, and Boy &amp; Bear: best Australian music for July</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>For more: </strong>Matt Corby\u2019s 2018 album Rainbow Valley is out now; Tash Sultana embarks on a US tour next month.</p> <h2>Dyson Stringer Cloher \u2013 Falling Clouds</h2> <p><strong>Sounds like:</strong> the Velvet Underground, Hole, L7</p> <p>A formative experience at a Falling Joys and Clouds double-header bill from 1991 provides the inspiration for this song, and possibly for the chugging Velvets rhythm track that accompanies the very literal lyrics. \u201cUnderage in Adelaide\u201d sounds like the type of coming-of-age novel that would usually house these kinds of memories, and as the song \u2013 by a trio of acclaimed solo artists, Jen Cloher, Mia Dyson and Liz Stringer \u2013 expands into its final verse, it expertly uses both aforementioned bands as examples of how female contributions are often overlooked or simply erased from history. Falling Clouds also wins big bonus points for the mongrel of a guitar solo that chokes the ending of the song, and the sweetest harmonisation of the word \u201cdick\u201d in musical history.</p> <p><strong>For more:</strong> Listen to Dyson Stringer Cloher\u2019s 2013 Tour EP \u2013 or any of their excellent solo work.</p> <h2>The Rubens featuring Vic Mensa - Falling Asleep at the Wheel</h2> <p><strong>For fans of: </strong>Kids These Days, Ty Dolla Sign, Future</p> <p>It\u2019s hard to divorce the sound of the Rubens\u2019 2015 single Hoops from the earworm hook that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/26/the-rubens-top-triple-js-hottest-100-with-female-acts-absent-from-top-10\">drove it to the top of the Triple J Hottest 100</a> \u2013 but the song\u2019s spiralling, plodding rhythm track actually lends itself quite well to hip-hop. Here the band offer up a similarly sounding bed, adding production flourishes, a processed hook and a guest verse from Vic Mensa to end up with something not a million miles from their usual soul-tinged sound, but fresh-sounding enough to win over a bevvy of new listeners intrigued by the insertion of the Chicago rapper. It\u2019s a bold sidestep that could result in the Rubens making a sizeable splash overseas.</p> <p><strong>For more: </strong>The Rubens are currently touring regional NSW as part of <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/therubensmusic/app/123966167614127/\">their Chucka Buckas initiative</a>, to help provide a boost to grassroots musicians.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ed9c75ffc52102ca62daea26d070701a07f345d3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ed9c75ffc52102ca62daea26d070701a07f345d3/0_20_800_780/500.jpg\" alt=\"Sam Margin of The Rubens with Vic Mensa\" width=\"500\" height=\"487\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sam Margin of the Rubens with Vic Mensa (right).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ali Lander-Shindler</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Clews \u2013 Hollywood</h2> <p><strong>For fans of: </strong>PJ Harvey, the Red Sun Band, Rilo Kiley</p> <p>As an actual place, Hollywood is unremarkable: a dirty commercial strip without any character (aside from the Marvel ones asking for your money). But this is not the Hollywood that appears in countless odes to its dark undercurrents and symbolic success. For Clews, it\u2019s the imagined location of a long-lost lover, being kissed by another at the edge of the world. Sisters Grace and Lily Richardson adopt tight harmonies throughout the track, producer Nick DiDia lends a heft that propels the song along, and depression and feelings of inadequacy run rife throughout. A circle in a circle is how it is sharply described here, with the heartbroken protagonist simply passing time between sleep.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/aug/02/sarah-blasko-holly-throsby-sally-seltmann-seeker-lover-keeper\">Sarah Blasko, Holly Throsby and Sally Seltmann on ageing in the industry \u2013\u00a0and not giving up</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>For more:</strong> Check out Clews\u2019 past singles Museum and Crushed.</p> <h2>Rocket Science \u2013 I Hate Hate</h2> <p><strong>For fans of:</strong> the Stooges, the Saints, the Hoodoo Gurus</p> <p>Overdriven guitars and Kit Warhurst\u2019s sneering \u201cna na na nas\u201d signal that Rocket Science are back, and it\u2019s time to party like it\u2019s the turn of the century again. The theremin doesn\u2019t appear to have lasted the two decades since their thrilling debut album; in its place are strangled strings of guitar feedback, and a pointed attack on the hateful speech that masquerades as open discussion on the internet. The lyrics tackle the hypocrisies of arguing for free speech while silencing others by participating in the outrage culture \u2013 but if you don\u2019t like soapbox speeches with your rock, the message is easy enough to ignore: just enjoy the blasts of guitars and that eternally bratty vocal.</p> <p><strong>For more: </strong>Rocket Science\u2019s album Snake is out 16 August, with <a href=\"https://www.bandsintown.com/en/a/61679-rocket-science\">a national tour starting 30 August</a> in Ballarat.</p> <h2>Coda Conduct \u2013 Leaving Home</h2> <p><strong>For fans of: </strong>MIA, Lady Of Rage</p> <p>The history of popular music is littered with odes to escaping, but rarely has the monotony of a banal workday been captured as succinctly as on Leaving Home\u2019s first verse where each hour is longer than the last and loopholes out of such a life are desperately sought. It turns out the only solution is the simplest one: like in all the classics, just pack your bags and run, no fallback plan, no second thoughts. Vaguely Caribbean vibes anchor this breezy track, and a very welcome and possibly tongue-in-cheek Jebediah nod appears in the chorus with the borrowed lyrics \u201cI smell the morning air\u201d \u2013 suggesting Coda Conduct know exactly <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byYE_f_aFCc\">which song</a> this will sit next to on the alphabetised Triple J database \u2026</p> <p><strong>For more: </strong>Coda Conduct are playing <a href=\"https://www.listenout.com.au/\">Listen Out festival</a> in September, alongside ScHoolboy Q, Flume and Diplo.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c168690adb1fc0ce34d9f8dc097a32d3cbc4720c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c168690adb1fc0ce34d9f8dc097a32d3cbc4720c/0_275_4134_2480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Australian music duo Coda Conduct\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Australian music duo Coda Conduct, whose ode to escape Leaving Home nods at Jebediah\u2019s song of the same name.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cole Bennetts</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Tropical Fuck Storm \u2013 Who\u2019s My Eugene</h2> <p><strong>For fans of: </strong>the Drones, the Triffids, Rowland S Howard</p> <p>To see Tropical Fuck Storm live is to realise that while the Drones\u2019 Gareth Liddiard is the frontman, the band is very much driven by female energy. On Who\u2019s My Eugene, Liddiard\u2019s twangy vocals and abrasive guitar blasts are sidelined by Erica Dunn, whose vocals span from narcotic drawl to fevered yelp over a rhythm track that channels Portishead via Weezer\u2019s El Scorcho. Ominous, obscured references to a drowning and the hypnotic plod of the music hint at something hidden just under the surface: a hushed, evil presence that exists in all the best Australian rock songs. This is the third track lifted from the band\u2019s second album Braindrops, out later this month, and judging by the three blasts we\u2019ve been treated to so far it seems an extremely disparate record is on its way.</p> <p><strong>For more: </strong>Braindrops is out on 23 August. The <a href=\"https://www.tropicalfuckstormrecords.com/\">band tour nationally in October</a>.</p> <h2>Remi ft Whosane \u2013 5AM</h2> <p><strong>For fans of: </strong>Snoop Dogg, De La Soul, the Weeknd</p> <p>An early morning haze brings with it memories of a toxic relationship best left far in the past. The breezy 90s production and conscious hip-hop feel of this track seems nothing more than a red herring; a truly striking final run in which a child is conceived through a night of unprotected sex and a complicated conversation between possible parents ensues. The music drops away, allowing nothing but the harsh cut of the words to linger in the air, forcing the listener to confront the harsh realities of a 5am dalliance. This song will haunt you, and not in a good way.</p> <p><strong>For more: </strong>Remi is touring the east coast of Australia in November.</p>",

The warped vocals, autotuned within an inch of their lives at certain points, recall Kanye\u2019s divisive 808s &amp; Heartbreaks record, while the heartbroken chorus could have slotted nicely on to Drake\u2019s new Care Package. As with all of Cub Sport\u2019s music, sex is an integral ingredient here \u2013 in this case, it comes sepia-stained and bathed in the fog of memory, as he thinks about love once made, and a video documenting the same. That he\u2019s thinking about the video rather than watching it hints at a pain so present that any visual reminders are best kept obscured by faulty memory. For more: Check out Cub Sport\u2019s self-titled album, out now. Wave Racer featuring Kwame \u2013 Summer Rain For fans of: Chance the Rapper, Tyler, the Creator, Cardi B Who\u2019d have thought a Liam Neeson reference would open one of the most thrilling hip-hop tracks of the year? Kwame\u2019s freewheeling flow and infectious joy mirrors that of Chance the Rapper, and his dexterous melodies make good use of a twisting and unpredictable backing track \u2013 the turns in the opening verse are so sharp it takes the brain and body a second to adjust. Summer is fast approaching but you can expect to hear this sunny anthem about rainfall blasting out of cars long before December hits. For more: Check out Wave Racer\u2019s Flash Drive EP, and catch Kwame at SandTunes festival from 30 November to 1 December on the Gold Coast, alongside Logic, Travis Scott and more. Matt Corby and Tash Sultana \u2013 Talk It Out For fans of: Bon Iver, James Blake, Childish Gambino Opposites attract, sure \u2013 but once the initial rush abates, it can be a lot of work to bridge the gulf. Here, Corby and Sultana tout the virtues of compromise, over the type of slinky R&amp;B track you\u2019d usually hear on a Pretty Little Things commercial. Matt Corby has completely abandoned the coastal folk of his past releases in a way that signals his sonic options are now wide open; while Tash Sultana is used sparingly, but effectively, providing distinctive guitars and a high-range vocal. Interestingly, this song was written during sessions for Corby\u2019s 2018 album Rainbow Valley but was wisely held back, used now as a feature piece rather than an aberration. It\u2019s an interesting sonic left turn for both of them, and a great showcase for their talents. For more: Matt Corby\u2019s 2018 album Rainbow Valley is out now; Tash Sultana embarks on a US tour next month. Dyson Stringer Cloher \u2013 Falling Clouds Sounds like: the Velvet Underground, Hole, L7 A formative experience at a Falling Joys and Clouds double-header bill from 1991 provides the inspiration for this song, and possibly for the chugging Velvets rhythm track that accompanies the very literal lyrics. \u201cUnderage in Adelaide\u201d sounds like the type of coming-of-age novel that would usually house these kinds of memories, and as the song \u2013 by a trio of acclaimed solo artists, Jen Cloher, Mia Dyson and Liz Stringer \u2013 expands into its final verse, it expertly uses both aforementioned bands as examples of how female contributions are often overlooked or simply erased from history. Falling Clouds also wins big bonus points for the mongrel of a guitar solo that chokes the ending of the song, and the sweetest harmonisation of the word \u201cdick\u201d in musical history. For more: Listen to Dyson Stringer Cloher\u2019s 2013 Tour EP \u2013 or any of their excellent solo work. The Rubens featuring Vic Mensa - Falling Asleep at the Wheel For fans of: Kids These Days, Ty Dolla Sign, Future It\u2019s hard to divorce the sound of the Rubens\u2019 2015 single Hoops from the earworm hook that drove it to the top of the Triple J Hottest 100 \u2013 but the song\u2019s spiralling, plodding rhythm track actually lends itself quite well to hip-hop. Here the band offer up a similarly sounding bed, adding production flourishes, a processed hook and a guest verse from Vic Mensa to end up with something not a million miles from their usual soul-tinged sound, but fresh-sounding enough to win over a bevvy of new listeners intrigued by the insertion of the Chicago rapper. It\u2019s a bold sidestep that could result in the Rubens making a sizeable splash overseas. For more: The Rubens are currently touring regional NSW as part of their Chucka Buckas initiative, to help provide a boost to grassroots musicians. Clews \u2013 Hollywood For fans of: PJ Harvey, the Red Sun Band, Rilo Kiley As an actual place, Hollywood is unremarkable: a dirty commercial strip without any character (aside from the Marvel ones asking for your money). But this is not the Hollywood that appears in countless odes to its dark undercurrents and symbolic success. For Clews, it\u2019s the imagined location of a long-lost lover, being kissed by another at the edge of the world. Sisters Grace and Lily Richardson adopt tight harmonies throughout the track, producer Nick DiDia lends a heft that propels the song along, and depression and feelings of inadequacy run rife throughout. A circle in a circle is how it is sharply described here, with the heartbroken protagonist simply passing time between sleep. For more: Check out Clews\u2019 past singles Museum and Crushed. Rocket Science \u2013 I Hate Hate For fans of: the Stooges, the Saints, the Hoodoo Gurus Overdriven guitars and Kit Warhurst\u2019s sneering \u201cna na na nas\u201d signal that Rocket Science are back, and it\u2019s time to party like it\u2019s the turn of the century again. The theremin doesn\u2019t appear to have lasted the two decades since their thrilling debut album; in its place are strangled strings of guitar feedback, and a pointed attack on the hateful speech that masquerades as open discussion on the internet. The lyrics tackle the hypocrisies of arguing for free speech while silencing others by participating in the outrage culture \u2013 but if you don\u2019t like soapbox speeches with your rock, the message is easy enough to ignore: just enjoy the blasts of guitars and that eternally bratty vocal. For more: Rocket Science\u2019s album Snake is out 16 August, with a national tour starting 30 August in Ballarat. Coda Conduct \u2013 Leaving Home For fans of: MIA, Lady Of Rage The history of popular music is littered with odes to escaping, but rarely has the monotony of a banal workday been captured as succinctly as on Leaving Home\u2019s first verse where each hour is longer than the last and loopholes out of such a life are desperately sought. It turns out the only solution is the simplest one: like in all the classics, just pack your bags and run, no fallback plan, no second thoughts. Vaguely Caribbean vibes anchor this breezy track, and a very welcome and possibly tongue-in-cheek Jebediah nod appears in the chorus with the borrowed lyrics \u201cI smell the morning air\u201d \u2013 suggesting Coda Conduct know exactly which song this will sit next to on the alphabetised Triple J database \u2026 For more: Coda Conduct are playing Listen Out festival in September, alongside ScHoolboy Q, Flume and Diplo. Tropical Fuck Storm \u2013 Who\u2019s My Eugene For fans of: the Drones, the Triffids, Rowland S Howard To see Tropical Fuck Storm live is to realise that while the Drones\u2019 Gareth Liddiard is the frontman, the band is very much driven by female energy. On Who\u2019s My Eugene, Liddiard\u2019s twangy vocals and abrasive guitar blasts are sidelined by Erica Dunn, whose vocals span from narcotic drawl to fevered yelp over a rhythm track that channels Portishead via Weezer\u2019s El Scorcho. Ominous, obscured references to a drowning and the hypnotic plod of the music hint at something hidden just under the surface: a hushed, evil presence that exists in all the best Australian rock songs. This is the third track lifted from the band\u2019s second album Braindrops, out later this month, and judging by the three blasts we\u2019ve been treated to so far it seems an extremely disparate record is on its way. For more: Braindrops is out on 23 August. The band tour nationally in October. Remi ft Whosane \u2013 5AM For fans of: Snoop Dogg, De La Soul, the Weeknd An early morning haze brings with it memories of a toxic relationship best left far in the past. The breezy 90s production and conscious hip-hop feel of this track seems nothing more than a red herring; a truly striking final run in which a child is conceived through a night of unprotected sex and a complicated conversation between possible parents ensues. The music drops away, allowing nothing but the harsh cut of the words to linger in the air, forcing the listener to confront the harsh realities of a 5am dalliance. This song will haunt you, and not in a good way. For more: Remi is touring the east coast of Australia in November.",

      "bodyText": "More than 90% of land clearing in Great Barrier Reef catchments over a five-year period was attributable to the beef industry, according to new analysis by The Wilderness Society. The environment group has used spatial data analysis to examine which sectors are driving deforestation in the state with the highest levels of land clearing in Australia. The report analysed the more than 1.6m hectares cleared in Queensland between 2013 and 2018 and found that 73% of clearing across the state occurred for beef production. The next largest land uses linked to deforestation and clearing were, in order: sheep, crops, multiple mixed use, mining and extractive industries, and rural housing, according to the study. Beef production was linked to 94% of all clearing in the Great Barrier Reef catchments over the five-year period, the TWS report found. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to argue that deforestation in reef catchments isn\u2019t a problem because everybody knows that the reef is in crisis,\u201d said Jessica Panegyres, TWS\u2019s national nature campaigner. \u201cThese findings help us pinpoint exactly what is driving Australia\u2019s deforestation crisis and beef is number one on that list.\u201d The research was compiled using data the Queensland government makes publicly available on spatial vegetation, land use and clearing across the state. The government\u2019s own analysis already shows that more than 90% of clearing in the state is due to clearing for pasture. But TWS said identifying how individual sectors were contributing could help build understanding of where more action was needed, and which industries were potentially exposed to financial risk as a result of deforestation. \u201cThere\u2019s increasing pressure on major retailers because of global trends toward deforestation-free commitments,\u201d Panegyres said. \u201cSome of those corporations with deforestation-free policies are already purchasers of Australian commodities. \u201cAustralia is well-placed to transition to deforestation-free products, but we need to deal with the beef industry.\u201d Panegyres said it was positive that the beef industry had indicated it wanted to move to a more sustainable footing. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The industry set up the Australian Beef Sustainability Framework in 2017 and it tracks the performance of producers over several areas, one of which is environmental stewardship, which covers land management and vegetation practices, as well as climate change mitigation and waste minimisation. Tess Herbert, the chair of the network, said it was important to differentiate between clearing of remnant vegetation and the active clearing of regrowth that was undertaken in parts of Queensland. \u201cActively managing regrowth and thickening of vegetation can be required for both environmental benefit and production,\u201d she said. She said the framework recognised that deforestation and vegetation management was an issue for its major customers and because of this it had produced a report on the balance of trees and grass cover on beef properties. Herbert said the report looked at both increases and decreases in trees and pastures for the last 30 years across 56 regions and was focused on \u201cevidence-based and practical measures to add certainty and credibility to a contentious topic\u201d. In May last year, the Queensland government introduced new laws aimed at curbing the state\u2019s rate of land clearing. The most recent data summary published through Queensland\u2019s statewide landcover and trees study (Slats) found 40% of clearing that occurred over 2016-17 and 2017-18 was in reef catchments.",

      "bodyText": "More than 120,000 welfare recipients who had their payments suspended last financial year were later found by their job agency to have had a valid reason for not meeting their obligations, according to data obtained by Guardian Australia. The figures suggest the Jobactive provider of about one in five people who were temporarily cut from income support accepted that they had a reasonable excuse for missing an appointment or compulsory activity. It comes amid a debate about the rate of Newstart and after Channel Seven\u2019s Sunrise program sparked outrage last week over a \u201cdole bludger\u201d segment which cited reports saying 78% of people had their payments suspended. The data showed that of the 744,884 participants on the flagship welfare-to-work scheme last financial year, 581,866 had their payments suspended for failing to meet their mutual obligations. The Daily Telegraph story was later cited by the employment minister, Michaelia Cash, as evidence the government\u2019s new compliance regime was working. But departmental figures provided to Guardian Australia shows not all of those who had their payments temporarily cut off were found to be at fault. Only 460,262 people were handed a \u201cdemerit point\u201d by their job agency under the new system, meaning 121,604 people who had their income support suspended were found to have had a reasonable excuse. After changes introduced in July last year, welfare recipients have their payment automatically suspended when their job agency records them as not meeting a \u201cmutual obligation\u201d. The providers do not have discretion and must issue a suspension. Providers would previously contact the job seeker and prepare a report for Centrelink which would impose a suspension or penalty. Under the new system, there has been a 70% increase in the number of suspensions, with job seekers having their payments temporarily cut off 2.3 million times in 2018-19. The Australian Council of Social Service chief executive, Cassandra Goldie, told Guardian Australia the figures \u201cshow that this compliance system is not working\u201d. \u201cWe know that tens of thousands of people have had their payments suspended despite doing their best to meet their obligations,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen your payment is suspended, you may not be able to buy groceries that day or pay the rent. \u201cPeople on Newstart can\u2019t always afford phone credit or access emails but they get their payments suspended if they miss or are late to job agency appointments, even when they haven\u2019t been notified.\u201d The government argues payment suspensions are not a \u201cpenalty\u201d and uses \u201csuspensions\u201d as a \u201clever\u201d to get job seekers to engage with the system. The number of penalties \u2013 where payments are docked or cancelled completely \u2013 have reduced dramatically under the new system. A spokesman for the employment minister said: \u201cAnyone who receives a payment suspension and has a legitimate excuse will be back-paid. \u201cThis is clear evidence that the system is working.\u201d But critics say when people have their income support suspended, their payments are often delayed, adding to their financial distress. They also argue private agencies should not have the power to issue payments suspensions. Historically, the Department of Human Services overturned between 40-50% of financial penalties recommended by job agencies. Jeremy Poxon, a spokesman for the Australian Unemployed Workers Union, said the union had been inundated with stories of \u201cunfair punishments\u201d after the Sunrise segment. \u201cOne of the most common stories we heard was people being cut off while attending job interviews or training, because their providers abjectly refused to reschedule an appointment they were meant to attend that day,\u201d he said. A small group of Jobactive participants are on youth allowance or parenting payments, with most receiving Newstart, which is $277.85-a-week for a single person without children.

      "bodyText": "Scott Morrison will seek agreement from the states to take more action on plastic recycling when premiers meet in Cairns on Friday for the first Coag meeting since the election. In a wide-ranging Council of Australian Governments meeting that will set the agenda for the next term of government, the prime minister will also seek support for the Coalition\u2019s deregulation program across all tiers of government, along with vocational education reforms. The Coalition\u2019s push to put in place bolder national targets for recycling comes amid concern about Australia\u2019s kerbside recycling program and the proliferation of plastic waste in the Pacific region. The issue has risen to national prominence following China\u2019s decision to reject recycling imports and after the stricken recycling operator SKM told 30 Victorian local councils it could no longer collect material from them. Morrison is understood to want to take action on the problem of plastic waste partly to appease concern among Australia\u2019s \u201cPacific family\u201d about the issue, given plastic waste has resulted in a garbage island three times the size of France accumulating in the Pacific ocean. The Prime Minister will attend the 50th Pacific Island Forum leaders meeting in Tuvalu next week. In an interview last week, Morrison decried Australia\u2019s record on plastic recycling as \u201cappalling\u201d, saying states were not upholding their end of the bargain with Australians who wanted to do the right thing. \u201cWe are not recycling plastics in this country, it\u2019s going into landfill or it\u2019s going into boats and being sent up to Asia and ends up washing out of rivers and creating islands of plastic off the coast of the United States, where it drifts to, which is three times the size of France,\u201d he told Channel Seven. \u201cWe have got to get a capable recycling industry that can produce materials out of recycling that can be used elsewhere in the economy. \u201c[Australians] have to be confident that when you put the stuff in the bin it\u2019s not going to end up in landfill or end up on a beach in Indonesia.\u201d The so-called great Pacific garbage patch referred to by Morrison was found in 2018 to span around 1.6m sq km comprised of an estimated 1.8tn pieces of plastic. According to a government report on kerbside recycling released last year, only 12% of the 3m tonnes of plastic waste produced in Australia is recycled. The report also found that only half of the 544 local councils in Australia have a kerbside collection service that accepts all seven types of plastic, and only 10 local government areas accepted all types of plastic and plastic bags. In an interview with Guardian Australia, the newly appointed minister for waste reduction, Trevor Evans, flagged the federal government would push states to adopt procurement targets to create a market for recycled materials. Morrison has said state governments had primary responsibility for recycling, but there was $100m of federal funding on the table to support the recycling push. The Coag meeting will also canvass state support for changes to the vocational education system stemming from a review conducted by former New Zealand minister for tertiary education Steven Joyce. The VET reforms include a co-design of the Skills Organisations and National Careers Institute model aimed at harmonising quality and regulatory issues in the sector. The employment minister, Michaelia Cash, told the Australian on Wednesday that state support for the reforms was needed to ensure the industry had a \u201cnationally consistent and flexible system\u201d.",

Public Health England\u2019s guidance on different actions that could be taken by local authorities and others to tackle obesity includes restricting growth in the number of fast-food outlets through the planning system.

Some parts of the country have long adopted such ideas: in 2010 Barking and Dagenham became the first UK council to tackle the availability of fast food, although by 2017 there was little sign that the efforts were having a positive impact on the waistlines of locals, with 42.2% of 11-years olds overweight or obese.

      "bodyText": "A Jamaican government minister has demanded that the British Museum repatriates objects in its collection taken when the island was a colony. The culture minister, Olivia Grange, wants the museum to return artefacts including a 500-year-old carved wooden figure thought to represent Boiyanel, a rain god; and a carved figure of a bird-man spirit found in a cave in 1792. The demand adds to a growing debate over whether institutions such as the British Museum should hold on to objects culturally significant to their country of origin. Grange made her demands in the Jamaican parliament last week. The Jamaica Gleaner reported her as saying the artefacts were taken during early archeological digs when the island was still a British colony. She said the pieces were made by the Ta\u00edno, the indigenous people of the Caribbean encountered by the 15th-century western explorers. \u201cThey are not even on display,\u201d Grange said. \u201cThey are priceless, they are significant to the story of Jamaica and they belong to the people of Jamaica.\u201d She said ministers were working with the National Commission on Reparations, a group established in 2009, to have them returned. Ta\u00edno objects are in a number of European and north American collections. The British Museum artefacts arrived in the early 20th century from a collection built up by William Ockleford Oldman. A spokesperson for the museum said it had not received any official communication from Jamaica\u2019s culture ministry. \u201cTwo Ta\u00edno objects, a stool and a standing figure have been on public display in the Enlightenment gallery since 2009,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cTa\u00edno objects in the collection have been lent extensively to India, Japan, Spain, France, Singapore and the Horniman Museum in London. The Ta\u00edno ritual seat was part of the A History of the World Tour which has been seen by more than a million people at multiple venues from 2014-18. \u201cThe British Museum has a number of ongoing collaborative research projects with colleagues and island governments in the Caribbean.\u201d The issue of repatriating objects is one of the most pressing debates in the museum world and was given extra impetus by a report commissioned by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, published in late 2018. The report by Felwine Sarr and B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte Savoy recommended full restitution of objects and artworks taken without consent from their countries of origin. As well as Jamaica\u2019s request, Greece wants the British Museum to return the Parthenon Marbles and Ethiopia wants objects taken during the Battle of Maqdala. Talks are ongoing for some of the spectacular Benin Bronzes to be loaned to a new cultural hub in Benin City, Nigeria. The debate arouses strong passions.

For decades, British foreign policy was designed on the principle of the bridge between the US and continental Europe. London had a unique mediating function which was valued in Brussels and in Washington, amplifying UK power in both capitals. Brexit knocked down one supporting pillar of that bridge, and yet Mr Johnson appears not to have noticed or not to care as the edifice crumbles and slides into the sea. It is not too late to adopt a more realistic approach. He might yet engage with EU leaders in a spirit of professionalism and respect. Sadly, those are not qualities often exhibited by Mr Johnson. Diplomacy was once a source of British influence in the world. It should not come as a surprise if the country ends up diminished by its chronically undiplomatic prime minister. \u2022 This article was amended on 8 August 2019 to correctly apply the Guardian\u2019s style guidelines regarding honorifics in editorials.",

Experts noted that the majority of bites are occurring in fast-growing suburbs of cities like Raleigh, Atlanta and Dallas, suggesting that newcomers unaccustomed to living in the south are disturbing snakes living in what was once forest or farmland. \u201cThere\u2019s no question as we build out more, we\u2019re definitely inhabiting the areas where snakes reside,\u201d Gaylord Lopez, managing director of the Georgia Poison Center, told the Journal. For reasons that scientists do not fully understand, rainfall often plays a part in increased snake activity. Last winter\u2019s record-setting rainfall, attributed in part to climate warming, may also be behind the increase in bites. \u2022 This article was amended on 8 August 2019 because copperhead snakes are not rattlesnakes as an earlier version said.",

Native to Central Asia and India, the plant \u2013 known as ganja in Sanskrit \u2013 appears to have been recognised for its psychoactive properties among several pre-Christian cultures, some of which used it in rituals.</p>\n    <p>It was banned in parts of the Islamic world in the 14th century, not to mention in some British colonies, but was not widely proscribed across the world until the US took against it. A series of regulations in the US culminated in the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937 that banned possession or transfer of the drug, except for medicinal use. But it was not outlawed for all types of use until 1970, as the establishment reacted to hippie culture \u2013 a crackdown that continued with President Nixon\u2019s so-called \u201cwar on drugs\u201d, which saw the US place pressure on international governments to follow suit.</p>\n    <p>While countries such as the Netherlands have long defied such pressure, tolerating both medicinal and recreational use, international momentum towards legalisation has only begun to pick up in recent years with relaxation of the law in North America.</p>\n    <p>California kicked off the legalisation of medicinal cannabis in 1996, several states had legalised recreational use by 2012 and a majority of states had legalised medicinal cannabis by 2016. It remains illegal under US federal law. Canada lifted a ban on recreational use in 2018, while the UK legalised medicinal marijuana in the same year, albeit subject to tight restrictions.</p>\n    <p>According to the World Health Organization, there are about 147 million cannabis users worldwide, some 2.5% of the global population.

The officials recommended allowing use of the drug in specific public areas.</p> \n<p>In the Netherlands, possibly the European country most associated with a relaxed attitude toward the use of cannabis, its recreational use, possession and trade is technically illegal. It has a \u2018tolerance policy\u2019, or <em>gedoogbeleid</em>, under which recreational use is largely accepted within bounds.</p> \n<p>Cannabis remains illegal to possess, grow, distribute, sell or grow in the UK. Those caught with the drug face a maximum of five years in prison, an unlimited fine or both. Several police forces have said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jul/22/police-wont-target-pot-smokers-small-scale-growers-commissioners\">they will no longer target recreational users</a> and those with less than an ounce (28 grams) can be given a warning or on-the-spot fine.</p> \n<h2>Legalise it: the status of cannabis around the world</h2> \n<p><strong>Uruguay</strong> legalised the recreational use, production and sale of cannabis in 2013. Only pharmacies are allowed to sell the drug and there are fewer than 20 doing so in a country of 3.5 million people. Customers have to register with the regulator and then are limited to buying 10 grams a week. Four different strains are available.</p> \n<p><strong>Canada</strong> legalised the possession of 30 grams of cannabis, dried or fresh, for those aged 18 or over in 2018. The drug can be bought from a provincially-licensed retailer. In provinces and territories without a regulated retail framework, individuals are able to purchase cannabis online from federally-licensed producers.</p> \n<p>Under the <strong>Netherlands\u2019</strong> <em>gedoogbeleid</em>, prosecutors turn a blind eye to the breaking of certain laws. Technically the possession, use and trade of the drug is illegal, but the authorities allow licensed coffee shops to sell cannabis from their premises, and to keep 500g on site at any time. The police turn a blind eye to those in possession of 5g or less. Because production remains illegal, however, cafes are often forced to do business with criminal gangs to source the drug.</p> \n<p>The <strong>UK</strong> outlawed cannabis in 1928. Possession comes with a maximum of five years in prison, an unlimited fine or both. Those who are successfully prosecuted for producing and supplying the class-B drug face up to 14 years in prison, an unlimited fine or both. Police can issue an on-the-spot fine or a warning for those caught with less than an ounce if it is deemed for personal use, but several forces have said they will not target recreational users.</p>",

Schneider said the legislation was likely to include a ban on non-residents buying cannabis in order to dissuade drug-tourism. Home-growing is also likely to be prohibited. Minors aged between 12 and 17 would not be criminalised for possessing five grams or less of the drug, but those who break the more generous laws will be hit with harsh penalties under the plan. Schneider said he was keen to encourage other EU countries to follow Luxembourg\u2019s path. A government coalition agreement between the Liberals, the Social Democrats and the Greens provides for legalisation within five years. If put into action, Luxembourg would join Canada, Uruguay and eleven US states in flouting a UN convention on the control of narcotic drugs which commits signatories to limit \u201cexclusively for medical and scientific purposes the production, manufacture, export, import distribution, trade, employment and possession of drugs\u201d including cannabis.

Two representatives of the Consumer Choice Centre, a US-based NGO, travelled to Luxembourg in April to offer their advice on legislation. One area of contention is whether to ban the use of cannabis in public, which risks discriminating against tenants and people of limited means. The officials recommended allowing use of the drug in specific public areas. In the Netherlands, possibly the European country most associated with a relaxed attitude toward the use of cannabis, its recreational use, possession and trade is technically illegal. It has a \u2018tolerance policy\u2019, or gedoogbeleid, under which recreational use is largely accepted within bounds. Cannabis remains illegal to possess, grow, distribute, sell or grow in the UK. Those caught with the drug face a maximum of five years in prison, an unlimited fine or both. Several police forces have said they will no longer target recreational users and those with less than an ounce (28 grams) can be given a warning or on-the-spot fine. Legalise it: the status of cannabis around the world Uruguay legalised the recreational use, production and sale of cannabis in 2013. Only pharmacies are allowed to sell the drug and there are fewer than 20 doing so in a country of 3.5 million people. Customers have to register with the regulator and then are limited to buying 10 grams a week. Four different strains are available. Canada legalised the possession of 30 grams of cannabis, dried or fresh, for those aged 18 or over in 2018. The drug can be bought from a provincially-licensed retailer. In provinces and territories without a regulated retail framework, individuals are able to purchase cannabis online from federally-licensed producers. Under the Netherlands\u2019 gedoogbeleid, prosecutors turn a blind eye to the breaking of certain laws. Technically the possession, use and trade of the drug is illegal, but the authorities allow licensed coffee shops to sell cannabis from their premises, and to keep 500g on site at any time. The police turn a blind eye to those in possession of 5g or less. Because production remains illegal, however, cafes are often forced to do business with criminal gangs to source the drug. The UK outlawed cannabis in 1928. Possession comes with a maximum of five years in prison, an unlimited fine or both. Those who are successfully prosecuted for producing and supplying the class-B drug face up to 14 years in prison, an unlimited fine or both. Police can issue an on-the-spot fine or a warning for those caught with less than an ounce if it is deemed for personal use, but several forces have said they will not target recreational users.",

I particularly enjoyed the war cry at the end to \u201cbring it on\u201d should the UK crash out of the EU implying, as it did, that the Tories would be made to pay for their ideologically driven incompetence.</p> <p>It is urgent that something be done to prevent no deal. But Polly\u2019s route, like other similar routes, asks an enormous amount of character and steel from a small number of MPs. Some will feel that voting no confidence equals voting no Brexit which, in turn, equals voting no career. For many this will be an agonising dilemma. Politicians and the public have had to cope with, in some cases, irretrievably damaged relationships, both personal and professional, since the referendum.</p> <p>The tension between this personal dimension and the need to put the country first should not be underestimated. On the whole these are honourable, well-meaning democrats and, individual politics aside, those who wish avert the disaster that is Brexit should consider how best their elected representatives can be supported to do the right thing at this critical time for our children\u2019s future.<br><strong>David Lowndes</strong><br><em>Southampton</em></p> <p>\u2022 Polly Toynbee concludes that a no-deal disaster \u201cwould see the Tories render themselves unelectable for a generation\u201d, but if this is all part of Labour\u2019s long-term objective, it is likely to go horribly wrong. Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s plan appears now to be to win a vote of no confidence in Johnson, and force a general election. His campaign would be based on promising to \u201creopen talks with the EU\u201d, presumably with the forlorn hope of a softer Brexit being arranged, with jobs, investment and trade all hunky-dory! The rightwing media will have a field day.</p> <p>If the election takes place after 31 October, as Dominic Cummings plans, Labour will face the wrath of the electorate for not standing up for remain earlier; consequently the anti-Tory vote will be divided, and Johnson could well stay in power. Has no one in Corbyn\u2019s top team studied Germany\u2019s history between 1930 and 1933?<br><strong>Bernie Evans</strong><br><em>Liverpool</em></p> <p>\u2022 You report that in its efforts to force through a no-deal departure, Downing Street regards the 2016 Brexit referendum as overruling parliament (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/06/michael-gove-accuses-eu-of-refusing-to-negotiate-new-deal\" title=\"\">Gove accuses \u2018wrong and sad\u2019 EU of refusing to negotiate new Brexit deal</a>, 7 August). However, The European Union Referendum Act 2015 says \u201cbecause of the sovereignty of parliament referendums cannot be legally binding in the UK and are therefore advisory\u201d. While the Cameron government said they would implement the referendum result, they were not legally bound by the referendum to do so. Nor was the May government, and neither is the Johnson government. Parliament is still sovereign.<br><strong>Philippa Cowling</strong><br><em>Ilkley, West Yorkshire </em></p> <p>\u2022 Any leader of a short-lived government of national unity to see off a no-deal Brexit needs to be non-partisan.

      "bodyText": "Polly Toynbee\u2019s column (Only a government of national unity can deliver us all from no deal, 6 August) was a joy to read, bringing clarity to the obfuscation surrounding whether or not there can be an election in time to prevent a no-deal Brexit following a vote of no confidence in this arrogant, undemocratic government. I particularly enjoyed the war cry at the end to \u201cbring it on\u201d should the UK crash out of the EU implying, as it did, that the Tories would be made to pay for their ideologically driven incompetence. It is urgent that something be done to prevent no deal. But Polly\u2019s route, like other similar routes, asks an enormous amount of character and steel from a small number of MPs. Some will feel that voting no confidence equals voting no Brexit which, in turn, equals voting no career. For many this will be an agonising dilemma. Politicians and the public have had to cope with, in some cases, irretrievably damaged relationships, both personal and professional, since the referendum. The tension between this personal dimension and the need to put the country first should not be underestimated. On the whole these are honourable, well-meaning democrats and, individual politics aside, those who wish avert the disaster that is Brexit should consider how best their elected representatives can be supported to do the right thing at this critical time for our children\u2019s future. David Lowndes Southampton \u2022 Polly Toynbee concludes that a no-deal disaster \u201cwould see the Tories render themselves unelectable for a generation\u201d, but if this is all part of Labour\u2019s long-term objective, it is likely to go horribly wrong. Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s plan appears now to be to win a vote of no confidence in Johnson, and force a general election. His campaign would be based on promising to \u201creopen talks with the EU\u201d, presumably with the forlorn hope of a softer Brexit being arranged, with jobs, investment and trade all hunky-dory! The rightwing media will have a field day. If the election takes place after 31 October, as Dominic Cummings plans, Labour will face the wrath of the electorate for not standing up for remain earlier; consequently the anti-Tory vote will be divided, and Johnson could well stay in power. Has no one in Corbyn\u2019s top team studied Germany\u2019s history between 1930 and 1933? Bernie Evans Liverpool \u2022 You report that in its efforts to force through a no-deal departure, Downing Street regards the 2016 Brexit referendum as overruling parliament (Gove accuses \u2018wrong and sad\u2019 EU of refusing to negotiate new Brexit deal, 7 August). However, The European Union Referendum Act 2015 says \u201cbecause of the sovereignty of parliament referendums cannot be legally binding in the UK and are therefore advisory\u201d. While the Cameron government said they would implement the referendum result, they were not legally bound by the referendum to do so. Nor was the May government, and neither is the Johnson government. Parliament is still sovereign. Philippa Cowling Ilkley, West Yorkshire \u2022 Any leader of a short-lived government of national unity to see off a no-deal Brexit needs to be non-partisan. Step forward Caroline Lucas? She has integrity and is respected across the house. And she\u2019d have to work in a cross-party way \u2013 no risk of her favouring her fellow party MPs. Jane Mardell Woodbridge, Suffolk \u2022 Thank you, Polly, you have lifted my spirits to think that there is hope out there. Will Jeremy Corbyn read your column?

The literary competitions in poetry and drama, and the visual arts and science exhibitions, are among the best in the \u201cUnited\u201d Kingdom, yet there is never any mention of any of this. Highly talented young people take part in the Eisteddfod, but their abilities are ignored \u2013 and all because it is in Welsh and in Wales. There is no comparison between these high standards and the standards at Glastonbury, for example, and yet it is the latter that is given all of the publicity.

      "body": "<p>Media obsession with powerful advisers is not new. The influence of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/mar/10/uk.mandelson3\" title=\"\">Alastair Campbell and Peter Mandelson</a> was the stuff of hysteria in the Tony Blair years. Bernard Ingham and Marcia Williams were accused of having undue power during the eras of Margaret Thatcher and Harold Wilson. Right back to the original \u00e9minence grise<em> </em>in 17th century France, P\u00e8re Joseph, and probably beyond, the mystique of the all-seeing adviser behind the throne has been a constant theme.</p> \n<p>But how well grounded is this in reality? What we do know is that those who work in the shadows are catnip to journalists who know less than they pretend about the workings of government. This is especially true in an embittered political era with a taste for conspiracy theories that seem to offer partisan observers simple explanations of complicated events. Sometimes the credulity can be abject.</p> \n<p>All of this has suddenly come together in Dominic Cummings, the new Downing Street <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/26/dominic-cummings-a-career-psychopath-in-downing-street\" title=\"\">prince of darkness</a>, whose reputation for malign mastery has quickly vaulted to levels unmatched even by Campbell and Mandelson. Last week Cummings reportedly told his team that parliament could not oust Boris Johnson before the 31 October Brexit deadline even if he lost a vote of no confidence. On Wednesday Sir Malcolm Rifkind warned that Johnson could lose his head if he did a Charles I and defied the constitution in that way.</p> \n<p>When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/07/dominic-cummings-takes-swipe-at-greive-over-confidence-vote-plan\" title=\"\">advisers become the story</a>, as Cummings did this week, they should watch their backs as well as their heads. This sort of thing breeds resentment. Cummings already risks appearing \u2013 and being \u2013 the over-mighty subject of what is anyway a precarious and sectarian government. Something similar ended <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jun/10/nick-timothy-and-fiona-hill-unelected-advisers-who-acted-more-like-dpms\" title=\"\">Nick Timothy and Fiona Hill\u2019s tenure</a> under Theresa May. Over the next few weeks the narrative of Cummings the magician will be tested to destruction. The destruction will either be ours or his, and possibly both.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"c5f88287-e3ac-4fe5-afc1-79088741b790\" data-atom-type=\"profile\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Profile\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Dominic Cummings, the son of an oil rig project manager and a special needs teacher, was born in Durham in 1971. He attended a state primary school followed by the fee-paying Durham school and, in 1994, Oxford University, where he studied ancient and modern history.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>After three years living in Russia, where he attempted to set up an airline connecting Samara in the south with Vienna, the then 28-year-old became campaign director of Business for Sterling, which worked to prevent Britain from joining the euro.</p>\n    <p>Although he has never, as far as anyone knows, been a member of a political party, Cummings was headhunted to be director of strategy for the then Conservative leader, Iain Duncan Smith, in 2002.</p>\n    <p>While he was seen as a \u201cyoung, thrusting moderniser\u201d, Cummings quickly&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/sep/20/marketingandpr.politics\">offended party traditionalists</a>. He quit the job after only eight months, describing Duncan Smith as incompetent.</p>\n    <p>Following the 2010 general election, the then education secretary, Michael Gove, appointed Cummings as his chief of staff. Many in Whitehall found Cummings as difficult as he found them. In 2013, civil servants in the Department for Education&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/dump-fing-everyone-the-inside-story-of-how-michael-gove-s-vicious-attack-dogs-are-terrorising-the-8497626.html\">complained to the Independent</a>&nbsp;of an \u201cus-and-them, aggressive, intimidating culture\u201d created by Cummings and Gove.</p>\n    <p>He never hid his disdain for the workings of Whitehall and has derided Westminster figures in eye-catching&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/ally-of-michael-gove-savages-david-cameron-for-bumbling-cw9tqtgdbjt\">media interviews</a>&nbsp;and published&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dominiccummings.com/\">rambling blogposts</a>&nbsp;that are obsessed over by Westminster insiders. He described prime minister David Cameron as \u201ca sphinx without a riddle\u201d, and former Brexit minister David Davis as \u201cthick as mince, lazy as a toad, and vain as Narcissus\u201d.</p>\n    <p>In 2015, Cummings and the political strategist Matthew Elliott founded Vote Leave, which was designated by the Electoral Commission as the official EU referendum&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/13/vote-leave-official-brexit-campaign-eu-referendum-boris-johnson\">leave campaign</a>&nbsp;in April of the following year.</p>\n    <p>Since the EU referendum, its tactics have been the subject of a series of high-profile scandals. Vote Leave\u2019s use of data analytics has been scrutinised after the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/24/aggregateiq-data-firm-link-raises-leave-group-questions\">Observer reported</a>&nbsp;that the data-mining company Cambridge Analytica had links to the Canadian digital firm AggregateIQ, on which Vote Leave spent 40% of its campaign budget.<br></p>\n    <p>In July 2018, the Electoral Commission announced Vote Leave had been found guilty of breaking electoral law by overspending, following testimony from whistleblowers. The group was&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jul/17/vote-leave-fined-and-reported-to-police-by-electoral-commission-brexit\">fined \u00a361,000</a>&nbsp;and referred to the police. <br></p>\n    <p>Cummings has used his blog to furiously defend himself and the Vote Leave campaign. In March 2019, he was found <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/27/commons-report-rules-dominic-cummings-in-contempt-of-parliament\">in contempt of parliament</a> for refusing to appear at a committee of MPs investigating fake news.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/frances-perraudin\"><b>Frances Perraudin</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Yet it would be as much of a mistake to dismiss Cummings as to exaggerate his mastery. He has certainly brought two weeks of focus to the Johnson government by making the Halloween deadline a non-negotiable centrepiece. He has changed the political conversation from Brexit or people\u2019s vote to deal or no deal. Depending on events in the early autumn, he is clearly gearing up for a possible general election shortly afterwards.</p> \n<p>But Cummings does not control events. He is not Prospero, able to conjure up a tempest that delivers his enemies into his hands. He is having a good run, but he is helped by the most irresponsible parliamentary summer recess of modern times. Even now MPs should be aiming to get back to Westminster and hold the government to account before the planned return on 3 September. They should scrap this year\u2019s party conferences too.</p> \n<p>Cummings is also only one player. The idea that he pulls all the strings is lazy and wrong. The Brexit outcome depends on a tangled web of interests and influences beyond his control. These include everything from the role of the Queen to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/21/uk-biggest-toilet-roll-supplier-wepa-stockpiling-no-deal-brexit-avoid-customs-delays\" title=\"\">hoarding of toilet rolls</a>. In particular, it depends on events in the real economy, in parliament, in the courts, in Northern Ireland, Scotland and the Irish Republic, in the EU and in Johnson\u2019s own head.</p> \n<p>Those who take a Cummings-fixated view of the options find it is easier to forget this. They say the government\u2019s aim is to crash out with no deal on 31 October and nothing will stand in the way. But that is not quite what Johnson and some of his ministers say. They say, still, that a deal is one possibility, perhaps a remote one, and that the UK government is even now looking for a deal with the EU in the next 12 weeks.</p> \n<p>This is often dismissed as a mere smokescreen because the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/30/johnson-varadkar-clash-over-irish-backstop-phone-call-brexit\" title=\"\">deal Johnson wants</a> is not on offer from the EU. But Johnson\u2019s specific demand, though difficult for the EU to concede, is also very particular. He does not want to reopen every bit of the withdrawal agreement. He wants the Irish backstop removed from it. The EU says the backstop \u2013 a sensible guarantee that is supported on both sides of the Irish border \u2013 is a non-negotiable part of the withdrawal agreement. On the face of it, therefore, there is no possibility of a new deal.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ee412637ae7e2dc2dbea43744fb8fb819d5a58d9\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ee412637ae7e2dc2dbea43744fb8fb819d5a58d9/0_364_5468_3280/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dominic Cummings enters 10 Downing Street carrying a Vote Leave bag\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Cummings is also only one player.

Listen to the talk about talks this week. In London, Downing Street says it wants to negotiate. In Brussels, the commission says it is open to \u201cclarification\u201d. In Dublin, the taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, says: \u201cOur position is that the withdrawal agreement, including the backstop, is closed but there is always room for talks and negotiations.\u201d In Belfast, if the Sunday Times is right, the DUP \u2013 yes, the DUP \u2013 says it is prepared to consider a<a href=\"https://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/1161588/brexit-news-ireland-irish-border-backstop-DUP-boris-johnson-leo-varadkar-EU-deal\" title=\"\"> time-limited backstop</a>.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/07/stop-catastrophe-no-deal-brexit-revoke-article-50\">The only way to stop the catastrophe of a no-deal Brexit? Revoke article 50 | Jonathan Lis</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Think too about the economic and political pressures bearing in again on all the protagonists. In Britain the pound is sliding, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/aug/07/no-deal-brexit-call-to-suspend-competition-law-to-avert-food-shortages\" title=\"\">food industry is worrying</a> and, according to the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, business faces an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/aug/01/bank-of-england-warns-1-in-3-chance--brexit-recession-interest-rates\" title=\"\">\u201cinstantaneous</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/aug/01/bank-of-england-warns-1-in-3-chance--brexit-recession-interest-rates\" title=\"\"> shock\u201d</a> and an early 2020 recession. But while Britain will suffer most from no deal \u2013 and heavily Tory and Brexit-supporting regions in England will suffer most of all \u2013 others will also suffer. A detailed <a href=\"https://www.bertelsmann-stiftung.de/fileadmin/files/user_upload/EZ_Estimating_the_Impact_of_Brexit_2019_ENG.pdf\" title=\"\">survey</a> in March by the Bertelsmann Foundation concluded that Ireland in particular will be very hard hit, as will northern France, Belgium and parts of the Netherlands.</p> \n<p>This is not to say that there will therefore be a rephrased deal to avert these and other bad consequences. Varadkar in particular is facing an election and has less room for manoeuvre as a result. Nor is it to say that the UK parliament can be relied on to find a way of stopping no deal or that the Tory party would fall into line in sufficient numbers if a deal were on offer.</p> \n<p>It is nevertheless possible that time-limiting the backstop in some way \u2013 five years is mentioned in some circles \u2013 and agreeing to negotiate the issues in the political declaration in good faith over an agreed timetable might, just might, make a difference. It would mean Britain leaving the EU. Johnson could claim a victory. But it could spare a lot of people, businesses, countries including Britain, and even Johnson himself, some real pain in the process. That deal might just be doable even now \u2013 whatever Cummings may say.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnist</p>",

      "bodyText": "Media obsession with powerful advisers is not new. The influence of Alastair Campbell and Peter Mandelson was the stuff of hysteria in the Tony Blair years. Bernard Ingham and Marcia Williams were accused of having undue power during the eras of Margaret Thatcher and Harold Wilson. Right back to the original \u00e9minence grise in 17th century France, P\u00e8re Joseph, and probably beyond, the mystique of the all-seeing adviser behind the throne has been a constant theme. But how well grounded is this in reality? What we do know is that those who work in the shadows are catnip to journalists who know less than they pretend about the workings of government. This is especially true in an embittered political era with a taste for conspiracy theories that seem to offer partisan observers simple explanations of complicated events. Sometimes the credulity can be abject. All of this has suddenly come together in Dominic Cummings, the new Downing Street prince of darkness, whose reputation for malign mastery has quickly vaulted to levels unmatched even by Campbell and Mandelson. Last week Cummings reportedly told his team that parliament could not oust Boris Johnson before the 31 October Brexit deadline even if he lost a vote of no confidence. On Wednesday Sir Malcolm Rifkind warned that Johnson could lose his head if he did a Charles I and defied the constitution in that way. When advisers become the story, as Cummings did this week, they should watch their backs as well as their heads. This sort of thing breeds resentment. Cummings already risks appearing \u2013 and being \u2013 the over-mighty subject of what is anyway a precarious and sectarian government. Something similar ended Nick Timothy and Fiona Hill\u2019s tenure under Theresa May. Over the next few weeks the narrative of Cummings the magician will be tested to destruction. The destruction will either be ours or his, and possibly both. Yet it would be as much of a mistake to dismiss Cummings as to exaggerate his mastery. He has certainly brought two weeks of focus to the Johnson government by making the Halloween deadline a non-negotiable centrepiece. He has changed the political conversation from Brexit or people\u2019s vote to deal or no deal. Depending on events in the early autumn, he is clearly gearing up for a possible general election shortly afterwards. But Cummings does not control events. He is not Prospero, able to conjure up a tempest that delivers his enemies into his hands. He is having a good run, but he is helped by the most irresponsible parliamentary summer recess of modern times. Even now MPs should be aiming to get back to Westminster and hold the government to account before the planned return on 3 September. They should scrap this year\u2019s party conferences too. Cummings is also only one player. The idea that he pulls all the strings is lazy and wrong. The Brexit outcome depends on a tangled web of interests and influences beyond his control. These include everything from the role of the Queen to the hoarding of toilet rolls. In particular, it depends on events in the real economy, in parliament, in the courts, in Northern Ireland, Scotland and the Irish Republic, in the EU and in Johnson\u2019s own head. Those who take a Cummings-fixated view of the options find it is easier to forget this. They say the government\u2019s aim is to crash out with no deal on 31 October and nothing will stand in the way. But that is not quite what Johnson and some of his ministers say. They say, still, that a deal is one possibility, perhaps a remote one, and that the UK government is even now looking for a deal with the EU in the next 12 weeks. This is often dismissed as a mere smokescreen because the deal Johnson wants is not on offer from the EU. But Johnson\u2019s specific demand, though difficult for the EU to concede, is also very particular. He does not want to reopen every bit of the withdrawal agreement. He wants the Irish backstop removed from it. The EU says the backstop \u2013 a sensible guarantee that is supported on both sides of the Irish border \u2013 is a non-negotiable part of the withdrawal agreement. On the face of it, therefore, there is no possibility of a new deal. Yet step back from this confrontation a moment if you can. Listen to the talk about talks this week. In London, Downing Street says it wants to negotiate. In Brussels, the commission says it is open to \u201cclarification\u201d. In Dublin, the taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, says: \u201cOur position is that the withdrawal agreement, including the backstop, is closed but there is always room for talks and negotiations.\u201d In Belfast, if the Sunday Times is right, the DUP \u2013 yes, the DUP \u2013 says it is prepared to consider a time-limited backstop. Think too about the economic and political pressures bearing in again on all the protagonists. In Britain the pound is sliding, the food industry is worrying and, according to the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, business faces an \u201cinstantaneous shock\u201d and an early 2020 recession. But while Britain will suffer most from no deal \u2013 and heavily Tory and Brexit-supporting regions in England will suffer most of all \u2013 others will also suffer. A detailed survey in March by the Bertelsmann Foundation concluded that Ireland in particular will be very hard hit, as will northern France, Belgium and parts of the Netherlands. This is not to say that there will therefore be a rephrased deal to avert these and other bad consequences. Varadkar in particular is facing an election and has less room for manoeuvre as a result. Nor is it to say that the UK parliament can be relied on to find a way of stopping no deal or that the Tory party would fall into line in sufficient numbers if a deal were on offer. It is nevertheless possible that time-limiting the backstop in some way \u2013 five years is mentioned in some circles \u2013 and agreeing to negotiate the issues in the political declaration in good faith over an agreed timetable might, just might, make a difference. It would mean Britain leaving the EU. Johnson could claim a victory. But it could spare a lot of people, businesses, countries including Britain, and even Johnson himself, some real pain in the process. That deal might just be doable even now \u2013 whatever Cummings may say. \u2022 Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnist",

      "bodyText": "The ever-insightful late Toni Morrison once famously said: \u201cIf there\u2019s a book that you want to read, but it hasn\u2019t been written yet, then you must write it.\u201d The publishing industry\u2019s appendage to that is: \u201cAnd even if it has, write it anyway.\u201d This week, it was announced that Hillary Clinton and her daughter Chelsea will publish The Book of Gutsy Women \u2013 about the women who have inspired them and are \u201cleaders with the courage to stand up to the status quo, ask hard questions, and get the job done\u201d. Over the past few years, a slew of similar books has attempted to fill the yawning gaps left in recorded history regarding women\u2019s contributions. Elena Favilli and Francesca Cavallo\u2019s Good Night Stories for Rebel Girls and its sequel taught girls to aspire to something more than tiaras and coma-kisses. Books aimed at adults such as 100 Nasty Women of History, the Forgotten Women series, Bloody Brilliant Women and A History of the World in 21 Women inspired but also educated, focusing on the many pioneering women who were rubbed out of school textbooks. There are several more titles dedicated to the strides many wondrous, hitherto invisible women have made in specific fields, countries, and time periods. The Little Leaders children\u2019s series, for example, profiles \u201cbold black women\u201d in history. On the surface, it may be tiresome to see another edition added to the canon. But it is interesting that, despite the increasing number of these titles, how little crossover there is in the women selected to be profiled. For every odd repetition of Malala Yousafzai and Frida Kahlo, you would, if you bought a copy of each of these books, still stumble across women you have never heard of, simply because there are so many who have been erased from history. Publishing is, notoriously, a bandwagon industry, jam-packed with doppelgangers and duplicate titles, but the continued popularity and production of books on forgotten heroines signifies a real hunger to hear about the other half of history. The number of pages that continue to be filled demonstrates just how actively women have been sidelined in historical storytelling. In our attempts to document \u201cherstory\u201d through them, it will probably take hundreds of years before we are even close to evening out the balance. You could add another few hundred years on top of that for the time it will take to document the stories of the most sidelined \u2013 all the women who were not white, upwardly mobile, heterosexual and able-bodied. The incessant focus on women who live up to a \u201ckick-ass\u201d or \u201cbad-ass\u201d label may feel like a pain in one to some \u2013 after all, just like men, women want the freedom to be utterly mediocre and then be heralded for it many years after their deaths \u2013 but I\u2019d rather them be \u201cgutsy\u201d than silenced.",

China controls another part in the east.<br></p>\n    <p>India and Pakistan have gone to war a further two times over Kashmir, most recently in 1999. Artillery, mortar and small arms fire are still frequently exchanged.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How did the dispute start?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>After the partition of colonial India in 1947, small, semi-autonomous \u2018princely states\u2019 across the subcontinent were being folded into India or Pakistan. The ruler of Kashmir dithered over which to join until tribal fighters entered from Pakistan intent on taking the region for Islamabad.</p>\n    <p>Kashmir asked Delhi for assistance, signing a treaty of accession in exchange for the intervention of Indian troops, who fought the Pakistanis to the modern-day line of control.</p>\n    <p>In 1948, the UN security council called for a referendum in Kashmir to determine which country the region would join or whether it would become an independent state. The referendum has never been held.</p>\n    <p>In its 1950 constitution, India granted Kashmir a large measure of independence. But since then it has eroded some of that autonomy and repeatedly intervened to rig elections and dismiss and jail democratically elected leaders.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What was Kashmir\u2019s special status?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Kashmir\u2019s special status, given in exchange for joining the Indian union, had been in place since 14 May 1954.

      "bodyText": "Pakistan will expel the Indian high commissioner and suspend trade after suggesting its rival could carry out ethnic cleansing in Kashmir, where tensions remain high following Delhi\u2019s decision to revoke the state\u2019s special status and divide it in two. Amid an unprecedented communications blackout in Kashmir, the Indian government announced on Monday that it would dramatically change its relationship with the state, revoking the special status that the territory was granted in exchange for joining the Indian union after independence in 1947. It also said it would divide the state in two. The move has sparked fierce rhetoric from Pakistan, which also claims Kashmir and has fought two wars with India over the territory, with the country\u2019s army chief vowing to \u201cgo to any extent\u201d to stand by Kashmiris. In a statement on Wednesday, Pakistan said it would cut bilateral trade and raise the issue with the UN. Analysts point out trade between the two countries is relatively small and that it is unlikely the UN will take any action. \u201cThe diplomatic statements on their own mean really nothing,\u201d said Raja Mohan, the director of the Institute of South Asian Studies at the National University of Singapore. \u201cIt\u2019s really what happens on the ground that will be far more consequential. \u201cIt will begin to matter if there is violence in Kashmir and Delhi sees some of it as coming from Pakistan and then you\u2019re back in the Pulwama sort of situation [where dozens of Indian paramilitaries were killed in a suicide car bombing].

But it\u2019s also hard to have a stable family life if your dad is getting gunned down at a Walmart.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/aug/06/stephen-colbert-mass-shootings-gun-culture\">Stephen Colbert: 'America's gun culture is melting down'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Finally, Noah examined the logic of the Fox News host Sean Hannity, who insisted on his show post-El Paso that the safest path forward was an armed guard in every hall of every school and mall.</p> <p>\u201cEvery hall of every mall? That sounds like the bleakest Dr Seuss book ever,\u201d Noah said, riffing: \u201cIn every hall of every mall, on every floor and every door, we need a guard in every room or we\u2019ll end up in the tomb.\u201d</p> <p>Fixing the problem with more guns is not a new idea, Noah said, but what Hannity and others \u201cseem to forget is that guns are everywhere in America\u201d. An armed guard could not stop the carnage at Parkland. The police did everything right in Dayton \u2013 subduing the shooter in less than 30 seconds \u2013 but he still killed nine people.</p> <p>Guns are everywhere, Noah said, \u201cso are you going to put an armed guard in every Walmart? Every movie theater, every synagogue, every mosque, every church, every office building, every bar, every nightclub, every concert, every garlic festival?\u201d</p> <p>The strangest part of this logic for him, Noah concluded, was this: \u201cHannity and Fox News talk every day about protecting American freedoms, but if everyone in America is forced to live in a world of perimeter fences, metal detectors and armed guards in every hall, then it starts to feel like society is living in a prison, and the only thing that\u2019s free is the gun.\u201d</p> <h2>Stephen Colbert</h2> <p>\u201cOne of the disheartening aspects of the aftermath of any one of these tragedies, far too many, is how predictable every stage will be,\u201d Stephen Colbert said to open his second show since the shootings that claimed 31 lives this weekend. \u201cIt makes you feel as though you are living the same tragedy over and over again.\u201d</p> <p>One of those typical stages is the president paying condolences at the site of the tragedy, as Donald Trump was scheduled to do on Wednesday in El Paso. There\u2019s just one problem, Colbert said: El Paso doesn\u2019t want him to visit. The city\u2019s Democratic representative, Veronica Escobar, said on TV that \u201cfrom my perspective, he is not welcome here\u201d.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmjXXszhRuo\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BmjXXszhRuo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>\u201cIt really speaks to your leadership when a town in mourning after an unspeakable tragedy thinks you would bring the mood down,\u201d Colbert said.</p> <p>The situation is doubly awkward, Colbert added, because the president still owes the city of El Paso $470,000 after he hosted a rally there in February. The city claims it has sent Trump multiple invoices, with one from the comptroller reading: \u201cWe realize this may be an oversight on your part.\u201d</p> <p>Colbert had a short answer for that question: \u201cNope.</p> <p>\u201cTrump famously doesn\u2019t pay anybody. He owes $20,000 to the leave a penny, take a penny industry.\u201d</p> <h2>Seth Meyers</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfT3cKP89CQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sfT3cKP89CQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>On Late Night, Seth Meyers focused on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/aug/06/new-york-times-front-page-headline-changed\">the New York Times\u2019s </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/aug/06/new-york-times-front-page-headline-changed\"> headline</a> on Trump\u2019s national address over the shootings. \u201cAfter four years of spewing racist, anti-immigrant vitriol, President Trump read a scripted denunciation off the teleprompter yesterday,\u201d Meyers said, a speech the Times headlined: \u201cTrump urges unity vs. racism\u201d. (Facing criticism, the paper changed the headline for subsequent editions.)</p> <p>In a segment called \u201cHey!\u201d Meyers broke down the headline\u2019s inaccuracy. \u201cYou can\u2019t say someone urged something when they do it completely without urgency,\u201d he said. \u201c[Trump is] already back to quoting Fox News and attacking people on Twitter again today. A better headline would\u2019ve been: \u2018Teleprompter urges unity while old man watches.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The headline was \u201cso weird\u201d, Meyers joked, \u201cit was like when you read a newspaper left behind by a time traveler in a sci-fi movie and realize you\u2019re in an alternate timeline \u2013 Trump urges unity? Cleveland Browns win Super Bowl?</p> <p>\u201cNew York Times, we depend on you,\u201d Meyers concluded. \u201cWe need you to learn the lessons of 2016, and one of them is don\u2019t just uncritically repeat whatever this president reads off a teleprompter, because he never means it.\u201d</p>",

That sounds like the bleakest Dr Seuss book ever,\u201d Noah said, riffing: \u201cIn every hall of every mall, on every floor and every door, we need a guard in every room or we\u2019ll end up in the tomb.\u201d Fixing the problem with more guns is not a new idea, Noah said, but what Hannity and others \u201cseem to forget is that guns are everywhere in America\u201d. An armed guard could not stop the carnage at Parkland. The police did everything right in Dayton \u2013 subduing the shooter in less than 30 seconds \u2013 but he still killed nine people. Guns are everywhere, Noah said, \u201cso are you going to put an armed guard in every Walmart? Every movie theater, every synagogue, every mosque, every church, every office building, every bar, every nightclub, every concert, every garlic festival?\u201d The strangest part of this logic for him, Noah concluded, was this: \u201cHannity and Fox News talk every day about protecting American freedoms, but if everyone in America is forced to live in a world of perimeter fences, metal detectors and armed guards in every hall, then it starts to feel like society is living in a prison, and the only thing that\u2019s free is the gun.\u201d Stephen Colbert \u201cOne of the disheartening aspects of the aftermath of any one of these tragedies, far too many, is how predictable every stage will be,\u201d Stephen Colbert said to open his second show since the shootings that claimed 31 lives this weekend. \u201cIt makes you feel as though you are living the same tragedy over and over again.\u201d One of those typical stages is the president paying condolences at the site of the tragedy, as Donald Trump was scheduled to do on Wednesday in El Paso. There\u2019s just one problem, Colbert said: El Paso doesn\u2019t want him to visit. The city\u2019s Democratic representative, Veronica Escobar, said on TV that \u201cfrom my perspective, he is not welcome here\u201d. \u201cIt really speaks to your leadership when a town in mourning after an unspeakable tragedy thinks you would bring the mood down,\u201d Colbert said. The situation is doubly awkward, Colbert added, because the president still owes the city of El Paso $470,000 after he hosted a rally there in February. The city claims it has sent Trump multiple invoices, with one from the comptroller reading: \u201cWe realize this may be an oversight on your part.\u201d Colbert had a short answer for that question: \u201cNope. \u201cTrump famously doesn\u2019t pay anybody. He owes $20,000 to the leave a penny, take a penny industry.\u201d Seth Meyers On Late Night, Seth Meyers focused on the New York Times\u2019s headline on Trump\u2019s national address over the shootings. \u201cAfter four years of spewing racist, anti-immigrant vitriol, President Trump read a scripted denunciation off the teleprompter yesterday,\u201d Meyers said, a speech the Times headlined: \u201cTrump urges unity vs. racism\u201d. (Facing criticism, the paper changed the headline for subsequent editions.) In a segment called \u201cHey!\u201d Meyers broke down the headline\u2019s inaccuracy. \u201cYou can\u2019t say someone urged something when they do it completely without urgency,\u201d he said. \u201c[Trump is] already back to quoting Fox News and attacking people on Twitter again today. A better headline would\u2019ve been: \u2018Teleprompter urges unity while old man watches.\u2019\u201d The headline was \u201cso weird\u201d, Meyers joked, \u201cit was like when you read a newspaper left behind by a time traveler in a sci-fi movie and realize you\u2019re in an alternate timeline \u2013 Trump urges unity? Cleveland Browns win Super Bowl? \u201cNew York Times, we depend on you,\u201d Meyers concluded. \u201cWe need you to learn the lessons of 2016, and one of them is don\u2019t just uncritically repeat whatever this president reads off a teleprompter, because he never means it.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Diageo has bought the \u201cgame-changing\u201d non-alcoholic spirit Seedlip, adding it to a drinks cupboard that includes Guinness and Johnnie Walker whisky. The drinks company bought 20% of Seedlip in 2016 through its Distill Ventures division, which invests in small businesses it believes have the potential to make a splash in the industry. It has now increased its share to take a majority stake, in a deal whose value was not disclosed, but its existing assets and rapid growth indicate that its founder, Ben Branson, will have made millions by a sizeable chunk of the 80% stake he owned. So far, Distill Ventures has invested more than \u00a360m in about 15 drinks brands. Four years after Branson began making the distilled but non-alcoholic drink in his kitchen, Seedlip is served in more than 7,500 outlets in 25 countries, including more than 300 Michelin-starred restaurants. \u201cWe want to change the way the world drinks and today\u2019s news is another big step forward to achieving this,\u201d said Branson, who produces three versions of the spice-based drink. John Kennedy, Diageo\u2019s president of Europe, Turkey and India, said the brand was \u201cgame-changing\u201d and was likely to be a global drinks giant of the future. Drinks companies have been responding to changing tastes, particularly among younger people, a growing number of whom do not drink or do so only in small quantities. Teetotalism in Britain increased to 22% in 2017 from 19% in 2005 for those aged between 16 and 24, according to a 2018 report from the Office for National Statistics. As sales of alcoholic drinks have slowed, many manufacturers have been introducing lower-strength beers or even wines, while others have produced drinks designed to mimic the role played by spirits in cocktails.",

Little wonder that Kay has come to think of herself as a creature not only of genetics but of the imagination. As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/20/jackie-kay-scotland-poet-new-makar\">Scotland\u2019s national poet</a> writes in her beautiful memoir <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jun/26/red-dust-road-jackie-kay\">Red Dust Road</a>, she is \u201cpart fable, part porridge\u201d.</p> <p>Red Dust Road, adapted for the stage by Tanika Gupta, is to be presented at the Edinburgh international festival.

He read the first 20 pages of the Red Dust Road script and handed it back with the words: \u201cJackie, I cannae read any mair. I\u2019m saturated in my ain life.\u201d His daughter feels the same. Yet she has returned again and again to her own story. Her first poetry collection, The Adoption Papers, written in the 1980s before she had made contact with either lost parent, imagined her biological mother\u2019s voice. \u201cI gave birth to my birth mother,\u201d says Kay with a laugh. \u201cHow creepy is that?\u201d</p> <p>Red Dust Road, more than 20 years on, told the story of her search for her parents. Her most recent book, Bantam, contains two poems about her birth mother, who died in 2016 and whose name was Margaret \u2013 but in Red Dust Road, she is referred to as Elizabeth. Kay attended the funeral and read two poems: one during the service, another at the graveside. It was a difficult experience. She was introduced as the national poet of Scotland, she says, but not as Margaret\u2019s daughter. \u201cI found that very hurtful, but I will get over it. There\u2019s no point in holding on to rancour and bitterness.\u201d</p> <p>Although she built a relationship of sorts with her birth mother after meeting her for the first time in 1991, she only ever had that one meeting \u2013 in 2003, in an Abuja hotel \u2013 with her biological father. The scene, as she recreates it, is tragicomic: Jonathan is a born-again Christian who preaches and dances and sings at her, stopping only to ask her inappropriate questions about her lesbian relationship: \u201cSo how do you have sex?\u201d Kay had hoped that they would meet again, but he refused. They are not in contact, although she is in touch with his sons, one of whom is coming to see Red Dust Road.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Scotland is 30 or 40 years behind any other English city in terms of racial attitudes and integration</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I tell Kay the memoir made me feel angry, on her behalf, towards her birth father. This, she says, is a common reaction. She is not angry: to allow herself that emotion would be an acknowledgement of weakness. All Kay\u2019s birth father ever gave her, beyond the moment of conception, was that one unsatisfactory encounter in Nigeria. But through storytelling, that moment of pain has become a crucial and brilliant scene. It feels like a rebalancing of power.</p> <p>\u201cI think that\u2019s right,\u201d she says. \u201cI didn\u2019t think of it as revenge. In a deeper way I am taking something from him.

But I think I have a right to tell my own story.\u201d</p> <p>Since 2016, Kay has been Scotland\u2019s <em>makar</em>, a position akin to poet laureate. \u201cIt\u2019s a fantastic gift,\u201d she says. \u201cIt gives me a chance to record our history at this hugely important time politically.\u201d Her tenure will end in 2021. The appointment is made by the Scottish government and Kay intends to argue that her successor should be paid \u00a330,000 annually, in line with that of Ireland\u2019s professor of poetry. \u201cI think it\u2019s really scandalous to pay your national poet five grand.\u201d This isn\u2019t a personal complaint about what she earns, she wants to make clear. She feels honoured to have the role.

      "bodyText": "A neighbourly dispute in the laid-back Californian comminuty of Manhattan Beach has deteriorated into pulling faces. Giant, grotesque faces, on the side of a hot-pink house. As first reported by Mark McDermott for Easy Reader News, homeowner Kathryn Kidd says her intent in covering the walls of her two-level duplex with two gurning yellow emojis was to bring her neighbours joy, and definitely not to get back at them for reporting her for illegally renting it out on Airbnb. Kidd said: \u201cInstead of everybody being so gloomy, always so depressed, always in other people\u2019s business, I just wanted to send a message to be happy.\u201d Her neighbour, Susan Wieland, strongly believes the opposite. She was among those to report Kidd to the city over the illegal short-term rental earlier this year, resulting in a fine of $4,000, and her house looks out at Kidd\u2019s from a few streets away. Both emojis have exaggerated eyelashes \u2013 Wieland had got eyelash extensions just before they were painted \u2013 and seem to look directly at her home, while one has a zipped mouth: as McDermott soberly notes, \u201ccommon parlance, in emoji communication, for \u2018shut up\u2019.\u201d Wieland has not opened her curtains since seeing the emojis for the first time. Kidd\u2019s definitely non-targeted or taunting paintjob has been hailed as \u201cremarkably spiteful\u201d and \u201ca weird flex of garish artwork\u201d \u2013 but it is not the first row over emojis and their ambiguous meanings. Politicians versus parliamentary rules On Boris Johnson\u2019s first day as prime minister, the Conservative MP James Cleverly got around rules forbidding photographs within the chamber by tweeting \u201can artist\u2019s impression of the Labour benches\u201d facing him: a screed of sad, shocked and two angry faces. Labour\u2019s Angela Rayner responded by picturing the Tory front bench with a row of clowns. And Jack Mendel of the Jewish News contributed a man and a woman face-palming: \u201cAnd here is the country watching two grownup politicians battling it out through emojis on Twitter\u201d. Geoffrey Rush\u2019s winking tongue-out text message As emojis become established as digital communication, they are increasingly making appearances in court, mostly in sexual harassment and criminal cases. Although the Santa Clara University law professor Eric Goldman, who has been tracking them in the US, told Wired that they are rarely a factor in deciding a case, questions of their interpretation could be an ongoing issue for courts to contend with. Employment lawyers, too, have suggested that employers review their guidance for rules governing emojis in office communications given the potential for misunderstanding and HR disputes. In Geoffrey Rush\u2019s defamation trial against Australia\u2019s Daily Telegraph (in which he was later awarded AU $2.9m in damages), it was revealed that he had sent a woman acting alongside him in King Lear a winking emoji with its tongue hanging out, with the message that he had been thinking of her \u201cmore than is socially appropriate\u201d. Under cross-examination, Rush said it was a throwaway joke \u201cin the style of Groucho Marx\u201d, and denied that the emoji was flirtatious or \u201cpanting\u201d \u2013 it was simply \u201cthe looniest\u201d he could find. To quote Perth Now: \u201cHe said he would have used a Groucho Marx emoji, but the range of emojis was limited. However, he \u2018was able to send the entire story of King Lear in 45 emojis\u2019.\u201d Associated Press struggles with quotes Last year, Associated Press updated its stylebook to include guidance for quoting emojis in news reports, advising reporters to \u201ctreat the visual material as context or gestures when important to include\u201d. It gave the example of \u201cdescribing by paraphrasing\u201d as an airline tweeting \u201can emoji string of a worried smiley, a ring, an hourglass and an umbrella propped on a beach\u201d. Reporters should not describe an emoji in brackets within a quote, \u201cto avoid confusing readers\u201d. Tiny food pictures not not good enough to eat It seems that people care very deeply about accuracy in emoji representations of food. Apple\u2019s paella emoji was updated in early 2017 to replace shrimp and peas with chicken, lima beans and green beans to reflect the traditional dish from Valencia. Later that year it was pointed out that Google\u2019s burger emoji placed the cheese underneath the burger patty, instead of on top of it \u2013 and Google CEO Sundar Pichai said he would \u201cdrop everything\u201d to fix it. Last year Apple\u2019s bagel design was made doughier in texture and given a cream cheese filling following criticism that it did not look like it would be delicious to eat. A notable exception was when Apple proposed making the peach emoji look more like a peach and less like a bum, which prompted outcry \u2013 revealing that the symbol was far more widely used for its sexual connotations than it was to communicate stone fruit. Kim Kardashian blocks Swifties\u2019 snakes When Taylor Swift released Look What You Made Me Do in 2017, it was widely perceived to be a spite-filled shot at Kim Kardashian for their convoluted run-in the previous year. Swift\u2019s many fans gleefully swamped Kardashian\u2019s social media accounts with snake emoji, but Instagram allowed her to block them in a test of a new feature allowing users to \u201chide inappropriate comments\u201d. Emoji no soft landing Last year, Dallas-Fort Worth international airport complained that the emoji for an incoming airplane looked like it was crashing, to the widespread agreement from other airports\u2019 Twitter presences. Memphis international airport fretted the existing emoji was a \u201ca little too crash-y\u201d. One hopes that the pilots are going by larger-scale instructions.",

The stone wall, in Llanrhystud, near Aberystwyth, was first painted in the 1960s with the slogan \u201cCofiwch Dryweryn\u201d (\u201cRemember Tryweryn\u201d), a reference to the UK parliament\u2019s decision to allow the flooding of the Tryweryn valley in north Wales in 1965 to create a reservoir serving the city of Liverpool.

Some local officials had even urged Trump to stay away.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/07/el-paso-shooting-hispanic-latino-culture-america\">'This guy doesn\u2019t get to change our DNA in one day': defiant El Paso chooses love over hate</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Trump nonetheless barreled forward with plans to visit both Dayton and El Paso. He also launched a Twitter attack on the Democratic frontrunner Joe Biden, who criticized him in a speech. Trump lashed out at Biden, saying a speech where the former vice-president slammed Trump for fanning \u201cthe flames of white supremacy\u201d, was \u201csooo boring\u201d.</p> \n<p>Earlier on Wednesday, Trump dismissed claims that his words and actions were contributing to violence.</p> \n<p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think my rhetoric has at all. I think my rhetoric brings people together,\u201d Trump said, while dismissing the criticism as an attempt by his opponents to score \u201cpolitical points\u201d.</p> \n<p>Pressed on the impact of his incendiary language on immigration, Trump sought to deflect focus to social media posts allegedly shared by the suspect in Dayton in support of Democrats.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn Dayton, it just came out, he was a fan of \u2018antifa\u2019, he was a fan of Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren \u2013 nothing to do with Trump, but nobody ever mentions that,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Authorities are still searching for any specific motive in Dayton, but they have ruled out a hate crime against any group of people and said there is \u201cno indication\u201d the gunman\u2019s political views bore any relation to the mass murder.</p> \n<p>The El Paso shooting, meanwhile, is being investigated as a case of domestic terrorism after officials discovered a manifesto \u2013 believed to be written by the suspect \u2013 describing the attack as a response to \u201cthe Hispanic invasion of Texas\u201d. Trump, who has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/05/trump-analysis-republican-party-mass-shootings\">not directly addressed</a> the El Paso suspect\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/03/el-paso-shooting-21-year-old-suspect-in-custody-as-officials-investigate-possible-hate\">manifesto</a>, has stoked fears around an \u201cinvasion\u201d, using that exact word repeatedly, of migrants at the southern border.</p> \n<p>Trump did not have any public events scheduled during his travel to the grief-stricken cities. White House aides said he would meet privately with victims and their families, as well as first responders and hospital staff.</p> \n<p>Before Trump\u2019s arrival, protesters assembled in downtown Dayton brandishing signs that read \u201cDump Trump\u201d and \u201cProtect kids \u2013 not guns\u201d. Several shops and restaurants along the busy street where the gunman opened fire, killing nine in just 32 seconds at a packed bar in the early hours of Sunday, greeted Trump with messages pushing for action. \u201cOur grief is not a commodity. Do something,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hillarylake/status/1159123515771150336\">read</a> one banner.</p> \n<p>In an address to the American public via TV from the White House on Monday, Trump did not call for any new gun laws.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump arrived on Air Force One in El Paso, Texas, to be greeted by protesters three days after two mass shootings rocked the US and sparked a firestorm over the president\u2019s role in inflaming racist sentiments. Trump\u2019s visit to sites of back-to-back massacres, which left at least 31 dead and more than 50 injured at the weekend in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, ignited controversy amid allegations that his anti-immigrant rhetoric potentially influenced the gunman in El Paso who opened fire on a predominantly Hispanic community. Some local officials had even urged Trump to stay away. Trump nonetheless barreled forward with plans to visit both Dayton and El Paso. He also launched a Twitter attack on the Democratic frontrunner Joe Biden, who criticized him in a speech. Trump lashed out at Biden, saying a speech where the former vice-president slammed Trump for fanning \u201cthe flames of white supremacy\u201d, was \u201csooo boring\u201d. Earlier on Wednesday, Trump dismissed claims that his words and actions were contributing to violence. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think my rhetoric has at all. I think my rhetoric brings people together,\u201d Trump said, while dismissing the criticism as an attempt by his opponents to score \u201cpolitical points\u201d. Pressed on the impact of his incendiary language on immigration, Trump sought to deflect focus to social media posts allegedly shared by the suspect in Dayton in support of Democrats. \u201cIn Dayton, it just came out, he was a fan of \u2018antifa\u2019, he was a fan of Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren \u2013 nothing to do with Trump, but nobody ever mentions that,\u201d he said. Authorities are still searching for any specific motive in Dayton, but they have ruled out a hate crime against any group of people and said there is \u201cno indication\u201d the gunman\u2019s political views bore any relation to the mass murder. The El Paso shooting, meanwhile, is being investigated as a case of domestic terrorism after officials discovered a manifesto \u2013 believed to be written by the suspect \u2013 describing the attack as a response to \u201cthe Hispanic invasion of Texas\u201d. Trump, who has not directly addressed the El Paso suspect\u2019s manifesto, has stoked fears around an \u201cinvasion\u201d, using that exact word repeatedly, of migrants at the southern border. Trump did not have any public events scheduled during his travel to the grief-stricken cities. White House aides said he would meet privately with victims and their families, as well as first responders and hospital staff. Before Trump\u2019s arrival, protesters assembled in downtown Dayton brandishing signs that read \u201cDump Trump\u201d and \u201cProtect kids \u2013 not guns\u201d. Several shops and restaurants along the busy street where the gunman opened fire, killing nine in just 32 seconds at a packed bar in the early hours of Sunday, greeted Trump with messages pushing for action. \u201cOur grief is not a commodity. Do something,\u201d read one banner. In an address to the American public via TV from the White House on Monday, Trump did not call for any new gun laws. He instead laid the blame for the massacres on violent video games and movies, online radicalization and mental illness. Opponents have pointed out that other countries have similar rates of all those factors, but only the US with its lax gun laws has mass shootings with astonishing frequency. Trump told reporters on Wednesday he was \u201clooking to do background checks\u201d on firearm purchases, although he did not specify if he wished to expand them. Democrats in Congress and a handful of Republicans have called for universal background checks \u2013 a proposal backed by an overwhelmingly majority of the American public. \u201cI think background checks are important. I don\u2019t want to put guns into the hands of mentally unstable people or people with rage or a sick people,\u201d Trump said. Asked if he would back a ban on military-style assault weapons, Trump said there was \u201cno political appetite for that at this moment\u201d. In a direct counter to Trump\u2019s visit to the border city, the Democratic presidential candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke addressed an #ElPasoStrong event at a park on Wednesday afternoon. O\u2019Rourke, an El Paso native and former congressman, had discouraged Trump from visiting, flatly stating that Trump \u201chas no place here\u201d. \u201cHe\u2019s helped to create what we saw in El Paso on Saturday,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said. \u201cHe\u2019s helped to produce the suffering that we are experiencing right now. This community needs to heal.\u201d The congresswoman Veronica Escobar, who succeeded O\u2019Rourke in representing the El Paso area in Congress, also said Trump was not welcome in El Paso. The city\u2019s Republican mayor, Dee Margo, said he would welcome Trump in an official capacity but warned the president against making further inflammatory statements about the city. Democratic 2020 contenders meanwhile amplified their warnings about the rise of white nationalism. The former vice-president Joe Biden drew a direct link between Trump\u2019s anti-immigrant rhetoric and the alleged views of the El Paso shooter during a Wednesday rally in Iowa. \u201cIn both clear language and in code, this president has fanned the flames of white supremacy in this nation,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWe have a president who has aligned himself with the darkest forces in this nation. And that makes winning the battle for the soul of this nation that much harder.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The UK\u2019s train operators are to pull out of the Interrail scheme, which has allowed unlimited train travel across Europe for a fixed price for almost 50 years. The Rail Delivery Group (RDG), which represents the industry, said it would withdraw on 1 January 2020. It will also pull out of Eurail, the parallel scheme for non-EU visitors. The change will have little effect on UK travellers to Europe, who will still be able to travel across EU countries, but they will no longer have the option of starting their trip from their home station. Instead they will have to begin their journey on the Eurostar from London St Pancras. European travellers will not, however, be able to visit the UK as part of their Interrail adventures. Instead they will have the option of buying BritRail passes offering unlimited train travel across England, Scotland and Wales, but for roughly the same price as the current Interrail passes that cover the whole continent, including the UK. A one-month BritRail pass costs \u20ac605 (\u00a3557) for adults and \u20ac363 for those 25 and under. A one-month Interrail pass costs \u20ac603 for adults and \u20ac464 for those aged 12 to 27. The former Labour transport secretary Andrew Adonis said the decision to pull out of the Interrail scheme was shocking. He tweeted: Luisa Porritt, the deputy leader of Liberal Democrat MEPs, said: \u201cThis is a desperately sad decision, which in particular could lead to fewer young Europeans enjoying Britain and more barriers to Brits enjoying the rest of Europe. This sends the message we are turning our backs on Europe and the fantastic opportunities it offers us. What a terrible advertisement for UK plc. \u201cTravel across Europe is already set to become more difficult, cumbersome and expensive as a result of this Tory government\u2019s disastrous Brexit policy.\u201d Robert Nisbet, the RDG\u2019s director of nations and regions, said British operators had pulled out because offering the Interrail schemes alongside BritRail was \u201cconfusing\u201d. \u201cThe rail industry boosts British tourism and, working together, rail companies are offering the best option for tourists with BritRail, which is recommended by Visit Britain, offers two-for-one deals on 200 attractions across the country and includes the convenience of mobile tickets,\u201d Nisbet said. \u201cAlthough the Eurail Group has ended our decades-long membership of Interrail since we stopped trialling Eurail passes, British people will feel no difference. They can still buy an Interail pass, get the Eurostar and travel by train across Europe.\u201d Eurail\u2019s general manager, Carlo Boselli said in a tweeted statement: \u201cI deeply regret that RDG\u2019s priority to secure a competitive position for their BritRail Pass has led them to pull out of Interrail and Eurail.\u201d Manuel Cortes, the general secretary of the Transport Salaried Staffs\u2019 Association (TSSA), said: \u201cThe RDG blames this on a dispute with the Eurail Group, but that\u2019s nonsense. This has got small-mindedness written all over it, along with the government\u2019s Brexit fingerprints. \u201cEither this shows the true Little Englander nature of the Tories, or how out of touch the rail companies are with the people. Or both. Either way it\u2019s not good enough. \u201cThis is a truly retrograde step limiting the ability of young people to explore the continent they live in and do so in an affordable and environmentally friendly way. Be in no doubt this decision will harm tourism outside of London and the wider economy. I\u2019d urge the RDG and transport secretary, Grant Shapps, to think again and quickly sort this out.\u201d The Interrail scheme was launched in 1972, offering people up to the age of 21 the possibility of travelling to 21 countries for \u00a327.50. More than 300,000 Interrail passes were sold last year, almost three times the figure for 2005. Mark Smith, a train travel expert and founder of the website The Man in Seat 61, tweeted:",

      "bodyText": "Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon \u201cexploded\u201d in July it has emerged as Jair Bolsonaro scoffed at his portrayal as Brazil\u2019s \u201cCaptain Chainsaw\u201d and mocked Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel for challenging him over the devastation. Speaking in S\u00e3o Paulo on Tuesday, Brazil\u2019s president attacked the leaders of France and Germany \u2013 who have both voiced concern about the surge in destruction since Bolsonaro took office in January. \u201cThey still haven\u2019t realized Brazil\u2019s under new management,\u201d Bolsonaro declared to cheers of approval from his audience. \u201cNow we\u2019ve got a blooming president.\u201d The far-right populist repeated claims that his administration \u2013 which critics accuse of helping unleash a new wave of environmental destruction \u2013 was the victim of a mendacious international smear campaign based on \u201cimprecise\u201d satellite data showing a jump in deforestation. Bolsonaro ridiculed what he called his depiction as \u201cCapit\u00e3o Motoserra\u201d (\u201cCaptain Chainsaw\u201d). But as he spoke, official data laid bare the scale of the environmental crisis currently unfolding in the world\u2019s biggest rainforest, of which about 60% is in Brazil. According to a report in the Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo newspaper, Amazon destruction \u201cexploded\u201d in July with an estimated 2,254 sq km (870 sq miles) of forest cleared, according to preliminary data gathered by Brazil\u2019s National Institute for Space Research, the government agency that monitors deforestation. That is an area about half the size of Philadelphia and reportedly represents a 278% rise on the 596.6 sq km destroyed in July last year. R\u00f4mulo Batista, an Greenpeace campaigner based in the Amazon city of Manaus, said the numbers \u2013 while preliminary \u2013 were troubling and showed a clear trend of rising deforestation under Bolsonaro. What was not yet clear was if the devastation was \u201cgoing up, going up a lot, or skyrocketing\u201d. Batista blamed Bolsonaro\u2019s \u201canti-environmental\u201d discourse and policies \u2013 such as slashing the budget of Brazil\u2019s environmental agency, Ibama \u2013 for the surge. \u201cIt\u2019s almost as if a licence to deforest illegally and with impunity has been given, now that you have the [environmental] inspection and control teams being attacked by no less than the president of the republic and the environment minister,\u201d Batista added. \u201cThis is a very worrying moment.\u201d The spike in destruction under Bolsonaro \u2013 who was elected with the support of powerful mining and agricultural sectors \u2013 has come as a shock to environmentalists, but not a surprise. During a visit to the Amazon last year Bolsonaro told the Guardian that as president he would target \u201ccowardly\u201d environmental NGOs who were \u201csticking their noses\u201d into Brazil\u2019s domestic affairs. \u201cThis tomfoolery stops right here!\u201d Bolsonaro proclaimed, praising Donald Trump\u2019s approval of the Dakota Access and Keystone XL oil pipelines. Bolsonaro returned to that theme on Tuesday during a gathering of car dealers in Brazil\u2019s economic capital, S\u00e3o Paulo, complaining that \u201c60% of our territory is rendered unusable by indigenous reserves and other environmental questions\u201d. \u201cYou can\u2019t imagine how much I enjoyed talking to Macron and Angela Merkel [about these issues during the recent G20 in Japan],\u201d Bolsonaro added to guffaws from the crowd. \u201cWhat a pleasure!\u201d In June Merkel described the environmental situation in Bolsonaro\u2019s Brazil as \u201cdramatic\u201d. In recent weeks the globally respected National Institute for Space Research has found itself at the eye of a political storm as a result of the inconvenient truths revealed by its data. Earlier this month, with alarm growing about the consequences of the intensifying assault on the Amazon, its director, Ricardo Galv\u00e3o, was sacked after contesting Bolsonaro\u2019s \u201cpusillanimous\u201d claims he was peddling lies about the state of the Amazon. Galv\u00e3o\u2019s successor, the air force colonel Darcton Policarpo Dami\u00e3o, looks set to follow a more Bolsonarian line. In an interview this week Dami\u00e3o said he was not convinced global heating was a manmade phenomenon and called such matters \u201cnot my cup of tea\u201d. Pope Francis \u2013 who is preparing to host a special synod on the Amazon in October \u2013 has also incurred Bolsonaro\u2019s wrath on the environment. In June the Argentinian leader of the Catholic church questioned \u201cthe blind and destructive mentality\u201d of those seeking to profit from the world\u2019s biggest rainforest. \u201cWhat is happening in Amazonia will have repercussions at a global level,\u201d he warned. Asked about those comments, Bolsonaro offered a characteristically unvarnished response, suggesting they reflected an international conspiracy to commandeer the Amazon. \u201cBrazil is the virgin that every foreign pervert wants to get their hands on,\u201d Bolsonaro said.",

I met my surgeon at the beginning of June and was put on the NHS surgery waiting list.</p> <p>I can cope with the physical pain. But I really struggle to deal with the distress and anxiety of being on what seems like a never-ending waiting list. The maximum wait for my surgery is supposed to be 18 weeks. To even get to this point has involved months of waiting for scans and appointments. Last month\u2019s figures show a <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/nhs-waiting-list-ae-pensions-summer-crisis-a9000701.html\" title=\"\">record high</a> of 4.4 million people are now waiting for routine surgery, and I\u2019m saddened to say that I no longer have faith I will be treated within the target time.</p> <p>But it\u2019s not just routine treatments. For cancer surgeries, the situation is devastating. Waiting times for receiving treatment for cancer have risen, with almost 34,000 people waiting too long for treatment. NHS England aims to ensure that <a href=\"https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/06/Cancer-Waiting-Times-Annual-Report-201617-1.pdf\" title=\"\">94% of cancer patients</a> requiring surgery should should have it within 31 days of the decision to treat. This target has been missed consistently since August 2018. Meanwhile, cancer continues to take lives in the interim. Dany Bell, a treatment and recovery specialist adviser at Macmillan Cancer Support, told me: \u201cI\u2019ve heard first-hand from doctors and nurses about how patients are becoming increasingly distressed by further delays while they anxiously wait for surgery to treat their cancer. They don\u2019t feel that they can move forward until their treatment is under way.\u201d</p> <p>The mental anguish during the wait for surgery is something I had never expected to feel. It\u2019s hard enough finding out there is something wrong with your body, but learning that you have to wait for an unknown amount of time to get it fixed is unbearable. I\u2019ve found myself on edge with anxiety, enduring many sleepless nights. Being unwell takes up time and money, because patients\u2019 work schedules must be punctuated with appointments. I\u2019m in my mid-20s, wanting to throw myself into my career and get on with my life. Instead, I\u2019m tormented by physical pain and emotional anguish.</p> <p>The link between our physical and mental health becomes all the more potent when awaiting surgery. Pain, severe fatigue and a life interrupted by illness create the perfect cocktail for extreme stress and anxiety. Yet this is often forgotten during the surgery wait. Geoff Heyes, head of health policy and influencing at Mind, says: \u201cIt seems obvious that being diagnosed with and undergoing treatment for a serious physical illness is going to have an impact on someone\u2019s mental wellbeing but too often they are treated separately, without much attention given to the person as a whole.\u201d Cuts across the NHS really don\u2019t take this into account.</p> <p>Our NHS doctors and nurses work tirelessly so that when you are eventually seen, you are given some of the world\u2019s best care. But realising that they currently do not have the resources to give you that care is unsettling. They are contending with a backlog of patients in pain. They need to make sure they have a full team of medical staff for each operation, as well as ensuring the patient will have a bed after theatre.

      "bodyText": "My weekend was spent at the Edinburgh fringe watching standup comedians that I love, while sitting curled up in my seat with heat pads stuck to my skin. This isn\u2019t ideal in summer, but I needed the heat pressed against my left side to drown out the agonising pain I often experience. The only way I can describe it is that it feels like my organs are being squeezed as tightly as possible. In February, I learned that my left kidney is damaged. I have a pelvic ureteric junction obstruction, meaning that one kidney doesn\u2019t filter properly. Instead, it fills up like a balloon ready to explode inside me. In some cases, this can be treated with a stent. Unfortunately for me, I\u2019ve (unknowingly) had it for so long that it has caused the kidney to swell to the point where it is now badly damaged and needs surgery.

The world has a funny way of working things out, many people think I\u2019m a bad person - as I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll be many nasty comments left under this post by keyboard warriors a plenty. But I met a girl who seriously swept me off my feet and in a time of hardship showed me love, a deep devoted love. People will say we are mad or crazy or even fools, as @snackyjax and I had only been dating seriously for a little over 2 weeks before deciding to get married. But when someone like her comes in to your life, why would I wait? \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f The people who needed to know, such as close family and friends were told before anyone else and they are happy for me including my beautiful X wife @unahealy who I love even more for her blessing.  Life is short and you only get one and it\u2019s worth living. Jackie is the greatest human being I\u2019ve ever come across - she\u2019s beautiful inside and out, intelligent, charming, funny, generous, kind, gentle, energetic the list goes on. \ud83d\ude0a She will be a great step mum to Aoife and Tadhg and offers me a future I can\u2019t wait to explore with her. My heart is full and I honestly couldn\u2019t be happier, so those that want to bring negativity or try and tear me down go ahead. My life is great and I hope you all will one day feel happiness like i feel while I write this caption. I love you @snackyjax I can\u2019t wait to see where our lives lead together you brought excitement and joy to my life and I couldn\u2019t be prouder having stand at my side as Mrs Foden. (BTW the witness is Jackie\u2019s sister @leila.bela thanks you too hun for being a legend) #Love</a></p> <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A post shared by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ben_foden/\" style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;\" target=\"_blank\"> Ben Foden</a> (@ben_foden) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2019-08-06T12:45:33+00:00\">Aug 6, 2019 at 5:45am PDT</time></p></div></blockquote> <script async src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"></script> </figure>  <p>Can a relationship in which both parties have known each other for less time than I have been meaning to take the recycling out really go the distance?</p> <p>\u201cIt is very rare that we see people marrying this quickly,\u201d says Professor Brienna Perelli-Harris of the University of Southampton, an expert on demographic trends in marriage and cohabitation.

When he decided to quit Invesco and go it alone in 2013 it was a huge shock for the fund management industry. Invesco shares slumped by 7% on the day he announced his departure.</p>\n    <p>At Invesco Woodford held control of huge stakes in some of the UK\u2019s biggest firms, and his opinions mattered. His criticism of AstraZeneca chief executive David Brennan in the 2012 shareholder spring was widely regarded to have cost him his job, and his critique of BAE\u2019s attempted \u00a328bn merger with Airbus is acknowledged as one of the reasons the deal collapsed.</p>\n    <p>Woodford, who was widely referred to in the media as an investment \u201chero\u201d and fund management \u201cstar\u201d, had done exceedingly well over his quarter century there. A \u00a31,000 investment placed when he started at the firm in 1988 would have risen to \u00a323,000 by the time he left.</p>\n    <p>Woodford accidentally fell into fund management and hadn\u2019t heard of the term until he rocked up in the City in the 1980s sleeping on his brother\u2019s floor while looking for a job. He got his first break in insurance, before drifting into fund management. He had left school wanting to fly fighter jets but couldn\u2019t pass the RAF\u2019s aptitude test, and instead read economics and agricultural economics at the University of Exeter.</p>\n    <p>Feeling he had outgrown Invesco Perpetual, he set up his own firm Woodford Investment Management in 2014, on an industrial estate near Oxford. Within two weeks of launching, he had raised \u00a31.6bn, a UK record, and it quickly grew to \u00a316bn. In its first full year his flagship fund returned 16% and Woodford, a devotee of veteran US investor Warren Buffett, was dubbed the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-27/oracle-of-oxford-sees-red-as-stock-picking-powers-misfire\">\u201cOracle of Oxford\u201d</a>.</p>\n    <p>Asked if he ever doubted his judgment, Woodford once said: \u201cDaily. You must never, as a fund manager, stick your head in the sand saying \u2018everybody go away, I\u2019m right, I\u2019m right, I\u2019m right\u2019. You\u2019ve always got to expose yourself to criticism and the analysis that you may be wrong.\u201d</p>\n    <p>Woodford went on to say that the secret of successful fund management was a balance of arrogance and humility. \u201cYou have to have a sufficiently strong arrogant gene to back your judgment, back your conviction. If you didn\u2019t, you would end up with a portfolio that looks very much like the index. But, equally, you must have the humility to accept that you will get things wrong.\u201d</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/rupertneate\"><b>Rupert Neate</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Burford, which is chaired by the former Barclays boss and Treasury mandarin Sir Peter Middleton, had been one of the strongest performing stocks in Woodford\u2019s portfolio.</p> \n<p>The fund manager, who was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/jun/03/neil-woodford-blocks-investors-from-pulling-cash-from-flagship-fund\">forced to shut his Woodford equity income fund</a> in June following a surge in redemptions, holds a 7% stake in Burford.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/jun/04/neil-woodford-fund-manager\">Woodford\u2019s former employer</a>, Invesco, is Burford\u2019s largest shareholder with a 14% stake in the business.</p> \n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.muddywatersresearch.com/research/bur/mw-is-short/\">letter by Muddy Waters</a> released on Wednesday confirmed its short position and claimed that Burford was a \u201cpoor business masquerading as a great one\u201d.</p> \n<p>The US hedge fund criticised the way Burford measured returns on its investments, saying they were \u201cheavily manipulated and greatly misled investors\u201d and that much of its profit since 2012 had come from just four legal cases.</p> \n<p>The attack caused Burford shares to slump from \u00a313.95 on Tuesday afternoon to just 428p per share by midday on Wednesday.

Burford\u2019s shares are still up 300% since Woodford\u2019s first investment in June 2014. However, the \u00a3120m reduction in the value of the gated fund comes as he is trying to raise money by cashing in some of its holdings.

At Edgbaston he may have given them too many: a squad of 14, containing seven seamers. Root and Bayliss were like children in an ice-cream parlour, spurning all the sharp flavours \u2013 Archer\u2019s polished pace, Olly Stone\u2019s raw power, Sam Curran\u2019s left-arm swing \u2013 in favour of vanilla, mid-80s right-armers.

The first XI almost pick themselves: Burns, Roy, Root, Stokes (bowling less because batting at four), Buttler, Bairstow, Curran, Woakes, Archer, Broad, Leach.

He managed 5 and 1 in the first Test, joining Bairstow and Moeen in the melancholy club of gifted strokemakers who have yet to reach double figures in a Test this summer.

Buttler, since his recall in May 2018, remains second only to Root for Test runs and top of the class for Test fifties (nine, to Root\u2019s six), and he recovered from an equally poor start last year.

      "bodyText": "OH FAW! HOW COULD YOU! It\u2019s long been a sly trick performed by governments who don\u2019t want you to know what\u2019s going on: slip out some bad news on a day when something big is occupying hearts and minds. It\u2019s classic misdirection. So as football fans everywhere obsess about the transfer window, which slams shut on Thursday evening, and prepare to either belly-laugh at or suddenly get very worried about Spurs and/or Everton and/or Manchester United, the FA of Wales today confessed that they\u2019ve needlessly wasted tons of cash on a pointless second brand revamp in less than a decade. O Cymdeithas B\u00eal-droed Cymru! Sut allech chi! At least that\u2019s what The Fiver assumes the idea is, because otherwise there\u2019s no rational explanation for the short marketing film released online today which insisted that \u201cto be Welsh is to feel the blood pound in your veins\u201d. The blood did indeed start pounding in The Fiver\u2019s veins, specifically the temples, as our hackles began to rise. Wales has been by all accounts \u201cbuilt on centuries of grit, resilience and determination\u201d, which is faintly ironic given the replacement badge they\u2019ve unveiled gives off an extremely strong whiff of \u201cRight, I\u2019m off for lunch, see you tomorrow.\u201d The expensive new design nobody asked for? A red dragon. It\u2019s a creature that\u2019s featured on the Welsh shirt since 1880, if you want to gauge exactly how much deep thought has gone into this particular creative endeavour. To be scrupulously fair to top branding consultancy Will This Do?, they\u2019ve tweaked him a little bit, just in case anybody asks what the hell they\u2019ve been up to. In heraldic terms, the beast was traditionally salient and facing the dexter side - i.e. looking to our left with its forelegs in the air - but now it looks the other way in startled fashion, like a child rumbled as it reaches for the cookie jar, or a farmer performing a double-take as someone tells him none of the money the EU used to invest in the country will be matched by the Tories when we\u2019re out. It\u2019s all a bit of a mess, truth told, although let the record state that some good has come out of the process. Members of the public were asked what words sprang to mind whenever they saw the FAW crest.

I\u2019ve ridden from London to Anglesey and back this week, and nodded so much my neck hurts. It\u2019s a beautiful pain. \u2022 Adrian Chiles is a writer, broadcaster and Guardian columnist",

The government and the agency must deliver a fair pay rise. Staff who work hard to maintain vital flood responses and protect the public are simply not prepared to accept another financial blow.\u201d</p> <p>The union said actions would be suspended if staff received what they deem to be a fair increase in pay from the Environment Agency.</p> <p>The non-departmental public body has lost almost 1,000 members of staff who have been transferred to the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), its sponsor, since July 2016 as part of efforts to save the department \u00a3124m. Unison suggested that cuts to the Environment Agency\u2019s budget mean it may not be able to afford any prospective increase to staff salaries without a funding injection.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/feb/19/thames-barrier-how-safe-london-major-flood-at-risk\">Beyond the Thames Barrier: how safe is London from another major flood?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Thames Barrier covers 520 metres (1,700ft) across the river, protecting London from flooding in the event of surges in the tide.</p> <p>More than half a million homes, the Houses of Parliament, Canary Wharf and 16 hospitals are among the attractions, transport infrastructure and institutions on an \u201cat risk\u201d list.

      "bodyText": "Staff at the Thames Barrier, one of the largest movable flood barriers in the world, could escalate their dispute over pay with the Environment Agency after three months of industrial action. Unison, the public service union, said real-terms pay had consistently fallen over the past decade for its members working at the Thames Barrier in London, and so it was considering asking them to withdraw from incident response cover for a longer period in September. However, this would fall short of strike action, as the workers would be completing all the normal hours in their contracts while refusing to take on non-mandatory additional jobs. Members of Unison employed by the Environment Agency have already been withdrawing from incident response rosters on one or two days a week as part of efforts to force an improvement to their 2018 pay offer, which the union said gave an average 1.3% pay rise to those not working in nuclear teams. Unison said this amounted to the 10th year of pay cuts. \u201cThis pay settlement imposed on staff was another slap in the face for staff who have been hit hard by a decade of austerity, and amounts to a real-terms pay cut,\u201d said Unison\u2019s national officer for water, environment and transport, Andrew Dobbie. \u201cEmployees do not take action lightly but will not do work above and beyond what is in their contracts. The government and the agency must deliver a fair pay rise. Staff who work hard to maintain vital flood responses and protect the public are simply not prepared to accept another financial blow.\u201d The union said actions would be suspended if staff received what they deem to be a fair increase in pay from the Environment Agency. The non-departmental public body has lost almost 1,000 members of staff who have been transferred to the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), its sponsor, since July 2016 as part of efforts to save the department \u00a3124m. Unison suggested that cuts to the Environment Agency\u2019s budget mean it may not be able to afford any prospective increase to staff salaries without a funding injection. The Thames Barrier covers 520 metres (1,700ft) across the river, protecting London from flooding in the event of surges in the tide. More than half a million homes, the Houses of Parliament, Canary Wharf and 16 hospitals are among the attractions, transport infrastructure and institutions on an \u201cat risk\u201d list. There have been heightened fears of flooding across the country recently following extreme weather and heavy downpours. An Environment Agency spokesman said: \u201cWe have robust arrangements to ensure that the Thames Barrier can continue to operate as necessary to protect London against the risk of flooding.\u201d Unison said that all its 3,000 members in the Environment Agency were involved in just working to their contract. There are reportedly 80 members of staff at the Thames Barrier.",

The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the \u00a339bn divorce payment.</p>\n      <p>The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods.</p>\n      <p>The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports \u2013 making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO \u201cmost favoured nation\u201d rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.<br></p>\n      <p>WTO rules only cover goods \u2013 they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK\u2019s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.<br></p>\n      <p>Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article 24 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to 10 years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article 24 unilaterally \u2013 the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK\u2019s trading relationship.<br></p>\n      <p>The director general of the WTO, Roberto Azev\u00eado, has <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/economics-and-finance/jumping-from-league-one-to-league-three-wto-insiders-scathing-assessments-of-a-wto-brexit\">told Prospect magazine</a> that \u201cin simple factual terms in this scenario, you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the UK and EU where currently there are none\u201d.</p>\n      <p>Until some agreements are in place, a no-deal scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses \u2013 eg the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europe after 31 October if there is no deal. Those arguing for a \u201cmanaged\u201d no deal envisage that a range of smaller, sector-by-sector, bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.</p>\n      <p><b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a></b></p>\n      <p></p>\n     </div>\n    </div>\n   </gu-atom> \n  </figure> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/aug/07/no-deal-brexit-call-to-suspend-competition-law-to-avert-food-shortages\">No-deal Brexit: pause competition law to avoid food shortages, say manufacturers</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9cdb874f60011aa1beeb67d83f01c737f89d45a9\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9cdb874f60011aa1beeb67d83f01c737f89d45a9/0_139_3273_1965/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A fruit stall displays fruit at a market in London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The government has not yet confirmed that companies would be able to work together to direct supplies, the food and Drink Federation says.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kirsty Wigglesworth/AP</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-08-07T13:57:28.667Z\">at 2.57pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d4ab9ef8f0896be8f8f4e28\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-07T11:57:10.574Z\">12.57pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>About $14 trillion of government debt now offers negative yields (interest rates) and US government bonds could soon follow suit due to the escalating US-China trade war, says Joachim Fels, a global economic adviser for the Californian investment firm Pimco. <em><a href=\"https://blog.pimco.com/en/2019/08/interest-rates-naturally-negative\">He writes on his blog</a></em>:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It is no longer absurd to think that the nominal yield on US Treasury securities could go negative.

      "bodyText": "Spot gold \u2013 seen as a safe-haven investment \u2013 has just gone through $1,500 an ounce for the first time in more than six years, as financial markets remain jittery. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones has fallen 2.24% to 25,446 while the Nasdaq is down 1.72% and the S&amp;P 500 has lost 1.88%. In London, the FTSE 100 has turned negative, falling 15 points, or 0.2%, to 7,156. Most major European markets have also slipped into the red, with the exception of Germany\u2019s Dax, which is up 0.1% at 11,571. France\u2019s CAC 40 down 0.05% at 5,231 Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB down 0.97% at 20,431 Spain\u2019s Ibex down 0.18% at 8,683 Traders have also been rushing into the safety of government bonds as fears of a global downturn in the wake of trade disputes gripped markets. Andrew Brenner, managing director at National Alliance Capital Markets, told Reuters: Bonds are being bought in a panic mode. Earlier, European stock markets staged a recovery following a three-day sell-off, as investors were cheered by White House assurances that the next round of trade talks with China would still go ahead in September. They shrugged off weak German industrial production data that raised fears of a second-quarter contraction (and possibly recession) in Europe\u2019s biggest economy. The central banks of New Zealand, India and Thailand all cut interest rates today to prop up their countries\u2019 faltering economies. Thank you for all your comments. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Gold has been hovering at six-year highs in the last few days, as investors have been seeking out safer investments as the US-China trade war escalated. Spot gold has hit $1,500 an ounce for the first time in more than six years, rising to $1,505.51. On Wall Street, stocks have opened lower. Dow Jones down 331 points, or 1.27%, at 25,698 S&amp;P 500 down 30 points, or 1.05%, at 2,851 Nasdaq down 82 points, or 1%, at 7,750 Returning to the theme of government bonds: fears over a global downturn have driven US Treasury yields lower, with 30-year yields close to record lows. The 30-year yield fell as low as 2.145%, not far from an all-time low of 2.089% set in July 2016, according to Refinitiv data. Britain\u2019s food and drinks industry body has called on the government to suspend competition law in the event of a no-deal Brexit, so companies can work together and co-ordinate supply decisions to avoid food shortages. My colleague Jasper Jolly writes: Britain\u2019s food and drinks industry has said companies may have to choose between working together to avert food shortages or paying large fines unless the government steps in to suspend competition law in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Collaboration between large companies is controlled to prevent cartels harming consumers. The Food and Drink Federation (FDF) told the BBC that the government had not yet confirmed that companies would be able to work together to direct food supplies if there were delays as a result of crashing out of the EU. About $14 trillion of government debt now offers negative yields (interest rates) and US government bonds could soon follow suit due to the escalating US-China trade war, says Joachim Fels, a global economic adviser for the Californian investment firm Pimco. He writes on his blog: It is no longer absurd to think that the nominal yield on US Treasury securities could go negative. Last week the German 30-year government bond yield dipped into negative territory for the first time ever. Around $14 trillion of outstanding bonds worldwide, or 25% of the market, now trade at negative yields, according to Bloomberg. What was once viewed as a short-term aberration \u2013 that creditors are paying debtors for taking their money \u2013 has already become commonplace in developed markets outside of the US. Whenever the world economy next goes into hibernation, US Treasuries \u2013 which many investors view as the ultimate \u201csafe haven\u201d apart from gold \u2013 may be no exception to the negative yield phenomenon. And if trade tensions keep escalating, bond markets may move in that direction faster than many investors think. New Zealand\u2019s central bank surprised markets with a half-point rate cut this morning to rekindle sluggish growth, and a suggestion that rates could even go below zero. The Bank of India then delivered its fourth rate reduction this year, cutting its key lending rate to the lowest level in nine years to prop up the country\u2019s faltering economy. And the Bank of Thailand also cut its benchmark interest rate, for the first time since 2015 to support growth and weaken the strong baht. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst UK &amp; EMEA at trading platform Oanda, says: We\u2019re seeing a bit of a rebound in early European trade on Wednesday, with US futures also a little higher as markets take a breather from the recent sell-off. It\u2019s too early to even try and associate this with any form of optimism given the events of the last week, while the size of the rebound compared to the days before gives it more an appearance of a dead cat bounce than anything else. There\u2019s been a lot to digest and I wonder whether investors are simply taking a step back and doing just that. We\u2019ve seen rate cuts overnight from the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, Reserve Bank of India and Bank of Thailand that have all exceeded market expectations which may be helping the rebound, given investors craving for more and more monetary stimulus. It may not yet be coming from the central banks they demand it from most but the mood is clearly shifting. European shares have recovered after a three-day sell-off, after the White House softened its rhetoric in its trade war with Beijing. Senior adviser Larry Kudlow said the Trump administration was still planning to host a Chinese delegation for talks in September. The FTSE 100 index in London is 63 points ahead at 7,235, a 0.88% gain. Europe\u2019s Stoxx 600 climbed nearly 1%, as all major bourses rose. Germany\u2019s Dax up 1.53% at 11,744 France\u2019s CAC 40 up 1.37% at 5,306 Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB up 0.7% at 20,776 Spain\u2019s Ibex up 1.17% at 8,801 However, gold, the Japanese yen and government debt \u2013 considered safe-haven assets \u2013 are still in demand, as markets stay cautious amid lingering trade tensions. Spot gold has gained 0.9% and, at $1,487 an ounce, is heading towards $1,500. It hit $1,490.84 at one stage, its highest level since April 2013. Yields on long-dated government bonds fell across the eurozone, with the German and Dutch yields hitting record lows in negative territory, after weak German industrial production and the bigger-than-expected interest rate cut in New Zealand reignited a rally in bond markets (when bond prices go up, yields fall). Germany\u2019s benchmark 10-year bond yield slid to -0.58% while the Dutch equivalent fell to -0.478%. The British Airways IT glitch has caused chaos for passengers wanting to travel from London to their holiday destinations. Tell us if you have been affected. The pound is declining again today and is trading close to two-year lows versus the dollar and the euro. It is down 0.21% against the dollar at $1.2145, not far from the 31-month low of $1.2080 reached last week. Against the euro, sterling is 0.12% lower at \u20ac1.0855, not far from the 23-month low hit yesterday. The risk of a no-deal Brexit has increased markedly under Boris Johnson\u2019s government. When he became prime minister a fortnight ago, he said he would take Britain out of the EU at the end of October \u201cdo or die\u201d. Divisions between the UK and the EU have become more entrenched, with No 10 seemingly intent on a no-deal departure \u2013 while Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister who is in charge of no-deal preparations, has accused the EU of intransigence over Brexit talks. Investors are also fretting about the possibility of a no-confidence vote in the new Conservative government after the summer recess, or an early general election. Derek Halpenny, head of research at the Japanese bank Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, told Reuters: There are many key dates ahead for sterling, but the passing of 5 September without a successful of no confidence in the government will in our view be a further important step along the road of a no-deal Brexit on 31 October. The mood in financial markets is still fragile. Oil prices have hit a fresh seven-month low as traders worried about the impact of the US-China trade war on the global economy. Brent crude, the global benchmark, fell nearly 2% to $58.57 a barrel earlier this morning and is now trading down 0.2% at $58.82 a barrel. Prices have tumbled more than 20% since hitting their 2019 peak in April. The bounce on European bourses this morning come after three days of declines. Shares in Germany and the pan-European Stoxx 600 \u2013 which is up 0.75% \u2013 have been boosted by a deal in the chemicals sector involving German giant Bayer. There was also relief globally after the White House gave assurances last night that it wants to press ahead with trade negotiations with Beijing, after both sides ramped up their rhetoric in recent days. On Friday, Donald Trump announced fresh 10% tariffs on $300bn of Chinese imports, whereupon the People\u2019s Bank of China let the yuan fall beyond the symbolic seven-to-one-dollar mark on Monday, for the first time since May 2008. This led to the US Treasury department labelling Beijing a currency manipulator. China strongly rejected this and warned it would destroy the international order and lead to chaos in financial markets, but acted to prop up its currency yesterday. Larry Kudlow, director of the White House National Economic Council, told CNBC last night that the Trump administration was still planning to host a Chinese delegation for trade talks in September. Tensions remain, however. The Chinese currency has weakened again today and is trading at 7.0455 per dollar, down 0.3% on the day. There is a sense of relief in equity markets this morning, as the standoff between the US and China appears to have eased. The FTSE 100 in London has turned positive. UK\u2019s FTSE 100 up 35 points, or 0.49%, at 7,207 Germany\u2019s Dax up 1.27% at 11,815 France\u2019s CAC 40 up 0.9% at 5,281 Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB up 0.44% at 20,723 Spain\u2019s Ibex up 0.78% at 8,767 Joshua Elash, director of property lender MT Finance, says: The market is flat and house prices are down again month-on-month, but the shift is relatively small. However, there is a risk that come the autumn, the robustness of the property market will be put to the test. If Brexit or deflationary forces lead to the Bank of England increasing the base rate, there will be consequential pressure on homeowners to sell as they struggle to deal with meeting the cost of increased mortgage payments. In this scenario we would expect to see more significant downward pressure on prices. Here is some instant reaction to the Halifax house price figures, which showed a 0.2% drop in July. Jeremy Leaf, a north London estate agent and a former Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors residential chairman, says: The Halifax figures always command respect, not least because they are well-established and have a good track record of accuracy. They confirm what we are seeing on the ground - that there has been no real change to house prices recently and no significant change is expected as buyers, in particular, seem to be looking beyond Brexit irrespective of the outcome. Prices are being underpinned by shortage of stock, improving affordability and low mortgage rates. What is more important is the number of transactions, which remain sluggish and protracted as sellers reluctantly come to terms with new market realities. An IT glitch has affected online check-in at British Airways, leading to long queues at check-in desks, flight cancellations and delays. London\u2019s Heathrow, Gatwick and City airports are affected by the glitch. My colleague Jasper Jolly writes: The airline said it has moved to back-up manual systems to keep some flights operating. British Airways said it was offering customers the chance to move bookings to another travel day between 8-13 August. About half of the British Airways flights scheduled to depart from Heathrow\u2019s terminal five between 9.30am and midday were cancelled or delayed, according to the airport\u2019s website. House prices in the UK have fallen for a second month, according to Halifax, one of Britain\u2019s biggest mortgage lenders. The average price of a home dropped 0.2% in July from June to \u00a3236,120, while the annual growth rate slowed to 4.1% from 5.7%. In June, prices fell by 0.4%. Russell Galley, managing director at Halifax, said: The average UK house price fell slightly for a second month, as the market continues to tread water with marginal increases or decreases in each monthly period. That said, it\u2019s worth remembering that while economic uncertainty continues to weigh on the market, the overall trend actually remains one of comparative stability, with average prices down by less than \u00a3600 over the last three months. We have seen a reported drop off in the number of properties sold during the early months of summer, which may lead some to speculate a downturn is on the horizon. However, new buyer enquiries are up, and favourable mortgage affordability \u2013 driven by low interest rates and strong wage growth \u2013 should continue to underpin prices for the time being. In the longer-term, we believe there is unlikely to be a step change in market activity until buyers and sellers see some form of resolution to the current economic uncertainty. The poor German industrial production figures have raised the spectre of a recession, according to some economists. The German economy is widely expected to have at best ground to a halt in the second quarter, following 0.4% growth in the first quarter. The German government expects the economy to grow just 0.5% this year, picking up to 1.5% next year. Andreas Scheuerle from DekaBank expects an economic contraction of 0.2% in the second quarter. We assume that this is the prelude to a technical recession. A technical recession is defined as at least two consecutive quarters of contraction. Preliminary figures for the second quarter, from April to June, will be released next Wednesday by the German Federal Statistics Office. The FTSE 100 index in London is trading 7 points lower after the open, slipping 0.1% to 7164. Meanwhile, European shares are higher in early trading. Germany\u2019s Dax up 0.6% France\u2019s CAC 40 up 0.3% Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB up 0.18% Spain\u2019s Ibex up 0.5% Andrew Kenningham, chief Europe economist at Capital Economics, says the fall in German production has killed off hopes of a recovery in the third quarter. Germany relies heavily on exports, and has been hit hard by trade disputes. The breakdown shows that the fall was fairly broad-based, affecting all major sectors except for construction, where output was up marginally. Business surveys uniformly point to a further contraction in July, so things look set to get worse rather than better \u2013 even if the US refrains from imposing tariffs on the EU and a no-deal Brexit is avoided. In the second quarter as a whole, German industrial output fell by 1.8% compared with the previous quarter, driven by steep declines in metal production, machinery and car manufacturing. Carsten Brzeski, chief economist at ING Germany, says the slump bodes ill for GDP growth in the second quarter. Looking ahead, despite yesterday\u2019s encouraging industrial orders data, the combination of high inventories and few orders at hand does not bode well for industrial production in the months ahead. Add to this a further escalation of the current trade conflicts, Brexit and an ongoing structural transformation in the automotive sector and the outlook doesn\u2019t look any better. Against this background, recent tentative signs that the domestic economy\u2019s resilience is crumbling are concerning. All in all, we would characterise today\u2019s industrial production report as devastating, with no silver lining. Today\u2019s data also shows that we should prepare for contraction in the German economy in the second quarter, unless exports bring an unexpected surprise on Friday. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Markets remain on tenterhooks as the standoff between the US and China in their prolonged trade dispute continues. Following a two-day sell-off in global stock markets, the mood lightened yesterday after the Chinese central bank fixed the yuan at a slightly firmer rate, while strongly rejecting Washington\u2019s branding of Beijing as a currency manipulator. European stocks traded higher for most of the day but closed lower. The FTSE 100 index in London was under more pressure as the pound strengthened, and fell 0.72%. Wall Street staged a recovery, with the Dow Jones rising 1.2% and the S&amp;P 500 gaining 1.3%. Donald Trump hinted strongly yesterday that he was ready to dig in for the long term in the trade war, tweeting he was prepared to provide support for US farmers in 2020 should they face pressure from China. German figures out this morning showed a monthly fall of 1.5% in industrial production in June, far steeper than the 0.4% drop predicted by economists and compared with 0.1% growth in May. This adds to signs that Europe\u2019s biggest economy shrank in the second quarter, which will act as a drag on the eurozone. Andrew Kenningham, chief Europe economist at Capital Economics, says: The 1.5% fall in German industrial production in June kills off any hopes that the strong orders data published yesterday marked the beginning of a recovery. Asian shares fell for an eighth day, with Japan\u2019s Nikkei losing 0.33% while Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng slipped 0.09%. New Zealand\u2019s central bank stunned markets by cutting interest rates by a half-point to 1% and said rates could even go below zero. Looking ahead to the European opening, Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at trading platform Oanda, says: European futures are looking a little flat ahead of the open on Wednesday as investors watch on nervously for any further escalation in the trade war between the US and China. We\u2019ve gone from being hopeful a couple of weeks ago that talks in Shanghai would aid progress towards a deal and the removal of tariffs, to new tariffs, China no longer buying US agricultural goods and the US labelling China a currency manipulator. That\u2019s some escalation in a little over a week. The agenda 8:30am BST: UK Halifax house prices (July)",

The woman later killed herself after two attempts during the trial. \u201cAs a 36-year-old father of daughters and person of faith, I look back on that time as a teenager and can say without hesitation that I should have used more wisdom,\u201d Parker said in a Facebook post. The Birth of a Nation, which was receiving mixed reviews along the festival circuit, ended up incurring massive losses for Fox and Parker disappeared from the spotlight. This year\u2019s festival will also see the premieres of a Joker origins drama starring Joaquin Phoenix, James Gray\u2019s sci-fi epic Ad Astra starring Brad Pitt and a new film from Roman Polanski.",

But being gentle and soft enough to avoid damaging fruit or flesh has made the robots prone to damage and left them largely impractical for use in the real world \u2013 until now. A European commission-funded project, led by scientists at the Free University of Brussels and the University of Cambridge, aims to create \u201cself-healing\u201d robots that can feel pain, or sense damage, before swiftly patching themselves up without human intervention. The researchers have already successfully developed polymers that can heal themselves by creating new bonds after about 40 minutes. The next step will be to embed sensor fibres in the polymer which can detect where the damage is located. The end goal is to make the healing automated, avoiding the current need for heat to activate the system, through the touch of a human hand. Prof Bram Vanderborght, from the Free University of Brussels (Vrije Universiteit Brussel), who is managing the project, said the research was at the forefront of developing a new generation of robotics. He said: \u201cOver the past few years, we have already taken the first steps in creating self-healing materials for robots. \u201cWith this research we want to continue and, above all, ensure that robots that are used in our working environment are safer, but also more sustainable.

The cost of robot replacement parts is said to be in excess of \u00a3320m a year. The self-healing project is seeking to create what it describes as \u201canthropomorphic materials, capable of feeling pain\u201d. Developing soft robotic systems with autonomous self-healing polymers then excludes the need of additional heating devices and costs. Depending on the extent and location of the damage, trials so far suggest the healing can take only second or up to a week in room temperature conditions. Cambridge University is working alongside the Free University of Brussels and the Ecole Sup\u00e9rieure de Physique et de Chimie Industrielles, in Paris, the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology, and the Dutch polymer manufacturer SupraPolix.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump has criticised the New York Times after the newspaper was forced to change its front-page headline amid an intense backlash over its sympathetic portrayal of the president\u2019s statement on the mass shootings in Texas and Ohio that left 31 people dead. The headline, which first splashed across page the front page in the New York Times print edition Tuesday, read \u201cTrump urges unity vs racism\u201d. The headline was changed to \u201cAssailing hate but not guns\u201d, in the paper\u2019s second edition, but the change failed to quell the uproar. Many readers complained that the wording fed Trump\u2019s claims that those who criticised his persistent anti-immigrant and racist rhetoric \u2013 some of which was repeated in the El Paso gunman\u2019s alleged manifesto \u2013 were playing politics. Trump blamed \u201cthe glorification of violence\u201d in a speech that identified video games, the internet and mental illness \u2013 but not guns \u2013 as the cause of the slaughter that left at least 31 dead and 53 injured in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, in less than 24 hours over the weekend. He did not address the criticisms of his own divisive rhetoric. On Wednesday Trump praised the initial headline in a tweet, saying it \u201cwas the correct description\u2026 by the Failing New York Times\u201d. He said the paper was forced to change the description because \u201cRadical Left Democrats went absolutely CRAZY! Fake News - That\u2019s what we\u2019re up against...\u201d Trump is expected to face a backlash when he visits El Paso and Dayton on Wednesday, to meet with officials, first responders and members of the community. Authorities are investigating the El Paso shooting as domestic terrorism, while the Dayton shooting is being treated as homicide. The executive editor of the New York Times accepted responsibility after the paper changed its headline. The headline appeared in the print edition of the New York Times, which Dean Baquet said has become less of a focus for the paper\u2019s leadership, known as the masthead within the industry. \u201cThe print hub is not right in the middle of the news desk anymore,\u201d Baquet told the Columbia Journalism Review (CJR). \u201cI don\u2019t lay out the page. I don\u2019t pick the front-page stories. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the role of the executive editor anymore.\u201d He added: \u201cIt\u2019s important for me to say, if anyone is at fault, the executive editor is at fault,\u201d and said: \u201cIt didn\u2019t have enough skepticism of what the president said.\u201d The headline failed to capture the \u201creasons to be skeptical\u201d of Trump\u2019s call for Americans to come together following the shootings, and white supremacy as an \u201cevident problem\u201d, Baquet told the CJR. Leading up to the shootings, Trump was under intense criticism for racist comments directed to four congresswomen of color. He tweeted the women should \u201cgo back\u201d to where they came from, a longtime racist trope. All but one of the women was born in the United States. Many people complained the headline legitimized Trump\u2019s supporters, who argued critics were playing politics rather than rightfully denouncing inflammatory anti-immigrant sentiment. Trump\u2019s rhetoric was quoted in a screed by a shooter in El Paso. The headline first gained widespread attention when it was tweeted by the prominent statistician Nate Silver, of the website FiveThirtyEight, which was previously published by the New York Times. The headline also lead to criticism by 2020 Democratic presidential candidates, including the New York senator Kirsten Gillibrand, who tweeted: \u201cThat\u2019s not what happened\u201d, and the New Jersey senator Cory Booker. The furor has also lead to calls on social media to cancel subscriptions to the New York Times. A spokesperson for the newspaper conceded to CJR the outlet was experiencing a \u201chigher volume of cancellations\u201d than is \u201ctypical\u201d. The uproar spotlighted how newsrooms\u2019 focus has shifted from print editions to digital, and the rift between Times readers\u2019 expectations and the sensibilities of the masthead, CJR argued. \u201cI don\u2019t believe our role is to be the leaders of the opposition party,\u201d Baquet told CJR.",

The measure is among a number of rules reinforced by the authorities in early June, including a ban on \u201cmessy eating\u201d by monuments, wandering around bare-chested, jumping into fountains, and dragging wheeled suitcases and pushchairs down historic staircases. \u201cProtecting a monument is fine, and obviously you shouldn\u2019t eat on the steps, but the ban on sitting down is really excessive,\u201d Vittorio Sgarbi, a controversial art critic and former deputy minister of culture, told AdnKronos news agency. \u201cIt seems to me to be a fascist-style provision that the municipality will be forced to review.\u201d \u201cWe agree that people shouldn\u2019t \u2018camp out\u2019 and eat on the steps of monuments, as rubbish gets left behind,\u201d said Tommaso Tanzilli, a director at the Rome unit of Federalberghi, the Italian hotels association. \u201cBut criminalising people for sitting down, especially if they are elderly, is a little exaggerated.\u201d Claudio Pica, president of Fiepet-Confesercenti, in Rome, said the rule was absurd and would drive tourists away. The monument, designed by the architect Francesco de Sanctis between 1723 and 1726, underwent a \u20ac1.5m restoration in 2016, funded by the luxury jeweller Bulgari. Similar measures are in place in Venice, with stewards patrolling the steps of the porticos that surround St Mark\u2019s Square and other monuments throughout the summer. The exercise of moving people away is often futile, as unwitting visitors soon replace them. But authorities there do take tough action against those who flout the \u201cdecorum\u201d rules: in July, two German tourists were fined \u20ac950 and asked to leave the city after being caught preparing themselves coffee on a camping stove on the steps of the Rialto Bridge. And the rich and famous are not excluded from Italy\u2019s rules. The newlywed German model Heidi Klum and her husband are reportedly facing a \u20ac6,000 fine for swimming in Capri\u2019s Blue Grotto. The couple, who married on the island on Saturday, allegedly dived into the turquoise waters of the cavern from a yacht shortly before sunset on Monday. People can visit the grotto by boat, but swimming is strictly forbidden. Ten ways to get in trouble in Italy As Rome and other Italian cities continue their crackdown on \u201cuncouth\u201d behaviour, you might get in trouble if you do any of the following: \u201cMessy eating\u201d or \u201ccamping out\u201d on piazzas or the steps of monuments. Singing, while drunk, on public transport. Wrapping your mouth around the nozzle of a drinking fountain. Walking around bare-chested. Dragging wheeled suitcases and buggies down historic staircases. Jumping into fountains. Dipping your toes into a canal in Venice. Feeding pigeons in Venice. Building sandcastles in Eraclea, a beach town near Venice. Wearing noisy shoes in Capri (wooden clogs have been banned since 1960).",

      "bodyText": "Lawyers for Aaron Campbell, the teenager convicted of the brutal rape and murder of six-year-old schoolgirl Alesha MacPhail, have argued that his sentencing last March to a minimum term of 27 years was \u201cexcessive and amounted to a miscarriage of justice\u201d. Defence QC Brian McConnachie, who represented Campbell during his trial in February, told three appeal court judges in Edinburgh on Wednesday morning that the killing of the schoolgirl on the Isle of Bute last July was \u201can appalling and heinous crime\u201d. He insisted that the outcome of the appeal would not determine \u201cwhen or indeed if the appellant is ever released\u201d. That would be a matter for the parole board, said McConnachie, and the appellant accepted that day might never come. Campbell \u2013 who was 16 at the time of the murder \u2013 watched the proceedings via video link from Polmont young offender institution. He could be seen by the court, wearing a black polo shirt and listening attentively as McConnachie put his arguments forward. McConnachie argued that the trial judge, Lord Matthews, had attached too great importance to two sentencing reports which were unduly pessimistic regarding Campbell\u2019s capacity for rehabilitation, and thus imposed an excessive punishment of 27 years to his life sentence. Lady Dorrian, Scotland\u2019s second most senior judge, told McConnachie that the case law indicated that in sentencing children, factors that may not apply to adults should be taken into account, such as their immaturity and whether personality traits in juveniles were more transitory and capable of rehabilitation. But she went on to point out that the sentencing reports on Campbell\u2019s case suggested he had an \u201cextremely limited capacity\u201d for change. McConnachie argued: \u201cThe reports are incredibly negative and pessimistic but they are a snapshot in time of the person we have today. \u201cBut to wait until he is 43 years of age is an extraordinarily lengthy period of time which does not allow for the process of maturation, development of responsibility or healthy adult personality.\u201d Adjourning the court, Dorrian said that the matter \u201crequires proper consideration and time\u201d. In a statement released in advance of the hearing, Alesha\u2019s mother, Georgina Lochrane, said: \u201cWe do not have any insight as to what the outcome will be on Wednesday and what will take place other than our prayers and hopes that our justice system does not fail Alesha.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Tucker Carlson, the Fox News host who regularly echoes Donald Trump\u2019s anti-immigrant \u201cinvasion\u201d rhetoric, has described white supremacy in America as a \u201choax\u201d and a \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d. Coming just days after a Texas man allegedly killed 22 people in El Paso after posting a manifesto complaining of a \u201cHispanic invasion\u201d, the prime-time news star defended the president from criticisms of his rhetoric by disputing that Trump ever \u201cendorsed white supremacy or came close to endorsing white supremacy\u201d. \u201cIf you were to assemble a list, a hierarchy of concerns, problems this country has, where would white supremacy be on the list? Right up there with Russia probably. It\u2019s actually not a real problem in America,\u201d Carlson told his audience on Tuesday night. Claiming that the white supremacy issue was being used by Democrats as a political tool, Carlson continued: \u201cThis is a hoax. Just like the Russia hoax, it\u2019s a conspiracy theory used to divide the country and keep a hold on power.\u201d Carlson also claimed all the white supremacists in America could fit inside a football stadium before repeating his belief that white supremacy in the US is a non-existent problem. He went on to insist that he\u2019s \u201cnever met anybody \u2013 not one person \u2013 who ascribes to white supremacy\u201d. The host\u2019s comments were made even as the FBI stated last month that it considers a majority of the growing number of domestic terrorism cases as versions of white supremacist violence. The suspect in the Walmart shooting on Saturday that left 22 people dead and injured dozens more posted an anti-immigrant manifesto minutes before the rampage highlighting his support for a gunman in Christchurch, New Zealand, who killed 51 people at two mosques in March. According to FBI data, since 2011 suspects with ties to white extremism have carried out at least 17 \u201cactive-shooter\u201d attacks, or attacks defined by the agency as \u201can individual actively engaged in killing or attempting to kill people in a populated area\u201d. After the mass shooting at a food festival in Gilroy, California, last month, the FBI confirmed it considered that attack to be a potential case of domestic terrorism. The gunman in that incident, 19-year-old Santino Legan, had been exploring violent ideologies and had drawn up a list of potential religious and political targets. A study by the New York Times published this week indicated the growing international ideological connections between attackers as well as repeated referencing by later gunman to previous incidents. In keeping with the attackers in Christchurch and El Paso, the gunmen in Poway, California, and Pittsburgh, Pennslyvania, posted white nationalist views online before launching their assaults. Both the El Paso and Poway gunmen praised the Christchurch shooter in manifestos posted online. While the extent to which online message boards such as 8chan are used as a conduit for violent ideologies, the role of the mainstream media remains clouded. Carlson is not alone at his channel in attempting to minimize the role of white supremacy ideology in the current wave of attacks. The media publication Media Matters this week accused Fox News of attempting to \u201cmainstream\u201d the white supremacist conspiracy theory of \u201creplacement\u201d. \u201cAdding to its pattern of mainstreaming toxic extremism, Fox News regularly echoes and sanitizes the dangerous white supremacist conspiracy theory that non-white immigrants represent the threat of \u2018replacement\u2019 to white populations,\u201d the publication wrote. \u201cThis racist talking point has already inspired massacres and hate crimes around the world.\u201d",

      "body": "<h2>Lou Adler, promoter and producer</h2> <p>In 1967, there was a meeting at Mama Cass\u2019s house that included Paul McCartney. The general conversation was: \u201cWhy isn\u2019t rock\u2019n\u2019roll considered an art form in the way that jazz and folk are?\u201d A few weeks later, the promoters Alan Pariser and Ben Shapiro got in touch to book the Mamas and the Papas for one night at Monterey County Fairgrounds in California. We said we\u2019d think about it. About three o\u2019clock in the morning, I got a call from John Phillips of the Mamas and the Papas. He said: \u201cWhy don\u2019t we do a festival, add more days, and get the acts to play for nothing?\u201d This was a chance to elevate how rock\u2019n\u2019roll was thought of.</p> <p>We had six weeks. Chip Monck had to build the stage, put in all the lights and sound, and get 35 acts on and off. That had never happened before. We wanted to show all the genres of rock\u2019n\u2019roll: the blues people, the San Francisco groups, the bands from England. We wanted the Stones but they couldn\u2019t get into the US. The Beach Boys backed out. We tried for all the Motown acts but I don\u2019t know if [label founder] Berry Gordy understood what we were doing. You had to really buy into it if your acts weren\u2019t going to get paid.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4d6df3bc701c7bb841adf0bec0c6e1c12c41c322\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d6df3bc701c7bb841adf0bec0c6e1c12c41c322/0_0_3600_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Not on my network\u2019 \u2026 Hendrix on stage at the festival in June 1967.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Not on my network\u2019 \u2026 Hendrix on stage at the festival in June 1967.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was pretty phenomenal. Otis Redding was beyond anything I had ever seen. That was the largest white crowd he had ever performed for. And Hendrix, of course. A couple of girls in the movie of the festival look as if they could be watching a horror film \u2013 they don\u2019t know <em>what</em> they\u2019re seeing.</p> <p>It was maybe the last time you would see so many performers in the audience. Most of these acts had heard about the other bperformers but had never seen them so they were as curious as anybody. Look at Mama Cass\u2019s face during Janis Joplin. They were fans. Woodstock was about the weather and the number of people \u2013 Monterey was about the music. That\u2019s the difference.</p> <p>John and I made a deal with ABC to do a movie for TV. We asked DA Pennebaker because of [his Bob Dylan tour documentary] Don\u2019t Look Back. He really understood the music and the personalities. Once we looked at the footage, Pennebaker said: \u201cThis is not a television show. This is a movie.\u201d We went to see Tom Moore, head of ABC and a very conservative southern gentleman, and showed him Hendrix [humping] his amp. He said: \u201cNot on my network.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"4cb69ab3f2ff420eb4533db8d63c937c79f90964\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4cb69ab3f2ff420eb4533db8d63c937c79f90964/0_0_3710_2460/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Woodstock was about the weather and the number of people \u2013 Monterey was about the music\u2019 \u2026 Cass Elliot of The Mamas and the Papas in the audience.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"663\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Woodstock was about the weather and the number of people \u2013 Monterey was about the music\u2019 \u2026 Cass Elliot of The Mamas and the Papas in the audience.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But we knew exactly what we were doing. With the advent of FM radio, Rolling Stone magazine and the festival, rock\u2019n\u2019roll was truly elevated. Promoters realised they could do festivals, which eventually led to Coachella. It\u2019s unfortunate how many people who performed at Monterey are no longer with us, but they\u2019re with us because of Pennebaker. I\u2019d say we wouldn\u2019t be talking about Monterey today without the movie. I play it at universities and when Hendrix and Otis and Joplin finish, I hear applause. These people are <em>there</em>.</p> <p><strong>DA Pennebaker, film director</strong></p> <p>John Phillips asked me if I\u2019d be interested in doing a film of a music festival in California. I was still under the influence of The Endless Summer, Bruce Brown\u2019s film about surfers. California was where everyone wanted to go when they graduated from school or college. Generally, people from Los Angeles and people from San Francisco had conflicting musical tastes and were sort of antagonistic. Monterey was a way of joining California where it hadn\u2019t been joined before. What made it successful was the decision to throw the big-money ideas out of the window. People really came to play and hear each other play. They weren\u2019t there to make a lot of money.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNrygTqx0FA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xNrygTqx0FA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNrygTqx0FA\">Watch a trailer for Monterey Pop</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>I made Don\u2019t Look Back by myself but Monterey Pop was made by the people who worked with me, such as Albert Maysles. I didn\u2019t direct it really. I edited it and made a storyline out of it but they all saw it differently and filmed it how they saw it. They were all people who had come to work with us to find out how to make these kind of films. They were not made the way commercial films were. You went out and found something or somebody and you filmed it the way you wanted. They were learning right there in front of me.</p> <p>We only had a limited amount of film so we thought we\u2019d have to decide on a particular song for each group, but in fact people shot anything that interested them. So we had to go down to Los Angeles twice to get more stock. I hesitated to say: \u201cDon\u2019t do it.\u201d The music was so incredible: I wanted to shoot everything that happened. I liked the idea of watching music expand its possibilities as it went along. The movie started off with Canned Heat doing a simple country song, and ended with Ravi Shankar playing really complicated music.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"61bcc0fe0f972b0481d16552d38d6400ff0b5d9d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/61bcc0fe0f972b0481d16552d38d6400ff0b5d9d/0_0_2459_3073/800.jpg\" alt=\"Out of film again \u2026 DA Pennebaker in action.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Out of film again \u2026 DA Pennebaker in action.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Music was moving so fast and nobody understood what was coming next.

My housemate very carefully dusts the leaves of his, while gently murmuring and singing. One day, a thousand economies from now, he will make a handsome, loving father to an actual child with feet. All of this \u2013 death, life, landlords, millennials, cacti \u2013 is why I struggle to raise my usual level of contempt for the Patch Plant Hotel, a new PR stunt-cum-actually-good-idea from online plant-ordering behemoth Patch. The deal is this: much like you would put a dog in a kennel when you go on holiday, you put your beloved plants into the plant hotel, where someone with some little pruning scissors will look after it until you\u2019re back. You could just ask your neighbours, yes, but who really talks to those? You could ask your friends, but who really trusts them? Beyond the ludicrousness of collecting all your plants up and getting in a cab with them down to Battersea \u2013 an absurd thing to do \u2013 all of this strikes me as a frankly brilliant idea. In 10 years\u2019 time, when the birth rate is at an all-time low but everyone has a thriving yukka, these things will be all the rage. And when they are, I will be checking all my cacti in and leaving them there permanently. It\u2019s for their own good.",

      "bodyText": "The son of Congo-Brazzaville\u2019s president has misappropriated $50m (\u00a341m) of public money by routing it through shell companies and secrecy jurisdictions, according to a new investigation. Six countries in the EU, the US state of Delaware and the British Virgin Islands all played a key role in Denis Christel Sassou-Nguesso\u2019s scheme, according to Global Witness. The campaign group said the money was siphoned off through an apparent sham contract Congo-Brazzaville had with a Brazilian infrastructure company. The money-laundering scheme said to have been used by Sassou-Nguesso, an MP as well as the son and namesake of the man who has spent 35 years as president, is similar to the one his sister Claudia allegedly used to steal $20m of state funds, part of which she used to buy a luxury apartment in Trump Tower in New York, allegations she has denied. Investigators obtained documents that they said showed $675m left Congo-Brazzaville\u2019s treasury, and that sums totalling more than $50m subsequently went through companies in Delaware and the British Virgin Islands before reaching Cyprus. Cypriot companies secretly owned by Sassou-Nguesso received the money, Global Witness said, and he used it to make payments to companies based in Poland, Portugal, Spain and Switzerland. The alleged embezzlement dates from 2013 and 2014. \u201cAs we followed the trail of money we found that it was funnelled through several jurisdictions which pride themselves on having strong anti-money laundering regimes, such as the EU and the US,\u201d said Mariana Abreu, who led the investigation. The global financial system is supposed to prevent kleptocrats from robbing their citizens, but there are significant loopholes. An estimated $90bn is laundered through the UK every year. Congo-Brazzaville has large oil reserves, but almost half of its people live in poverty. A Portuguese businessman who is already under investigation for corruption, Jos\u00e9 Veiga, allegedly facilitated part of the money-laundering, by helping secure public works contracts in Congo-Brazzaville for the Brazilian company Asperbras. According to Global Witness, Asperbras was contracted to carry out a geological survey, and subcontracted part of the work to a Cypriot company called Gabox Limited, despite the fact that Gabox had been set up just two days before the deal was signed, and had no employees or capital. Gabox was to receive 25% of what Asperbras got from the Congolese government \u2013 $50m of the $200m that the Swiss NGO Public Eye said the project was worth. In a written response to the Guardian, Asperbras rejected any claim of overpriced contracts and irregularities in Congo-Brazzaville\u2019s public procurement process. \u201cAll public work contracts concluded by Asperbras with various and different ministries have been legally approved and scrupulously comply with all procedures provided for in Republic of Congo\u2019s law,\u201d the response said. Veiga, who is a former director of Benfica football club and was reportedly known as the \u201cPortuguese wizard\u201d of the Congolese president, was briefly arrested in 2016 as part of an investigation, still ongoing, into money laundering and international corruption. He was released after three months in jail and a further two under house arrest. IN 2017, responding to the Public Eye investigation, Veiga denied all the allegations against him, saying everything he had done was legal. Documents obtained by Global Witness allegedly show that in November 2013 a department responsible for managing Congo-Brazzaville\u2019s treasury transferred roughly $675m to a Delaware-based Asperbras subsidiary called Asperbras LLC, seemingly for major public works contracts. According to Global Witness, 11 days later, Veiga set up a company in Cyprus called Gabox Ltd. Two days later, said Global Witness, this company signed a contract with Energy &amp; Mining, an Asperbras LLC subsidiary based in the British Virgin Islands, ostensibly to carry out part of a geological mapping project in Congo-Brazzaville. Various Asperbras accounts at the now defunct Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo (BES) channeled funds to Energy &amp; Mining\u2019s BES bank account in Cape Verde, the campaign group said, and these were then disbursed to companies fronted by Veiga in Cyprus and Congo. Corporate documents obtained in Cyprus and notarised contracts from Congo-Brazzaville show that Sassou-Nguesso was the real owner of the Cypriot companies, Global Witness allege, and that the companies he owned received about $50.5m. The campaign group claims other documents showed that Veiga was a frontman for Sassou-Nguesso in a Spanish and an Estonian shell company as well. Global Witness, which has long campaigned for public registers of beneficial ownership in jurisdictions where it is difficult to ascertain who really owns companies, said the investigation showed that there were major gaps in the implementation of anti-corruption measures in European countries. \u201cAll of the jurisdictions involved urgently need to address the ways in which shell companies can move funds around at ease, facing no tough questions on provenance or legitimacy despite multiple corruption warning signs,\u201d said Abreu.",

As the end of the slave trade loomed and South Carolinians binge-imported black bodies, so many Africans died there that they were thrown into the water, their floating corpses markers of a mass grave.

The novel I read then was her first, The Bluest Eye, the story of a young girl who believes in the ugliness of her blackness and poverty. It was also the first that altered my own journey.

Morrison captured the trauma of slavery and racism so powerfully that my sense of the world \u2013 the world of a mixed-race, British-Ghanaian girl, a story so different from those told in her books \u2013 became forever infused with her narration of the African American experience.

She made the pain and power of her ancestors such a deep aspect of my own consciousness, and \u2013 as Hilton Als so powerfully put it \u2013 she broke our hearts with the truth.

There will always be one more thing.\u201d When terror struck her city on 11 September 2001, Morrison spoke directly to the dead. \u201cI have nothing to give \u2026 except this gesture, this thread thrown between your humanity and mine,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI want to hold you in my arms and as your soul got shot of its box of flesh to understand, as you have done, the wit of eternity: its gift of unhinged release tearing through the darkness of its knell.\u201d Morrison was not afraid to write of death, of spirits, ghosts, ancestors, destiny and magic. She did more than any other writer to show the pain of her people to the world \u2013 a suffering that echoes down the ages \u2013 while cautioning powerfully about the distraction of racism. She revealed the sins of her nation, while profoundly elevating its canon. She suffused the telling of blackness with beauty, while steering us away from the perils of the white gaze. That\u2019s why she told her stories. And why we will never, ever stop reading them. \u2022 Afua Hirsch is a Guardian columnist",

The move comes after the annual event, the Chinese-speaking world\u2019s version of the Oscars, became a lightning rod for questions about Taiwanese independence last year, sparking a debate between Taiwanese and mainland stars as well as the online community. Ties between Beijing and Taipei have since become more tense, with China announcing last week it would stop issuing individual travel permits for Taiwan to Chinese travellers, dealing a blow to Taiwan\u2019s tourism industry. \u201cWe certainly would regret if it was true,\u201d Taipei Golden Horse film festival said in a statement.

It\u2019s a useful distraction. Yes, as the Bahrain rows have shown, a lot of politicians will be much happier fielding questions over whether British drivers should boycott a potential Saudi race than questions over why their administration continues to enable arguably the most gruesome regime on earth. All told the Saudi Grand Prix feels quite the inevitability in the not-to-distant future, when it will be absolutely in line with the \u201cbrand values\u201d of the UK to concede the foreign policy brief to Lewis Hamilton.",

The \u201cBasic Law\u201d constitution guarantees to protect, for the next 50 years, the democratic institutions that make&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong&nbsp;distinct from Communist-ruled mainland China.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2003:&nbsp;</b>Hong&nbsp;Kong\u2019s leaders introduce legislation that would forbid acts of treason and subversion against the Chinese government. The bill resembles laws used to charge dissidents on the mainland. An estimated half a million people turn out to protest against the bill. As a result of the backlash, further action on the proposal is halted.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2007:&nbsp;</b>The Basic Law stated that the ultimate aim was for&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong\u2019s voters to achieve a complete democracy, but China decides in 2007 that universal suffrage in elections for the chief executive cannot be implemented until 2017. Some lawmakers are chosen by business and trade groups, while others are elected by vote. In a bid to accelerate a decision on universal suffrage, five lawmakers resign. But this act is followed by the adoption of the Beijing-backed electoral changes, which expand the chief executive\u2019s selection committee and add more seats for lawmakers elected by direct vote. The legislation divides Hong&nbsp;Kong's pro-democracy camp, as some support the reforms while others say they will only delay full democracy while reinforcing a structure that favors Beijing.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2014:&nbsp;</b>The Chinese government introduces a bill allowing Hong&nbsp;Kong&nbsp;residents to vote for their leader in 2017, but with one major caveat: the candidates must be approved by Beijing. Pro-democracy lawmakers are incensed by the bill, which they call an example of \u201cfake universal suffrage\u201d and \u201cfake democracy\u201d. The move triggers a massive protest as crowds occupy some of&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong\u2019s most crowded districts for 70 days. In June 2015,&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong&nbsp;legislators formally reject the bill, and electoral reform stalls. The current chief executive, Carrie Lam, widely seen as the Chinese Communist party\u2019s favoured candidate, is hand-picked in 2017 by a 1,200-person committee dominated by pro-Beijing elites.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2019:&nbsp;</b>Lam pushes amendments to extradition laws that would allow people to be sent to mainland China to face charges. The proposed legislation triggers a huge protest, with organisers putting the turnout at 1 million, and a standoff that forces the legislature to postpone debate on the bills. After weeks of protest, often meeting with violent reprisals from the Hong Kong police, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/04/hong-kong-lam-to-withdraw-extradition-bill-say-reports\">Lam announced that she would withdraw the bill</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The protests began in opposition to a now-suspended extradition law, which would have allowed suspects to be tried in mainland Chinese courts.

      "bodyText": "The UN\u2019s investigator into global poverty has said innocent people are being caught up in the mass surveillance system used by the UK\u2019s welfare state to combat benefit fraud. His warning comes as disabled rights activists in the north-west claim that demonstrators with disabilities protesting against austerity cuts are having their personal information passed by police to the Department for Work and Pensions. Both warnings came before a conference in Belfast on Wednesday on the use of surveillance powers and its impact on social security recipients and asylum seekers. Philip Alston, the UN\u2019s special rapporteur on extreme poverty, described it as a tragedy that people imagined that \u201cthe ever-more intrusive surveillance system by the UK welfare state\u201d was used only against alleged welfare cheats. \u201cIt\u2019s not. It will soon affect everyone and leave the society much worse off. Everyone needs to pay attention and insist on decent limits,\u201d he said. Alston said the UK\u2019s surveillance system stood the presumption of innocence on its head. He said this was because everyone applying for a benefit was \u201cscreened for potential wrongdoing in a system of total surveillance\u201d. Among those to complain that they have been caught up unfairly in the state\u2019s use of CCTV cameras \u2013 including footage owned by supermarket chains, access to personal bank statements and conversations on social media \u2013 are disabled rights campaigners in Manchester. Rick Burgess, an activist with Manchester Disabled People Against Cuts, said fears that footage of his members and supporters demonstrating was being passed from police to the DWP had had a \u201cchilling effect\u201d on people\u2019s willingness to protest. \u201cThere are people who are not protesting today because they are terrified by what the DWP might know about them,\u201d he said. \u201cThe idea that information the police gather at protests about some of those taking part could be passed to the DWP for welfare fraud investigations is Stasi-like.\u201d The climate of fear that Burgess and his colleagues describe has been heightened after investigations by the Disability News Service website. An article on the site alleged that Greater Manchester police (GMP) had an agreement with the DWP over shared information. \ufeffA spokesperson for the DWP insisted there was \u201cno formal agreement with the police for this scenario\u201d. \u201cThe department does not request referrals from the police and there is no obligation on either the police or members of the public to provide referrals. In the event we receive information from the police, we consider it on its merits,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cAs is the case with any responsible government department, we stand ready to assist the police in the event they request information from us for the purpose of crime prevention or detection. This service is provided under the Data Protection Act for the purposes of preventing and detecting crime.\u201d GMP, however, confirmed that \u201cinformation is shared between agencies under section 29 of the Data Protection Act\u201d. A spokesperson said: \u201cThis is not specific to protests at all. Information is shared with other agencies as part of wider information sharing for the prevention and investigation of crime, of which it is officers\u2019 lawful duty to do so.\u201d The issue of surveillance powers by the welfare state was raised at a conference organised by the Right to Work, Right to Welfare campaign, which is being held in West Belfast as part of the F\u00e9ile an Phobail festival in the city.",

This would satisfy our \u201cconstitutional requirements\u201d specified by the European court when it granted the UK the unilateral right to revoke. It could also be done without government support, as with Yvette Cooper\u2019s bill in April to force an extension. That passed in three days, while this bill would have more than six weeks. For Tories, in particular, this would carry the advantage of not directly forcing them to bring down their own government. Moderate Conservatives did not sign up to Brexit at any cost and owe Johnson no personal loyalty, while leave-sympathetic Labour MPs such as Lisa Nandy have signalled they would also back such a move. Even if there was no time to clear the bill before 31 October, the EU might take note of the clearly expressed will of parliament to remain. Certainly there would be a question of democratic legitimacy. Brexit was enacted by a referendum and should be ended by one too. Parliament could therefore legislate for a subsequent confirmatory plebiscite to establish whether people in fact want to stay in, or otherwise restart the process. MPs could conceivably (though at great risk) put no deal on the ballot paper for the first time. Revocation is the only option now because there is no time for a referendum before we crash out. The Britain of 2019 is unrecognisable from the country of four years ago. A Brexit that in 2015 meant a Norway-style single market has come to entail our total rupture with every EU instrument, body and law, at any political, economic and human cost. Since the referendum, the Brexiters have refused all compromise. The hardline fringes have hijacked a slim mandate and reinterpreted it in the most extreme way available to them. No deal is the all-or-nothing corruption of a democratic vote, and revocation is its democratic answer. Like every other outcome, it will provoke a sustained political crisis. But in the end it may be the only way to save the economy \u2013 and people\u2019s lives. \u2022 Jonathan Lis is deputy director of the thinktank British Influence",

There are still imperfections, of course, but fans have not felt like this for some time; there is a hum of synthesised, whirring excitement at how Hasenh\u00fcttl could fare in his first full season in charge, given how he not only transformed a seemingly doomed side inside six months but reinvigorated a whole club, an entire city.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/22/southampton-continue-to-invest-in-youth-after-gao-jishengs-boardroom-reshuffle\">Southampton continue to invest in youth after Gao Jisheng\u2019s reshuffle</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The off-season has not passed without incident, though, with Hasenh\u00fcttl\u2019s assistant, Danny Rohl, departing at the end of last month and a boardroom reshuffle leading to the majority owner, Jisheng Gao, replacing the departed Ralph Krueger as chairman, with the chief executive, Martin Semmens, and the director of football, Ross Wilson, who has been promoted to the club\u2019s board, assuming more responsibility following Krueger\u2019s exit after six years.</p> \n<p>The board have successfully freshened up a stale squad with two new arrivals: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/17/che-adams-interview-southampton-non-league-thurnby-lodge\">Che Adams, a powerful striker</a>, and Moussa Djenepo, a raw winger whom should restore an element of unpredictability to this side, for a combined total of almost \u00a330m. Danny Ings has also signed permanently from Liverpool on a four-year contract for \u00a319m. But their work is not done: the squad remains lopsided, with Fraser Forster, Guido Carrillo, Mario Lemina and Charlie Austin among the dispensable high-earners still on the books.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/17/che-adams-interview-southampton-non-league-thurnby-lodge\">Che Adams: \u2018In non-league it\u2019s just a question of how hard you\u2019re going to get kicked\u2019</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Southampton\u2019s squad is in a funny place, whereby they have five senior centre-backs but ostensibly require at least one more, with the occasionally erratic Maya Yoshida, the club\u2019s longest-serving player after James Ward-Prowse, the most trusty these days. A bloated squad does not necessarily translate to every base being covered either; the spine of the side is unconvincing and they appear light in wide areas. The exciting bit for a club with a rich history of leaning on its academy is that they have a manager happy to scratch beneath the surface.</p> \n<p>There is another wave of talent determined to burst into the first team in the same way Yan Valery did so impressively last season. Callum Slattery, who has been capped by England at youth level, has caught Hasenh\u00fcttl\u2019s eye in pre-season, as have the teenagers Will Smallbone and Jake Vokins, who will provide competition for Ryan Bertrand at left-back following Matt Targett\u2019s departure.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/07/southampton-zip/giv-3902hCGxrb0W3VgU\" data-alt=\"Last five\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/07/southampton-zip/giv-3902hCGxrb0W3VgU\">Last five</a> \n</figure> \n<p>When family and friends come over to his city-centre apartment to celebrate a victory, Hasenh\u00fcttl occasionally treats them to a rendition of Queen or Elton John on the piano and the former RB Leipzig coach quickly won over supporters too. Free drinks vouchers, overzealous touchline celebrations, a supercharged style and sitcom sound bites \u2013 \u201cIf you want a guarantee, buy a washing machine\u201d \u2013 endeared himself to fans but he did not only talk the talk. After watching Southampton <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/dec/05/tottenham-southampton-premier-league-match-report\">wilt against Tottenham</a> at Wembley, the size of the task facing him was clear. By the time Southampton <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/dec/08/cardiff-city-southampton-premier-league-match-report\">lost at Cardiff in his first match</a> \u2013 Hasenh\u00fcttl had to wait 90 minutes for the so-called new manager bounce to kick in \u2013 they were 19<sup>th</sup> with nine points from 16 games.</p> \n<p>They finished five points clear of the drop but there are issues to address: no player has reached double figures in the Premier League since Sadio Man\u00e9 three years ago, while home form, particularly against teams they are expected to give a run for their money, remains a concern (Southampton have won only 15 of their past 57 league matches at St Mary\u2019s). The arrival of Adams from Birmingham City represents a major boost. Named after Che Guevara and released by Coventry at 14, the former Birmingham forward has the tools to transfer his goalscoring form into the Premier League, in the same way Callum Wilson prospered along the south coast at Bournemouth.</p> \n<p>Adams enjoyed a promising pre-season, scoring three times, including 116 seconds into his debut, and will likely start alongside Danny Ings. Whether Hasenh\u00fcttl can coax more out of Sofiane Boufal, who has been reintegrated after a loan at Celta Vigo, could help. Hasenh\u00fcttl transformed Nathan Redmond from a scapegoat into the club\u2019s player of the year last season, while Ward-Prowse thrived on regular game-time, earning an England recall in the process.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/07/southampton-zip/giv-3902alHoNh6eciSz\" data-alt=\"WDL\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/07/southampton-zip/giv-3902alHoNh6eciSz\">WDL</a> \n</figure> \n<p>The captain, Pierre-Emile H\u00f8jbjerg, is a classy performer but, as Southampton found out to their detriment last season, there is no time to establish if they have sufficiently bolstered, to discover if they are suitably equipped to avoid another relegation scrap or whether they will sink or swim. \u201cI think it will be more difficult [this season],\u201d Hasenh\u00fcttl said, \u201cbecause we will have four or five months of intensive work to do and then normally you go into the winter break in Germany, but here you come into the most demanding and intensive period. That will be a very big question, how we manage this.\u201d</p> \n<p>The way in which Hasenh\u00fcttl galvanised a dejected group of players was impressive, with St Mary\u2019s transformed from a breeding ground of pessimism into one of positivity. Supporters are hardly giddy with enthusiasm but Hasenh\u00fcttl has generated a palpable degree of confidence around the place, in the same way Mauricio Pochettino and Ronald Koeman did before him. As Mel Morris, the Derby owner, recently said discussing Frank Lampard\u2019s credentials: \u201cTeams fall apart because belief gets shattered, belief disappears, belief that \u2018we can do it\u2019, belief in the manager\u2019s tactics. They are the things that cause you those dips and it is how you bounce back and get the belief reinstated that is the key.\u201d There are no such problems with Hasenh\u00fcttl, who did his coaching badges alongside J\u00fcrgen Klopp.</p> \n<p>It would be easy to say early away trips to Burnley and Brighton could set the tone for the season but home matches against Liverpool and then Manchester United in August may garner a better indication of what lies ahead. It was against those teams that Southampton came alive in Pochettino\u2019s pomp and in Koeman\u2019s reign, when they went marching into such games with bona fide intentions of winning them and with a whiff of invincibility, no matter the opponents in the tunnel.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"68bc874c-c080-4efb-98c1-cd42665645cc\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>No 1:</b>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/29/premier-league-2019-20-preview-arsenal-unai-emery-champions-league-pepe\">Arsenal</a><br><b>No 2:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/29/premier-league-201920-preview-no-2-aston-villa\">Aston Villa</a><br><b>No 3:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/30/premier-league-2019-20-preview-bournemouth-eddie-howe\">Bournemouth</a><br><b>No 4:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/30/premier-league-201920-preview-no-4-brighton\">Brighton</a><br><b>No 5:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/31/premier-league-201920-preview-no-5-burnley\">Burnley</a><br><b>No 6:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/31/premier-league-201920-preview-no-6-chelsea\">Chelsea</a><br><b>No 7:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/01/premier-league-2019-20-preview-crystal-palace-hodgson-zaha\">Crystal Palace</a><br><b>No 8:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/01/premier-league-201920-preview-no-8-everton\">Everton</a><br><b>No 9:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/02/premier-league-2019-20-preview-leicester-brendan-rodgers-perez-tielemans\">Leicester City</a><br><b>No 10:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/02/premier-league-201920-preview-no-10-liverpool\">Liverpool</a><br><b>No 11:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/05/premier-league-201920-preview-no-11-manchester-city\">Manchester City</a><br><b>No 12:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/05/premier-league-201920-preview-no-12-manchester-united\">Manchester United</a><br><b>No 13:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/06/premier-league-201920-preview-no-13-newcastle-united\">Newcastle United</a><br><b>No 14:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/06/premier-league-201920-preview-no-14-norwich-city\">Norwich City</a><br><b>No 15:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/07/premier-league-201920-preview-no-15-sheffield-united\">Sheffield United</a><br><b>No 16:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/07/premier-league-201920-preview-no-16-southampton\">Southampton</a><br><b>No 17:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/08/premier-league-201920-preview-no-17-tottenham\">Tottenham Hotspur</a><br><b>No 18:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/08/premier-league-201920-preview-no-18-watford\">Watford</a><br><b>No 19:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/09/premier-league-201920-preview-no-19-west-ham\">West Ham</a><br><b>No 20:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/09/premier-league-201920-preview-no-20-wolves\">Wolves</a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>That daring mentality has already served Hasenh\u00fcttl well since picking up Southampton by the scruff of the neck in December, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/dec/16/southampton-arsenal-premier-league-match-report\">beating Arsenal</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/mar/09/southampton-tottenham-premier-league-match-report\">then Tottenham</a> at St Mary\u2019s.

      "bodyText": "Guardian writers\u2019 predicted position: 13th (NB: this is not necessarily Ben Fisher\u2019s prediction but the average of our writers\u2019 tips) Last season\u2019s position: 16th Odds to win the league (via Oddschecker): 1,000-1 As well as Bohemian Rhapsody, one of Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl\u2019s go-to ditties on his Bluthner grand piano is Depeche Mode\u2019s Enjoy the Silence and the relative calm surrounding Southampton this summer is music to the ears of supporters left drained by successive staccato seasons. There are still imperfections, of course, but fans have not felt like this for some time; there is a hum of synthesised, whirring excitement at how Hasenh\u00fcttl could fare in his first full season in charge, given how he not only transformed a seemingly doomed side inside six months but reinvigorated a whole club, an entire city. The off-season has not passed without incident, though, with Hasenh\u00fcttl\u2019s assistant, Danny Rohl, departing at the end of last month and a boardroom reshuffle leading to the majority owner, Jisheng Gao, replacing the departed Ralph Krueger as chairman, with the chief executive, Martin Semmens, and the director of football, Ross Wilson, who has been promoted to the club\u2019s board, assuming more responsibility following Krueger\u2019s exit after six years. The board have successfully freshened up a stale squad with two new arrivals: Che Adams, a powerful striker, and Moussa Djenepo, a raw winger whom should restore an element of unpredictability to this side, for a combined total of almost \u00a330m. Danny Ings has also signed permanently from Liverpool on a four-year contract for \u00a319m. But their work is not done: the squad remains lopsided, with Fraser Forster, Guido Carrillo, Mario Lemina and Charlie Austin among the dispensable high-earners still on the books. Southampton\u2019s squad is in a funny place, whereby they have five senior centre-backs but ostensibly require at least one more, with the occasionally erratic Maya Yoshida, the club\u2019s longest-serving player after James Ward-Prowse, the most trusty these days. A bloated squad does not necessarily translate to every base being covered either; the spine of the side is unconvincing and they appear light in wide areas. The exciting bit for a club with a rich history of leaning on its academy is that they have a manager happy to scratch beneath the surface. There is another wave of talent determined to burst into the first team in the same way Yan Valery did so impressively last season. Callum Slattery, who has been capped by England at youth level, has caught Hasenh\u00fcttl\u2019s eye in pre-season, as have the teenagers Will Smallbone and Jake Vokins, who will provide competition for Ryan Bertrand at left-back following Matt Targett\u2019s departure. When family and friends come over to his city-centre apartment to celebrate a victory, Hasenh\u00fcttl occasionally treats them to a rendition of Queen or Elton John on the piano and the former RB Leipzig coach quickly won over supporters too. Free drinks vouchers, overzealous touchline celebrations, a supercharged style and sitcom sound bites \u2013 \u201cIf you want a guarantee, buy a washing machine\u201d \u2013 endeared himself to fans but he did not only talk the talk. After watching Southampton wilt against Tottenham at Wembley, the size of the task facing him was clear. By the time Southampton lost at Cardiff in his first match \u2013 Hasenh\u00fcttl had to wait 90 minutes for the so-called new manager bounce to kick in \u2013 they were 19th with nine points from 16 games. They finished five points clear of the drop but there are issues to address: no player has reached double figures in the Premier League since Sadio Man\u00e9 three years ago, while home form, particularly against teams they are expected to give a run for their money, remains a concern (Southampton have won only 15 of their past 57 league matches at St Mary\u2019s). The arrival of Adams from Birmingham City represents a major boost. Named after Che Guevara and released by Coventry at 14, the former Birmingham forward has the tools to transfer his goalscoring form into the Premier League, in the same way Callum Wilson prospered along the south coast at Bournemouth. Adams enjoyed a promising pre-season, scoring three times, including 116 seconds into his debut, and will likely start alongside Danny Ings. Whether Hasenh\u00fcttl can coax more out of Sofiane Boufal, who has been reintegrated after a loan at Celta Vigo, could help. Hasenh\u00fcttl transformed Nathan Redmond from a scapegoat into the club\u2019s player of the year last season, while Ward-Prowse thrived on regular game-time, earning an England recall in the process. The captain, Pierre-Emile H\u00f8jbjerg, is a classy performer but, as Southampton found out to their detriment last season, there is no time to establish if they have sufficiently bolstered, to discover if they are suitably equipped to avoid another relegation scrap or whether they will sink or swim. \u201cI think it will be more difficult [this season],\u201d Hasenh\u00fcttl said, \u201cbecause we will have four or five months of intensive work to do and then normally you go into the winter break in Germany, but here you come into the most demanding and intensive period. That will be a very big question, how we manage this.\u201d The way in which Hasenh\u00fcttl galvanised a dejected group of players was impressive, with St Mary\u2019s transformed from a breeding ground of pessimism into one of positivity. Supporters are hardly giddy with enthusiasm but Hasenh\u00fcttl has generated a palpable degree of confidence around the place, in the same way Mauricio Pochettino and Ronald Koeman did before him. As Mel Morris, the Derby owner, recently said discussing Frank Lampard\u2019s credentials: \u201cTeams fall apart because belief gets shattered, belief disappears, belief that \u2018we can do it\u2019, belief in the manager\u2019s tactics. They are the things that cause you those dips and it is how you bounce back and get the belief reinstated that is the key.\u201d There are no such problems with Hasenh\u00fcttl, who did his coaching badges alongside J\u00fcrgen Klopp. It would be easy to say early away trips to Burnley and Brighton could set the tone for the season but home matches against Liverpool and then Manchester United in August may garner a better indication of what lies ahead. It was against those teams that Southampton came alive in Pochettino\u2019s pomp and in Koeman\u2019s reign, when they went marching into such games with bona fide intentions of winning them and with a whiff of invincibility, no matter the opponents in the tunnel. That daring mentality has already served Hasenh\u00fcttl well since picking up Southampton by the scruff of the neck in December, beating Arsenal and then Tottenham at St Mary\u2019s. But this season, Hasenh\u00fcttl knows, will be a different endurance test.",

However, the ways that people live have been changing,\u201d said Sophie Sanders, of the population statistics division at the ONS.</p> <p>\u201cWhile married couple families remain the most common, cohabiting couples are the fastest-growing family type as people increasingly choose to live together before or without getting married.\u201d</p> <p>The research also found that the number of same-sex couple families had grown by more than 50% since 2015, and the number of same-sex married couple families had risen more than fourfold.</p> <p>The number of same-sex married couple families has doubled to 68,000 since 2017, representing 29.4% of all same-sex couple families in 2018, compared with 8.9% in 2015. Same-sex marriage was introduced in March 2014.</p> <p>\u201cThe trends for opposite-sex and same-sex couple families are going in opposite directions,\u201d said Saunders. \u201cThe share of opposite-sex married couple families is decreasing, while opposite-sex cohabiting couple families are increasing, although at a much slower rate of change than for same-sex couple families.\u201d</p> <p>More than two-thirds of families are married with children, but their proportion has declined from 69.1% of all families in 2008 to 67.1% in 2018.</p> <p>The proportion of cohabiting couple families, the second largest family type, has increased from 15.3% to 17.9%, equating to 3.4 million. The number of lone parent families stands at 2.9 million (15% of the total), making them the third-largest group.</p> <p>The data also reveals a significant increase in the number of people living alone, exceeding 8 million for the first time. The data suggests this increase has been driven by rises in women aged 45 to 64 and men aged 65 to 74 years living on their own. The number aged 65 and over and living alone increased by 500,000 or 14.8% between 2008 and 2018, to 3.9 million.</p> <p>\u201cReasons for increases in these age and sex groups include an increasing population aged 45 to 64 years, rises in the proportions who are divorced or never married and increasing male life expectancy catching up with female life expectancy,\u201d Sanders said.</p> <p>More men under 65 and more women over 65 live alone because higher proportions of men than women never marry, men tend to marry older than women \u2013 and marry women younger than themselves \u2013 while partnership dissolution often leads to men living alone without their children. Women\u2019s higher life expectancy is also a factor.</p> <p>However, lower numbers of young adults are living alone and an increasing number of them live with their parents. In 2018, one in four young adults aged 20 to 34 years (3.4 million) were estimated to live with their parents. That was a 24% rise on the figure 10 years earlier and 1 million higher than the figure for 2003.</p> <p>Likely causes include high rents and house prices, plus a housing shortage, are probable causes. In 2018, 31.4% of men aged 20 to 34 years lived with their parents, compared with 19.9% of women the same age. The ONS suggested this was because women tended to marry at younger ages than men are possibly more likely to cohabit at younger ages than men. </p> <p>Experts warned that many of the one in eight people aged 16 and over in England and Wales who live together without being married or in a civil partnership - a proportion that has risen for the past 15 years in a row \u2013 have \u201cseverely skewed\u201d expectations of what will happen if one of them dies.</p> <p>\u201cLove just isn\u2019t enough. Cohabiting couples stand to lose it all if the worst happens. You could be left with nothing,\u201d said Dan Garrett, the chief executive of <a href=\"https://farewill.com/\">Farewill</a>, a specialist in wills. According to its research, 24% of British people wrongly believe that if they co-own a property with their partner but are not married, ownership of that property would pass to them on their partner\u2019s death.</p> <p>Another one in five wrongly believe that if they have been cohabiting for more than five years, they will inherit the entirety of their partner\u2019s estate or assume executor status. </p> <p>Neil Russell, a family partner at <a href=\"https://www.seddons.co.uk/\">Seddons Solicitors</a>, said both beliefs were myths. \u201cThere is no such thing as a \u2018common law spouse\u2019. You are married or you are not,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cGovernment legislation continues to lag behind by not providing legal protection to cohabitees on the breakdown of their relationship. Parliament needs to legislate, but in the meantime people need to be informed of the potential dangers of not securing their position in the event of a relationship coming to an end on the breakup or death of a party.\u201d</p>",

The proportion of cohabiting couple families, the second largest family type, has increased from 15.3% to 17.9%, equating to 3.4 million. The number of lone parent families stands at 2.9 million (15% of the total), making them the third-largest group. The data also reveals a significant increase in the number of people living alone, exceeding 8 million for the first time. The data suggests this increase has been driven by rises in women aged 45 to 64 and men aged 65 to 74 years living on their own. The number aged 65 and over and living alone increased by 500,000 or 14.8% between 2008 and 2018, to 3.9 million. \u201cReasons for increases in these age and sex groups include an increasing population aged 45 to 64 years, rises in the proportions who are divorced or never married and increasing male life expectancy catching up with female life expectancy,\u201d Sanders said. More men under 65 and more women over 65 live alone because higher proportions of men than women never marry, men tend to marry older than women \u2013 and marry women younger than themselves \u2013 while partnership dissolution often leads to men living alone without their children. Women\u2019s higher life expectancy is also a factor. However, lower numbers of young adults are living alone and an increasing number of them live with their parents. In 2018, one in four young adults aged 20 to 34 years (3.4 million) were estimated to live with their parents. That was a 24% rise on the figure 10 years earlier and 1 million higher than the figure for 2003. Likely causes include high rents and house prices, plus a housing shortage, are probable causes. In 2018, 31.4% of men aged 20 to 34 years lived with their parents, compared with 19.9% of women the same age. The ONS suggested this was because women tended to marry at younger ages than men are possibly more likely to cohabit at younger ages than men. Experts warned that many of the one in eight people aged 16 and over in England and Wales who live together without being married or in a civil partnership - a proportion that has risen for the past 15 years in a row \u2013 have \u201cseverely skewed\u201d expectations of what will happen if one of them dies. \u201cLove just isn\u2019t enough. Cohabiting couples stand to lose it all if the worst happens. You could be left with nothing,\u201d said Dan Garrett, the chief executive of Farewill, a specialist in wills. According to its research, 24% of British people wrongly believe that if they co-own a property with their partner but are not married, ownership of that property would pass to them on their partner\u2019s death. Another one in five wrongly believe that if they have been cohabiting for more than five years, they will inherit the entirety of their partner\u2019s estate or assume executor status. Neil Russell, a family partner at Seddons Solicitors, said both beliefs were myths. \u201cThere is no such thing as a \u2018common law spouse\u2019. You are married or you are not,\u201d he said. \u201cGovernment legislation continues to lag behind by not providing legal protection to cohabitees on the breakdown of their relationship. Parliament needs to legislate, but in the meantime people need to be informed of the potential dangers of not securing their position in the event of a relationship coming to an end on the breakup or death of a party.\u201d",

The 40-year-old, who also played for Villarreal, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid and Internazionale, revealed his decision on Twitter. He wrote: \u201cAfter 21 years I made the decision to end my career as a professional footballer. A beautiful stage closes full of great memories and emotions but another of new challenges will begin. Thanks to all who in one way or another accompanied me on this path!\u201d Forlan moved to Manchester United from Argentine side Independiente for \u00a36.9m in January 2002. He had to wait until September to score his first goal, and went on to find the net 17 times in 98 appearances. Although his time at Old Trafford was not exactly a roaring success, Forl\u00e1n became a prolific goalscorer in La Liga for both Villarreal and Atl\u00e9tico. He also scored 36 goals in 112 games for Uruguay, helping them to the Copa Am\u00e9rica title in 2011. Forl\u00e1n spoke about his decision on the TeleMundo TV channel. \u201cWhat I lived in these 21 years ... I have no words. I never imagined. It is much, much, much more than what I dreamed as a child,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would have been nice to close my career in Pe\u00f1arol, but it did not happen, the negotiations did not come to fruition.

All that faffing about with egg custards, the swearing and bashed elbows as you dig around for the dusty ice-cream maker at the back of the shed,<a href=\"https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/review/best-ice-cream-makers-test\"> if you even own such a thing</a> in the first place \u2013 all things considered, it\u2019s a lot easier to pop to the shops and shell out for some professional stuff.</p> <p>But, however good the selection in your local supermarket, you\u2019ll be hard pushed to find any flavour more interesting than 25 variations on chocolate, which is where no churn ice-cream comes in. Yes, it\u2019s inevitably a slight compromise, because churning whips air into the mixture, giving the finished product a certain lightness, but do it right, and the results can be surprisingly good, and certainly worth the very minimal effort involved. And once you\u2019ve mastered it, a world of flavour is your oyster. (NB: that isn\u2019t a suggestion; I had<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2011/11/23/142669973/oyster-ice-cream-a-thanksgiving-tradition-mark-twain-could-get-behind\"> oyster ice-cream</a> once on the Ile de R\u00e9 and it was disgusting).</p> <h2>The eggs</h2> <p>Eggs are divisive in ice-cream generally; neither<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2014/sep/03/how-to-make-perfect-kulfi\"> kulfi</a> nor<a href=\"https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2014/12/30-minute-philadelphia-style-ice-cream-recipe.html\"> Philadelphia-style ice-cream</a> require them, and<a href=\"https://www.jamieoliver.com/features/how-to-make-gelato-at-home/\"> gelato</a> tends to contain less than the kind of ice-cream traditionally made in this country. They\u2019re not often used in no-churn ice-cream, probably because they suggest a more complex method than most people are looking for here, but<a href=\"https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/741636/nochurn-ice-cream\"> Mary Berry</a>, pastry chef Stella Parks and New York Times columnist Melissa Clark all stick them in anyway, albeit in very different forms.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"1d816dd0e0724e397dec98087061c2f69082e58f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1d816dd0e0724e397dec98087061c2f69082e58f/0_436_3024_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"BBC Good Food\u2019s no-churn ice-cream isn\u2019t too sweet as it uses a much higher ratio of cream to condensed milk.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">BBC Good Food\u2019s no-churn ice-cream isn\u2019t too sweet as it uses a much higher ratio of cream to condensed milk. Thumbnails: Felicity Cloake.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Berry\u2019s recipe is the simplest, involving beating the egg whites to stiff peaks, then folding them, along with the yolks, into whipped cream for a light, but fairly muted result that might work better with a more strident flavour than vanilla.</p> <p>Clark\u2019s version starts, like a classic ice-cream, with an egg yolk and cream custard, whipped and cooled before freezing, while<a href=\"https://www.seriouseats.com/2018/07/make-amazing-vanilla-ice-cream-with-fresh-dairy-and-no-ice-cream-machine.html\"> Parks whips the eggs themselves</a>, heated to 70C in a bain marie for maximum aeration: \u201cNot meringue (egg whites and sugar would be too lean and too fluffy for ice-cream),\u201d she explains, \u201cand not p\u00e2te a bombe (whipped egg yolks and sugar would be too dense and rich), but whole eggs.\u201d Both of their recipes are delicious, but very rich indeed: the kind of thing even I could only eat a modest portion of, and they\u2019re also pretty labour intensive, which is not what I\u2019m looking for in this instance. If you\u2019re after a no-churn ice-cream to wow your guests, then these are the badgers.

      "bodyText": "I love ice-cream more than almost anything else in the world \u2013 but I\u2019ll be honest, I don\u2019t love making it. All that faffing about with egg custards, the swearing and bashed elbows as you dig around for the dusty ice-cream maker at the back of the shed, if you even own such a thing in the first place \u2013 all things considered, it\u2019s a lot easier to pop to the shops and shell out for some professional stuff. But, however good the selection in your local supermarket, you\u2019ll be hard pushed to find any flavour more interesting than 25 variations on chocolate, which is where no churn ice-cream comes in. Yes, it\u2019s inevitably a slight compromise, because churning whips air into the mixture, giving the finished product a certain lightness, but do it right, and the results can be surprisingly good, and certainly worth the very minimal effort involved. And once you\u2019ve mastered it, a world of flavour is your oyster. (NB: that isn\u2019t a suggestion; I had oyster ice-cream once on the Ile de R\u00e9 and it was disgusting). The eggs Eggs are divisive in ice-cream generally; neither kulfi nor Philadelphia-style ice-cream require them, and gelato tends to contain less than the kind of ice-cream traditionally made in this country. They\u2019re not often used in no-churn ice-cream, probably because they suggest a more complex method than most people are looking for here, but Mary Berry, pastry chef Stella Parks and New York Times columnist Melissa Clark all stick them in anyway, albeit in very different forms. Berry\u2019s recipe is the simplest, involving beating the egg whites to stiff peaks, then folding them, along with the yolks, into whipped cream for a light, but fairly muted result that might work better with a more strident flavour than vanilla. Clark\u2019s version starts, like a classic ice-cream, with an egg yolk and cream custard, whipped and cooled before freezing, while Parks whips the eggs themselves, heated to 70C in a bain marie for maximum aeration: \u201cNot meringue (egg whites and sugar would be too lean and too fluffy for ice-cream),\u201d she explains, \u201cand not p\u00e2te a bombe (whipped egg yolks and sugar would be too dense and rich), but whole eggs.\u201d Both of their recipes are delicious, but very rich indeed: the kind of thing even I could only eat a modest portion of, and they\u2019re also pretty labour intensive, which is not what I\u2019m looking for in this instance. If you\u2019re after a no-churn ice-cream to wow your guests, then these are the badgers. If you\u2019re just looking for something to knock up to eat straight from the tub on a hot day, however, then they might be surplus to requirements. The dairy In fact, I don\u2019t think eggs are necessary at all; they\u2019re too rich for my purposes. Both Martha Stewart and BBC Good Food make very decent ice-cream without, but using condensed milk, which, thanks to its relatively low water content, also has the benefit of giving the finished product a smooth, almost velvety consistency. Interestingly Clark reckons cream cheese is the key to \u201ca silky texture without the ice crystals that plague other no-churn ice-cream recipes\u201d which \u201chelps hold the custard\u2019s emulsification even during freezing\u201d. Her ice-cream does have a superb silkiness, but it\u2019s not significantly superior texture-wise, in our opinion, to the better condensed milk versions.

      "body": "<p>Bryan Washington focuses on his native Houston for his first book, <em>Lot</em>. Houston is prosperous yet, like many cities in the US, thousands of its inhabitants are only one missed paycheck away from ruin. In this enthralling collection of interconnected short stories, Washington vividly portrays the interior lives of his marginalised fellow citizens, often overlooked in literature save as characters sketched to elicit pity and despair. These are tough yet tender tales of uncertain existences, stalked by the certainty of future violence and the shadow of homelessness.</p> <p>The jeopardy the characters face is magnified both by the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, which blew through the city in 2017, killing more than 100 people, and by the encroaching gentrification that will further displace them. Each story is located in a different district \u2013 some are set in salubrious gated communities, but most are grounded in rough and forbidding neighbourhoods.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The sense grows of the characters\u2019 inability to escape the closed circuits of their desperate lives</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In subtle but bruising prose, Washington deftly conjures an idiosyncratic world in which people live cheek by jowl. A father drowns a dog because none of the children will walk it; a nervous mother packs her daughter off to college with a knife slipped into a pillowcase; a pair of drug dealers style themselves as non-discriminating \u201cequal opportunity pharmacists\u201d. Washington has said he wanted \u201cevery narrative in <em>Lot</em> to have a queer character or queer component\u201d, and a recurring teenage narrator, wrestling with his homosexuality and the repressive environment in which he lives, serves as the book\u2019s emotional centre. Nicol\u00e1s, his siblings and parents (a black mother and feckless Latino father) live above their restaurant in relative comfort, surrounded by basic \u201cshotgun\u201d dwellings with busted TVs and perennially blocked pipes, the kind of houses \u201cyou shook your head at when you drove up the road\u201d.</p> <p>While waiting tables, his mother negotiates the necessary but unwelcome attention of potentially generous-tipping customers: she \u201cshot all of the [suitors] down \u2026 just enough to have them thinking they were always in striking distance\u201d. Her allure, though, is lost on her unfaithful husband, whose lover, the brothers speculate, is probably white, because \u201cWhy the fuck would he leave home to go back home?\u201d Nicol\u00e1s\u2019s father unashamedly brings him along on a visit to her: this is a world where everything is hidden in plain view.</p> <p>Nicol\u00e1s\u2019s father may escape society\u2019s censure, but the infidelity of a female Jamaican immigrant has dire consequences for her illicit lover, a nerdy \u201cwhiteboy\u201d interloper whose every move is monitored by neighbours. They become a Greek chorus of whispering critics who inflame her cuckolded partner\u2019s brutal revenge. A critique of the way a group mentality can limit individuality and thwart nonconformity courses through the book. At the funeral of a murdered local youth, Nicol\u00e1s recounts his brother\u2019s warning that \u201cthis was what happened to fags\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWaugh\u201d, a tale of male sex workers who share a house, explores the near impossibility of a relationship with a \u201cjohn\u201d developing from transactional to tender. Its theme is echoed in \u201cShepherd\u201d, when a classical music-loving Jamaican sex worker who is grieving over the death of her baby visits aspirational relatives in Houston. Her glamour stuns her confused adolescent cousin \u2013 \u201cher dress glowed a shade of margarita\u201d, \u201cshe smiled like mandolins ringing\u201d \u2013 and she offers herself to him as a shortcut to his sexual awakening.</p> <p>As the stories follow and contextualise each other, the sense grows of the characters\u2019 inability to escape the closed circuits of their desperate lives. Avery, a conflicted drug dealer, is crestfallen when he discovers his son \u2013 whose attendance at university ought to have provided a passport out of the ghetto \u2013 homeless, trying to score drugs on the streets.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jun/05/best-books-of-2019-so-far\">Best books of 2019 so far</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In \u201cNavigation\u201d, Nicol\u00e1s, now an adult, is tasked with menial chores, sweeping up and gutting pigs in a restaurant. He stumbles into an affair with a customer and struggles, as do other characters, to navigate that liminal state between temporariness and permanence, between physical sex and platonic love.</p> <p>A number of these stories stop abruptly in the midst of a profound realisation; far from being irritating, Washington\u2019s technique here mirrors the fleeting lucidity of his characters, who are usually in a fug of alcohol, and their casual acceptance of disastrous events. This is most tellingly illustrated in a digression in \u201cWaugh\u201d, by a chilling account of an encounter at a military checkpoint in an unnamed Central American country. The driver realises that when the sentry says the car is too full, it\u2019s code for the fact that he will be executed.</p> <p>Only in the elegiac final story, a lament for the loss of youth and family ties as well as the end of the neighbourhood, does Nicol\u00e1s break free from the stultifying crucible of Houston\u2019s \u2019hoods. He heads for the coast and, in a kind of self-actualising baptism into a new life, wades into the water. Nicol\u00e1s is yet to find a language to express the powerful feelings that have left him broken.

These are tough yet tender tales of uncertain existences, stalked by the certainty of future violence and the shadow of homelessness. The jeopardy the characters face is magnified both by the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, which blew through the city in 2017, killing more than 100 people, and by the encroaching gentrification that will further displace them. Each story is located in a different district \u2013 some are set in salubrious gated communities, but most are grounded in rough and forbidding neighbourhoods. In subtle but bruising prose, Washington deftly conjures an idiosyncratic world in which people live cheek by jowl. A father drowns a dog because none of the children will walk it; a nervous mother packs her daughter off to college with a knife slipped into a pillowcase; a pair of drug dealers style themselves as non-discriminating \u201cequal opportunity pharmacists\u201d. Washington has said he wanted \u201cevery narrative in Lot to have a queer character or queer component\u201d, and a recurring teenage narrator, wrestling with his homosexuality and the repressive environment in which he lives, serves as the book\u2019s emotional centre. Nicol\u00e1s, his siblings and parents (a black mother and feckless Latino father) live above their restaurant in relative comfort, surrounded by basic \u201cshotgun\u201d dwellings with busted TVs and perennially blocked pipes, the kind of houses \u201cyou shook your head at when you drove up the road\u201d. While waiting tables, his mother negotiates the necessary but unwelcome attention of potentially generous-tipping customers: she \u201cshot all of the [suitors] down \u2026 just enough to have them thinking they were always in striking distance\u201d. Her allure, though, is lost on her unfaithful husband, whose lover, the brothers speculate, is probably white, because \u201cWhy the fuck would he leave home to go back home?\u201d Nicol\u00e1s\u2019s father unashamedly brings him along on a visit to her: this is a world where everything is hidden in plain view. Nicol\u00e1s\u2019s father may escape society\u2019s censure, but the infidelity of a female Jamaican immigrant has dire consequences for her illicit lover, a nerdy \u201cwhiteboy\u201d interloper whose every move is monitored by neighbours. They become a Greek chorus of whispering critics who inflame her cuckolded partner\u2019s brutal revenge. A critique of the way a group mentality can limit individuality and thwart nonconformity courses through the book. At the funeral of a murdered local youth, Nicol\u00e1s recounts his brother\u2019s warning that \u201cthis was what happened to fags\u201d. \u201cWaugh\u201d, a tale of male sex workers who share a house, explores the near impossibility of a relationship with a \u201cjohn\u201d developing from transactional to tender. Its theme is echoed in \u201cShepherd\u201d, when a classical music-loving Jamaican sex worker who is grieving over the death of her baby visits aspirational relatives in Houston. Her glamour stuns her confused adolescent cousin \u2013 \u201cher dress glowed a shade of margarita\u201d, \u201cshe smiled like mandolins ringing\u201d \u2013 and she offers herself to him as a shortcut to his sexual awakening. As the stories follow and contextualise each other, the sense grows of the characters\u2019 inability to escape the closed circuits of their desperate lives. Avery, a conflicted drug dealer, is crestfallen when he discovers his son \u2013 whose attendance at university ought to have provided a passport out of the ghetto \u2013 homeless, trying to score drugs on the streets. In \u201cNavigation\u201d, Nicol\u00e1s, now an adult, is tasked with menial chores, sweeping up and gutting pigs in a restaurant. He stumbles into an affair with a customer and struggles, as do other characters, to navigate that liminal state between temporariness and permanence, between physical sex and platonic love. A number of these stories stop abruptly in the midst of a profound realisation; far from being irritating, Washington\u2019s technique here mirrors the fleeting lucidity of his characters, who are usually in a fug of alcohol, and their casual acceptance of disastrous events. This is most tellingly illustrated in a digression in \u201cWaugh\u201d, by a chilling account of an encounter at a military checkpoint in an unnamed Central American country. The driver realises that when the sentry says the car is too full, it\u2019s code for the fact that he will be executed. Only in the elegiac final story, a lament for the loss of youth and family ties as well as the end of the neighbourhood, does Nicol\u00e1s break free from the stultifying crucible of Houston\u2019s \u2019hoods. He heads for the coast and, in a kind of self-actualising baptism into a new life, wades into the water. Nicol\u00e1s is yet to find a language to express the powerful feelings that have left him broken. Washington, however, already possesses a compelling and seasoned writer\u2019s voice. \u2022 Lot by Bryan Washington is published by Atlantic (RRP \u00a312.99).

I was changed every time I read one of Toni Morrison\u2019s. Masterful control of both form and storytelling. Always bold. Thank you. PsueDenim \u2018Now her words of wisdom are needed most\u2019 I absolutely loved Toni Morrison\u2019s book, but more than that I loved what she represented. A true giant bestriding the realms of freedom and imagination. It\u2019s so sad that she should leave us now when her words of wisdom are needed most. She has done a great deal to beautify millions of lives and I hope she knew before she passed away. She was loved for her books, the hope she represented, the strength she embodied. May all she embodied ever march on in majesty with future generations. gavernism \u2018She wrote in a way that set people free\u2019 Toni Morrison was majestic. She wrote and lived in a way that set people free. I can think of no greater calling, no greater achievement. Some of her words that have shaped my working life: \u201cI tell my students, \u2018When you get these jobs that you have been so brilliantly trained for, just remember that your real job is that if you are free, you need to free somebody else ... This is not just a grab-bag candy game.\u2019\u201d So much of her 1975 lecture and Q&amp;A, A Humanist View, has shaped my understanding of what it means to be an artist, and to be a person. Thank you, Toni Morrison, and Rest In Power. MalaclypseTheYounger \u2018Her works were as complex as life itself\u2019 Her works were as complex as life itself. Playing in the Dark: Whiteness and the Literary Imagination, her post-Nobel collection of essays, for me, was her most powerful statement on southern racism and the deliberate invisibility in the portrayal of African-American existence in white-authored southern literature. Toni Morrison was the most powerful answer to black artistry in a white-dominated world that envisaged the African-American writer, at best, with wistful tolerance at its most polite and amused contempt, at its most extremely conservative. A life fully and satisfactorily lived. Godspeed, Auntie Toni! Africa4 \u2018An important contributor to the discussion of the African-American experience\u2019 Sad loss. A towering figure in world literature, and an important contributor to the enduring discussion of the African-American experience. Beloved takes a long hard look through that history, and burns powerfully in any reader\u2019s imagination. Rest in peace, Toni, a peace so richly deserved. dylan37 \u2018She used words for freedom and truth\u2019 Gutted. Toni Morrison used words for the purposes of freedom and emotional truth.

We would let the Scottish people decide. That\u2019s democracy.\u201d The notion of Holyrood voting for a referendum, only for a future Labour government in Westminster to stand in its way, is indeed hard, if not impossible, for any democrat to defend. Sure, some will argue that Scotland had its once-in-a-generation chance to decide in 2014. But that\u2019s tricky to sustain when Labour is (sort of) committed to holding a second referendum on Brexit, even though that decision was supposedly settled just three years ago. Surely democratic consistency demands precisely the stance McDonnell has now taken.</p> <p>And yet the way the shadow chancellor made this move could hardly have been worse. First, he said this: \u201cThe Scottish parliament will come to a considered view \u2026 and they will submit that to the government and the English parliament itself.\u201d Doubtless, he will insist it was a mere slip of the tongue, but to refer to Westminster as \u201cthe English parliament\u201d, when it is of course the sovereign body of the entire UK, is far more serious than that. At a stroke, McDonnell was confirming the nationalist view that sees Scotland as ruled by England, rather than as a member of a union of nations.

In March, the leader of the Scottish Labour party, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/nov/18/richard-leonard-voted-scottish-labour-leader\" title=\"\">Richard Leonard</a>, said that a future UK Labour government would refuse to grant the so-called <a href=\"https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/17819772.john-mcdonnell-labour-not-block-independence-referendum/\" title=\"\">section 30 order</a> required for another vote on independence. McDonnell\u2019s remarks reverse that entirely. You might imagine that such a major shift on such a profound constitutional question would come after a serious process of debate and consultation inside the Labour party, and inside Scottish Labour in particular. Once that process was complete, perhaps the right person to have made the announcement would have been Leonard himself (who, it\u2019s worth saying, is a loyal supporter of McDonnell and Jeremy Corbyn). Instead, it came from an MP for an English constituency, delivered off-the-cuff during an on-stage interview at the Edinburgh festival. That hardly conveys respect for the Scottish Labour party \u2013 so often derided as a \u201cbranch office\u201d of UK Labour \u2013 or for the union itself.</p> <p>McDonnell\u2019s motive for dropping Labour\u2019s opposition to a fresh independence vote is not mysterious: he wants to be able to offer a referendum to the Scottish National party in talks following a hung parliament at a possibly imminent general election.

Now McDonnell has signalled that Labour is ready to jettison all that for party advantage. At a stroke it robs Labour of the ability to lay precisely that charge against the Tories, who are themselves jeopardising the union in their pursuit of a hard Brexit. Now Labour will need to hold their tongues, because McDonnell\u2019s move proves they too are ready to risk the union if it serves their party interests to do so.</p> <p>And yet the most obvious objection to McDonnell\u2019s move is far less high-minded.

A half-sister to a Lennox Stakes winner, this unexposed filly got her first win at Epsom last month, when she went from last to first and quickly took advantage of a gap that had been slow to appear.

This would lower the price of imports \u2013 making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO \u201cmost favoured nation\u201d rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.<br></p>\n    <p>WTO rules only cover goods \u2013 they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK\u2019s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.<br></p>\n    <p>Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article 24 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to 10 years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article 24 unilaterally \u2013 the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK\u2019s trading relationship.<br></p>\n    <p>The director general of the WTO, Roberto Azev\u00eado, has <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/economics-and-finance/jumping-from-league-one-to-league-three-wto-insiders-scathing-assessments-of-a-wto-brexit\">told Prospect magazine</a> that \u201cin simple factual terms in this scenario, you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the UK and EU where currently there are none\u201d.</p>\n    <p>Until some agreements are in place, a no-deal scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses \u2013 eg the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europe after 31 October if there is no deal. Those arguing for a \u201cmanaged\u201d no deal envisage that a range of smaller, sector-by-sector, bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.</p>\n    <p><b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a></b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Many trade experts, from the government\u2019s own analysts to the Bank of England, expect a no-deal Brexit to cause severe disruption at ports, potentially delaying food imports.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s food and drinks industry has asked the government to suspend competition law in the event of a no-deal Brexit so that firms can work together to avert food shortages without facing large fines for collusion. Collaboration between large companies is controlled to prevent cartels harming consumers\u2019 interests. The Food and Drink Federation (FDF) told the BBC the government had not yet confirmed whether companies would be able to work together to direct food supplies to the areas of greatest need if there were delays as a result of crashing out of the EU. Many trade experts, from the government\u2019s own analysts to the Bank of England, expect a no-deal Brexit to cause severe disruption at ports, potentially delaying food imports. Boris Johnson has committed to leaving the EU on 31 October whatever the implications, and has put Michael Gove in charge of preparing to exit without a deal. FDF members, including large companies such as Associated British Foods, Mondel\u0113z and Nestl\u00e9, risked incurring large fines from the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) if they collaborated, the industry body said. \u201cCompetition law is important, but in the event of no-deal disruption, if the government wants the food supply chain to work together to tackle likely shortages \u2013 to decide where to prioritise shipments \u2013 they will have to provide cast-iron written reassurances that competition law will not be strictly applied to those discussions,\u201d FDF\u2019s chief operating officer, Tim Rycroft, said.

      "bodyText": "The EU\u2019s member states have given their \u201cbroad support\u201d to the collection of the personal data of people travelling on high-speed trains and even on Europe\u2019s roads in an expansion of a directive that covers airline passengers. Despite concerns in some capitals that the move would amount to a disproportionate infringement of privacy or create travel delays, it has won the backing of a majority of member states, according to internal documents. Under the passenger name record (PNR) directive, about 42 separate pieces of information are collected in advance on those travelling on scheduled and charter flights within the EU and entering it, including itinerary, bank card details, home address, seat number and baggage information. The records are used by the police and security services to screen passengers before departure to identify potential terror and serious crime suspects and track their movements. Belgium, which is the only EU member state to also impose such reporting requirements on operators of international trains, coaches and ferries under its PNR legislation for national use, is among those who want the pan-European scheme to be expanded. A confidential EU document published by the website Statewatch reveals that 83% of its member states back the expansion of the PNR directive to maritime travel and 76% to railways. A majority of member states (67%) is also said to be in support of an expansion to cover road traffic, such as international coach services, according to the EU questionnaire, although this proposition is not being prioritised given the logistical problems it poses. The document reports: \u201cThe negative replies highlighted arguments related to the increase of data to be processed by [passenger information units], something which was unlikely to be manageable, and could even be seen as an intrusion into privacy.\u201d \u201cOverall, Member States were in favour of broadening the scope of data collection to other types of transportation, but that it was important to first implement of the PNR Directive as it is, ensure that PIUs [passenger information units \u2013 the offices each member state must set up for travel data collection] can manage the PNR data and are fully operational,\u201d the paper adds. Earlier this summer, the Community of European Railway and Infrastructure Companies, which represents the transport sector, warned that international train journeys to or from Belgium were likely to take 20 to 30 minutes longer due to the obligations the government is due to impose. The Belgian government is currently piloting its plans which would involve inspectors checking whether a name on the train ticket matches the passenger\u2019s national identity card or passport. A second EU document \u2013 written last month by the government of Finland, which currently holds the bloc\u2019s rolling presidency \u2013 reports that law enforcement agencies are struggling to respond to the rise in travel within and in and out of Europe. \u201cIncreasing cross-border travelling entails cross-border crime such as migrant smuggling and irregular migration arrangements, which involves third-country nationals that are smuggled into the EU territories, or narcotic drugs smugglers, terrorists and other criminals,\u201d the paper says. \u2018\u201cThis poses a growing challenge to national law enforcement authorities in combating crime.\u201d The confidential document adds: \u201cThe Presidency suggests continuing the discussion about widening the scope of the PNR Directive to other forms of transportation than air traffic. \u201cThese other forms of transportation could be for example sea traffic and international high speed trains.\u201d Any expansion of the PNR would require scrutiny and approval by the European parliament.

Aside from David Williams, they\u2019re all Hispanic. But it\u2019s Williams who adds: \u201cIt\u2019s a clash of cultures, it\u2019s Hispanic versus white.\u201d Everyone nods in agreement.</p> <p>While it was racism that compelled the shooter to draft a hate-filled manifesto aimed at Hispanics, racism that pushed him to drive 10 hours to the border and attack a community over 80% Latino, the shooting served to highlight the starkly different cultures that came together that day: one culture comprising large extended families living in close proximity and with strong religious ties, and another more fractured and isolated in the sprawling suburbs of the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex.</p> <p>All day, Williams, a local surgeon, has been hearing the same thing from his neighbors and fellow El Pasoans: \u201cThis kind of thing would never happen here,\u201d meaning someone from El Paso would never carry out such an act of mass violence. His wife, Elizabeth O\u2019Hara, a former journalist who is Hispanic and grew up in El Paso, has even told him: \u201cBrown people don\u2019t do this kind of thing.\u201d</p> <p>Now, standing next to her husband, she adds: \u201cI finally had to ask him, \u2018What is wrong with your people?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The question had been bothering him long before she asked, he says, particularly every time a lone white male opened fire on a large group of people. And while Williams is no sociologist (he\u2019s a podiatrist), his own experience marrying into a large Hispanic family in a predominantly Hispanic city had given him perspective into this particular tragedy.</p> <p>White people, he says, have spent the last half century closing themselves off in the suburbs, originally to separate from minorities. In the process, our families have fractured and gotten smaller, our visits less frequent, until the only time we see our extended kin is on Facebook or at funerals. Williams is speaking from his own family\u2019s experience, but it\u2019s similar to mine and that of many white Americans.</p> <p>\u201cBut that is not El Paso,\u201d Williams says. \u201cEl Paso is exactly the opposite. Here you\u2019re gonna have your parents, grandparents, cousins, aunts and uncles always around, whether you like it or not. Most families see each other on a weekly basis, if not more. On the weekends, you can drive by any El Paso park and they\u2019re full of Hispanic families cooking out, listening to music, playing volleyball, just being together. You rarely see a white family doing that.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b7f33315cf3108158eb1fc0ba1a4ff8202299815\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b7f33315cf3108158eb1fc0ba1a4ff8202299815/0_0_5472_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jose Ozuna installs American flags next to crime scene tape at a makeshift memorial honoring victims outside the Cielo Vista Walmart in El Paso.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jose Ozuna installs American flags next to crime scene tape at a makeshift memorial honoring victims outside the Cielo Vista Walmart in El Paso.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mario Tama/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s very hard for a member of that community to not feel supported,\u201d he adds. \u201cThere\u2019s always someone to talk to.

I do think there is a clash of cultures and maybe that\u2019s why we don\u2019t see darker-skinned people doing this kind of mass killing.\u201d</p> <p>The research backs it up, says James Alan Fox, a professor at Northeastern University who\u2019s studied and written extensively on the subject, most recently in the book Extreme Killing: Understanding Serial and Mass Murder. Especially strength in community. \u201cMass shooters generally don\u2019t have a strong support network,\u201d Fox says. \u201cPeople who have the support of friends, neighbors and families have a sounding board to help get them through the hard times and help give them a reality check.\u201d</p> <p>That sense of community is what brought Arturo Rodriguez back to his hometown from Las Vegas, where he lived for over 20 years while serving in the air force. In fact, Rodriguez\u2019s daughter was attending the Route 91 Harvest music festival in October 2017 when another terrorist gunman opened fire from the 32nd floor of a nearby hotel, killing 58 and wounding more than 400 others.

And on the bridge itself, just regular Sunday traffic: people from both sides of the border shopping at Paseo de Las Luces and eating ice cream with their kids \u2013 a fraction of the 70,000 people who cross daily to shop and work and attend college the way they\u2019ve done for generations.</p> <p>Watching them lug their plastic bags and push strollers, I\u2019m reminded of what a man said earlier at a restaurant. \u201cI don\u2019t have any answers,\u201d he told me. \u201cBut our wall didn\u2019t stop this guy from coming here and killing us.\u201d</p> <p>When the two cultures came together that day, as Williams says, the result was more than a tragic loss of life.

      "body": "<p>The increasingly intertwined threat posed by gun violence and white nationalist terrorists is real, evil and deadly \u2013 and it is being enabled and encouraged by Donald Trump and the right wing that he has emboldened and embraced.</p> <p>Gun violence is the deadliest violent threat facing America today. The Centers for Disease Control <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/injury.htm\">recorded</a> 39,773 deaths by firearm in 2017. And while it pales in comparison with the gun epidemic, white nationalist terrorism is a growing threat made more deadly by the availability of guns. The Anti-Defamation League <a href=\"https://www.adl.org/media/12480/download\">noted</a> that of the 50 deaths caused by domestic extremists in 2018, \u201cwhite supremacists were responsible for the great majority of the killings\u201d.</p> <p>If this many Americans were killed in a war or foreign terror attack, the US government would be in crisis mode. The president would be convening meetings of the cabinet and state and local officials. Congress would be rushing legislation through the door quicker than legislators could read the bills. The media would cover the issue as religiously as it covers Trump\u2019s tweets.</p> <p>And yet, these issues hardly register in national policy debates, and the reason is the American right wing.</p> <p>For a long time, the right wing has thumped their chests in attempts to show how tough they are on national security. They invaded Iraq because one war in response to 9/11 wasn\u2019t enough. The right wing regularly hype threats of terrorism to advocate for militaristic policies, whether it\u2019s on Iran or Yemen. They constantly demand more defense spending \u2013 just because more is somehow better. They advocate for more and new kinds of nuclear weapons, as though the thousands we already have couldn\u2019t blow up the world enough times.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/06/trump-seeds-violent-white-nationalism\">From Trump to Fox News to 8chan: the web of white supremacist rhetoric is wide | Siva Vaidhyanathan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Perhaps the right wing feels the need to show how \u201ctough\u201d they are because they know they are aiding and abetting a genuine national security threat. The systematic rightwing effort to make it easier to access guns, alongside policies and rhetoric that spew racism and bigotry, make the rightwing enablers of mass murder and inspirations to white nationalist terrorism.</p> <p>Ask just about any expert, law enforcement official, or national security professional who is focused on the issue and they will tell you that commonsense gun-violence-prevention legislation can significantly reduce gun violence. A glance at other countries with stricter gun laws and virtually no gun violence confirms this fact. And yet, the right wing is not only opposed to these laws that would save lives \u2013 it has been working for years to make it easier for Americans to obtain assault weapons.</p> <p>While guns kill tens of thousands every year, white nationalists are using them more and more to carry out their terrorist attacks. A New York Times<em> </em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/04/03/world/white-extremist-terrorism-christchurch.html\">report</a> showed how murders by white nationalists are not only growing around the world \u2013 they are also becoming more and more connected.

      "bodyText": "The increasingly intertwined threat posed by gun violence and white nationalist terrorists is real, evil and deadly \u2013 and it is being enabled and encouraged by Donald Trump and the right wing that he has emboldened and embraced. Gun violence is the deadliest violent threat facing America today. The Centers for Disease Control recorded 39,773 deaths by firearm in 2017. And while it pales in comparison with the gun epidemic, white nationalist terrorism is a growing threat made more deadly by the availability of guns. The Anti-Defamation League noted that of the 50 deaths caused by domestic extremists in 2018, \u201cwhite supremacists were responsible for the great majority of the killings\u201d. If this many Americans were killed in a war or foreign terror attack, the US government would be in crisis mode. The president would be convening meetings of the cabinet and state and local officials. Congress would be rushing legislation through the door quicker than legislators could read the bills. The media would cover the issue as religiously as it covers Trump\u2019s tweets. And yet, these issues hardly register in national policy debates, and the reason is the American right wing. For a long time, the right wing has thumped their chests in attempts to show how tough they are on national security. They invaded Iraq because one war in response to 9/11 wasn\u2019t enough. The right wing regularly hype threats of terrorism to advocate for militaristic policies, whether it\u2019s on Iran or Yemen. They constantly demand more defense spending \u2013 just because more is somehow better. They advocate for more and new kinds of nuclear weapons, as though the thousands we already have couldn\u2019t blow up the world enough times. Perhaps the right wing feels the need to show how \u201ctough\u201d they are because they know they are aiding and abetting a genuine national security threat. The systematic rightwing effort to make it easier to access guns, alongside policies and rhetoric that spew racism and bigotry, make the rightwing enablers of mass murder and inspirations to white nationalist terrorism. Ask just about any expert, law enforcement official, or national security professional who is focused on the issue and they will tell you that commonsense gun-violence-prevention legislation can significantly reduce gun violence. A glance at other countries with stricter gun laws and virtually no gun violence confirms this fact. And yet, the right wing is not only opposed to these laws that would save lives \u2013 it has been working for years to make it easier for Americans to obtain assault weapons. While guns kill tens of thousands every year, white nationalists are using them more and more to carry out their terrorist attacks. A New York Times report showed how murders by white nationalists are not only growing around the world \u2013 they are also becoming more and more connected. And the right wing in the United States are helping these terrorists by leading the way with hateful, racist language and policies that terrorists cite in explaining their murderous acts. Trump has lit a match to this powder keg. Rightwing support for white nationalists can now be seen weekly in the Oval Office. Trump regularly refers to immigrants and minorities as part of an \u201cinvasion\u201d and \u201cinfestation\u201d, fueling the white nationalist conspiracy theory of the \u201cgreat replacement\u201d in which \u201cother\u201d people are supposedly trying to replace white Americans. In Charlottesville in 2017, white supremacists murdered Heather Heyer at a neo-Nazi rally where people were chanting \u201cJews will not replace us\u201d \u2013 after which Trump called them \u201cvery fine people\u201d.

Our brain has spent so many millions of years geared toward facial recognition, it takes even the most random nonsense and attempts to construct it into something meaningful.</p> <p>My brain, it turns out, does a similar thing when I read the tweets of Brexit MEP Ben Habib. \u201cI am on the border between NI and ROI,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/benhabib6/status/1156905045239185410\" title=\"\">he </a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/benhabib6/status/1156905045239185410\" title=\"\">tweeted last week</a>, above a video that depicted him and some colleagues wisely playing in the middle of the road. \u201cTravelling in a straight line, one enters and exits the ROI a number of times.

Or because there isn\u2019t one there currently? Perhaps Habib thinks the world is just full of things now, and new things can\u2019t be built in spaces where those things don\u2019t currently exist. One wonders what it would be like to watch <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/sep/19/grand-designs-tiny-folly-review\" title=\"\">Grand Designs</a> with him, to feel his innocent thrill at the impossibility of these wondrous structures as they miraculously appear in places where once they weren\u2019t. Of course, it\u2019s hard to know exactly what he meant, or whence came the ebullience with which he meant it since, again, my brain is working overtime to ascribe sense where none exists.</p> <p>I don\u2019t know much about Habib\u2019s little border crossing jaunt; I do hope he had a nice time, perhaps returning home with some agricultural diesel or a few nice boxty recipes.

Because that\u2019s where I was born and raised.</p> <p>My family home is on Derry\u2019s western border with Donegal. I mean \u201con\u201d here quite literally. For most of my childhood, our garden backed on to a UK customs checkpoint which sat at the terminus of land behind our garage. I\u2019m sure this isn\u2019t some red herring I\u2019ve imagined, because I\u2019d have likely conjured a more thrilling sight than the squat little prefab that blighted our view of the main road until 1997. On the other hand, however fevered my imagination, I doubt I could have made up the time an IRA bomb blast destroyed that building, damaging our windows and blowing a section of its wall into our field \u2013 with its kitchen sink still attached.</p> <p>I\u2019ve lived on the hard border and faced some small part of the harm it can do to a place. It takes a certain lack of seriousness to say that something is impossible just because it has never happened before. It takes an altogether different level of ineptitude to say a thing is impossible, when it only very recently stopped happening, having done so for eight decades before that.</p> <p>The hard border is not currently there because of its relaxation under the terms of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/14/good-friday-agreement-ireland-brexit-tony-blair-bertie-ahern\" title=\"\">Good Friday </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/14/good-friday-agreement-ireland-brexit-tony-blair-bertie-ahern\" title=\"\">agreement</a>, underpinned by the fact that both the UK and Ireland are EU states.

It would be odd if we were merely having to point this out to those who, admirably enough, advocate pulling down the barriers between nations.

Most people have experienced pareidolia, that pleasing effect of interpreting a face from a random assortment of objects or shapes, so that a paperclip and two blobs of adhesive putty look like a happy little man, or the watermarks behind Auntie Maureen\u2019s radiator strike her as a dead ringer for the Virgin Mary. Our brain has spent so many millions of years geared toward facial recognition, it takes even the most random nonsense and attempts to construct it into something meaningful. My brain, it turns out, does a similar thing when I read the tweets of Brexit MEP Ben Habib. \u201cI am on the border between NI and ROI,\u201d he tweeted last week, above a video that depicted him and some colleagues wisely playing in the middle of the road. \u201cTravelling in a straight line, one enters and exits the ROI a number of times. There could never be a hard border here. The UK has declared it would never seek to impose one. The whole thing is a red herring.\u201d Surely, I thought, this was a pleasing moment of candour from a man who had seen just how unworkable a border would be, who had stood where it once was, and realised that such a self-defeating arrangement must never be put in place again.

      "body": "<p>Sam Thompson is standing at the end of the footpath that he is helping to save. There is no sign, just a gate and a post adorned with a few strands of barbed wire. \u201cI started walking this route a few months ago. It connects to woods that otherwise I\u2019d have to walk through a housing estate to reach.\u201d </p> <p>We are in the York suburb of Acomb, a former village now swamped by sprawling post-second-world-war housing developments. To outsiders, it can seem like a maze of long bends and cul-de-sacs with extraordinary numbers of speed bumps. We climb the gate and start down a narrow path lined by tall grasses, soon dodging through a hedge to emerge in a wild meadow, beyond which lies a line of trees. The change from brick and asphalt to rural beauty is dramatic and totally unexpected.</p> <p>A few months ago, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/04/memory-lanes-the-ramblers-trying-to-save-10000-lost-footpaths\" title=\"\">I wrote a story in these pages</a> about the urgent need to identify and reclaim lost rights of way in Britain. After the story appeared, a member of the UK walking charity <a href=\"https://www.ramblers.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Ramblers</a> posted handwritten notes through all the houses on Thompson\u2019s street alerting them to a local path under threat. It was a path that was used but its legal status was uncertain. Boots on the ground were needed. \u201cThis path has changed my perception of Acomb,\u201d Thompson says. \u201cThe fact that I can be in fields and woods so quickly: I\u2019m definitely happier and more at home now.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/dec/04/share-your-experiences-of-lost-footpaths\">He wrote </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/dec/04/share-your-experiences-of-lost-footpaths\">to </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/dec/04/share-your-experiences-of-lost-footpaths\">the Guardian</a> to tell us about it, and he was one of many: we received tales of ongoing battles and those that had only just begun. Readers described finding fallen footpath signs and heading off through beds of nettles to identify local rights of way that had been forgotten. Others, working from maps, began to discover lost paths in their own neighbourhoods while a considerable number had been reminded of lost routes they had known as children. There were cases of schools putting up fences that blocked much-loved and well-used routes across playing fields. A huge range of issues were raised: <a href=\"https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2017-07-17/intensive-numbers-of-intensive-farming\" title=\"\">changes in farming</a> practices, austerity cuts to local government, access to coast and riverbanks, access to riverbanks when the river moves and ones pertaining to the law about paths that have been established by regular public usage (a footpath can be established as a right of way by regular use for 20 years if there has been no<strong> </strong>attempt to prevent access by the landowner).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"88c6bfd6cc66627657992f4d1035f1abd1c9b76f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/88c6bfd6cc66627657992f4d1035f1abd1c9b76f/0_219_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sam Thompson at the footpath entrance in Acomb, York.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sam Thompson at the footpath entrance in Acomb, York.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Rushby/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the Ramblers,<strong> </strong>the Guardian reader response was deeply felt and appreciated. \u201cAround 4,000 copies of our <a href=\"https://www.ramblers.org.uk/get-involved/campaign-with-us/dont-lose-your-way-2026.aspx\">practical guide to saving footpaths </a>were downloaded,\u201d says Jack Cornish, the coordinator for the Don\u2019t Lose Your Way project. \u201cLots of people got in touch with personal stories. It was fantastic. Of course, the process takes time, but I\u2019m sure we\u2019re going to save hundreds of miles of previously unidentified rights of way.\u201d</p> <p>He is under no illusions about the significance. \u201cThe response highlights how much more is out there. There are large areas of the country from which we hear very little. Potentially, there are thousands more miles that could disappear without immediate action. We urgently need more people to get involved.\u201d</p> <p>The reason for the urgency is the UK government\u2019s decision to set 1 January 2026 as a deadline for applications to change definitive maps held by local councils. These maps are supposed to show every public right of way in existence, but in practice, they do not. When the maps were drawn up in 1949, the recording process was patchy and fairly arbitrary: some parishes faithfully set down all their paths, some managed a proportion, others did almost nothing.</p> <p>Some of the omissions are shocking: drovers\u2019 roads used for centuries suddenly truncated, key access ways to historic sites or coastal features vanished. One reader found a local walk that simply ended in the middle of a wood, an orphan caused by the boundary between Herefordshire and Shropshire. \u201cIt was great fun researching the history of the footpath and I learned a huge amount,\u201d he says. The application is now lodged, and despite the frustrating pace at which local authorities are examining each case, the application will stand, beyond the 2026 deadline if necessary.</p> <p>Near St Just in Cornwall, a Guardian reader discovered a vital path connecting to the south-west coastal route. \u201cIt was almost invisible due to high ferns growing all over, but it was possible to follow the traces. It is not a long stretch and could be cleared with a brush cutter.\u201d</p> <p>In Devon a group of locals, the Brentor Commons Association, identified a lost drover\u2019s path then got a grant from the <a href=\"https://www.coop.co.uk/local-causes\" title=\"\">Co-op Local Causes</a> to fund restoration. Their centuries-old path, now named The Holloway, has become a popular local walk.</p> <p>In Leintwardine, Herefordshire, estate maps from 1780 helped Jonathan Hopkinson identify a lost way, possibly part of a Roman road. The application to change the definitive map is now under way and Hopkinson has identified two further paths that will help create a circular route.</p> <p>For Jack Cornish, a key discovery of the project has been the history behind every lost footpath. One right of way was rediscovered after an observant art-lover spotted an interesting aspect to a <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/gainsborough-wooded-landscape-with-a-peasant-resting-n01283\" title=\"\">Gainsborough painting in</a><a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/gainsborough-wooded-landscape-with-a-peasant-resting-n01283\" title=\"\"> Tate Britain</a>. \u201cHe had worked out the spot where Gainsborough had painted the picture in 1747 and, from that, after checking old maps, had realised that the artist had been using a footpath, one subsequently lost.\u201d</p> <p>Stephen Whittle had a similar experience with an 1892 painting by Thomas Prytherch that showed an access lane down to the River Severn at Wroxeter, an ancient route and one Stephen had used as a child to go swimming, but which was now blocked by gates. Maps from the 19th century back up his claim.</p> <p>The battle for rights of way is certainly not a new one. Prof Eric Jones, an emeritus professor at Melbourne\u2019s La Trobe University and the author of Landed Estates and Rural Inequality in English History, has found many examples of losses going back to the 17th century. \u201cThe appropriation of rights of way,\u201d he writes, \u201cis a perpetual but surprisingly overlooked aspect of England\u2019s much-studied landscape.\u201d Preferences for privacy and fine views led landowners to demolish villages and reroute, or simply obliterate, roads and paths. Jones points to a typical case in Methley, West Yorkshire, when, in 1627, Sir Henry Savile built a new park and refused to countenance \u201ca common road way\u201d through it. The right of way simply disappeared.</p> <p>At some point, all of us have probably wondered why the routes of certain roads can be so capricious, suddenly darting around an apparently unnecessary right angle. The answer is often in the past. The A350 between Shaftesbury and Blandford Forum, for example, does a big loop to avoid a certain fish pond, the property in the 17th century of the Beckford family, whose sugar plantations in Jamaica paid for their Dorset estate to be remodelled, including the diversion of local roads. A contemporary trunk road, it seems, can owe its course to the slave trade.</p> <p>John Andrews, a keen walker in Suffolk, is a veteran of more recent battles. He saw the original story and got in touch to tell us he has submitted more than 800 applications since 1973. \u201cWhen I first asked my local council for their definitive map, they didn\u2019t know what I was talking about.\u201d The map was eventually found, in an attic, and Andrews pored over it with a council officer. \u201cOur first discovery was that their new council building was built on a public footpath.\u201d</p> <p>The early years of Andrews\u2019s campaign were marred by bullying and violence. \u201cI was physically attacked several times by landowners.\u201d The old one-inch OS maps were not made for walkers and caused disputes. Fortunately, with the increasing popularity of walking and hiking, plus larger-scale maps, Andrews feels attitudes have changed. His advice to those submitting applications is simple. \u201cGo through the Ramblers, they will save you no end of time and effort. And collect strong evidence.\u201d</p> <p>For Cornish, the battle for our rights of way is about what kind of country we want to live in. \u201cMore paths means people are more likely to walk. Take away a useful cut-through in a town, for example, and someone might drive to work instead of walking. More paths mean a healthier and happier population.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0813d0da40b0e0b41420512ea397140674527f8a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0813d0da40b0e0b41420512ea397140674527f8a/0_440_4032_2584/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A rescued footpath in the Peak District.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"641\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A rescued footpath in the Peak District.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Don't Lose Your Way</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is an argument that seems to have resonated internationally. Cornish has been contacted by media from all around the world: German journalists were in touch to ask why their own country hadn\u2019t got a lost footpaths project. \u201cI couldn\u2019t really answer that!\u201d He spent 90 minutes on the phone explaining the significance of British footpaths to an American who went everywhere by car. Our footpath network, of course, is an object of curiosity and envy for visitors from countries who have no such thing. Recently, I was pleasantly surprised to see a group of Asian visitors on the Lyke Wake walk on the North Yorks Moors, even more surprised when I noticed they were pulling wheelie bags.</p> <p>Andrews now lives in Scotland, a country with a more positive attitude to rights of access, but his finest achievement in footpath salvation is back in Suffolk. \u201cI used documents from the early 19th century to prove a right of way along about eight miles of the Icknield Way.\u201d Passing over heathland and through woods, the path ran across the Guinness estate near Elveden. Andrews won the case. \u201cThat is an ancient path, I mean, the Romans improved it. Now it\u2019s on the definitive map.\u201d</p> <p>For everyone embarking on the challenge of rescuing a right of way, his message is clear: \u201cIt\u2019s so rewarding to see people walking a path that you rescued. Don\u2019t be put off by the legal process. Keep going!\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Sam Thompson is standing at the end of the footpath that he is helping to save. There is no sign, just a gate and a post adorned with a few strands of barbed wire. \u201cI started walking this route a few months ago. It connects to woods that otherwise I\u2019d have to walk through a housing estate to reach.\u201d We are in the York suburb of Acomb, a former village now swamped by sprawling post-second-world-war housing developments. To outsiders, it can seem like a maze of long bends and cul-de-sacs with extraordinary numbers of speed bumps. We climb the gate and start down a narrow path lined by tall grasses, soon dodging through a hedge to emerge in a wild meadow, beyond which lies a line of trees. The change from brick and asphalt to rural beauty is dramatic and totally unexpected. A few months ago, I wrote a story in these pages about the urgent need to identify and reclaim lost rights of way in Britain. After the story appeared, a member of the UK walking charity Ramblers posted handwritten notes through all the houses on Thompson\u2019s street alerting them to a local path under threat. It was a path that was used but its legal status was uncertain. Boots on the ground were needed. \u201cThis path has changed my perception of Acomb,\u201d Thompson says. \u201cThe fact that I can be in fields and woods so quickly: I\u2019m definitely happier and more at home now.\u201d He wrote to the Guardian to tell us about it, and he was one of many: we received tales of ongoing battles and those that had only just begun. Readers described finding fallen footpath signs and heading off through beds of nettles to identify local rights of way that had been forgotten. Others, working from maps, began to discover lost paths in their own neighbourhoods while a considerable number had been reminded of lost routes they had known as children. There were cases of schools putting up fences that blocked much-loved and well-used routes across playing fields. A huge range of issues were raised: changes in farming practices, austerity cuts to local government, access to coast and riverbanks, access to riverbanks when the river moves and ones pertaining to the law about paths that have been established by regular public usage (a footpath can be established as a right of way by regular use for 20 years if there has been no attempt to prevent access by the landowner). At the Ramblers, the Guardian reader response was deeply felt and appreciated. \u201cAround 4,000 copies of our practical guide to saving footpaths were downloaded,\u201d says Jack Cornish, the coordinator for the Don\u2019t Lose Your Way project. \u201cLots of people got in touch with personal stories. It was fantastic. Of course, the process takes time, but I\u2019m sure we\u2019re going to save hundreds of miles of previously unidentified rights of way.\u201d He is under no illusions about the significance. \u201cThe response highlights how much more is out there. There are large areas of the country from which we hear very little. Potentially, there are thousands more miles that could disappear without immediate action. We urgently need more people to get involved.\u201d The reason for the urgency is the UK government\u2019s decision to set 1 January 2026 as a deadline for applications to change definitive maps held by local councils. These maps are supposed to show every public right of way in existence, but in practice, they do not. When the maps were drawn up in 1949, the recording process was patchy and fairly arbitrary: some parishes faithfully set down all their paths, some managed a proportion, others did almost nothing. Some of the omissions are shocking: drovers\u2019 roads used for centuries suddenly truncated, key access ways to historic sites or coastal features vanished. One reader found a local walk that simply ended in the middle of a wood, an orphan caused by the boundary between Herefordshire and Shropshire. \u201cIt was great fun researching the history of the footpath and I learned a huge amount,\u201d he says. The application is now lodged, and despite the frustrating pace at which local authorities are examining each case, the application will stand, beyond the 2026 deadline if necessary. Near St Just in Cornwall, a Guardian reader discovered a vital path connecting to the south-west coastal route. \u201cIt was almost invisible due to high ferns growing all over, but it was possible to follow the traces. It is not a long stretch and could be cleared with a brush cutter.\u201d In Devon a group of locals, the Brentor Commons Association, identified a lost drover\u2019s path then got a grant from the Co-op Local Causes to fund restoration. Their centuries-old path, now named The Holloway, has become a popular local walk. In Leintwardine, Herefordshire, estate maps from 1780 helped Jonathan Hopkinson identify a lost way, possibly part of a Roman road. The application to change the definitive map is now under way and Hopkinson has identified two further paths that will help create a circular route. For Jack Cornish, a key discovery of the project has been the history behind every lost footpath. One right of way was rediscovered after an observant art-lover spotted an interesting aspect to a Gainsborough painting in Tate Britain. \u201cHe had worked out the spot where Gainsborough had painted the picture in 1747 and, from that, after checking old maps, had realised that the artist had been using a footpath, one subsequently lost.\u201d Stephen Whittle had a similar experience with an 1892 painting by Thomas Prytherch that showed an access lane down to the River Severn at Wroxeter, an ancient route and one Stephen had used as a child to go swimming, but which was now blocked by gates. Maps from the 19th century back up his claim. The battle for rights of way is certainly not a new one. Prof Eric Jones, an emeritus professor at Melbourne\u2019s La Trobe University and the author of Landed Estates and Rural Inequality in English History, has found many examples of losses going back to the 17th century. \u201cThe appropriation of rights of way,\u201d he writes, \u201cis a perpetual but surprisingly overlooked aspect of England\u2019s much-studied landscape.\u201d Preferences for privacy and fine views led landowners to demolish villages and reroute, or simply obliterate, roads and paths. Jones points to a typical case in Methley, West Yorkshire, when, in 1627, Sir Henry Savile built a new park and refused to countenance \u201ca common road way\u201d through it. The right of way simply disappeared. At some point, all of us have probably wondered why the routes of certain roads can be so capricious, suddenly darting around an apparently unnecessary right angle. The answer is often in the past. The A350 between Shaftesbury and Blandford Forum, for example, does a big loop to avoid a certain fish pond, the property in the 17th century of the Beckford family, whose sugar plantations in Jamaica paid for their Dorset estate to be remodelled, including the diversion of local roads. A contemporary trunk road, it seems, can owe its course to the slave trade. John Andrews, a keen walker in Suffolk, is a veteran of more recent battles. He saw the original story and got in touch to tell us he has submitted more than 800 applications since 1973. \u201cWhen I first asked my local council for their definitive map, they didn\u2019t know what I was talking about.\u201d The map was eventually found, in an attic, and Andrews pored over it with a council officer. \u201cOur first discovery was that their new council building was built on a public footpath.\u201d The early years of Andrews\u2019s campaign were marred by bullying and violence. \u201cI was physically attacked several times by landowners.\u201d The old one-inch OS maps were not made for walkers and caused disputes. Fortunately, with the increasing popularity of walking and hiking, plus larger-scale maps, Andrews feels attitudes have changed. His advice to those submitting applications is simple. \u201cGo through the Ramblers, they will save you no end of time and effort. And collect strong evidence.\u201d For Cornish, the battle for our rights of way is about what kind of country we want to live in. \u201cMore paths means people are more likely to walk. Take away a useful cut-through in a town, for example, and someone might drive to work instead of walking. More paths mean a healthier and happier population.\u201d It is an argument that seems to have resonated internationally. Cornish has been contacted by media from all around the world: German journalists were in touch to ask why their own country hadn\u2019t got a lost footpaths project. \u201cI couldn\u2019t really answer that!\u201d He spent 90 minutes on the phone explaining the significance of British footpaths to an American who went everywhere by car. Our footpath network, of course, is an object of curiosity and envy for visitors from countries who have no such thing. Recently, I was pleasantly surprised to see a group of Asian visitors on the Lyke Wake walk on the North Yorks Moors, even more surprised when I noticed they were pulling wheelie bags. Andrews now lives in Scotland, a country with a more positive attitude to rights of access, but his finest achievement in footpath salvation is back in Suffolk. \u201cI used documents from the early 19th century to prove a right of way along about eight miles of the Icknield Way.\u201d Passing over heathland and through woods, the path ran across the Guinness estate near Elveden. Andrews won the case. \u201cThat is an ancient path, I mean, the Romans improved it. Now it\u2019s on the definitive map.\u201d For everyone embarking on the challenge of rescuing a right of way, his message is clear: \u201cIt\u2019s so rewarding to see people walking a path that you rescued. Don\u2019t be put off by the legal process. Keep going!\u201d",

It has happened, Dean, and we had a few readers emailing in with the same example. James Morrison fired his answer in first, so here it is: \u201cI\u2019m sure a few will remember this incident of two yellow cards in one move resulting in a red. In a Euros qualifier between Northern Ireland and Hungary from September 2015, the former Fulham defender Chris Baird brought down a Hungary player who was nowhere near the ball during a break, then sprinted down the pitch to scythe down another attacker, thereby completing the dubious feat of committing two yellow-card offences in just seven seconds. Champions League perennial C\u00fcneyt \u00c7akir duly obliged and showed two yellows and a red to a bemused looking Baird, who presumably thought the first foul gave him immunity for the second. Here is a video of the incident. Goalkeepers scoring on their debuts (2) Last week, we delved into the subject of goalscoring goalies \u2026 on their debuts. But there are more \u2026 Thanks to the Betamax Video Club for resurfacing this from 2016, when on-loan FC Lahti keeper Aleksandr Vasyutin popped up in the 92nd minute against PK-35 to grab an equaliser. \u201cThe pass was made, I ran towards the goal, kept an eye on the trajectory of the ball, jumped, felt that I was the first to make it and when I landed I saw that the ball was in the goal,\u201d explained Vasyutin. \u201cI didn\u2019t even understand what had happened at first. And then all of a sudden, congratulations. It felt very nice.\u201d And Christopher Chan also piped up, with an even more spectacular debut strike. \u201cI am appalled no one answered that Hong Kong goalkeeper Man-fai Tsang scored on his professional debut (and had an assist too),\u201d he tweets. Here it is in all its glory, the Fourway Rangers player embarrassing his TSW Pegasus opposite number in 2011. What\u2019s more, it was his only first-team appearance before being loaned out and then leaving. Knowledge archive \u201cIs it true that Albania once barred Celtic defender Danny McGrain from entering the country because he had a beard?\u201d wondered Andrew Oxley in 2007. Very nearly, is the answer, as communist Albania frowned at all facial hair under its leader Enver Hoxha, who had made beards illegal before Celtic were due to travel for their 1979 European Cup first-round first leg tie against Partizan Tirana. The owner of a fine-follicled face-hugger himself, McGrain was understandably anxious before the trip, recalling that \u201cthere was a lot in the press about beards being banned there\u201d. As it transpired, no one told McGrain to shave it off and he went on to play in a 1-0 defeat. \u201cI would have done it if they had asked, but I had actually seen a few people with them,\u201d added the Celtic legend, whose side subsequently ran out 4-1 winners in the return game. \u201cIt was a little intimidating too because when we went outside there were only men in the streets and no women to be seen, but there was no bother at all.\u201d McGrain went on to win 62 caps for Scotland, before moving into management at Arbroath, where his fancy chin-warmer came to prominence again. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget how the fans took to Danny McGrain and his beard,\u201d recalled then-chairman John Christison of the so-called \u2018Danny McGrain\u2019s Bearded Army\u2019. \u201cIt was crazy \u2013 but brilliant. They would all wear their own beards and we had 700 T-shirts printed up. They sold out in three days.\u201d For more from the Knowledge archive, click this thing here. Can you help? \u201cKei Kamara started Colorado Rapids\u2019 MLS match against Montreal by scoring an own goal,\u201d begins Jason Maxwell. \u201cHe then turned around and scored a hat-trick to make up for it. I\u2019m guessing this isn\u2019t the first time its happened but I assume it\u2019s rare. What\u2019s the highest goals-plus-own-goals total for a player in a match?\u201d \u201cWhat is the highest tier of men\u2019s football in which a woman has played?\u201d asks Alexander Ediassen. \u201cBefore what is expected to be the most exciting and competitive season in the Cymru Premier (formerly Welsh Premier League), I ask if any other country\u2019s top tier has had three-quarters of its team starting with the first three letters of the alphabet (or indeed any three consecutive letters or even any three letters)?\u201d writes Matthew Ahern.

      "body": "<p>Copycat terrorism is on the rise again, this time from the far right.</p> <p>Over the past few months, we have witnessed a series of lethal terrorist attacks against minorities in places of worship and other public spaces that are said to have been carried out by white supremacists. There was the shooting at a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/oct/27/pittsburgh-synagogue-shooting\" title=\"\">Pittsburgh synagogue in October 2018</a>, then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/25/prince-william-receives-traditional-maori-greeting-in-new-zealand\" title=\"\">two mosque attacks in New Zealand in March 2019</a>, another <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/apr/28/john-earnest-san-diego-shooting-suspect-posted-open-letter-online\" title=\"\">synagogue assault in California</a> a month later and an attack at a Walmart store in El Paso, Texas, on Saturday.</p> <p>While the victims of these attacks were diverse \u2013 from young children to army veterans and mothers of newborn babies \u2013 their alleged perpetrators had much in common: radicalised white men who frequented online far-right hotbeds such as the anonymous imageboard website 8chan and the alt-right Twitter equivalent, Gab. And they believed their race to be threatened by an imminent \u201cinvasion\u201d or gradual \u201cpopulation replacement\u201d.</p> <p>In the summer of 2016, one Isis-inspired lone-actor attack was followed by the next: first a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/15/nice-attack-leaves-84-dead-and-france-in-shock\" title=\"\">truck attack in Nice</a>, then several knife attacks and a bombing in Germany, followed by a hostage-taking at a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/26/men-hostages-french-church-police-normandy-saint-etienne-du-rouvray\" title=\"\">church in Normandy</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>After the emergence of Isis, it did not take long until early warning systems were introduced on a global scale</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The ideology driving today\u2019s wave of far-right emulation attacks is, of course, different in nature, but the underlying contagion effect is similar. The spike in jihadi attacks in 2016 came after Isis spokesman Abu Muhammed al-Adnani <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/isis-official-calls-for-lone-wolf-attacks-in-us-and-europe-during-ramadan-a7042296.html\" title=\"\">repeated his call</a> for lone-wolf attacks against western targets in a recording that quickly spread across online channels.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/christchurch-shooting\" title=\"\">Christchurch shooting</a> suspect is said to have encouraged his audience on 8chan to follow his example. \u201cI only wish to inspire others,\u201d the suspect in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/apr/27/san-diego-police-shooting-synagogue-poway-reports\" title=\"\">Poway synagogue shooting</a> in California announced in a similar tone in the document he left behind on the same platform. Shortly before the El Paso attack occurred, a post calling for racial separation and denouncing the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/05/el-paso-shooting-suspect-trump-language-manifesto\" title=\"\">\u201cHispanic invasion of Texas\u201d </a>appeared on 8chan.</p> <p>The deadly El Paso attack would be at least the third time in 2019 that 8chan has been accused of acting as a radicalisation engine. Like the Isis attackers, the white supremacist shooters are part of toxic extremist subcultures rather than socially isolated, disturbed individuals.</p> <p>But politicians and security forces have systematically underestimated the risks emerging from inherently violent far-right ideologies. After taking office in 2017, President Trump even cut the funds for anti-racist organisations and far-right extremism prevention programmes. </p> <p>Terrorism is a means, not an end. Its strategy is based on generating attention, inflaming tensions and escalating conflicts. Whether Isis suicide bombings or white supremacist shootings, the shared goal of such acts is usually to spark a war of races, religions or cultures. The alleged Christchurch attacker wrote that he wanted \u201cto add momentum to the pendulum swings of history, further destabilising and polarising western society\u201d. Similar to his jihadi counterparts, he denounced the \u201cnihilistic, hedonistic, individualistic insanity\u201d in contemporary western society.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f6f5955d0d4daa0bac184156f43d126ac9638463\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f6f5955d0d4daa0bac184156f43d126ac9638463/0_0_5030_3353/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mourners lay flowers, following an attack on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, in March\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mourners lay flowers following an attack on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, in March.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vincent Thian/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These parallels mean that we neeed to apply what we know about martyrdom operations from previous waves of terrorism. First and foremost, we need to tackle the underlying ideology and its online spread. With Trump and some European politicians echoing the language of the 8chan community and using words such as \u201cinvaders\u201d to describe immigrants, it will be challenging to reverse the emboldening of the violent far right and the normalisation of their rhetoric.</p> <p>Our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/07/christchurch-mosque-killer-ideas-mainstream-social-media\" title=\"\">latest report at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue</a> revealed that 8chan and similar sites served as a central hub for the wider dissemination of propaganda related to the so-called great replacement theory. Following slick online operations coordinated by far-right activists on fringe platforms, these conspiracy theories have increasingly entered mainstream discussions on social media. The number of tweets mentioning the theory nearly tripled in four years from just over 120,000 in 2014 to just over 330,000 in 2018.</p> <p>Despite recent changes in the removal policies of bigger platforms like Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, which now cover white separatist and white nationalist content, there remain vast numbers of websites that are willing to host far-right extremist accounts. Many racist and violence-endorsing pages continue to be operative across the less known alt-tech platforms: from extremist in-house creations to ultra-libertarian social media sites and encrypted messaging apps. In such far-right safe havens, it does not take a user long to come across posts that explicitly incite crimes against Muslims, Jews, black people, Hispanics and leftwing politicians, or step-by-step instructions on how to build weapons at home.</p> <p>Despite a decrease in the number of Islamist extremist attacks across Europe and North America in the last two years and, at the same time, a large increase in the number of far-right-inspired terror attacks, the response provided by the international security community is inadequate.

      "bodyText": "Copycat terrorism is on the rise again, this time from the far right. Over the past few months, we have witnessed a series of lethal terrorist attacks against minorities in places of worship and other public spaces that are said to have been carried out by white supremacists. There was the shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue in October 2018, then two mosque attacks in New Zealand in March 2019, another synagogue assault in California a month later and an attack at a Walmart store in El Paso, Texas, on Saturday. While the victims of these attacks were diverse \u2013 from young children to army veterans and mothers of newborn babies \u2013 their alleged perpetrators had much in common: radicalised white men who frequented online far-right hotbeds such as the anonymous imageboard website 8chan and the alt-right Twitter equivalent, Gab. And they believed their race to be threatened by an imminent \u201cinvasion\u201d or gradual \u201cpopulation replacement\u201d. In the summer of 2016, one Isis-inspired lone-actor attack was followed by the next: first a truck attack in Nice, then several knife attacks and a bombing in Germany, followed by a hostage-taking at a church in Normandy. The ideology driving today\u2019s wave of far-right emulation attacks is, of course, different in nature, but the underlying contagion effect is similar. The spike in jihadi attacks in 2016 came after Isis spokesman Abu Muhammed al-Adnani repeated his call for lone-wolf attacks against western targets in a recording that quickly spread across online channels. The Christchurch shooting suspect is said to have encouraged his audience on 8chan to follow his example. \u201cI only wish to inspire others,\u201d the suspect in the Poway synagogue shooting in California announced in a similar tone in the document he left behind on the same platform. Shortly before the El Paso attack occurred, a post calling for racial separation and denouncing the \u201cHispanic invasion of Texas\u201d appeared on 8chan. The deadly El Paso attack would be at least the third time in 2019 that 8chan has been accused of acting as a radicalisation engine. Like the Isis attackers, the white supremacist shooters are part of toxic extremist subcultures rather than socially isolated, disturbed individuals. But politicians and security forces have systematically underestimated the risks emerging from inherently violent far-right ideologies. After taking office in 2017, President Trump even cut the funds for anti-racist organisations and far-right extremism prevention programmes. Terrorism is a means, not an end. Its strategy is based on generating attention, inflaming tensions and escalating conflicts. Whether Isis suicide bombings or white supremacist shootings, the shared goal of such acts is usually to spark a war of races, religions or cultures. The alleged Christchurch attacker wrote that he wanted \u201cto add momentum to the pendulum swings of history, further destabilising and polarising western society\u201d. Similar to his jihadi counterparts, he denounced the \u201cnihilistic, hedonistic, individualistic insanity\u201d in contemporary western society. These parallels mean that we neeed to apply what we know about martyrdom operations from previous waves of terrorism. First and foremost, we need to tackle the underlying ideology and its online spread. With Trump and some European politicians echoing the language of the 8chan community and using words such as \u201cinvaders\u201d to describe immigrants, it will be challenging to reverse the emboldening of the violent far right and the normalisation of their rhetoric. Our latest report at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue revealed that 8chan and similar sites served as a central hub for the wider dissemination of propaganda related to the so-called great replacement theory. Following slick online operations coordinated by far-right activists on fringe platforms, these conspiracy theories have increasingly entered mainstream discussions on social media. The number of tweets mentioning the theory nearly tripled in four years from just over 120,000 in 2014 to just over 330,000 in 2018. Despite recent changes in the removal policies of bigger platforms like Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, which now cover white separatist and white nationalist content, there remain vast numbers of websites that are willing to host far-right extremist accounts. Many racist and violence-endorsing pages continue to be operative across the less known alt-tech platforms: from extremist in-house creations to ultra-libertarian social media sites and encrypted messaging apps. In such far-right safe havens, it does not take a user long to come across posts that explicitly incite crimes against Muslims, Jews, black people, Hispanics and leftwing politicians, or step-by-step instructions on how to build weapons at home. Despite a decrease in the number of Islamist extremist attacks across Europe and North America in the last two years and, at the same time, a large increase in the number of far-right-inspired terror attacks, the response provided by the international security community is inadequate. After the emergence of Isis, it did not take long until early warning systems were introduced on a global scale. Removal mechanisms were faster, ample resources were provided and international cooperation was more determined. There is a database that facilitates the removal of extremist photo and video content across tech platforms, but it focuses almost exclusively on al-Qaida and Isis-related propaganda. If we want to protect our communities from more atrocities, we need our governments to step up their efforts for an internationally coordinated response to the online spread of white supremacist propaganda. A first step would be to agree on an international definition of terrorism that is ideologically agnostic and includes not only traditional jihadi organisations but also loose far-right networks. Second, governments will need to look beyond the big tech platforms and introduce legal frameworks that tackle the ongoing migration of extremists to the smaller alt-tech sites. And, finally, we need a stronger international response to condemn political rhetoric that belittles, legitimises or even endorses the dangerous concepts and conspiracy theories of far-right extremists. If we fail to do so, they will continue to destroy innocent lives as well as the fabric that holds together our democratic societies. \u2022 Julia Ebner is a researcher at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, and author of The Rage: The Vicious Circle of Islamist and Far-Right Extremism",

      "bodyText": "The Australian Israel Jewish Affairs Council has called on Israel\u2019s deputy health minister to step down after police recommended he face indictment for allegedly interfering in the extradition case of Malka Leifer. Yaakov Litzman is accused of pressuring psychiatrists to alter the conclusions of their reports about the former Melbourne school principal so a court would find her mentally unfit to stand trial over child sexual abuse charges, the Times of Israel reported. Leifer was the head of Melbourne\u2019s ultra-orthodox Adass Israel school and faces 74 charges of sexual assault of female students. She returned to Israel in 2008 after the sexual offence allegations emerged. The Israeli police say they have enough evidence for an indictment of Litzman for tampering with witnesses. \u201cWith the end of this investigation the Israeli police\u2019s position is that there is enough alleged evidence against deputy minister of health Yaakov Litzman of offences of fraud, breach of trust, and impeachment in testimony in the [Leifer] extradition case,\u201d the statement said. The investigation allegedly found that psychiatrists feared they would be fired if they did not follow the orders of Litzman, who is also chairman of the ultra-Orthodox United Torah Judaism party. The executive director of the Australian Israel Jewish Affairs Council, Colin Rubenstein, said: \u201cAIJAC welcomes this latest development and trusts it will lead to Leifer\u2019s swift extradition back to Australia to face justice.\u201d In February, Israeli police opened an investigation into whether Litzman had obstructed the trial. Litzman is a member of the same religious denomination as Leifer and leads a Jewish ultra-Orthodox party. Litzman\u2019s office denied any wrongdoing and said he had worked \u201cin favour of the citizens of Israel in total transparency and according to the law\u201d. \u201cWe are sure without a doubt that after a close examination it will be revealed that his actions were flawless,\u201d the statement said. Israel\u2019s attorney general will make the decision on whether to indict Litzman. Leifer\u2019s case, which has gone through more than 50 hearings, is still being considered by a Jerusalem court.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson\u2019s most senior adviser, Dominic Cummings, has laid down a challenge to the Conservative rebel Dominic Grieve, suggesting that parliament would not find a way of forcing out the prime minister to stop a no-deal Brexit. Grieve, a former attorney general, has said it would be unconstitutional for Johnson to defy any vote of no confidence and remain in Downing Street until after the Brexit deadline of 31 October. Cummings, the former campaign director of Vote Leave, is understood to have told government advisers last week that Johnson could stay on as prime minister even if rebel Tory MPs were able to form a \u201cgovernment of national unity\u201d opposed to a no-deal Brexit. The plan would be to form such an alternative government in the 14 days after the government lost a vote of no confidence. The Fixed-term Parliaments Act gives 14 days for such a government to be established before an automatic general election is called. Cummings is said to have told advisers that Johnson would ignore the result of the confidence vote and call a \u201cpeople v politicians\u201d general election \u2013 to be held after Britain had left the EU. Speaking to the Times, Grieve said the Queen would have a responsibility to act in those circumstances. \u201cThe Queen is not a decorative extra,\u201d Grieve said. \u201cIt\u2019s true she has sought to keep herself well away from the cut and thrust of politics, but at the end of the day there are residual powers and responsibilities which lie with her. She might have to dispense with his services herself.\u201d Speaking as he left his home on Wednesday morning, Cummings hinted that the next few weeks would see which man was right about what would unfold. \u201cThe most simple thing is the prime minister believes that politicians don\u2019t get to choose which votes they respect, that\u2019s the critical issue,\u201d he told Sky News. \u201cI don\u2019t think I am arrogant. I don\u2019t know very much about very much. Mr Grieve \u2026 we\u2019ll see what he\u2019s right about.\u201d Experts have cautioned that the prime minister would still remain in control of the timetable even if the government lost a confidence vote.

If they do not it is hard for a new government to be formed without dragging the Queen into politics.\u201d Jonathan Sumption, a former supreme court judge, said Johnson would be entitled to stay on as prime minister even if he lost a confidence vote. In those circumstances, the prime minister would have the power to set the date of the election for after 31 October, following the UK\u2019s departure from the EU with or without a deal. Speculation intensified that Johnson was preparing for a snap poll after it emerged he had brought in Isaac Levido, the righthand man of the Australian election guru Lynton Crosby, to a new campaigning role at Conservative party headquarters.",

      "body": "<p>Even in the deeply cynical world of pro football, the NFL\u2019s latest plot to expand to an 18-game schedule rings as a blatant cash grab at the expense of its fans, broadcast partners and the health of its players.</p> <p>The recent proposal is as brazen as it is foolish. In short: the league has pitched an idea to host an 18-game season but limit the number of individual games each player can play to 16. Yes. You read that right. The league wants to hold a competitive, multi-billion-dollar competition that would see its best, most marketable players miss 12% of the season.</p> <p>When ego and greed collide, this is the kind of nonsense you get. The wackadoodle idea stems from the league\u2019s commissioner, Roger Goodell, representing the NFL\u2019s 32 owners. When Goodell announced to the world that<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-28/nfl-bullish-about-25-billion-revenue-goal-as-super-bowl-nears\"> he expected</a> the NFL\u2019s revenue to balloon past $25bn by 2027, he was banking on the league\u2019s schedule expanding.</p> <p>This, of course, rings as a negotiation ploy. It is collective bargaining season. As things stand, the current deal between the NFL\u2019s owners and the NFL Players Association is set to expire after the 2020 schedule.</p> <p>It is in everyone\u2019s interest that a deal is concluded swiftly, as league revenue continues to rise. But things will get testy. TV deals are about to expire. Amazon and Facebook will become bidders for full, international rights. Both have geared up for an arms race as they look to steal the most valuable sports property in America away from the traditional networks and cable providers.</p> <p>Legalized gambling is on the way, too. The owners want an ironclad agreement in place ASAP so they can make further riches. Yet they refuse to offer fully guaranteed contracts to players, curtail the<a href=\"https://www.espn.com/video/clip/_/id/14976260\"> disciplinary power of the commissioner</a>, or invest in a long-term medical/pension plan that could help <em>every</em> player in their post-playing life. We know now more than ever (and we learn more every day) about the dangers of playing football. Yet the league is content to issue its one-time payment to former players \u2013 which could cost more than $1bn \u2013 for <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/05/nfls-concussion-cover-up/484016/\">covering up information related to concussion research</a> and football\u2019s impact on Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE).</p> <p>What the league currently offers is so mangled in red tape that it is essentially pointless. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/04/sports/football/nfl-concussion-settlement-player-registration.html\">The New York Times reports</a> that only $1m has been paid out so far to former players and countless NFL veterans have been shut out of the deal. And that\u2019s how the league likes it.</p> <p>They will, however, have to offer some concessions in the next collective bargaining agreement with players. And so we return to that wonderfully absurd proposal. The subtext to Goodell\u2019s pitch is this: let\u2019s grab the money and benefits of the 18-game schedule while feigning interest in the health of our players by limiting them to the current battery of 16 games. Doesn\u2019t everybody win?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/apr/19/harry-kane-spurs-nfl-kicker\">'The guys I\u2019ve tried failed miserably': could Harry Kane really make the NFL?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s not going to wash. You can\u2019t have integrity in a sports contest that actively takes star players such as Aaron Rodgers, Tom Brady and Patrick Mahomes off the field for a significant part of the season.</p> <p>From a marketing standpoint, you could probably cope without other position groups for two games apiece. Even the likes of Aaron Donald, JJ Watt, and Trent Williams, for as much as they impact results and aesthetics, could take a two-game rest without affecting ratings. Take the top quarterbacks off the field, though, and force a national TV audience to sit through a <a href=\"https://www.sbnation.com/2017/11/19/16667566/2017-worst-nfl-quarterback-matchups-ranked-tom-savage-blaine-gabbert\">Tom Savage v Blaine Gabbert matchup</a>, and confidence in the league and the ratings that go with it will divebomb. Whether the TV partner is NBC or Facebook, they won\u2019t be happy.</p> <p>The NFLPA has consistently pushed back against an expanded schedule. Sure, it would mean more roster spots, but it would also devalue the contracts of those players already in the league. Overall earnings would boom, but the percentage going to each player would fall. It\u2019s easier to divide the big pie 32 ways as owners than it is for potentially 2,400 players \u2013 if rosters, as projected, were to expand to 75 players per team. Even with the extra bye-week on offer, it\u2019s not worth it to the top players who move the needle when it comes to collective bargaining.</p> <p>The league isn\u2019t dumb enough to <em>really</em> believe in this idea. Or is it? After all, this is the league that played a quarter of its season with unqualified, high school referees, rather than <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/monteburke/2012/09/17/the-nfls-replacement-ref-disaster/#b401716300e7\">pay its semi-professional refs a realistic salary</a>. And these are also the marketing whizzes who came up with the creative plan of branding one of the most marketable stars in all of sports, Tom Brady, as a cheat, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/04/sports/football/tom-brady-suspension-deflategate.html\">without sufficient evidence</a>.</p> <p>The NBA is continually looking at legislation that gets its star players onto the court. The likes of Kawhi Leonard, the reigning finals MVP, have taken to playing 70 of the league\u2019s 82 regular-season games, citing \u201cload management\u201d as they prepare themselves to be in the best shape possible for the postseason. The NBA knows the cost this has on its relationship with its fans and broadcast partners. Talks to reduce the number of games or levy fines have escalated. The NFL\u2019s plan is to go the other way. It wants to <em>limit </em>the amount fans can see stars. Instead, you will have to deal with two weeks of wincing as your backup left tackle spends a couple of games protecting a shoddy quarterback.</p> <p>That\u2019s the other thing: coaches are too smart. They will remove everybody at once. Either they play their full first offense and second defense one week before flip-flopping the next time around, or they\u2019ll pull both first teams at once. Leaving starters in to play with duds while the star players get rest would be vilified as coaching malpractice, particularly if one, inevitably, sustains an injury. Aesthetically, it will look like a preseason game. Financially, the owners will make regular season cash.</p> <p>Goodell\u2019s premiership has been a clown show. There have been serious errors. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/11/ray-rice-roger-goodell-mistake-cover-up-nfl-video\">His bundling of the Ray Rice case</a> showcased his hubris on a level that is rare even in the gladiatorial world of sports. Domestic violence is an issue the legal system can\u2019t handle properly. Yet somehow this meat shield for 32 rich sports owners thought he could do the job?</p> <p>We\u2019ve had <a href=\"https://www.elitedaily.com/p/what-was-deflategate-a-refresher-of-the-patriots-greatest-controversy-8091290\">Deflategate</a>.

We\u2019ve had ad hoc rule changes that move with the wind of the moment, not with a long-term vision of what the league should look like in 10, 20, 30 years. Only under Goodell could something as simple as a catch <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/sports/wp/2018/03/27/whats-a-catch-nfl-now-knows-as-owners-unanimously-approve-new-catch-rule/\">become an impossible-to-define term</a>.</p> <p>We don\u2019t have time to list <a href=\"https://www.gq.com/story/roger-goodell-nfl-25-dumbest-moments\">all the blunders of the Goodell era</a>. But this misstep serves as the perfect microcosm. For the NFL, the bottom line is all that matters. Damn the players, fans, coaches, broadcast partners and anyone else who tries to get in the way of the ever-increasing pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Even in the deeply cynical world of pro football, the NFL\u2019s latest plot to expand to an 18-game schedule rings as a blatant cash grab at the expense of its fans, broadcast partners and the health of its players. The recent proposal is as brazen as it is foolish. In short: the league has pitched an idea to host an 18-game season but limit the number of individual games each player can play to 16. Yes. You read that right. The league wants to hold a competitive, multi-billion-dollar competition that would see its best, most marketable players miss 12% of the season. When ego and greed collide, this is the kind of nonsense you get. The wackadoodle idea stems from the league\u2019s commissioner, Roger Goodell, representing the NFL\u2019s 32 owners. When Goodell announced to the world that he expected the NFL\u2019s revenue to balloon past $25bn by 2027, he was banking on the league\u2019s schedule expanding. This, of course, rings as a negotiation ploy. It is collective bargaining season. As things stand, the current deal between the NFL\u2019s owners and the NFL Players Association is set to expire after the 2020 schedule. It is in everyone\u2019s interest that a deal is concluded swiftly, as league revenue continues to rise. But things will get testy. TV deals are about to expire. Amazon and Facebook will become bidders for full, international rights. Both have geared up for an arms race as they look to steal the most valuable sports property in America away from the traditional networks and cable providers. Legalized gambling is on the way, too. The owners want an ironclad agreement in place ASAP so they can make further riches. Yet they refuse to offer fully guaranteed contracts to players, curtail the disciplinary power of the commissioner, or invest in a long-term medical/pension plan that could help every player in their post-playing life. We know now more than ever (and we learn more every day) about the dangers of playing football. Yet the league is content to issue its one-time payment to former players \u2013 which could cost more than $1bn \u2013 for covering up information related to concussion research and football\u2019s impact on Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE). What the league currently offers is so mangled in red tape that it is essentially pointless. The New York Times reports that only $1m has been paid out so far to former players and countless NFL veterans have been shut out of the deal. And that\u2019s how the league likes it. They will, however, have to offer some concessions in the next collective bargaining agreement with players. And so we return to that wonderfully absurd proposal. The subtext to Goodell\u2019s pitch is this: let\u2019s grab the money and benefits of the 18-game schedule while feigning interest in the health of our players by limiting them to the current battery of 16 games. Doesn\u2019t everybody win? It\u2019s not going to wash. You can\u2019t have integrity in a sports contest that actively takes star players such as Aaron Rodgers, Tom Brady and Patrick Mahomes off the field for a significant part of the season. From a marketing standpoint, you could probably cope without other position groups for two games apiece. Even the likes of Aaron Donald, JJ Watt, and Trent Williams, for as much as they impact results and aesthetics, could take a two-game rest without affecting ratings. Take the top quarterbacks off the field, though, and force a national TV audience to sit through a Tom Savage v Blaine Gabbert matchup, and confidence in the league and the ratings that go with it will divebomb. Whether the TV partner is NBC or Facebook, they won\u2019t be happy. The NFLPA has consistently pushed back against an expanded schedule. Sure, it would mean more roster spots, but it would also devalue the contracts of those players already in the league. Overall earnings would boom, but the percentage going to each player would fall. It\u2019s easier to divide the big pie 32 ways as owners than it is for potentially 2,400 players \u2013 if rosters, as projected, were to expand to 75 players per team. Even with the extra bye-week on offer, it\u2019s not worth it to the top players who move the needle when it comes to collective bargaining. The league isn\u2019t dumb enough to really believe in this idea. Or is it? After all, this is the league that played a quarter of its season with unqualified, high school referees, rather than pay its semi-professional refs a realistic salary. And these are also the marketing whizzes who came up with the creative plan of branding one of the most marketable stars in all of sports, Tom Brady, as a cheat, without sufficient evidence. The NBA is continually looking at legislation that gets its star players onto the court. The likes of Kawhi Leonard, the reigning finals MVP, have taken to playing 70 of the league\u2019s 82 regular-season games, citing \u201cload management\u201d as they prepare themselves to be in the best shape possible for the postseason. The NBA knows the cost this has on its relationship with its fans and broadcast partners. Talks to reduce the number of games or levy fines have escalated. The NFL\u2019s plan is to go the other way. It wants to limit the amount fans can see stars. Instead, you will have to deal with two weeks of wincing as your backup left tackle spends a couple of games protecting a shoddy quarterback. That\u2019s the other thing: coaches are too smart. They will remove everybody at once. Either they play their full first offense and second defense one week before flip-flopping the next time around, or they\u2019ll pull both first teams at once. Leaving starters in to play with duds while the star players get rest would be vilified as coaching malpractice, particularly if one, inevitably, sustains an injury. Aesthetically, it will look like a preseason game. Financially, the owners will make regular season cash. Goodell\u2019s premiership has been a clown show. There have been serious errors. His bundling of the Ray Rice case showcased his hubris on a level that is rare even in the gladiatorial world of sports. Domestic violence is an issue the legal system can\u2019t handle properly. Yet somehow this meat shield for 32 rich sports owners thought he could do the job? We\u2019ve had Deflategate. We\u2019ve had Bountygate. We\u2019ve had Bullygate. We\u2019ve had ad hoc rule changes that move with the wind of the moment, not with a long-term vision of what the league should look like in 10, 20, 30 years. Only under Goodell could something as simple as a catch become an impossible-to-define term. We don\u2019t have time to list all the blunders of the Goodell era. But this misstep serves as the perfect microcosm. For the NFL, the bottom line is all that matters. Damn the players, fans, coaches, broadcast partners and anyone else who tries to get in the way of the ever-increasing pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.",

      "body": "<p>Alejandro Bedoya was at home in the French city of Nantes in the fall of 2015, tuned to Germany\u2019s friendly at the Stade de France against Les Bleus. Like much of the viewing public, he knew something was amiss in the first half, when the broadcast picked up loud noises emanating from outside the stadium. They would later be revealed as suicide bomb explosions, one by a terrorist who had tried to infiltrate the stadium itself.</p> \n<p>For an athlete long engaged in off-field matters, the targeting of a sporting event for terror in the 13 November attacks marked a bitter awakening. Bedoya had rarely heeded the call to \u201cstick to sports,\u201d and when life-or-death issues encroached, the notion that he should limit himself to the game alone was fully bunk.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/04/alejandro-bedoya-mass-shootings-guns-mls-comments-philadelphia-union\">Alejandro Bedoya calls out Congress during MLS game over mass shootings</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s when as a football player, as an athlete, they\u2019re using a stadium, a place of entertainment, to attack our freedoms. So of course you think about that,\u201d Bedoya told the Guardian this week. \u201cYou\u2019re stuck in a locker room and something goes off, or you\u2019re on the field and somebody can, if they can get into the stadium with the types of guns and ammunition and magazines these guys have and fire away, you\u2019re on the field, an open target. Of course these things cross our minds.\u201d</p> \n<p>The attacks in Paris are one of the myriad influences that provide context for Bedoya making headlines Sunday. The captain of MLS\u2019s Philadelphia Union, Bedoya scored in the third minute of a nationally televised game against DC United. After celebrating with teammates, he found a broadcast microphone and shouted a message to a nation rocked by two mass shootings that weekend: \u201cHey Congress, do something now. End gun violence. Let\u2019s go!\u201d</p> \n<p>His words rocketed around the internet, the video garnering millions of views. The reaction surprised no one more than Bedoya, who found out from an Audi Field security guard at halftime that his moment had gone viral.</p> \n<p>In the hours before the game, Bedoya <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AleBedoya17/status/1158032906578735105\">had tweeted about the mass shootings</a> in El Paso and Dayton that had claimed a combined total of more than 30 lives. He\u2019d talked about them with family, including a group chat with friends who, half-jokingly, challenged Bedoya to use his visibility to get his voice out there. As he went through his usual pre-match routine, the tragedies remained in his thoughts.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe fact that I scored an early goal, third minute, I\u2019m guessing everything was fresh in my mind,\u201d Bedoya said. \u201cSo maybe it was a sign from God or something that, hey, you have a platform, speak out. I don\u2019t know. It just happened.\u201d</p> \n<p>Bedoya isn\u2019t new to the issue. His wife, Beatrice, is Norwegian, a country rocked by a mass shooting in 2011 that caused profound changes in its approach to gun violence. Bedoya grew up in Weston, Florida, 20 miles from Parkland, site of a mass shooting at Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School in 2018.

      "bodyText": "Alejandro Bedoya was at home in the French city of Nantes in the fall of 2015, tuned to Germany\u2019s friendly at the Stade de France against Les Bleus. Like much of the viewing public, he knew something was amiss in the first half, when the broadcast picked up loud noises emanating from outside the stadium. They would later be revealed as suicide bomb explosions, one by a terrorist who had tried to infiltrate the stadium itself. For an athlete long engaged in off-field matters, the targeting of a sporting event for terror in the 13 November attacks marked a bitter awakening. Bedoya had rarely heeded the call to \u201cstick to sports,\u201d and when life-or-death issues encroached, the notion that he should limit himself to the game alone was fully bunk. \u201cThat\u2019s when as a football player, as an athlete, they\u2019re using a stadium, a place of entertainment, to attack our freedoms. So of course you think about that,\u201d Bedoya told the Guardian this week. \u201cYou\u2019re stuck in a locker room and something goes off, or you\u2019re on the field and somebody can, if they can get into the stadium with the types of guns and ammunition and magazines these guys have and fire away, you\u2019re on the field, an open target. Of course these things cross our minds.\u201d The attacks in Paris are one of the myriad influences that provide context for Bedoya making headlines Sunday. The captain of MLS\u2019s Philadelphia Union, Bedoya scored in the third minute of a nationally televised game against DC United. After celebrating with teammates, he found a broadcast microphone and shouted a message to a nation rocked by two mass shootings that weekend: \u201cHey Congress, do something now. End gun violence. Let\u2019s go!\u201d His words rocketed around the internet, the video garnering millions of views. The reaction surprised no one more than Bedoya, who found out from an Audi Field security guard at halftime that his moment had gone viral. In the hours before the game, Bedoya had tweeted about the mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton that had claimed a combined total of more than 30 lives. He\u2019d talked about them with family, including a group chat with friends who, half-jokingly, challenged Bedoya to use his visibility to get his voice out there. As he went through his usual pre-match routine, the tragedies remained in his thoughts. \u201cThe fact that I scored an early goal, third minute, I\u2019m guessing everything was fresh in my mind,\u201d Bedoya said. \u201cSo maybe it was a sign from God or something that, hey, you have a platform, speak out. I don\u2019t know. It just happened.\u201d Bedoya isn\u2019t new to the issue. His wife, Beatrice, is Norwegian, a country rocked by a mass shooting in 2011 that caused profound changes in its approach to gun violence. Bedoya grew up in Weston, Florida, 20 miles from Parkland, site of a mass shooting at Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School in 2018. Bedoya had played soccer there and knew people personally affected, speaking out in support of victims in the 2018 season opener. His professional career has taken him all over the world, from 66 caps with the United States to club stints in France, Scotland and Sweden. He\u2019s had teammates and friends from many nations, able to see issues here and abroad through a diverse set of viewpoints. While many Americans are lulled into thinking of gun violence as an intractable problem, Bedoya has seen other countries successfully grapple with it. \u201cI think people get stuck in their American ways of thinking,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of Americans haven\u2019t been able to travel the world or seen other things or seen the way it is in other places. \u2026 I think in a lot of ways, my global perspective has helped me realize there is a gun violence problem in this country. There\u2019s no secret about that.\u201d Since his 10 impassioned words on Fox Sports \u2013 which he tells the Guardian he doesn\u2019t regret and wouldn\u2019t change \u2013 Bedoya has spoken with great care. He stressed that his call was nonpartisan, not a political gesture but one of a concerned citizen, a human being and father before an athlete.

He decried many of the causes that politicians and pundits point to, like mental health and social/family issues, as present in other countries but without corresponding violence because of gun-control measures.

The most impactful dialogues he\u2019s had, though, have been with victims of mass shootings. \u201cIt\u2019s victims of these types of shootings that still suffer mentally of course after the tragedy happens, suffer from anxiety, that are just happy to offer words of support for me,\u201d he said. \u201c[They said] that has helped them grieve, helped them try to understand more, help them at least for one day have hope that we can get somewhere and to try to stop this from happening to somebody else, to other communities.\u201d The El Paso shooting stood out in particular to Bedoya.

There\u2019s a lot of weirdness in a slum, there\u2019s a special weirdness in Kibera. And you cannot be sad all day.</p> <p>\u201cMy comedy comes from pain, having lived and grown up in Kibera. This is the life I know, I can\u2019t compare it to anything else. To me, having a \u201cteatime\u201d is funny, why would you have meals between meals that are already a struggle to find? If anything bad happens to me I have to laugh at it. First I cry, then I laugh. There\u2019s a sad and a funny side to everything.</p> <p>\u201cIn my show there are a lot of NGO jokes. I make jokes about the small kids in the 20-year-old (donated) T-shirts that are too big, jokes about how many verses of song the children will sing for the money the white lady has donated to the school. There\u2019s a lot of laughter to be had at the uniqueness of this place. I talk about issues, corruption, leadership, just through the prism of comedy.</p> <p>\u201cI come from a single-mother family and my mum is very chilled about what I do. Maybe if my dad was around he would be very harsh about my job.</p> <p>Men are a difficult area for me. It\u2019s challenging because men [in Kibera] still have the thing: \u2018I am a man and no woman can tell me anything\u2019, which is frustrating for a career woman. They want to change you, distract you.</p> <p>\u201cIn Kibera there is a great network of creative people, musicians, dancers, actors, even people making beadwork. We only have very small spaces and that is something I think that needs to, and will, change.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"6612ccd15dc69c8845a59dac5a89784a88de1e2b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6612ccd15dc69c8845a59dac5a89784a88de1e2b/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Aduda owns and runs a successful hotel known as Dreams in Kibera\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Aduda owns and runs a successful hotel known as Dreams in Kibera</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kate Holt/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The hotel owner</h2> <p><strong>Tom Aduda, 48, </strong>is the proprietor of Dreams, a hotel and one of very few buildings in Kibera above a single storey.</p> <p>The hotel has grown over the years \u2013 wood, metal, panels, stairs and floors have been tacked and welded together with an ingenuity perfected in a place where conventional building materials are beyond reach. Aduda employs eight people and works 20-hour days. He moved to Kibera as a schoolboy when his dad left home, leaving his mother to bring up eight children alone.</p> <p>\u201cThings were better then in Kibera, cleaner. The water was clean in the river. We played football. Now, where I played football, there are buildings, and where we used to swim, there\u2019s dirty garbage.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard for the children. Kids have to be kids. They have no place to play, no place to run. I would not start a family here.</p> <p>\u201cMy mother made illicit beer, that\u2019s what paid to bring us up. I don\u2019t drink now because of what I saw growing up around alcohol. I went to college. Then I started with a tiny shop and then built up the hotel bit by bit. Now I have 10 rooms and a reputation for cleanliness. I am proud of this place.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a tough job, you are your own security. But I am a tough guy. 99% of business in Kibera is about survival.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t pay tax but I don\u2019t get any services from the government either. The police are just out to collect money at every opportunity.</p> <p>\u201cYou have to pay off the police, whether you have a licence or not. Every week I have to give the police something, and on a monthly basis as well.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019d rather do your business than have disruption so you pay it. I\u2019m from here and known here, so for me the gangs are not so much of a problem, but for women it\u2019s very bad here. Very bad.</p> <p>\u201cWhen Kibera was began building up there were so many rooms. Now you can\u2019t find a room anywhere that\u2019s vacant.</p> <p>\u201cMy clientele come here from up country to look for jobs and find it\u2019s not the place they thought, but 99% don\u2019t go back. Life is cheap, so they get used to it and stay. In my mind I would rather be up country. I would love to retire with some chickens and goats and have a simple, good life. It would be lovely.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe anything is changing. They [the government] talk about upgrading, but they have been saying that for years and then they spend the money somewhere else.</p> <p>\u201cNothing changes in Kibera.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"b6a56ceb5da1142b055e43d98da00933aa3cd08f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b6a56ceb5da1142b055e43d98da00933aa3cd08f/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kibera is one of the largest slums in Africa and is home to an estimated 500,000 people, most of whom live on less than one dollar a day.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kibera is one of the largest slums in Africa and is home to an estimated 500,000 people, most of whom live on less than a dollar a day</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kate Holt/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The shopkeeper</h2> <p><strong>Evaline Atieno, 36,</strong> has been running her chip shop for six years, expanding from a stall to a back room with two long tables and benches for sit-in customers.

So this was the natural next step.\u201d</p> <p>After school she won a place to study IT with local charity <a href=\"https://www.shofco.org/\">Shofco</a>, and then a scholarship to study entrepreneurship in Ghana. She left the slum to study, but suffered from depression and anxiety in an unfamiliar culture. \u201cI was so low in weight, I was constantly sick, I cried all the time. It just got really messy. I was drawn to come back.</p> <p>\u201cMy family didn\u2019t understand what I was doing. When I started my business no one believed in me. They said you should get a job, you won\u2019t survive.

I applied for college but I could not afford the fees.</p> <p>\u201cI soon realised nobody was telling our story. The only thing people know about Kibera is poverty and disaster, but it\u2019s more than that.</p> <p>\u201cYoung people need spaces to create and be ourselves. Kids want to be poets, dancers, footballers. But they cannot express themselves. When we grew up we thought mental health was a rich person\u2019s disease. We don\u2019t even talk to our parents. The only time my dad said \u2018I love you\u2019, he died the next day. I never heard my mum say it. But she fed us so she must have. There were no hugs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"141456b8d36e6f968fca8a52890fb504f5ef2db6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/141456b8d36e6f968fca8a52890fb504f5ef2db6/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Two boys play a board game in front of their homes\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Two boys play a board game in front of their homes</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kate Holt/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cYou were not allowed to cry or complain.

      "bodyText": "Living in a slum is the reality for 1 billion people and rising across the world. More than half of Africa\u2019s city dwellers live in \u201cinformal settlements\u201d and the continent\u2019s biggest is Kibera, in Kenya. We heard from people there about their struggles, aspirations and their innovation, busting the myths and stereotypes about being poor and powerless. The performer Mammito Eunice, 25, is a stand-up comic. \u201cI can make a living as long as I can make people laugh. \u201cThis place has a lot of material. There\u2019s a lot of weirdness in a slum, there\u2019s a special weirdness in Kibera. And you cannot be sad all day. \u201cMy comedy comes from pain, having lived and grown up in Kibera. This is the life I know, I can\u2019t compare it to anything else. To me, having a \u201cteatime\u201d is funny, why would you have meals between meals that are already a struggle to find? If anything bad happens to me I have to laugh at it. First I cry, then I laugh. There\u2019s a sad and a funny side to everything. \u201cIn my show there are a lot of NGO jokes. I make jokes about the small kids in the 20-year-old (donated) T-shirts that are too big, jokes about how many verses of song the children will sing for the money the white lady has donated to the school. There\u2019s a lot of laughter to be had at the uniqueness of this place. I talk about issues, corruption, leadership, just through the prism of comedy. \u201cI come from a single-mother family and my mum is very chilled about what I do. Maybe if my dad was around he would be very harsh about my job. Men are a difficult area for me. It\u2019s challenging because men [in Kibera] still have the thing: \u2018I am a man and no woman can tell me anything\u2019, which is frustrating for a career woman. They want to change you, distract you. \u201cIn Kibera there is a great network of creative people, musicians, dancers, actors, even people making beadwork. We only have very small spaces and that is something I think that needs to, and will, change.\u201d The hotel owner Tom Aduda, 48, is the proprietor of Dreams, a hotel and one of very few buildings in Kibera above a single storey. The hotel has grown over the years \u2013 wood, metal, panels, stairs and floors have been tacked and welded together with an ingenuity perfected in a place where conventional building materials are beyond reach. Aduda employs eight people and works 20-hour days. He moved to Kibera as a schoolboy when his dad left home, leaving his mother to bring up eight children alone. \u201cThings were better then in Kibera, cleaner. The water was clean in the river. We played football. Now, where I played football, there are buildings, and where we used to swim, there\u2019s dirty garbage. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for the children. Kids have to be kids. They have no place to play, no place to run. I would not start a family here. \u201cMy mother made illicit beer, that\u2019s what paid to bring us up. I don\u2019t drink now because of what I saw growing up around alcohol. I went to college. Then I started with a tiny shop and then built up the hotel bit by bit. Now I have 10 rooms and a reputation for cleanliness. I am proud of this place. \u201cThis is a tough job, you are your own security. But I am a tough guy. 99% of business in Kibera is about survival. \u201cI don\u2019t pay tax but I don\u2019t get any services from the government either. The police are just out to collect money at every opportunity. \u201cYou have to pay off the police, whether you have a licence or not. Every week I have to give the police something, and on a monthly basis as well. \u201cYou\u2019d rather do your business than have disruption so you pay it. I\u2019m from here and known here, so for me the gangs are not so much of a problem, but for women it\u2019s very bad here. Very bad. \u201cWhen Kibera was began building up there were so many rooms. Now you can\u2019t find a room anywhere that\u2019s vacant. \u201cMy clientele come here from up country to look for jobs and find it\u2019s not the place they thought, but 99% don\u2019t go back. Life is cheap, so they get used to it and stay. In my mind I would rather be up country. I would love to retire with some chickens and goats and have a simple, good life. It would be lovely. \u201cI don\u2019t believe anything is changing. They [the government] talk about upgrading, but they have been saying that for years and then they spend the money somewhere else. \u201cNothing changes in Kibera.\u201d The shopkeeper Evaline Atieno, 36, has been running her chip shop for six years, expanding from a stall to a back room with two long tables and benches for sit-in customers. A bucket of cold water holds bottles of neon-coloured drinks. She employs four people and sends her three children to school. \u201cIt is called Eva\u2019s Place,\u201d she says. \u201cOur special thing is that this place is very clean.\u201d Between her and her friend Caroline Ayuma, they peel their way through six buckets of potatoes each day by hand. \u201cWe are different tribes, Luo and Luhya, but here we work for the same thing. We have to be a special place, better than the others. \u201cThe problem is that we now have a lot of competition here in Kibera. So many new people are arriving all the time and setting up new places. It is becoming harder and harder to earn a living. It takes a lot of time and a lot of energy to keep a business going in this place.\u201d \u201cYou have to maintain the price, you have to maintain the cleanliness. That is what makes my place the best.\u201d The IT businesswoman Margaret Aoko, 23, was born and lives in Kibera. \u201cIt is a very difficult place to live. There\u2019s a lot of harassment for women. It\u2019s embarrassing and it\u2019s difficult and you just can\u2019t do anything about it. You have to accept it.\u201d Aoko, the fifth of seven children of a mechanic and a seamstress, founded a company called Papshop \u2013 linking entrepreneurs to wider markets, connecting them to consumers, and building their brand awareness and sales on and offline. \u201cI was passionate about local artisans and I was blogging their stories so people could see the amazing things they were doing. So this was the natural next step.\u201d After school she won a place to study IT with local charity Shofco, and then a scholarship to study entrepreneurship in Ghana. She left the slum to study, but suffered from depression and anxiety in an unfamiliar culture. \u201cI was so low in weight, I was constantly sick, I cried all the time. It just got really messy. I was drawn to come back. \u201cMy family didn\u2019t understand what I was doing. When I started my business no one believed in me. They said you should get a job, you won\u2019t survive. But this is something I love. I feel I need to grow. More connections need to be made between people. \u201cThere are so many problems that I want to solve in Kibera, I wouldn\u2019t just leave here. I can\u2019t leave here.\u201d The musician Henry \u201cOctopizzo\u201d Ohanga, 31, is a successful Kenyan rap artist, born in Kibera: \u201cMy dad met my mum here when she was running a groundnut stall. My dad bought a lot of groundnuts before she would be persuaded to marry him. \u201cI wanted to be a horticulturist \u2013 I thought it must be wonderful to see flowers. Growing up, I counted that I saw maybe five flowers in 21 years in Kibera. Can you imagine a flower at every door here? The peace that might bring? \u201cMy parents died when I was 14. The three youngest children went back to our village but my mum was in a microfinance scheme so I was able to finish school. Afterwards, I just wanted to find a job but it\u2019s hard in Kibera, you have to know people such as a family member. I applied for college but I could not afford the fees. \u201cI soon realised nobody was telling our story. The only thing people know about Kibera is poverty and disaster, but it\u2019s more than that. \u201cYoung people need spaces to create and be ourselves. Kids want to be poets, dancers, footballers. But they cannot express themselves. When we grew up we thought mental health was a rich person\u2019s disease. We don\u2019t even talk to our parents. The only time my dad said \u2018I love you\u2019, he died the next day. I never heard my mum say it. But she fed us so she must have. There were no hugs. \u201cYou were not allowed to cry or complain. You were dubbed weak. Because you can\u2019t survive if you cry. So you hold a lot of stuff in and that\u2019s a lot of trauma. \u201cI Googled \u2018how to be a dad\u2019 when my daughter was born. \u201cHere people don\u2019t consider you a success with art until you are really successful. My aunt didn\u2019t talk to me for three years because she thought rap was a shameful thing. The problem with this generation of ours is that people are so afraid of failing that they don\u2019t even try: 99% are so convinced they will never make it out of here that they never try. \u201cPeople assume if you come from here you are a thug. If you can\u2019t speak English they think you are stupid. But that is not us. The young people here are creative, there is a slang called Sheng, a mix of Swahili, English and our mother tongues. It changes every day, it\u2019s a vibrant, amazing thing, and that is who the people here are. \u201cI love this place to death. There is nowhere in the world like Kibera.\u201d The teacher Cecilia Ayoti, 38, was 15 when she was forced to leave home afterfalling pregnant. \u201cI was a bright daughter and my father was very bitter, he was a drunkard and he would get mad every time he looked at me.

No matter the size of United\u2019s summer splurge \u2013 and the Blades have spent more in the past four weeks than in the previous 14 years \u2013 nothing will overshadow the importance of keeping hold of a manager who has masterminded the club\u2019s rise from League One to the Premier League in three seasons.</p> \n<p>It has been a swift ascension for the club but a long road for their manager. Of the five men taking charge of Premier League teams for the first time this weekend \u2013 Wilder, Dean Smith, Graham Potter, Frank Lampard and Daniel Farke \u2013 Wilder has had by far the lengthiest apprenticeship.

On 9 July Chris Wilder signed a new contract to 2022. No matter the size of United\u2019s summer splurge \u2013 and the Blades have spent more in the past four weeks than in the previous 14 years \u2013 nothing will overshadow the importance of keeping hold of a manager who has masterminded the club\u2019s rise from League One to the Premier League in three seasons. It has been a swift ascension for the club but a long road for their manager. Of the five men taking charge of Premier League teams for the first time this weekend \u2013 Wilder, Dean Smith, Graham Potter, Frank Lampard and Daniel Farke \u2013 Wilder has had by far the lengthiest apprenticeship. The 51-year-old is closing in on 1,000 games as a manager (not counting his time coaching Bradway FC in the Meadowhall Sunday League), the majority coming in six-year spells with Halifax Town and Oxford United. The Blades were ailing when he returned as manager in the summer of 2016, and under Nigel Adkins had just registered their lowest league finish since 1982 \u2013 11th in League One.

In a year this totals a profit of \u00a373m taken out of children\u2019s social services.</p> <p>Three-quarters of children\u2019s homes in England are already provided by for-profit private companies. Almost a third of local authorities no longer directly provide any children\u2019s residential care. As at 31 March 2018, 6,990 children <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/756192/Children_looked_after_in_England_2018_National_tables.xlsx\">were placed by local authorities in private children\u2019s homes</a>.

With a profit level of 10% on such placements, the total annual profit would be \u00a3110m. </p> <p>In local authorities in England, 15% of social workers in children\u2019s social services are employed through private for-profit employment agencies, and local authorities are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/apr/07/social-work-recruiting-woes-see-councils-pay-millions-to-agencies\">paying \u00a3335m</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/apr/07/social-work-recruiting-woes-see-councils-pay-millions-to-agencies\"> a year for agency social workers</a>. Assuming just 5% profit, that would add up to \u00a316.75m, while profits by social worker employment agencies in England from children\u2019s social services are likely to be more than \u00a310m a year.</p> <p>In total, profits of more than \u00a3220m a year are being taken out of local authority children\u2019s services by private companies, including overhead and transaction costs. That is equivalent to local authorities employing about 4,400 children\u2019s social workers \u2013 and if each social worker helped about 20 children and families a week, it would mean almost 88,000 more children and families getting help. </p> <p>But even more importantly, not only are local authorities spending large sums with private companies, they are purchasing poorer quality services at a higher cost.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/20/society-weekly-email-newsletter-sign-up\">Sign up for Society Weekly: our newsletter for public service professionals</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Some 84% of children in private children\u2019s homes and 50% of children in private fostering agency placements are <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/756192/Children_looked_after_in_England_2018_National_tables.xlsx\">not within the area of the local authority</a>.

      "bodyText": "For the past 40 years, successive governments have pushed crucial services out of public ownership and into the private market. Despite the dismal track record of big outsourcing companies failing to deliver on their public service contracts, and overcharging central and local government, opportunities continue for private companies to make money from the public purse. This is now being challenged by Labour with a commitment to bring vital services back into public ownership and control. Nowhere should this be more urgent than for services that protect and care for children. Since 2010, Conservative-led governments have coerced local authorities to contract out statutory children\u2019s social services. In 2014, despite wide opposition, regulatory changes were introduced allowing commercial companies the power to take children away from their families along with other child protection services. Companies such as G4S, Serco, Virgin Care, Mott MacDonald and Amey have been hovering around the Department for Education ready to scoop up contracts. Privatised children\u2019s social services are already a big moneymaker for commercial companies, with funds that should be spent on helping children and families being taken as profit. Increasingly, the owners of these companies are private equity companies and distant venture capitalists. For children in foster care, on 31 March 2018, 16,200 (39% of all foster children in England) were in placements arranged through for-profit agencies. A government-commissioned 2018 report found that the average weekly cost to local authorities of each these placements was \u00a3823 compared to a cost of \u00a3553 for those provided directly by a local authority with its foster carers, and that the private agencies were making a profit of 10.5%. In a year this totals a profit of \u00a373m taken out of children\u2019s social services. Three-quarters of children\u2019s homes in England are already provided by for-profit private companies. Almost a third of local authorities no longer directly provide any children\u2019s residential care. As at 31 March 2018, 6,990 children were placed by local authorities in private children\u2019s homes. In 2016, the average weekly cost of a private children\u2019s home placement was \u00a33,289. With a profit level of 10% on such placements, the total annual profit would be \u00a3110m. In local authorities in England, 15% of social workers in children\u2019s social services are employed through private for-profit employment agencies, and local authorities are paying \u00a3335m a year for agency social workers. Assuming just 5% profit, that would add up to \u00a316.75m, while profits by social worker employment agencies in England from children\u2019s social services are likely to be more than \u00a310m a year. In total, profits of more than \u00a3220m a year are being taken out of local authority children\u2019s services by private companies, including overhead and transaction costs. That is equivalent to local authorities employing about 4,400 children\u2019s social workers \u2013 and if each social worker helped about 20 children and families a week, it would mean almost 88,000 more children and families getting help. But even more importantly, not only are local authorities spending large sums with private companies, they are purchasing poorer quality services at a higher cost. Some 84% of children in private children\u2019s homes and 50% of children in private fostering agency placements are not within the area of the local authority. Often, private children\u2019s homes pay their staff less and have fewer staff than local authority homes. Short-term agency social workers may have little knowledge of the children and families with whom they are working. This is not a disaster waiting to happen; it is one that is happening today. It should be a priority for any government, whether Labour or not, to end the privatisation children\u2019s social services. For a start, local authorities should have to report how many children are in care directly provided by the council and how many social workers they employ directly. Councillors should also to commit to caring for children within their communities, rather than sending them away. \u2022 Ray Jones is emeritus professor of social work at Kingston University and St George\u2019s, University of London, and the author of In Whose Interest?

Strangely, then, the first songs from her forthcoming seventh album Lover didn\u2019t really do that \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/apr/26/taylor-swifts-me-is-a-musical-inspired-return-to-her-happily-uncool-brand\">ME!</a> and You Need to Calm Down had anthemic, outward-facing intentions, celebrating weirdness and telling bigots to wind it in. But The Archer does: looking deeply inwards, it might be the most personal and self-lacerating song Swift has ever released. She sounds wearied by her self-professed immaturity (\u201cI never grew up / It\u2019s getting so old\u201d) and self-defeatist tendencies (\u201cI cut off my nose just to spite my face / Then I hate my reflection for years and years\u201d), conflicted by her roles as predator and victim. It\u2019s not a proper single \u2013 there\u2019s no headline-grabbing video \u2013 and the production is low-key, just a blooming Chromatics-y synth glow that builds but never breaks, so it\u2019s had a quieter reception than Lover\u2019s first two singles. But it\u2019s a small, sincere marvel. <strong>LS</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzmH-C8vG0\">Kano \u2013 Trouble</a></h2> <p>Kano was one of the great breakthroughs of grime\u2019s first wave with tracks like P\u2019s and Q\u2019s, and showed major ambition with albums that also straddled R&amp;B, jungle and hip-hop. Like fellow originators Skepta and Wiley, he too had a fallow period \u2013 2010 flop Method to the Madnesss \u2013 before hurtling back with renewed vigour, for 2016\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/mar/10/kano-made-in-the-manor-review-grime-mainstay-finds-a-reflective-maturity\">Made in the Manor</a>, his best album yet. A pair of new tracks suggest the follow-up could be even better. A little like Strangers from his previous album, Trouble uses piano and sparse drums, giving Kano space to plead for an end to cyclical gang violence. \u201cYou ever seen a mother\u2019s tears run down Gucci glasses?\u201d, he asks, criticising both the violence itself and the peacocking consumerism that partly powers it in a single line. But he encourages rather than scolds, and gives short shrift to politicians who would do the latter: \u201cThese gunshots never reach your town\u201d. The result is a moving, charismatic UK twist on the gospel rap of Kanye West and Chance the Rapper. <strong>BBT</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Bq5s2oRp24\">Jenny Hval \u2013 Ashes to Ashes</a></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"578b11d97681e19af9e1e69c0fc8615ce6b5ce05\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/578b11d97681e19af9e1e69c0fc8615ce6b5ce05/0_0_5616_3744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jenny Hval.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jenny Hval.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There\u2019s a great tradition of meta songs, the kind where musicians sing about an imagined song that becomes real through their writing. Norwegian pop experimentalist Jenny Hval is great at this sort of conceptual summoning \u2013 and somehow, in Ashes to Ashes, she doesn\u2019t just make a dreamed song real, but turns it into a chilling meditation on mortality and the fragile boundaries between permanence and transience. A friend dreams about burying someone\u2019s ashes then having a cigarette; Hval dreams about digging her own grave and it being like playing an instrument; about sexual fantasy as a form of suffocation. That would all be hard work if not for how light Ashes to Ashes is, a pulsing, clubbing pop gem that, like her theme, seems to hover between reality and reverie. <strong>LS</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chSZCtLrgz8\">Charli XCX &amp; Christine and the Queens \u2013 Gone</a></h2> <p>The production of Charli XCX and Christine and the Queens\u2019 killer collaboration \u2013 courtesy of PC Music\u2019s AG Cook, and someone called \u00d6 \u2013 sounds like fists battering against a locked door, a frenzied plea for escape. Both <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jul/08/charli-xcx-every-single-thing-is-work-for-me-everything-is-music-interview\">Charli</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/sep/22/christine-and-the-queens-ive-just-discovered-sex-i-cant-stop-yet\">Chris</a> have talked about battling the closed-minded limitations of the industry; by coming together, they liberate each other and push pop further into the future. In Gone, they reject an indifferent, fickle scene (\u201cpour me one more / watch the ice melt in my fist\u201d might be Charli\u2019s best lyric yet) and then forge their own private language. What does it mean to \u201ckeep when the water runs\u201d? I don\u2019t know, but it\u2019s the kind of idiosyncratic linguistic quirk that pop magic is made from. That \u201ckeep\u201d repeats and fragments through the rest of the song, a battering ram of persistence and self-possession that drives their liberation home (a feat made clearer in the superb video, where Chris frees Charli from bondage and they have a majestic dance-off on top of a car in the rain). <strong>LS</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFoqGyWhMws\">NCT 127 \u2013 Highway to Heaven</a></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9d81d7d6e75d65c99f1966684776ea5ae0c3939a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9d81d7d6e75d65c99f1966684776ea5ae0c3939a/0_1089_2100_1568/1000.jpg\" alt=\"NCT 127.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"747\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">NCT 127.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: -</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This startlingly beautiful 10-piece K-pop boyband is actually one of four subsets of an overall 21-member group, NCT, and while it\u2019s easy to be cynical about the reasoning underpinning this setup \u2013 four lots of merch to flog to obsessive fans! \u2013 it\u2019s much harder to resist the charms of new single Highway to Heaven.

      "bodyText": "Taylor Swift \u2013 The Archer Back in February, Taylor Swift wrote for Elle about the importance of specificity in pop songs: \u201cWe like being confided in and hearing someone say, \u2018This is what I went through\u2019 as proof to us that we can get through our own struggles,\u201d she declared. Strangely, then, the first songs from her forthcoming seventh album Lover didn\u2019t really do that \u2013 ME! and You Need to Calm Down had anthemic, outward-facing intentions, celebrating weirdness and telling bigots to wind it in. But The Archer does: looking deeply inwards, it might be the most personal and self-lacerating song Swift has ever released. She sounds wearied by her self-professed immaturity (\u201cI never grew up / It\u2019s getting so old\u201d) and self-defeatist tendencies (\u201cI cut off my nose just to spite my face / Then I hate my reflection for years and years\u201d), conflicted by her roles as predator and victim. It\u2019s not a proper single \u2013 there\u2019s no headline-grabbing video \u2013 and the production is low-key, just a blooming Chromatics-y synth glow that builds but never breaks, so it\u2019s had a quieter reception than Lover\u2019s first two singles. But it\u2019s a small, sincere marvel. LS Kano \u2013 Trouble Kano was one of the great breakthroughs of grime\u2019s first wave with tracks like P\u2019s and Q\u2019s, and showed major ambition with albums that also straddled R&amp;B, jungle and hip-hop. Like fellow originators Skepta and Wiley, he too had a fallow period \u2013 2010 flop Method to the Madnesss \u2013 before hurtling back with renewed vigour, for 2016\u2019s Made in the Manor, his best album yet. A pair of new tracks suggest the follow-up could be even better. A little like Strangers from his previous album, Trouble uses piano and sparse drums, giving Kano space to plead for an end to cyclical gang violence. \u201cYou ever seen a mother\u2019s tears run down Gucci glasses?\u201d, he asks, criticising both the violence itself and the peacocking consumerism that partly powers it in a single line. But he encourages rather than scolds, and gives short shrift to politicians who would do the latter: \u201cThese gunshots never reach your town\u201d. The result is a moving, charismatic UK twist on the gospel rap of Kanye West and Chance the Rapper. BBT Jenny Hval \u2013 Ashes to Ashes There\u2019s a great tradition of meta songs, the kind where musicians sing about an imagined song that becomes real through their writing. Norwegian pop experimentalist Jenny Hval is great at this sort of conceptual summoning \u2013 and somehow, in Ashes to Ashes, she doesn\u2019t just make a dreamed song real, but turns it into a chilling meditation on mortality and the fragile boundaries between permanence and transience. A friend dreams about burying someone\u2019s ashes then having a cigarette; Hval dreams about digging her own grave and it being like playing an instrument; about sexual fantasy as a form of suffocation. That would all be hard work if not for how light Ashes to Ashes is, a pulsing, clubbing pop gem that, like her theme, seems to hover between reality and reverie. LS Charli XCX &amp; Christine and the Queens \u2013 Gone The production of Charli XCX and Christine and the Queens\u2019 killer collaboration \u2013 courtesy of PC Music\u2019s AG Cook, and someone called \u00d6 \u2013 sounds like fists battering against a locked door, a frenzied plea for escape. Both Charli and Chris have talked about battling the closed-minded limitations of the industry; by coming together, they liberate each other and push pop further into the future. In Gone, they reject an indifferent, fickle scene (\u201cpour me one more / watch the ice melt in my fist\u201d might be Charli\u2019s best lyric yet) and then forge their own private language. What does it mean to \u201ckeep when the water runs\u201d? I don\u2019t know, but it\u2019s the kind of idiosyncratic linguistic quirk that pop magic is made from. That \u201ckeep\u201d repeats and fragments through the rest of the song, a battering ram of persistence and self-possession that drives their liberation home (a feat made clearer in the superb video, where Chris frees Charli from bondage and they have a majestic dance-off on top of a car in the rain). LS NCT 127 \u2013 Highway to Heaven This startlingly beautiful 10-piece K-pop boyband is actually one of four subsets of an overall 21-member group, NCT, and while it\u2019s easy to be cynical about the reasoning underpinning this setup \u2013 four lots of merch to flog to obsessive fans! \u2013 it\u2019s much harder to resist the charms of new single Highway to Heaven. The English-language lyrics rather make you long for Korean, particularly the rapping (\u201cSkrrt, pull up in the coupe, beep-beep\u201d), but the spectacular chorus and soft-rock verses make this a kind of Boys of Summer 2019. Also of note in K-pop this month is Baekhyun, whose versatile voice winds jazzily through the snapping rap production on mini-album City Lights. BBT Sam Smith \u2013 How Do You Sleep Sam Smith and Max Martin bounce back from the precipice of irrelevance with this sublime \u201cI\u2019m not angry, just disappointed\u201d club heartbreaker, all trap beats and dramatic bassy slurs. Smith\u2019s lover is a liar who\u2019s making him crazy. He swears he\u2019ll leave, no longer able to recognise himself, but not entirely cheated of his optimism: \u201cI\u2019m hoping that my love will keep you up tonight,\u201d he says, clinging on to the promise that there\u2019s nobility in devotion. Critics have whispered about Sam Smith in the same breath as George Michael before, but this sophisticated, assured comeback is the first time he\u2019s truly lived up to the comparison. LS Africa Express \u2013 City in Lights The standout from the latest Africa Express sessions in Johannesburg pairs Yeah Yeah Yeahs guitarist Nick Zinner with Ugandan electro acholi star Otim Alpha, London producer Georgia and South African vocal harmony group Mahotella Queens. Georgia takes the vocal lead, singing with sweet determination about Hilda Tloubatla leaving her township to join the Mahotella Queens in 1960s Johannesburg, the city hustle and bustle reflected in Alpha\u2019s darkly glittering, pumping production. LS Black Country, New Road \u2013 Sunglasses Anchored by a remarkable drummer, this seven-piece British post-punk band may only have released one song so far but are playing the kind of thrilling gigs it takes others months of touring to work up to. Their second release, the nine-minute Sunglasses, sets out their stall: skronky brass and a Tortoise-ish groove shift up a gear to hurtle into a wildly strident climax.

Signing Rooney will bring money into Derby (though, if they get anywhere near paying his \u00a3100,000-per-week salary at DC, it will also mean money going out). That money will require, at least some of the time, that Rooney is a present, visible part of the club. If the England icon falls out of form, for example, or gets arrested for a drinking-related misdemeanour (as he has been twice in the past two years) then what does Cocu do then? The Derby manager is himself no footballing small fry and, as a Dutchman, will not be shy about expressing his own feelings should the moment require it. Whether this deal is successful will come down in many ways to perception and Cocu will be the guy who has to manage that. Good luck, Phillip!",

      "bodyText": "Energy bills for millions of British households will fall by \u00a375 this winter after Ofgem reduced its price cap on standard tariffs to reflect lower costs for suppliers. Under the lowered cap, the average annual energy bill for 11m homes will fall from \u00a31,254 to \u00a31,179 through the months from 1 October to the end of March. A further 4m households will benefit from a \u00a325 fall in their winter energy bill under a separate cap for pre-paid meters. Pre-payment meter customers will pay a maximum of \u00a31,217, down from \u00a31,242. The industry\u2019s statutory regulator said it lowered the price cap to reflect falling energy market costs, which typically make up almost half of the average household energy bill. The UK\u2019s tumbling gas and electricity market prices helped to wipe out the slightly higher cost of investing in energy networks and renewable energy projects, which are paid for through bills. Dermot Nolan, the chief executive of Ofgem, said: \u201cThe price caps require suppliers to pass on any savings to customers when their cost to supply electricity and gas falls. \u201cThis means the energy bills of around 15 million customers on default deals or pre-payment meters will fall this winter to reflect the reduction in cost of the wholesale energy,\u201d he said. The regulator introduced the energy price cap on 1 January after sustained pressure from the government to stop energy companies from taking advantage of loyal customers. Under the cap, energy companies are allowed to make only \u00a321 of profit from the average annual energy bill, which has dealt a heavy financial blow to the biggest suppliers. Ofgem estimated that the cap would effectively save bill payers \u00a31bn by cutting \u201covercharging\u201d from the energy market. British Gas has taken the brunt of the financial blow after issuing a warning that it would lose \u00a3300m this year as a result of the cap. Its owner, Centrica, is also cutting thousands of jobs and has halved dividend payouts to shareholders, which include 60,000 individuals. SSE was also forced to issue a profit warning before revealing it had lost \u00a3176m from its supply business by the end of March, only three months after the cap was brought in. A spokesman for SSE said theprice cap was \u201crife with unintended and undesirable consequences\u201d. \u201cWe believe that vulnerable customers who face particular barriers may require continued support but wider price interventions are unhelpful,\u201d the spokesperson said. The company is calling for the government to replace the current cap with a regularly published benchmark price which would act as a guide for consumers by pinpointing a fair energy price. \u201cNo one likes to see jobs being lost but the companies did need to make cuts to operating costs and they did need to be more efficient,\u201d Nolan said. Greg Jackson, the chief executive of Octopus Energy, said: \u201cI\u2019m sure Big 6 lobbyists will be trying to get the government to drop the cap, but it\u2019s proven to be as important in protecting energy customers as the minimum wage is for workers.\u201d There are more than 100 fixed-price energy deals on offer, many of which are hundreds of pounds cheaper than the price of Ofgem\u2019s energy cap. Natalie Hitchins, head of home products and services at the consumer group Which?, urged customers to switch energy providers to gain the best rate. \u201cLowering the price cap will provide some relief to hard-pressed households \u2013 but millions of energy customers on default tariffs will still be left paying hundreds of pounds more than they need to each year,\u201d she said. Households using pre-pay meters often find it more difficult to switch supplier, and will see a smaller cut to their energy bills than standard energy tariffs after the Competition and Markets Authority adjusted the way in which it is calculated. As a result, pre-pay customers, who are more likely to be vulnerable, will for the first time pay more than standard users under Ofgem\u2019s energy price cap because the regulator factors in the higher operating costs of maintaining the meters. Peter Smith, a director at the fuel poverty charity NEA (National Energy Action), said more should be done to protect the fuel poor, including more taxpayer-funded support and home insulations. \u201cWe must also address the main causes of fuel poverty and invest central government funding back into energy efficiency,\u201d he said.",

      "body": "<p>\u201cThere are wounds of time and there are wounds of person,\u201d cautions a camel driver in the extraordinary second novel by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jun/10/tea-obreht-the-tigers-wife-orange-prize\" title=\"\">T\u00e9a Obreht</a>. \u201cSometimes people come through their wounds, but time does not. Sometimes it\u2019s the other way around. Sometimes the wounds are so grievous, there\u2019s no coming through them at all.\u201d Obreht is superb at tracing such inescapable wounds, both personal and national. Her 2011 Orange prize-winning debut, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/mar/12/tigers-wife-tea-obreht-review\" title=\"\"><em>The Tiger\u2019s Wife</em></a>, mapped the aftermath of civil conflict in an unnamed \u201cBalkan country still scarred by war\u201d, which was based on her native Serbia (born in Belgrade in 1985, Obreht moved to the US at the age of 12). The fictional territory of <em>Inland</em> is as vivid and as violent: Arizona in the second half of the 19th century, populated by \u201ccowpokes and prospectors\u201d, gunslingers and cattle kings \u2013 and, yes, cameleers.</p> <p>Magic realism served Obreht well in her fable about Yugoslavia\u2019s baroque divisions, and it\u2019s no less effective in shaping this alternative foundation myth about the American west. On the face of it the book begins conventionally enough, with the story of an outlaw, Lurie, who is on the run. The twist lies in Obreht\u2019s affinity for unusual transformations. Like her, Lurie comes to America from the Balkans, as an immigrant child called Djuri\u0107. His surname is swiftly anglicised and he has a brief career as a gang member before falling in with the US Camel Corps on its way from Texas to California. Here truth proves stranger than fiction. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2013/jun/22/top-10-us-iconic-road-signs\" title=\"\">Camel Corps </a>was a short-lived experiment introducing the animals into the US army as beasts of burden, manned by drivers from the Ottoman empire. Billed by wanted posters as a \u201chirsute Levantine\u201d, Lurie finds that his ambiguous ethnicity provides the perfect cover for a new life as an ersatz camel-riding Turk.</p> <p>Lurie is just one of many wounded trying to remake themselves in a terrain whose emptiness serves as a clean slate for fantasies of conquest and escape. A shapeshifter, he is permeable to the histories of others, living and dead. Like <em>The Tiger\u2019s Wife</em>, this book is peopled by the casualties of empire: vanished children, displaced women and ghostly armies of the men who stood up for the right to call the territory their own:</p> <p><em>The doomed French rode up from the desert with their brilliant pennants flying.

It\u2019s interwoven with the tale of a single day in the life of Nora, a frontierswoman whose remote homestead is \u201cthe last known place before the page went blank\u201d. Nora is doing her best to get through the Arizona drought as she waits for her husband to return from town with water. She is at home with her young son, her paralysed mother-in-law and a fey servant girl who is convinced she has seen a strange beast prowling about the property in the night. Parched and beset, Nora dismisses this as an illusion \u2013 except that in this sun-scarred landscape what seems illusory is often most real.</p> <p>Nora has her own ghosts. \u201cThirty-seven years old and half-habited by the apparition of a child she had known for only five months\u201d, she talks constantly to the spirit of her daughter, lost to heatstroke as a baby, while regretting the failed ideals that brought her family west. Out of Nora\u2019s claustrophobia, her literal and metaphorical thirst \u2013 will she get a sip of water before the day is done? More importantly, will she find emotional release? \u2013 Obreht builds a narrative that is every bit as compelling as Lurie\u2019s, and just as full of revelations. Their parallel journeys into Arizona\u2019s inhospitable interior, \u201caway from any graspable fact of life\u201d, probe the cost of survival and the human yearning to belong. On every page gorgeously tinted images conjure the otherworldliness of this desert existence: mesas \u201cbanded over with ore and stuck about with newborn scrub\u201d; the fallen Alamo, \u201cwith its ruined steeples like the peaks cut off a mountainside\u201d; \u201ca wrecked-out church the colour of blood hidden among the black cedars\u201d; a cluster of ghostly settler children \u201cpeering over the bluff, bright as falling stars\u201d. And the camels, of course, rejoicing \u201cin the fresh air and open sky, roaring, jostling, belching incredibly, dust-rolling, butting necks along wide laterals\u201d. It\u2019s the west, but not as we know it.</p> <p>Nora and Lurie are set on a collision course: will they meet? Obreht\u2019s narrative skill here is part of the magic of <em>Inland</em>, which succeeds spectacularly at reinventing a well-worn genre and its tropes. There are no stereotypes in this western, only ferociously adroit writing that honours the true strangeness of reality in its search for the meaning of home.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Elizabeth Lowry\u2019s Dark Water is published by Riverrun.

Out of Nora\u2019s claustrophobia, her literal and metaphorical thirst \u2013 will she get a sip of water before the day is done? More importantly, will she find emotional release? \u2013 Obreht builds a narrative that is every bit as compelling as Lurie\u2019s, and just as full of revelations. Their parallel journeys into Arizona\u2019s inhospitable interior, \u201caway from any graspable fact of life\u201d, probe the cost of survival and the human yearning to belong. On every page gorgeously tinted images conjure the otherworldliness of this desert existence: mesas \u201cbanded over with ore and stuck about with newborn scrub\u201d; the fallen Alamo, \u201cwith its ruined steeples like the peaks cut off a mountainside\u201d; \u201ca wrecked-out church the colour of blood hidden among the black cedars\u201d; a cluster of ghostly settler children \u201cpeering over the bluff, bright as falling stars\u201d. And the camels, of course, rejoicing \u201cin the fresh air and open sky, roaring, jostling, belching incredibly, dust-rolling, butting necks along wide laterals\u201d. It\u2019s the west, but not as we know it. Nora and Lurie are set on a collision course: will they meet? Obreht\u2019s narrative skill here is part of the magic of Inland, which succeeds spectacularly at reinventing a well-worn genre and its tropes. There are no stereotypes in this western, only ferociously adroit writing that honours the true strangeness of reality in its search for the meaning of home. \u2022 Elizabeth Lowry\u2019s Dark Water is published by Riverrun.

That\u2019s exactly what the Ikea Symfonisk table lamp is.</p> <p>The new musical lamp, priced at \u00a3150, is one of a pair of new products in an interesting partnership between the Swedish furniture manufacturer Ikea and multi-room audio specialists Sonos.</p> <h2><strong>Setting it up</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"25b4b230a72952b34795e7fda3ca07c16e775438\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/25b4b230a72952b34795e7fda3ca07c16e775438/141_248_4650_2790/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ikea Symfonisk wifi lamp speaker review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Some assembly required: an E14 bulb (in the UK) and the top glass bowl.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The outside design and operation of the Symfonisk lamp is pure Ikea: assembly required. In truth that just means screwing your (not included) standard E14 bulb in the top, fitting the glass shade and plugging in the (included) power cord.</p> <p>From there it\u2019s all Sonos, which means setting up the speaker is a simple five-minute affair using the Sonos app on your phone or tablet. Tap add a new speaker, wait for it to find the lamp, press two buttons to confirm it\u2019s the right one and wait for it to update.</p> <p>If you\u2019ve never used a Sonos product before, adding your favourite music service is straightforward \u2013 including Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon Music or one of the 118 others. Then it can be controlled from the Sonos app, with one search for all your music sources. It works brilliantly.</p> <p>Alternatively you can use Apple\u2019s AirPlay 2 or Spotify Connect straight from the appropriate app. The only big one missing is Chromecast support.</p> <p>Note this is not a smart speaker and does not contain a microphone activated through voice commands.</p> <p>But it\u2019s also worth noting that Sonos has a long history of actively supporting its products through software updates and improvements, meaning that even older products aren\u2019t left behind as the technology changes. Ikea\u2019s Symfonisk system are Sonos on the inside, which means they will benefit from the long software and services support lifetime too.</p> <h2><strong>How it looks</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"deb0e80074ca157bc1813870e62b307cb7113ad3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/deb0e80074ca157bc1813870e62b307cb7113ad3/674_468_3560_2136/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ikea Symfonisk wifi lamp speaker review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The lamp will take an E14 bulb at up to 7W.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Apart from hole in the back for the ethernet cable and a set of three buttons controlling playback and volume in the saucer-like base, the lamp looks like a regular medium-sized table lamp. The main trunk is covered in a fabric mesh, while the glass bowl at the top looks like any other integrated lamp shade.</p> <p>And that\u2019s the point. More so than a speaker, the lamp simply blends in with the rest of your furniture. It is available in a grey and white, which matches similar colour schemes from Google, Apple, Amazon and many others. A bolder black and gold version is available, but you\u2019d probably need a pretty strong colour scheme for that to fit well into your furnishings.</p> <h2><strong>How it sounds</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"73dd6d6859f40b4e5813fbb0f68b9f906df5698f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/73dd6d6859f40b4e5813fbb0f68b9f906df5698f/0_154_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ikea Symfonisk wifi lamp speaker review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hit the play button in the base to start the tunes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Using the Symfonisk lamp is straightforward too. You set the music going via your phone, or via voice by linking Sonos to Alexa or Google Assistant. The buttons in the base mean you can quickly adjust the volume or pause it. Multi-room audio is simple too if you\u2019ve got other Sonos-compatible speakers. Just group select and hit play and the software will take care of the rest.</p> <p>The lamp part is decidedly manual, with the knob on the side simply being an on-off switch not a dimmer. You can fit a smart bulb, however, if you want more control such as white or colour changing, the ability to dim the lamp or turn it on or off remotely.</p> <p>The best bit is how it sounds. The speaker is surprisingly good for the money, with a nicely rounded sound that projects with a fairly wide, room-filling manner. It\u2019s got punchy bass, clarity in the highs with nicely balanced treble and sounds good even at low volume levels. It can\u2019t quite manage deep, thumping bass, but most will be very pleased. There\u2019s even an equaliser you can tweak if you prefer a bit more low-end or treble, and you can crank up the volume to quite uncomfortable levels if you need it.</p> <p>It sounds at least as good as Sonos\u2019s great original Play:1, which costs \u00a3149 without a lamp attached. You can even pair them for proper stereo separation, use them as part of a home cinema set up with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jun/27/sonos-beam-review-a-great-compact-jack-of-all-trades-upgrade-for-your-tv\">Sonos Beam</a> or similar, or use them with Sonos\u2019s Sub for deep, powerful bass \u2013 although that might seem overkill given the Sub costs \u00a3699 on its own.</p> <p>In fact the only thing I wish it had was a set of microphones for Alexa or Google Assistant, which would turn it into one of the best smart speakers able replace three devices in one. Some will see that as a blessing rather than a curse.</p> <h2><strong>Observations</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"02864bf068759930e8b52e3316b5dd0c957ddb2f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/02864bf068759930e8b52e3316b5dd0c957ddb2f/111_154_4817_2890/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ikea Symfonisk wifi lamp speaker review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The ethernet port is recessed into the back, but it\u2019ll connect just fine to your wifi or a Sonos wifi network broadcast by other speakers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>There\u2019s a cute little fabric Ikea Sonos tag at the back of the lamp</p></li> <li><p>There are four silicone feet under the lamp that prevent it vibrating the furniture it\u2019s sat on</p></li> </ul> <h2><strong>Price</strong></h2> <p>The Ikea Symfonisk table lamp speaker costs \u00a3150 in <a href=\"https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/p/symfonisk-table-lamp-with-wifi-speaker-white-70435160/\">white and grey</a> or <a href=\"https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/p/symfonisk-table-lamp-with-wifi-speaker-black-50357592/\">black and gold</a>.</p> <p>For comparison, the Symfonisk wifi bookshelf speaker costs <a href=\"https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/p/symfonisk-wifi-bookshelf-speaker-white-60435207/\">\u00a399</a>, the Sonos Play:1 speaker <a href=\"https://www.sonos.com/en-gb/shop/play1.html\">\u00a3149</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/feb/15/sonos-one-review-best-smart-speaker-audiophiles-amazon-alexa\">Sonos One</a> \u00a3199, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/29/sonos-play5-review-wireless-wifi-speaker-multiroom-music\">Sonos Play:5</a> <a href=\"https://www.sonos.com/en-gb/shop/play5.html\">\u00a3499</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jun/27/sonos-beam-review-a-great-compact-jack-of-all-trades-upgrade-for-your-tv\">Sonos Beam</a> <a href=\"https://www.sonos.com/en-gb/shop/beam.html\">\u00a3399</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Verdict</strong></h2> <p>On the surface Ikea and Sonos might sound like an odd mix, but the result of the pairing is something quite special.</p> <p>Taking Ikea\u2019s democratising design chops and adding Sonos\u2019s expertise in audio has produced a good looking lamp that sounds way better than it has any right to. It doesn\u2019t obviously look like a speaker or piece of technology.</p> <p>While \u00a3150 for a speaker isn\u2019t exactly cheap, for the calibre of wifi speaker built into the lamp it is a veritable bargain. Add to that the fact that it\u2019s built on Sonos\u2019s excellent multi-room control system, its wide support for basically every music service under the sun and its extensive history of longevity and updates. It means you can buy the Symfonisk in the knowledge it won\u2019t be left behind when the next big thing comes along.</p> <p>Of course, a lamp is a piece of furniture that has to fit in with your decor more than a simple speaker might, so its bulbous frosted glass and fabric styling might not be to everyone\u2019s taste.</p> <p>But if it is and you want add quality music and light to a room then the Symfonisk table lamp is genuinely delightful.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Pros:</strong> great sound, good looking, condenses two things into one, easy set up, Sonos control, wide support for music services, can be paired up, optional ethernet</p> <p><strong>Cons:</strong> design may not be to everyone\u2019s taste, base is quite large, no smart speaker mics, no Bluetooth or line in, no bulb included, no dimmer switch</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"766cbb1a6f37cecc6165600b89831b0739f82d0a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/766cbb1a6f37cecc6165600b89831b0739f82d0a/496_503_3721_2233/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ikea Symfonisk wifi lamp speaker review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The wifi lamp next to the bookshelf speaker, the first of the new products from the tie up between Ikea and Sonos.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Other reviews</h2> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jun/27/sonos-beam-review-a-great-compact-jack-of-all-trades-upgrade-for-your-tv\">Sonos Beam review: a great, compact, jack-of-all-trades upgrade for your TV</a></strong></p></li> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/29/sonos-play5-review-wireless-wifi-speaker-multiroom-music\">Sonos Play:5 review: one of the best wireless speakers money can buy</a></strong></p></li> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/feb/15/sonos-one-review-best-smart-speaker-audiophiles-amazon-alexa\">Sonos One review: the best smart speaker for audiophiles</a></strong></p></li> </ul>",

Alternatively you can use Apple\u2019s AirPlay 2 or Spotify Connect straight from the appropriate app. The only big one missing is Chromecast support. Note this is not a smart speaker and does not contain a microphone activated through voice commands. But it\u2019s also worth noting that Sonos has a long history of actively supporting its products through software updates and improvements, meaning that even older products aren\u2019t left behind as the technology changes. Ikea\u2019s Symfonisk system are Sonos on the inside, which means they will benefit from the long software and services support lifetime too. How it looks Apart from hole in the back for the ethernet cable and a set of three buttons controlling playback and volume in the saucer-like base, the lamp looks like a regular medium-sized table lamp. The main trunk is covered in a fabric mesh, while the glass bowl at the top looks like any other integrated lamp shade. And that\u2019s the point. More so than a speaker, the lamp simply blends in with the rest of your furniture. It is available in a grey and white, which matches similar colour schemes from Google, Apple, Amazon and many others. A bolder black and gold version is available, but you\u2019d probably need a pretty strong colour scheme for that to fit well into your furnishings. How it sounds Using the Symfonisk lamp is straightforward too. You set the music going via your phone, or via voice by linking Sonos to Alexa or Google Assistant. The buttons in the base mean you can quickly adjust the volume or pause it. Multi-room audio is simple too if you\u2019ve got other Sonos-compatible speakers. Just group select and hit play and the software will take care of the rest. The lamp part is decidedly manual, with the knob on the side simply being an on-off switch not a dimmer. You can fit a smart bulb, however, if you want more control such as white or colour changing, the ability to dim the lamp or turn it on or off remotely. The best bit is how it sounds. The speaker is surprisingly good for the money, with a nicely rounded sound that projects with a fairly wide, room-filling manner. It\u2019s got punchy bass, clarity in the highs with nicely balanced treble and sounds good even at low volume levels. It can\u2019t quite manage deep, thumping bass, but most will be very pleased. There\u2019s even an equaliser you can tweak if you prefer a bit more low-end or treble, and you can crank up the volume to quite uncomfortable levels if you need it. It sounds at least as good as Sonos\u2019s great original Play:1, which costs \u00a3149 without a lamp attached. You can even pair them for proper stereo separation, use them as part of a home cinema set up with the Sonos Beam or similar, or use them with Sonos\u2019s Sub for deep, powerful bass \u2013 although that might seem overkill given the Sub costs \u00a3699 on its own. In fact the only thing I wish it had was a set of microphones for Alexa or Google Assistant, which would turn it into one of the best smart speakers able replace three devices in one. Some will see that as a blessing rather than a curse. Observations There\u2019s a cute little fabric Ikea Sonos tag at the back of the lamp There are four silicone feet under the lamp that prevent it vibrating the furniture it\u2019s sat on Price The Ikea Symfonisk table lamp speaker costs \u00a3150 in white and grey or black and gold. For comparison, the Symfonisk wifi bookshelf speaker costs \u00a399, the Sonos Play:1 speaker \u00a3149, the Sonos One \u00a3199, the Sonos Play:5 \u00a3499 and Sonos Beam \u00a3399. Verdict On the surface Ikea and Sonos might sound like an odd mix, but the result of the pairing is something quite special. Taking Ikea\u2019s democratising design chops and adding Sonos\u2019s expertise in audio has produced a good looking lamp that sounds way better than it has any right to. It doesn\u2019t obviously look like a speaker or piece of technology. While \u00a3150 for a speaker isn\u2019t exactly cheap, for the calibre of wifi speaker built into the lamp it is a veritable bargain. Add to that the fact that it\u2019s built on Sonos\u2019s excellent multi-room control system, its wide support for basically every music service under the sun and its extensive history of longevity and updates. It means you can buy the Symfonisk in the knowledge it won\u2019t be left behind when the next big thing comes along. Of course, a lamp is a piece of furniture that has to fit in with your decor more than a simple speaker might, so its bulbous frosted glass and fabric styling might not be to everyone\u2019s taste. But if it is and you want add quality music and light to a room then the Symfonisk table lamp is genuinely delightful. Pros: great sound, good looking, condenses two things into one, easy set up, Sonos control, wide support for music services, can be paired up, optional ethernet Cons: design may not be to everyone\u2019s taste, base is quite large, no smart speaker mics, no Bluetooth or line in, no bulb included, no dimmer switch Other reviews Sonos Beam review: a great, compact, jack-of-all-trades upgrade for your TV Sonos Play:5 review: one of the best wireless speakers money can buy Sonos One review: the best smart speaker for audiophiles",

They pay high rents for flimsy shacks on land owned by the government and effectively squatted on by landlords. They have no services and the only taxation comes in the form of protection money demanded by police and gangs. Each day is a struggle to scrape together enough money and food to reach the next.</p>\n    <p>Electricity, clean water, toilets, healthcare and schools are either non-existent or not available to all residents. At any one time, 50% of Kibera's 15- to 25-year-old women are pregnant. Abortion is illegal and contraception scarce. Rape and child sex abuse is endemic. Abuse of drink and drugs is rife. Food is cheap but unhealthy \u2013 fizzy drinks are easier to get than clean water.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Life in Kibera is a harsh and grinding reality. Growing up as a disempowered young person makes it so easy to be angry. I saw many organisations parachute into my community with grand plans. I watched as each of their programmes somehow went astray. I\u2019ll always remember one aid group that came in and built a public latrine. After they left, a neighbour shacked up inside the structure and declared it his home.

      "bodyText": "The future is shining in Kenya. By many measures, life is better than it has ever been. A decade of steady economic growth has made Kenya a rising middle-income country. Reports on the health and education of the population show indicators are marching upwards. On the streets, a sense of hope and hustle prevails. This is progress. However, there is a rebellion brewing. As rural to urban migration continues to push more young people into slums, only to be met with despair, an uprising looms. I say this not as an alarmist, but as an activist. In the cities, a growing majority of Kenyans are struggling to realise the promise of urban life. The World Bank estimates that 56% of Kenya\u2019s urban population live in slums, amounting to more than 4 million people. As urbanisation pushes the economy upwards, the growing slum problem cannot be overlooked. Too many poor families are leaving their village for the city, only to find their dream of urban life was an illusion. This is how my life began three decades ago. I was born in rural Kenya during a long drought. It drove my family to the city, drawn by the \u201cbright lights of opportunity\u201d. Arriving in Nairobi, uneducated and unskilled, my family struggled to survive. From the age of two, I grew up in Kibera slum, the largest in Africa. Life in Kibera is a harsh and grinding reality.

      "bodyText": "How young is too young to start wearing makeup? That\u2019s the question being asked in the beauty world after John Lewis and Mac cosmetics cancelled a \u201cback-to-school mini masterclass\u201d on makeup for children as young as 12, after attracting criticism. \u201cI get asked this question all the time,\u201d says the beauty writer Sali Hughes, who let her sons play with makeup from 18 months. \u201cTo me, that\u2019s the wrong question. It\u2019s about how you are framing makeup.\u201d Lucy Rycroft-Smith, a teacher and author of The Equal Classroom, has argued that secondary schools should lift makeup bans, but would not have taken her daughters, aged 10 and 13, to the Mac event. \u201cOne hundred per cent not,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you want to get ready for school, do some learning.\u201d Rycroft-Smith started wearing makeup at 12 or 13. She has always allowed her daughters to play with her makeup (\u201ca function of it being cheap\u201d). \u201cBut I have told them from a young age that makeup is bound up with patriarchal power,\u201d she says. When her daughter puts on lipstick to go out and asks how she looks: \u201cThere is always a discussion about how people react to you and how do you want them to react. What is it you want them to see?\u201d Hani Sidow, 23, author of the beauty guide Insta-glam, is against makeup for primary-school children. At 12, she put Vaseline on her lips and lashes. By 14 she progressed to mascara \u201cand one dot of foundation\u201d under her eyes. Then came pencil and liquid liners, concealer, foundation and, finally, three years ago, face powder. \u201cEven when you\u2019re 12, I think there\u2019s nothing wrong with it. If someone feels they are ready to express themselves, there shouldn\u2019t be a problem with it,\u201d she says. Makeup influencer Romanie-Jade Tulloch, from Nottingham, creates spectacularly surreal faces with makeup. At 20, she is closer to Mac and John Lewis\u2019s target audience, but firm about the need to specify age limits. She didn\u2019t wear makeup until she was 14, abiding by her mother\u2019s rules (apart from when she sneaked into her room to practise with eyeliner). \u201cI\u2019ve turned my face into anything with makeup,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s such a cool thing to do. But I didn\u2019t feel I had to wear makeup. The way I was brought up taught me I didn\u2019t have to change myself.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Universities will be paid to improve outcomes even when they fail performance metrics in the areas of attrition rates, graduate employment, student satisfaction and participation of equity groups under a scheme endorsed by the Morrison government. On Wednesday the education minister, Dan Tehan, released a review of performance funding, which recommended that a pool of $80m of at-risk funding in 2020 increase over time in line with national population increases. Despite Tehan trumpeting the scheme\u2019s ability to deliver \u201cincentives for performance and transparency\u201d, the review shows that an \u201cincremental\u201d approach will mean even the worst-performing university will receive 75% of their at-risk funding. And even when universities fail to achieve their performance metrics, the panel said the unallocated funding \u201cshould be provided to universities under conditions negotiated between the Department of Education and the university\u201d. Tehan told reporters in Wollongong the model was \u201cnot a carrot and stick\u201d because universities would be rewarded for performing well and would receive \u201ca financial payment to help improve\u201d performance in other areas. Tehan denied that churning at-risk funding back to failing universities defeated the purpose of a performance funding system. He said the \u201cuniquely Australian\u201d system would mean the universities which fell short would \u201cgive up a tiny bit of autonomy where they\u2019re not performing as well as they otherwise would be\u201d. The review, conducted by a panel of vice-chancellors led by chair Paul Wellings of the University of Wollongong, called for a cumulative approach so that the pool of at-risk funding grows from 2021 to 7.5% of universities\u2019 total funding. The panel called for four performance metrics: Student success, as measured by first-year attrition rates but accounting for shifts into vocational education; Participation by Indigenous, low socio-economic status, and regional and remote students; Graduate outcomes, as measured by longer-term graduate employment rates for domestic bachelor students; and Student experience, as measured by student surveys of teaching quality. Graduate outcomes would be measured based on an individual university\u2019s improvement on the previous year, while student success would control for other factors such as demographics and courses. The panel said a portion of at-risk funding should be allocated for each metric, to prevent a \u201csevere\u201d and \u201cunfair\u201d all-or-nothing approach. It left open the possibility that universities could be allowed to set a greater weight for each metric. \u201cEach of the four measures should allocate funding based on an incremental approach,\u201d it said, meaning that falling short of identified targets in each area would only result in partial loss of funding. The panel modelled the impact of the new funding model with \u201cindicative\u201d data, finding that in 2020: 16 universities would receive more than 90% of their at-risk funding; 31 universities would receive more than 80%; and the worst-performing university would still receive 75%. Tehan said the framework was \u201can excellent one\u201d and he had agreed \u201ca way forward on performance based funding\u201d with the sector, although he hoped to finalise sign-off by the end of the month. Andrew Norton, the higher education program director at Grattan Institute, said he opposed performance funding and the decision to grow the at-risk pool. \u201cAs a consequence, universities will be even more cautious about expanding their bases because the funding is not guaranteed \u2013 it increases the risk that student places will fall,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Norton questioned the wisdom of basing the system on indicators out of universities\u2019 control, such as employment results. \u201cRatcheting up the improvement requirements will be the hard part \u2026 There will often be quite limited levers to pull, the question is what universities can do in practical terms.\u201d The shadow education minister, Tanya Plibersek, said Labor would consider the proposal and was not against \u201clinking some funding to performance\u201d in principle. \u201cBut it does nothing to change the fact the Liberals have restricted access to uni, locking out thousands of Australians, especially in the suburbs and the regions.\u201d The Greens education spokeswoman, Mehreen Faruqi, said the performance measures were \u201cmisguided\u201d, citing graduate employment \u201cas a measure of success [which] betrays the purpose of our public universities\u201d. \u201cWe cannot allow their collegial, public-focused mission to be displaced by the Liberals\u2019 vision of unis as just factories for the workforce.\u201d",

Those systems and tools were developed in the EU for very good reason. They were very good. We had just signed up to biometric sharing. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/aug/07/no-deal-brexit-would-harm-uk-security-senior-officer-warns\">In a no-deal we\u2019d lose all that</a>. We\u2019d have to renegotiate it.\u201d</p> \n<p>Basu has told the Guardian that the police and security services are no longer enough to defeat violent extremism and the UK must instead improve community cohesion, social mobility and education. The Scotland Yard assistant commissioner said up to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/aug/06/counter-terrorism-chief-calls-for-greater-social-inclusion\">80% of those who wanted to attack the UK were British-born or raised</a>. Both Islamist and extreme rightwing terrorists have continued to recruit Britons, despite efforts to thwart them, with violent nationalism fuelled by the Brexit vote. \u201cI want good academics, good sociologists, good criminologists \u2026 to be telling us exactly why that is. It might be everything from high anxiety, to lack of confidence, lack of education, things that may have happened to them when they are young, bullying, racism, bigotry, lack of opportunity, early experiences with law enforcement even, domestic violence.\u201d</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>\u2018Oppressive language is violence\u2019 \u2013 </strong>Toni Morrison, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/aug/06/toni-morrison-author-and-pulitzer-winner-dies-aged-88\">chronicled the African American experience in fiction over five decades</a>, has died aged 88. Morrison first came to prominence as an acclaimed editor and then with novels such as The Bluest Eye, Song of Solomon and Beloved. Her career garnered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/aug/06/toni-morrison-obituary\">honours including the Pulitzer and Nobel prizes</a>, the L\u00e9gion d\u2019Honneur and a Presidential Medal of Freedom presented to her in 2012 by her friend Barack Obama.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"2ffe9b27-091f-4ad6-b337-94e757d61d4e\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/15MMmgwl1V4?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In words that resonate in these times, Morrison in her 1993 Nobel acceptance speech spelled out the dangers of \u201coppressive language [that] does more than represent violence; it is violence; does more than represent the limits of knowledge; it limits knowledge\u201d.

The energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie predicts that by 2024, annual home battery installations across Europe could total more than 500MW, the equivalent of building a new gas-fired power plant every year. But it will be more difficult for UK households to access the potential of low-cost renewable energy after a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/aug/06/uk-risks-losing-out-europe-home-battery-boom-report-warns\">VAT increase on solar batteries installed from October</a> \u2013 as well as Britain\u2019s \u201cunfavourable\u201d policy framework\u201d, says the report. The government has blamed EU rules for the VAT change, a claim disputed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/26/brexit-green-policies-vat-solar-batteries\">Molly Scott Cato, a Green MEP for South West England</a>.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>\u2018Tax trap\u2019 tamed \u2013 </strong>NHS pension rules blamed for deterring senior doctors and nurses from working additional shifts for fear of hefty tax bills are to be overhauled. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, said the move would ensure senior clinicians in England and Wales fully benefited from any extra work they took on. However, some hospital doctors are warning the NHS is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/aug/07/tax-trap-pension-rules-to-change-in-effort-to-halt-nhs-crisis\">already facing \u201ca full-blown winter meltdown\u201d</a> as a result of the crisis caused by the pension rules. Rule changes introduced in 2016 meant rising numbers of consultants and other senior staff were facing unexpected tax bills linked to the value of their pensions. Operations and clinics were cancelled as NHS senior staff withdrew from working extra shifts that would put them in the pension penalty zone.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Stop it now \u2013 </strong>Scientists have come up with a defence against the menace of food-snatching seagulls: stare them out. Madeleine Goumas, a postgraduate researcher at Exeter University, ventured to Falmouth, St Ives, Newquay and other popular seaside spots. She placed a sealed bag of chips about an arm\u2019s length away and timed when the seagulls swooped. According to her study in Biology Letters, they were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/aug/07/stare-seagulls-out-to-save-your-snacks-researcher-says\">less likely to approach food when she locked eyes with them</a>. Dr Viola Ross-Smith, at the British Trust for Ornithology, backs this up based on years of her own work on seagulls. \u201cThey have dive-bombed me, screamed at me, regurgitated and defecated. It\u2019s not glamorous work,\u201d she said. \u201cBut in my experience, if you look at the gulls, they either stay on the ground and look back at you or back off.\u201d Unclear whether it also works on rats, which have been recorded <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/07/japanese-food-store-closes-after-videos-of-rats-browsing-its-shelves-go-viral\">grazing the shelves of a Japanese grocer</a> \u2013 leading to the store shutting its doors.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"39792c69-2d6d-417e-a444-fc4c4d2e4bec\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BkpV_fCeuIE?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>Today in Focus podcast: Cancer town</h2> \n<p>In Reserve, Louisiana, Oliver Laughland hears how a community is fighting for the right to a safe environment for their children, who face a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/audio/2019/aug/07/cancer-town-life-in-the-shadow-of-a-chemical-plant-podcast\">risk of cancer 50 times higher than the national average</a>.

      "bodyText": "Top story: Call to tackle social causes of extremism Hello, Warren Murray bringing you the stories that count this morning. The UK\u2019s safety and security would suffer from a no-deal Brexit with the loss of key crime-fighting tools \u2013 and no amount of planning and preparation can erase the risk, Neil Basu, Britain\u2019s head of counter-terrorism, has warned. \u201cWe can make them [the damaging effects] less, but they would be slower systems. Those systems and tools were developed in the EU for very good reason. They were very good. We had just signed up to biometric sharing. In a no-deal we\u2019d lose all that. We\u2019d have to renegotiate it.\u201d Basu has told the Guardian that the police and security services are no longer enough to defeat violent extremism and the UK must instead improve community cohesion, social mobility and education. The Scotland Yard assistant commissioner said up to 80% of those who wanted to attack the UK were British-born or raised. Both Islamist and extreme rightwing terrorists have continued to recruit Britons, despite efforts to thwart them, with violent nationalism fuelled by the Brexit vote. \u201cI want good academics, good sociologists, good criminologists \u2026 to be telling us exactly why that is. It might be everything from high anxiety, to lack of confidence, lack of education, things that may have happened to them when they are young, bullying, racism, bigotry, lack of opportunity, early experiences with law enforcement even, domestic violence.\u201d * * * \u2018Oppressive language is violence\u2019 \u2013 Toni Morrison, who chronicled the African American experience in fiction over five decades, has died aged 88. Morrison first came to prominence as an acclaimed editor and then with novels such as The Bluest Eye, Song of Solomon and Beloved. Her career garnered honours including the Pulitzer and Nobel prizes, the L\u00e9gion d\u2019Honneur and a Presidential Medal of Freedom presented to her in 2012 by her friend Barack Obama. In words that resonate in these times, Morrison in her 1993 Nobel acceptance speech spelled out the dangers of \u201coppressive language [that] does more than represent violence; it is violence; does more than represent the limits of knowledge; it limits knowledge\u201d. Leading authors have offered tributes: among them, Ben Okri, Alice Walker and Bonnie Greer, the latter writing: \u201cLike her equal, Whitman, she cannot be imitated.\u201d * * * Midweek catch-up &gt; Madagascar police have found a body believed to be that of a Cambridge University student who fell from a plane. The pilot has said Alana Cutland, 19, opened the door and jumped out. It has been reported she was unwell. &gt; Canadian police say they have found items on a river bank in Manitoba that are \u201cdirectly linked\u201d to Kam McLeod, 19, and Bryer Schmegelsky, the suspects in a triple murder case who have been on the run for nearly three weeks. &gt; The founder of the extremist 8chan website, where mass shootings are glorified, has lashed out over its banning by internet hosts. It is run by Jim Watkins, a US military veteran and sometime internet pornographer who lives in the Philippines. &gt; The Philippines has declared a national epidemic of dengue fever after more than 600 deaths this year. The country has recorded 146,062 cases from January to July. &gt; No more sniggering over suggestive beer names and retro images of buxom women at the Great British Beer Festival. The Campaign for Real Ale (Camra) has banned them from this year \u2013 because women drink beer too and, well, this is 2019. * * * Britain unplugged \u2013 The UK risks being left behind in Europe\u2019s home battery boom because of a tax hike on solar battery systems, according to a report. The energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie predicts that by 2024, annual home battery installations across Europe could total more than 500MW, the equivalent of building a new gas-fired power plant every year. But it will be more difficult for UK households to access the potential of low-cost renewable energy after a VAT increase on solar batteries installed from October \u2013 as well as Britain\u2019s \u201cunfavourable\u201d policy framework\u201d, says the report. The government has blamed EU rules for the VAT change, a claim disputed by Molly Scott Cato, a Green MEP for South West England. * * * \u2018Tax trap\u2019 tamed \u2013 NHS pension rules blamed for deterring senior doctors and nurses from working additional shifts for fear of hefty tax bills are to be overhauled. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, said the move would ensure senior clinicians in England and Wales fully benefited from any extra work they took on. However, some hospital doctors are warning the NHS is already facing \u201ca full-blown winter meltdown\u201d as a result of the crisis caused by the pension rules. Rule changes introduced in 2016 meant rising numbers of consultants and other senior staff were facing unexpected tax bills linked to the value of their pensions. Operations and clinics were cancelled as NHS senior staff withdrew from working extra shifts that would put them in the pension penalty zone. * * * Stop it now \u2013 Scientists have come up with a defence against the menace of food-snatching seagulls: stare them out. Madeleine Goumas, a postgraduate researcher at Exeter University, ventured to Falmouth, St Ives, Newquay and other popular seaside spots. She placed a sealed bag of chips about an arm\u2019s length away and timed when the seagulls swooped. According to her study in Biology Letters, they were less likely to approach food when she locked eyes with them. Dr Viola Ross-Smith, at the British Trust for Ornithology, backs this up based on years of her own work on seagulls. \u201cThey have dive-bombed me, screamed at me, regurgitated and defecated. It\u2019s not glamorous work,\u201d she said. \u201cBut in my experience, if you look at the gulls, they either stay on the ground and look back at you or back off.\u201d Unclear whether it also works on rats, which have been recorded grazing the shelves of a Japanese grocer \u2013 leading to the store shutting its doors. Today in Focus podcast: Cancer town In Reserve, Louisiana, Oliver Laughland hears how a community is fighting for the right to a safe environment for their children, who face a risk of cancer 50 times higher than the national average. Plus Helen Pidd on the battle to save the dam at Whaley Bridge in Derbyshire. Lunchtime read: \u2018The plane is too heavy\u2019 Booking a cheap flight can seem a good idea. But reality brings surprises. Such as one easyJet customer\u2019s tweet claiming to show a woman on a flight from London to Geneva sitting on a row of seats without backs. EasyJet pointed out that no one had actually sat in the damaged seat during the flight. However, plenty of passengers have their own nightmareish tales of low-cost flights \u2026 Sport Vic Marks warns that England\u2019s bid to lift the gloom of the first Ashes Test loss will struggle further through a lack of in-form replacements. Perhaps Jofra Archer could ably fill a seamer\u2019s spot and knock up a few runs as a bonus. Meanwhile, Australia coach Justin Langer is convinced the squad has a cunning plan which with to wrap up the series, possibly involving winning further Test matches. Tottenham are preparing a \u20ac70m (\u00a364.4m) bid to buy the talented but inconsistent Paulo Dybala from Juventus. And speaking of Italian football\u2019s \u201cOld Lady\u201d, Moise Kean speaks of his new start at Everton and the racist taunts he endured at Cagliari. Ben Te\u2019o is a surprise omission from the England squad preparing to face Wales on Sunday, casting doubt on his place at the World Cup. The Tour de Pologne was suspended as riders paid tribute to Bjorg Lambrecht, who died after a crash on Monday. And the first jockey to win a race in Britain wearing a hijab is still taking in all the attention. Business The prospect of a prolonged US-China trade war kept Asian markets in the red overnight despite signs that Beijing was trying to keep the yuan higher in the wake of accusations that it weaponising its currency. Donald Trump also upped the ante by saying US farmers, who have been hit hard by retaliatory Chinese tariffs on their produce, could always rely on him to protect them against Beijing. The FTSE100 is set to fall a fraction at the resumption of trading this morning while the pound was flat at $1.216 and \u20ac1.085. The papers The Guardian dedicates about two-thirds of its front page to a magnificent portrait of Toni Morrison, whom the paper pays tribute to.

      "bodyText": "Granada is dominated by its mighty Moorish fortress, the Alhambra. Book ahead and visit early, at its least-crowded, and then spend the afternoon meandering the narrow streets and plazas of the old town \u2013 the Albaic\u00edn. Stay in this area at the 16th-century Santa Isabel La Real, with its Alhambra views, (doubles from \u20ac95 B&amp;B, parking available). On day two, take in the Alhambra\u2019s Nasrid palaces, Generalife and the Alcazaba before driving north-west through rolling olive country to picturesque Priego de C\u00f3rdoba (N-432 &amp; A-339, 76km). The town is a restful place to be, and feels like the essence of Andaluc\u00eda; its Barrio de la Villa is a labyrinth of fountains, churches, geraniums, with castle and panoramic views. Take all that in while staying at quaint Hotel Zahor\u00ed (double from \u20ac55 B&amp;B). Day three and it\u2019s time to head north-east to the twin world heritage cities of Baeza and \u00dabeda, both miniature gems (and renovated in the Renaissance period) designed to keep Moors, then Christians, then Moors at bay, and only 9km apart. (A-333 and Autov\u00eda del Olivar A-316, 126km). Break the journey in Ja\u00e9n to tour Castilla de Santa Catalina and visit the well-preserved Arab Baths. In Baeza, be sure to walk the Calle de San Pablo, take in the sweeping views from Paseo de las Murallas, and eat around the Plaza de la Constituci\u00f3n. \u00dabeda is famous for ceramics: visit Alfarar\u00eda Tito on Calle Valencia, a street also blessed with several delis selling fine olive oils. Both cities are full of architectural treasures, so allow two nights. Stay in Baeza at Hotel Puerta de la Luna (doubles from \u20ac73, room-only) or drive onto \u00dabeda and Palacio de la Rambla with its fine patio and intricately carved masonry (doubles from \u20ac132 B&amp;B) or Santa Mar\u00eda de \u00dabeda (doubles from \u20ac85 B&amp;B). The short drive to Cazorla marks the start of day five. It\u2019s the southern gateway to the Sierras of Cazorla, Segura and Las Villas, the largest reserve in Spain (south-east on A315 and A319, 45km, 45mins). Stay a night at Casa Rural Plaza de Santa Maria (doubles from \u20ac50 B&amp;B), beside the tourism office by a ruined church and cafes, and the start of multiple well-marked walking trails (from 3km to 20km long) \u2013 with magnificent views of Castillo de la Yedra. On day six drive the spectacular route (A-319, 17km) up and over mountains into the dappled valley of the Guadalquivir River, passing La Iruela (with its castle on a crag), and down into a tranquil enclosed world, thick with birds, smelling of pine, dominated by the wide, clear, burbling river. Allow four days here as there\u2019s so much to explore. The valley is just under 60km long. Most trails, campsites, hotels, and adventure tour operators are concentrated in the southern third. Be sure to visit Restaurante El Taxidermista (in open woodland setting, 3km south of Torre del Vinagre) and the Museo Etnogr\u00e1fico de Artes y Costumbres Populares del Parque Natural. Adventure tour companies in Arroyo Fr\u00edo offer riding, hiking and off-road 4x4 excursions, and trips to the swimming holes around Coto R\u00edos. Stay at Hotel Coto del Valle de Cazorla (doubles from \u20ac95, room-only), where wild boar often forage at dusk. Head north to kayak on the reservoir at El Tranco and for the best views in the park from the peak of Yelmo (1,809 metres). Stay at the lovely Camping Rural El Robledo (pitches \u20ac6 including car, or double cabins from \u20ac50-\u20ac60), set in pines, 10 minutes south of arguably the park\u2019s most spectacular village, Segura de la Sierra. Day 10 offers the chance to explore the villages at the very south of the park: Roman ruins at Bru\u00f1el, the Santuario de Tiscar and the La Cueva del Agua nearby, cave paintings near Quesada. There are various routes (scenic or faster), so ask at a tourist office. Afterwards go via the A-315 (95km) or A-401 (130km) to Guadix On day 11 see Guadix on the Altiplano de Granada, which has been home to cave-dwellers for 1,000 years. Make time to explore the Barrio de las Cuevas and the museum Museo de Alfarer\u00eda Cueva La Alcazaba and stay in a well-appointed modern one, such as Casas Cueva del T\u00edo Tobas in Alcudia de Guadix (doubles from \u20ac76 B&amp;B). Day 12: The drive from Guadix to Almer\u00eda (A-92, 113km, around 1 hour) passes through the pink and orange peaks and ravines of spaghetti western country, the Tabernas Desert, and several theme parks recalling the glory days of Sergio Leone\u2019s spaghetti westerns.

Although the bird\u2019s diet is unknown, Scofield noted most parrots today are vegetarian.</p> <p>\u201cBut as animals get larger, they become predatory,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was so large it would have required a considerable amount of calories per day.\u201d</p> <p>Scofield said there are other examples of omnivorous New Zealand parrots that eat seabirds.</p> <p>Ecosystems on islands frequently produce large, unusual, often flightless birds \u2013 for example, the kiwi of New Zealand and the dodo of Mauritius.

      "bodyText": "Fossils of the largest parrot ever recorded have been found in New Zealand. Estimated to have weighed about 7kg (1.1st), it would have been more than twice as heavy as the k\u0101k\u0101po, previously the largest known parrot. Palaeontologists have named the new species Heracles inexpectatus to reflect its unusual size and strength and the unexpected nature of the discovery. Prof Trevor Worthy of Flinders University in Australia, the lead author of the research published in the journal Biology Letters, said: \u201cOnce we decided it was something new and interesting, the challenge was to figure out what family it was from. \u201cBecause no giant parrots have been found previously, parrots were not on our radar \u2013 thus it took some time to differentiate all other birds essentially from parrots to conclude that the unique suite of characters was definitive of a parrot.\u201d Paul Scofield, a senior curator of natural history at Canterbury Museum, said the fossil had been excavated in 2008, and initially the team had thought the bones were part of a giant eagle. The bones, which will go on display at an exhibition in November, were found in a fossil deposit from the early Miocene epoch, about 19m years ago, near Saint Bathans in Central Otago, New Zealand. Although the area is now very cold and known for its skiing, Scofield said the climate at the time meant the parrot would have lived near a giant lake in a diverse subtropical forest. \u201cBack then, it was a subtropical environment quite similar to northern New South Wales, and even had similar vegetation,\u201d Scofield said. He said the parrot\u2019s weight meant there was a possibility it was flightless. Although the bird\u2019s diet is unknown, Scofield noted most parrots today are vegetarian. \u201cBut as animals get larger, they become predatory,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was so large it would have required a considerable amount of calories per day.\u201d Scofield said there are other examples of omnivorous New Zealand parrots that eat seabirds. Ecosystems on islands frequently produce large, unusual, often flightless birds \u2013 for example, the kiwi of New Zealand and the dodo of Mauritius. New Zealand has produced a particularly large number of such species due to its large size, complex ecosystem and lack of predators. Daniel Field, an avian palaeontologist at the University of Cambridge, who was not involved in the research, said: \u201cIt has to do with arriving in a place where there are no terrestrial predators. \u201cUnfortunately, that can lead to animals becoming susceptible to extinction in the event that terrestrial predators are introduced or evolved. It\u2019s a tantalising finding and we\u2019d love to know more about these extinct birds. I hope they find more remains in the future.\u201d Worthy\u2019s team is planning to study songbirds from the same period. \u201cThere remain several groups of birds from the Saint Bathans Fauna to describe and reveal to the world, notably what were the songbirds we had back then \u2013 do they help reveal the origins of the modern endemic songbirds, or do they show closer relationships to things from Australia?\u201d he said.",

Ferguson moved to the US in 1993, a year after he stopped drinking, having been talent-spotted by an LA agent at the fringe. He had his first major hit playing, ironically, an archetypal English toff in the ABC sitcom The Drew Carey Show, but he had already enjoyed considerable success in the UK, filming a sketch series with the BBC. His memoir suggests, however, that the move gave him a clean slate. \u201cNobody in Hollywood cared if I\u2019d been a drunk or from the wrong social background,\u201d he writes.</p> <p>Having grown up in the new town of Cumbernauld, near Glasgow, Ferguson happily admits to a residual resentment about cliched reactions to his accent, but insists: \u201cI don\u2019t have that visceral barricade anger I had when I was 24. What I feel about class is that it robs everybody. A class structure that promotes people into positions they are not capable of is a disservice to everybody.\u201d</p> <p>It was anger that propelled his fondly remembered character Bing Hitler, a furious folk singer who eulogised his hatred for worms and the world in general from the stage of the Glasgow Pavilion in the mid-1980s. Would Bing Hitler survive today? \u201cI think it would be fine. It was the name of a Scottish folk singer \u2013 that was the joke. The difference was I was angry at everything, but it wasn\u2019t particularly cutting edge. One of the main things you get asked about if you work in humour is, \u2018In this politically correct climate, do you find it frustrating what you can and can\u2019t say?\u2019\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-m4wkYWEK4c\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-m4wkYWEK4c?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Watch Ferguson performing as Bing Hitler in 1987. </figcaption> </figure>   <p>I worry that he\u2019s about to embark on an anti-millennial moan, but Ferguson is too nuanced for that. \u201cAs you get older, there\u2019s a temptation to think things were better when you were younger \u2013 and things weren\u2019t better when I was younger. I like the way kids are now. I think they\u2019re interesting. They\u2019re saying: \u2018Let\u2019s not be shit to anyone because they\u2019re different.\u2019 They\u2019re kind.\u201d</p> <p>He sees this most in Glasgow, which has changed \u201cso much for the better\u201d since he left nearly three decades ago. He sounds quite bamboozled by the difference \u2013 his doting taxi-driver was telling him how great it was to see gay couples holding hands. Even seated, Ferguson is a big presence, but he has mellowed \u2013 or to be accurate, sobered \u2013 since Bing and his early years in the US when he grumbled about Scots not celebrating the successes of their brethren overseas. \u201cI thought I was hot shit,\u201d he says, \u201cfor getting a big-timey American TV show with my own name on it.\u201d</p> <p>He seems far more aware of his inner workings than your average west of Scotland male, though it\u2019s hard to divine how much of that is recovery and how much prolonged exposure to Californian culture. Even so, it is clear that this interviewer doesn\u2019t relish being interviewed. What if he had stayed in the UK? Would you have been like Peter Capaldi? (The pair played in a punk band in the early 80s) \u201cPeter\u2019s a very good actor,\u201d says Ferguson quickly. \u201cI don\u2019t know how it would have gone. I like to think I would have become a beloved TV detective, but the worlds of \u2018if\u2019 are legion.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a stretch to imagine Ferguson fronting up a Glasgow version of Foyle\u2019s War. His brain seems far too busy, his instincts too curious, and in that sense The Late Late Show must have suited him. But it\u2019s hard to overestimate the relentless grind of hosting an hour-long daily show. \u201cYou start looking for ways to entertain yourself,\u201d he says. \u201cGuests would come back again and again and again, so you both have to find something to talk about. That becomes a thing.\u201d</p> <p>He accepts that the Trump era has radically changed the late night landscape, ushering in a far more political form of comedy. \u201cI don\u2019t know how I would be now, because to be non-political would be seen as political. If I\u2019m honest, what really happened with me and Late Night was that I was having a great time but I got bored and I was ready to go.\u201d</p> <p>Ferguson is reluctant to take a position on Trump, or Brexit, or indeed Scottish independence, but it doesn\u2019t come across as coy when he explains that he doesn\u2019t want to alienate people for one very straightforward reason: it might stop them asking him for help. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you the number of people who have come up to me [since the Spears monologue] and said, \u2018I got that.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>In 2019, it\u2019s not uncommon to hear celebrities talk openly about their struggles with addiction, but Ferguson got sober in 1992, a lifetime ago in terms of public acceptance. As you would expect, he welcomes more openness about mental health problems, but with caveats: \u201cOpenness is not knowledge,\u201d he states very deliberately. \u201cMy own experience with alcoholism is not necessarily [like] anyone else\u2019s. But I have found the most therapeutic thing I can do is talk to other alcoholics who have been in a similar situation.\u201d</p> <p>In his book, he seems to suggest that the idea of what people consider problematic has broadened too much over the past few decades. \u201cHave we pathologised the human condition?\u201d he says, putting it far more elegantly. \u201cThere is a temptation to think, \u2018I should feel better.\u2019 Why? I don\u2019t feel OK all the time and I\u2019m OK with that. If I felt good all the time, that would be weird.\u201d</p> <p>Ultimately, he remains both hopeful and realistic about the impact his own sobriety can have on others: \u201cI know one thing \u2013 I know how you can stay sober if you\u2019re an alcoholic, and if you want to know I can help you. That\u2019s the only thing I know. It\u2019s taken me 25 years sober to get this. Everything else is entertainment. The house, the life, the car, the stuff, everything else is gravy and where I really should be is in the ground in 1992.

      "bodyText": "On the morning we meet, Glasgow seems especially delighted to have Craig Ferguson back in town. From the taxi driver who deposits him at the city centre cafe, to the waitress who reserves our table, to the punter who stops him for a selfie as he\u2019s walking across George Square, there a buzzy warmth and a no-arguments sense of ownership to how Ferguson is received on the street. The pally familiarity is not surprising: despite basing his career in the US for the past 25 years, Ferguson\u2019s broad frame and hairily handsome features are pretty recognisable. He did after all spend nine years presenting CBS\u2019s Late Late Show, which at its peak topped the ratings of both Jimmy Fallon and Conan O\u2019Brien. He stepped down in 2014 and James Corden took over, while Ferguson went on to win two Emmys with his new gameshow for the same network. And then there\u2019s a roll-call of standup specials and movie credits (he wrote and starred in the charming Saving Grace with Brenda Blethyn), not to mention one of American comedy\u2019s highest accolades: addressing the White House correspondents\u2019 dinner. \u201cThis is just another case of immigrants taking jobs Americans don\u2019t want,\u201d he told the dinner guests.

This limp comedy about the president\u2019s refusal to act on gun control is told from the perspective of his daughter. Despite a perfectly solid solo performance, there\u2019s little funny here.

Under Rachel Dart\u2019s precise direction, she is sharp as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ivanka-trump\">Ivanka</a>, fluent at the flicks between icy glares \u2013 seeming like she might strip the skin off your face if she thought it would improve her complexion \u2013 and succulent smiles. Immaculately dressed in a cape dress, she waits for \u201cdaddy\u201d to come out of a meeting in the Oval Office. Playing with a strand of hair, her words are doused in the arrogance imbued by being Trump\u2019s favourite. She is largely constrained but her patience wanes, and she occasionally unzips her skinsuit to let out some anger or lust. \u201cI even like that he\u2019d fuck me if he could,\u201d she says about her father in a huff.

      "bodyText": "Is Trump not yet beyond satire? This limp comedy about the president\u2019s refusal to act on gun control is told from the perspective of his daughter. Despite a perfectly solid solo performance, there\u2019s little funny here. The putrid new wave of shootings only serves to highlight the play\u2019s inability to carve any real wit around the issue. It is not McLean Peterson\u2019s fault. Under Rachel Dart\u2019s precise direction, she is sharp as Ivanka, fluent at the flicks between icy glares \u2013 seeming like she might strip the skin off your face if she thought it would improve her complexion \u2013 and succulent smiles. Immaculately dressed in a cape dress, she waits for \u201cdaddy\u201d to come out of a meeting in the Oval Office. Playing with a strand of hair, her words are doused in the arrogance imbued by being Trump\u2019s favourite. She is largely constrained but her patience wanes, and she occasionally unzips her skinsuit to let out some anger or lust. \u201cI even like that he\u2019d fuck me if he could,\u201d she says about her father in a huff.

Residents can buy their properties, with the option to pay in instalments.</p> <p>Still, some people, such as Norma Rodriguez, think it is a strategy intended to drive residents away. \u201cThe truth is that 95% of the people here won\u2019t be able to pay housing, and expenses, and utilities,\u201d she says. \u201cNo one here has a fixed income, everyone\u2019s living day to day, and social services keep getting cut. So what will happen? Those who can\u2019t pay will have to go.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/may/03/sign-up-for-the-cityscape-the-best-of-guardian-cities-every-week\">Sign up for the Cityscape: the best of Guardian Cities every week</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The move into the new housing project has been less than thrilling for Rodriguez and her family, and she says many residents are equally disappointed. Firstly, people accustomed to living in houses, no matter how small, now have to live in apartments. Also, like Rodriguez and her husband, who has an iron-smith business, the majority of people in the villa operate some kind of small business from their home or nearby. In the new home, she says there is barely any space for her husband to work. \u201cHe\u2019s basically working directly in the street.\u201d </p> <p>Then there were problems with the new houses themselves. Primarily constructed out of drywall, the houses had been hastily made and were not ready when the first families moved in, residents say. Additionally, there have been problems with the piping, and leaks.</p> <p>Fern\u00e1ndez argues that construction problems are to be expected and are usually fixed quickly. Responding to the concerns about people being able to afford their own homes, he says they want to \u201cstrengthen people\u2019s ability to generate more income, afford better housing, and have more stability\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"410aeeb71a26b6ad80b64b7dbabc325a22dac3c5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/410aeeb71a26b6ad80b64b7dbabc325a22dac3c5/0_505_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Villa 31 becomes Barrio 31\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barrio 31 is emerging: the new neighbourhood has housing blocks with solar panels on their roofs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Luisa Rollenhagen</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And so the project doggedly moves forward and in some parts of the villa, the work does look promising. Housing blocks painted in blue and green sport solar panels on their roofs; some streets are already being pulled open to install piping underneath; there are some clean and airy plazas, complete with minimalist playgrounds and cement planters.<br><br>Villa 31 has always been a site of resistance, nuisance, shame, opportunity, or resilience, depending on who you ask. After residents have spent decades surviving on their own, many fear being scammed, displaced, or steamrollered by a large bureaucratic machine.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/mar/25/they-dont-think-were-human-buenos-aires-violence-market-traders-protest-eviction\">'They don't think we're human': Buenos Aires market traders fight eviction</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But some say this does not invalidate the project.

Still, some people, such as Norma Rodriguez, think it is a strategy intended to drive residents away. \u201cThe truth is that 95% of the people here won\u2019t be able to pay housing, and expenses, and utilities,\u201d she says. \u201cNo one here has a fixed income, everyone\u2019s living day to day, and social services keep getting cut. So what will happen? Those who can\u2019t pay will have to go.\u201d The move into the new housing project has been less than thrilling for Rodriguez and her family, and she says many residents are equally disappointed. Firstly, people accustomed to living in houses, no matter how small, now have to live in apartments. Also, like Rodriguez and her husband, who has an iron-smith business, the majority of people in the villa operate some kind of small business from their home or nearby. In the new home, she says there is barely any space for her husband to work. \u201cHe\u2019s basically working directly in the street.\u201d Then there were problems with the new houses themselves. Primarily constructed out of drywall, the houses had been hastily made and were not ready when the first families moved in, residents say. Additionally, there have been problems with the piping, and leaks. Fern\u00e1ndez argues that construction problems are to be expected and are usually fixed quickly. Responding to the concerns about people being able to afford their own homes, he says they want to \u201cstrengthen people\u2019s ability to generate more income, afford better housing, and have more stability\u201d. And so the project doggedly moves forward and in some parts of the villa, the work does look promising. Housing blocks painted in blue and green sport solar panels on their roofs; some streets are already being pulled open to install piping underneath; there are some clean and airy plazas, complete with minimalist playgrounds and cement planters. Villa 31 has always been a site of resistance, nuisance, shame, opportunity, or resilience, depending on who you ask. After residents have spent decades surviving on their own, many fear being scammed, displaced, or steamrollered by a large bureaucratic machine. But some say this does not invalidate the project. Sanchez says: \u201cThey are investing a lot of money into this. And no one\u2019s going to complain if they bring electricity and running water and gas. And I think it\u2019s right to pay taxes for those things. But the problem is that they want to do things their way.\u201d Little things, like hiring outside contractors to water the lawn and the flowers in the plaza outside Rodriguez\u2019s house, instead of giving residents that responsibility, show that lack of trust is still a major hurdle. Fern\u00e1ndez acknowledges this, saying overcoming cultural prejudices may be the biggest challenge. \u201cWe need to not only integrate the people of the Barrio 31 into the city, we also need to bring in the people from the rest of the city,\u201d he says. \u201cFor me, our work will finally be done when a person tells their friend, \u2018hey, let\u2019s have dinner tonight at that lovely restaurant in the Barrio 31,\u2019 or \u2018hey, do you want to get a beer at that awesome bar in that neighbourhood?\u2019 Once that happens, and it\u2019s a normal thing, then we\u2019ve won.\u201d Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter",

      "body": "<p>Kathy Burke is distracted. It\u2019s the hottest day of the year, and she is desperate for a fag and a brew. \u201cI\u2019m gasping,\u201d she says, disappearing outside for a couple of minutes before we start our interview. \u201cIt\u2019s so hot, mate,\u201d she says, when she reappears. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t normally leave the house on a day like this.\u201d Then, just when I seem to have her full attention, her eyes dart upwards as she catches sight of a TV screen in the bar we are sitting in. \u201cSorry,\u201d she says, sounding stressed. \u201cI\u2019m just distracted by Boris Johnson.\u201d</p> <p>With another interviewee, this turn of events would feel stressful \u2013 as if you are never going to be able to get their attention. But with Burke, it\u2019s quite the opposite. As she tacks another affectionate \u201cbabe\u201d on to the end of a sentence or triumphantly declares: \u201cThat\u2019s such a good cup of tea,\u201d she is very much in the room with you. She is, of course, described by fans and critics as being \u201cnatural\u201d and \u201cdown to earth\u201d. Burke, people say, is a Real Person, citing incidents such as the <a href=\"https://www.thepoke.co.uk/2016/10/27/kathy-burke-wonderful-response-helena-bonham-carter-letters-page-time/#.WBPmOx0tEBY.twitter\" title=\"\">letter she sent to Time Out</a> magazine in the 90s, calling out Helena Bonham Carter for complaining about being posh and pretty. In the letter, she referred to herself as \u201ca lifelong member of the non-pretty working classes\u201d, and signed off with a four-letter word. More recently, there was her Twitter feed, where she referred to the \u201ctwats\u201d and \u201cdicks\u201d who run the world \u2013 most recently, those supporting gun rights in the US.</p> <p>The 55-year-old\u2019s work has ranged from brash comic characters, such as Gimme Gimme Gimme\u2019s Linda La Hughes (usually found snogging a poster of Liam Gallagher), to a domestic abuse victim opposite Ray Winstone in the film Nil By Mouth (for which she won best actress at Cannes in 1997) to a host of stage credits as a director. However, perhaps her best-known role is as Burke herself \u2013 the unluvviest luvvie of them all, who resides within a sought-after Islington postcode by default, having been born there to an Irish immigrant family. Does all this talk of her \u201cnormalness\u201d ever get boring? \u201cI like it, it\u2019s fine,\u201d she laughs. \u201cIt\u2019s much better than being described as aloof or in your own bubble.\u201d</p> <p>It is exactly Burke\u2019s relatable, national-treasure status that has led to her latest project: a three-part documentary about what it is to be a woman today, dealing with the themes of beauty and image; work and motherhood; and sex and relationships. The producers came to her, she says, \u201cbecause I\u2019m quite normal, I think\u201d. And, in the programme, whether she is interviewing the Love Island contestant Megan Barton-Hanson, an Anglican nun or members of the sweary Profanity Embroidery Group (\u201clike the punk version of the WI\u201d), you get the sense that she is someone people think they already know. Nobody, she says, \u201cseemed that shy around me\u201d. And, of course, she is very funny \u2013 offering her own withering perspectives as she finds out about her subjects\u2019 lives and challenges. Among them, a man who has had an affair and bought a Jag isn\u2019t going through a midlife crisis, \u201che\u2019s a fucking twat\u201d. And, on discovering the existence of the \u201cvajacial\u201d, a facial-style vagina treatment: \u201cSteam your fanny \u2013 fuck off!\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"86bbbc4a9c222bafc905666bc7a67d92ad0b2e8a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/86bbbc4a9c222bafc905666bc7a67d92ad0b2e8a/30_0_1125_675/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Burke and James Dreyfus in Gimme Gimme Gimme.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Burke and James Dreyfus in Gimme Gimme Gimme.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph:  BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One of her favourite subjects was the rapper Nadia Rose, whom she interviewed about the pressures of the music industry, in particular when it comes to looks (\u201cWhat a girl! She is great at what she does, and she expresses it \u2013 it\u2019s so refreshing\u201d), while Barton-Hanson, who discusses how she has had plastic surgery to further her \u201cinfluencer\u201d career, was a revelation. \u201cI liked what she had to say; she\u2019s in control of herself.\u201d</p> <p>Burke has often spoken about the challenges of growing up in an all-male household (her mother, Bridget, died of cancer when Burke was a baby). At the all-girl convent school she went to, <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/the-interview-kathy-burke-actress-and-director-talks-to-ben-thompson-1596006.html\" title=\"\">she has said she was known</a> as \u201cthe little fella in a skirt\u201d because she was so tomboyish. She has had to wrestle with the societal expectation \u2013 which she describes as \u201ca crock of shit\u201d \u2013 that at some point, she should have married and had kids. The reason she hasn\u2019t is simple: she didn\u2019t want to. She is single at the moment, but says she hasn\u2019t entirely sworn off another relationship. It\u2019s just that she is perfectly content without being in one.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a761a810d7f9b7133da3587d0f9b6cc950eeb3b4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a761a810d7f9b7133da3587d0f9b6cc950eeb3b4/0_0_4314_5292/815.jpg\" alt=\"A Rankin portrait of Burke, taken in 1994.\" width=\"815\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Rankin portrait of Burke, taken in 1994.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rankin</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After Burke\u2019s win at Cannes, she left London for a brief stint in Hollywood, appearing opposite Meryl Streep in the 1998 period drama Dancing at Lughnasa, about a group of unmarried sisters in 1930s Ireland. \u201cI sound like such an ungrateful wanker now,\u201d she laughs. \u201cBut the more successful I became as an actor, the less control I had. I became more of a puppet, really. It certainly felt like that, at least.\u201d There is a powerful scene in the first documentary, in which she goes to visit the photographer Rankin, who she asks \u2013 in the way that she does \u2013 for \u201ca little bit of turd-polishing\u201d. While she is in his studio, he shows her some photographs <a href=\"http://www.artnet.com/artists/rankin/kathy-burke-nhnXtWlk-XflGfLacA_m4A2\" title=\"\">he took of her at the turn of the millennium</a>, when her career was taking off. \u201cI remember that period in my life so strongly because I was in a really bad place,\u201d she says, recounting \u201ca breakdown\u201d she had in the late 90s, at around the time she was in Hollywood. \u201cIt really pissed me off. I was, like, why am I suddenly attractive now that I\u2019m skinny?\u201d</p> <p>Her appearance proved particularly pertinent during the making of the documentary; just before she was due to start filming, she was diagnosed with Bell\u2019s palsy, a condition that causes temporary facial paralysis. For Burke, it brought back painful memories of 2007, when she contracted the superbug <em>C difficile</em> in hospital when she was <a href=\"https://inews.co.uk/opinion/twitter-can-be-a-cesspit-but-its-made-me-laugh-through-ilnness/\" title=\"\">being treated for other health problems</a>. She almost died, and was out of work for a year, so falling ill again was another blow. \u201cIt was such a shock,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was, like, oh my God. What\u2019s happened? But the production company were brilliant \u2013 luckily the executive producer had had it as a kid, so she knew exactly what it entailed and how long it would take for me to get better.\u201d She had acupuncture, which helped a lot, and it is not noticeable on screen. \u201cBasically,\u201d she deadpans, \u201cit would\u2019ve been better if my face was moving, than if it wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>I wonder what it is like for someone who never knew their own mother to make a documentary about motherhood. Despite being raised around men \u2013 her father and two brothers \u2013 she has always had strong relationships with other women. It began with her mother\u2019s friend, Joan, and her godmother, Nellie, who helped to raise her, and who were fixtures in her childhood. \u201cI suppose the only downside of being looked after by these women was them making me go to mass,\u201d she laughs. She had a social worker when she was younger, who introduced her to Pat, a young woman who was writing a thesis on motherless girls. \u201cShe was fantastic,\u201d she says. \u201cShe took me to places like art galleries and the theatre, which weren\u2019t things we ever did as kids. The only bad bit was being able to ride in black taxis because it\u2019s the only way I\u2019ve wanted to travel since.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5d0c388c091cbf9c2b61cbc400766d9401e1f914\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5d0c388c091cbf9c2b61cbc400766d9401e1f914/250_0_3750_2250/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With Megan Barton-Hanson from Love Island.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Megan Barton-Hanson from Love Island.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Flicker Productions TV/Channel 4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Later, she would meet Anna Scher, a \u201cbig inspiration\u201d to Burke, whose renowned community theatre school has turned out many EastEnders actors and stars such as Get Out\u2019s Daniel Kaluuya. For her debut film role, in the 1982 prison drama Scrubbers, she worked with the Swedish actor and director Mai Zetterling, who was \u201clike a horse whisperer with me, really \u2026 she was constantly telling me: \u2018You need to write, you need to direct, you need to create your own work.\u2019 She wouldn\u2019t stand for any crap, even in the 80s, when the industry was totally run by men.\u201d Not long after, Burke began to collaborate with Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders, going on to appear as the straight-talking editor Magda alongside Saunders on Absolutely Fabulous. \u201cThey were like my big sisters of comedy,\u201d she says. \u201cThey were just brilliant and so encouraging. I was doing theatre at that point, and very much into it, but there was no money in it. I\u2019d get a call now and again from them, saying: \u2018We\u2019re going to put you in a sketch if you\u2019re free.\u2019 And I\u2019d be, like: \u2018Yep, yep, I\u2019m there!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>It is the \u201cgenerosity of spirit, understanding, all the nice, positive things\u201d that she experienced from the many female role models in her life that Burke says is the key to All Woman. She wanted to create a series of films celebrating rather than denigrating women \u2013 even if Burke doesn\u2019t always agree with the choices the subjects make. Take Laura, a young woman who, in the first episode, we see contemplating breast enlargement. \u201cI have always believed that women should be allowed to do what they want to do,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I do think people are making a hell of a lot of money out of other people\u2019s insecurities.\u201d</p> <p>Celebrating women doesn\u2019t have to mean \u201cbashing men\u201d, either, Burke says, expressing her happiness that \u201cmen are [now] allowed to have feelings\u201d. However, while there is mention of same-sex relationships, as some viewers may note, the documentary does avoid one contentious gender-related issue: the rights or lack thereof of transgender women. Was this a conscious decision? \u201cWe talked about maybe talking to trans women in this, but it\u2019s such a huge subject that I, personally, didn\u2019t want it to be just a passing moment,\u201d says Burke. \u201cI think that needs to be a whole separate programme.\u201d She pauses. \u201cWith trans people, I just think you can\u2019t help the way you are born, though. You know, it\u2019s DNA, it\u2019s genetics. I\u2019m just glad people can do things about their own happiness. I think this thought process that they\u2019re trying to wipe out women is a bit ridiculous \u2013 it\u2019s a minority of people.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3ab3c724836375b714168820ff5c85e829d4ca05\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3ab3c724836375b714168820ff5c85e829d4ca05/0_0_2896_1738/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In Scrubbers, her first film role, directed by Mai Zetterling.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In Scrubbers, her first film role, directed by Mai Zetterling.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handmade Films/Kobal/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Her eyes dart up to the headlines on the TV again. There\u2019s no Johnson, but instead news about the economy. \u201cThe whole thing is a terrible mess,\u201d she says. \u201cI really feel for young people, I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re going to do. Especially living in London, they can\u2019t afford a place to live and they won\u2019t be able to afford to eat soon. Look at Hoxton [in east London]. Hoxton was a shit-hole, and now it costs a fortune to live in someone\u2019s bin shed.\u201d If she were voting tomorrow, who would she back? \u201cI\u2019d probably go Green because I am really worried about climate change and the planet. I\u2019ve been a Labour voter all my life \u2026\u201d her voice trails off. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know how I feel about things at the moment, quite honestly.\u201d I wonder if, in light of her making a documentary series about women, she ever had any respect for Theresa May as a woman holding the country\u2019s highest office? \u201cI think that\u2019s crap,\u201d Burke says quickly. \u201cIf we want equality, we shouldn\u2019t then expect to be praised just because we\u2019re doing a certain job. That\u2019s not equality. Equality is acknowledging that she did a shit job.\u201d</p> <p>Burke\u2019s next directorial project is a \u201cukulele comedy\u201d, Honest Amy \u2013 which is at the Edinburgh fringe this month. It is a one-woman show starring Amy Booth-Steel, who also wrote it, and one of the main reasons Burke was keen to direct it was its crossover with the All Woman documentary. \u201cShe talks a lot about the same things, like body image,\u201d she explains. \u201cIt\u2019s a story about dealing with PTSD and depression after having cancer. I just empathised. I know where this young lady is coming from because after I got really sick, the toughest thing to deal with was what it did to my mental health.\u201d</p> <p>Her main takeaway from both experiences, she says, is that women need to stop criticising one another. \u201cI\u2019m not here to tell people what they should and shouldn\u2019t be doing,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m no Ann Widdecombe. One of the main themes about the documentary is, \u2018Let\u2019s just stop having a go at each other. Let\u2019s stop judging each other all the time.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>An hour later, with the sun still blazing, our interview is over. Burke swills her last dribble of tea, accosts the waitress so she can tell her \u201cit\u2019s a good cuppa here\u201d, and goes in search of her publicist \u2013 and maybe another cheeky smoke. (\u201cI think it\u2019s time for a fag, babe,\u201d she says.) But, before she goes, she wants to be fully clear about her intentions. \u201cI really love women,\u201d she says, with a smile. \u201cAnd I do think things are getting better, I think we\u2019re getting there.\u201d</p> <p><em>Kathy Burke\u2019s All Woman starts on Tuesday 13 August on Channel 4.</em></p>",

The 55-year-old\u2019s work has ranged from brash comic characters, such as Gimme Gimme Gimme\u2019s Linda La Hughes (usually found snogging a poster of Liam Gallagher), to a domestic abuse victim opposite Ray Winstone in the film Nil By Mouth (for which she won best actress at Cannes in 1997) to a host of stage credits as a director. However, perhaps her best-known role is as Burke herself \u2013 the unluvviest luvvie of them all, who resides within a sought-after Islington postcode by default, having been born there to an Irish immigrant family. Does all this talk of her \u201cnormalness\u201d ever get boring? \u201cI like it, it\u2019s fine,\u201d she laughs. \u201cIt\u2019s much better than being described as aloof or in your own bubble.\u201d It is exactly Burke\u2019s relatable, national-treasure status that has led to her latest project: a three-part documentary about what it is to be a woman today, dealing with the themes of beauty and image; work and motherhood; and sex and relationships. The producers came to her, she says, \u201cbecause I\u2019m quite normal, I think\u201d. And, in the programme, whether she is interviewing the Love Island contestant Megan Barton-Hanson, an Anglican nun or members of the sweary Profanity Embroidery Group (\u201clike the punk version of the WI\u201d), you get the sense that she is someone people think they already know. Nobody, she says, \u201cseemed that shy around me\u201d. And, of course, she is very funny \u2013 offering her own withering perspectives as she finds out about her subjects\u2019 lives and challenges. Among them, a man who has had an affair and bought a Jag isn\u2019t going through a midlife crisis, \u201che\u2019s a fucking twat\u201d. And, on discovering the existence of the \u201cvajacial\u201d, a facial-style vagina treatment: \u201cSteam your fanny \u2013 fuck off!\u201d One of her favourite subjects was the rapper Nadia Rose, whom she interviewed about the pressures of the music industry, in particular when it comes to looks (\u201cWhat a girl! She is great at what she does, and she expresses it \u2013 it\u2019s so refreshing\u201d), while Barton-Hanson, who discusses how she has had plastic surgery to further her \u201cinfluencer\u201d career, was a revelation. \u201cI liked what she had to say; she\u2019s in control of herself.\u201d Burke has often spoken about the challenges of growing up in an all-male household (her mother, Bridget, died of cancer when Burke was a baby). At the all-girl convent school she went to, she has said she was known as \u201cthe little fella in a skirt\u201d because she was so tomboyish. She has had to wrestle with the societal expectation \u2013 which she describes as \u201ca crock of shit\u201d \u2013 that at some point, she should have married and had kids. The reason she hasn\u2019t is simple: she didn\u2019t want to. She is single at the moment, but says she hasn\u2019t entirely sworn off another relationship. It\u2019s just that she is perfectly content without being in one. After Burke\u2019s win at Cannes, she left London for a brief stint in Hollywood, appearing opposite Meryl Streep in the 1998 period drama Dancing at Lughnasa, about a group of unmarried sisters in 1930s Ireland. \u201cI sound like such an ungrateful wanker now,\u201d she laughs. \u201cBut the more successful I became as an actor, the less control I had. I became more of a puppet, really. It certainly felt like that, at least.\u201d There is a powerful scene in the first documentary, in which she goes to visit the photographer Rankin, who she asks \u2013 in the way that she does \u2013 for \u201ca little bit of turd-polishing\u201d. While she is in his studio, he shows her some photographs he took of her at the turn of the millennium, when her career was taking off. \u201cI remember that period in my life so strongly because I was in a really bad place,\u201d she says, recounting \u201ca breakdown\u201d she had in the late 90s, at around the time she was in Hollywood. \u201cIt really pissed me off. I was, like, why am I suddenly attractive now that I\u2019m skinny?\u201d Her appearance proved particularly pertinent during the making of the documentary; just before she was due to start filming, she was diagnosed with Bell\u2019s palsy, a condition that causes temporary facial paralysis. For Burke, it brought back painful memories of 2007, when she contracted the superbug C difficile in hospital when she was being treated for other health problems. She almost died, and was out of work for a year, so falling ill again was another blow. \u201cIt was such a shock,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was, like, oh my God. What\u2019s happened? But the production company were brilliant \u2013 luckily the executive producer had had it as a kid, so she knew exactly what it entailed and how long it would take for me to get better.\u201d She had acupuncture, which helped a lot, and it is not noticeable on screen. \u201cBasically,\u201d she deadpans, \u201cit would\u2019ve been better if my face was moving, than if it wasn\u2019t.\u201d I wonder what it is like for someone who never knew their own mother to make a documentary about motherhood. Despite being raised around men \u2013 her father and two brothers \u2013 she has always had strong relationships with other women. It began with her mother\u2019s friend, Joan, and her godmother, Nellie, who helped to raise her, and who were fixtures in her childhood. \u201cI suppose the only downside of being looked after by these women was them making me go to mass,\u201d she laughs. She had a social worker when she was younger, who introduced her to Pat, a young woman who was writing a thesis on motherless girls. \u201cShe was fantastic,\u201d she says. \u201cShe took me to places like art galleries and the theatre, which weren\u2019t things we ever did as kids. The only bad bit was being able to ride in black taxis because it\u2019s the only way I\u2019ve wanted to travel since.\u201d Later, she would meet Anna Scher, a \u201cbig inspiration\u201d to Burke, whose renowned community theatre school has turned out many EastEnders actors and stars such as Get Out\u2019s Daniel Kaluuya. For her debut film role, in the 1982 prison drama Scrubbers, she worked with the Swedish actor and director Mai Zetterling, who was \u201clike a horse whisperer with me, really \u2026 she was constantly telling me: \u2018You need to write, you need to direct, you need to create your own work.\u2019 She wouldn\u2019t stand for any crap, even in the 80s, when the industry was totally run by men.\u201d Not long after, Burke began to collaborate with Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders, going on to appear as the straight-talking editor Magda alongside Saunders on Absolutely Fabulous. \u201cThey were like my big sisters of comedy,\u201d she says. \u201cThey were just brilliant and so encouraging. I was doing theatre at that point, and very much into it, but there was no money in it. I\u2019d get a call now and again from them, saying: \u2018We\u2019re going to put you in a sketch if you\u2019re free.\u2019 And I\u2019d be, like: \u2018Yep, yep, I\u2019m there!\u2019\u201d It is the \u201cgenerosity of spirit, understanding, all the nice, positive things\u201d that she experienced from the many female role models in her life that Burke says is the key to All Woman. She wanted to create a series of films celebrating rather than denigrating women \u2013 even if Burke doesn\u2019t always agree with the choices the subjects make. Take Laura, a young woman who, in the first episode, we see contemplating breast enlargement. \u201cI have always believed that women should be allowed to do what they want to do,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I do think people are making a hell of a lot of money out of other people\u2019s insecurities.\u201d Celebrating women doesn\u2019t have to mean \u201cbashing men\u201d, either, Burke says, expressing her happiness that \u201cmen are [now] allowed to have feelings\u201d. However, while there is mention of same-sex relationships, as some viewers may note, the documentary does avoid one contentious gender-related issue: the rights or lack thereof of transgender women. Was this a conscious decision? \u201cWe talked about maybe talking to trans women in this, but it\u2019s such a huge subject that I, personally, didn\u2019t want it to be just a passing moment,\u201d says Burke. \u201cI think that needs to be a whole separate programme.\u201d She pauses. \u201cWith trans people, I just think you can\u2019t help the way you are born, though. You know, it\u2019s DNA, it\u2019s genetics. I\u2019m just glad people can do things about their own happiness. I think this thought process that they\u2019re trying to wipe out women is a bit ridiculous \u2013 it\u2019s a minority of people.\u201d Her eyes dart up to the headlines on the TV again. There\u2019s no Johnson, but instead news about the economy. \u201cThe whole thing is a terrible mess,\u201d she says. \u201cI really feel for young people, I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re going to do. Especially living in London, they can\u2019t afford a place to live and they won\u2019t be able to afford to eat soon. Look at Hoxton [in east London]. Hoxton was a shit-hole, and now it costs a fortune to live in someone\u2019s bin shed.\u201d If she were voting tomorrow, who would she back? \u201cI\u2019d probably go Green because I am really worried about climate change and the planet. I\u2019ve been a Labour voter all my life \u2026\u201d her voice trails off. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know how I feel about things at the moment, quite honestly.\u201d I wonder if, in light of her making a documentary series about women, she ever had any respect for Theresa May as a woman holding the country\u2019s highest office? \u201cI think that\u2019s crap,\u201d Burke says quickly. \u201cIf we want equality, we shouldn\u2019t then expect to be praised just because we\u2019re doing a certain job. That\u2019s not equality. Equality is acknowledging that she did a shit job.\u201d Burke\u2019s next directorial project is a \u201cukulele comedy\u201d, Honest Amy \u2013 which is at the Edinburgh fringe this month. It is a one-woman show starring Amy Booth-Steel, who also wrote it, and one of the main reasons Burke was keen to direct it was its crossover with the All Woman documentary. \u201cShe talks a lot about the same things, like body image,\u201d she explains. \u201cIt\u2019s a story about dealing with PTSD and depression after having cancer. I just empathised. I know where this young lady is coming from because after I got really sick, the toughest thing to deal with was what it did to my mental health.\u201d Her main takeaway from both experiences, she says, is that women need to stop criticising one another. \u201cI\u2019m not here to tell people what they should and shouldn\u2019t be doing,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m no Ann Widdecombe. One of the main themes about the documentary is, \u2018Let\u2019s just stop having a go at each other. Let\u2019s stop judging each other all the time.\u2019\u201d An hour later, with the sun still blazing, our interview is over. Burke swills her last dribble of tea, accosts the waitress so she can tell her \u201cit\u2019s a good cuppa here\u201d, and goes in search of her publicist \u2013 and maybe another cheeky smoke. (\u201cI think it\u2019s time for a fag, babe,\u201d she says.) But, before she goes, she wants to be fully clear about her intentions. \u201cI really love women,\u201d she says, with a smile. \u201cAnd I do think things are getting better, I think we\u2019re getting there.\u201d Kathy Burke\u2019s All Woman starts on Tuesday 13 August on Channel 4.",

Even if no new gas or coal power plants, roads and airports are built, the carbon emissions from current installations are likely to push us past this threshold. Only by retiring some of this infrastructure before the end of its natural life could we secure a 50% chance of remaining within the temperature limit agreed in Paris in 2015. Yet, far from decommissioning this Earth-killing machine, almost everywhere governments and industry stoke its fires.</p> <p>The oil and gas industry intends to spend $4.9tn <a href=\"https://www.globalwitness.org/en/blog/big-oil-set-to-spend-5-trillion/\" title=\"\">over the next 10 years</a>, exploring and developing new reserves, none of which we can afford to burn.

While renewable and nuclear power supplies have also risen in this period, the gap between the production of fossil fuels and low-carbon energy has not been narrowing, but steadily widening. What counts, in seeking to prevent runaway global heating, is not the good things we start to do, but the bad things we cease to do. Shutting down fossil infrastructure requires government intervention.</p> <p>But in many nations, governments intervene not to protect humanity from the existential threat of fossil fuels, but to protect the fossil fuel industry from the existential threat of public protest.

In June, Donald Trump\u2019s administration proposed federal legislation that would <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2019/06/05/pipeline-protests-proposed-legislation-phmsa-alec/\" title=\"\">jail people for up to 20 years </a>for disrupting pipeline construction.</p> <p>Global Witness reports that, in several nations, <a href=\"https://www.globalwitness.org/documents/19766/Enemies_of_the_State.pdf\" title=\"\">led by the Philippines</a>, governments have incited the murder of environmental protesters. The process <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2019/07/30/criminalization-environmental-activists-global-witness-report/\" title=\"\">begins with rhetoric</a>, demonising civil protest as extremism and terrorism, then shifts to legislation, criminalising attempts to protect the living planet.

Daily ice losses on this scale are 50 years ahead of schedule: they were forecast in the climate models for 2070. A paper in Geophysical Research Letters reveals that the thawing of permafrost in the Canadian High Arctic now exceeds the depths of melting projected by scientists for 2090. While record temperatures in Europe last month caused discomfort and disruption, in south-west Asia they are starting to reach the point at which the human body hits its thermal limits. Ever wider tracts of the world will come to rely on air conditioning, not only for basic comfort but also for human survival: another feedback spiral, as air conditioning requires massive energy use. Those who cannot afford it will either move or die. Already, climate breakdown is driving more people from their homes than either poverty or conflict, while contributing to both these other factors. A recent paper in Nature shows that we have little hope of preventing more than 1.5C of global heating unless we retire existing fossil fuel infrastructure. Even if no new gas or coal power plants, roads and airports are built, the carbon emissions from current installations are likely to push us past this threshold. Only by retiring some of this infrastructure before the end of its natural life could we secure a 50% chance of remaining within the temperature limit agreed in Paris in 2015. Yet, far from decommissioning this Earth-killing machine, almost everywhere governments and industry stoke its fires. The oil and gas industry intends to spend $4.9tn over the next 10 years, exploring and developing new reserves, none of which we can afford to burn. According to the IMF, every year governments subsidise fossil fuels to the tune of $5tn \u2013 many times more than they spend on addressing our existential predicament. The US spends 10 times more on these mad subsidies than on its federal education budget. Last year, the world burned more fossil fuels than ever before. An analysis by Barry Saxifrage in Canada\u2019s National Observer shows that half the fossil fuels ever used by humans have been burned since 1990. While renewable and nuclear power supplies have also risen in this period, the gap between the production of fossil fuels and low-carbon energy has not been narrowing, but steadily widening. What counts, in seeking to prevent runaway global heating, is not the good things we start to do, but the bad things we cease to do. Shutting down fossil infrastructure requires government intervention. But in many nations, governments intervene not to protect humanity from the existential threat of fossil fuels, but to protect the fossil fuel industry from the existential threat of public protest. In the US, legislators in 18 states have put forward bills criminalising protests against pipelines, seeking to crush democratic dissent on behalf of the oil industry. In June, Donald Trump\u2019s administration proposed federal legislation that would jail people for up to 20 years for disrupting pipeline construction. Global Witness reports that, in several nations, led by the Philippines, governments have incited the murder of environmental protesters. The process begins with rhetoric, demonising civil protest as extremism and terrorism, then shifts to legislation, criminalising attempts to protect the living planet. Criminalisation then helps legitimise physical assaults and murder. A similar demonisation has begun in Britain, with the publication by a dark money-funded lobby group, Policy Exchange, of a report smearing Extinction Rebellion. Like all such publications, it was given a series of major platforms by the BBC, which preserved its customary absence of curiosity about who funded it. Secretly funded lobby groups \u2013 such as the TaxPayers\u2019 Alliance, the Adam Smith Institute and the Institute of Economic Affairs \u2013 have supplied some of the key advisers to Boris Johnson\u2019s government. He has also appointed Andrea Leadsom, an enthusiastic fracking advocate, to run the department responsible for climate policy, and Grant Shapps \u2013 who until last month chaired the British Infrastructure Group, which promotes the expansion of roads and airports \u2013 as transport secretary. Last week the Guardian revealed documents suggesting that the firm run by Johnson\u2019s ally and adviser Lynton Crosby has produced unbranded Facebook ads on behalf of the coal industry. What we see here looks like the denouement of the Pollution Paradox. Because the dirtiest industries attract the least public support, they have the greatest incentive to spend money on politics, to get the results they want and we don\u2019t. They fund political parties, lobby groups and thinktanks, fake grassroots organisations and dark ads on social media. As a result, politics comes to be dominated by the dirtiest industries. We are told to fear the \u201cextremists\u201d who protest against ecocide and challenge dirty industry and the dirty governments it buys. But the extremists we should fear are those who hold office. \u2022 George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist",

Putin is assessed by UK intelligence agencies as having been \u201clikely\u201d to have approved of the attack in March 2018 on Sergei Skripal, a former Russian military officer, and his daughter, both of whom were left seriously ill but survived. Dawn Sturgess later died after coming across a discarded perfume bottle used by two Russian intelligence agents to carry the military grade nerve agent. Two Russian agents have been charged over the attack, and Britain wants them extradited and has issued a European arrest warrant (EAW) and Interpol red notice for their detention.

      "body": "<p>I\u2019ve been asking strangers random questions for 20 years in the name of journalism, but I\u2019d never been vox-popped myself until last Friday, when I was approached on Oxford Street by someone from a Japanese television station. What did I think of Meghan Markle?</p> <p>I said I thought she was great. Furthermore (warming to my theme), I thought the reaction against her in the British media was symptomatic of a deeply disturbing moment of racist hegemony that has crashed over us like sewage, following the dam burst of Brexit.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Her list of heroines was glitzy but political, and most of the rage centred on the fact that she hadn\u2019t chosen the Queen</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Yes, I admit there was quite a cock-eyed, irrigation-system riff going on in that metaphor, and I must have been talking for about 15 minutes, but they wanted more. What did I think of the cover stars Markle chose for her guest editorship of Vogue? The list had already had some hostile attention in the press, which is why they were asking. The princess\u2019s heroines included Greta Thunberg, Jane Fonda, novelist Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie and actor Jameela Jamil. It was glitzy but it was political, and most of the confected rage seemed to centre on the fact that she hadn\u2019t chosen the Queen. I thought Meghan\u2019s list was great; I think she\u2019s great. Unnervingly, I think the royals are great.</p> <p>If you dwell too hard on how things used to be, it becomes surreal: the royal family have typically been seen, by the forces of progress, as part of the apparatus of the status quo. With their unearned wealth, and protected by inscrutable silence, they shored up and symbolised the entitled establishment more trenchantly than anyone could by making a speech.

      "bodyText": "I\u2019ve been asking strangers random questions for 20 years in the name of journalism, but I\u2019d never been vox-popped myself until last Friday, when I was approached on Oxford Street by someone from a Japanese television station. What did I think of Meghan Markle? I said I thought she was great. Furthermore (warming to my theme), I thought the reaction against her in the British media was symptomatic of a deeply disturbing moment of racist hegemony that has crashed over us like sewage, following the dam burst of Brexit. Yes, I admit there was quite a cock-eyed, irrigation-system riff going on in that metaphor, and I must have been talking for about 15 minutes, but they wanted more. What did I think of the cover stars Markle chose for her guest editorship of Vogue? The list had already had some hostile attention in the press, which is why they were asking. The princess\u2019s heroines included Greta Thunberg, Jane Fonda, novelist Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie and actor Jameela Jamil. It was glitzy but it was political, and most of the confected rage seemed to centre on the fact that she hadn\u2019t chosen the Queen. I thought Meghan\u2019s list was great; I think she\u2019s great. Unnervingly, I think the royals are great. If you dwell too hard on how things used to be, it becomes surreal: the royal family have typically been seen, by the forces of progress, as part of the apparatus of the status quo. With their unearned wealth, and protected by inscrutable silence, they shored up and symbolised the entitled establishment more trenchantly than anyone could by making a speech. It\u2019s true that the staunch republicanism of your average leftie in the 1970s and 80s faded in the callow 90s, when it simply wasn\u2019t cool to worry about privilege. But even as many anti-monarchists turned to other issues, none could have ever imagined standing on the same side of the barricades as the royals. Yet here we are. \u201cThe Queen won\u2019t accept that,\u201d people say sagely to one another, as another hard-right ideologue floats the possibility of proroguing parliament to crash Britain out of the European Union. The thrust of the attacks on Markle\u2019s Vogue editorship \u2013 condemning it as virtue-signalling of the worst kind, as Hollywood self-aggrandisement shoving its hypocritical values down our throats \u2013 was a variation on the theme: \u201cGet back in your box, princess.\u201d It is typical of the age that anyone allying themselves with an optimistic vision \u2013 what if we could avert climate catastrophe? What if we stamped out prejudice? \u2013 is immediately greeted with this kind of ire. The mean-spirited arguments are constructed on a foundation of bad faith. Only the underprivileged can talk about privilege; only the excluded can talk about bigotry; only the monk can talk about consumption.

Booker\u2019s plan would require all gun owners to obtain a license through the federal government, impose new restrictions on bulk gun purchases, limit purchases to one handgun a month and subject gun manufacturers to meet more stringent federal safety standards.</p> <p>Senator <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/kamala-harris\">Kamala Harris</a> vowed a series of executive actions in April, which included mandatory background checks on customers of any dealer who sells more than five guns a year and tighter regulation of gun manufacturers and licensing. She also put forward a plan that would ban the importation of AR-15-style assault weapons to the US and seek to close a loophole that paves the way for some domestic abusers to purchase firearms.</p> <p>Nearly all of the Democratic presidential contenders have said they support an assault weapons ban and universal background checks. Several have embraced a voluntary gun buyback program, under which individuals could turn in their firearms to federal agencies in exchange for some form of compensation.</p> <p>In the wake of the twin shootings over the weekend, the former vice-president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden\">Joe Biden</a>, the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders and the former Texas congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke all came out in favor of national buyback programs for assault weapons.</p> <p>And the South Bend mayor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/pete-buttigieg\">Pete But</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/pete-buttigieg\">tigieg</a>, rolled out a <a href=\"https://medium.com/@teampete/an-action-plan-to-combat-the-national-threat-posed-by-hate-and-the-gun-lobby-5752a68c954e\">plan</a> on Tuesday that would establish a national gun licensing system and is the first to dedicate a section to the threat of white nationalism, promising a $1bn investment toward combating and preventing extremism and radicalization.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember a time when, this early on in the electoral process, you saw the presidential candidates prioritize gun reform,\u201d said Igor Volsky, the executive director of Guns Down America and author of the book Guns Down: How to Defeat the NRA and Build a Safer Future with Fewer Guns.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re doing that now and they\u2019re doing it in the boldest language they\u2019ve used in about 20 to 25 years.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/topics/gun-policy/\">Polling</a> has consistently shown that a majority of Americans support some form of new gun laws, such as expanding background checks and banning <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/28/gun-control-polling-parkland-430099\">high-capacity magazines</a>. The US Congress has nonetheless been marred by inaction amid opposition to new gun laws from Republicans in Congress.</p> <p>The last time lawmakers in Washington debated the issue in earnest was in the aftermath of the 2012 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/13/newtown-sandy-hook-shooting-victims-five-years-later?CMP=twt_gu\">Sandy Hook elementary school massacre</a> in Newtown, Connecticut, which claimed the lives of 20 children, aged six and seven, and six educators.</p> <p>Despite an aggressive push for stricter gun laws by the Obama administration, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/apr/18/obama-condemns-senate-gun-reform\">Republican-led filibuster</a> blocked the advancement legislation that would have expanded universal background checks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"544a81af11491139e8442269528d8c1805d65fed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/544a81af11491139e8442269528d8c1805d65fed/0_111_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Activists at a demonstration honoring the victims of the El Paso and Dayton mass shootings, in Miami, Florida, 6 August 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Activists at a demonstration honoring the victims of the El Paso and Dayton mass shootings, in Miami, Florida, on Tuesday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Crist\u00f3bal Herrera/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Obama spent much of his second term decrying congressional inaction, plainly stating that the US was \u201cthe only developed country on earth\u201d where school shootings were routine. The former president signed 23 executive actions aimed at reducing gun violence \u2013 some of which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> reversed upon taking office.</p> <p>In a sign of the shifting political climate, Clinton also took aim squarely at the NRA during the 2016 campaign and identified gun violence as a top priority. During the Democratic primaries, she repeatedly criticized Sanders\u2019 record on guns and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/05/hillary-clinton-unveils-plan-for-tougher-checks-in-bid-to-reduce-gun-violence\">championed measures</a> that included rolling back legal immunity for the gun industry.</p> <p>From the anti-gun violence movement\u2019s vantage point, the often testy sparring between Clinton and Sanders over guns foreshadowed how the issue was steadily gaining prominence with each election cycle.</p> <p>\u201cEight years ago, we could barely get liberal Democrats interested in gun safety after Gabby Giffords \u2013 one of their own colleagues \u2013 was almost assassinated,\u201d said Mark Glaze, a longtime gun control advocate, in reference to the 2011 mass shooting in Tucson, Arizona.</p> <p>\u201cToday gun violence prevention is a litmus test for Democrats up and down the ballot and it\u2019s important for Republicans in swing districts.

Booker\u2019s plan would require all gun owners to obtain a license through the federal government, impose new restrictions on bulk gun purchases, limit purchases to one handgun a month and subject gun manufacturers to meet more stringent federal safety standards. Senator Kamala Harris vowed a series of executive actions in April, which included mandatory background checks on customers of any dealer who sells more than five guns a year and tighter regulation of gun manufacturers and licensing. She also put forward a plan that would ban the importation of AR-15-style assault weapons to the US and seek to close a loophole that paves the way for some domestic abusers to purchase firearms. Nearly all of the Democratic presidential contenders have said they support an assault weapons ban and universal background checks. Several have embraced a voluntary gun buyback program, under which individuals could turn in their firearms to federal agencies in exchange for some form of compensation. In the wake of the twin shootings over the weekend, the former vice-president Joe Biden, the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders and the former Texas congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke all came out in favor of national buyback programs for assault weapons. And the South Bend mayor, Pete Buttigieg, rolled out a plan on Tuesday that would establish a national gun licensing system and is the first to dedicate a section to the threat of white nationalism, promising a $1bn investment toward combating and preventing extremism and radicalization. \u201cI don\u2019t remember a time when, this early on in the electoral process, you saw the presidential candidates prioritize gun reform,\u201d said Igor Volsky, the executive director of Guns Down America and author of the book Guns Down: How to Defeat the NRA and Build a Safer Future with Fewer Guns. \u201cThey\u2019re doing that now and they\u2019re doing it in the boldest language they\u2019ve used in about 20 to 25 years.\u201d Polling has consistently shown that a majority of Americans support some form of new gun laws, such as expanding background checks and banning high-capacity magazines. The US Congress has nonetheless been marred by inaction amid opposition to new gun laws from Republicans in Congress. The last time lawmakers in Washington debated the issue in earnest was in the aftermath of the 2012 Sandy Hook elementary school massacre in Newtown, Connecticut, which claimed the lives of 20 children, aged six and seven, and six educators. Despite an aggressive push for stricter gun laws by the Obama administration, a Republican-led filibuster blocked the advancement legislation that would have expanded universal background checks. Obama spent much of his second term decrying congressional inaction, plainly stating that the US was \u201cthe only developed country on earth\u201d where school shootings were routine. The former president signed 23 executive actions aimed at reducing gun violence \u2013 some of which Donald Trump reversed upon taking office. In a sign of the shifting political climate, Clinton also took aim squarely at the NRA during the 2016 campaign and identified gun violence as a top priority. During the Democratic primaries, she repeatedly criticized Sanders\u2019 record on guns and championed measures that included rolling back legal immunity for the gun industry. From the anti-gun violence movement\u2019s vantage point, the often testy sparring between Clinton and Sanders over guns foreshadowed how the issue was steadily gaining prominence with each election cycle. \u201cEight years ago, we could barely get liberal Democrats interested in gun safety after Gabby Giffords \u2013 one of their own colleagues \u2013 was almost assassinated,\u201d said Mark Glaze, a longtime gun control advocate, in reference to the 2011 mass shooting in Tucson, Arizona. \u201cToday gun violence prevention is a litmus test for Democrats up and down the ballot and it\u2019s important for Republicans in swing districts. That\u2019s a big change in a very short time.\u201d",

Experts say that both the Obama and Trump administrations have not diverted enough federal resources to pursue terrorism tied to white extremism, pushing most counter-terror efforts to fighting groups associated with extremist Islam in the wake of the September 11 terrorist attacks.

      "bodyText": "Two parking inspectors will launch a major test of New South Wales whistleblower protections after they were sacked for revealing alleged attempts to stop them issuing fines at a councillor\u2019s private property developments. The rangers claim that in 2014 they were given repeated directions to give \u201cpreferential treatment\u201d to elected members of the now defunct Auburn council in western Sydney \u2013 best known for its controversial former deputy mayor, Salim Mehajer, who rose to prominence when he closed a public street for his wedding, causing traffic chaos. The rangers allege they were directed to stop issuing fines to construction workers at property developments owned by Auburn councillor Ronney Oueik, and to give preferential treatment to a nearby college, the Al-Faisal College, also at the direction of Oueik. Oueik has repeatedly denied the allegations and was previously cleared of wrongdoing. The rangers first made the claims to an independent Auburn councillor, Irene Simms, who also helped them approach the NSW independent commission against corruption (Icac). A number of rangers later gave evidence of the alleged preferential treatment to a 2016 public inquiry examining a series of scandals that led the state government to suspend Auburn council. In August 2016, not long after the inquiry finished, the two rangers were suspended for speaking to Simms, an action said to have breached the council\u2019s code of conduct. Their employment was terminated four months later. The sackings threw their lives into financial and psychological turmoil, court documents allege. The pair have been unable to secure work since, and have suffered significant financial and mental stress. This week, they launched a rare case under NSW\u2019s Public Interest Disclosure Act \u2013 the state\u2019s whistleblower protection regime. Court documents filed with the NSW district court say they were owed protection after blowing the whistle, and alleged their treatment caused psychological injury, liability for medical and related expenses, and economic loss. The case is yet another example of claims of mistreatment of public interest whistleblowers. Federally, the government is pursuing former intelligence officer Witness K and Bernard Collaery, who revealed an illegal spy operation targeting Timor-Leste, Richard Boyle, a tax office worker who blew the whistle on the aggressive pursuit of tax debts, and David McBride, a defence lawyer who leaked secret documents to the ABC. The Auburn case also highlights the often difficult situations faced by Australian whistleblowers, who are left with protracted and expensive legal proceedings as their only real recourse to acts of reprisal. Simms, the former Auburn councillor, said the two parking inspectors were acting in the interests of the community and should have been praised, not sacked, for their actions. \u201cThey should have been rewarded for what they did on behalf of the community,\u201d Simms told Guardian Australia. \u201cInstead they were punished, and I find that reprehensible.\u201d The case has been lodged against the Cumberland council, which absorbed the Auburn council in 2016 as part of NSW\u2019s local government amalgamations. The rangers are being represented by Carroll &amp; O\u2019Dea Lawyers. Partner Scott Dougall did not comment in detail about the case, but said: \u201cWhen whistleblowers do come forward we need to recognise they are in a vulnerable position. Civil remedies can be available when they are treated unfairly after making a disclosure.\u201d Oueik also gave evidence to the 2016 inquiry, denying any suggestion he attempted to influence the operations of the rangers, and accusing them of having a \u201chidden agenda with Irene Simms to bring me down\u201d. Oueik was not found to have breached any laws, or deliberately sought preferential treatment at his developments or the college. But the inquiry did find Oueik \u201cshould not have involved himself directly with the Council Rangers in respect of any parking issues concerning the private interests he had in his development site\u201d. Cumberland council said it was yet to be served with the claim and declined to comment. Guardian Australia approached Oueik for a further response.",

FamilyMart, which has 14,000 stores nationwide, said it had closed the store in the busy Tokyo district of Shibuya after users posted clips of at least half a dozen rats inside the shop. One video showed the creatures running along the top of a drinks refrigerator, before one falls onto the floor next to an ATM machine and scampers off. In another clip, which appears to be from the same store, two rats can be seen crawling behind items on the baked goods shelf. Public broadcaster NHK said one of the videos had been viewed more than 5 million times since it was posted on Twitter and YouTube on Tuesday. \u201cWe deeply apologise for making (customers) feel uncomfortable and uneasy,\u201d FamilyMart said in a statement on its website. The firm said it took the incident seriously, adding that the store would remain closed while it worked with local health authorities to destroy stock and investigate the cause of the apparent infestation. \u201cWe will consider the possibility of resuming operations in consideration of the surrounding environment of the store,\u201d the statement added. Despite their reputation for cleanliness, Japan\u2019s food providers have been embarrassed by several online revelations of poor hygiene this year. In February, FamilyMart sacked an employee after a video emerged showing him licking items of food. The same month, Seven Eleven Japan dismissed two employees after one of them spat what appeared to be a mouthful of food into an oden hotpot container while his colleagues filmed him. The same month, a chef at the sushi chain Kura Sushi was filmed throwing a portion of fish into a bin, before retrieving it and placing it back on a worktop. In March, the restaurant chain Ootoya closed most of its 350 stores for an emergency staff training day after a masked employee was filmed exposing himself in one of its outlets in Osaka.",

      "bodyText": "A contentious mural on Sydney\u2019s Bondi Beach highlighting Australia\u2019s hardline immigration policies and deaths in detention has been vandalised, amid calls for its removal. The black and white artwork, \u201cNot \u2026 Welcome to Bondi\u201d, depicted a row of heavily armed and masked Australian Border Force officers. Artist Luke Cornish, who has a show on display at the Bondi Pavilion, said the piece was a commentary on Australia\u2019s treatment of asylum seekers. \u201cThe 24 Australian Border Force officers represent the 24 suicides in these detention facilities (onshore and offshore) since 2010,\u201d he wrote on Instagram recently. The temporary mural on the seawall at the popular beach has drawn both public praise and censure, with a local Liberal councillor calling it \u201coffensive\u201d. On Tuesday night the council debated a motion to have it immediately removed. That motion was defeated, with council noting it was only going to be in place for the duration of Cornish\u2019s show anyway. On Wednesday, however, residents discovered the mural had been largely painted over. New South Wales police confirmed they received a report of malicious damage and are investigating the matter, while the council is reviewing footage from nearby CCTV cameras. The Waverley Council mayor, John Wakefield, condemned the defacing of the artwork. \u201cThe decision of council gained cross-party support for a reasoned and considered approach which took into account \u2013 and paid respect to \u2013 the artist, as well as the views of those calling for the temporary mural to be removed, and those who wanted it to remain,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cRegrettably, someone has now taken the law into their own hands.\u201d Local Liberal councillor Leon Goltsman had previously condemned the artwork on his Facebook page, saying it was a \u201cfailure under the Labor/Greens-controlled council\u201d. \u201cWhat we now have are politically motivated offensive propaganda likely to offend families and turn away visitors,\u201d he wrote on 28 July.

      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s energy regulator has launched court action against four windfarm operators, alleging they failed to meet performance requirements during 2016\u2019s statewide South Australian blackout. About 850,000 homes lost power on 28 September that year, when severe weather conditions led to significant damage to SA transmission lines, causing voltage disturbances. The event heightened a fractious national debate about energy policy. The Australian Energy Regulator has said a loss of wind generation after the voltage disturbances contributed to the the blackout. It alleges subsidiaries of the four companies \u2013 AGL Energy, Neoen SA, Pacific Hydro and Tilt Renewables \u2013 failed to ensure their windfarms complied with a generator performance standard requirement and had automatic protection systems to ensure continuity of supply. The regulator\u2019s chair, Paula Conboy, said the alleged failures meant the Australian Energy Market Operator was not fully informed when responding to the system-wide failure. \u201cThe [regulator] has brought these proceedings to send a strong signal to all energy businesses about the importance of compliance with performance standards to promote system security and reliability,\u201d she said. In an investigation published in December, the regulator said it did not intend to take formal enforcement action over the incident as it believed it would be more effective to focus on \u201cremedial recommendations for improved processes\u201d. It noted the unprecedented circumstances of the blackout. A fact sheet released by the regulator at the time said the investigation found some instances in which companies did not comply with obligations but they \u201cdid not contribute to the state going black\u201d and all key obligations had been met. In a note attached to its statement on Wednesday, the regulator said that report applied to events leading up to the blackout and the subsequent system restoration and market suspension only. It said the charges related to the blackout itself, which was not the focus of that investigation. AGL said it did not accept the the regulator\u2019s conclusions, that it had complied with national electricity rules and would \u201cstrongly contest\u201d the charges.

Tilt Renewables said it believed it had acted in good faith and in accordance with the national electricity rules. Pacific Hydro declined to comment. A market operator report in 2017 found the blackout had been caused by extreme weather, including two tornadoes with wind speeds of between 190km/h and 260km/h. It said windfarms rode out the grid disturbances prompted by the loss of a transmission line, but a protection mechanism in the turbines had triggered a sustained reduction in power in the state.

Abortion has been a criminal offence in New South Wales since 1900, and unlawfully procuring an abortion is punishable by up to 10 years' imprisonment. Doctors are able to conduct abortions if they believe the pregnancy is a risk to a woman\u2019s physical or mental health, and a common law precedent set in 1971 means social and economic factors may also be taken into consideration. Laws before the NSW parliament would make abortion legal on request up to 22 weeks, and with the approval of two doctors beyond that.</p>\n    <p><b>Queensland</b><br>The NSW legislation is based off the bill that passed in Queensland last year. Abortion is legal until 22 weeks gestation, and thereafter with the approval of two doctors.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Victoria</b><br>Legal to 24 weeks and then after 24 weeks with two doctors\u2019 approval.</p>\n    <p><b>ACT</b><br>Legal. Until last year, only a registered medical practitioner could carry out the procedure in an approved facility. However a change to ACT law last year now allows general practitioners to prescribe abortion drugs such as MS\u20112 Step.</p>\n    <p><b>South Australia</b><br>Legal up to 28 weeks but only if two doctors agree that a woman\u2019s physical and/or mental health is endangered by pregnancy, or for serious foetal abnormality.

      "bodyText": "Peak health and women\u2019s groups have slammed proposed amendments to an historic bill to decriminalise abortion in New South Wales, saying the changes are a \u201cperversion\u201d of the legislation that would result in \u201can additional burden on medical practitioners and to delay access to care\u201d. On Wednesday the Australian Medical Association said it was concerned the objectives of the bill risked being \u201cderailed by unfounded fear-mongering on abortion\u201d while the NSW Pro-Choice alliance said the amendments \u201cpresent a worse situation than the status quo\u201d. On Tuesday a number of 11th-hour amendments were floated by MPs including senior Liberal Party minister Mark Speakman and Rob Stokes. The amendments put forward by Speakman and Stokes would place new restrictions on terminations after 22 weeks so that a pregnant woman would need the approval of a four-person hospital advisory committee, rather than a second medical practitioner as proposed under the original bill. The procedure would have to be performed by a \u201cspecialist\u201d medical practitioner in a public hospital, or private hospital designated by the health minister. As well, doctors who have a conscientious objection to performing abortions would not have to refer a pregnant woman seeking a termination to another medical practitioner before 22 weeks. And doctors would be required to receive \u201cinformed consent\u201d before performing abortions. Describing the amendments as \u201cunnecessary and insulting\u201d the AMA said the \u201cclear intention\u201d was to \u201cimpose an additional burden on medical practitioners and to delay access to care\u201d. The AMA said the most concerning amendment was the proposal to require abortions after 22 weeks to be subject of a review by a four-person panel. \u201cThis would place women at significant risk of unnecessary delay and only add to their suffering, particularly women in regional and rural areas,\u201d it said. \u201cIn the vast majority of cases, abortions after 22 weeks arise due to a significant abnormality in the foetus. Families and their doctors already face the most difficult decision of whether to end a wanted pregnancy and these amendments would draw out that process and make it more painful.\u201d It said it was unnecessary legislate to require doctors to receive informed consent as it is already a requirement of doctors, and that changes to conscientious objections changed the status quo as \u201cdoctors already have an obligation not to impede care\u201d. Wendy McCarthy, the chair of the Pro-Choice alliance, said the amendments presented a worse situation than the status quo and would \u201censure that NSW would have some of the most restrictive laws in the country\u201d. \u201cRemoving abortion from the NSW Crimes Act 2019 is the clear goal of the bill currently before NSW parliament. These amendments are a blatant attempt to obstruct that goal,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cA small group of MPs are trying to railroad this important women\u2019s health reform to wind back the clock and impose sanctions and restrictions that are more extreme than current practices.\u201d Earlier on Wednesday senior Liberal party minister Shelley Hancock called the amendments put forward by Speakman and Stokes \u201ca distraction\u201d, accusing her own colleagues of seeking to delay the legislation. Hancock, one of 15 co-sponsors of the bill and another senior moderate in the party, referred to the amendments as \u201ca distraction and a way to possibly defer this bill or oppose it\u201d. \u201cI am always suspicious of those who seek to make amendments because I think it is always a disguised act of trying to defer, delay or defeat a bill such as this,\u201d she said. The amendments and the original bill will now not be voted on until Thursday after debate continued into Wednesday afternoon. The premier, Gladys Berejiklian, is not expected to speak on the bill despite offering her support to the changes. On Tuesday night Speakman told the parliament he believed \u201cthat life begins well before birth, that all life is precious and that the number of abortions in NSW causes me great sorrow\u201d. \u201cBut a focus on the criminal law will not solve this complex issue,\u201d he said. He said the amendments \u201cmaintain choice but also put in place some modest safeguards to address community concerns about its current drafting\u201d. \u201cI am troubled by the lack of reference in the bill to the informed consent of the patient,\u201d he said. \u201cI am troubled by the open-endedness, at least on the face of the bill, for late-term abortions \u2013 whatever might be current medical practice.\u201d Because abortion is regulated by a common law definition, there is currently no distinction between abortions before or after 22 weeks gestation, and in a speech in the NSW parliament on Wednesday Hancock called the focus on late-term abortions \u201ca red herring\u201d. \u201cAll this prevarication about 22 weeks is another distraction,\u201d she said. \u201cOh late-term abortions, late-term abortions, well this bill is actually more strict in its regulation of late-term abortions than the current regulations. That\u2019s another distraction, that\u2019s another red herring thrown into the debate to defer, delay or defeat the bill. \u201cThis is about more safe procedures post 22 weeks. I will listen to the amendments but I haven\u2019t heard anything \u2026 to convince me.\u201d The original bill, introduced by the independent MP Alex Greenwich last week, would remove abortion from the state\u2019s criminal code and make it legal upon request up to 22 weeks. Women beyond 22 weeks gestation would need the consent of two doctors. Despite having the support of MPs from across the major parties, including the premier Gladys Berejiklian and the health minister Brad Hazzard, the bill has been subjected to significant pushback from conservative MPs, the Catholic church and anti-abortion activists. The amendments moved by Speakman and Stokes are being sold as an attempt to placate those opposed to the bill because of the wording over late-term abortions. Medical groups are understood to be opposed to the amendments, seeing them as onerous and unnecessary. In his speech to the parliament on Tuesday, Hazzard said the push for an \u201cinformed consent\u201d provision was unnecessary because doctors were already required to obtain consent under medical regulations. \u201cThe mere mechanical signing of a consent form is, of itself, of limited value,\u201d he said. \u201cI note in passing there are also specific requirements regarding informed consent to minors.

The crisis is being keenly felt, not least after a recent survey on national identity in which 50% of participants cited forests as being central to their idea of heimat or sense of home. Germans have for centuries had a mythological, even spiritual, identification with their forests. Woodlands have formed the inspiration for much German music and literature \u2013most famously the 19th-century folk tales of the Brothers Grimm. In everything from Red Riding Hood to Hansel and Gretel the forest is portrayed as a place of foreboding and threat and as well as retreat, safety and learning. For German romanticists in the late 18th century, the forest was an important symbol of unity and purity, the word waldeinsamkeit, forest loneliness, embodying the sense of inner peace to be found in the forest. This was later exploited by the Nazis, who encouraged the idea of the forest as a sign of German cultural solidity, encouraging people to plant German oaks to honour Adolf Hitler. The tabloid Bild recently published an ode to the German forest, calling it \u201cpart of the German soul\u201d. \u201cIt is, alas, not some made-up fairytale \u2026 that our forest is in a state of emergency \u2026 and if we don\u2019t do something to save it and ourselves, we might end up with the story: \u2018Once upon a time, there was a place called the German forest,\u2019\u201d the paper stated. Experts are divided over the best plan of action. Solutions range from introducing more robust tree species to naturally allowing forests to adapt to the conditions. The opposition Greens are calling for a return to primeval forests \u2013 woods left to their own devices, after researchers at Zurich\u2019s Technical University calculated that there was room on the planet for a third more forests than at present without encroaching on urban or agricultural spaces. While owners of private forests are tending towards planting Douglas firs and northern red oaks, the Association for Environmental and Nature Protection in Germany, a leading NGO, says non-native species are an ecological risk. The trees that are most under threat are said to be spruce, beech, ash, Norway maple and sycamore. Those most able to weather the climate crisis are robinia, plane, and sweet and horse chestnut trees. Among those likely to be increasingly imported in future are Turkish hazel, Italian maple, silver lime, and Lebanon cedar. The challenge is to find species able to cope with hot summers as well as harsh winters. Kl\u00f6ckner believes that as many species as possible are necessary, referring to experts who say nature cannot be left to cope on its own. \u201cWe need mixed forests and trees that are adapted to their habitat,\u201d she said. Tanja Sanders, an expert in forest ecology who researches what the forest of the future might look like, said: \u201cForests are a vital part of our lives. They form groundwater, give us wood, filter the air, reduce CO2 and the temperature and offer space for species conservation and human relaxation. But we must face up to having to say goodbye to the forest as we\u2019ve known it.\u201d",

The rules, from this perspective, are not seen as the nationalist instruments that they are in practice, used not to distribute fairness but to delineate those who understand them from those who do not, for whom they were not written.</p> <p>Antisemitism against white European Jews, undoubtedly a form of racism, nevertheless differs from that experienced by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, black and brown people, migrants and refugees. While these groups are racialised as powerless and invisible within white dominated societies, antisemitism is a racism that envisions itself as \u201cpunching up\u201d.</p> <p>No matter the actual power held by individual Jews, antisemitism construes Jews as having the upper hand over the \u201cordinary\u201d person.</p> <p>The interests of Jews are equated with the interests of capital and the state. Since the birth of the Zionist project and the construction of the State of Israel on land belonging to indigenous Palestinians, Jewishness has also been associated with violent ethno-nationalism and colonialism. The interests of Jews and those of Israel are often conflated, thus erasing anti-Zionist Jews such as myself and countless others acting among Jews both to undo Zionism and expose racism in all its forms, as the <a href=\"https://www.neveragainaction.com/\">Never Again is Now movement</a> in the United States amply demonstrates.</p> <p>Conveniently putting this aside, the dominant message regarding Frydenberg\u2019s section 44 dispute is, as one Twitter user put it to me, that one cannot have \u201ctwo masters\u201d, or a dual allegiance to more than one state.</p> <p>It is clear that Frydenberg\u2019s \u201cmaster\u201d has never been nor will it ever be Hungary, the state which so nearly ended the life of his mother as an infant and from which she was forced to flee, a state which is currently enacting fascistic anti-migrant and anti-Roma policies, and<a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/viktor-orban-anti-semitism-problem-hungary-jews/\"> in which antisemitism is rampant again</a>.</p> <p>The unspoken \u201cother master\u201d then is Israel.</p> <p>Indeed, it has been stated that Israel\u2019s right of return for Jews also contributes to Frydenberg\u2019s ineligibility, although neither he nor his parents have ever been citizens.</p> <p>Yet, the belief that Jews always hold the interests of other Jews, and by association the Jewish state, over those of their country of citizenship is an evergreen trope of antisemitism. Anti-nationalist, diaspora Jews are not helped in combatting this by Israel\u2019s Prime Minister Netanyahu, who claims to be the leader of world Jewry, despite the fact that greater numbers of young Jews outside of Israel are openly eschewing the Zionist project.</p> <p>But these facts are ignored by those for whom antisemitism trips so easily off the tongue. To mention antisemitism is always to weaponise, to mobilise strawmen, and to align with the 1%.</p> <p>There is one thing that those determined to nail Frydenberg have understood about me and other leftwing Jews. We are anti-nationalist; we have <em>no</em> master, never mind two.</p> <p>Mobilising old antisemitic tropes to bring down a political enemy by using rules established by a white colonial nation-state does not contribute to the fight against racism, no matter what we think about Frydenberg\u2019s role in maintaining Australia\u2019s border regime.</p> <p>The long fight against racism and fascism may do well to remember the lesson taught to Frantz Fanon by his teacher: \u2018\u201cWhen you hear someone insulting the Jews pay attention; he is talking about you.\u201d</p> <p>Those fighting to unseat Josh Frydenberg are not our allies in the fight to undo racial-colonial nationalism in Australia.</p> <ul> <li><p>Alana Lentin is an associate professor in cultural and social analysis at Western Sydney University</p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "In response to the news that a challenge has been mounted against Treasurer Josh Frydenberg\u2019s eligibility to sit in the Australian parliament under section 44 of the constitution, \u201cthe rules\u201d have been cited, as have double standards. One of the arguments goes if Labor and Greens parliamentarians were forced to resign their seats because they were found to be dual nationals, it is hypocritical of the government to shield \u201ctheir man\u201d. I have long been critical of the tendency of both sides of Australian politics to mobilise the history of the Holocaust as a defence against criticism of its racist migration policies, the punitive asylum detention regime in particular. It is not lost on me that Josh Frydenberg happily defends his government\u2019s policy of locking up those who seek asylum by boat on Manus Island and Nauru and keeping countless others in limbo \u201con shore\u201d while claiming special status because his mother fled the Nazis and the Hungarian fascists to come to Australia. As Malcolm Turnbull put it when he was prime minister, to legally challenge Frydenberg over his eligibility represents a failure to think \u201ca little deeper about the history of the Holocaust\u201d. In response, the anti-LNP Twitterati, which has made Josh Frydenberg its bete noir, retorts that \u201cmaking it about religion\u201d is cynical, the mounting of a #strawman. Nevertheless, the facts are, as Turnbull put it, that Frydenberg\u2019s mother, Erica Strauss, was born in the Budapest Ghetto in 1943, and although she herself survived the Holocaust, coming to Australia as a refugee in 1950, other family members did not. Neglecting this, the case in favour of stripping Frydenberg of his parliamentary seat rests on the narrow legality: the fact that his mother possessed a Hungarian passport between 1943 and 1948. The rules cannot be broken, even if \u2013 some acquiesce \u2013 they may need to be revisited. But what are the rules in the case of Josh Frydenberg\u2019s eligibility under section 44, and what does the insistence on applying them to him \u201cfairly\u201d mean for how white, self-defined \u201cprogressives\u201d in Australia understand antisemitism? It is curious that some of those welcoming Frydenberg\u2019s potential demise have accused me of picking and choosing to whom the rules apply depending on who \u201cI like\u201d. In the liberal mind, racism is not about systemic discrimination enacted by the state and perpetuated by the dominant culture, but something nebulously to do with in-groups and out-groups. In Australia, the same cult of fairness that insists 200 years of colonial domination can be redressed by giving everyone a \u201cfair go\u201d, upholds \u201cthe rules\u201d as the ultimate arbiters of that fair treatment. The rules, from this perspective, are not seen as the nationalist instruments that they are in practice, used not to distribute fairness but to delineate those who understand them from those who do not, for whom they were not written. Antisemitism against white European Jews, undoubtedly a form of racism, nevertheless differs from that experienced by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, black and brown people, migrants and refugees. While these groups are racialised as powerless and invisible within white dominated societies, antisemitism is a racism that envisions itself as \u201cpunching up\u201d. No matter the actual power held by individual Jews, antisemitism construes Jews as having the upper hand over the \u201cordinary\u201d person. The interests of Jews are equated with the interests of capital and the state. Since the birth of the Zionist project and the construction of the State of Israel on land belonging to indigenous Palestinians, Jewishness has also been associated with violent ethno-nationalism and colonialism. The interests of Jews and those of Israel are often conflated, thus erasing anti-Zionist Jews such as myself and countless others acting among Jews both to undo Zionism and expose racism in all its forms, as the Never Again is Now movement in the United States amply demonstrates. Conveniently putting this aside, the dominant message regarding Frydenberg\u2019s section 44 dispute is, as one Twitter user put it to me, that one cannot have \u201ctwo masters\u201d, or a dual allegiance to more than one state. It is clear that Frydenberg\u2019s \u201cmaster\u201d has never been nor will it ever be Hungary, the state which so nearly ended the life of his mother as an infant and from which she was forced to flee, a state which is currently enacting fascistic anti-migrant and anti-Roma policies, and in which antisemitism is rampant again. The unspoken \u201cother master\u201d then is Israel. Indeed, it has been stated that Israel\u2019s right of return for Jews also contributes to Frydenberg\u2019s ineligibility, although neither he nor his parents have ever been citizens. Yet, the belief that Jews always hold the interests of other Jews, and by association the Jewish state, over those of their country of citizenship is an evergreen trope of antisemitism. Anti-nationalist, diaspora Jews are not helped in combatting this by Israel\u2019s Prime Minister Netanyahu, who claims to be the leader of world Jewry, despite the fact that greater numbers of young Jews outside of Israel are openly eschewing the Zionist project. But these facts are ignored by those for whom antisemitism trips so easily off the tongue. To mention antisemitism is always to weaponise, to mobilise strawmen, and to align with the 1%. There is one thing that those determined to nail Frydenberg have understood about me and other leftwing Jews. We are anti-nationalist; we have no master, never mind two. Mobilising old antisemitic tropes to bring down a political enemy by using rules established by a white colonial nation-state does not contribute to the fight against racism, no matter what we think about Frydenberg\u2019s role in maintaining Australia\u2019s border regime. The long fight against racism and fascism may do well to remember the lesson taught to Frantz Fanon by his teacher: \u2018\u201cWhen you hear someone insulting the Jews pay attention; he is talking about you.\u201d Those fighting to unseat Josh Frydenberg are not our allies in the fight to undo racial-colonial nationalism in Australia.

As advocates use Homelessness Week to ramp up calls for a national homelessness strategy, national figures show that 54,000 people who sought help in 2017-18 were on Newstart. The figure represents a 57% increase from five years earlier in 2012-13, when there were 34,000 people on Newstart who presented at a homelessness agency over the 12 months. \u201cIf we don\u2019t address levels of things like Newstart, and the consequences of living on such low income levels, then we\u2019re only going to see the problems continue to deteriorate,\u201d Sue Cattermole, the St Vincent de Paul Society\u2019s Victorian chief executive, told Guardian Australia.

The shortfall is $82m, and will grow to $96m next year, the peak body said. Jenny Smith, the chair of Homelessness Australia, said the organisation wanted more spending on social housing as well as a national plan that engaged all three levels of government. A department of social services spokeswoman disputed Homelessness Australia\u2019s figures, which she said did not \u201cinclude significant Commonwealth expenditure on social housing and homelessness services\u201d. She cited millions in extra funding for the National Rental Affordability Scheme, and new funding allocated for remote housing, youth homelessness, and social housing in Hobart. Howarth said the government understood \u201chaving a roof over your head is crucial to the welfare of all Australians\u201d. \u201cJust one person forced into homelessness is one too many which is why this government has made tackling the issue a priority,\u201d he said. \u201cThe government is contributing more than $6 billion a year in funding for housing and homelessness to support states and territories in their important work.\u201d The government is yet to commit to such a plan but last month Howarth raised eyebrows when he said his priority would be building more emergency accommodation. \u201cIt\u2019s quite a ridiculous statement,\u201d said Doug Herrington, who has spent years wading through Australia\u2019s complex web of homelessness and housing support systems. \u201cEmergency housing, as much as it\u2019s a good thing, it\u2019s nothing stable, it doesn\u2019t give much hope.\u201d One night in 2011, Herrington, 52, went to bed and woke up three months later. A fire had torn through the Brisbane house where he had been couch surfing, leaving him with third-degree burns from the waist up. When he got out of hospital, he was moved into a supported accommodation complex for people experiencing homelessness. After regaining the strength to walk and do things for himself, Herrington was told by his doctors to move to Melbourne to be closer to his daughter and grandchildren. Last year, he inquired about getting housing in Victoria. \u201cTheir words to me were in order to access the system, you have to first become homeless,\u201d Herrington said.

      "bodyText": "Profits at Australia\u2019s biggest bank, the Commonwealth, have slumped by 8.1% after the bank laid out an extra $1bn to compensate customers it has ripped off. The bank, which was at the centre of a series of financial scandals that helped prompt last year\u2019s Hayne royal commission, has also pledged to shut one of its most troubled divisions, advice group Financial Wisdom, next year. \u201cThe royal commission wreaked havoc on the CBA result,\u201d leading bank analyst Brett Le Mesurier, of stockbroker Shaw and Partners, said. The bank\u2019s $8.57bn profit, which was also driven by falls in income and higher costs across its different businesses, was below market expectations, sending its share price down about 1% on Wednesday. \u201cThis is a soft result,\u201d UBS analyst Jonathan Mott said in a note to clients. He said the market would now expect lower profits from the bank in the future. CBA\u2019s history of misconduct has resulted in a series of investigations and lawsuits that have increased its regulatory and compliance costs \u2013 including a program to improve its governance and culture ordered by the prudential regulator, which the bank has been warned is \u201cat serious risk of not delivering\u201d if the bank does not resource it properly. Chief executive Matt Comyn, who replaced Ian Narev in April last year, said the bank was juggling a number of \u201cregulatory and risk projects\u201d. \u201cBut we have already started work on making sure that we can both maintain the momentum of the program and also retain the on-track status [of the project].\u201d Announcing the results on Wednesday morning, chairwoman Catherine Livingstone also said that the bank planned to stop financing thermal coal mining and electricity generation by 2030, \u201csubject to Australia having a secure energy platform\u201d. Net profit for the year to the end of June fell 8.1% to about $8.57bn, the second year running that the cost of addressing past misbehaviour has eaten into earnings. Using the cash measure preferred by the banking sector, profit fell 4.7% to $8.5bn. \u201cThat cash net profit after tax is of course subdued and it\u2019s been impacted by higher remediation costs of almost $1 billion during the course of the year, as well as elevated risk and compliance spend,\u201d chief executive Matt Comyn said. He said the bank was trying to simplify its structure by selling troubled areas, including wealth management and insurance, and returning to its core business of borrowing and lending money. \u201cWe\u2019re focused on changing our culture and the way we serve our customers,\u201d he said. Despite its profit woes, CBA said it would maintain dividends paid to shareholders, totalling $4.31 per share for the year. CBA said it would close Financial Wisdom, part of a financial planning group where it is spending more than $530m compensating clients hurt by shoddy advice. The bank expects it will have to refund about a quarter of the fees charged by financial planners who worked for this division.

Getting adequate resources would be \u201cpivotal\u201d, Promontory said. \u201cIt has been an ongoing challenge from the start of the program. \u201cThe challenge has intensified in the context of competing priorities which have emerged over the last 12 months.\u201d Dealing with the regulators and the royal commission cost it $155m for the year, the bank said. Le Mesurier said CBA\u2019s costly history of misconduct stretched back \u201cat least a decade\u201d to a time when the bank decided to expand from its traditional business into wealth management. \u201cIt shows there\u2019s no way to escape the consequences of not dealing with all risks appropriately, particularly compliance, and not dealing with all customers appropriately,\u201d he said.",

So I use their words as motivation to train more, to prove to these people that being a hijab girl should not stop me, that I have something here I know I can do well \u2013 no matter what they say.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Spy agency Asio is being urged to make a public submission to a parliamentary inquiry into press freedom, as the government considers whether changes are needed to national security laws to protect journalists. After Asio made a classified submission to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, examining how national security laws are affecting the work of journalists, the Alliance for Journalists\u2019 Freedom is calling for it to make its case publicly. Director of AJF Peter Greste said that while the organisation recognised that Asio needed to keep some elements of its work classified, it should make a separate open submission to the inquiry that did not disclose sensitive information. \u201cThe AJF finds it hard to believe that Asio is unable to provide an open submission to the inquiry without exposing classified operational details,\u201d Greste said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cAsio is effectively saying to the public \u2018trust us\u2019. The best way to build and maintain that trust in a democracy is, while maintaining operation secrecy to the extent necessary, by our agencies being as open and transparent as they are able to be.\u201d The Asio submission cannot be reviewed by any member of the public, and the agency is likely to also give \u201cin camera\u201d evidence to the PJCIS. Media companies, including News Corp, Nine and the ABC, have used their submission to the inquiry to urge the government to unwind the criminalisation of journalism and add safeguards such as a right to front court and contest applications for search warrants against reporters. The parliamentary inquiry was triggered by high-profile raids on News Corp journalist Annika Smethurst and the headquarters of the ABC, prompting concern that journalists could be charged for publishing protected information. Protected information formed the basis of ABC reports of alleged unlawful killings by Australian troops in Afghanistan and plans by the secretive Australian Signals Directorate to extend powers to spy on Australian citizens.

      "bodyText": "The Democratic congresswoman for El Paso has said that Donald Trump \u201cis not welcome here\u201d, one day before the president is set to visit a border city still reeling from one of the deadliest mass shootings in recent US history. \u201cFrom my perspective, he is not welcome here. He should not come here while we are in mourning,\u201d Veronica Escobar, a Democratic freshman member of the House, told MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe program. \u201cI would encourage the president\u2019s staff members to have him do a little self-reflection. I would encourage them to show him his own words and his actions at the rallies.\u201d Trump, who plans to visit the Texas city as well as the scene of another mass shooting in Dayton, Ohio, on Wednesday, has been widely criticized for failing to acknowledge the role of his rhetoric in emboldening white nationalists and fueling hatred of immigrants. A manifesto, allegedly written by the 21-year-old suspect in the El Paso shooting, said the attack was a \u201cresponse to the Hispanic invasion of Texas\u201d. Donald Trump\u2019s own re-election campaign has characterized immigration as an \u201cinvasion\u201d in more than 2,000 Facebook ads this year, according to Guardian analysis. Escobar, who succeeded the 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke to lead the 16th congressional district of Texas, said she saw a connection between the way the gunman saw his victims in Walmart on Saturday and the language Trump uses in describing immigrants as \u201can infestation\u201d and \u201can invasion\u201d. She said she wanted to tell the Republican president: \u201cI need you to acknowledge that you\u2019ve dehumanized people who are good and equal to all of us. And you need to rehumanize everyone.\u201d Later on Tuesday, Escobar announced that she had declined an invitation to join Donald Trump during his visit, after he rebuffed her request to discuss his racist comments about Mexicans and immigrants. Other El Paso officials, too, are urging Trump to reconsider his trip to the city. \u201cRegardless of what happened here on Saturday, he has constantly demonized, vilified the type of people who live in this community,\u201d the El Paso county commissioner, David Stout, told ABC News on Tuesday. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why in the world anybody would think it would be a good idea for him to be in El Paso, Texas.\u201d Adding to El Paso\u2019s ire, the president\u2019s re-election campaign still owes the city more than $500,000. Trump held a February rally at an El Paso arena, and according to the Center for Public Integrity, the campaign has an unpaid balance to the city of $569,204. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous and unconscionable. The city of El Paso is an economically challenged community,\u201d Stout said of the outstanding bill, according to various reports. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be throwing salt into the wound \u2013 a very, very deep wound,\u201d Stout said. \u201cAnd this community needs healing, not Donald Trump.\u201d",

When they finally decided to publish at the recommendation of the US attorney general and Federal Bureau of Investigation, the terrorist screed was packaged with context and analysis. Twenty-four years later, white nationalist terrorists can skip the blackmail and go directly to 8chan to attain notoriety, spread their ideas and inspire copycats. In the first 24 hours after the livestreamed massacre of 51 Muslim worshippers in Christchurch, New Zealand, in March, Facebook removed 1.5m copies of the video. 8chan was founded in 2013 by Fredrick Brennan as an even less restrictive alternative to another notorious message board, 4chan. The site\u2019s popularity exploded in 2014 when 4chan banned discussion of the misogynistic harassment campaign known as Gamergate, prompting a migration of 4chan\u2019s most committed harassers to the newer forum. Brennan and Watkins started working together in 2014, according to a profile by Fusion. Watkins had learned computer skills in the US army, and while serving in the military made money with a side business \u2013 a pornography site and web hosting services catering to adult Japanese sites. He left the army in 1998 and his company, NT Technology, began hosting the popular Japanese message board that inspired 4chan, 2channel, two years later. Watkins eventually took control of that site in 2014. That same year, he offered his assistance to Brennan, who been struggling to keep 8chan functioning. Brennan moved to the Philippines to work with Watkins, who eventually took ownership of 8chan, too. Brennan stopped working for 8chan in 2016 and cut ties in 2018. Brennan has called for the site to be shut down in a number of interviews since the El Paso shooting, arguing that Watkins has failed to manage the site responsibly and even encouraged extremism with decisions such as running the tagline \u201cEmbrace infamy\u201d on the site\u2019s homepage. In the past, Brennan had cheered the site\u2019s involvement in harassment campaigns. The Guardian has contacted Brennan and Watkins for comment. On Monday, Brennan tweeted: \u201cThe only ones who will suffer from 8chan going down are mass shooters who planned to use it as a platform and Jim Watkins.\u201d Watkins\u2019 problems now go beyond his service providers. On Tuesday, the chairman and ranking member of the House committee on homeland security wrote to Watkins demanding that he \u201cprovide testimony regarding 8chan\u2019s efforts to investigate and mitigate the proliferation of extremist content, including white supremacist extremist content, on your website\u201d. \u201cAmericans deserve to know what, if anything, you, as the owner and operator, are doing to address the proliferation of extremist content on 8chan,\u201d representatives Bennie Thompson and Mike Rogers wrote.",

Law enforcement officials said Tuesday that the Dayton shooting did not appear to be linked to a \u201cbias motive\u201d. Authorities are meanwhile investigating the shooting in El Paso \u2013 which left 22 dead, including seven Mexican nationals \u2013 as an act of domestic terrorism. The White House counselor Kellyanne Conway nonetheless lashed out at Democrats and the media for not dedicating more coverage to the Dayton suspect\u2019s political views. \u201cLet me tell you something, I\u2019m hopping mad this morning because I see very little, scant coverage that this Dayton shooter has been confirmed as having a Twitter feed that was supportive of Antifa, that was supportive of Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders,\u201d Conway said during an appearance on Fox &amp; Friends, one of the network\u2019s most prominent boosters of Trump. The White House spokesman Hogan Gidley echoed the critique later in the day in his own interview with Fox News, stating: \u201cIt is disgusting to watch so many on the left come before cameras within five hours of this tragedy and lie about this president and have pathetic comments about the state of this country and where the president stands.\u201d \u201cWe do not blame, nor do we even dream of blaming Elizabeth Warren for the shooter in Ohio who wanted to vote for her,\u201d he added, while listing off other acts of violence allegedly committed by individuals who appeared to support Democratic politicians. \u201cThat is ridiculous. We wouldn\u2019t dream of doing it and you cannot apply that standard to us and ignore it on the Democrats\u2019 side.\u201d Warren\u2019s team issued a statement on Tuesday evening, arguing that the attacks were a \u201cdistraction\u201d. \u201cLet\u2019s be clear \u2013 there is a direct line between the president\u2019s rhetoric and the stated motivations of the El Paso shooter. This is an attempt to distract from the fact that Trump\u2019s rhetoric is inciting violence as extremist-related murders have spiked 35 percent from 2017 to 2018,\u201d the statement read. Trump has routinely targeted nonwhite immigrants, Muslims and other minorities at his rallies and pushed conspiracy theories to stoke fears around immigration. The suspect in El Paso expressed fears about a \u201cHispanic invasion\u201d of the US, using the same language often employed by Trump and Fox News. There is meanwhile no evidence at this stage to suggest that the Dayton suspect\u2019s leftwing views had any bearing on his decision to open fire on a crowded street early Sunday, killing nine people and injuring 27 more. Addressing the massacres on Monday, Trump denounced racism and white supremacy in a speech that did not include any calls for new gun laws. The president, who is poised to visit Dayton and El Paso on Wednesday, has since expressed frustration over his anti-immigrant rants coming under scrutiny. Earlier on Tuesday, Trump directed his ire at Barack Obama for issuing a statement on the shootings. \u201cDid George Bush ever condemn President Obama after Sandy Hook. President Obama had 32 mass shootings during his reign. Not many people said Obama is out of Control,\u2019\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201c\u2018Mass shootings were happening before the President even thought about running for Pres.\u201d Trump was paraphrasing comments made by the Fox &amp; Friends host Brian Kilmeade, a vocal supporter of the president. \u201cI am the least racist person,\u201d Trump added. \u201cBlack, Hispanic and Asian Unemployment is the lowest (BEST) in the history of the United States!\u201d In a statement issued Monday, Obama did not invoke Trump directly but pointedly rebuked rhetoric from elected officials that \u201cnormalizes racist sentiments\u201d. \u201cWe should soundly reject language coming out of the mouths of any of our leaders that feeds a climate of fear and hatred or normalizes racist sentiments; leaders who demonize those who don\u2019t look like us, or suggest that other people, including immigrants, threaten our way of life, or refer to other people as sub-human, or imply that America belongs to just one certain type of people,\u201d Obama wrote.",

This president recognizes the gravity of this moment,\u201d Gidley said, according to a pool report. \u201cHe shares their sadness, but he also shares in this anger.\u201d<br></p> <p>Gidley then pivoted to dismissing any notion that Trump was responsible for intensifying racist sentiments in the country. \u201cThere are plenty of people in this country who commit acts of evil in the names of politicians, of celebrities and all types of things,\u201d Gidley said.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the politician\u2019s fault when someone acts out their evil intention. I\u2019ll just have to say, we would never dream of blaming <strong>Elizabeth Warren</strong> for the shooter who supports Elizabeth Warren,\u201d Gidley continued. \u201cWe would never dream of blaming <strong>[Alexandria] Ocasio-Cortez </strong>for someone who perpetrated a terrorist attack on a DHS ICE facility because he used the same rhetoric she uses about concentration camps. We would also never blame <strong>Barack Obama</strong> for the police shootings in Dallas. We wouldn\u2019t blame <strong>Bernie Sanders</strong> for the shooting of <strong>Steve Scalise</strong> or other Republicans. And quite frankly, it\u2019s ridiculous to make those connect in some way. ... You have to blame the people here who pulled the trigger.\u201d</p> <p>Those comments severely downplay how closely the El Paso shooter\u2019s language of a \u201cHispanic invasion\u201d mirrors Trump\u2019s.

      "bodyText": "The El Paso representative Veronica Escobar has declined an invitation to join Trump during his visit tomorrow. She and other El Paso officials have urged Trump to reconsider his trip. The president also plans to visit Dayton tomorrow. Puerto Rico\u2019s supreme court is mulling over who will get to be the island\u2019s next governor. Tensions between the Trump administration and the Venezuelan president Nicol\u00e1s Maduro have continued to escalate. Venezuela\u2019s UN representative accused the White House of trying to start a war, as national security adviser John Bolton doubled down on opposition to Maduro\u2019s leadership. The FBI said investigators have uncovered evidence that the Dayton shooter explored \u201cviolent ideologies\u201d. The bureau has opened an investigation alongside the Dayton police department\u2019s homicide investigation. White House aides have sought to elevate reports that the Dayton gunman supported leftwing ideas and endorsed 2020 candidates Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, but the FBI said the shooter did not appear to be linked to a \u201cbias motive\u201d. The FBI has also launched a domestic terrorism investigation into the Gilroy garlic festival shooting. The northern California attack left three victims dead last week, and authorities said the shooter had a broad \u201ctarget list\u201d that included religious institutions and organizations connected to both major political parties. Trump\u2019s re-election campaign and the Republican party have filed a lawsuit challenging a new California law requiring presidential candidates to release their tax returns to appear on the state\u2019s primary ballot. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s team has released a statement responding to reports that the Dayton gunman was a supporter, saying they\u2019re a \u201cdistraction\u201d. As the Guardian\u2019s Sabrina Siddiqui reported earlier, the White House has attempted to deflect blame onto Democrats and the media. In interviews with Fox News on Tuesday, the president\u2019s aides repeatedly rejected assertions that the suspect in El Paso, who allegedly authored a hate-filled manifesto echoing Trump\u2019s incendiary language on immigration, may have been influenced or emboldened by the president. They instead sought to elevate reports that the gunman in Dayton, Ohio, allegedly shared leftwing posts on social media and supported the 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren. Law enforcement officials said Tuesday that the Dayton shooting did not appear to be linked to a \u201cbias motive\u201d. Authorities are meanwhile investigating the shooting in El Paso \u2013 which left 22 dead, including seven Mexican nationals \u2013 as an act of domestic terrorism. The White House counselor Kellyanne Conway nonetheless lashed out at Democrats and the media for not dedicating more coverage to the Dayton suspect\u2019s political views. \u201cLet me tell you something, I\u2019m hopping mad this morning because I see very little, scant coverage that this Dayton shooter has been confirmed as having a Twitter feed that was supportive of Antifa, that was supportive of Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders,\u201d Conway said during an appearance on Fox &amp; Friends, one of the network\u2019s most prominent boosters of Trump. Puerto Rico\u2019s supreme court is now mulling over who will become the island\u2019s next governor. Pedro Pierluisi, the disgraced governor\u2019s Ricardo Rossello\u2019s handpicked successor, is facing off against the senate president, Thomas Rivera Schatz, who filed a constitutional challenge over Pierluisi\u2019s appointment. Here\u2019s where it gets a bit wonky. Pierluisi was appointed secretary of state, second in command to the governor, last week \u2013 and was approved by the Puerto Rico house of representatives but not the senate \u2013 which was on summer recess. Pierluisi was then sworn in as governor, filling the vacuum left by Rossello. A lawsuit from the senator seeks an injunction ordering Pierluisi to immediately step down from the governor\u2019s office since he wasn\u2019t approved by both legislative bodies. From The AP: If the Supreme Court finds in favor of the Senate, Justice Secretary Wanda V\u00e1zquez would become governor, though she has said she doesn\u2019t want the job... Some Puerto Ricans were dismayed that after a mass protest movement successfully led to the resignation of Gov. Ricardo Rossell\u00f3, the question of his successor now lies in the hands of a court. \u201cIt was a possible outcome, but certainly sad because for three weeks the island took to the streets in a historic, forceful way to peacefully overthrow a governor, and now this is left to a majority of nine people who are also nine people named and approved by politicians?\u201d said Sen. Juan Dalmau of the Puerto Rican Independence Party. \u201cThat is another constitutional defect.\u201d Dalmau submitted a bill Tuesday that would allow Puerto Rico to hold a special election if a governor were to step down, saying it\u2019s a move to uphold democracy. The 2020 Democratic presidential candidate and New York mayor Bill de Blasio has announced $9m in new funding to support the community in Brownsville, Brooklyn, where one man was killed and 11 were injured after a gunman opened fire at an annual block party last week. The funding will bolster existing programs to prevent gun violence and promote neighborhood safety, including money to renovate the community center, and install more security cameras and lighting around the Brownsville Playground. \u201cThese programs will build on our commitment to end the epidemic of gun violence and lend much-needed support to the local leaders and activists who work to bring positive, enduring change to the Brownsville community each and every day,\u201d de Blasio said in a statement. Representative Veronica Escobar says she has declined an invitation to join Donald Trump during his visit to El Paso tomorrow after he rebuked her request to speak to him about his racist comments about Mexicans and immigrants. \u201cI was told that @realDonaldTrump is \u2018too busy\u2019 to have that conversation,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cTomorrow, I will again be spending time with fellow El Pasoans who are dealing with the pain and horror left in the wake of this act of domestic terrorism fueled by hate and racism.\u201d FBI agent Peter Strzok, who once helped oversee the agency\u2019s investigation into Russian election interference and of Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails and was fired over text messages he sent disparaging Trump, is filing a lawsuit over his dismissal. The AP reports: The suit from Peter Strzok also alleges he was unfairly punished for expressing his political opinions, and that the Justice Department violated his privacy when it shared hundreds of his text messages with reporters. \u201cThis campaign to publicly vilify Special Agent Strzok contributed to the FBI\u2019s ultimate decision to unlawfully terminate him,\u201d the lawsuit says, \u201cas well as to frequent incidents of public and online harassment and threats of violence to Strzok and his family that began when the texts were first disclosed to the media and continue to this day.\u201d Venezuela\u2019s UN ambassador is accusing the Trump administration of trying to start a war by sabotaging talks between Nichol\u00e1s Maduro and his opposition, as the Trump administration\u2019s national security adviser John Bolton doubled down on his view that \u201cMaduro has to go\u201d, according to the Associated Press. Bolton warned today that the US could retaliate against foreign governments and companies that continue to do business with Maduro\u2019s government, after the White House froze all Venezuelan government assets yesterday. From the Guardian report earlier today: Addressing a summit on Venezuela\u2019s crisis in Peru\u2019s capital, Lima, Bolton pronounced Maduro\u2019s \u201cdying regime\u201d doomed \u2013 even though a seven-month US-backed campaign has so far failed to topple Hugo Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s authoritarian successor. Bolton claimed Donald Trump\u2019s latest moves \u2013 which will also see those who do business with Maduro\u2019s government sanctioned \u2013 would help end \u201cMaduro\u2019s tyrannical reign\u201d. \u201cThe time for dialogue is over. Now is the time for action,\u201d Bolton declared, spurning Norway-sponsored negotiations that have been taking place between representatives of Maduro and his US-backed challenger, Juan Guaid\u00f3. But experts questioned the impact and wisdom of the measures, which Maduro\u2019s administration and its Russian backers branded \u201ceconomic terrorism\u201d. Some fear the latest sanctions will further aggravate an already dire humanitarian situation which has already forced millions to flee Venezuela, while others believe they will alienate Guaid\u00f3\u2019s European backers who believe a negotiated solution is possible. Two members of Congress have sent a letter to the National Archives seeking records related to the supreme court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. \u201cIn the coming year, the supreme court will again address important matters regarding civil rights, criminal justice, and immigration,\u201d reads the letter, authored by the New York congressman and House judiciary committee chairman Jerrold Nadler and the Georgia congressman Hank Johnson. The records from Kavanaugh\u2019s time serving as White House staff secretary during George W Bush\u2019s administration and in the White House counsel\u2019s office would help lawmakers fine-tune legislation that would create a professional ethics code for supreme court justices, according to the congressmen. The Judicial Conduct and Disability Act allows for complaints against federal judges but doesn\u2019t apply to supreme court justices. Dozens of complaints against Kavanaugh, including allegations that he made false and partisan statements during his supreme court confirmation hearings last year, were dismissed after he was confirmed to the nation\u2019s highest court. During the hearings, Kavanaugh denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr Christine Blasey Ford in the 1980s, when they were both teenagers, and levied partisan attacks against Democratic senators. His conduct last year and during testimony he gave more than a decade ago as a nominee to become a federal appeals court judge inspired 83 complaints. During Kavanaugh\u2019s controversial supreme court confirmation process, then-chairman of the Senate judiciary committee Chuck Grassley ultimately withdrew a request to the National Archives for information related to Kavanaugh\u2019s time in the White House counsel\u2019s office after obtaining hundreds of thousands of documents from a private attorney overseeing Kavanaugh\u2019s records. That\u2019s it from me on the blog today. Maanvi Singh will be taking things over on the west coast for the next few hours. Here is where the day stands so far: The FBI said investigators have uncovered evidence that the Dayton shooter explored \u201cviolent ideologies\u201d. The bureau has opened an investigation alongside the Dayton police department\u2019s homicide investigation. The FBI has also launched a domestic terrorism investigation into the Gilroy garlic festival shooting. The northern California attack left three victims dead last week, and authorities said the shooter had a broad \u201ctarget list\u201d that included religious institutions and organizations connected to both major political parties. The White House sought to deflect blame away from Trump for the mass shootings by connecting prominent Democrats to other recent attacks. \u201cIt\u2019s not the politician\u2019s fault when someone acts out their evil intention,\u201d the White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said. \u201cI\u2019ll just have to say, we would never dream of blaming Elizabeth Warren for the shooter who supports Elizabeth Warren.\u201d El Paso officials, including the representative Veronica Escobar, have urged Trump to reconsider his trip to the city tomorrow. \u201cFrom my perspective, he is not welcome here. He should not come here while we are in mourning,\u201d Escobar said. (The president also plans to visit Dayton tomorrow.) Trump\u2019s re-election campaign and the Republican party have filed a lawsuit challenging a new California law requiring presidential candidates to release their tax returns to appear on the state\u2019s primary ballot. Maanvi will have more on the continuing fallout from the shootings, as well as other developments on Capitol Hill, so stay tuned. El Paso officials continue to urge Trump to reconsider his trip to the city tomorrow as the city mourns those lost in an attack targeting Hispanic Americans. \u201cRegardless of what happened here on Saturday, he has constantly demonized, vilified the type of people who live in this community,\u201d the El Paso county commissioner David Stout said. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why in the world anybody would think it would be a good idea for him to be in El Paso, Texas.\u201d Mike Turner, the Republican who represents Dayton in the House, announced he would support legislation to limit the sale of certain types of guns after the shooting in his district. \u201cI strongly support the Second Amendment, but we must prevent mentally unstable people from terrorizing our communities with military style weapons,\u201d Turner said in a statement. \u201cI will support legislation that prevents the sale of military style weapons to civilians, a magazine limit, and red flag legislation. The carnage these military style weapons are able to produce when available to the wrong people is intolerable.\u201d Ohio\u2019s Republican governor, Mike DeWine, said in a press conference earlier today that he would similarly urge the state legislature to consider a \u201cred flag\u201d law, which would allow judges to take guns away from people deemed dangerous. Authorities in Ohio provided an update on the investigation into the Dayton attack, revealing that they have uncovered evidence the shooter explored \u201cviolent ideologies\u201d. Todd Wickerham of the FBI would not provide specifics on what ideologies the shooter had delved into, but he said the evidence was strong enough for the bureau to open an investigation alongside the Dayton police department\u2019s homicide investigation. He added that investigators had not found \u201cany indication\u201d of a racial motivation in the attack. Wickerham added that the bureau is seeking to uncover if any ideology motivated him, if anyone helped him plan the shooting and why he carried out the attack. The Republican representative Devin Nunes is suing his constituents \u2013 and one of his 2020 challengers is helping pay their legal fees. Phil Arballo, one of the Democrats challenging Nunes for his seat in 2020, said his campaign will help raise money for their legal defense fund. \u201cThe central valley is my home. I am a constituent of this district so I am very troubled that a representative would sue his own constituents,\u201d Arballo said in an interview. In a press conference, the Democratic hopeful went further, calling Nunes \u201cunhinged\u201d. The decision to bring this lawsuit, Arballo said, was evidence that the Republican is \u201cdishonest, unethical, lacks integrity and is unfit to serve as a United States congressman representing this district\u201d. The suit \u2013 one of several Nunes has filed against his critics \u2013 stems from a 2018 effort to challenge the congressman\u2019s designation as a \u201cfarmer\u201d on his California ballot listing. After Esquire magazine reported that the Nunes family dairy farm moved from California to Iowa in 2006, critics accused him of being a \u201cfake farmer\u201d and the Democratic group, Red to Blue, petitioned to change his designation. A judge ultimately ruled that the Republican could continue to call himself a farmer. Among those named in the lawsuit, filed by Nunes\u2019 campaign, is retired local fruit tree farmer Paul Buxman, one of the congressman\u2019s constituents, and three other defendants. The suit accuses the defendants of conspiring with \u201cdark money\u201d groups to hurt his 2018 re-election campaign. Nunes has become a lightening rod on the left for his unwavering loyalty to the president and his sharp attack on the intelligence community. In 2018, he narrowly held on to his seat as voters in Republican districts across the state elected Democrats. The American Civil Liberties Union has followed through on its promise to legally challenge the Trump administration\u2019s move to expand fast-track deportations. The White House announced late last month that they would be expanding expedited deportations to potentially apply to all undocumented immigrants who could not prove they had continuously been in the country for two years. Previously such fast-track proceedings were only used with migrants who were apprehended shortly after crossing the US-Mexico border. At the time the policy was announced, the ACLU denounced the policy shift as a gross violation of immigrants\u2019 rights. \u201cUnder this unlawful plan, immigrants who have lived here for years would be deported with less due process than people get in traffic court,\u201d said Omar Jawdat, director of the ACLU\u2019s Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project. A new poll from Quinnipiac University found that Elizabeth Warren has enjoyed a bump in support since the second debates, even as Joe Biden remains the front-runner. Warren\u2019s support has jumped from 15 percent in a July 29 survey to 21 percent in the latest poll. Biden has remained relatively steady, with his support dropping from 34 percent last month to 32 percent this month. Bernie Sanders enjoyed a small bump from 11 percent to 14 percent, while Kamala Harris has dropped from 12 percent late last month to 7 percent in the latest poll. A White House spokesperson dodged the question when asked what specific executive action Trump was considering taking to reduce gun violence. \u201cWell, look, he\u2019s looking at all options,\u201d Hogan Gidley told Fox News. White House officials said yesterday that Trump and Attorney General William Barr are \u201cresolved\u201d to take action after the shootings. But the administration has so far been very vague about what that action would look like, only saying that the president is exploring solutions \u201cthat actually make an impact.\u201d The FBI announced at a news conference that the bureau is opening a domestic terrorism investigation into the shooting at the Gilroy garlic festival, which left three victims dead in northern California last week. Authorities said that the shooter had a broad \u201ctarget list\u201d that included religious institutions, federal buildings and organizations associated with both major political parties. John Bennett, the special agent in charge of the FBI\u2019s San Francisco office, said authorities have not yet uncovered a motive in attack. But he said that investigators had found the 19-year-old shooter delved into \u201cviolent ideologies.\u201d Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez demanded an explanation from Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell after a group of young men wearing shirts advertising his campaign were shown in a photo groping and choking a cutout of the congresswoman. Lauren Aratani reports: It is not clear who is shown in the picture, but it appears the men were attending an annual picnic in Fancy Farm, a small town in Kentucky, where McConnell made an appearance. The senator\u2019s campaign Instagram account shared a series of photos with a few of the young men, among others, holding cardboard cutouts of two of the supreme court\u2019s conservative justices, Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch. McConnell\u2019s campaign said in a statement to the Washington Post that the men were high schoolers and not part of the campaign staff. The campaign \u201cin no way condones\u201d the picture, the statement added. Trump has received criticism in the past few days for not taking responsibility for how his anti-immigrant rhetoric has inflamed racism in America. The White House is now dealing with that criticism by invoking other recent shootings and connecting them to prominent Democrats. White House spokesperson Hogan Gidley told reporters that the president was spending his day, which included no public events, \u201cmeeting with staff on a wide range of policies\u201d and \u201chaving conversations in prepping\u201d for his trips to El Paso and Dayton tomorrow. \u201cThis is a very, very serious moment in our country\u2019s history. This president recognizes the gravity of this moment,\u201d Gidley said, according to a pool report. \u201cHe shares their sadness, but he also shares in this anger.\u201d Gidley then pivoted to dismissing any notion that Trump was responsible for intensifying racist sentiments in the country. \u201cThere are plenty of people in this country who commit acts of evil in the names of politicians, of celebrities and all types of things,\u201d Gidley said. \u201cIt\u2019s not the politician\u2019s fault when someone acts out their evil intention. I\u2019ll just have to say, we would never dream of blaming Elizabeth Warren for the shooter who supports Elizabeth Warren,\u201d Gidley continued. \u201cWe would never dream of blaming [Alexandria] Ocasio-Cortez for someone who perpetrated a terrorist attack on a DHS ICE facility because he used the same rhetoric she uses about concentration camps. We would also never blame Barack Obama for the police shootings in Dallas. We wouldn\u2019t blame Bernie Sanders for the shooting of Steve Scalise or other Republicans. And quite frankly, it\u2019s ridiculous to make those connect in some way. ... You have to blame the people here who pulled the trigger.\u201d Those comments severely downplay how closely the El Paso shooter\u2019s language of a \u201cHispanic invasion\u201d mirrors Trump\u2019s. The president has not only repeatedly made similar comments, but he has actively campaigned on such rhetoric. Trump\u2019s re-election campaign has described immigration as an \u201cinvasion\u201d in more than 2,000 Facebook ads this year, as our colleague Julia Carrie Wong reported yesterday. Barack Obama wrote on Twitter a touching tribute to Toni Morrison, the award-winning author who died last night at the age of 88. Obama awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Morrison in 2012, one of a number of accolades -- including a Nobel prize -- that Morrison won over her long life. Richard Lea and Sian Cain write of the author: Born in an Ohio steel town in the depths of the Great Depression, Morrison carved out a literary home for the voices of African Americans, first as an acclaimed editor and then with novels such as The Bluest Eye, Song of Solomon and Beloved. ... Describing her as \u2018our adored mother and grandmother\u2019, Morrison\u2019s family said in a statement: \u2018Although her passing represents a tremendous loss, we are grateful she had a long, well lived life. While we would like to thank everyone who knew and loved her, personally or through her work, for their support at this difficult time, we ask for privacy as we mourn this loss to our family.\u2019 Presidential candidate Bernie Sanders also expressed sorrow over Morrison\u2019s passing: As did Representative Ilhan Omar: When Veronica Escobar got the mass shooting memo... The document landed in Texas Congresswoman Veronica Escobar\u2019s email just hours after a gunman killed 22 people in an El Paso, Texas, Walmart, three days ago. It was a best-practices guide, of sorts, to a grim duty, titled \u201cShooting tragedy: Dealing with a crisis.\u201d Updated by members of Congress and their staffs and quietly passed around Capitol Hill for years, the how-to guidance was shared over the weekend with Escobar, a freshman Democrat and the latest member of a group of lawmakers charged with leading after mass shootings in their districts. But as Escobar is learning, no guide to the logistics of crisis management is preparation enough for the sights and sounds of this specific kind of mayhem in one\u2019s hometown. Yesterday, two days after the shooting massacre, Escobar\u2019s voice wavered, in a telephone interview with the Associated Press, as she recounted the story of a man who got a phone call from his wife, one of the Walmart victims. She had been shot in the legs and could not find their daughter. Both survived, Escobar said. \u201cThe one detail I keep hearing over and over again is: \u2018He did not see them as people.\u2019 They were not human beings to him,\u201d she said of the shooter, who is in custody. Earlier today Escobar said she does not feel that Donald Trump is welcome in El Paso, when he plans a visit to the city tomorrow. The law signed last week by Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom is aimed at prying loose Donald Trump\u2019s tax returns, which he has refused to release, saying they are under audit. California\u2019s law requires candidates for president and governor to release five years of tax returns to appear on the state\u2019s primary ballot. It does not include a similar requirement for the general election, the AP writes. California holds its 2020 presidential primary on March 3. The lawsuits filed today argue the law violates the US Constitution by creating an extra requirement to run for president and deprives citizens the right to vote for their chosen candidates. The Constitution puts just three requirements on presidential candidates: that they are natural born citizens, 35 or older and a US resident for at least 14 years. Trump counsel Jay Sekulow called the law \u201cflagrantly illegal,\u201d and said voters already spoke in 2016 on whether Trump should release his tax returns. \u201cThe effort to deny California voters the opportunity to cast a ballot for President Trump in 2020 will clearly fail,\u201d said Sekulow. The Trump campaign and the Republican Party today have sued California over a new law requiring presidential candidates to release their tax returns if they want to run in the state\u2019s primary. One of the lawsuits contends California\u2019s law is \u201ca naked political attack against the sitting President of the United States.\u201d More on this shortly.... Texas Congresswoman says Trump not welcome in El Paso Veronica Escobar, the Democratic freshman member of the House, who succeeded 2020 candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke to lead the 16th Congressional district of Texas, says Donald Trump isn\u2019t welcome in El Paso tomorrow. \u201cFrom my perspective, he is not welcome here. He should not come here while we are in mourning,\u201d Escobar told MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d program on Tuesday. She added: \u201cI would encourage the president\u2019s staff members to have him do a little self-reflection. I would encourage them to show him his own words and his actions at the rallies.\u201d Now, she says she won\u2019t attend Trump\u2019s visit to the city on Wednesday, which is in her district, unless she had \u201cthe opportunity to talk directly to him,\u201d the AP writes. What would she say? She sees a connection between the way the gunman saw his victims in Walmart on Saturday and the language Trump uses to talk about immigrants as \u201can infestation\u201d and \u201can invasion\u201d. She said she would tell the Republican president: \u201cI need you to acknowledge that you\u2019ve dehumanized people who are good and equal to all of us. And you need to re-humanize everyone.\u201d Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Democrats continue to push Mitch McConnell to take up the background checks bill that has already passed the House after this weekend\u2019s shootings in El Paso and Dayton. Dayton\u2019s mayor, Nan Whaley, said that she was \u201cdisappointed\u201d with Trump\u2019s statement yesterday and that the president has been \u201cunhelpful\u201d on gun issues. The Ohio governor urged the state legislature to consider a \u201cred flag\u201d law that would allow judges to take weapons from people deemed dangerous. Trump cited a Fox &amp; Friends segment to criticize Barack Obama after the former president issued a statement urging Americans to \u201csoundly reject language\u201d from any leader who \u201cfeeds a climate of fear and hatred or normalizes racist sentiments.\u201d Jon Huntsman is resigning as the US ambassador to Russia. The former Utah governor, who left office with a sky-high approval rating in 2009, is reportedly considering another gubernatorial bid. The blog is monitoring more fallout from the shootings, as well as Mike Pence\u2019s meeting with the British foreign secretary this afternoon, so stay tuned. Nan Whaley, the mayor of Dayton, expressed hope that Trump would use his visit tomorrow to \u201cbring people together\u201d while noting she was \u201cdisappointed\u201d with his statement on this weekend\u2019s shootings. \u201cEveryone has it in their power to be a force to bring people together, and everybody has it in their power to be a force to bring people apart,\u201d Whaley said in response to a question about Trump\u2019s visit. \u201cThat\u2019s up to the president of the United States.\u201d Whaley added that she has \u201cno sense of what\u2019s in President Trump\u2019s mind at all.\u201d \u201cI can only hope that, as president of the United States, that he\u2019s coming here because he wants to add value to our community,\u201d Whaley said. \u201cThat\u2019s all I can hope.\u201d But Whaley admitted she was \u201cdisappointed\u201d with Trump\u2019s comments yesterday. \u201cI think they fell really short,\u201d the mayor said. \u201cHe mentioned gun issues like one time.\u201d She told reporters that she intended to discuss with Trump \u201chow unhelpful he\u2019s been on this.\u201d \u201cYesterday, his comments weren\u2019t very helpful to the issue around guns,\u201d Whaley said. She was also exasperated with Trump\u2019s confusion of Dayton and Toledo. \u201cMy immediate reaction is, people from the coasts never understand Ohio, and they think all Ohio cities are the same,\u201d Whaley said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s an exhausting issue that we have all the time.\u201d A coalition of progressive groups are currently holding a rally against white supremacy and gun violence in Washington\u2019s Lafayette Square, just in front of the White House. \u201cThe impact of Trump\u2019s racist rhetoric and policies cannot be ignored when white supremacists\u2014 many of whom name him in their attacks and cite him in their hate manifestos\u2014 murder innocent people of color,\u201d the groups said in a statement before the rally. \u201cIt is not enough for Republican leadership in Congress to offer thoughts and prayers, nor should they repeatedly blame gun violence on mental illness \u2014 an unfounded and harmful trope. They must unequivocally denounce this violence, pass laws to stop it, and prevent the rise of white supremacy.\u201d The participating groups are Voto Latino, the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, MoveOn, Labor Council For Latin American Advancement, United We Dream, Service Employees International Union, Planned Parenthood Action Fund, NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, American Federation of Teachers, Muslim Advocates, March for Our Lives, Human Rights Campaign and Interfaith Alliance. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer appeared alongside Representative Pete King, a Republican, to demand that Mitch McConnell take up the background checks bill on guns that has already passed the House. \u201cEnough is enough,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cWe are calling on Leader McConnell to bring the bill that passed the House, that Peter King bravely sponsored, to the floor of the Senate ASAP. If that bill comes to the floor of the Senate, I believe it will pass.\u201d One of Schumer\u2019s Democratic colleagues, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, issued this ultimatum to McConnell: \u201cLead or get out of the way.\u201d \u201cGun violence prevention will be on the ballot again next November in 2020,\u201d Blumenthal also warned. \u201cAnd if you are on the wrong side of this issue, you are going down.\u201d The FBI Agents Association, which represents 14,000 active and former agents, has issued a statement urging Congress to take action on domestic terrorism. \u201cDomestic terrorism is a threat to the American people and our democracy. Acts of violence intended to intimidate civilian populations or to influence or affect government policy should be prosecuted as domestic terrorism regardless of the ideology behind them,\u201d the statement read. \u201cFBIAA continues to urge Congress to make domestic terrorism a federal crime. This would ensure that FBI Agents and prosecutors have the best tools to fight domestic terrorism.\u201d Jon Huntsman, the US ambassador to Russia who has reportedly been mulling a gubernatorial run in Utah, sent his resignation letter to Trump this morning. The resignation is effective Oct. 3, at which point he will return to Utah, the Salt Lake Tribune reports. \u201cAmerican citizenship is a privilege and I believe the most basic responsibility in return is service to country,\u201d Huntsman wrote in his resignation letter. \u201cTo that end, I am honored by the trust you have placed in me as the United States ambassador to Russia during this historically difficult period in bilateral relations.\u201d Huntsman previously served as Utah\u2019s governor and left office in 2009 to become the US ambassador to China. At the time, he had an approval rating that topped 80 percent. Huntsman has served in Russia for two years and has overseen a turbulent period in America\u2019s relationship with the Kremlin as more details have emerged about the country\u2019s interference in the 2016 presidential election. Mike Gravel, the former Alaska senator who tried to make it to the Democratic debate stage with the odd promise that he would not actually seek the nomination, has dropped out and endorsed Bernie Sanders. The campaign issued the announcement with a Twitter video of Gravel speaking directly to the camera from his California home. \u201cMy name is Mike Gravel. I\u2019m proud, and honored, to endorse Senator Bernie Sanders for the presidency of the United States,\u201d Gravel said. But he noted that other 2020 candidates had also garnered his appreciation over the course of his short-lived campaign. \u201cWe really like Tulsi Gabbard, Elizabeth Warren, Marianne Williamson, and Andrew Yang,\u201d he said. \u201cWe love Bernie but have such a deep respect for each of them, despite any disagreements we might have. We hope that they all find their way into government at some point.\u201d David Oks and Henry Williams, the two New York teenagers who served as Gravel\u2019s campaign manager and chief of staff, noted that Gravel attracted the 65,000 donations necessary to make the July debate stage. They blamed Gravel not making the cut on the Democratic National Committee \u201cfavoring polling over grassroots fundraising.\u201d \u201cWe were sad that Senator Gravel wasn\u2019t included in the debates despite a massive grassroots upswell of donations, but it was an honor to work for such a great man,\u201d Oks said in a statement. \u201cThis campaign is ultimately a tribute to a true American hero.\u201d Washington Governor Jay Inslee, who is also running for president, is releasing a 10-point plan specifically aimed at reducing gun violence by white nationalists, CBS News reports. The plan includes more general proposals backed by fellow 2020 Democrats, including a national assault weapons ban. But it also specifically targets white nationalists with proposals to create a system to track such extremists and increasing federal funding for \u201cde-radicalization programs, intervention grants, and investigative resources.\u201d \u201cNo one in America should ever live in fear because of the color of their skin, where they were born, or who they love.\u201d Inslee said in a statement. \u201cWe need a president who will take on the twin epidemics of rising white nationalism and rising gun violence that have cost too many American lives.\u201d Like other candidates, Inslee also slammed Trump\u2019s statement yesterday on the mass shootings at the weekend in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, as woefully lacking. He called the president\u2019s address from the White House \u201can embarrassing attempt to avoid responsibility for his own actions.\u201d Inslee added: \u201cIt\u2019s time for Donald Trump to take ownership for his encouragement of hate and violence in America. \u201cFrom hateful chants at his rallies, to racist tweets, to praise for white nationalists, this president has done more to divide the United States than any leader in modern history.\u201d Joe Biden is advocating for a federal gun buyback program to help get weapons off the streets. The presidential candidate and former vice president has also proposed strengthening the background checks system and reinstating the assault weapons ban. \u201cThe Second Amendment doesn\u2019t say you can\u2019t restrict the kinds of weapons people can own,\u201d Biden said in an interview last night with CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper. \u201cYou can\u2019t buy a bazooka. You can\u2019t have a flamethrower.\u201d But Biden did not go as far as other Democratic presidential candidates when it came to labeling Trump himself a white nationalist. \u201cClearly his actions have done nothing to do anything other than encourage this behavior,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what this guy believes. If he believes anything.\u201d But Biden was very clear on labeling attacks such as the one in El Paso as domestic terrorism. \u201cThe white supremacists, they\u2019re winning the battle,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is domestic terrorism.\u201d Ohio Governor Mike DeWine released a list of 10 items he is asking the state legislature to consider to reduce gun violence. Two days after the governor was confronted with shouts of \u201cDo something!\u201d in Dayton, he announced at a press conference that he wanted lawmakers to pass a \u201cred flag law,\u201d which allows courts to take guns from people who are deemed dangerous. \u201cSome in the crowd were angry,\u201d DeWine said of those who confronted him in Dayton. \u201cThey should be angry.\u201d He added, \u201cThey chanted \u2018Do something,\u2019 and they are absolutely right.\u201d The governor is also asking the legislature to consider enacting background checks for all gun sales, except for those between family members. Foreign countries are warning their citizens about travel to the US after this weekend\u2019s pair of shootings that killed 31 people, the LA Times reports. Uruguay\u2019s Foreign Ministry issued a statement warning about \u201cgrowing indiscriminate violence\u201d in the US, urging Uruguayans to avoid \u201ctheme parks, shopping centers, festivals, religious events, gastronomic fairs and any kind of cultural or sporting events.\u201d The Japanese Consul in Detroit advised Japanese nationals to \u201cbe aware of the potential for gunfire incidents everywhere in the United States,\u201d describing the country as \u201ca gun society.\u201d Trump plans to visit El Paso tomorrow as it mourns the loss of 22 members of its community, but the president\u2019s reelection campaign still owes the city more than $500,000. Trump held a February rally at an El Paso arena, and according to the Center for Public Integrity, the campaign has an unpaid balance to the city of $569,204. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous and unconscionable. The city of El Paso is an economically challenged community,\u201d said El Paso County Commissioner Dave Stout, who \u201cadamantly\u201d opposes Trump visiting. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be throwing salt into the wound -- a very, very deep wound,\u201d Stout said. \u201cAnd this community needs healing, not Donald Trump.\u201d The New York Times was forced to change the front-page headline of today\u2019s paper amid intense backlash over how it portrayed Trump\u2019s statement on the shootings. The original headline read: \u201cTRUMP URGES UNITY VS. RACISM.\u201d Many Twitter commentators complained that the wording fed Trump\u2019s claim that those who called out his anti-immigrant rhetoric in the wake of the El Paso shooting were playing politics. The headline first gained widespread attention when it was tweeted out by FiveThirtyEight\u2019s Nate Silver: As Silver\u2019s tweet was being reshared thousands of times, the Times changed the headline for the second print edition to, \u201cASSAILING HATE BUT NOT GUNS.\u201d A Times spokesperson acknowledged to the Washington Post, \u201cThe headline was bad and has been changed for the second edition.\u201d But it seems the damage had already been done. Many prominent Democrats, including several presidential candidates, took to Twitter to accuse the Times of distorting Trump\u2019s teleprompter address. And some people even threatened to cancel their subscriptions. From presidential candidate Kirsten Gillibrand: From Cory Booker: Beto O\u2019Rourke, who used to represent part of El Paso in the House, offered a one-word response: New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, who is also running for president, mocked the Times using a tagline from its ads: And Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez argued that the botched headline represented how institutions often aid white supremacy: Good morning, live blog readers! Donald Trump has already been tweeting for a couple of hours already, and he is offering the American people this important message: don\u2019t blame him. He also cited a \u201cFox &amp; Friends\u201d segment to specifically call out Barack Obama, who issued a statement urging Americans to \u201csoundly reject language coming out of the mouths of any of our leaders that feeds a climate of fear and hatred or normalizes racist sentiments.\u201d In his own robotic statement yesterday addressing the shootings in El Paso and Dayton, Trump called on the nation to \u201ccondemn racism, bigotry and white supremacy.\u201d But he has clearly not taken kindly to the argument made by many that his own anti-immigrant rhetoric has intensified racist sentiments in the country. (The El Paso suspect posted an anti-immigrant screed online before killing 22 at a Walmart.) Trump has done this sort of walk-back on condemning racism before. Just last month, he initially said he was \u201cunhappy\u201d when some attendees of his North Carolina rally broke out in a racist \u201csend her back\u201d chant about Representative Ilhan Omar. But he later referred to attendees of the rally as \u201cincredible patriots.\u201d When it comes to racism in America, it seems Trump is most bothered by any insinuation that the rhetoric or, in this week\u2019s case, fatal violence is any reflection upon him. Here are a few other things the blog is keeping its eye on: Trump has no events on his public schedule today, so expect the tweeting to continue. Mike Pence is meeting with the British foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, at 4:30 p.m. EDT. More than a dozen national groups are holding a rally in Washington\u2019s Lafayette Park, just in front of the White House, to demand action on gun violence at 12 p.m. EDT. That\u2019s all still coming up, so stay tuned.",

The federal government has spent years developing a national alcohol strategy to address the harm of excessive alcohol consumption, which remains one of the major contributors to the burden of illness and death. Experts, health campaigners and the World Health Organisation have consistently urged governments to exclude the alcohol industry from any role in developing such policies. But, after releasing an initial draft for public consultation in 2017, the government approached a range of stakeholders in 2018, including the alcohol industry. The newly revised draft, leaked to the ABC last month, watered the strategy down to such an extent that the ACT government \u2013 fearing meddling from the alcohol industry \u2013 has declined to endorse it. The Foundation for Alcohol Research and Education, a health advocacy group, has now analysed the differences between the drafts and allege they have \u201calcohol industry fingerprints all over\u201d them. Language in the draft has been changed to allow for industry involvement in the reform process, for example.

The University of Newcastle researcher Tony Brown developed a tool to test whether industry had achieved legislative capture. He found, in the NSW case, the alcohol industry exerted \u201covert power\u201d through its ability to make \u201clarge political donations and call in favours, despite the existence of political donation laws in NSW prohibiting the same\u201d. \u201cIts kinetic power lies in its latent capacity to also influence and mobilise its many patrons (voters) and related third-party vocal interest groups to oppose any proposed laws that may inhibit their drinking patterns \u2013 a crucial factor in industry profits,\u201d the study found.
