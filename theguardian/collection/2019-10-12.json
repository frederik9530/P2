Do not read on unless you have watched season seven, episodes one and two. </em></p> <p>Bonsoir Spiral heads, and welcome back to the Paris they won\u2019t show you in the brochures. Dysfunctional cops blunder their way to justice against a grimy backdrop of drugs, sex trafficking and prosecutorial horsetrading and boy don\u2019t we love it? We last saw our heroes 20 months ago and, while only a few months have passed in Spiral world, no one is quite how we left them.</p> <h2><strong>Getting away with murder?</strong></h2> <p>We say a final goodbye tonight to that old grouch Commissioner Herville, shot through the head in a Chinese restaurant in an apparent heist gone wrong. It doesn\u2019t pack the emotional punch of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2015/jan/24/spiral-season-five-episodes-five-and-six-recap-shocking-end-packed-double-bill\">Pierre\u2019s death</a>, but Herville was still one of the gang and his murder is enough to get a still-fragile Laure out of rehabilitation and on the case and a still-angry Gilou to allow her back into their crime family.</p> <p>Clues fall into the crew\u2019s lap quickly enough, but stitching them into a coherent narrative will take time. So far, we know that Herville was set to meet a mystery man at the restaurant and that something undisclosed was worrying him. We know that four youths \u2013 Jimmy, Rayan, Fifi and Karim \u2013 travelled in the Renault Clio spotted at the crime scene.

      "bodyText": "Spoiler alert: this recap is for people watching Spiral on the BBC. Do not read on unless you have watched season seven, episodes one and two. Bonsoir Spiral heads, and welcome back to the Paris they won\u2019t show you in the brochures. Dysfunctional cops blunder their way to justice against a grimy backdrop of drugs, sex trafficking and prosecutorial horsetrading and boy don\u2019t we love it? We last saw our heroes 20 months ago and, while only a few months have passed in Spiral world, no one is quite how we left them. Getting away with murder? We say a final goodbye tonight to that old grouch Commissioner Herville, shot through the head in a Chinese restaurant in an apparent heist gone wrong. It doesn\u2019t pack the emotional punch of Pierre\u2019s death, but Herville was still one of the gang and his murder is enough to get a still-fragile Laure out of rehabilitation and on the case and a still-angry Gilou to allow her back into their crime family. Clues fall into the crew\u2019s lap quickly enough, but stitching them into a coherent narrative will take time. So far, we know that Herville was set to meet a mystery man at the restaurant and that something undisclosed was worrying him. We know that four youths \u2013 Jimmy, Rayan, Fifi and Karim \u2013 travelled in the Renault Clio spotted at the crime scene. Four goons in a 4x4 later delivered a life-threatening beatdown to Karim, who remains in an induced coma. With Fefe stonewalling the cops, Team Escoffier don\u2019t have much to go on but they eventually track down Jimmy and Rayan to the home of Rayan\u2019s associate Serge Langlois. A quick poke at the loft hatch and it\u2019s raining Euros. Either one of these dopes took Cash in the Attic too literally or there\u2019s a pile of dirty money that needs accounting for. Gilou We left a bereft Gilou clutching a giant panda bear like a Generation Game contestant as Laure did a bunk from the hospital and their relationship. Losing Laure, Tintin and now Herville in a few months has been bruising for the squad bruiser but he hasn\u2019t used it as an excuse to go off the rails.

As he says, not much unsettles him now. \u201cThere are a lot of proud West Ham people because I am playing for England,\u201d he says. \u201cSometimes I have a little laugh and say: \u2018Euro 2020 \u2013 let\u2019s bring it home\u2019 but Bobby Moore won the World Cup. Over at the academy you notice what a big player he was for England and West Ham. Maybe I could be the next one.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A reminder of events in Georgia earlier: And here\u2019s a chat with man-of-the-moment Joshua King: As for reports that Henrik Larsson is set to take over at Southend United, an email from Helsingborg. \u201cLiving in Sweden, the Southend/Larsson connection is rather big news,\u201d begins Julian Menz. \u201cA staple here is the \u201dr\u00e4kmacka\u201d. An open sandwich with shrimps smothered in mayo, you see where I\u2019m going with this, but will throw in a curve-ball. Henke has form with SE coastal clubs, and I\u2019d be a bit concerned if I were a Roots Hall Shrimper ... \u201d What do those results mean? Well, Italy have secured their place at Euro 2020, while that ice-cool penalty by Joshua King means Norway\u2019s quest to reach the tournament next summer lives on. Spain can no longer secure a clean sweep of qualifying victories, after being denied a seventh successive win in Oslo. King, a vastly underrated player, rolled home his penalty for Norway, who have not lost on home soil for three years. It was a bumpy evening in Rome but Italy are the first host nation of Euro 2020 to qualify for the tournament. After a gloomy period in the wilderness, Italy are very much back with a bang under Roberto Mancini. Italy 2-0 Greece Norway 1-1 Spain Malta 0-4 Sweden Liechtenstein 1-1 Armenia Joshua King beats Kepa Arrizabalaga from the spot. 90 min: Into stoppage-time we go ... 86 min: Insigne almost puts the gloss on a good evening for Italy \u2013 but the Greece goalkeeper Paschalakis makes a shrewd stop at his near post. Meanwhile, Mancini throws on Roma\u2019s Zaniolo in place of Inter\u2019s Barella. 80 min: Spain are soldiering on in Norway, with the Manchester City midfielder Rodri introduced for the closing stages. He replaces Mikel Oyarzabal. That surely confirms their spot at Euro 2020. Federico Bernardeschi fires in from outside the box, with a helping hand from a deflection. And that allows Roberto Mancini to freshen things up, with Andrea Belotti replacing the largely ineffective Immobile. 77 min: Big news in Malta: Michael Mifsud is on for his 142nd cap. 74 min: Greece spurn a golden opportunity to level things up! Greece work the ball back to Anastasios Bakasetas, who is unmarked inside the box. But the striker slices his volley at goal and it ends up looping into the grateful arms of Gianluigi Donnarumma. Italy get away with one. Again. 72 min: Talking of Sweden ... the Southend Echo are reporting that the former Celtic striker Henrik Larsson is set to take charge of Southend United, with ex-Liverpool forward Dirk Kuyt as his assistant manager. Watch this space. Seb Larsson with his second dispatch from 12 yards puts Sweden out of sight. They might as well put their feet up. Liechtenstein, meanwhile, have equalised at home to Armenia. 68 min: Santi Cazorla, just on for Dani Ceballos, tries his luck from the angle but the Norway goalkeeper Rune Jarstein is equal to it. Spain are hunting down a second goal ... 67 min: Fabi\u00e1n Ruiz rattles the crossbar for Spain! It was a delicious left-footed effort from outside the box. The Napoli midfielder is having some year, having helped his country to the Euro Under-21 glory in Italy this summer; his left boot is majestic. Sweden are cruising to three vital points in Group F. The Chelsea midfielder sends Paschalakis the wrong way. 62 min: Penalty for Italy! ... Insigne takes aim and Andreas Bouchalakis moves his left arm down to block a goalbound strike. He\u2019s booked for his efforts. 60 min: Koulouris hits the side netting! Limnios drills a wonderful inviting ball across the six-yard box but another golden opportunity goes gaping. He should have buried it. Greece are giving Italy are real run for their money. In Oslo, surprise, surprise: Sergio Busquets has been booked. Sebastian Larsson doubles Sweden\u2019s lead from the penalty spot. 55 min: This is Bonucci\u2019s 92nd Italy cap, overtaking Alessandro Del Piero in 10th position in the all-time appearances ranking. Top, top player. But it is up the other end where Italy are having joy now, with Paschalakis alert to make a decent save from a Ciro Immobile header. Both teams are digging their heels in. 53 min: Spain, tails up, are enjoying themselves now. Down in Rome Italy are making of meal of things. They fail to break through the middle and Greece buy a foul out of Bonucci, who is lured upfield and into the challenge. Exquisite strike after the hosts fail to clear their lines. Norway made a mess of clearing a Bernat cross from the left and Sa\u00fal takes a neat touch on his left foot to steady himself before thrashing the ball at goal with his right. Beautiful, dipping effort. 46 min: Here we go, then! We\u2019re back under way in Rome, Oslo, Liechtenstein and Malta. We have been starved of goals, so maybe there will be a second-half slew. Essential half-time reading: The Wales captain Gareth Bale has said he would love to \u201cget one over\u201d on his Croatia counterpart and Real Madrid teammate Luka Modric at the fourth time of asking when the pair duel on Sunday. Bale has described the meeting in Cardiff as a humongous match with Ryan Giggs\u2019s side fourth in Group E, six points behind leaders Croatia with three Euro 2020 qualifiers to play. Italy 0-0 Greece Liechtenstein 0-1 Armenia Malta 0-1 Sweden Norway 0-0 Spain 45 min: Kristoffer Ajer nods a free header wide for Norway! 44 min: Spain scramble the ball to safety after Norway recycle a corner! Hovland is clattered in the box but Michael Oliver is having none of it and, as Norway play on, they almost work the ball goalwards before Albiol hacks clear. First-half stoppage-time looms around the grounds. There will be at least two minutes in Oslo. 41 min: In Rome Spinazzola speeds past his man, gets towards the byline and crosses low for Ciro Immobile ... but Greece stand firm. That was the first real sniff of goal for the Italy frontman but the opposition made life difficult, with Chatzidiakos quick on the scene to get a smart block in and extinguish the danger. 38 min: Big chance drops for Norway and Omar Elabdellaoui! The Norway full-back finds himself in an unfamiliar position, a few yards out after latching on to a dinked pass but the Olympiakos defender dallies on it and, before he makes up his mind as to what to do with it, the opportunity has been and gone. King was crying out for it in the centre but Spain survive. They get away with one. 34 min: Armenia lead Liechtenstein in Group J! The goal was scored by Tigran Barseghyan, a free agent, according to Wikipedia. That strike will surely get the wheels in motion. And if things stay that way, Armenia will pile the pressure on Finland, who were battered by Bosnia earlier on. An unbeaten Italy side, who are in action against Greece as we speak, remain very much top of that group. 30 min: Stefan Johansen is late on Jesus Navas, yet the Fulham midfielder is quick to tell Michael Oliver that the unorthodox Spain full-back was trying to deceive the referee. Still, Johansen gets away with a ticking off and that\u2019s that. Moments earlier, Norway were forced into a change with Hovland replacing Nordtveit. 27 min: A quick referee-watch: in Oslo, Northumberland\u2019s finest, Michael Oliver, is the man in the middle. On a serious note, Oliver is arguably the best referee in the Premier League these days, isn\u2019t he? Any other contenders? 23 min: Joshua King has a tame header saved by Kepa! Spain go up the other end but Sa\u00fal \u00d1\u00edguez\u2019s daisy-cutter doesn\u2019t truly trouble the Norway back line. In Rome, Italy are plugging away and earn another free-kick. Bonucci tries to flick the ball on but no one else gambles. Italy are yet to test the Greece goalkeeper Paschalakis on only his second international appearance. 20 min: \u201cHave Malta ever won a European qualifier!?\u201d asks Joey R. Sweden, who unveiled a statue of king Zlatan in Malmo this week, may well by cruising but Malta are no mugs. They have, indeed, won a qualifier, and beat the Faroe Islands as recently as March, though they will do well to go savour victory tonight. The Swedes are enjoying themselves at the Ta\u2019Qali stadium, where Danielsson\u2019s goal remains the difference. And, believe it or not, former Coventry City striker Michael Mifsud, now 38, is again on the bench for Malta. These days Mifsud is playing for Maltese outfit Birkirkara. 16 min: Spain go close! Jesus Navas does brilliantly, raiding down the right after latching on to a devilishly cute flick by Fabian Ruiz \u2013 a standout player at the Under-21 Euros in the summer \u2013 but Rodrigo is too slow to react and no one in a white shirt is there to prod home. Nordtveit takes a whack on the back of that attack but he seems OK to soldier on. Encouraging stuff for the visitors nonetheless. Can Norway weather the storm? 12 min: Back in Rome, Donnarumma is forced into a fine save! He repels a smart effort by Limnios after D\u2019Ambrosio\u2019s error. That goal for Sweden primes them for second in Group F, behind leaders Spain, who are in action in Norway. The defender Marcus Danielson puts the visitors ahead. 9 min: Federico Chiesa is busy making a nuisance of himself for Italy, but Stafylidis is alert to the danger. D\u2019Ambrosio is limping after picking up an impact injury after colliding with Koulouris but he looks OK to carry on. \u201cThe Italians are successfully rebuilding and I believe they will have a comfortable win tonight,\u201d emails James. Elsewhere, standby for news of a goal ... 6 min: \u201cThe Italians are looking good and my tip to win the Euros next year,\u201d emails James Roe. They are quietly going about their business against Greece, with Jorginho and co knocking the ball around for fun. At the back, Leonardo Bonucci, the only Juventus player in the starting XI, is fast closing in on 100 caps. 2 min: Rune Jarstein is called into action early on in Oslo, with Mikel Oyarzabal flashing a ball across goal after probing by Rodrigo. Encouraging stuff in Rome, too, where Roberto Mancini is stood, arms folded, looking very relaxed. And we\u2019re off around the grounds. \u201cThat stadium in the picture looks a bit run down,\u201d emails Simon McMahon. \u201cMaybe if it was rebranded as, say, the Emirates Colosseum, with an official beer partner and all that, I\u2019m sure attendances might increase?\u201d Don\u2019t go giving anyone any ideas. On a serious note, keep the emails flooding in. \u201cWould you be able to tell me if the Denmark victory over Switzerland is good or bad for Ireland?\u201d emails J.R. \u201cI\u2019m too lazy to try to figure it out for myself.\u201d Well, here are a few permutations: if Switzerland and Ireland draw in Geneva on Tuesday, Denmark will qualify with a win over Gibraltar. If Ireland win in Switzerland, they have qualified and Switzerland will be sent packing. If Switzerland beat Ireland, they then qualify if they beat Georgia and Gibraltar. \u201cIt might all hinge on the Denmark game at home who knows but let\u2019s take try and take care of Switzerland first,\u201d said Mick McCarthy earlier. Clear as mud, right? Group J Bosnia 4-1 Finland Group D Denmark 1-0 Switzerland Georgia 0-0 Republic of Ireland Group F Faroe Islands 0-3 Romania Joshua King is only eight goals away from Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s goalscoring tally of 23 goals in a Norway shirt. The Bournemouth striker has been in fine form this season and is a man Spain will need to keep in check this evening.

      "bodyText": "The UK government has been accused of acting like \u201ca banana republic\u201d after suppressing charges against the British group of Isis militants known as \u201cthe Beatles\u201d out of fears that trying them at home could set a precedent for mass jihadist repatriations. Prosecutors charged one member of the group, Alexanda Kotey, with multiple counts of murder in 2016 but the Home Office made no attempt to bring him home to face justice because, sources say, then home secretary Theresa May felt it was politically problematic. Kotey was a member of the so-called \u201cIsis Beatles\u201d gang accused of beheading seven westerners, and last Thursday was transferred from Kurdish detention in Syria to US military custody in Iraq ahead of a potential US trial where he could face the death penalty. Court documents reveal that the 35-year-old was charged with five counts of murder and eight counts of hostage-taking in February 2016 by the Crown Prosecution Service and warrants were issued for his arrest. However, UK ministers continued to publicly claim it had no evidence against the Londoner, insisting the best chance of prosecution was to send him to the US, where he is now expected to be tried in Virginia, a state which has the death penalty. Ken Macdonald QC, a former UK director of public prosecutions, said: \u201cThis abject behaviour, driven entirely by party politics, dumped what was clearly our problem onto the rest of the world.\u201d He added: \u201cIt calls into question Britain\u2019s status as a dignified sovereign state capable of regulating the conduct of its own citizens, and it reduces us to the level of a banana republic lacking any faith in the power of our own institutions of justice.\u201d A legal source with knowledge of the case added: \u201cThe Home Office abdicated a prosecution they could have easily got for political gain, but one that was disingenuous to the families of the British victims who wanted them to face justice in the UK. It had real repercussions for them.\u201d The source also claimed that British families of those murdered by \u201cthe Beatles\u201d were misled by UK government officials. \u201cThey were told that \u2018if these men are not sent to the US, we won\u2019t be able to prosecute them\u2019. They actually said this to victims in the case, which is really shocking.\u201d Despite prosecutors concluding they had a realistic prospect of convicting Kotey, then security minister Ben Wallace told parliament in July 2018 that the UK did not have evidence to try him in the UK, and a US trial was the only option. In the same month, a leaked letter from former home secretary Sajid Javid to Jeff Sessions, the US attorney general, revealed that the UK was sending Kotey to the US and had not demanded \u201cassurances\u201d that he would be spared the death penalty.Justifying the decision, Javid said that a \u201csuccessful federal prosecution in the US is more likely to be possible\u201d. Transcripts from the supreme court also reveal that UK prosecutors believe they could try another \u201cBeatles\u201d member in Britain. Londoner El Shafee Elsheikh, 30, who was also sent to Iraq last week, could be charged at least with the offence of being a member of a proscribed organisation. The \u201cDPP [the director of public prosecutions] now concedes that there may be sufficient evidence to charge and prosecute him [Elsheikh] here\u201d, states a document. Two years after the CPS issued arrest warrants for Kotey in 2016, the Home Office withdrew his and Elsheikh\u2019s British citizenship, leaving them stateless and at risk of \u201crendition and torture\u201d. Macdonald, a crossbench peer, said that stripping Kotey of his citizenship appeared to be an attempt by the government \u201cto duck responsibility for bringing this Briton to justice.\u201d He called for Kotey to be repatriated urgently from US custody to the UK. \u201cThe government owes it to the victims, and to their families and friends, to put political cowardice to one side, to live up to its constitutional responsibilities, and to bring this man to justice before an English jury,\u201d said Macdonald. The details have emerged as the high court later this month considers an application for judicial review by the mother of ElSheikh to try and force the government to try him in the UK. Maha Elgizouli is taking action against the CPS after her lawyers claimed there was sufficient evidence to successfully prosecute her son in Britain, rather than allow him to be taken to the US. The Home Office has said its aim is for Kotey and Elsheikh to \u201cface justice in the most appropriate jurisdiction, which maximises the chance of a successful prosecution\u201d and stated the UK would work \u201cextremely closely with the US government and others to achieve this aim\u201d. Yesterday, a Home Office spokesperson added: \u201cOur priority is to deliver justice for the victims\u2019 families and for the individuals suspected of these sickening crimes to face prosecution as quickly as possible.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Here is Aaron Bowers\u2019 report from Old Trafford. Thanks for joining me. Ian Watson says the best team won on the night, which is certainly accurate. He says wants to keep some of the extra fans that turned up for the Grand Final to help take Salford forward in the future. Skipper Roby says the win is what outgoing coach Justin Holbrook \u201cdeserves\u201d. He then comes in for a chat, which is greeted with a huge cheers from the fans. Holbrook says he was not nervous throughout the game thanks to his full confidence in the team and players. \u201cSometimes dreams don\u2019t come true,\u201d says Jackson Hastings, adding that St Helens are \u201ctoo good\u201d. Luke Thompson is awarded the Man of the Match award and trots out a few cliches. In the background McCarthy-Scarsbrook runs the length of the pitch and dives to the ground. Thompson does add that this is the Saints\u2019 best team he\u2019s played in. Salford\u2019s players collapse to the ground, while St Helens run around and hug each other. The Red Devils look disappointed but they can really be proud of their season as a whole and there\u2019s no shame in losing to this Saints team. Was it ever in doubt? There was no fairytale for Salford as St Helens dominated from start to finish apart from a 10-minute period prior to half-time. Salford just could not cope with the quality in the end. Makinson wanted some adulation, so whacks a drop goal from distance to add an extra point. 78 mins: This is all done and dusted, to be honest. Everyone is just going through motions. 76 mins: Evalds evades a number of Saints players and picks up some good distance but it comes to nothings as the final tackle ends with another Coote catch. 74 mins: Inu sends a kick far too long, which Coote claims without fuss in his goal area. 72 mins: Lots of red and white flags are waving as St Helens move closer and closer to victory. Salford try a short kick in an attempt to claim possession. Thompson goes down with cramp - he is yet to go off, so might be time to do so. The referee once again angers the Salford fans as someone is adjudged offside, gifting a penalty to St Helens. Coote lines it up and sends it over. 69 mins: Walmsley almost bundles his way through four Salford players but he is just held up about five yards from the line. Jones offloads superbly to Evalds, allowing Salford to make a few more yards but then St Helens claim it after a crossfield kick on the final tackle. 67 mins: This game is getting away from Salford, despite their best efforts. They\u2019ll have some frustrations with the referee, too. 65 mins: Lussick whacks a stunning 40:20 kick to earn some territory. Salford move things quickly and get close to the line but then Dudson knocks. He is held up and then Smith pulls him down as he tries to play the ball. The referee has had a very bad second half, making decisions generally in St Helens\u2019 favour. 63 mins: St Helens are14 points up now and look like adding a few more. Evalds takes another great catch for Salford but it\u2019s just further proof how often they\u2019ve been stuck in their own 22. Bibby fails to play the ball correctly and the referee calls him out. Saints get the scrum on the 22, then Dudson shows his frustration with a high tackle on Thompson, allowing Coote to knock one from under the sticks. 58 mins: Salford go through a full set of six and barely earn any yards until Hastings whacks the ball downfield for Coote to claim. Makinson takes a run for the first time since suffering his injury and looks sore after the hit. Mossop then smashes into Taia, who comes out of it badly. 56 mins: A big hit from Naigama on Inu results in the Salford man dropping the ball. Naigama does not seem to actually try to tackle Inu and instead hits him with the shoulder, resulting in a knock-on. Another poor decision from the referee. 54 mins: Salford get into a dangerous position, Hastings tries to dummy a couple of defenders but they read it and take him down. Lussick is the next to have a go but he\u2019s held up before the line. A Hastings kick is devoured by Coote and St Helens start again. 52 mins: Can Salford bounce back from this? The key might be to attack Makinson who looks like he is functioning with one arm but they have no suitable replacements, so they really want him to stay on. On the final tackle, Percival darts inside, clips the ball through the defence with his boot, chases it down and dives onto it. The referee checks the grounding but it\u2019s fine. It was a great bit of creativity from Percival. Coote whacks over the conversion. 48 mins: We definitely have a serious final on our hands now. Fages sends a forward pass and it\u2019s spotted for a penalty to Salford before things could get dangerous. 46 mins: Inu gets back into the game by collecting Coote\u2019s kick. Evalds almost breaks through the defence is just about stopped before he can get away and head for the line. 44 mins: The clock is off after Makinson is forced to the ground but comes up holding his shoulder and looks in pain. He gets up to carry on but seems uncomfortable. Ashworth is ruled offside after a big chase, allowing Salford to gain some territory. Their set of six sees Inu get a whack in the head from Ashworth (that man again). Seems like a bit of a needless headbutt from Ashworth who is being very aggressive out there. Calm down, mate. Inu looks quite groggy, too. 42 mins: Sio collects the long kick to end a set of six and Salford kickstart their half from deep. There\u2019s a bit of thrust to get Salford up to the halfway line, then a high kick is taken by Makinson to end it. Here we go again! Salford are back out first, as they are so keen to show what they can do. St Helens follow them. Should be cracking. Here is the Salford try ... After dominating the first 25 minutes of so, St Helens are now in a contest, that\u2019s for sure. It looked like Saints would be out of sight by the break thanks to two tries but then Salford fought back and looked like the better side for the final quarter of the half. If Salford can keep this up, then it should be a fascinating second half. 38 mins: St Helens power up to the halfway line but Evalds again retrieves the kick. 36 mins: Evalds claims a good catch from an up and under and sets up Salford for a set of six. Salford try to move the ball along the line too quickly and a pass is misplaced but no St Helens player can get his hands on it. Hastings with a good kick into the corner relieves pressure and gives Saints a scrum on their own 10 yard line. 34 mins: I thought Salford were almost out of this game already but they\u2019ve made the most of some quickly generated momentum. Salford\u2019s players and fans have certainly stepped it up a notch. Hastings is at the heart of everything positive for Salford and he shows his importance again with some good hands out wide, putting the ball into the hands of Bibby, allowing him to drop a shoulder and power through to get over the line. Inu whacks the ball through the posts from a tricky position. 30 mins: Hastings dives on a loose ball after Fages sends it back to no one. Salford have enjoyed a couple of good minutes and need to make the most of the slight improvement. Hastings cuts through the defence and the ball ends up out wide with Sio but he\u2019s held up, not that it matters as the referee decrees Salford merit another set of six. 28 mins: Another kick goes up from Saints, which Inu drops but luckily for Salford it actually goes backwards. Salford finally make some yards as Hastings is taken down. Lolohea goes over the line for Salford after ducking and diving around the try line and it looks like they would be getting their first points but Tomkins is done for obstruction and Lolohea\u2019s effort is chalked off. Saints go on the blindside from the scrum. Roby moves quickly and sends it inside to Taia who eases over for the second try, which is confirmed after the video referee looks at it. Lovely thinking and execution from Roby made the try. Coote sends over the kick. 23 mins: Salford are really just going through the motions here and do not look like causing any problems for St Helens. It\u2019s not much of a contest at the moment, with a second Saints try looking inevitable. Salford need some magic or luck to get back into this at the moment. Coote puts up a kick and Sio tries to take but then drops it near his own line, summing up the day so far for Salford. 21 mins: The final tackle ends when Naigama is held up about 10 yards from goal. Salford bring on Walker as they look to change things up. They are yet to find any gaps in the St Helens defence. Grace takes the ball upfield for St Helens, breaking away, looking like he won\u2019t be caught but it clip and goes down before he can sense the try line. 19 mins: Salford get things going once again and they will need to find something a bit different going forward. To make things they are penalised for offside. They seem a touch rattled and they really need to keep their cool on tonight of all nights. Walmsley easily breaks through a tackle and Salford fail to stop him. Peyroux is another who almost makes it through then a kick rebounds off a Salford man and it\u2019s another set of six! Walmsley spots a gap in the defence and passes the ball to Knowles who runs into the space and drops over the line just to the left of the posts. The try had been coming. Coote knocks over the conversion too. 14 mins: Salford move over the halfway line, which is a novel experience for them. Hastings whacks an up and under, which Coote predicts and takes it with ease. Their set of six ends with a great drilled kick from Coote to the try line, forcing Salford to start from deep once again. 12 mins: Makinson makes a dart after a scrum and the second tackle is moved quickly out wide where Coote takes control of it, beats a man but then tries to offload it and sends the ball straight out of play. A strange decision but a sign of how much Saints want to get on the scoreboard quickly. 10 mins: Coote puts up a kick on the final tackle, Evalds takes the ball in the air and is taken out while off the ground by Percival. Salford will be pleased with the extra yardage they earn from that. 8 mins: Salford are really having to grind to get up into St Helens territory and haven\u2019t got near the opposition line yet. They\u2019ve had a few sets of six now and have had to kick from around the halfway line every time, allowing St Helens to run it out. 6 mins: St Helens are making most of the running here and are progressing down the pitch with relative ease. Their set ends when Coote is taken down while trying to find a gap on the final tackle. 4 mins: Both teams certainly look up for this and are determined to take down their nearest opponent. Salford are penalise for a flop and St Helens get to crank it up for another set of six. Walmsley almost crashes through the defence but is just stopped short. There is a kick through, which bounces around but is eventually snaffled by a Salford player before things get more dangerous. 2 mins: An early knock-on sees the ball turned over by Mossop to St Helens. Saints look to take advantage and quickly push Salford onto their own goal-line. Fages tries to slip through on the final tackle but is taken down by Salford. Lets get ready to rumble! Richard Bridges is a Shed Seven fan, he says: \u201cHull KR fan watching in Poland (as you do) - loved seeing Shed Seven - looked as though Alan the drummer might have been wearing a York City Knights shirt too. Yorkshire\u2019s finest!\u201d The players are out of the pitch, their emergence greeted with fireworks and a wall of noise. Should be a cracking atmosphere. We\u2019re getting closer to some actual rugby now as the ubiquitous Laura Wright belts out Jerusalem. Update: Shed Seven are still going. Live music at a sporting event is never a good thing, is it? What we have at Old Trafford is Shed Seven doing a weird advert for their upcoming tour. Special shirts for a special occasion. Sky reminding us of Ben Flower being an idiot in the final against St Helens in 2014 is what we need in this build up. Adrian Morley is desperate for Salford to win and believes they can do it, which is nice. Danny McGuire points out that St Helens are a lot better, so does Phil Clarke. Leeds Rhinos are not at Old Trafford today but their women\u2019s team were victorious in the women\u2019s Grand Final yesterday when they defeated Castleford. They were behind at half-time but ended up winning 20-12. A very smoky arrival for the players #NoPyroNoParty Jackson Hastings enjoying his Man of Steel award ... Misfits ... I think I have been brought in for this historic occasion due to my lengthy links with rugby league. When I was at school I played the sport and was called up to play for Salford schoolboys. I went to one training session where everyone was twice my size, so I decided it wasn\u2019t for me as I was never going to make it as a professional and I liked having my bones intact. St Helens: Coote, Makinson, Naiqama, Percival, Grace, Fages, Lomax, Walmsley, Roby, Thompson, Taia, Peyroux, Knowles Subs: McCarthy-Scarsbrook, Amor, Ashworth, Smith Salford: Evalds, Sio, Welham, Bibby, Inu, Lolohea, Hastings, Mossop, Tomkins, Dudson, Jones, Griffin, McCarthy Subs: Lussick, Flanagan, Walker, Burke Here is Aaron Bower on ruining fairytales ... Good afternoon! We have reached the finale. For the first time in a long time there is a chance of a surprise winner in the form of Salford who have defied plenty of odds with their rag-tag bunch to make it to Old Trafford. They performed some magic to put together a side to bring them to this unknown point. Jackson Hastings is the man at the heart of it and rightly won the Man of Steel but leading his side to victory at Old Trafford would surpass all that. St Helens have been here and won it, so will not be fazed by the occasion and will have no qualms about being party poopers. They will also be aiming to pack Justin Holbrook off with another trophy in his last game as St Helens coach. It should be a lively encounter.",

I am always amused by their delight at coming across a vegetable they have never experienced before.</p> <p>Celtuce could\u2019ve been dreamed up by Dr Seuss.

The tops are long and luscious, like you have a cos lettuce on top of a lollipop stem. If it didn\u2019t taste so darn good, I would dismiss it completely.</p> <p>Many Chinese people have grown up eating celtuce. But even then, it is an uncommon menu item in Australian Chinese restaurants. I\u2019m not quite sure why, because it ticks all the boxes. <em>Lactuca sativa var</em>. <em>augustana</em> is an heirloom cultivar of lettuce, and sometimes referred to as asparagus lettuce. Celtuce is thought to have originated in the Mediterranean, before migrating east to China with trade.</p> <p>In Chinese, the stem and leaves are referred by two separate names: <em>wosun </em>and<em> y\u00f3um\u00e0ic\u00e0i.</em> Used in completely different applications, often the stems are stir-fried quickly and the leaves braised in a broth. I dare say it\u2019s one of the most elegant vegetables going.</p> <p>Over the past few years, I have seen it become more widely available in Asian grocers. If you ever happen to come across celtuce anywhere, I highly recommend you grab a bunch. Be quick, because chef Luke Powell of Bella Brutta and LP\u2019s in Sydney might come along to snatch up the lot! Though he is known for his barbecue and pizza, his vegetable sides are always the stars in my eyes. One of my all-time favourite salads of his is composed of celtuce and apple, cubed and thoughtfully paired with chervil and a soft boiled egg, which sits snugly over sunflower \u201cbutter\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9f087ee19be21f1bde03b80e5558b83435345f77\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f087ee19be21f1bde03b80e5558b83435345f77/0_0_640_640/500.jpg\" alt=\"Luke Powell\u2019s cubed celtuce and apple salad with chervil and a soft boiled egg.\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Luke Powell\u2019s cubed celtuce and apple salad with chervil and a soft boiled egg.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Luke Powell</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yes, it tastes as deliciously toothsome as it sounds.

Using a mandoline for this job is highly recommended. Chop up the leaves into a large mixing bowl.<br><strong>2 large handfuls of celery leaves</strong> \u2013 which I\u2019m sure you didn\u2019t throw out when you used that bunch of celery. Always pick off the leaves, give them a good wash, then store them wrapped up in some damp paper towels or wax wrapper in the crisper part of your refrigerator, for moments like this when you need salad greens and you don\u2019t have any.<br><strong>1 large or 2 small stone fruits</strong> \u2013 Or however many you want. I recommend early nectarines or peaches, which will contrast nicely with the crunchiness of the celtuce. Slice them up into sixths and then equatorially again, so you end up with 12 pieces per fruit. You want the fruit to make a presence with every mouthful, otherwise your fellow salad eaters will think you\u2019re stingy with the fruit, and no one wants to be seen as stingy.<br><strong>1 handful of organic walnuts </strong>\u2013 Toasted in the oven low for seven mins on 140\u00b0C, until a lovely brown. Don\u2019t forget about them \u2013 there\u2019s nothing worse than bitter nuts in your salad, no matter how amazing the other ingredients are.<br><strong>1/2 Meyer lemon, or any citrus </strong>\u2013 preferably organic and unwaxed.<br><strong>1 tbsp of white wine vinegar<br>3 tbps of the best-quality olive oil<br>1 tsp sea salt<br>Freshly ground black pepper</strong></p> <p>Drain the celtuce stems and dry as best as you can before you assemble the salad. Into the bowl that is holding the celtuce leaves, add the celtuce stems, roughly torn celery leaves and stone fruit. Zest the citrus, squeeze in the juice, the vinegar, salt, olive oil and, with a gentleness reserved for cuddling babies, toss the salad with your hands.</p> <p>Sprinkle the walnuts and the black pepper liberally. Eat now or later.</p> <p>Curiously, this salad is perhaps even more delicious as a late-night snack, or a refreshing breakfast \u2013 do what Luke Powell does and put an egg on it!</p>",

      "bodyText": "Few chefs I know are surprised by obscure produce. Admittedly, my broad circle of chef friends are highly competent and extremely curious in the study of their craft. Which means, most are always on the hunt for uncommon produce to put on their plates. I love this about my job: dreaming about the seasons ahead, sourcing and planning which seeds to grow, how and where to grow them at the farm. I get to admire them in their process from seed to harvest, then present them, often in the field, to visiting chefs who ooooh and ahhhhh at their beauty as if they were jewels \u2013 which to me they are. But one vegetable that confounds chef and layman alike is celtuce. It\u2019s a curious looking vegetable. Is it a radish? Cardoon? Peanut plant? Broccoli stem? Celery? Cucumber? Kohlrabi? Lettuce? Jicama? The guesses come thick and fast. I am always amused by their delight at coming across a vegetable they have never experienced before. Celtuce could\u2019ve been dreamed up by Dr Seuss. To me, it\u2019s the supermodel of vegetables. It has such comically uneven proportions, enviously leggy with lush, carefree, blowsy hair much too large for its body. At full maturity the stems are roughly 20cm long, with a diameter that shouldn\u2019t exceed 5cm. The tops are long and luscious, like you have a cos lettuce on top of a lollipop stem. If it didn\u2019t taste so darn good, I would dismiss it completely. Many Chinese people have grown up eating celtuce. But even then, it is an uncommon menu item in Australian Chinese restaurants. I\u2019m not quite sure why, because it ticks all the boxes. Lactuca sativa var. augustana is an heirloom cultivar of lettuce, and sometimes referred to as asparagus lettuce. Celtuce is thought to have originated in the Mediterranean, before migrating east to China with trade. In Chinese, the stem and leaves are referred by two separate names: wosun and y\u00f3um\u00e0ic\u00e0i. Used in completely different applications, often the stems are stir-fried quickly and the leaves braised in a broth. I dare say it\u2019s one of the most elegant vegetables going. Over the past few years, I have seen it become more widely available in Asian grocers. If you ever happen to come across celtuce anywhere, I highly recommend you grab a bunch. Be quick, because chef Luke Powell of Bella Brutta and LP\u2019s in Sydney might come along to snatch up the lot! Though he is known for his barbecue and pizza, his vegetable sides are always the stars in my eyes. One of my all-time favourite salads of his is composed of celtuce and apple, cubed and thoughtfully paired with chervil and a soft boiled egg, which sits snugly over sunflower \u201cbutter\u201d. Yes, it tastes as deliciously toothsome as it sounds. Even if you aren\u2019t quite sure what it is you are eating. Salad of celtuce, early stone fruit, celery leaves and toasted walnuts Serves four as side dish, two for a light dinner, or one if you really like salad 2 stems of celtuce \u2013 Cut off the lettuce\u2019s leafy bit and put aside, peel the outside layer like a carrot, then slice thinly into a bowl of acidulated iced water to stop it from going brown. Using a mandoline for this job is highly recommended. Chop up the leaves into a large mixing bowl. 2 large handfuls of celery leaves \u2013 which I\u2019m sure you didn\u2019t throw out when you used that bunch of celery. Always pick off the leaves, give them a good wash, then store them wrapped up in some damp paper towels or wax wrapper in the crisper part of your refrigerator, for moments like this when you need salad greens and you don\u2019t have any. 1 large or 2 small stone fruits \u2013 Or however many you want. I recommend early nectarines or peaches, which will contrast nicely with the crunchiness of the celtuce. Slice them up into sixths and then equatorially again, so you end up with 12 pieces per fruit. You want the fruit to make a presence with every mouthful, otherwise your fellow salad eaters will think you\u2019re stingy with the fruit, and no one wants to be seen as stingy. 1 handful of organic walnuts \u2013 Toasted in the oven low for seven mins on 140\u00b0C, until a lovely brown. Don\u2019t forget about them \u2013 there\u2019s nothing worse than bitter nuts in your salad, no matter how amazing the other ingredients are. 1/2 Meyer lemon, or any citrus \u2013 preferably organic and unwaxed. 1 tbsp of white wine vinegar 3 tbps of the best-quality olive oil 1 tsp sea salt Freshly ground black pepper Drain the celtuce stems and dry as best as you can before you assemble the salad. Into the bowl that is holding the celtuce leaves, add the celtuce stems, roughly torn celery leaves and stone fruit. Zest the citrus, squeeze in the juice, the vinegar, salt, olive oil and, with a gentleness reserved for cuddling babies, toss the salad with your hands. Sprinkle the walnuts and the black pepper liberally. Eat now or later. Curiously, this salad is perhaps even more delicious as a late-night snack, or a refreshing breakfast \u2013 do what Luke Powell does and put an egg on it!",

In December a Brisbane company was fined $100,000 and its director $20,000 for importing uncooked pig meat which was considered a foot and mouth disease and swine fever risk.

Not ticking that box could save you 15 minutes when progressing through the arrivals hall, says Andrae, but it could also kill millions of pigs. The virus can survive for 36 days without a host and indefinitely in chilled or frozen pork products.

      "bodyText": "Daily Telegraph reporter Mitchell Van Homrigh got dressed up in a bee costume to go \u201cundercover\u201d with Extinction Rebellion but his stunt wasn\u2019t even the most foolish response to the mass protests we saw this week. After making all the bee puns he could think of, Van Homrigh admitted he found the protesters \u201cpassionate and kind and helpful to this blind little bee\u201d. But he finished by reverting to the Joe Hildebrand school of argument about how little the protest would help their cause. \u201cWould these people be better off directing their passions towards developing programs and policy that enact their vision?\u201d he wondered as he removed his bee head. Hildebrand had earlier declared in his weekly news.com.au column that global action for climate change was a waste of time unless the protesters had a solution, as \u201cpassion on its own achieves nothing without a practical plan to back it up\u201d. \u201cRomeo and Juliet were passionate and look what happened to them,\u201d the Studio 10 co-host wrote, before conceding that marching was at least better than doing drugs. But it was Hildebrand\u2019s occasional co-host on Studio 10, Kerri-Anne Kennerley, who stole the headlines with the most offensive response to the protests. Kennerley suggested that protesters be used as speed bumps. Or better still locked up in jail and starved: \u201cPut \u2019em in jail, forget to feed them,\u201d she said. \u201cPersonally, I would leave them all superglued to wherever they do it,\u201d Kennerley said when the panel discussed the disruption to the cities the protesters were causing. \u201cThe guy hanging from the Story Bridge. Why send emergency services? Leave him there until he gets himself out. No emergency services should help them, nobody should do anything and you just put little witches\u2019 hats around them or use them as a speed bump.\u201d Channel 10, which this week narrowly missed censure for an earlier ill-advised comment by Kennerley, later insisted the veteran TV presenter was only joking. \u201cThis morning on Studio 10 Kerri-Anne Kennerley made comments regarding climate protesters that were said in jest,\u201d a spokesman said. \u201cBefore the show concluded, Sarah Harris reiterated the tone of her remarks, affirming that Kerri-Anne wasn\u2019t inciting violence. \u201cKerri-Anne confirmed that she was indeed speaking in hyperbole and her words were clearly a joke.

By this age, each of these women knows exactly who she is. They know what their lives have been about and they can more or less foresee how things will unfold from here. But, over the weekend they spend together, they find all of those certainties completely shattered.</p> <p>The Weekend is a book about growing older, together with others, and the way friendship works between us over a long period of time. It\u2019s about how old friends can hold each other back \u2013 but also how they hold each other <em>up</em>. In the end, I think it\u2019s a celebration of friendship and of change \u2013 even within those friendships we tend to think have been cemented into shape by time. It\u2019s about the rewards available to us if we\u2019re brave enough to allow that cement to crack open, to let these essential renewals take place.</p> <p><strong>What were you reading while you wrote it? </strong>I loved the slightly old-fashioned, middle-class domesticity of Nina Bawden\u2019s The Birds on the Trees, among others. The interiority of Bawden\u2019s and Alice Thomas Ellis\u2019s books especially, and the precision of their observations, were very appealing to me as I wrote this novel.</p> <p><strong>What will you read next? </strong>Christos Tsiolkas\u2019s Damascus. Christos is so adventurous and questing as a writer, taking big risks and exploring new territory all the time, it\u2019s thrilling \u2013 I can\u2019t wait to see what he does with an ancient biblical story.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\".\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <h2><strong>Christian White<br></strong><em><strong>The Wife and the Widow</strong></em><strong><br><sub><sup>Affirm</sup></sub></strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"fe39a587521b09e944e5d17660a78b8718856b34\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fe39a587521b09e944e5d17660a78b8718856b34/0_0_1861_2770/672.jpg\" alt=\"Cover image for The Wife and the Widow by Christian White\" width=\"672\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Tell us about your book. </strong>The Wife and The Widow is a mystery/thriller set in a small island town in the dead of winter, when all the summer tourists have gone and only a handful of locals remain. The story is told from two perspectives: the wife of a man who disappears, and the wife of a man whose husband might be a killer. I was inspired by the question: how well do we know the people we love?</p> <p><strong>What were you reading while you wrote it? </strong>Practice to Deceive by Ann Rule. It\u2019s a true-crime book about the murder of Russel Douglas, a man who was shot to death on Whidbey Island, Washington. I drew inspiration from the book\u2019s spooky island setting.</p> <p><strong>What will you read next? </strong>Silver by Chris Hammer. I\u2019m excited to read it for two reasons. One, this is his follow-up to Scrublands, which I thought was brilliant. Two, Chris Hammer is a charming man and a surprisingly good dancer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\".\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <h2><strong>Elliot Perlman<br></strong><em><strong>Maybe the Horse Will Talk</strong></em><strong><br><sub>Vintage</sub></strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"f6f811126b53b91672b1410c9ab574a482e6300e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f6f811126b53b91672b1410c9ab574a482e6300e/0_0_1807_2764/654.jpg\" alt=\"Cover image for Maybe the Horse Will Talk by Elliot Perlman\" width=\"654\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Tell us about your book. </strong>Stephen Maserov, former teacher, married to fellow teacher Eleanor, has retrained and is now a second-year lawyer working at mega-firm Freely Savage Carter Blanche. Despite toiling around the clock to make budget, he\u2019s in imminent danger of being downsized. And, to make matters worse, Eleanor, sick of single-parenting their two young children thanks to Stephen\u2019s relentless work schedule, has asked him to move out.</p> <p>To keep the job he hates, pay the mortgage and salvage his marriage, he will have to do something strikingly daring, something he never thought himself capable of. But if he\u2019s not careful, it might be the last job he ever has.</p> <p>Maybe the Horse Will Talk<em> </em>is a love story set in a toxic workplace, a reflection on contemporary marriage, and on friendship. It is also an examination of sexual harassment in the workplace and an expos\u00e9 of corporate corruption.</p> <p><strong>What were you reading while you wrote it? </strong>Among the books I read were: Sergei Dovlatov\u2019s The Zone, Pushkin Hills, and The Suitcase; as well as Vladmir Voinovich\u2019s Monumental Propaganda, and The Fur Hat; Nikolai Gogol\u2019s The Overcoat; and I re-read Joseph Heller\u2019s Catch-22, and Something Happened. What they have in common is an uplifting use of dark humour that I used to keep me going and in the appropriate mood.</p> <p><strong>What will you read next?</strong> I think I\u2019m probably one of the few Australians not to have yet read The Arsonist by Chloe Hooper. I\u2019m looking forward to it as soon as my wife gives it back to me.

And next to the body is Martin\u2019s partner, Mandalay Blonde, going into shock and with blood on her hands.</p> <p>Martin doesn\u2019t believe she\u2019s the killer, so he starts searching for the murderer. But the more he digs, the more he uncovers the town\u2019s festering secrets: more death, drug-fuelled orgies, itinerant con artists, a guru, real estate intrigues, shark attacks and a smuggling ring.</p> <p>But for Martin it\u2019s also an emotional journey, forcing him to confront the traumatic events that befell his family more than 30 years ago.</p> <p><strong>What were you reading while you wrote it? </strong>Favourites included: Bodies of Men by Nigel Featherstone; My Sister, the Serial Killer by Oyinkan Braithwaite; Normal People by Sally Rooney; Bruny by Heather Rose; The Rip by Mark Brandi; The Scholar by Dervla McTiernan; and The Lost Man by Jane Harper.</p> <p><strong>What will you read next? </strong>There\u2019s a pile!

A massive bridge is blown up in Tasmania and an international conflict resolution specialist, Astrid Coleman, is brought home to help settle everyone down. Astrid\u2019s brother is the premier of Tasmania and her sister is the leader of the opposition. Their parents are both fragile and there is an election coming in four months.</p> <p>Beyond Tasmania there\u2019s an isolationist US president in his second term, so China is Australia\u2019s newest ally. Astrid hasn\u2019t been home in a long time and the Tasmania she thought was safe in its remoteness is right in the middle of a new world order. Bruny is a fiction set a little ahead and a little to the side of now, but every day that passes it seems to become more relevant.</p> <p><strong>What were you reading while you wrote it? </strong>Fascism: A Warning by Madeleine Albright. This personal and global analysis of fascism in the 20th century and how it is now shaping the 21st was powerful research into the fragility of democracy.</p> <p><strong>What will you read next? </strong>Favel Parrett\u2019s There Was Still Love.

Dead Man Walking chronicles the murky world of one of the nation\u2019s richest property developers, Ron Medich, and his unwavering desire to do away with his nemesis, Michael McGurk. When you have money, and lots of it, you can buy anything \u2013 even murder.</p> <p>In 2009, 10 days before he was murdered, McGurk told me that Medich was going to have him killed. I felt physically ill when he was shot in his Mercedes, in front of his nine-year-old son.

      "bodyText": "Charlotte Wood The Weekend Allen &amp; Unwin Tell us about your book. The Weekend is about three women in their 70s \u2013 Jude, Adele and Wendy \u2013 who come together over a long, hot weekend before Christmas to clean out the beach house of their recently deceased and very beloved friend, Sylvie. By this age, each of these women knows exactly who she is. They know what their lives have been about and they can more or less foresee how things will unfold from here. But, over the weekend they spend together, they find all of those certainties completely shattered. The Weekend is a book about growing older, together with others, and the way friendship works between us over a long period of time. It\u2019s about how old friends can hold each other back \u2013 but also how they hold each other up. In the end, I think it\u2019s a celebration of friendship and of change \u2013 even within those friendships we tend to think have been cemented into shape by time. It\u2019s about the rewards available to us if we\u2019re brave enough to allow that cement to crack open, to let these essential renewals take place. What were you reading while you wrote it? I loved the slightly old-fashioned, middle-class domesticity of Nina Bawden\u2019s The Birds on the Trees, among others. The interiority of Bawden\u2019s and Alice Thomas Ellis\u2019s books especially, and the precision of their observations, were very appealing to me as I wrote this novel. What will you read next? Christos Tsiolkas\u2019s Damascus. Christos is so adventurous and questing as a writer, taking big risks and exploring new territory all the time, it\u2019s thrilling \u2013 I can\u2019t wait to see what he does with an ancient biblical story. Christian White The Wife and the Widow Affirm Tell us about your book. The Wife and The Widow is a mystery/thriller set in a small island town in the dead of winter, when all the summer tourists have gone and only a handful of locals remain. The story is told from two perspectives: the wife of a man who disappears, and the wife of a man whose husband might be a killer. I was inspired by the question: how well do we know the people we love? What were you reading while you wrote it? Practice to Deceive by Ann Rule. It\u2019s a true-crime book about the murder of Russel Douglas, a man who was shot to death on Whidbey Island, Washington. I drew inspiration from the book\u2019s spooky island setting. What will you read next? Silver by Chris Hammer. I\u2019m excited to read it for two reasons. One, this is his follow-up to Scrublands, which I thought was brilliant. Two, Chris Hammer is a charming man and a surprisingly good dancer. Elliot Perlman Maybe the Horse Will Talk Vintage Tell us about your book. Stephen Maserov, former teacher, married to fellow teacher Eleanor, has retrained and is now a second-year lawyer working at mega-firm Freely Savage Carter Blanche. Despite toiling around the clock to make budget, he\u2019s in imminent danger of being downsized. And, to make matters worse, Eleanor, sick of single-parenting their two young children thanks to Stephen\u2019s relentless work schedule, has asked him to move out. To keep the job he hates, pay the mortgage and salvage his marriage, he will have to do something strikingly daring, something he never thought himself capable of. But if he\u2019s not careful, it might be the last job he ever has. Maybe the Horse Will Talk is a love story set in a toxic workplace, a reflection on contemporary marriage, and on friendship. It is also an examination of sexual harassment in the workplace and an expos\u00e9 of corporate corruption. What were you reading while you wrote it? Among the books I read were: Sergei Dovlatov\u2019s The Zone, Pushkin Hills, and The Suitcase; as well as Vladmir Voinovich\u2019s Monumental Propaganda, and The Fur Hat; Nikolai Gogol\u2019s The Overcoat; and I re-read Joseph Heller\u2019s Catch-22, and Something Happened. What they have in common is an uplifting use of dark humour that I used to keep me going and in the appropriate mood. What will you read next? I think I\u2019m probably one of the few Australians not to have yet read The Arsonist by Chloe Hooper. I\u2019m looking forward to it as soon as my wife gives it back to me. She\u2019s raving about its power. Chris Hammer Silver Allen &amp; Unwin Tell us about your book. Silver is Australian crime fiction, a follow-up to Scrublands. It features the same protagonist, Martin Scarsden, although it\u2019s a stand-alone book. Martin arrives in his old hometown, Port Silver, on the far north coast of New South Wales, only to find his best friend from schooldays stabbed to death. And next to the body is Martin\u2019s partner, Mandalay Blonde, going into shock and with blood on her hands. Martin doesn\u2019t believe she\u2019s the killer, so he starts searching for the murderer. But the more he digs, the more he uncovers the town\u2019s festering secrets: more death, drug-fuelled orgies, itinerant con artists, a guru, real estate intrigues, shark attacks and a smuggling ring. But for Martin it\u2019s also an emotional journey, forcing him to confront the traumatic events that befell his family more than 30 years ago. What were you reading while you wrote it? Favourites included: Bodies of Men by Nigel Featherstone; My Sister, the Serial Killer by Oyinkan Braithwaite; Normal People by Sally Rooney; Bruny by Heather Rose; The Rip by Mark Brandi; The Scholar by Dervla McTiernan; and The Lost Man by Jane Harper. What will you read next? There\u2019s a pile! Tiffany Tsao\u2019s Under Your Wings, JP Pomare\u2019s In the Clearing and Christian White\u2019s The Wife and the Widow. Definitely Melissa Lucashenko\u2019s Too Much Lip. Also, Bruce Pascoe\u2019s Dark Emu, even if I\u2019m the last person in Australia to read it! Heather Rose Bruny Allen &amp; Unwin Tell us about your book. Bruny is a political thriller, a satire, a family saga and a love story. A massive bridge is blown up in Tasmania and an international conflict resolution specialist, Astrid Coleman, is brought home to help settle everyone down. Astrid\u2019s brother is the premier of Tasmania and her sister is the leader of the opposition. Their parents are both fragile and there is an election coming in four months. Beyond Tasmania there\u2019s an isolationist US president in his second term, so China is Australia\u2019s newest ally. Astrid hasn\u2019t been home in a long time and the Tasmania she thought was safe in its remoteness is right in the middle of a new world order. Bruny is a fiction set a little ahead and a little to the side of now, but every day that passes it seems to become more relevant. What were you reading while you wrote it? Fascism: A Warning by Madeleine Albright. This personal and global analysis of fascism in the 20th century and how it is now shaping the 21st was powerful research into the fragility of democracy. What will you read next? Favel Parrett\u2019s There Was Still Love. Favel is a writer of particular beauty and craft \u2013 two things I admire very much. Kate McClymont Dead Man Walking Vintage Tell us about your book. Below the veneer of polite society in Sydney there is an undercurrent of shifty deals, corruption and skulduggery of astonishing proportions. Dead Man Walking chronicles the murky world of one of the nation\u2019s richest property developers, Ron Medich, and his unwavering desire to do away with his nemesis, Michael McGurk. When you have money, and lots of it, you can buy anything \u2013 even murder. In 2009, 10 days before he was murdered, McGurk told me that Medich was going to have him killed. I felt physically ill when he was shot in his Mercedes, in front of his nine-year-old son. There were dozens of suspects as McGurk, himself a practised rogue, had lied, cheated and threatened countless business associates. The \u201chit\u201d had all the hallmarks of a professional job \u2013 yet it was anything but. Dead Man Walking is also a chronicle of bungling hitmen, hopeless standover merchants and senseless snitches. The truth is stranger \u2013 and funnier \u2013 than fiction. What were you reading while you wrote it? I was also a judge on the Stella Prize, so I was getting up at the crack of dawn to read dozens of the best work by Australian women writers. It was both daunting and inspiring. What will you read next? One Hundred Years of Dirt by Rick Morton. Morton is a gifted wordsmith whose memoir of surviving grinding poverty has had brilliant reviews. Catherine De Saint Phalle The Sea and Us Transit Lounge Tell us about your book. The Sea and Us is about Harold, an Australian man of Czech origin, who has just returned to Melbourne after living in Seoul for 18 years. Harold feels he\u2019s floating and cannot find his footing. He realises his life has always been at a remove. When he rents a room above Verity\u2019s fish and chip shop, meets Ben and searches for Marylou, things start to change. These unlikely friends also seem to be struggling with similar subterranean preoccupations. A bit like the man who searched for the blue bird all over the world, who upon his return, empty handed and exhausted, opens his window to find the blue bird on his windowsill, Harold has found a home where he least expects it \u2013 right where he started. What were you reading while you wrote it? Nearly all of Milan Kundera; The Museum of Innocence and Silent House by Orhan Pamuk; The Emperor by Ryszard Kapu\u015bci\u0144ski; and I revisited all of Guy de Maupassant. I realise these are all men \u2013 maybe I was subconsciously trying to hear how a sincere masculine voice sounded from within. What will you read next? I have no idea. I\u2019m dying to read Helen Garner\u2019s The Children\u2019s Bach. But strong books are those that decide when they will be read. I\u2019m excited because it\u2019s an event to read Australian writers. They are so deeply rooted in warm irony, doubt and the unexpressed mysticism that is part of this continent. Anna Krien Act of Grace Black Inc Tell us about your book. Act of Grace is \u2013 I hope \u2013 a novel that reflects the times. It spans the journeys of four characters through Australia, Iraq and the USA. Toohey is an Australian soldier returned from the Middle East, carrying the literal wounds of war in his neck in the form of shrapnel.

The CDC\u2019s investigation has so far failed to find any specific chemical causing the deaths and illnesses. The NSW government has subsequently sent a form to health departments across that state asking doctors to report any suspected cases of vaping-associated respiratory disease.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/aug/28/smoke-and-mirrors-experts-divide-over-australias-e-cigarettes-ban\">Smoke and mirrors? Experts divide over Australia's e-cigarettes ban</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Professor Matthew Peters, a respiratory physician, said it was good to see Australian health departments being proactive. While the US outbreak dates back to March, Peters said it\u2019s likely other cases occurring earlier may have been misdiagnosed. In a study published this month <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1913069?query=featured_home\">by the New England Journal of Medicine</a>, a team led by doctors from the Mayo Clinic in the US examined lung tissue biopsies from 17 people suspected to have vaping-associated injuries. All 17 were found to have injuries in their lungs consistent with chemical burns, <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/lung-damage-vaping-chemical-burn-mustard-gas-a9133711.html\">similar to those seen in the lungs of people exposed to mustard gas in the second world war</a>.</p> <p>Doctors in Australia needed to start routinely asking their patients with lung-related issues about whether they were vaping, Peters said.</p> <p>\u201cMost doctors have not been doing this, they might only ask about smoking,\u201d Peters said. \u201cThere are so many reassuring messages out their about e-cigarette use and vaping, such as the statistic that vaping is 95% safer than smoking, and messages that vaping can help people quit smoking. So patients aren\u2019t always telling doctors that they\u2019ve started vaping either, because they don\u2019t see it as a concern. We need to change the questions we are asking as physicians, because the world is different now.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A batch of seized counterfeit product in the US was found to contain a pesticide which when heated turned into cyanide.</p> <footer> <cite>Dr Miranda Ween</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>So far the CDC has interviewed 573 patients affected by the recent spike in respiratory illnesses about their e-cigarette and vaping use in the three months prior to the onset of their symptoms.

      "bodyText": "Australian health departments are on alert for lung injuries caused by vaping after the national health protection agency in the US confirmed 26 deaths and 1,300 injuries have been associated with the use of vaping products and e-cigarettes. As of Friday, figures from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) revealed 80% of those affected by the vaping crisis so far are younger than 35. The CDC\u2019s investigation has so far failed to find any specific chemical causing the deaths and illnesses. The NSW government has subsequently sent a form to health departments across that state asking doctors to report any suspected cases of vaping-associated respiratory disease. Professor Matthew Peters, a respiratory physician, said it was good to see Australian health departments being proactive. While the US outbreak dates back to March, Peters said it\u2019s likely other cases occurring earlier may have been misdiagnosed. In a study published this month by the New England Journal of Medicine, a team led by doctors from the Mayo Clinic in the US examined lung tissue biopsies from 17 people suspected to have vaping-associated injuries. All 17 were found to have injuries in their lungs consistent with chemical burns, similar to those seen in the lungs of people exposed to mustard gas in the second world war. Doctors in Australia needed to start routinely asking their patients with lung-related issues about whether they were vaping, Peters said. \u201cMost doctors have not been doing this, they might only ask about smoking,\u201d Peters said. \u201cThere are so many reassuring messages out their about e-cigarette use and vaping, such as the statistic that vaping is 95% safer than smoking, and messages that vaping can help people quit smoking. So patients aren\u2019t always telling doctors that they\u2019ve started vaping either, because they don\u2019t see it as a concern. We need to change the questions we are asking as physicians, because the world is different now.\u201d So far the CDC has interviewed 573 patients affected by the recent spike in respiratory illnesses about their e-cigarette and vaping use in the three months prior to the onset of their symptoms. Those affected have reported coughing, shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, fatigue, fever, and weight loss. About 76% of those affected reported using products containing THC, one of the chemicals in cannabis. Associate Professor Coral Gartner, a tobacco control researcher with the University of Queensland\u2019s school of public health, said it appeared that a contaminant associated with THC, rather than vaping in and of itself, was the culprit for the deaths and injury in the US. \u201cWhile not everyone has admitted to the use of THC, a number of these have subsequently been found to be lying, which is completely understandable given the potential ramifications for use of illicit substances,\u201d Gartner said. \u201cInvestigators are still not 100% sure on the chemical agent that is responsible for the acute lung damage, but cutting agents containing vitamin E oil have been implicated. \u201cCertainly it is reasonable to assume that illicit THC oil products are sold in Australia. It is less clear if they are likely to contain the chemical agent responsible for the acute lung damage in the USA.\u201d She added that while there may be some lung disease risk associated with standard nicotine vaping products, this was most likely to be different from what was being seen in the US, which she said seemed to be more of an acute poisoning scenario rather than a chronic exposure issue. Dr Miranda Ween, a cancer biologist with Adelaide Medical School, agreed that the US crisis was likely a case of contaminants in a reagent going to many suppliers, or contaminants found in cheap knock-off versions of the big brands. \u201cThis has been possible because of the lack of regulation around quality control in e-liquids to ensure users are safe,\u201d Ween said. \u201cAustralia suffers the same lack of regulations and thus it is entirely possible that we could see a similar situation arise here as well.

Nicnas found while e-cigarette emissions contained contaminants mostly derived from the e-cigarette liquid, some came from the device. Quit Victoria director Dr Sarah White said while this evidence combined with the US cases showed Australian regulators correct to be taking a cautious approach to e-cigarettes, more needed to be done. She agreed with Peters that doctors and researchers needed to be routinely examining people\u2019s vaping history, not just their smoking history. \u201cIf there are vaping-related injuries being seen in Australia, we probably aren\u2019t picking them up,\u201d White said. \u201cThe frightening evidence coming out at the moment absolutely justifies the careful approach being taken by Australia.\u201d While laws around e-cigarettes do vary between states and territories, generally the sale, possession and use of nicotine in the form of an electronic cigarette is illegal.

Then, as now, it was regarded as a form of civic death.</p> <p>Following the brutal experience of Europe in the 1930s and the displacement of the second world war, the practice of denationalisation \u2013 while it remained on statute books \u2013 fell largely into disuse.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/oct/10/scott-morrison-says-he-has-deep-concerns-turkeys-advance-into-syria-could-help-isis\">Scott Morrison says he has 'deep concerns' Turkey's advance into Syria could help Isis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But following 9/11, it has come roaring back into vogue, practised almost exclusively by rich, powerful, western states and <a href=\"https://www.rsc.ox.ac.uk/news/denationalisation-and-discrimination-new-paper-by-matthew-j-gibney\">practised discriminatorily almost always against Muslim citizens</a>.</p> <p>Australia has denationalised 17 citizens since 2015; the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/feb/20/who-has-been-stripped-of-uk-citizenship-before-shamima-begum\">UK has revoked the citizenship of about 120 people since 2016</a>.</p> <p>At almost every occasion, denationalisation is argued by governments as strengthening a country\u2019s citizenship by removing people who, by their beliefs or actions, never truly belonged anyway or are in some way undeserving of the \u201cprivilege\u201d of nationality.</p> <p>In truth, denationalisation weakens the citizenship of all, by making the fundamental right of having a nation to which to belong precarious and contingent on behaviour.</p> <p>There are four fundamental arguments why denationalisation is unjustified:</p> <p>Firstly, it <a href=\"https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/\">risks leaving people stateless</a>.</p> <p>While it is <a href=\"https://www.unhcr.org/en-au/protection/statelessness/3bbb25729/convention-relating-status-stateless-persons.html\">illegal under international law to make someone stateless</a>, the unilateral and arbitrary way by which denationalisation is practised by countries such as the UK and Australia creates situations of effective statelessness.</p> <p>Australia stripped Melbourne-born Isis fighter Neil Prakash of his citizenship despite the fact he had no right to Fijian citizenship \u2013 as claimed by Australia \u2013 a country to which he\u2019d never been and to held no connection.</p> <p>This week, Australia stripped its citizenship from Melbourne woman and \u201cIsis bride\u201d Zehra Duman, claiming she held a Turkish passport. This has not been confirmed by Ankara: she may now, instead, be stateless. Duman has three young children who have also been left at risk of statelessness by Australia\u2019s unilateral action.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The defining characteristics of modern citizenship are that it is secure, and it is egalitarian and equalising</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Similarly, British-born Shamima Begum was stripped of her UK nationality and told she must apply for citizenship of Bangladesh, despite having never been there. Bangladesh, entirely unsurprisingly, refused to recognised her as its own citizen, leaving her in a limbo of effective statelessness.</p> <p>Statelessness is no mere bureaucratic inconvenience, it is deeply debilitating.</p> <p>The right to citizenship is, in Arendtian terms, the \u201cright to have rights\u201d, the fundamental franchise from which all others flow: the right to education, to medical care, to the protection of the law, to the vote.</p> <p>Secondly, denationalisation entrenches global inequality between rich, powerful countries and weak ones. In the 21st century, strong countries \u2013 almost invariably rich, western, liberal democracies \u2013 foist their problematic or politically awkward citizens onto weaker countries, less able to refuse them.</p> <p>On a moral level, countries are responsible for the citizens they create. Prakash is a product of Australia. Begum was born, raised and radicalised in the UK.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/guardian-australia-morning-mail/2014/jun/24/-sp-guardian-australias-morning-mail-subscribe-by-email\">Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Morning mail\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4148\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Guardian Australia's Morning Mail\" data-form-description=\"Get our editors' pick of the biggest headlines every weekday\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>\u201cJust like parents cannot simply turn their back on their children when they do something wrong,\u201d professor of politics and forced migration at Oxford University <a href=\"https://www.rsc.ox.ac.uk/files/files-1/wp75-should-citizenship-be-conditional-2011.pdf\">Matthew Gibney argues</a>, \u201cso a state cannot simply palm off its own failures onto other states\u201d.</p> <p>But now that Prakash, Duman and Begum have become potentially dangerous, or political awkward, their supposed liberal democracies abandon them for other countries to contend with.</p> <p>This too is where the safety argument is most exposed.</p> <p>Discarding a radicalised citizen in a distant country, and outlawing them from returning, might make a liberal democracy ostensibly safer by one.</p> <p>But it makes the world a more dangerous place by foisting a potentially dangerous non-citizen on another country, one almost certainly less able to effectively manage and monitor that person.</p> <p>Abandoning a dangerous citizen like Prakash might make Australia fractionally more safe, but leaving him to an unknown fate is beyond negligent, it is culpable.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Joint/Intelligence_and_Security/Citizenship2019/Submissions\">Australian Security and Intelligence Organisation argues</a> laws that automatically strip citizenship from Australians who engage in terrorism-related conduct increase the risk of terrorism and make pressing charges against criminals harder.</p> <p>\u201cIn some instances, citizenship cessation will curtail the range of threat mitigation capabilities available to Australian authorities,\u201d Asio said in a submission to parliament.</p> <p>\u201cIt may also have unintended or unforeseen adverse security outcomes \u2013 potentially including reducing one manifestation of the terrorist threat while exacerbating another.</p> <p>\u201cThere may be occasions where the better security outcome would be that citizenship is retained, despite a person meeting the legislative criteria for citizenship cessation \u2013 for example, where the Australian Federal Police has criminal charges that could be pursued if the person were to remain an Australian citizen.\u201d</p> <p>Thirdly, denationalisation is invidious. The defining characteristics of modern citizenship are that it is secure, egalitarian and equalising.</p> <p>One citizen\u2019s inalienable right to vote is worth precisely that of any other.</p> <p>Denationalisation creates literal second-class citizens.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/sep/16/duttons-citizenship-stripping-laws-may-increase-risk-of-terrorism-asio-warns\">Dutton\u2019s citizenship-stripping laws may increase risk of terrorism, Asio warns</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Because, under international law, a state cannot render a person stateless, denationalisation creates two levels of citizenship: mono, which is secure and impregnable; and dual, which is precarious and contingent upon some arbitrary and potentially inconsistent government-declared standard of behaviour.</p> <p>People\u2019s dual citizenship \u2013 or even a tenuous possibility of a claim to a second nationality \u2013 is being used by countries to expel them permanently, to cast them as somewhere else\u2019s responsibility.</p> <p>Today it is jihadists who are denationalised, tomorrow climate protestors?</p> <p>Finally, denationalisation is often arbitrary. In most instances where it is practised, such as in the UK and Australia, denationalisation is the stroke of executive pen: it is carried out at the whim of governments, usually without parliamentary or judicial oversight, or any right of the (former) citizen to appeal.</p> <p>This is deeply undemocratic and raises real risk that people can be expelled just because they are difficult for governments to deal with, or dissident, or unpopular.</p> <p>Banishment might once have held a civic function in the ancient worlds of city states and empires. But denationalisation holds no rightful place in the modern world of nation-states.</p> <p>Its resurgence among liberal democracies, who pursue it arbitrarily, invidiously and, it appears, increasingly unlawfully, is a damaging and divisive trend that weakens the institution of citizenship for all, and makes the world less safe for everybody.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Disowning one\u2019s own citizens is back in vogue for governments around the world. Denationalisation is an old punishment. The Greek city states called it \u201cbanishment\u201d, expulsion beyond the city walls. The Romans practised \u201cdeportatio\u201d, where an unwanted person was physically taken, usually in chains, to the outer edges of the empire, and left, condemned to wander, unprotected, in the extremities. Then, as now, it was regarded as a form of civic death. Following the brutal experience of Europe in the 1930s and the displacement of the second world war, the practice of denationalisation \u2013 while it remained on statute books \u2013 fell largely into disuse. But following 9/11, it has come roaring back into vogue, practised almost exclusively by rich, powerful, western states and practised discriminatorily almost always against Muslim citizens. Australia has denationalised 17 citizens since 2015; the UK has revoked the citizenship of about 120 people since 2016. At almost every occasion, denationalisation is argued by governments as strengthening a country\u2019s citizenship by removing people who, by their beliefs or actions, never truly belonged anyway or are in some way undeserving of the \u201cprivilege\u201d of nationality. In truth, denationalisation weakens the citizenship of all, by making the fundamental right of having a nation to which to belong precarious and contingent on behaviour. There are four fundamental arguments why denationalisation is unjustified: Firstly, it risks leaving people stateless. While it is illegal under international law to make someone stateless, the unilateral and arbitrary way by which denationalisation is practised by countries such as the UK and Australia creates situations of effective statelessness. Australia stripped Melbourne-born Isis fighter Neil Prakash of his citizenship despite the fact he had no right to Fijian citizenship \u2013 as claimed by Australia \u2013 a country to which he\u2019d never been and to held no connection. This week, Australia stripped its citizenship from Melbourne woman and \u201cIsis bride\u201d Zehra Duman, claiming she held a Turkish passport. This has not been confirmed by Ankara: she may now, instead, be stateless. Duman has three young children who have also been left at risk of statelessness by Australia\u2019s unilateral action. Similarly, British-born Shamima Begum was stripped of her UK nationality and told she must apply for citizenship of Bangladesh, despite having never been there. Bangladesh, entirely unsurprisingly, refused to recognised her as its own citizen, leaving her in a limbo of effective statelessness. Statelessness is no mere bureaucratic inconvenience, it is deeply debilitating. The right to citizenship is, in Arendtian terms, the \u201cright to have rights\u201d, the fundamental franchise from which all others flow: the right to education, to medical care, to the protection of the law, to the vote. Secondly, denationalisation entrenches global inequality between rich, powerful countries and weak ones. In the 21st century, strong countries \u2013 almost invariably rich, western, liberal democracies \u2013 foist their problematic or politically awkward citizens onto weaker countries, less able to refuse them. On a moral level, countries are responsible for the citizens they create. Prakash is a product of Australia. Begum was born, raised and radicalised in the UK. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning \u201cJust like parents cannot simply turn their back on their children when they do something wrong,\u201d professor of politics and forced migration at Oxford University Matthew Gibney argues, \u201cso a state cannot simply palm off its own failures onto other states\u201d. But now that Prakash, Duman and Begum have become potentially dangerous, or political awkward, their supposed liberal democracies abandon them for other countries to contend with. This too is where the safety argument is most exposed. Discarding a radicalised citizen in a distant country, and outlawing them from returning, might make a liberal democracy ostensibly safer by one. But it makes the world a more dangerous place by foisting a potentially dangerous non-citizen on another country, one almost certainly less able to effectively manage and monitor that person. Abandoning a dangerous citizen like Prakash might make Australia fractionally more safe, but leaving him to an unknown fate is beyond negligent, it is culpable. The Australian Security and Intelligence Organisation argues laws that automatically strip citizenship from Australians who engage in terrorism-related conduct increase the risk of terrorism and make pressing charges against criminals harder. \u201cIn some instances, citizenship cessation will curtail the range of threat mitigation capabilities available to Australian authorities,\u201d Asio said in a submission to parliament. \u201cIt may also have unintended or unforeseen adverse security outcomes \u2013 potentially including reducing one manifestation of the terrorist threat while exacerbating another. \u201cThere may be occasions where the better security outcome would be that citizenship is retained, despite a person meeting the legislative criteria for citizenship cessation \u2013 for example, where the Australian Federal Police has criminal charges that could be pursued if the person were to remain an Australian citizen.\u201d Thirdly, denationalisation is invidious. The defining characteristics of modern citizenship are that it is secure, egalitarian and equalising. One citizen\u2019s inalienable right to vote is worth precisely that of any other. Denationalisation creates literal second-class citizens. Because, under international law, a state cannot render a person stateless, denationalisation creates two levels of citizenship: mono, which is secure and impregnable; and dual, which is precarious and contingent upon some arbitrary and potentially inconsistent government-declared standard of behaviour. People\u2019s dual citizenship \u2013 or even a tenuous possibility of a claim to a second nationality \u2013 is being used by countries to expel them permanently, to cast them as somewhere else\u2019s responsibility. Today it is jihadists who are denationalised, tomorrow climate protestors? Finally, denationalisation is often arbitrary. In most instances where it is practised, such as in the UK and Australia, denationalisation is the stroke of executive pen: it is carried out at the whim of governments, usually without parliamentary or judicial oversight, or any right of the (former) citizen to appeal. This is deeply undemocratic and raises real risk that people can be expelled just because they are difficult for governments to deal with, or dissident, or unpopular. Banishment might once have held a civic function in the ancient worlds of city states and empires. But denationalisation holds no rightful place in the modern world of nation-states. Its resurgence among liberal democracies, who pursue it arbitrarily, invidiously and, it appears, increasingly unlawfully, is a damaging and divisive trend that weakens the institution of citizenship for all, and makes the world less safe for everybody.",

But when you see notionally progressive Gen X leaders like the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/oct/10/extinction-rebellion-labor-members-say-chilling-mass-arrests-have-echoes-of-bjelke-petersen-era\">rushing through legislation</a> to prevent these protests you have to wonder not only what is the point of the ALP, but whether my generation is worse on climate change than baby boomers.</p> \n<p>Palaszczuk <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AnnastaciaMP/status/1181795716168945664\">tweeted</a> that \u201ceveryone has the right to protest in this state\u201d but then added the caveat: \u201cIt\u2019s when extreme protesters using dangerous devices put at risk our emergency services &amp; hinder people going about their daily business that it oversteps the mark.\u201d</p> \n<p>Forget that there is zero evidence that anyone in the Extinction Rebellion movement is using dangerous devices, but if hindering people going about their daily business is the new standard, then protest in the state has effectively become something allowed only in cases when it is neither seen nor heard. Which, it seems, would suit Palaszczuk just fine.</p> \n<p>It is rather disappointing that she is so eager to embrace laws that Joh Bjelke-Petersen and any number of conservative autocrats would embrace. After all she had to battle oppression and malevolent forces all through her youth to get to the point of *<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Palaszczuk\">checks notes</a>* taking over the safe parliamentary seat her father held for over a decade.</p> \n<p>Still, at least her opposition to climate change protest is not one that will see her alienated in the ALP.

      "bodyText": "One of my favourite lines in an article on the climate crisis is by American science journalist Sharon Begley: \u201cIf a rich technologically advanced nation won\u2019t put its own house in order, then developing countries have a perfect excuse to do nothing.\u201d She also wrote in the same article: \u201cFor those who fear that the greenhouse will arrive \u2013 and no responsible scientist denies that possibility \u2013 it seems imperative to take immediate steps to mitigate it.\u201d Great lines. Written 30 years ago. Begley wrote them in the same 1989 Newsweek magazine that reported on the fall of the Berlin Wall. It is astonishing how little has changed. In the same article she noted that car companies like Ford were strongly opposing any moves to introduce emission cuts that targeted the industry \u2013 \u201cit would throw industry into a tailspin and have minimal environmental impact\u201d, one spokesperson suggested. This week the Guardian found that car manufacturers have \u201cbeen pouring millions of dollars through industry bodies into lobbying efforts to challenge attempts to tackle global heating in the past four years\u201d. And in the 30 years since the fall of the Berlin Wall that nothing has changed is a damning indictment on our political and media systems. But it would be wrong to blame only those in power 30 years ago, for what we have seen this week is that blame can be well and truly passed down to the following generation of political leaders. Gen X is as guilty as the much-maligned baby boomers. As a member of that most cynical and sarcastic generation, who spent our youth mocking baby boomers who preached revolution and then sold out into the Me Generation as soon as a high-income tax cut and four-bedroom home with a two-car garage was dangled before their eyes, we must acknowledge that the answer to the question of \u201cAre we the baddies?\u201d is yes. All that cynicism has mostly been translated into complacency. Our media discourse this week was flooded with comments by 40- and 50-year-olds wondering who the Extinction Rebellion are trying to convince: \u201cI\u2019m all for action on climate change, but ... \u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t they realise you catch more flies with honey?\u201d We thought we were Rage Against the Machine but we are really FM Easy Listening. Thirty years of inaction. Thirty years of waiting. Thirty years of playing nice. If you think that strategy has worked, then you probably think the Queensland Labor party is a progressive government. You can understand the reaction to protesters by arch-conservative Gen Xers like the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, who it appears sees a day without stripping people of their civil liberties as a day wasted. But when you see notionally progressive Gen X leaders like the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, rushing through legislation to prevent these protests you have to wonder not only what is the point of the ALP, but whether my generation is worse on climate change than baby boomers. Palaszczuk tweeted that \u201ceveryone has the right to protest in this state\u201d but then added the caveat: \u201cIt\u2019s when extreme protesters using dangerous devices put at risk our emergency services &amp; hinder people going about their daily business that it oversteps the mark.\u201d Forget that there is zero evidence that anyone in the Extinction Rebellion movement is using dangerous devices, but if hindering people going about their daily business is the new standard, then protest in the state has effectively become something allowed only in cases when it is neither seen nor heard. Which, it seems, would suit Palaszczuk just fine. It is rather disappointing that she is so eager to embrace laws that Joh Bjelke-Petersen and any number of conservative autocrats would embrace. After all she had to battle oppression and malevolent forces all through her youth to get to the point of *checks notes* taking over the safe parliamentary seat her father held for over a decade. Still, at least her opposition to climate change protest is not one that will see her alienated in the ALP. This week, federal MP Joel Fitzgibbon suggested Labor should adopt the LNP\u2019s Paris agreement target of a 26%-28% cut in emissions from 2005 levels. That cut in reality is closer to 15% once you take into account carry-over credits and dodgy accounting, and which is massively short of the minimum 45% cut that scientists argue is needed. It is rather disappointing that Fitzgibbon is so eager to capitulate to the government. After all he had to had to battle oppression and malevolent forces all through his youth to get to the point of *checks notes* taking over the safe parliamentary seat his father held for over a decade. Look I get it \u2013 it is annoying to have your day disrupted. But don\u2019t come at me with arguments that amount to basically doing what has been done for 30 years and expecting anything real to happen. The problem is it has been easy to ignore climate-change activism and as a result ignore the issue completely. Nonviolent resistance is about resisting, not just being nonviolent. And it is about provoking the inevitable overreaction by those in power \u2013 the same overreaction that occurred during civil rights and anti-Vietnam war protests. An overreaction that saw the New South Wales and Victorian police demand bail conditions on protests so onerous you would assume they were dreamed up in a Palaszczuk-Dutton group chat. Thankfully those like the ALP\u2019s Mark Butler quickly condemned Fitzgibbon\u2019s suggestion, and others in the party have criticised Palaszczuk\u2019s new laws, so perhaps there remains some hope for it (but, as Richard Marles would suggest, prepare to be disappointed). This week also came a report from the IMF that suggested even with a $111 carbon price, Australia would be unable to meet its Paris target. When the Gillard government introduced a carbon price seven years ago it was just $23. That is the price of inaction. At some point we need to get angry, but if your anger is directed at those protesting rather than at parliamentarians then I suspect you have consigned yourself to expecting nothing to change. That\u2019s fine, but own it. Realise if you are annoyed by them it\u2019s because you have become more annoyed by protest than a lack of action. Don\u2019t pretend to still be seeking change when your anger is directed at those trying desperately to make up for the past 30 years of wasted cynicism and complacency. \u2022 Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist",

      "bodyText": "Film festivals have provided breakthrough moments for actors before now, but for Morfydd Clark to appear in three films, and to play two different roles in one of them, seems excessive. The Welsh actress has conquered this year\u2019s London Film Festival with triumphant appearances in The Personal History of David Copperfield and Eternal Beauty. And last night her third film, Saint Maud, directed by newcomer Rose Glass, received a prestigious special commendation in the festival\u2019s annual awards. The judges announced on Saturday night that the overall winner in the best film category was Alejandro Landes\u2019s acclaimed thriller Monos, a gripping portrayal of the lives of child soldiers. Yet they also took time to heap praise on Saint Maud, with the official competition jury president Wash Westmoreland declaring: \u201cThis dazzling directorial debut marks the emergence of a powerful new voice in British cinema.\u201d Clark, who grew up in Cardiff, plays the lead character in the psychological horror film, which tells the story of a troubled carer who becomes disturbingly fixated on the life of her latest charge, an ageing dancer. The actress, who is perhaps best known for her stage appearance as Cordelia at the Old Vic opposite Glenda Jackson\u2019s acclaimed King Lear, could also be seen at the festival in Eternal Beauty, a comedy drama from Craig Roberts, starring Sally Hawkins. She also amused audiences with her performance as Dora, David Copperfield\u2019s vapid first wife in Armando Iannucci\u2019s adaptation of the novel, chosen as the opening gala premiere.

Born in Sweden, where her father was working, Clark and her family returned to Wales when she was seven, where she was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD). Concentrating, she has since explained, is always much easier for her when she is performing. In this, the 63rd BFI London Film Festival, more than 60% of the films shown in competition were made by a female director or co-director, with producers from 16 countries represented. Tricia Tuttle, the festival\u2019s director, said on Saturday: \u201cOur awards highlight the most distinctive, urgent and accomplished filmmaking from around the globe, and it has been an incredible festival.

Ras al-Ayn\u2019s capture would mean Turkey could try to cut the road from the eastern Kurdish city Qamishli, the de facto capital, to all the other Kurdish positions west along the border. A Kurdish woman in the Turkish border town of Viran\u015fehir, originally from Ras al-Ayn, burst into tears watching the carnage unfold from her living room television set. \u201cThat was my neighbourhood and my house,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was all I had left and now it\u2019s gone.\u201d The small town was home to a diverse mix of Kurdish, Arab, Circassian and Armenian communities before the war began, she said. Now, if Erdo\u011fan sends Arab families from elsewhere in Syria to repopulate the border zone as planned, she fears she will never be able to return. \u201cThe [Syrian rebels] will never protect the Kurds,\u201d she said. \u201cWe all used to live together as neighbours and now they will put strangers in our homes.\u201d Additional reporting by Mohammed Rasool and Hussein Akkosh",

So what\u2019s the point? Why bother? Against Handke, I\u2019ll pitch the writer whose place on the podium in Stockholm in 1957 he stains: Albert Camus. Camus\u2019s magnificent acceptance speech was about how the duty of a writer is to do more than write, but also testify to truth. Ten years earlier, Camus published his masterpiece La peste, whose hero, Dr Rieux, adheres to a complex notion of pointless endeavour: one fights to save the life of an infected child although it is doomed \u2013 fight the plague, because that\u2019s the right thing to do. Although, in this value-free present, to cite Handke\u2019s predecessor of 2016, Bob Dylan: \u201cAt times I think there are no words/ But these to say what\u2019s true./ And there are no truths outside the Gates of Eden.\u201d \u2022Ed Vulliamy reported on the Yugoslav wars in the 1990s",

England are not good enough to do this all at once, to change personnel and shape, to give debuts to 20-year-olds all at the same time.

Why, in that case, drop the experienced, safe, unexhilarating Kyle Walker, who can play in a back three and is in good form for Manchester City?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fd3edbd3dac2b43f6756d41a62deebc759fe5eae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd3edbd3dac2b43f6756d41a62deebc759fe5eae/0_76_2559_1535/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Keane, Harry Maguire and Declan Rice, left to right, all endured a difficult evening in the defeat by Czech Republic in Prague.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Keane, Harry Maguire and Declan Rice, left to right, all endured a difficult evening in the defeat by Czech Republic in Prague.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin Setterfield/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Prague three of the front six were not yet 21. This is the Southgate way, a high-turnover, high-throttle approach to the interchangeable unit that is the England team: more youth, more energy, ever more biddable young players. At one stage during the current break Southgate even talked about calling up Bukayo Saka, just turned 18 with four professional games behind him.</p> <p>Which is fine talk but not the way winning teams have operated in recent history. France won the World Cup with a team of well-seasoned favourites, leavened with Champions League-ready young blood. A stodgy, orderly Portugal won the last Euros. Spain were orderly, settled winners before that.</p> <p>Things that work in international football should be cherished. And yet the talk now is of another switch back to playing with three at the back. Careful what you wish for. When England changed to the current back four, Raheem Sterling had two goals in 40 caps. Since the related switch to a three-man frontline against Spain last October, he has eight goals in nine games. Why risk this powerful weapon with tinkering elsewhere? Why not simply follow the Liverpool template of a gristly three-man midfield, seasoned by the craft of a deeper-lying Mount?</p> <p>Some will point to Southgate\u2019s lack of experience in club management as a factor here, the contrast with the slightly wild free hand he has with England to select and rejig as he sees fit. Change is good, grand plans are good, new blood is good. But it comes with a warning too. England got theirs in Prague, a match that offered a reminder of their level right now and of the precarious nature of those recent gains.</p>",

England are not good enough to do this all at once, to change personnel and shape, to give debuts to 20-year-olds all at the same time. Even the selection for the games against the Czech Republic and Bulgaria is a little reckless. There have been complaints from the manager about the difficulty of switching to a back three with this squad and about the poor club form of some of the players. Why, in that case, drop the experienced, safe, unexhilarating Kyle Walker, who can play in a back three and is in good form for Manchester City? In Prague three of the front six were not yet 21. This is the Southgate way, a high-turnover, high-throttle approach to the interchangeable unit that is the England team: more youth, more energy, ever more biddable young players. At one stage during the current break Southgate even talked about calling up Bukayo Saka, just turned 18 with four professional games behind him. Which is fine talk but not the way winning teams have operated in recent history. France won the World Cup with a team of well-seasoned favourites, leavened with Champions League-ready young blood. A stodgy, orderly Portugal won the last Euros. Spain were orderly, settled winners before that. Things that work in international football should be cherished. And yet the talk now is of another switch back to playing with three at the back. Careful what you wish for. When England changed to the current back four, Raheem Sterling had two goals in 40 caps. Since the related switch to a three-man frontline against Spain last October, he has eight goals in nine games. Why risk this powerful weapon with tinkering elsewhere? Why not simply follow the Liverpool template of a gristly three-man midfield, seasoned by the craft of a deeper-lying Mount? Some will point to Southgate\u2019s lack of experience in club management as a factor here, the contrast with the slightly wild free hand he has with England to select and rejig as he sees fit. Change is good, grand plans are good, new blood is good. But it comes with a warning too. England got theirs in Prague, a match that offered a reminder of their level right now and of the precarious nature of those recent gains.",

As Turkish forces continued to battle south for a third consecutive day, a senior commander of the Syrian Democratic Forces confirmed that Kurdish troops guarding the Isis suspects would likely be redeployed to the frontline soon. \u201cThe protection of Isis prisons will not remain our priority,\u201d said an SDF commander during a press conference on Saturday. \u201cThe defence of our soil will be prioritised if [the] Turkish military continues its attacks.\u201d The development raises the likelihood of breakouts from prisons that are already considered by western officials to be understaffed and volatile. As Turkish fighters attempted to reach the strategic M4 highway linking the main cities of the north, reports emerged from the Rojava Information Centre, a Kurdish media collective, that attempts to target prisons may have already begun. Officials said that a car bomb had detonated outside an Isis prison called Ghuwairan on Friday night near the city of Hasakah. During the same night reports also emerged that five Isis fighters had escaped from Navkur prison in nearby Qamishli during chaos triggered by a Turkish airstrike. Intelligence obtained by Kurdish forces in northern Syria has confirmed that Isis sleeper cells and suicide bombers are operating in the region with the primary intention of targeting prisons in a bid to liberate former fighters. Last month Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of Isis, urged his followers to start freeing jihadists and their wives and children from detention camps in Iraq and Syria. Since the Turkish invasion began, the west has been concerned with what happens to the huge pool of Isis prisoners, as security crumbles under the ongoing offensive. Before the fighting began, SDF forces operated a network of camps that held as many as 100,000 suspected Isis members and their wives, including scores of British nationals. About 12,000 suspected Isis fighters \u2013 a third of them foreign nationals \u2013 are detained in seven prisons further south close to the city of Raqqa, where reports of a series of attacks emerged shortly after Turkey invaded. To the south-east, disorder including an escape attempt has already been reported in the huge al-Hawl displacement camp where 70,000 women and children, including tens of thousands of family members of Isis fighters, are being held in chaotic conditions. Figures from the Rojava Information Centre on Saturday said 45 civilians had been killed as a result of Turkish artillery bombardment, with another 85 injured. A spokesman said: \u201cThe number of casualties may be higher since our team is unable to reach many of the targeted sites because of the Turkish warplanes and artillery, as well as the indiscriminate firing.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "UK police have been blamed for a cross-Channel farce that led to an innocent man being arrested and mistakenly identified as a fugitive wanted in connection with five murders. In France \u201chigh level\u201d sources told journalists that Interpol in London had alerted them that 58-year-old suspect Xavier Dupont de Ligonn\u00e8s, would be on a flight from Paris to Glasgow this weekend. French investigators have been trying since 2011 \u2013 without success \u2013 to establish whether Dupont de Ligonn\u00e8s is alive, after the bodies of his wife and four children were discovered buried under the terrace of the family home in the French city of Nantes. After the alleged tipoff, Scottish police arrested a man as he stepped off the flight. Le Parisien newspaper reported that Scottish officers then called their French counterparts to insist: \u201cThis is your man.\u201d In fact, the man was not Dupont de Ligonn\u00e8s, but Portuguese-born Guy Joao, who lives in Limay, in the Yvelines, north-west of Paris, and who spent the night in custody. After DNA and fingerprint testing, Joao was released. In a statement, Police Scotland said the man arrested at Glasgow Airport had been released: \u201cHe was held in police custody in connection with a European Arrest Warrant issued by the French authorities. \u201cInquiries were undertaken to confirm the man\u2019s identity. Following the results of these tests it has been confirmed that the man arrested is not the man suspected of crimes in France.\u201d On Saturday morning, as French investigators travelled to Glasgow, public prosecutor Pierre Senn\u00e8s had urged the press to \u201cexercise caution\u201d, saying \u201cverifications\u201d as to the identity of the suspect were underway. \u201cTeams of detectives from the national service for the research into fugitives and from the Nantes police would be travelling to Glasgow on Saturday,\u201d Senn\u00e8s said. However, the story, broken by Le Parisien on Friday evening and picked up by Agence France-Presse, which said it confirmed the identification of Dupont de Ligonn\u00e8s with four separate police sources, spread. Le Parisien newspaper, citing \u201chigh level sources\u201d placed the blame for the \u201ctheatrical misunderstanding\u201d firmly on the UK side, claiming Interpol\u2019s London office had contacted the French authorities to alert them that the man thought to be Dupont de Ligonn\u00e8s would be flying from Paris to Glasgow on Saturday using a passport stolen in 2014. Le Parisian reported: \u201cBut another theatrical event happened Friday: the English authorities alerted the French to a change in the reservation of the suspect\u2019s ticket, meaning he would actually take off this Friday at Roissy. With little time and with the impossibility to send a surveillance team, the French investigators asked their Scottish colleagues to go ahead and arrest the suspect as he got off the plane at Glasgow Airport.

Scottish police told us and they repeated it: this is your manHowever, despite several French demands, Scottish police refused to send them the fingerprints taken at Glasgow.\u201d Scottish police refused to respond to the French accusations when contacted by the Guardian. The story of what became known as the \u201cde Ligonn\u00e8s affair\u201d has puzzled and fascinated professional and amateur detectives, leading to genuine theories and conspiracy theories, many of them supported by members of the family. Investigators have followed leads suggesting the family emigrated secretly to the US or Australia, but they insist Dupont de Ligonn\u00e8s remains the prime suspect and the most likely scenario is that he killed himself after killing his family. His wife, Agn\u00e8s, 47, her eldest son, Arthur, 20, from her first marriage, Thomas, 18, and Anne, 16, were shot twice in the head. The youngest child, Beno\u00eet, 13, was shot three times in the head and twice in the thorax. Detectives believe Dupont de Ligonn\u00e8s killed Agn\u00e8s and three of the children on the night of 3-4 April and Thomas the following evening. The bodies were placed in jute sacks and covered in lime to speed up decomposition and disguise their smell. Postmortem examinations found the five victims had been given sleeping tablets and were shot with a .22 long rifle. Dupont de Ligonn\u00e8s had inherited a gun of the same make and calibre from his father three weeks earlier. Since 2011, there have been more than 900 purported sightings of Dupont de Ligonn\u00e8s reported to police, all of which have yielded nothing.",

      "body": "<h2><strong>Q: We are all familiar with Stephen King and Dean Koontz, but can anyone recommend some modern horror?</strong></h2> <p><em>Woolie Madden, 30, Montreal</em></p> <p><strong>A: Paul Tremblay, author and editor of horror and dark fantasy, writes</strong>:<br>You\u2019re in luck, as horror is experiencing a renaissance, not only in terms of increased cultural cache but also in diversity of approach and subject matter. A reflection of our 21st-century anxieties and nightmares, modern horror has mainlined into the zeitgeist.</p> <p>My first recommendations are two short story collections. Laird Barron\u2019s <em>Occultation</em><em> </em>is a literate blend of noir, pulp adventure and his unique cosmic horrors, equal parts terror and awe. While his isn\u2019t a household name yet (it should be), you can find his influence on more than one pop culture event from the past decade, including the first season of the television show <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/true-detective\" title=\"\">True Detective</a></em>. Mariana Enr\u00edquez\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/nov/02/things-we-lost-in-the-fire-by-mariana-enriquez-review\" title=\"\">Things We Lost in the Fire</a></em><em>, </em>meanwhile,<em> </em>deftly demonstrates the genre\u2019s range and power, mixing realism with the supernatural, horror with sociopolitics. The collection\u2019s opening story, The Dirty Boy \u2013about a woman in a decaying apartment building who attempts to help a homeless child \u2013 is as raw and terrifying a tale as you\u2019ll find.</p> <p>Sarah Waters\u2019s gothic novel <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/may/23/little-stranger-sarah-waters\" title=\"\">The Little Stranger</a></em> is similarly rooted in realism and modern sensibilities. Elegantly written, the novel is set in rural England after the second world war and explores decaying aristocracy, class and socialism before insidiously transforming into a ghost story. The struggles of family and country are reflected by the atmosphere of dread within Hundreds Hall.</p> <p>John Langan\u2019s <em>The Fisherman</em> is an 80s-style horror novel that recalls some of the best of Stephen King and Peter Straub.

      "bodyText": "Q: We are all familiar with Stephen King and Dean Koontz, but can anyone recommend some modern horror? Woolie Madden, 30, Montreal A: Paul Tremblay, author and editor of horror and dark fantasy, writes: You\u2019re in luck, as horror is experiencing a renaissance, not only in terms of increased cultural cache but also in diversity of approach and subject matter. A reflection of our 21st-century anxieties and nightmares, modern horror has mainlined into the zeitgeist. My first recommendations are two short story collections. Laird Barron\u2019s Occultation is a literate blend of noir, pulp adventure and his unique cosmic horrors, equal parts terror and awe. While his isn\u2019t a household name yet (it should be), you can find his influence on more than one pop culture event from the past decade, including the first season of the television show True Detective. Mariana Enr\u00edquez\u2019s Things We Lost in the Fire, meanwhile, deftly demonstrates the genre\u2019s range and power, mixing realism with the supernatural, horror with sociopolitics. The collection\u2019s opening story, The Dirty Boy \u2013about a woman in a decaying apartment building who attempts to help a homeless child \u2013 is as raw and terrifying a tale as you\u2019ll find. Sarah Waters\u2019s gothic novel The Little Stranger is similarly rooted in realism and modern sensibilities. Elegantly written, the novel is set in rural England after the second world war and explores decaying aristocracy, class and socialism before insidiously transforming into a ghost story. The struggles of family and country are reflected by the atmosphere of dread within Hundreds Hall. John Langan\u2019s The Fisherman is an 80s-style horror novel that recalls some of the best of Stephen King and Peter Straub. The story opens with a widower\u2019s grief and a fishing trip before jumping timelines and expanding into soaring, folkloric madness and terror, building to a monstrously epic conclusion. Victor LaValle confronts one of modern horror\u2019s biggest influences in his novella The Ballad of Black Tom. He reshapes and recontextualizes HP Lovecraft\u2019s most notoriously racist and xenophobic short story, The Horror at Red Hook, creating his own unflinching horror. His terrific novel The Changeling is a thrilling, oddly hopeful and scary riff on the anxieties of modern parenting and our often ugly, interconnected world. Paul Tremblay\u2019s most recent novel is The Cabin at the End of the World (Titan Books). Submit your question for book clinic below or email bookclinic@observer.co.uk",

      "body": "<p>Svetlana Alexievich came to London last week to receive the annual <a href=\"http://www.rawinwar.org\">RAW in WAR</a> Anna Politkovskaya award for women human rights defenders<strong> </strong>and to give a lecture commemorating the work of the murdered Russian journalist. Alexievich\u2019s book <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jun/24/last-witnesses-unchildlike-stories-svetlana-alexievich-review\" title=\"\">Last Witnesses: Unchildlike Stories</a></em> was published in June in the UK, more than three decades after it first appeared in the USSR to critical acclaim. It is based on interviews with a Soviet generation that experienced the second world war as children and has lived ever since with trauma. In 2015 Alexievich, now 71, won the Nobel prize for literature. The committee praised \u201cher polyphonic writings, a monument to suffering and courage in our time\u201d. She lives in Minsk, Belarus, and is currently writing books about love and death.</p> <p><strong>Why are you in the UK?</strong><br>I came because of Anna [Politkovskaya]. I loved and respected her so much. We met in 2005 at a prize ceremony in Oslo. There were many people there but Anna was somehow on her own, separate from the others. She was a person of extreme integrity bordering on fanaticism. We had a coffee, talked. There was one theme that united us: war. She was traumatised, at that point very close to a nervous breakdown, and full of pain and frustration. Anna was unhappy that she couldn\u2019t explain the situation [in Chechnya]. She wasn\u2019t able to make the west understand. She told me about the threats she was receiving. Her assassination [in 2006] came as a complete shock. I knew from our conversations that she was more or less prepared for this to happen. As a writer, I imagine what she was going through when she entered the lift of her apartment and the killer was there. It\u2019s hard to imagine.</p> <p><strong>What made you write </strong><em><strong>Last Witnesses</strong></em><strong>?</strong><br>When I grew up the main topic of conversation was the war. I was so impressed by all these stories. I never found anything like them in books, even though my parents were village teachers and their house was full of them. I heard about war whenever I stepped out of my house, or talked to my Ukrainian grandmother. As a student at university in a militaristic state, our victory was everywhere. It overshadowed things like the gulag. I couldn\u2019t reconcile this official version of the war with what I knew from my own experience. I was travelling across the country, gathering material for my newspaper, when I spoke to a mother and her daughter. My feeling was that you could make a new form of novel just from these voices. You could tell the story of the war in a slightly different way by creating a sort of epic work. I realised there was a different level of pain from children who were there.</p> <p><strong>What stories stick with you?</strong><br>The Germans thought that blood taken from children would help the wounded. I tell the story of how German soldiers \u2013 fragrant and well-dressed \u2013 turned up at an orphanage. The children thought they were their daddies. They were rushing to the soldiers, trying to be as close to them as possible. Soviet literature talks about children as pioneer heroes or sons of the regiment. There is a male culture which legitimises war. My idea was to write a book in such a way that even generals would feel disgusted by the idea of war. War is a monstrosity, a form of cannibalism.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jun/24/last-witnesses-unchildlike-stories-svetlana-alexievich-review\">Last Witnesses: Unchildlike Stories by Svetlana Alexievich review \u2013 a masterpiece of clear-eyed humility</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>What happened to your subjects in later life?</strong><br>Most children caught up in war die early. I wrote my book at the right time. One man told me to put his memories down before it was too late. It was important for them to leave something behind, to give their testimonies.</p> <p><strong>What books are on your bedside table?</strong><br>I\u2019m writing two books now. One is about love, about men and women. The other concerns old age and at what point human beings feel it is time to go to the darkness. Love is tricky. In Russian literature we only have love at the early stage. After that, the man either goes to prison or to war. It\u2019s a big problem. Our culture is one of conflict and barricades. I\u2019m reading <em>The Tibetan </em><em>Book of the </em><em>Dead</em>. And <em><a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/4744/the-hour-of-our-death-by-philipe-aries-translated-from-the-french-by-helen-weaver/\" title=\"\">The Hour of Our Death</a></em> by the French historian Philippe Ari\u00e8s. I\u2019m also reading Jonathan Littell\u2019s <em>The Kindly Ones</em>, a fictional memoir of an SS officer.</p> <p><strong>Which</strong><strong> writers working today do you admire the most?</strong><br>Russian poet Olga Sedakova. She has a broad vision of the world. Her work is written in <em>vers libre</em>. This is unusual for Russia. She\u2019s a complicated individual, very well educated, a religious person and a very interesting poet. Also, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/oct/11/haruki-murakami-interview-killing-commendatore\" title=\"\">Haruki M</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/oct/11/haruki-murakami-interview-killing-commendatore\" title=\"\">ur</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/oct/11/haruki-murakami-interview-killing-commendatore\" title=\"\">akami</a>.

His <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/crime-and-punishment-9780198709718.html\" title=\"\">Crime and Punishment</a></em> and <em>Demons</em>. He goes deep into human beings, the way he sees the darkness inside the soul and illuminates it. My favourite literary hero is Dostoevsky himself. He\u2019s both hero and antihero. It\u2019s an awful thing that Russian writers don\u2019t generally live much beyond 50, with the obvious exception of Tolstoy. Chekhov was dead by 44.</p> <p><strong>What book would you give to a young person?</strong><br>Marina Tsvetaeva\u2019s diaries and notebooks. She manages to catch what she feels, to write words that have already been purified, to record what we whisper to ourselves before we wake up and this vanishes. She deals in what I call alive words.</p> <p><strong>How do you feel about our troubled political era?</strong><br>People have gone back to the middle ages, to medieval prejudices.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump came to the defence of Rudy Giuliani on Saturday, only a day after he said he didn\u2019t know if the former New York mayor was still his personal attorney and it was reported that Giuliani is under federal investigation in Manhattan. Giuliani \u201cmay seem a little rough around the edges\u201d, Trump tweeted, \u201cbut he is also a great guy and wonderful lawyer\u201d. The president did not say whether or not Giuliani was still his personal attorney. The former mayor said on Friday he was. Giuliani is under pressure over his extra-governmental role in Trump\u2019s attempts to pressure Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden, a potential opponent in the 2020 election, over unfounded allegations of corruption involving the former vice-president\u2019s son. The Ukraine scandal is driving a formal impeachment inquiry by Democrats on Capitol Hill. Two Soviet-born US citizens, both associates of Giuliani, were arrested on Wednesday on suspicion of campaign finance violations, while trying to leave the US on one-way tickets. On Friday, the New York Times reported that Giuliani himself was under federal investigation over his work on and in Ukraine. The same paper also reported that in 2017 Giuliani tried to get a client released as part of a prisoner swap with Turkey, a move blocked by Trump\u2019s first secretary of state, Rex Tillerson. Trump has seemed recently to begin to distance himself from Giuliani, amid reports that allies of the president want the voluble former mayor to keep quiet. The impeachment inquiry run by House Democrats is gathering pace, dragging the state department and senior diplomats into a morass of hearings, subpoenas and bare-knuckle political fights. On Friday the former US ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch testified in private before House committees conducting the impeachment inquiry, having defied White House and state department efforts to block her. Discussing her controversial removal, Yovanovitch said: \u201cThe harm will come when private interests circumvent professional diplomats for their own gain, not the public good.\u201d As he left the White House for a campaign rally in Louisiana, the president was asked if Giuliani was still his personal attorney. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI haven\u2019t spoken to Rudy. I spoke to him yesterday briefly. He\u2019s a very good attorney, and he has been my attorney.\u201d Giuliani told the Washington Post he was still representing Trump. On Saturday, a Yahoo News reporter said he had \u201cjust texted\u201d with Giuliani, who said \u201che never worried Trump would cast him aside and attributed reports of a potential rift to people \u2018leaking to be malicious\u2019.\u201d Analysts have questioned the common description of Giuliani as Trump\u2019s lawyer, given the apparently non-legal nature of his work. Giuliani has suggested attorney-client privilege would protect him from congressional scrutiny. That notion has been placed in doubt. Trump\u2019s former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, is serving a three-year jail term for crimes including campaign finance violations he says were committed by order of his boss. It was reported this month that Cohen wants to write a tell-all book, once he regains his freedom. On Saturday morning, after leaving the White House for his golf course in Sterling, Virginia, Trump tweeted: \u201cSo now they are after the legendary \u2018crime buster\u2019 and greatest Mayor in the history of NYC, Rudy Giuliani.

      "bodyText": "Legislation that would force developers and landlords to comply with rigorous new safety standards will be announced in the Queen\u2019s speech on Monday with the aim of preventing a repeat of the Grenfell Tower disaster. Ministers say that the creation of a new buildings safety regulator will be the biggest reform of the sector in 40 years, imposing far stronger obligations on those responsible for the safety of high-rise buildings throughout design, construction and occupation. The long-awaited report from the public inquiry into the Grenfell Tower fire on 14 June 2017, which claimed 72 lives, is due to be published within weeks. Other bills to be announced include measures to support the NHS and the police, which Boris Johnson says will make the United Kingdom \u201cthe greatest place on earth\u201d, once the government has completed Brexit and is able to concentrate on domestic priorities. But with the prime minister lacking a Commons majority, and his hopes of a Brexit deal on a knife edge, there is a real possibility that the Queen\u2019s speech in its entirety could be voted down by parliament for the first time since 1924 \u2013 adding to the sense of political chaos and uncertainty at Westminster. While the loss of the Queen\u2019s speech would inevitably lead to calls from opposition parties for the prime minister to resign, Downing Street has made it clear that Johnson would carry on and merely use such an outcome to amplify his calls for a general election. To emphasise that Brexit is the government\u2019s No\u20091 priority, the Queen\u2019s speech will contain plans for a withdrawal agreement bill that ministers hope will pass by 31 October.

Among the 22 new bills will be Brexit-related legislation to ensure faster access to innovative medicines and measures to introduce \u201ca fair global immigration system\u201d. Johnson said: \u201cGetting Brexit done by 31 October is absolutely crucial, and we are continuing to work on an exit deal so we can move on to negotiating a future relationship based on free trade and friendly cooperation with our European friends. \u201cBut the people of this country don\u2019t just want us to sort out Brexit.

      "body": "<p>The women are coming: dark, dangerous, different. A good week for female choreographers brought two works that are unlike anything before, even though both have something to do with a name familiar from the origins of Romantic ballet.</p> <p><strong>Crowd</strong>, choreographed by the French dance-maker Gis\u00e8le Vienne, opened Dance Umbrella 2019 (which will feature many more female creators, Oona Doherty and Lucy Guerin among them). With its roots in Vienne\u2019s experiences in 1990s Berlin clubland, and a pounding techno score from artists such as Jeff Mills, Global Communication and Underground Resistance, it feels both like a particularly wild party and a triptych on the theme of heaven and hell by a painter such as Bosch. The setting also makes it bear a resemblance to Pina Bausch\u2019s <em>Rite of Spring.</em></p> <p>Opening as it means to go on, <em>Crowd</em> sets its 15 dancers moving in very, very slo-mo across an empty landscape of compacted mud, scattered with the detritus of a good night out. They look like the average reveller in their hoodies and sparkly shoes, but also like explorers on an alien planet. The movement is mesmeric but normal; these are natural gestures slowed down to the point where each pulse of each muscle is highlighted. The effect is both transfixing and slightly disorienting.</p> <p>Under Patrick Riou\u2019s sharply sculptural lighting, the scene most resembles those slowed-down Bill Viola videos that turn human beings into medieval portraits of saints. But the people we are watching are undoubtedly sinners, fallible humans not gods. As the unbroken 90 minutes progresses, small narratives emerge all over the stage \u2013 fights, kisses, stories of longing, lust and loss. You identify people who maintain their characters throughout: there\u2019s a Christ-like loner, a brawling man, a sexy girl, a shopping-bag lady. There\u2019s a sense of story slightly beyond your grasp.</p> <p>Sometimes the movement becomes marginally faster, as the performers dance as at a rave, their raised jerky arms creating shapes that float across the space like the opening petals of a flower or the fierce breaking of a wave. At one startling moment, the music stops and they lie on the floor like the fallen, their bodies broken by exertion and pain. It\u2019s a dazzling piece, transfixing and strangely resonant.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6akUYXrTN4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/G6akUYXrTN4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6akUYXrTN4\">Watch a trailer for Crowd.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Dada Masilo\u2019s<strong> Giselle</strong> also makes its mark. This is yet another interpretation of the archetypal Romantic ballet about class war (an aristocrat tricks a peasant girl), betrayal (he steals her heart and then abandons her) and forgiveness (which is what she does at the end). However radical productions have been, they generally keep that arc. But not Masilo.</p> <p>In the early scenes, the South African choreographer vividly creates a picture of villagers and landowners, bound in inequality by tradition. Giselle and Albrecht dance tenderly sensual duets; when he leaves after seducing her, she is curled like a child. She dreams then of the Wilis, led by Llewellyn Mnguni\u2019s utterly terrifying Myrtha, a healer, but one who seeks retribution. After Giselle\u2019s betrayal, these warrior women (and men) reappear to take her side with relentless and unforgiving force.</p> <p>Masilo\u2019s choreography mixes traditional African folk dance with contemporary and ballet to vigorous and emotional effect. Her use of colour is striking: Giselle doesn\u2019t live and die in pastel shades but in vivid Technicolor, with the red-clad Wilis tracking their victims against a bright green sky. In the title role, Masilo herself, shaven-headed and apparently vulnerable, turns her Giselle into an after-death whirlwind, relentless in her pursuit of nasty Albrecht (beautifully danced by Lwando Dutyulwa). As she blew dust over his broken body, a symbol of her own liberation, it was hard not to raise a cheer.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hz-YisMzDvE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hz-YisMzDvE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hz-YisMzDvE\">Watch a trailer for Dada Masilo\u2019s Giselle.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p><em>Star ratings (out of five)<br>Crowd </em>\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605<em><br>Giselle </em>\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605</p>",

A good week for female choreographers brought two works that are unlike anything before, even though both have something to do with a name familiar from the origins of Romantic ballet. Crowd, choreographed by the French dance-maker Gis\u00e8le Vienne, opened Dance Umbrella 2019 (which will feature many more female creators, Oona Doherty and Lucy Guerin among them). With its roots in Vienne\u2019s experiences in 1990s Berlin clubland, and a pounding techno score from artists such as Jeff Mills, Global Communication and Underground Resistance, it feels both like a particularly wild party and a triptych on the theme of heaven and hell by a painter such as Bosch. The setting also makes it bear a resemblance to Pina Bausch\u2019s Rite of Spring. Opening as it means to go on, Crowd sets its 15 dancers moving in very, very slo-mo across an empty landscape of compacted mud, scattered with the detritus of a good night out. They look like the average reveller in their hoodies and sparkly shoes, but also like explorers on an alien planet. The movement is mesmeric but normal; these are natural gestures slowed down to the point where each pulse of each muscle is highlighted. The effect is both transfixing and slightly disorienting. Under Patrick Riou\u2019s sharply sculptural lighting, the scene most resembles those slowed-down Bill Viola videos that turn human beings into medieval portraits of saints. But the people we are watching are undoubtedly sinners, fallible humans not gods. As the unbroken 90 minutes progresses, small narratives emerge all over the stage \u2013 fights, kisses, stories of longing, lust and loss. You identify people who maintain their characters throughout: there\u2019s a Christ-like loner, a brawling man, a sexy girl, a shopping-bag lady. There\u2019s a sense of story slightly beyond your grasp. Sometimes the movement becomes marginally faster, as the performers dance as at a rave, their raised jerky arms creating shapes that float across the space like the opening petals of a flower or the fierce breaking of a wave. At one startling moment, the music stops and they lie on the floor like the fallen, their bodies broken by exertion and pain. It\u2019s a dazzling piece, transfixing and strangely resonant. Dada Masilo\u2019s Giselle also makes its mark. This is yet another interpretation of the archetypal Romantic ballet about class war (an aristocrat tricks a peasant girl), betrayal (he steals her heart and then abandons her) and forgiveness (which is what she does at the end). However radical productions have been, they generally keep that arc. But not Masilo. In the early scenes, the South African choreographer vividly creates a picture of villagers and landowners, bound in inequality by tradition. Giselle and Albrecht dance tenderly sensual duets; when he leaves after seducing her, she is curled like a child. She dreams then of the Wilis, led by Llewellyn Mnguni\u2019s utterly terrifying Myrtha, a healer, but one who seeks retribution. After Giselle\u2019s betrayal, these warrior women (and men) reappear to take her side with relentless and unforgiving force. Masilo\u2019s choreography mixes traditional African folk dance with contemporary and ballet to vigorous and emotional effect. Her use of colour is striking: Giselle doesn\u2019t live and die in pastel shades but in vivid Technicolor, with the red-clad Wilis tracking their victims against a bright green sky. In the title role, Masilo herself, shaven-headed and apparently vulnerable, turns her Giselle into an after-death whirlwind, relentless in her pursuit of nasty Albrecht (beautifully danced by Lwando Dutyulwa). As she blew dust over his broken body, a symbol of her own liberation, it was hard not to raise a cheer. Star ratings (out of five) Crowd \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Giselle \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605",

It didn\u2019t help that, as foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, the blundering idiot, said that Zaghari-Ratcliffe was teaching journalism in Iran (she was on holiday).</p> <p>Now, even as Richard Ratcliffe hugs Gabriella and says: \u201cLet\u2019s hope that this homecoming unlocks another\u201d, there\u2019s the sense of an ordinary woman suspended helplessly in a geopolitical web that\u2019s more tangled by the second.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in August, 19-year-old Harry Dunn was riding his motorbike near RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/11/harry-dunn-family-flying-us-seek-justice-son-diplomats-wife\" title=\"\">when he was killed</a> after colliding with a car allegedly driven by US diplomat\u2019s wife Anne Sacoolas, who then returned to America, claiming diplomatic immunity. Johnson requested that she return to Britain for questioning. However, Donald Trump\u2019s briefing notes were spotted at a press conference, saying that Sacoolas would not be returning. Not that Trump used these notes, preferring to ad-lib about how Americans sometimes drove on the wrong side of the road in Britain (\u201cit happens\u201d) and how they would \u201csee what we can come up with, so there can be some healing\u201d. Marvellous. Perhaps he is thinking of sending the Dunn family some crystals?</p> <p>Denouncing Trump\u2019s attitude as \u201coafish\u201d, the Dunns also called foreign secretary Dominic Raab\u2019s handling of their case \u201ccold and strange\u201d. Again, there\u2019s the sense of ordinary people trapped in a grotesque web, reliant on British representatives rendered powerless.</p> <p>Of course, these are two very different situations with no simple solutions. What they have in common is that both families have suffered appallingly, with Johnson\u2019s inadequacy placed centre stage. First, there was his fudging of the Zaghari-Ratcliffe case; now his supposed special relationship with Trump vanishes at the first sign of trouble. It wasn\u2019t even that Trump couldn\u2019t help \u2013 rather, that he couldn\u2019t care less about not helping, not even bothering to read from prepared notes. This should ring alarm bells for our future.

There\u2019s tension in the Cotswolds, where the vicar of Britain\u2019s \u201cmost haunted\u201d village, Prestbury in Gloucestershire, has <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-gloucestershire-49999788\" title=\"\">banned tour operator</a> Cotswold Ghost Tours from hosting walks in the graveyard.</p> <p>One of the Rev Nick Bromfield\u2019s points is that he finds it unacceptable for hen parties and ghost hunters to be tramping through the graveyardabout, perhaps straying unwittingly close to new graves. However, I also feel sympathy for the tour operators trying to make the most of Prestbury\u2019s reputation, which includes tales of a ghostly horseman, hooves pounding for all eternity.</p> <p>Let\u2019s hope that a compromise can be reached. Vicars need to realise that graveyards often become chill-out zones for adolescents of the gloomier persuasion, wishing to gather to sip cheap, lukewarm alcohol from two-litre bottles and pretentiously discuss death. Yes, goths, and they have to go somewhere.</p> <p>This is why all clergy should think twice before taking the radical step of goth removal. If they\u2019re not careful, they could be forced into public areas, with their crimped hair, charity shop cravats and Strongbow bottles, and locals would soon be fondly reminiscing about when trick or treat happened just once a year.</p> <h2>Streaming?

Sunrise Records boss, Doug Putman, rescued 100 HMV stores in February and intends to defy online and streaming trends, offering 80,000 CDs and 25,000 vinyl albums in the Birmingham store, as well as film, TV, books, technology, merchandise and a stage for bands. Putman also promised that HMV would \u201cpay tax\u201d \u2013 take that, Amazon.</p> <p>Canadian Putman, a \u201cvinyl nut\u201d, seems to be the kind of customer he\u2019s trying to attract, which always helps. Certainly, he realises that it\u2019s key to create a sense of community among music lovers, making it not just about buying, but also about hanging out. For vinyl obsessives, this could also mean... vindication at last! A photo shows him grinning among the racks of vinyl and CDs, looking as though he\u2019s rummaging at an old-school record fair. As someone who, in her rock chick days, used to stagger and crunch in heels across a carpet of discarded records to get to the turntable, against a backdrop of horrified screams from more \u201cfastidious\u201d music lovers, I\u2019d be the first to admit this is not my world. However, Maybe I must belatedly concede that this is my loss.</p> <p>Vinyl and CD heads have always been easy to stereotype: still dressing in band tour T-shirts long into middle age; perhaps prone to becoming a little over-excited at the discovery of limited edition, picture-disc \u201cwaxings\u201d with original inner sleeves. However, the direction taken by HMV indicates that they were right all along. Their formats of choice have not only survived, they have prospered. Moreover, their tastes have evolved into a viable mainstream business model \u2013 not only evoking the past, but also the future, maybe even the saviour of high street rock\u2019n\u2019roll.</p> <p>\u2022 Barbara Ellen is an Observer columnist</p>",

      "bodyText": "Scenes of a little girl being reunited with her father on British soil looked wonderful, but were misleading \u2013 there\u2019s no happy ending yet. In 2016, Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was wrongly sentenced to five years for spying in Iran. While her husband returned to the UK to campaign for her release, their daughter, Gabriella, now five, lived with the maternal grandparents, visiting her mother weekly in prison. Now that Gabriella is back in Britain to start school, Richard Ratcliffe fears that his distraught wife will further deteriorate mentally and physically. While Zaghari-Ratcliffe is happy that the Australian government managed to secure the release from Iran of dual British-Australian citizen Jolie King and her Australian boyfriend, Mark Firkin, within months, she\u2019s increasingly desperate for freedom herself. What\u2019s the hold-up? The smart money is on a \u00a3400m arms debt, owed by Britain to Iran. It didn\u2019t help that, as foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, the blundering idiot, said that Zaghari-Ratcliffe was teaching journalism in Iran (she was on holiday). Now, even as Richard Ratcliffe hugs Gabriella and says: \u201cLet\u2019s hope that this homecoming unlocks another\u201d, there\u2019s the sense of an ordinary woman suspended helplessly in a geopolitical web that\u2019s more tangled by the second. Meanwhile, in August, 19-year-old Harry Dunn was riding his motorbike near RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire when he was killed after colliding with a car allegedly driven by US diplomat\u2019s wife Anne Sacoolas, who then returned to America, claiming diplomatic immunity. Johnson requested that she return to Britain for questioning. However, Donald Trump\u2019s briefing notes were spotted at a press conference, saying that Sacoolas would not be returning. Not that Trump used these notes, preferring to ad-lib about how Americans sometimes drove on the wrong side of the road in Britain (\u201cit happens\u201d) and how they would \u201csee what we can come up with, so there can be some healing\u201d. Marvellous. Perhaps he is thinking of sending the Dunn family some crystals? Denouncing Trump\u2019s attitude as \u201coafish\u201d, the Dunns also called foreign secretary Dominic Raab\u2019s handling of their case \u201ccold and strange\u201d. Again, there\u2019s the sense of ordinary people trapped in a grotesque web, reliant on British representatives rendered powerless. Of course, these are two very different situations with no simple solutions. What they have in common is that both families have suffered appallingly, with Johnson\u2019s inadequacy placed centre stage. First, there was his fudging of the Zaghari-Ratcliffe case; now his supposed special relationship with Trump vanishes at the first sign of trouble. It wasn\u2019t even that Trump couldn\u2019t help \u2013 rather, that he couldn\u2019t care less about not helping, not even bothering to read from prepared notes. This should ring alarm bells for our future. Whatever the hard facts and cold realities of these specific cases, a broader message keeps hitting home \u2013 Britain has never mattered less. There\u2019ll be hell to pay if goths can\u2019t haunt graveyards With Halloween imminent, the question must be asked \u2013 what are the ethics of goth-proofing a graveyard? There\u2019s tension in the Cotswolds, where the vicar of Britain\u2019s \u201cmost haunted\u201d village, Prestbury in Gloucestershire, has banned tour operator Cotswold Ghost Tours from hosting walks in the graveyard. One of the Rev Nick Bromfield\u2019s points is that he finds it unacceptable for hen parties and ghost hunters to be tramping through the graveyardabout, perhaps straying unwittingly close to new graves. However, I also feel sympathy for the tour operators trying to make the most of Prestbury\u2019s reputation, which includes tales of a ghostly horseman, hooves pounding for all eternity. Let\u2019s hope that a compromise can be reached. Vicars need to realise that graveyards often become chill-out zones for adolescents of the gloomier persuasion, wishing to gather to sip cheap, lukewarm alcohol from two-litre bottles and pretentiously discuss death. Yes, goths, and they have to go somewhere. This is why all clergy should think twice before taking the radical step of goth removal. If they\u2019re not careful, they could be forced into public areas, with their crimped hair, charity shop cravats and Strongbow bottles, and locals would soon be fondly reminiscing about when trick or treat happened just once a year. Streaming? Forget it \u2013 HMV is the only gig in town Good luck to the newly opened HMV \u201centertainment store\u201d in Birmingham, the biggest of its kind in Europe. Sunrise Records boss, Doug Putman, rescued 100 HMV stores in February and intends to defy online and streaming trends, offering 80,000 CDs and 25,000 vinyl albums in the Birmingham store, as well as film, TV, books, technology, merchandise and a stage for bands. Putman also promised that HMV would \u201cpay tax\u201d \u2013 take that, Amazon. Canadian Putman, a \u201cvinyl nut\u201d, seems to be the kind of customer he\u2019s trying to attract, which always helps. Certainly, he realises that it\u2019s key to create a sense of community among music lovers, making it not just about buying, but also about hanging out. For vinyl obsessives, this could also mean... vindication at last! A photo shows him grinning among the racks of vinyl and CDs, looking as though he\u2019s rummaging at an old-school record fair. As someone who, in her rock chick days, used to stagger and crunch in heels across a carpet of discarded records to get to the turntable, against a backdrop of horrified screams from more \u201cfastidious\u201d music lovers, I\u2019d be the first to admit this is not my world. However, Maybe I must belatedly concede that this is my loss. Vinyl and CD heads have always been easy to stereotype: still dressing in band tour T-shirts long into middle age; perhaps prone to becoming a little over-excited at the discovery of limited edition, picture-disc \u201cwaxings\u201d with original inner sleeves. However, the direction taken by HMV indicates that they were right all along. Their formats of choice have not only survived, they have prospered. Moreover, their tastes have evolved into a viable mainstream business model \u2013 not only evoking the past, but also the future, maybe even the saviour of high street rock\u2019n\u2019roll. \u2022 Barbara Ellen is an Observer columnist",

I guess I have to be clever with what I\u2019m doing but maybe I have to expect that someone is going to wind me up to get me suspended.\u201d The Wigan striker Kieffer Moore is expected to retain his place in the starting XI, while Giggs said he could freshen things up elsewhere. He will make late calls on Ethan Ampadu and Jonny Williams; both of whom started in Slovakia in midweek, though the pair took part in a light session on Saturday morning. \u201cThey are a fantastic team with brilliant individuals, but we are a good team as well,\u201d Giggs said. \u201cWe showed that on Thursday night but we need to be better and we need to do it for 90 minutes. Any mistakes, any lapses in concentration, you get punished at this top level against the top teams. It\u2019s not easy but we have got the players to do it and the players are ready.\u201d",

They\u2019ve had a lot of the ball and Darren\u2019s not made a save. It\u2019s a tough game and a good point, I believe. We\u2019ve proved already we\u2019re a hard nut to crack. </p> <p>I thought Connolly was excellent. He\u2019s not on that long but he\u2019s sharp, he got turned round. The one he got in I thought he was going to score and have a perfect debut. I felt we needed a presence up front which James collins gave us. He put a shift in. He didn\u2019t get many chances but he contributed to that 0-0, that\u2019s for sure. I thought, any goal was going to come from a free kick or a corner and that was probably us as well. And that nearly happened at the end. </p> <p>We\u2019re a point better off, we\u2019ll get ready for Switzerland and we\u2019ll try to beat them. Of course we know what a good team they are.

They\u2019re a good side and you have to be really on it to come here and get a result. But we kept a clean sheet and there\u2019s always a chance of winning the game when you keep a clean sheet, we just didn\u2019t take our half-chances. At the end, we probably finished the stronger.

But they could still flounder: their two remaining games after this one are against Switzerland (in Geneva on Tuesday) and at home to Denmark, the two other teams competing for final berths. Crucially however those two play in Copenhagen today, making this one final and fantastic opportunity for the Irish to put daylight between themselves and their pursuers. Today\u2019s results will not be definitive, but they could come close: should Ireland win today and Denmark lose, Mick McCarthy will know that a draw in his side\u2019s final home game, or a win in either of their final two fixtures, would be enough.</p> <p>But let\u2019s not get carried away. Ireland last visited Tbilisi just over two years ago, when they were held to a 1-1 draw in World Cup qualifying, and though they have beaten Georgia at home in this qualifying campaign and their last, on both occasions the score was 1-0. In Georgia\u2019s most recent qualifier, in Tbilisi last month, they held Denmark to a goalless draw. \u201cWe must play like we did against Denmark, but we need more quality in the attacking area,\u201d said Vladimir Weiss, their manager. \u201cWe hope we will score first, and for the first time in history I hope we can beat Ireland. But we must play at 120%, to play at 100% is not enough.\u201d</p> <p>The build-up has been illuminated by some entertaining dancing-related repartee between the managers, with Weiss saying that Ireland \u201cplay with phenomenal energy, just like Michael Flatley dances. There are good dancers in Georgia too, but he\u2019s very special.\u201d When McCarthy was told about this assessment he paused to think for a while before settling on being very pleased. \u201cWhen someone describes you as someone who is as brilliant as Michael Flatley, such a wonderful performer and dancer, and a good guy, actually, I\u2019ll take that as a huge compliment of my team,\u201d he beamed.</p> <p>So once they lace up their boots, will Ireland turn out to be more Michael Flatley or Ed Balls* today? We\u2019re about to find out! Well, in an hour or so anyway. Until then, welcome! </p> <p>* More recent dancing-related comparisons unavailable due to ignorance.</p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "Right, that\u2019s all from me. A couple of extra points here would have come in handy for the Republic, but \u2019twas not to be. Bye! Here\u2019s a match report: And now, Mick McCarthy: I\u2019m happy. It\u2019s a point. If somebody had said to me at the start when we were playing Georgia we\u2019d get four points off them, I think I\u2019d have took that. They\u2019ve had a lot of the ball and Darren\u2019s not made a save. It\u2019s a tough game and a good point, I believe. We\u2019ve proved already we\u2019re a hard nut to crack. I thought Connolly was excellent. He\u2019s not on that long but he\u2019s sharp, he got turned round. The one he got in I thought he was going to score and have a perfect debut. I felt we needed a presence up front which James collins gave us. He put a shift in. He didn\u2019t get many chances but he contributed to that 0-0, that\u2019s for sure. I thought, any goal was going to come from a free kick or a corner and that was probably us as well. And that nearly happened at the end. We\u2019re a point better off, we\u2019ll get ready for Switzerland and we\u2019ll try to beat them. Of course we know what a good team they are. Of course it might all hinge on the Denmark game at home, but we\u2019ll try to take care of Switzerland first. Here\u2019s John Egan: Unfortunately hit the post and popped out. I think if we\u2019d nicked an early goal we\u2019d have been very hard to break down. It wasn\u2019t to be but we dug deep and had a couple of opportunities and could have nicked it in the end. They\u2019re a good side and you have to be really on it to come here and get a result. But we kept a clean sheet and there\u2019s always a chance of winning the game when you keep a clean sheet, we just didn\u2019t take our half-chances. At the end, we probably finished the stronger. The longer it went on you could feel there might be one more chance. Unfortunately we didn\u2019t take it. Ireland could have done with a bit more pace, or height, or quality in attack. With none of those, goals are going to be hard to find, and with McClean sub-par and Collins invisible they struggled. Connolly came on with 10 minutes to play, and did well enough to make Mick McCarthy look silly for waiting so long, but not well enough to actually score. Ireland\u2019s debutant Aaron Connolly has a chat: It\u2019s definitely up there with my proudest moments in football so far, it\u2019s just gutting we didn\u2019t get the goal. As a striker when you get in those situations you have to score. I just tried to come on and maybe change the game a little bit. I\u2019ve got two chances, probably should have put one of them away. It\u2019s a bit disappointing I didn\u2019t, but overall it was a good performance. We could have won, could have lost at the end of the day. We\u2019ve got a big game on Tuesday. Get three points there and everyone says this is a good point. The bad news: The Republic of Ireland missed out on a chance to take control of the group and of their destiny. The good news: It\u2019s over. So there were three shots on target in the entire game, one of which nobody noticed, and two of which happened in the 90th minute or later. 90+5 mins: And that\u2019s it! 90+5 mins: Save! Duffy gets his head to the ball but it deflects off a defender and straight to Loria, who is standing in the middle of the goal. 90+4 mins: Ireland win a corner! Jeff Hendrick runs across to take it. Can they conjure some last-minute magic? 90+4 mins: Into the last minute of advertised stoppage time. 90+2 mins: An actual chance! The ball is booted forward by Whelan and Connolly is running through from halfway! With two defenders to his right he can\u2019t really cut inside, so he lashes it wide with his left foot! 90 mins: That\u2019s a shot on target, no doubt about it! McClean sets it up for Connolly, whose first-time left-footer is pretty easily saved by Loria. That\u2019s the best moment of the match by far. And, just to be clear, it\u2019s a rubbish moment. 89 mins: Kakabadze cuts inside and hits a 25-yarder way over the bar with his left foot. Georgia bring on Giorgi Aburjania, and take off Kiteishvili. 88 mins: The referee has the yellowest whistle I\u2019ve ever seen. Ireland win (well, are given) the ball just outside their area and as they try to break Gia Grigalava just starts running into people in an attempt to stop them and give away a free kick instead. Eventually he succeeds, and gets booked for his cynicism. 86 mins: Whelan tries to pick out Connolly, but falls over mid-pass. 83 mins: A chance! Lobjanidze runs with the ball into the area after a defensive mix-up, but is so astonished to be inside the penalty area with the ball and in space that he suffers a massive brainfade and passes to an Irishman. 81 mins: It\u2019s a rubbish corner, headed clear at the near post. The ball is sent back into the box, but straight to Randolph. 80 mins: Kiteishvili has a shot from 40 yards, because why not? It deflects off Browne, and Georgia have another corner. 79 mins: Georgia take off Okriashvili, and bring on Elguja Lobjanidze. 78 mins: Another Georgian player is on the floor. It\u2019s Okriashvili, who needs some treatment. Ireland take the opportunity to bring Aaron Connolly on for Collins. 76 mins: Something! McClean\u2019s cross from the left is headed to Hendrick, on the right side of the penalty area, whose shot hits the side netting! 75 mins: \u201cI think this is one of the very very worst games of football I\u2019ve seen in a long time,\u201d says Anthony O\u2019Connell, as Duffy goes on a great run from the edge of his area to the halfway line before overhitting his pass. \u201cWe need to bring Connolly on and two others and just shake it up. We can actually string three passes together. Awful from Ireland, truly awful.\u201d 73 mins: Substitutions! Ireland take off Robinson and bring on Alan Browne. Georgia take off Kvilitaia and bring on Levan Shengelia. 69 mins: According to Uefa\u2019s match statistics Ireland have had a shot on target. I\u2019m not entirely sure when. I must have lost consciousness for a moment. It must have been Hendrick\u2019s header at the start of this half, though given that it was straight at the goalkeeper, from a foot away from the goalkeeper, and from well wide of goal I don\u2019t think it should count. 66 mins: Ananidze gets up, brushes himself down and lifts the free kick over the wall, and also the goal. 65 mins: A yellow card! Ananidze is fouled by Whelan \u2013 actually he\u2019s more just run into \u2013 and the Irishman is in the book! Incredible scenes! And, also, a dangerous free kick. 62 mins: Georgia hit the ball forwards. It bounces out of play. Randolph takes a goal kick. It goes out for a throw-in. 58 mins: Nothing much has changed since half time, sadly. 55 mins: Tabidze wins the cynical trip of the day award, bringing down Hendrick for no obvious reason or tactical advantage. \u201cI\u2019m having a pretty chill morning in western Canada watching the game while drinking some coffee with ABV additive,\u201d writes Travis Giblin. \u201cI have to say, at least the coffee is helping keep me awake because this game has been a snoozefest so far.\u201d Indeed, it could be described as edge-of-your-seat entertainment only because viewers might be preparing to get up and turn the TV off. 53 mins: The ball is half-cleared to Kiteishvili, who runs onto it as it bounces and powers a header goalwards. Kvilitaia is in the way, though, and he not only deflects it over the bar, he does so with his arm. 52 mins: Ananidze\u2019s free-kick is headed wide by a defender, leading to Georgia\u2019s first corner of the game, which leads to their second corner of the game. 51 mins: Kakabadze is not only back on the pitch, but he crosses the ball from the right. The biggest problem with this game is that Ireland are much better at heading than Georgia are at crossing. 48 mins: After very brief treatment he hops up and half-limps to the touchline. It looks like he\u2019ll be able to continue. 48 mins: Otar Kakabadze, the Georgia defender, goes down, with nobody anywhere near him. 46 mins: The encouraging sight of a flapping goalkeeper! McClean crosses from the left, and Loria forgets how to catch. He recovers to block Hendrick\u2019s header, though. 46 mins: Peeeeep! Ireland start half two. The players come back out. Can anyone grab the goal that would transform this game? We\u2019re about to find out! There have been seven goal attempts in all, five from the home side. Not one has been on target. 45+1 mins: That\u2019s all for now. For most of the half Georgia were about to threaten, but they never actually got around to threatening. Neither did Ireland, that early post-strike excepted. The only way is up. 45+1 mins: Into stoppage time, of which there\u2019ll be a minute or so. 45 mins: Egan wins the header and sends it goalwards, but the referee spots some pushing in the box and blows his whistle, and anyway Loria saved easily enough. 44 mins: Another Ireland corner is about to happen. Set pieces look very much like their best chance. 42 mins: Ireland win a corner but it\u2019s not a good one, Georgia break and at the end of it Qazaishvili sends a shot from outside the area zipping wide. 41 mins: This game has goalless draw written all over it in big block capitals. Still, we live in hope. 40 mins: Okriashvili is cleanly tackled, but falls over and wins a free-kick anyway. Happily, Georgia do nothing with it. 38 mins: \u201cThere was a time when international team sheets had club names alongside each player. Not only is this necessary for the Georgia team but increasingly so for the Ireland squad,\u201d sniffs, um, someone who doesn\u2019t give me their name. Yeah, those were the days. If you do want to know more about the players, you can find some useful information here. 35 mins: Ireland threaten! Robinson crosses from the right, but McClean can\u2019t quite reach it as it bounces across goal! 33 mins: The Republic win the ball but make a hash of clearing, Whelan testing Randolph with a slightly troublesome back-pass, and Randolph then mishitting his clearance along the ground and straight into trouble. They get away with it. 30 mins: Qazaishvili twinkles on the left but fails to find space to cross, then gets it back, tries again and fails again. Georgia eventually give up on the whole crossing thing and pass the ball all the way back to their defence. 27 mins: Doherty storms down the left, cuts inside, gets to the byline, but he has no confidence in his left foot and in contorting himself to centre with his right he lets the ball run out of play. 25 mins: Ireland have fought their way into this game, keeping play inside the central third for a while. When Georgia do push forward, Ireland once again intercept, clear and win a free kick, Hourihane being fouled by Kiteishvili. 22 mins: \u201cIs it just me, or does this match seem to be going in slow motion?\u201d asks Joe Pearson. \u201cOh, and the pitch looks dreadful.\u201d I think it might just be you, though Georgia certainly favour an approach that could be called either patient or boring, depending on your outlook. The pitch is a bit bobbly, though. 20 mins: Nine players back (plus the keeper, so 10 really) for the Irish as Georgia threaten, but the home side can\u2019t find a way through. 18 mins: Ireland have the ball, and keep it for a little while. The home fans whistle in fury. 17 mins: Okriashvili ignores a couple of well-placed team-mates in favour of attempting an impossible shot, which goes wide. Georgia have had 66% of possession so far. \u201cMichael Flatley? No sir, I\u2019m not having that comparison. Like the boxer Bernard Hopkins said, I\u2019d rather be compared to Mary Poppins,\u201d insists JR. \u201cAnd somebody should tell ol\u2019 Vlad that Flatley\u2019s not even Irish. He\u2019s from not far from where I am, the south side of Chicago!\u201d 15 mins: Never mind Lord of the Dance, the Republic are very much playing second fiddle here. Still, they nearly scored from their only attacking free-kick, so there\u2019s some promise there. 13 mins: Another attack from the home side, but this time when the ball is chipped into the box Okriashvili theatrically throws himself to the turf, and is rightly ignored by the referee. 12 mins: Chance for Georgia! The ball is laid back to Ananidze, just outside the Republic\u2019s penalty area, who has time to measure his shot but fluffs his calculations and scuffs it wide. 10 mins: Georgia attack down the right again, but this time the cross is low and Glenn Whelan is well placed to intercept and clear. Again, Ireland then win a free kick in their own half and can relax a bit. 7 mins: Georgia work a fine attack, keeping possession well, moving the ball, bringing numbers forward, but when they eventually cross from the right it\u2019s headed clear, and Collins wins a free kick just outside the area. 4 mins: Ireland hit the post! They win a free kick on the left flank, which Hourihane sends into the area. Egan does well to win the header and glance it across goal, but with the goalkeeper a spectator it hits the meat of the post and rebounds to a defender who clears! 1 mins: The first shot of the day comes off the right boot of Qazaishvili, who from 15 yards or so lashes the ball well wide of goal. 1 min: And they\u2019re off! The home side get the game going. Anthems over, we\u2019re about to get some football. There is some absolutely horrible anthem-singing from the Georgian players. I\u2019m not sure who the microphone was pointing at at the start, but the noise coming out of his mouth is unforgivable. And out they come! Judging by the number of green-shirted supporters shielding their eyes, the away end has got the worst of the setting sun. The players are in the tunnel, with kick-off just a few minutes away. Looks like a lovely day in Tbilisi. The picture wires are full of pictures of people in T-shirts. Well, Irish fans in T-shirts and locals in jumpers. Still, blue skies at least. Mick McCarthy has a chat, firstly about James Collins: He\u2019s come up into the Championship this year, he\u2019s playing well and scoring goals and I thought he made the difference when he came on against Bulgaria. Players who sit on the bench and travel around when they get a chance they have to take it, and he did that. On his back four, and Doherty at left-back: He\u2019s done fine. I\u2019ve asked him when we\u2019ve trained, just go and play at left-back. He\u2019s one of the best wing-backs over the last two or three years, he\u2019s played left-back for one and a half seasons with Wolves before. I think if you\u2019d asked him, he\u2019d rather be there than not involved. I want to perform like we did against them in Dublin. That\u2019s to get the first and stop them playing, and when we have it to be comfortable in possession and try and pin them back. I\u2019d like to come off thinking we\u2019d been equal in possession. Ken Early\u2019s match preview for the Irish Times is excellent. It\u2019s here, and worth a click. The teams in full, then: Georgia: Loria, Kakabadze, Kashia, Tabidze, Grigalava, Kankava, Kiteishvili, Okriashvili, Ananidze, Qazaishvili, Kvilitaia. Subs: Elguja Lobjanidze, Shengelia, Makaridze, Saba Lobjanidze, Navalovski, Kharaishvili, Aburjania, Daushvili, Khotcholava, Kupatadze, Kvirkvelia. Republic of Ireland: Randolph, Coleman, Duffy, Egan, Doherty, Whelan, Hourihane, Robinson, Hendrick, McClean, Collins. Subs: Long, Browne, Connolly, Cullen, Byrne, Williams, O\u2019Hara, O\u2019Dowda, Maguire, Hogan, Travers, Judge. Referee: Marco Guida (Italy). Here\u2019s the Georgia team, in two alphabets. They make one change to the team that drew with Denmark, Jaba Kankava replacing Giorgi Aburjania in midfield: Team news! James Collins makes his competitive debut for the Republic of Ireland, replacing the injured David McGoldrick, in one of three changes from last month\u2019s friendly win over Bulgaria. Matt Doherty replaces the suspended Enda Stevens at left-back and John Egan moves into central defence. Hello world! Top of the group by two points, unbeaten in five games, the Republic of Ireland\u2019s qualifying campaign is going swimmingly. But they could still flounder: their two remaining games after this one are against Switzerland (in Geneva on Tuesday) and at home to Denmark, the two other teams competing for final berths. Crucially however those two play in Copenhagen today, making this one final and fantastic opportunity for the Irish to put daylight between themselves and their pursuers. Today\u2019s results will not be definitive, but they could come close: should Ireland win today and Denmark lose, Mick McCarthy will know that a draw in his side\u2019s final home game, or a win in either of their final two fixtures, would be enough. But let\u2019s not get carried away. Ireland last visited Tbilisi just over two years ago, when they were held to a 1-1 draw in World Cup qualifying, and though they have beaten Georgia at home in this qualifying campaign and their last, on both occasions the score was 1-0. In Georgia\u2019s most recent qualifier, in Tbilisi last month, they held Denmark to a goalless draw. \u201cWe must play like we did against Denmark, but we need more quality in the attacking area,\u201d said Vladimir Weiss, their manager. \u201cWe hope we will score first, and for the first time in history I hope we can beat Ireland. But we must play at 120%, to play at 100% is not enough.\u201d The build-up has been illuminated by some entertaining dancing-related repartee between the managers, with Weiss saying that Ireland \u201cplay with phenomenal energy, just like Michael Flatley dances. There are good dancers in Georgia too, but he\u2019s very special.\u201d When McCarthy was told about this assessment he paused to think for a while before settling on being very pleased. \u201cWhen someone describes you as someone who is as brilliant as Michael Flatley, such a wonderful performer and dancer, and a good guy, actually, I\u2019ll take that as a huge compliment of my team,\u201d he beamed. So once they lace up their boots, will Ireland turn out to be more Michael Flatley or Ed Balls* today? We\u2019re about to find out! Well, in an hour or so anyway. Until then, welcome! * More recent dancing-related comparisons unavailable due to ignorance.",

And then there are the people who don\u2019t identify as women, because they are transgender or gender non-conforming, but experience menopause nonetheless.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The world\u2019s finance ministers and central bankers will be in Washington this week for the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank amid growing concerns that the global economy is heading towards stagnation. Predictions of a sharp downturn fill policymakers with anxiety, knowing that job losses and lower tax revenues can only lead to social unrest. Last week the IMF\u2019s new leader, Kristalina Georgieva, asked nations involved in tit-for-tat trade wars if they dare ignore warnings of the most serious threat to the global economy since the financial crisis. However, her agenda goes beyond the short-term difficulties posed by a downturn. Beginning her five-year tenure as managing director and chairwoman of the IMF\u2019s executive board, she said the organisation\u2019s long-term objectives included \u201cdealing with issues like inequalities, climate risks and rapid technological change.\u201d Georgieva, previously number two at the World Bank and a Bulgarian national, is known for her commitment to tackling the climate crisis after starting work in academia lecturing on development issues before securing a post at the World Bank as an environmental economist. The 66-year-old rose through the ranks to become vice-president and corporate secretary before in 2010 accepting the nomination of the Bulgarian government to be an EU commissioner. She was responsible for humanitarian aid and crisis management before a second term in 2014 as commissioner for international cooperation and development. As the IMF celebrates its 75th anniversary, finding a way to ally policies to tackle climate change with plans for broad-based GDP growth in the developing world while also closing inequality gaps is not going to be easy. Privately, Georgieva has said the IMF is playing catch-up after years when it paid lip service to environmental concerns. It focused on economic growth based on free and open trade and not much more. The bread-and-butter business of providing loans to indebted countries is commonly tied to labour reforms and privatisations that benefit owners over workers. Kenneth Rogoff, the IMF\u2019s chief economist from 2001 to 2003, said: \u201cThe organisation is funded as a lending agency and not an aid agency, a simple fact that many [anti-poverty campaigners] do not seem to understand. Moreover, unlike the World Bank, which makes long-term subsidised development loans, the IMF is the one tasked with helping countries hit by financial crises regain access to private credit markets.\u201d Rogoff said the IMF would need to retain its tough stance when it offered loans, arguing that Georgieva would be better advised to find other agencies to increase aid to indebted countries. This week Georgieva will lead discussions on how to implement huge rises in carbon taxes, including on the consumption of petrol, diesel, oil and gas. This policy lacks a road map for governments that shows how they move away from an economy dependent on carbon to one that is almost carbon-free, according to critics of the bank. In the first major discussion paper since Georgieva\u2019s arrival, the IMF said global heating would require governments around the world to impose stringent taxes on fossil-fuel usage that would mean a 43% jump in household energy bills over the next decade. Ecuador is the latest country to raise the duty on domestic fuel and petrol only to be met with angry protests. Fuel subsidy cuts, announced of part of a $4.2bn austerity plan with the IMF, triggered days of riots, forcing the government to leave the capital, Quito. Economist Brunello Rosa, co-founder, with New York-based economist Nouriel Roubini, of Rosa &amp; Roubini Associates, an independent consultancy firm, said Georgieva would find rises in fuel duty to cut carbon emissions would prove difficult. \u201cIt is not just going to be Ecuador where we see riots.

If the IMF is to tackle inequality, Georgieva will need to turn the steering wheel almost as hard as she must on the environment.

The charity Jubilee Debt 2000, which campaigns against austerity and in favour of debt forgiveness for poor countries, says Georgieva should review IMF support for countries devastated by typhoons, tsunami\u2019s and earthquakes. Mozambique was dealing with a $2bn loans scandal and a persistent government deficit when it suffered huge damage from Cyclone Idai. The IMF has provided more than $100m in short-term loans that will be almost impossible to pay back without crippling public services or the recovery effort, say campaigners. Georgieva, who studied at the Karl Marx Institute of Economics in Sofia, must also work to show the IMF is more inclusive. The Nobel prizewinning economist and former World Bank chief economist Joseph Stiglitz has criticised its dominance by finance ministers and central bank governors.

What we wanted to do was keep some of that love in the house.\u201d</p> <p>They bought the house in 2016 and enlisted the help of their friends, Sonya Flynn and Mark Baker, founders of the local architecture firm <a href=\"https://www.memearchitects.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Meme</a>. \u201cWe sat in their garden and talked about what the house could become. They listened to us so carefully. They knew us and how we wanted to live and the first design they had is pretty much what we\u2019re sitting in now.\u201d A year later, work began.</p> <p>The house has been completely remodelled with extensions to the front and rear. The exterior is clad in dark render with black timber fins at ground-floor level, and expansive glazing and balconies on the first floor that maximise the views of the sea and sky. The architects have kept the original pitch of the roof, opening up the loft space and inserting two glass triangles into the roof gable. Dark and \u201cstealth-like\u201d on the outside, the interior is full of light and blocks of bold colour.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5079acf146e456ddad39954e85b6396812779303\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5079acf146e456ddad39954e85b6396812779303/0_189_5679_3407/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Partition walls, slats and sliding doors create separate areas in which to \u2018hide\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Open spaces: partition walls, slats and sliding doors create separate areas in which to \u2018hide\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jo Bridges/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mel, a former deputy headteacher, made all the colour choices, starting with the pink, green and gold kitchen by <a href=\"http://rochlinbespoke.com/\" title=\"\">Rochlin Bespoke</a>.

The architects, joiners and the kitchen company are all from the area.

Upstairs, there\u2019s a library and workspace for the children. The house has also been future-proofed for family life, Mel explains.</p> <p>The downstairs guest room and family snug will eventually become Gus\u2019s bedroom and front room, should he decide to live with them as an adult.

Built in the 1970s, it was being sold by the family of the couple who had built it. \u201cThat family are still local,\u201d says Mel. \u201cThey\u2019d obviously lived here so happily. What we wanted to do was keep some of that love in the house.\u201d They bought the house in 2016 and enlisted the help of their friends, Sonya Flynn and Mark Baker, founders of the local architecture firm Meme. \u201cWe sat in their garden and talked about what the house could become. They listened to us so carefully. They knew us and how we wanted to live and the first design they had is pretty much what we\u2019re sitting in now.\u201d A year later, work began. The house has been completely remodelled with extensions to the front and rear. The exterior is clad in dark render with black timber fins at ground-floor level, and expansive glazing and balconies on the first floor that maximise the views of the sea and sky. The architects have kept the original pitch of the roof, opening up the loft space and inserting two glass triangles into the roof gable. Dark and \u201cstealth-like\u201d on the outside, the interior is full of light and blocks of bold colour. Mel, a former deputy headteacher, made all the colour choices, starting with the pink, green and gold kitchen by Rochlin Bespoke. Dark greys and navy blues are counterpointed with rooms in yellow, mint green and peach (\u201cStraight out of my 80s bedroom\u201d). Bespoke, brass-trimmed cabinetry features throughout the house, while furniture is a combination of high-street and high-end: rattan Ikea rockers for the kids, Fritz Hansen easy chairs for the grown-ups. Where possible, the couple have spent much of their budget locally. The architects, joiners and the kitchen company are all from the area. Even the main contractor was a dad from the twins\u2019 school. \u201cWe felt that was really important,\u201d explains Mel. \u201cYou don\u2019t expect it, but it did mean we got such personal touches.\u201d The floorplan is cleverly divided into generous day spaces (there is a 6m opening from the kitchen-dining area to the rear, south-facing garden) and cosier, more reclusive areas: there\u2019s a playroom on the ground floor, a family snug off the kitchen where the kids can lie on the floor and watch telly. Upstairs, there\u2019s a library and workspace for the children. The house has also been future-proofed for family life, Mel explains. The downstairs guest room and family snug will eventually become Gus\u2019s bedroom and front room, should he decide to live with them as an adult. If he wants more independence, there is a studio space at the end of the garden, which they could convert. The design-and-build process took two years from start to finish. Six weeks after completion, Mel was still finding spurious reasons to call the builders back in. \u201cI got really upset when the work finished, because the buzz had gone and the people had gone.\u201d In the end, she held a party to thank everyone for their input on the project. \u201cI got real energy from it,\u201d she remembers. \u201cNothing was a bind and I never felt stressed: I just loved every part of the process. And now we get to live in it!\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The Windrush generation has been much in the news \u2013 and rightly so \u2013 since the scandal of the threatened and actual deportation of hundreds of them by the Home Office came to light last year. Numerous poignant and moving photographs of the original pioneers have been published, too, but few have packed the punch of Howard Grey\u2019s extraordinary, historic shots taken at Waterloo Station 57 years ago. It would be hard to find pictures more emblematic of the Windrush era than these, yet for over five decades they remained not only unseen but unprinted, tucked away in a drawer in the photographer\u2019s studio.</p> <p>It was early in 1962 when word spread in the Caribbean that the British were about to change the laws on immigration making it much more difficult for West Indians to come here to live and work. The news created a panic in the soon-to-be-former colonies and there was a surge of people hurrying to the UK before the Commonwealth Immigrants Act of that year was passed.</p> <p>When Grey heard reports one overcast, drizzly midweek day in May that passengers from apparently the last ship of West Indians were arriving on the boat train from Southampton to Waterloo, the 20-year-old assistant photographer grabbed two cameras and headed straight to the station. Now 77, Grey has the energy of a much younger man, his eyes lambent and mischievous as we look through his archives together at his house in Clapham, south London. He recalls the great throng of West Indians, perhaps three or four hundred friends and relatives, waiting at Waterloo with heightened excitement for the train to come in. The arrivals have clearly ignored the advice of the BBC booklet of the time, <em>Going to Britain?</em> \u2013 which warns the West Indians: \u201cDo not put on your best clothes for landing\u201d \u2013 and are dressed to a point beyond distinction. All the images are vivid, dignified and tender, the people they capture full of hope and anxiety. The pictures reveal a degree of maturity unexpected from such a young photographer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"506dd2bc755c5f73f060a7e2a267f1f63d4c3f3b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/506dd2bc755c5f73f060a7e2a267f1f63d4c3f3b/0_0_1969_1407/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Women waiting for the train at Waterloo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"715\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The expectancy here is incredible.

He\u2019s a third-generation photographer, from a Jewish family who fled the pogroms in Russia and Ukraine on an onion boat and ended up in England via Tilbury.</p> <p>Looking back now, Grey believes he had an affinity with the West Indians because of his own family history. \u201cThe West Indians\u2019 arrival conjured for me the last boat out of Odessa for my grandparents, not as dramatic as that, of course.

Whole families were there to greet them, dressed in their Sunday best.\u201d Grey was thrilled that no other photographers had bothered to show up but his excitement was tempered by the weather and poor light. \u201cIt was one of those gloomy days, and the station was very dark. Its glass roof was still yellow from the grease and smoke screens of the second world war; then you had the black asphalt on the platform, and of course the West Indians had dark skin.\u201d</p> <p>Grey hated flash photography so was reluctant to use a flash gun. \u201cI had an exposure meter reading that was dire and I knew I was in trouble.\u201d He shot quickly and instinctively, going through three rolls of film in 20 minutes. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t much forethought. I wasn\u2019t framing a narrative. I just took pictures believing every one was a possible jewel.\u201d Traipsing home in the rain, Grey was pessimistic, and in the darkroom his fears were realised. \u201cEven when I pushed it, doubling the development time to work on the shadow areas of the negative, there was nothing printable there.\u201d</p> <p>He put away the negatives in a manila envelope and over subsequent decades went on to forge a successful career as an advertising photographer. Occasionally he\u2019d reflect on the undeveloped West Indian photos but was ultimately phlegmatic. \u201cI\u2019d seen their potential and had taken the pictures but it had failed. There was nothing I could do. It was just a pity.\u201d</p> <p>More than 50 years passed and then one day in 2014 with the advent of digital cameras and scanners, Grey watched a TV programme about how new technology had revealed layers of text hidden beneath the surface of an ancient manuscript on vellum. He recalled one of his father\u2019s sayings: \u201cThe detail is always there, even if you can\u2019t see it at first.\u201d He dug out the Waterloo negatives, and put them under high-definition scanners, \u201cone scan for the shadows, one for the highlights and another for the mid tones. And then I brought them together, layered over each other; and up they came, the images I\u2019d never seen! I was freaked. I couldn\u2019t believe it. I saw the human drama of 1962 right there. I was revisiting the past and was absolutely astounded. I didn\u2019t run around shouting \u201cEureka\u201d down Clapham High Street but as good as\u2026 It was alchemy.

      "body": "<p>Last Monday was a significant anniversary in the evolution of the web. It was 25 years to the day since the first serious blog appeared. It was called <a href=\"http://scripting.com/\" title=\"\">Scripting News</a> and the url was (and remains) at scripting.com. Its author is a software wizard named Dave Winer, who\u2019s updated it every day since 1994. And despite its wide readership, it has never run ads. This may be partly because Dave doesn\u2019t need the money (he sold his company to Symantec in 1987 for a substantial sum) but it\u2019s mainly because he didn\u2019t want to compete for the attention of his readers. \u201cI see running ads on my blog,\u201d he <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2015/09/20/whyIveNeverRunAdsOnScriptingNews.html\" title=\"\">once wrote</a>, \u201cas picking up loose change that\u2019s fallen out of peoples\u2019 pockets. I want to hit a home run. I\u2019m swinging for the fences. Not picking up litter.\u201d</p> <p>When some innovators cash out big, as Winer did, they more or less retire \u2013 play golf, buy a yacht and generally hang out in luxury. Not so Dave. He has a long string of innovations to his name, including <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliner\" title=\"\">outliner</a> and blogging software, RSS syndication, the outline processor markup language OPML and podcasting, of which he was a pioneer.</p> <p>And his daily blog at scripting.com continues to be a must-read for anyone interested in the intersection between technology and politics. Winer has a quirky, perceptive, liberal and sometimes contrarian take on just about anything that appears on his radar.

      "bodyText": "Last Monday was a significant anniversary in the evolution of the web. It was 25 years to the day since the first serious blog appeared. It was called Scripting News and the url was (and remains) at scripting.com. Its author is a software wizard named Dave Winer, who\u2019s updated it every day since 1994. And despite its wide readership, it has never run ads. This may be partly because Dave doesn\u2019t need the money (he sold his company to Symantec in 1987 for a substantial sum) but it\u2019s mainly because he didn\u2019t want to compete for the attention of his readers. \u201cI see running ads on my blog,\u201d he once wrote, \u201cas picking up loose change that\u2019s fallen out of peoples\u2019 pockets. I want to hit a home run. I\u2019m swinging for the fences. Not picking up litter.\u201d When some innovators cash out big, as Winer did, they more or less retire \u2013 play golf, buy a yacht and generally hang out in luxury. Not so Dave. He has a long string of innovations to his name, including outliner and blogging software, RSS syndication, the outline processor markup language OPML and podcasting, of which he was a pioneer. And his daily blog at scripting.com continues to be a must-read for anyone interested in the intersection between technology and politics. Winer has a quirky, perceptive, liberal and sometimes contrarian take on just about anything that appears on his radar. He is the nearest thing the web has to an international treasure. He\u2019s also a reminder of the importance of blogging, a phenomenon that has been overshadowed as social media exploded and sucked much of the oxygen out of our information environment. When Winer started, blogging was an elite activity: you had to know how to set up a website and publish to it.

Osamor, who served in the shadow cabinet until resigning last year, is on the left of the party and a staunch supporter of Jeremy Corbyn. It is unclear why the action has been taken against her, though party sources said there had been some local discontent that she had secured the seat ahead of other candidates. There is concern among MPs that women are more likely to face deselection threats. However, Labour has rebutted such concerns as unfounded, saying only a small number of MPs have fallen victim to trigger ballots. Diana Johnson, the Kingston upon Hull North MP, and Margaret Hodge, the Barking MP, have both had their seats being contested by \u201ctrigger ballots\u201d put forward by local parties, which means they will have to convince members they should stay on as their MP, after being challenged by a shortlist of other candidates. Emma Lewell-Buck, the South Shields MP, has also faced pressure from local members while Louise Ellman, who is Jewish and the MP for Liverpool Riverside, has faced calls to resign. Roger Godsiff, the MP for Birmingham Hall Green, is the only man to face a deselection battle so far. Lewell-Buck has said she is facing pressure because she is not \u201cthe chosen man\u201d. She added: \u201cWomen in politics always have a tough job, but I think there\u2019s particular areas where there\u2019s been a longstanding culture of misogyny, and something the Labour party centrally has been unable to get to the bottom of in South Shields.\u201d There were also concerns that MPs on the right of the party would be ousted for disloyalty to Corbyn, following the rule changes that made removing them easier. However, prominent opponents of Corbyn have already survived the process. Osamor resigned from Corbyn\u2019s shadow cabinet after suggestions she had misled the public over her son\u2019s drug conviction. He was handed a community sentence after being caught with drugs worth \u00a32,500 at Bestival in Dorset last year.",

She\u2019s got lovely twinkly eyes and she\u2019s made it OK for grans everywhere to love lesbians, if they\u2019re like Ellen and are nice and do dancing. Last week, the comedian and talkshow host used a segment of her show to perform a four-minute monologue on the importance of being friends with people whose views do not always resemble our own, especially when it comes to awkward topics such as war crimes.</p> <p>She was moved to sermonise on this topic after being criticised on Twitter. While watching the Dallas Cowboys, <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/10/ellen-degeneres-george-w-bush-football-game\" title=\"\">she was photographed laughing along with the man sitting next to her, who happened to be George W Bush</a>. \u201cPeople were upset,\u201d she explained. \u201cThey thought, why is a gay Hollywood liberal sitting next to a conservative Republican president?\u201d Nobody pointed out the obvious \u2013 \u201cbecause you\u2019re both so rich and powerful that the team\u2019s owner invited you\u201d \u2013 but nobody shouted: \u201cGuant\u00e1nam-oh no she didn\u2019t\u201d either, so opportunities were missed.</p> <p>The monologue continued to paint this friendship as some kind of breaking down of barriers. She went so far as to quote one person who declared that it \u201cmakes me have faith in America again\u201d. She explained that she and Bush were friends. The audience cheered. For this barnstorming defence of pleasantries sans frontieres, she won the giddy back-slapping support of other celebrities, with the notable exception of Mark Ruffalo, the Hulk, who in my eyes really earned his status as a superhero.</p> <p>If DeGeneres can be friends with a man who was active in his support for Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s appointment to the supreme court, who <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/24/politics/bush-backs-ban-in-constitution-on-gay-marriage.html\" title=\"\">in 2004 called for a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage</a>, whose sole redeeming quality is that he is not Donald Trump, then that is quite something. To be friends with a man whose legacy is one of war, torture and death on an unimaginable scale means her capacity for niceness is not so much bridging the gap as it is pathologically uncritical.</p> <p>Of course we need people who don\u2019t agree with our every belief and opinion, now, more than ever, but that is a separate point entirely. This is not like having a heated debate with a relative about Brexit, nor is it right to use it as a teachable moment, a symbol of what can be achieved when we\u2019re all civil to each other. Her ability to see the good in Bush is far from an act of moral superiority and to claim otherwise is, at best, wilfully naive. If we\u2019re being nice about it.</p> <h2>Stormzy: who says that grime doesn\u2019t pay?<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"78f0659f518abaef2f73df5d5dc4642a9259e2f2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/78f0659f518abaef2f73df5d5dc4642a9259e2f2/0_17_2146_1288/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stormzy at Glastonbury in 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stormzy at Glastonbury in 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Isaac/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If being on the cover of <em>Time</em> magazine was ever devalued by the knowledge that Donald Trump simply mocked up a favourable one with which to decorate some of his golf courses (with the gripping and punctuationally-challenged headline <em>The Apprentice </em>is a television smash!\u201d), like a Moonpig birthday card, then Stormzy has arrived to make sure everyone knows that it matters again.

The numbers are still impossibly small, but it is an improvement \u2013 91 black students were admitted, up from 61 in 2018.

      "bodyText": "Ellen DeGeneres is nice, isn\u2019t she? She dances funny. She\u2019s got lovely twinkly eyes and she\u2019s made it OK for grans everywhere to love lesbians, if they\u2019re like Ellen and are nice and do dancing. Last week, the comedian and talkshow host used a segment of her show to perform a four-minute monologue on the importance of being friends with people whose views do not always resemble our own, especially when it comes to awkward topics such as war crimes. She was moved to sermonise on this topic after being criticised on Twitter. While watching the Dallas Cowboys, she was photographed laughing along with the man sitting next to her, who happened to be George W Bush. \u201cPeople were upset,\u201d she explained. \u201cThey thought, why is a gay Hollywood liberal sitting next to a conservative Republican president?\u201d Nobody pointed out the obvious \u2013 \u201cbecause you\u2019re both so rich and powerful that the team\u2019s owner invited you\u201d \u2013 but nobody shouted: \u201cGuant\u00e1nam-oh no she didn\u2019t\u201d either, so opportunities were missed. The monologue continued to paint this friendship as some kind of breaking down of barriers. She went so far as to quote one person who declared that it \u201cmakes me have faith in America again\u201d. She explained that she and Bush were friends. The audience cheered. For this barnstorming defence of pleasantries sans frontieres, she won the giddy back-slapping support of other celebrities, with the notable exception of Mark Ruffalo, the Hulk, who in my eyes really earned his status as a superhero. If DeGeneres can be friends with a man who was active in his support for Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s appointment to the supreme court, who in 2004 called for a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage, whose sole redeeming quality is that he is not Donald Trump, then that is quite something. To be friends with a man whose legacy is one of war, torture and death on an unimaginable scale means her capacity for niceness is not so much bridging the gap as it is pathologically uncritical. Of course we need people who don\u2019t agree with our every belief and opinion, now, more than ever, but that is a separate point entirely. This is not like having a heated debate with a relative about Brexit, nor is it right to use it as a teachable moment, a symbol of what can be achieved when we\u2019re all civil to each other. Her ability to see the good in Bush is far from an act of moral superiority and to claim otherwise is, at best, wilfully naive. If we\u2019re being nice about it. Stormzy: who says that grime doesn\u2019t pay? If being on the cover of Time magazine was ever devalued by the knowledge that Donald Trump simply mocked up a favourable one with which to decorate some of his golf courses (with the gripping and punctuationally-challenged headline The Apprentice is a television smash!\u201d), like a Moonpig birthday card, then Stormzy has arrived to make sure everyone knows that it matters again. The \u201cambassador for grime\u201d and south London MC is one of the magazine\u2019s Next Generation Leaders, along with Greta Thunberg and Rosalia, among others. \u201cI am deeply flawed and still learning how to be a man... but... I have purpose. And my purpose has led me here,\u201d he wrote, posting the cover to Instagram. In the accompanying interview, by Reni Eddo-Lodge, Stormzy discusses his commitment to fighting \u201cthis historical thing of letting one black person in at a time\u201d, explaining why he brought other grime artists on to the stage during his incendiary Glastonbury headlining slot, why he launched Merky Books and its accompanying annual prize to bring on young black writers and why he established the Stormzy Scholarship, to fund two black students\u2019 fees and living costs at Cambridge University. This initiative has been credited with a rise in the number of black British students studying at Cambridge. The university reported that for the first time, black students made up more than 3% of new undergraduates. The numbers are still impossibly small, but it is an improvement \u2013 91 black students were admitted, up from 61 in 2018. More black students are taking part in outreach programmes, which the university also credits to the high profile of Stormzy\u2019s involvement. It has been described as \u201cthe Stormzy effect\u201d. Not only did he appear on the cover of Time, then, but he gave his name to an effect. That is a good week\u2019s work. Didier Queloz, a Nobel prize for chutzpah Congratulations to Professor Didier Queloz, the Cambridge University astronomer who shared the Nobel prize for physics with James Peebles and Michel Mayor for their work on the evolution of the universe and the discovery of the first planet outside our solar system in 1995. Their extraordinary achievements will hover frustratingly close to the tip of my tongue during a future round of University Challenge, only to retreat like a frightened mouse at the crucial moment, and that is why they are Nobel prize winners and I can barely get the contemporary music questions right. Queloz revealed that he was having a bad day when the Nobel news came through. His bike had a puncture and he was sitting through a difficult fundraising meeting about a new project. Brilliantly, he ignored a call from the committee, because he did not recognise the number. A friend had to tell him the news.

The Irish writer had been lying face down on his couch, mid-physiotherapy session, when he received a call from a man purporting to be Mats Malm, the permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, half an hour before the true winners would be revealed at a ceremony in Stockholm on Thursday. \u201cHe asked me if I would prefer the 2018 or 2019 prize and read me the citation he would print about my work,\u201d Banville recalled. \u201cHe was very convincing. I rang everybody I could think of to tell them about this good news.\u201d But 40 minutes later Banville received a phone call from his daughter, after she had seen the live announcement, who told him: \u201cIt\u2019s not you.\u201d \u201cI realised then that it must have been a hoax. I rang everybody again and said: \u2018Don\u2019t buy the champagne, stop throwing your hats in the air.\u2019\u201d At this year\u2019s ceremony, Austrian author Peter Handke was awarded the 2019 literature prize while Polish writer Olga Tokarczuk was crowned 2018 winner. A voicemail left on Banville\u2019s phone shortly after the announcement explained that there had been a last-minute disagreement among decision-makers. But, after scrutinising the message, Banville noticed that voice was \u201cdeeper\u201d than that of the real Mats Malm and lacked the same \u201csmooth\u201d grasp of English. He has since shared the message with the Swedish Academy to investigate the incident. Banville believes the hoax was not directed at him personally but was aimed at undermining the academy, which was is dealing with recent scandal and internal divisions. \u201cI suspect it was some disaffected little creep with a grudge. I don\u2019t think I was the target of it. I was just collateral damage,\u201d he said. After the initial disappointment of realising this year\u2019s \u00a3741,000 prize would not be his, Banville now sees the funny side of the incident. \u201cI learned quite a few things about myself in the 40 minutes I was supposedly a Nobel prize winner,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is some comedy in it and potential material: \u2018The man who nearly won the Nobel prize.\u201d The novelist has been the recipient of the 2005 Booker prize, the 1976 James Tait Black memorial prize, the 2011 Franz Kafka prize and the 2013 Austrian State Prize for European Literature among others. The Swedish Academy has been contacted for comment.",

      "body": "<p>The National Portrait Gallery\u2019s mini-retrospective of New York painter Elizabeth Peyton offers a heart-swelling, eye-pleasing parade of exquisite faces, from the gifted and famous to the merely really good-looking.</p> <p>Peyton rose to fame in the 1990s for painting beautiful boys \u2013 from friends to pop stars \u2013 and has been stereotyped and belittled for it since. But I love these works for their freshness, vivid colour and immediacy. Peyton gives us unabashed, rapturous admiration and desire. She takes the priapic male screen idol or rock god and melts his symbolic phallus in the heat of the female gaze, in intense paintings small enough to hold. In Peyton\u2019s world of female looking and longing, men are dream figures as ethereal and alluring as unicorns, more beautiful than life. Not all men, obviously.</p> <p>Parts of the exhibition are scattered upstairs in the Tudor and Victorian galleries, so after some trudging one finds, next to a 16th-century portrait of Lord Burghley, a startling image of Liam Gallagher from 1996. His skin is bleached white, his lips ruby red, eyes a piercing blue. It\u2019s the hot vampire version, basically, and Keith Richards, Jarvis Cocker and Richard Ashcroft get the same treatment in portraits ranging from 1996 to 2004. The Darnley portrait of Elizabeth I gets very fair company from a Peyton work called <em>Alizarin Kurt</em>, in which Kurt Cobain is a wedge of pallid cheek and sharp jaw, the rest of his face hidden under a plume of sweeping orange hair. His lips are painted the same shade. There is a Heathcliff-like sepia portrait of Delacroix and a tender charcoal of Napoleon \u2013 as if Napoleon and Delacroix were both hot 20-year-olds who played in bands in the 1990s.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Undeniably seductive though it is, the show reminded me of a 90s fashion shoot: everyone\u2019s white and no one smiles</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Peyton has a glorious way with colour and these portraits capture men at the peak of their beauty and the height of fame, in the glare of the spotlight, the flare of the lens or the woozy light of the morning after. Her paintings reflect a deep grounding in film, theatre, fine art photography and art history, not just pop culture. 2003\u2019s <em>Live to Ride (E.P.)</em> is a gorgeously realised still in which a drowsy, very young Peyton in a red T-shirt leans on a patterned cushion, looking into the afternoon light. In 2003\u2019s <em>Nick (A Luncheonette December 2002)</em> another beautiful loner stares in bashful torment, the khaki of his parka hood toning perfectly with the rainy blues of the city night.</p> <p>Sometimes Peyton\u2019s influences are richer than the paintings they inspire, and sometimes her figures appear to be bored rather than heavy with longing. Yet she is thematically consistent and her ideas are rigorous. A series of large, unfinished-looking paintings are inspired by the operas <em>Manon Lescaut</em>, <em>Parsifal</em> and <em>Lohengrin</em>. They depict nurturing, yearning, vulnerable men, and scenes of mutual, heightened romance between couples. <em>V\u00e5r</em>, from 2013, is a very sexy monochrome piece, delicate and dynamic, of an embracing couple, their faces concealed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"84117ffc421856ddb8f61ab53ee4b71ca557e7b2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/84117ffc421856ddb8f61ab53ee4b71ca557e7b2/0_0_2400_2887/831.jpg\" alt=\"Alizarin Kurt, 1995 by Elizabeth Peyton.\" width=\"831\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alizarin Kurt, 1995 by Elizabeth Peyton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy the Brant Foundation, Greenwich, CT.

I thought the earlier one was a copied snap of a fashion model, with its elegant colours and a face that reveals nothing. Contrast that with the painting from 2016 \u2013 the only substantial work in the post-2013 period. <em>Portrait at the Opera (Elizabeth)</em> looks like <em>Titanic</em>-era (of course) Leonardo DiCaprio. The artist is androgynous, challenging and powerful, her eyes exuding, absorbing and observing the voltage of desire and image-making around her.</p> <p>The aggravating spacing out of works up and down the floors might make visitors give up before seeing the best work in the exhibition. This is in room 24, it\u2019s called <em>Twilight</em> and it\u2019s a tiny oil from 2009. In full, wintry, dreamy colour, gorgeously swept on to the canvas, an adolescent boy and girl stare at each other in rapture. It\u2019s a still from the atmospheric forest scene in director Catherine Hardwicke\u2019s adaptation of Stephenie Meyer\u2019s first novel: a story fixed around a girl\u2019s desire, now filtered through the creations of three female artists in literature, film and painting.</p> <p>Indeed, Peyton excels at representing living female artists. A 2010 portrait of Isa Genzken from a 1980 photograph is full of personality and movement. Her eyes burn with intention, her expression is mistrusting and impatient, her hair ruffled like a woman on the go. The same goes for a small 2015 portrait of designer Phoebe Philo, which zings with sharp charisma.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ff67defa0aed8a5807542dd7b56169741d5997c5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ff67defa0aed8a5807542dd7b56169741d5997c5/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Two Peyton self-portraits: Portrait at the Opera (Elizabeth), 2016; (Self-Portrait), Berlin, 2011.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Two Peyton self-portraits: Portrait at the Opera (Elizabeth), 2016, left; (Self-Portrait), Berlin, 2011.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy the Brant Foundation, Greenwich, CT.

She is topless.</p> <p>From 2013 onwards, the flushed colour and lush solidity bleed out of Peyton\u2019s works and the images balloon, waver and disintegrate. They look unfinished. Even the opera-inspired couples series are merely sketched in paint, with airy incompleteness. A watercolour of David Bowie from 2017 works, with joyful swoops of almost neon colour. But in a 2016 portrait of Dan Kjaer Nielson, the piercing eyes and pursed mouth contrast with a crudely daubed shirt and trousers. Beautiful boy Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet appears in a 2018 rendering of the postcoital scene from <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/29/call-me-by-your-name-review-peach-of-a-romance\" title=\"\">Call Me By Your Name</a></em>, his face lost under dark, dappled purples. Pastel sketches of Sergei Polunin, Pierre Casiraghi and Peyton\u2019s friend Elias are pretty, but look like a gifted teenager\u2019s doodles.</p> <p>We must all grow up in the end. In the fabulous, much-missed 90s days of fashion mavens and style magazines, we used to say it was \u201call about the moment\u201d. That moment has now passed and Peyton\u2019s mature period is yet to cohere. I have long been a Peyton fan and would love to see more of her powerful images of her female peers. Either way, on the basis of this delicate, heady and beautiful show, her admirers still have much to look forward to.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.npg.org.uk/whatson/exhibitions/2019/elizabeth-peyton/\">Elizabeth Peyton: Aire and Angels</a> is at the National Portrait Gallery, London, until 5 January 2020</p>",

Not only did it inspire me to become a writer, it also revealed a new side of my hometown that to this day both fascinates and inspires me.</p> <p>I was born in the city and spent my youth, as many teenagers do, inside the wooden walls of Brighton Pier\u2019s arcade. My favourite arcade machine was rather macabre \u2013 an old automaton of Marie Antoinette on the guillotine that would, on the insertion of a coin, relieve her of her head. It certainly foreshadowed my career as a crime writer.</p> <p>Brighton is much like the sea it borders, an ebbing and flowing place with a constant movement of people in and out, providing an ever-changing study for new characters. The modern incomers are mostly affluent young professionals, students and LGBT+ people attracted to the city for its beauty, vibrant atmosphere and diverse culture.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My favourite arcade machine was Marie Antoinette on the guillotine, which on the insertion of a coin would relieve her of her head</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>However, in the 1930s, it was not a place to escape to but rather a place to escape from, known as \u201cThe murder capital of Europe\u201d \u2013 an unfortunate nickname that came about when three dismembered female bodies were discovered in the train station\u2019s left-luggage lockers. To this day, it is the only place in the UK where a serving chief constable has ever been murdered. Henry Solomon was bludgeoned to death in 1844 while interviewing a man on suspicion of stealing a roll of carpet. The crime was so shocking that it caught the attention of Queen Victoria, who donated to the welfare fund for his widow and nine children.</p> <p>The more you know about the city\u2019s dark history, the more you can see potential for the sinister in the everyday. The bustling, bohemian but claustrophobic Brighton Lanes lend themselves to a chase, the burnt-out skeleton of the West Pier is the ultimate melancholy view for a pensive antagonist, and the enduring outlandishness of the Royal Pavilion is the perfect place to juxtapose with an illicit deal.</p> <p>Surprisingly, Brighton has not been overwritten by other authors. Patrick Hamilton\u2019s <em>The West Pier</em> and Greene\u2019s <em>Brighton Rock</em> are the only novels to have delved in any depth into its criminal underbelly. This has left a lot of space for my own fictional underworld.</p> <p>It has played a massive part in shaping not just my characters but my own character. Many people feel constrained by their hometown and want to spread their wings but I still feel excited by Brighton \u2013 despite its sometimes grisly past.</p> <p><em>\u2022 <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-secret-of-cold-hill-9781509816231.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\">The Secret of Cold Hill</a> by Peter James </em><em>is published</em><em> </em><em>by Macmillan.</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "\u201cHale knew, before he had been in Brighton three hours, that they meant to murder him.\u201d I owe so much to Graham Greene\u2019s Brighton Rock. Not only did it inspire me to become a writer, it also revealed a new side of my hometown that to this day both fascinates and inspires me. I was born in the city and spent my youth, as many teenagers do, inside the wooden walls of Brighton Pier\u2019s arcade. My favourite arcade machine was rather macabre \u2013 an old automaton of Marie Antoinette on the guillotine that would, on the insertion of a coin, relieve her of her head. It certainly foreshadowed my career as a crime writer. Brighton is much like the sea it borders, an ebbing and flowing place with a constant movement of people in and out, providing an ever-changing study for new characters. The modern incomers are mostly affluent young professionals, students and LGBT+ people attracted to the city for its beauty, vibrant atmosphere and diverse culture. However, in the 1930s, it was not a place to escape to but rather a place to escape from, known as \u201cThe murder capital of Europe\u201d \u2013 an unfortunate nickname that came about when three dismembered female bodies were discovered in the train station\u2019s left-luggage lockers. To this day, it is the only place in the UK where a serving chief constable has ever been murdered. Henry Solomon was bludgeoned to death in 1844 while interviewing a man on suspicion of stealing a roll of carpet. The crime was so shocking that it caught the attention of Queen Victoria, who donated to the welfare fund for his widow and nine children. The more you know about the city\u2019s dark history, the more you can see potential for the sinister in the everyday. The bustling, bohemian but claustrophobic Brighton Lanes lend themselves to a chase, the burnt-out skeleton of the West Pier is the ultimate melancholy view for a pensive antagonist, and the enduring outlandishness of the Royal Pavilion is the perfect place to juxtapose with an illicit deal. Surprisingly, Brighton has not been overwritten by other authors. Patrick Hamilton\u2019s The West Pier and Greene\u2019s Brighton Rock are the only novels to have delved in any depth into its criminal underbelly. This has left a lot of space for my own fictional underworld. It has played a massive part in shaping not just my characters but my own character. Many people feel constrained by their hometown and want to spread their wings but I still feel excited by Brighton \u2013 despite its sometimes grisly past. \u2022 The Secret of Cold Hill by Peter James is published by Macmillan.",

My mum was always around, but Dad worked long hours, got up at 4am to go to the wholesale market, bought fruit, sold it all day in Leicester market, came home to do his book work, then fell asleep on the sofa. My abiding childhood memory is playing football in the back garden. My life has always been dominated by sport.</p> <p><strong>I avoid confrontation</strong> at all costs. I really don\u2019t like it. I\u2019m not accustomed to it, and it\u2019s probably the one thing in my life that freaks me out. If there\u2019s a potential flashpoint, I try to get out of the situation. I don\u2019t want to upset people. I hate hurting their feelings. But if I need to argue my case with someone I really care about, a child or a partner, I\u2019ll do that.</p> <p><strong>I like the feeling</strong> of being in control. I rarely lose my temper. People say to me, \u201cHow can you be a footballer and not be competitive?\u201d But I <em>was</em> competitive, and ambitious, and I was very motivated. There\u2019s a difference between being competitive and having a rage.</p> <p><strong>I wish I\u2019d punched</strong> a referee before I retired. As my career developed, this whole \u201c<a href=\"https://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/news/newsid=2439951.html\" title=\"\">He\u2019s never had a yellow card</a>\u201d thing emerged. I wasn\u2019t a saint. Being in Spain for three years, where the cards pop out all over the place, it was a miracle I didn\u2019t get one. People used to joke with me: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just punch the ref for a laugh?\u201d which obviously would have been really stupid, but it might have been funny in my last game.</p> <p><strong>Hearing 50,000 people</strong> singing your name is what you play sport for. It certainly appeals to your ego. It\u2019s the same explosion of joy and relief and satisfaction you get as a fan when your team scores, but multiplied by a hundred, because you\u2019re the hero. It works both ways, of course. You have the same number of people screaming, \u201cGary Lineker, you\u2019re a wanker!\u201d </p> <p><strong>I don\u2019t like </strong>watching myself on TV. If I\u2019m forced to, I always think: \u201cOh God, you look old.\u201d I think most broadcasters will say the same thing and can\u2019t stand looking at themselves. Except Piers Morgan who, I think, quite likes it.</p> <p><strong>Social media</strong> has sparked my public politicisation. Until Twitter emerged, I never voiced my views. Politics at the moment is a shambles. It\u2019s divided and it\u2019s tribal and it\u2019s depressing, and the hatred between Brexiteers and remainers makes me feel sad. Twitter has fuelled that fire. I don\u2019t let what the trolls say bother me \u2013 they\u2019re all talking shit.</p> <p><strong>It might be</strong> unusual, but I get on with both of my ex wives. I had two good marriages. They\u2019re good people. So we get on. One is the mother of my four boys. The other is my best mate. I just think it\u2019s much more grown up that way. And, as I said, I don\u2019t like confrontation.</p> <p><strong>Even if I had</strong> 800m Twitter followers, I still wouldn\u2019t get involved in politics. It\u2019s something I\u2019ve always been interested in, but I\u2019ve got no interest in getting <em>into</em> politics. People used to say, \u201cYou\u2019re outspoken about Fifa. Why don\u2019t you get involved in the running of the game in the Football Association, or Fifa, or Uefa?\u201d It\u2019s not something that excites me.</p> <p><strong>I find cooking</strong> cathartic. It\u2019s become a new passion over the past years; I cook all the time. I like the process of going out and getting the produce, then the preparing. I find it peaceful. It helps me switch off \u2013 and gets me off the phone. </p> <p><em>Behind Closed Doors by Gary Lineker and Danny Baker is published by Century at \u00a320.

I don\u2019t want to upset people. I hate hurting their feelings. But if I need to argue my case with someone I really care about, a child or a partner, I\u2019ll do that. I like the feeling of being in control. I rarely lose my temper. People say to me, \u201cHow can you be a footballer and not be competitive?\u201d But I was competitive, and ambitious, and I was very motivated. There\u2019s a difference between being competitive and having a rage. I wish I\u2019d punched a referee before I retired. As my career developed, this whole \u201cHe\u2019s never had a yellow card\u201d thing emerged. I wasn\u2019t a saint. Being in Spain for three years, where the cards pop out all over the place, it was a miracle I didn\u2019t get one. People used to joke with me: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just punch the ref for a laugh?\u201d which obviously would have been really stupid, but it might have been funny in my last game. Hearing 50,000 people singing your name is what you play sport for. It certainly appeals to your ego. It\u2019s the same explosion of joy and relief and satisfaction you get as a fan when your team scores, but multiplied by a hundred, because you\u2019re the hero. It works both ways, of course. You have the same number of people screaming, \u201cGary Lineker, you\u2019re a wanker!\u201d I don\u2019t like watching myself on TV. If I\u2019m forced to, I always think: \u201cOh God, you look old.\u201d I think most broadcasters will say the same thing and can\u2019t stand looking at themselves. Except Piers Morgan who, I think, quite likes it. Social media has sparked my public politicisation. Until Twitter emerged, I never voiced my views. Politics at the moment is a shambles. It\u2019s divided and it\u2019s tribal and it\u2019s depressing, and the hatred between Brexiteers and remainers makes me feel sad. Twitter has fuelled that fire. I don\u2019t let what the trolls say bother me \u2013 they\u2019re all talking shit. It might be unusual, but I get on with both of my ex wives. I had two good marriages. They\u2019re good people. So we get on. One is the mother of my four boys. The other is my best mate. I just think it\u2019s much more grown up that way. And, as I said, I don\u2019t like confrontation. Even if I had 800m Twitter followers, I still wouldn\u2019t get involved in politics. It\u2019s something I\u2019ve always been interested in, but I\u2019ve got no interest in getting into politics. People used to say, \u201cYou\u2019re outspoken about Fifa. Why don\u2019t you get involved in the running of the game in the Football Association, or Fifa, or Uefa?\u201d It\u2019s not something that excites me. I find cooking cathartic. It\u2019s become a new passion over the past years; I cook all the time. I like the process of going out and getting the produce, then the preparing. I find it peaceful. It helps me switch off \u2013 and gets me off the phone. Behind Closed Doors by Gary Lineker and Danny Baker is published by Century at \u00a320. Buy it for \u00a317.60 at theguardianbookshop.com",

What I really wanted was to send a message that you can be small and still compete.\u201d</p> \n<p>Things started to change for Japan in 2012, when Eddie Jones took over as coach. Ohata had retired by then because of a knee injury and his place had been taken by Toshiaki Hirose, who is from the same city as Ohata and played in the same position, but is a very different character. Hirose cheerfully says he is enjoying this World Cup because he has been able to \u201cdrink beer and watch it on TV\u201d. But Jones saw something he liked in Hirose and made him captain.</p> \n<p>Hirose still shudders when he thinks about what it was like to play for him. \u201cVery tough.

Jones, who once described him as \u201cthe best captain in the game\u201d decided he was not worth his place. Hirose retired soon after and has been working as an actor in a soap set in a rugby club, <em>No Side Game</em>; he is also running a project called Scrum Unison, which teaches Japanese fans to sing along to their national anthem and everyone else\u2019s too.

This year we have another chance so we have to take it.\u201d</p> \n<p>Hirose and Ohata agree that Japan needs more games against the top countries. Hirose would like to see them play in the Rugby Championship alongside Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and Argentina. But more than that, he says: \u201cWe also need to develop a professional domestic league. Right now it\u2019s still amateur, even though we have some professional players in it.\u201d Below that \u201cwe also have to build up the grass roots, the schools, and clubs\u201d.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/29/re-written-history-japan-reacted-shock-win-ireland-rugby-world-cup\">'Re-written history': how Japan reacted to shock win over Ireland</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>First he would scrap the system that forces Japanese children to specialise in one sport from a young age. There are kids watching rugby for the first time now, Hirose says, who cannot switch to it because they are playing baseball. Maybe, he suggests, he will launch an academy. He has already started Japan\u2019s first players\u2019 association.</p> \n<p>Hirose believes there are things Japanese people can learn from his sport. This team, he says, are role-modelling multiculturalism in a monocultural society. \u201cMaybe if our teams was just Japanese it wouldn\u2019t be so successful,\u201d he says, \u201cbut we have Asian guys, Australian guys, Tongan guys, a real mix, not just Japanese.</p> \n<p>\u201cOutside of the sport, our population is shrinking so we need foreigners to immigrate. It\u2019s an important lesson not just for Japanese rugby but for Japan, because we can show people how you can make a successful team from a diverse mix of people.\u201d</p> \n<p>I am not sure Ohata would agree with all that. He talks instead about how, rather than rely on help from the rest of the world, he would like Japan to lead the development of the sport \u201cby sending a message to the other teams in Asia that they can do well too\u201d.</p> \n<p>Where he and Hirose do come together, though, is in their disbelief at how much the game changed in the short time since they retired. Japan are not a team of underdogs anymore.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf they can beat Ireland there\u2019s no limit to what they can do,\u201d says Ohata. \u201cIt\u2019s much bigger already,\u201d says Hirose. \u201cRugby\u2019s not a major sport in Japan yet, but if we get this right it can become one.\u201d</p>",

It is like Hirose is running a one\u2011man campaign to do everything he can for the game. \u201cI don\u2019t just want Japanese people to watch rugby,\u201d he says. \u201cI want them to understand its values too.\u201d He is worried that the World Cup is going to be a missed opportunity, just like the last one. \u201cIn 2015, we beat South Africa and Samoa and maybe then lots of Japanese kids wanted to play rugby, but they had no place to go and play. This year we have another chance so we have to take it.\u201d Hirose and Ohata agree that Japan needs more games against the top countries. Hirose would like to see them play in the Rugby Championship alongside Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and Argentina. But more than that, he says: \u201cWe also need to develop a professional domestic league. Right now it\u2019s still amateur, even though we have some professional players in it.\u201d Below that \u201cwe also have to build up the grass roots, the schools, and clubs\u201d. First he would scrap the system that forces Japanese children to specialise in one sport from a young age. There are kids watching rugby for the first time now, Hirose says, who cannot switch to it because they are playing baseball. Maybe, he suggests, he will launch an academy. He has already started Japan\u2019s first players\u2019 association. Hirose believes there are things Japanese people can learn from his sport. This team, he says, are role-modelling multiculturalism in a monocultural society. \u201cMaybe if our teams was just Japanese it wouldn\u2019t be so successful,\u201d he says, \u201cbut we have Asian guys, Australian guys, Tongan guys, a real mix, not just Japanese. \u201cOutside of the sport, our population is shrinking so we need foreigners to immigrate. It\u2019s an important lesson not just for Japanese rugby but for Japan, because we can show people how you can make a successful team from a diverse mix of people.\u201d I am not sure Ohata would agree with all that. He talks instead about how, rather than rely on help from the rest of the world, he would like Japan to lead the development of the sport \u201cby sending a message to the other teams in Asia that they can do well too\u201d. Where he and Hirose do come together, though, is in their disbelief at how much the game changed in the short time since they retired. Japan are not a team of underdogs anymore. \u201cIf they can beat Ireland there\u2019s no limit to what they can do,\u201d says Ohata. \u201cIt\u2019s much bigger already,\u201d says Hirose. \u201cRugby\u2019s not a major sport in Japan yet, but if we get this right it can become one.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "In the Quebec riding of Beauce, Maxime Bernier is bringing badly needed levity to Canada\u2019s looming federal election. Not the Maxime Bernier who leads the populist rightwing People\u2019s party of Canada most known for its anti-immigration stance The other Maxime Bernier \u2013 a candidate running for the satirical Rhino party in the same district. Bernier has been accused of intentionally trying to sow seeds of confusion in the riding (as Canada\u2019s electoral districts are known), but he is taking his joke candidacy seriously by promising to focus on local issues close to residents\u2019 hearts and wallets. His campaign slogan? \u201cIf you\u2019re not sure, vote for both.\u201d Political satire \u2013 whether it\u2019s a joke party or delivered by a late-night television host \u2013 has long been considered an engine for apathy and cynicism. However, poking fun at politicians and the power systems around them can actually make people more engaged, says Dr Sophia McClennen, a professor and researcher at Penn State, and the author of several books on the influence of political satire. In the case of the Bernier stunt, she sees the joke as part of the Rhinos\u2019 efforts to protect the nation\u2019s democracy. \u201cWe have data that shows people who watch satire shows vote, they send letters, they call Congress, they do all the metrics that you might use to determine whether somebody is politically [engaged],\u201d said McClennen. The Rhino leader, S\u00e9bastien C\u00f4rriveau, searched long and hard for a Bernier of his own, sending messages to at least 70 people with the name before Facebook blocked him for suspicious activity. In the end, the chosen Bernier was the only one who agreed to run. \u201cHe is the best Maxime Bernier I could hope for,\u201d said C\u00f4rriveau. \u201cIt\u2019s a stupid joke, but it works,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019m very, very happy about it, because we have things to say as Rhinoceros. It sometimes sounds stupid, but there\u2019s something hidden under it that\u2019s very intelligent at the same time,\u201d he says. Political satire may be influencing Canadians in the same ways, too, particularly in these increasingly polarized times. Canada\u2019s Rhino party has unsuccessfully run candidates in federal elections off and on since 1963. In the party\u2019s heyday, Pierre Trudeau once called them \u201cthe court jesters of the nation\u201d \u2013 which the party took as a compliment. The party has run on promises of repealing the law of gravity, reforming retail lottery laws by replacing cash prizes with senate seats and improving the economy by giving all Canadians a minimum of two jobs each. Meanwhile, the CBC\u2019s satirical news program This Hour Has 22 Minutes has been on air for 26 years and, more recently, Canadians have welcomed the acerbic wit of the Beaverton\u2019s news website and TV program. There, Beaverton headlines poke at Canadians\u2019 political cynicism: \u201cTrudeau wondering how long until it\u2019s cool for him to do blackface again\u201d and \u201cPutin impressed Canadian voters don\u2019t need help spreading disinformation\u201d. Cynicism isn\u2019t always a bad thing, says McClennen. In fact, it can rally people behind political issues. She points to protest signs, which today poke fun rather than make serious and direct calls for action. \u201cThere\u2019s some energy there, right?\u201d says McClennen. \u201cI\u2019m being critical of the system, but I\u2019m being sassy and sarcastic while I do it. And people are responding to that at a level that we\u2019ve never seen.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Police have announced they have made almost 1,300 arrests of Extinction Rebellion protesters since Monday, as activists hope the weekend will swell their numbers for a march through central London. Animal rights activists affiliated with Extinction Rebellion claimed 28 of their supporters were arrested on Saturday morning while attempting to block access to Billingsgate fish market in east London. On Saturday, the group\u2019s activists are hoping supporters who have been unable to attend demonstrations and actions during the week will join a protest march gathering at Marble Arch from 1.30pm. Others headed to Westminster magistrates court earlier, where the Paralympian James Brown denied causing a public nuisance by climbing on top of a passenger plane at London City airport on Tuesday. Hundreds of protesters remained camped in Trafalgar Square, where police were continuing efforts to remove them from their final roadblock in Westminster, and at a new camp site in Vauxhall. Activists were hopeful that Lambeth council, which has declared a climate emergency, would allow them to use Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens as a \u201csafe space\u201d for up to a week and had planned a programme of workshops and events for campers and visitors. Early on Saturday morning, protesters from Extinction Rebellion\u2019s Animal Rebellion chapter sat down to block the entrance to Billingsgate, the UK\u2019s largest inland fish market, while one demonstrator locked herself to the entrance, a statement from the group said. About 200 protesters who had gathered in Canary Wharf began their protest at about 3.30am, according to the group. Police initially tried to prevent them from reaching the market but relented after negotiations, the group said. Billingsgate management refused a request to enter into a dialogue, according to protesters. The Metropolitan police said there had been 1,290 arrests in connection with Extinction Rebellion protests as of 9.30am on Saturday, but did not respond to a request for comment on the demonstration.

      "bodyText": "A former head of the British army said he was \u201cvery disappointed\u201d at reports that legislation to protect military veterans from prosecution has been removed from the Queen\u2019s speech. Boris Johnson had promised in July to end the pursuit of soldiers over historical allegations of offences committed in operations during the Troubles in Northern Ireland as well as in Iraq and Afghanistan. But according to the Daily Telegraph, Northern Ireland officials and No 10 advisers have persuaded the UK prime minister to omit the legislation from the Queen\u2019s speech scheduled for Monday. The proposed law would have included a statutory presumption against prosecution for current or former personnel for alleged offences committed in the course of duty more than 10 years ago. Gen Lord Dannatt, a former chief of the general staff, said it was a major issue which the government had to address. He told the BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cIt is unacceptable that serving soldiers, particularly large numbers of former soldiers, run the risk of prosecution as a result of operations conducted worldwide and including in Northern Ireland. \u201cNobody is above the law. If soldiers have broken the law and if there is evidence to back up charges against them, then of course they must face the rigours of the law and take the consequences. \u201cBut in the vast majority of cases, British soldiers, particularly in the campaign in Northern Ireland, got up in the morning to do their duty to keep the peace according to the rules of engagement we had, in sharp contrast to terrorists who got up in the morning whose aim was to maim and kill.\u201d A Ministry of Defence consultation on proposals for measures to provide legal protections for armed forces personnel and veterans serving in operations outside the UK closes at 11.59pm on Sunday. The proposals include establishing in law a presumption that current or former personnel will not normally face prosecution for alleged offences committed in the course of duty abroad more than 10 years ago and creating a new partial defence to murder to allow the courts to recognise the \u201coperational context\u201d in which deaths occur. Other proposals include restricting the ability of the courts to extend the time limit for bringing civil claims for personal injury or death. In July, MPs called for a 10-year qualified statute of limitations on the prosecution of soldiers unless compelling new evidence emerged. The House of Commons defence select committee also called on the government to consider amending the Human Rights Act to provide a presumption against prosecution for historical offences. Its report criticised the government for breaking a promise to safeguard veterans of Northern Ireland\u2019s Troubles from the \u201cspectre\u201d of repeated investigations of events that occurred decades ago. MPs welcomed previous MoD proposals to opt out of the European convention on human rights during future conflicts but said under the department\u2019s plans those who served in Northern Ireland or abroad would be subject to different legislative regimes.",

      "body": "<p>Social media can be a grim place \u2013 but this week it transformed into a veritable party thanks to the war of the Wags \u2013 aka the gratifyingly apocalyptic bust-up between Coleen Rooney and Rebekah Vardy.</p> <p>None of us should be in need of a recap, but here\u2019s a quick rundown of events. On Wednesday morning Rooney, wife of footballer Wayne, shared a statement on her Instagram and Twitter accounts, which have a combined following of more than 2 million people. It\u2019s a wrench to condense the poetry it contained \u2013 people had fun comparing her slick storytelling to prizewinning literature \u2013 but in essence it boils down to this: after suspecting that a friend was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/oct/09/coleen-rooney-accuses-rebekah-vardy-leaking-stories-sun\" title=\"\">leaking her private Instagram stories to the <em>Sun</em></a>, Rooney set a trap. She blocked all but one account from viewing her stories, and, lo and behold, the fake stories she shared \u2013 which included a saga about her basement flooding, and one about visiting Mexico to explore gender-selection treatment for her next child \u2013 still turned up in the newspaper. But whodunnit? To defer to her triumphant final line, and a phrase we\u2019ll all have emblazoned on a mug by Christmas: \u201cIt\u2019s \u2026 Rebekah Vardy\u2019s account.\u201d</p> <p>Vardy is denying it \u2013 she has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/oct/10/rebekah-vardy-hires-it-experts-over-coleen-rooney-leak-claims\" title=\"\">hired a cybersecurity expert to prove her innocence</a>. She also introduced her own rich imagery into proceedings, telling the <em>Daily Mail</em> that arguing with Rooney is \u201clike arguing with a pigeon. You can tell it that you are right and it is wrong, but it\u2019s still going to s*** in your hair\u201d.</p> <p>The internet was wide-eyed with glee. WhatsApp groups sprang up to dissect the ins and outs of the case, while Twitter bowed before its newly anointed patron saint: Wagatha Christie. It provided a happy distraction \u2013 a respite from the agony that is the news cycle in 2019. But it seems pretty clear to me that our fascination with the story goes deeper than that. It was a form of catharsis, really, because the fraught social media relationship it exposed is reflected in our own lives online.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s a simple fact that cyber friendships play out in a different way to how they do in real life</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It would be ludicrous to suggest that anyone else\u2019s friendship matches the Shakespearean levels of drama that infuse the Rooney versus Vardy affair. The gong for toxic friendship of the year is theirs, and theirs alone. Still, the episode highlighted some universal perils of online friendships. Now, I\u2019m no Luddite when it comes to keeping up with friends online \u2013 the internet offers global, constant connection, and a wonderful opportunity to ogle your friend\u2019s adorable new terrier. Nevertheless, it\u2019s a simple fact that cyber friendships play out in a different way from how they do in real life. First off, digital life is performative. This means that when you\u2019re engaging with your housemate online \u2013 by liking her Instagram posts, say, or tagging her name under a funny picture on Facebook \u2013 you\u2019re not only corresponding with her, but also with her personal brand. The chasm between the two is never clearer than when you glimpse a post that shows her looking immaculately coiffed and bears the hashtag #livingmybestlife; when you saw her two hours ago she was sprawled hungover on the sofa flecked with TUC cracker crumbs.</p> <p>Nevertheless, it\u2019s easy to prioritise the digital persona over the flesh and blood one. Granted, most of us wouldn\u2019t shop someone\u2019s Instagram stories to a tabloid, as Rooney is accusing Vardy of doing. But, equally, we often take them at face value rather then bothering to check they chime with reality. Shamefully, I\u2019ve \u201cliked\u201d a friend\u2019s upbeat post despite knowing she was feeling the opposite in real life, because the sanitised social media version required less input from me. And, hey, if that\u2019s the narrative of her life she puts online, that\u2019s how she wanted to be seen, right? (That\u2019s the spineless line with which I consoled myself, anyway.)</p> <p>When the tables are turned, and it comes to sharing snippets from our own lives, there\u2019s an odd cognitive dissonance at play. We\u2019re playing to the crowd, but we also demand a degree of intimacy from our audience. For instance, I\u2019m shamelessly voyeuristic when it comes to stalking other people, but when an acquaintance seems bafflingly well-informed about the restaurants I visited on holiday, I feel weird, even though I know full well that I spammed Instagram with pictures of tomato-smothered gnocchi, and if he doesn\u2019t follow me, well, his girlfriend probably does.</p> <p>On another note, the stakes are raised in front of an audience. A comment that would be viewed as teasing in real life can cut deep when it\u2019s deployed in full view of the internet, as one Mumsnet user reported discovering when she got blocked on Facebook by a \u201cclose friend\u201d after jovially commenting on a post about a driving fiasco where the friend meant to say \u201cright of way\u201d instead of \u201cright away\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/12/why-instagram-could-be-a-major-site-for-disinformation-in-the-2020-election\">Why Instagram could be a major site for disinformation in the 2020 US election | Paul M Barrett</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Indeed, on social media, we regularly get roped into conversations with strangers. For example, the hen party WhatsApp group, from what I understand, is obliged by law to contain figures from at least 84 disparate areas of the bride-to-be\u2019s life. This is, on good days, a great way to meet new people \u2013 but on bad days a shortcut to becoming a social pariah as you tell an in-joke that would be deemed callous by everyone except your best friend, who, you\u2019ve just remembered, is not in the group because she\u2019s the actual bride. Your ears burn as you sense a breakout group cranking up to lambast your monstrous sense of humour.</p> <p>The spat between Coleen Rooney and Rebekah Vardy is irresistibly dramatic \u2013 not least because it hints at the disaster that lurks below the surface of our own digital lives. Best not to admit that, though, and instead enthusiastically dissect the affair on WhatsApp with someone who is, unknowingly, your own social media frenemy.</p>",

It was a form of catharsis, really, because the fraught social media relationship it exposed is reflected in our own lives online. It would be ludicrous to suggest that anyone else\u2019s friendship matches the Shakespearean levels of drama that infuse the Rooney versus Vardy affair. The gong for toxic friendship of the year is theirs, and theirs alone. Still, the episode highlighted some universal perils of online friendships. Now, I\u2019m no Luddite when it comes to keeping up with friends online \u2013 the internet offers global, constant connection, and a wonderful opportunity to ogle your friend\u2019s adorable new terrier. Nevertheless, it\u2019s a simple fact that cyber friendships play out in a different way from how they do in real life. First off, digital life is performative. This means that when you\u2019re engaging with your housemate online \u2013 by liking her Instagram posts, say, or tagging her name under a funny picture on Facebook \u2013 you\u2019re not only corresponding with her, but also with her personal brand. The chasm between the two is never clearer than when you glimpse a post that shows her looking immaculately coiffed and bears the hashtag #livingmybestlife; when you saw her two hours ago she was sprawled hungover on the sofa flecked with TUC cracker crumbs. Nevertheless, it\u2019s easy to prioritise the digital persona over the flesh and blood one. Granted, most of us wouldn\u2019t shop someone\u2019s Instagram stories to a tabloid, as Rooney is accusing Vardy of doing. But, equally, we often take them at face value rather then bothering to check they chime with reality. Shamefully, I\u2019ve \u201cliked\u201d a friend\u2019s upbeat post despite knowing she was feeling the opposite in real life, because the sanitised social media version required less input from me. And, hey, if that\u2019s the narrative of her life she puts online, that\u2019s how she wanted to be seen, right? (That\u2019s the spineless line with which I consoled myself, anyway.) When the tables are turned, and it comes to sharing snippets from our own lives, there\u2019s an odd cognitive dissonance at play. We\u2019re playing to the crowd, but we also demand a degree of intimacy from our audience. For instance, I\u2019m shamelessly voyeuristic when it comes to stalking other people, but when an acquaintance seems bafflingly well-informed about the restaurants I visited on holiday, I feel weird, even though I know full well that I spammed Instagram with pictures of tomato-smothered gnocchi, and if he doesn\u2019t follow me, well, his girlfriend probably does. On another note, the stakes are raised in front of an audience. A comment that would be viewed as teasing in real life can cut deep when it\u2019s deployed in full view of the internet, as one Mumsnet user reported discovering when she got blocked on Facebook by a \u201cclose friend\u201d after jovially commenting on a post about a driving fiasco where the friend meant to say \u201cright of way\u201d instead of \u201cright away\u201d. Indeed, on social media, we regularly get roped into conversations with strangers. For example, the hen party WhatsApp group, from what I understand, is obliged by law to contain figures from at least 84 disparate areas of the bride-to-be\u2019s life. This is, on good days, a great way to meet new people \u2013 but on bad days a shortcut to becoming a social pariah as you tell an in-joke that would be deemed callous by everyone except your best friend, who, you\u2019ve just remembered, is not in the group because she\u2019s the actual bride. Your ears burn as you sense a breakout group cranking up to lambast your monstrous sense of humour. The spat between Coleen Rooney and Rebekah Vardy is irresistibly dramatic \u2013 not least because it hints at the disaster that lurks below the surface of our own digital lives. Best not to admit that, though, and instead enthusiastically dissect the affair on WhatsApp with someone who is, unknowingly, your own social media frenemy.",

Asked why State Street offered some fossil-fuel-free investment funds that had clear exposure to the fossil fuel industry, O\u2019Hanley said his company was working hard to improve information about so-called environmental, sustainable and governance (ESG) investing, the acronym used for green investing. \u201cOne person\u2019s ESG isn\u2019t another person\u2019s ESG. Part of this comes down to definitions and again, we would completely agree with you that there needs to be some kind of measurement here. We\u2019re working quite hard on that. We\u2019re working with some of the largest index providers in the world and you will see us announcing a few tools in a very short time frame that will help address that very problem that you\u2019re stating,\u201d O\u2019Hanley said.",

      "body": "<p>I am 10 minutes late for my interview with<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/05/smartphone-addiction-silicon-valley-dystopia\" title=\"\"> behavioural scientist Nir Eyal</a>, and run into the Manhattan cafe where we\u2019re meeting, a dishevelled and apologetic mess. Being late is never ideal, but it\u2019s particularly embarrassing because I\u2019m meeting Eyal to discuss his new book, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/indistractable-9781526610225.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">Indistractable: How To Control Your Attention And Choose Your Life</a>, a guide to staying focused in an age of constant distraction. The hope is that he will teach me, a chronic procrastinator, how to stop wasting my life scrolling through my phone, and finally write that novel. Or, at the very least, be on time for appointments.</p> <p>Dressed in Tech Dad chic \u2013 a crisp button-down shirt and jeans \u2013 Eyal already has coffee and looks busy when I burst in. He dropped his daughter off at science camp this morning, he explains, which is why he picked this spot; he hopes it wasn\u2019t inconvenient. And I shouldn\u2019t worry about being late: \u201cMaybe you can use it in your article, as your introduction.\u201d Obviously, I will have time to think of a better introduction, but I thank him anyway.</p> <p>Until recently, Eyal was what MIT Technology Review called \u201cSilicon Valley\u2019s most visible advocate of habit-forming technology\u201d. His first book, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/08/social-media-copies-gambling-methods-to-create-psychological-cravings\" title=\"\">Hooked: How To Build Habit Forming Products</a> (2013), became a must-read in advertising and tech circles. Eyal has spent the years since helping companies \u2013 from small workout apps such as Fitbod, to Microsoft and PayPal \u2013 manipulate user behaviour. The \u201chook model\u201d he developed advocates building a \u201cmind monopoly\u201d by associating a product with internal emotional triggers, such as loneliness or a fear of missing out. The developer\u2019s goal is that people are triggered to use the product \u201cwith little conscious thought\u201d. Now that we\u2019re all addicted to our devices, he is bringing out a book that will help us get unhooked.</p> <p>Eyal gets a little defensive when I offer up this analysis. Hooked, he stresses, was about building positive habits; it urged companies to improve people\u2019s lives. He even developed what he called a \u201cmanipulation matrix\u201d, a flow-chart that would let companies see if they were using the Hooked model in an ethical way. Further, he says, we need to stop using the word \u201caddicted\u201d when it comes to technology \u2013 because most of us aren\u2019t addicted at all; we\u2019re just guilty of overuse. \u201cAddiction, in people\u2019s minds, means mind control,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you tell yourself, this is addicting me, this is hijacking my brain\u2026 you slough off responsibility. It\u2019s called learned helplessness.\u201d There\u2019s a lot of scare-mongering around technology at the moment, he adds, \u201cparticularly from people who want to sell clicks and thrive on the economics of fear\u201d. But the more mundane truth, he says, is that there is \u201cno mind control\u201d. Our brains aren\u2019t being hijacked.</p> <p>\u201cHijacking is what happened on 9/11,\u201d Eyal scoffs. \u201cIt\u2019s not Facebook \u2013 give me a break.\u201d It\u2019s amazing, he adds, that people don\u2019t see that the alarm around tech is just a repeat of a very old storyline. \u201cIn the 1950s, fearmongers were saying the exact same thing about comic books, literally verbatim: it\u2019s reducing kids\u2019 attention spans; it\u2019s causing them to commit suicide; it\u2019s leading to mental health issues.\u201d Distraction, he stresses, is an age-old problem that is far bigger than technology. He cites a <a href=\"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2014/07/people-would-rather-be-electrically-shocked-left-alone-their-thoughts\" title=\"\">2014 study led by professors at the University of Virginia </a>and published in the journal Science: when left alone in a room containing nothing but an electric shock device, 67% of men and 25% of women gave themselves painful electric shocks to pass the time. We go to great lengths to avoid sitting alone with our thoughts or dealing with internal discomfort. If we want to avoid distraction, we can\u2019t just throw our phones away or go on a digital detox; we need to deal with the psychological reasons we\u2019re looking for distraction in the first place.</p> <p>And this, really, is the central thesis of Indistractible: stop blaming technology for your personal failings and start blaming yourself. Fair enough, but isn\u2019t this letting today\u2019s tech companies shirk responsibility? The constant urge many of us to have to check our phones is very much by design. Can we really compare today\u2019s technology, which touches every aspect of our lives, to comic books and TV?</p> <p>Look, Eyal says, the fact we\u2019re all carrying smartphones means that \u201cdistraction is easier than ever to find\u201d. But he stresses that \u201cThis doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re powerless \u2013 it means we need a new skill set.\u201d His book contains lots of tactical tips for dealing with external triggers such as smartphone notifications; but, most importantly, he thinks, it addresses the psychological \u201cinternal triggers\u201d that tech companies are exploiting. \u201cThe big life lesson here is to look for root causes,\u201d Eyal says. \u201cYou need to aim to spend a little time with your feelings.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Everything, from when I start work to walking the dog, is mapped out. I allocate two minutes for a pat on the\u00a0back</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I promise Eyal that as soon as I leave our meeting I\u2019m going to spend time with my feelings. In the meantime, what\u2019s the quickest thing I can do to stop being distracted? \u201cTimeboxing,\u201d Eyal says. Instead of relying on to-do lists, I should complete an exercise that involves planning out every minute of my week. And by that, I mean <em>every</em> minute: from what time you start eating breakfast to how long you have to socialise with your significant other in the evening. \u201cYou have no right to call something a distraction unless you know what it distracted you from,\u201d is Eyal\u2019s mantra.</p> <p>Timeboxing could even be the answer to gender equality. Eyal says he spent years fighting with his wife about domestic responsibility. He always thought he pulled his weight, until they both did a timeboxing exercise and he realised that \u201clike most women in heterosexual relationships, she was doing more household admin than I was\u201d.</p> <p>There are various timeboxing apps and templates out there (including <a href=\"https://clockify.me/time-blocking-app\" title=\"\">Clockify</a> and <a href=\"http://focuslist.co/\" title=\"\">FocusList</a>) but I start by using Google calendar to schedule a week full of tasks. Everything, from what time I start writing to when I walk the dog, is neatly mapped out. I allocate two minutes to give myself a pat on the back: finally, I am leaving my procrastinating ways behind. But that\u2019s enough work for today; I\u2019ll get to the really hard stuff tomorrow.</p> <p>The new me gets off to a fairly good start. I sit down to work \u2013 on schedule \u2013 at 9am sharp, and start writing. About 20 minutes in, I get a strong urge to get up and make tea. Eyal has prepared me for this: the first thing to do when distraction hits, he says, is to figure out what\u2019s causing it. \u201cThere are only three reasons for a distraction,\u201d he adds. \u201cAn internal trigger, an external trigger or a planning problem.\u201d</p> <p>Honestly, my need for another cup of tea is probably the sign of caffeine addiction; but for the purposes of this exercise I classify it as an \u201cinternal trigger\u201d. According to Eyal, the first thing to do when you have an intrusive thought is to focus on the emotion that precedes it and write it down. I dutifully write: \u201cUgh, I can\u2019t be bothered.\u201d The next step is to spend 10 minutes \u201csurfing the urge\u201d to give in to your distraction, and to figure out <em>why</em> you feel like this. If you still want to give in at the end, then you should just do it. There\u2019s no point, Eyal says, in being \u201cmilitantly abstinent\u201d. This is not a problem I\u2019ve ever suffered from.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5d4ca9dc7fc9d3ba7faaa5dd88e36d5227d77fa0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5d4ca9dc7fc9d3ba7faaa5dd88e36d5227d77fa0/0_141_3759_4747/792.jpg\" alt=\"Nir Eyal, author of Indistractable, a book on how to avoid being distracted by technology.

It sounded extremely Californian and a complete waste of time. However, it is a technique psychologists use to help patients with addiction, and has some scientific backing; one study found that smokers who tried it reduced the number of cigarettes consumed. Paradoxical as it may seem, zooming in on your internal discomfort can actually make it go away. My own experiment certainly reduced my personal tea consumption for the day; more importantly, it reminded me that I don\u2019t need to give in to every impulse. I hate to sound like a deodorant advert, but it was sort of empowering.</p> <p>At 10am, a calendar notification pops up. I\u2019ve scheduled 10 minutes to check my email. Eyal calls email the \u201cmother of all habit-forming products\u201d, one of several technologies he refers to in the book as \u201cslot machines\u201d. The uncertainty of what\u2019s in our inbox means we\u2019re constantly checking it, but most email is a complete waste of time. According to a <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2017/01/why-the-french-email-law-wont-restore-work-life-balance\" title=\"\">study </a><a href=\"https://hbr.org/2017/01/why-the-french-email-law-wont-restore-work-life-balance\" title=\"\">Eyal cites</a>, by management consultants Bain &amp; Co, 25% of our time spent on email is consumed with reading things that shouldn\u2019t have been sent, and 25% is spent responding to things that don\u2019t need to be answered. Eyal advises checking your messages only at specific times and labelling incoming emails \u201creply today\u201d or \u201creply this week\u201d. This, he says, has cut down the time he spends on email by 90%. I am hopeful that it will do the same for me, but it takes me for ever to figure out how to label my emails and I am interrupted in the middle by a calendar notification telling me it\u2019s time to eat the leftovers in the fridge. Obviously, I must stick to my schedule, so email organisation will have to wait.</p> <p>Most of us have times in our day when we\u2019re more likely to slack off, and so need some extra motivation. Eyal recommends using \u201cpre-commitments\u201d to make this sort of unwanted behaviour more difficult. This might mean using an app to prevent you accessing certain websites at specified times, or scheduling focused work sessions with friends or colleagues. If you work from home, there is also a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/aug/05/eight-hacks-my-quest-to-be-more-productive\" title=\"\">tool called Focusmate</a> (in which Eyal has invested) where you spend 50 minutes virtually co-working with a stranger, keeping an eye on each other via your webcams.</p> <p>In order to avoid my usual afternoon slump, I sign up for a 3pm session and am matched with a regular Focusmate user called Isabelle. At the beginning of the session we tell each other our goals \u2013 she\u2019s working on copy for her website \u2013 and then we get on with it. Having a stranger watch you work sounds deeply weird, but you quickly get over that, and it does make you feel more accountable.

I make myself a \u201cconcentration crown\u201d so that my girlfriend knows when I\u2019m focusing and won\u2019t talk to me. (She talks to me anyway and the crown makes me feel stupid.)

      "bodyText": "I am 10 minutes late for my interview with behavioural scientist Nir Eyal, and run into the Manhattan cafe where we\u2019re meeting, a dishevelled and apologetic mess. Being late is never ideal, but it\u2019s particularly embarrassing because I\u2019m meeting Eyal to discuss his new book, Indistractable: How To Control Your Attention And Choose Your Life, a guide to staying focused in an age of constant distraction. The hope is that he will teach me, a chronic procrastinator, how to stop wasting my life scrolling through my phone, and finally write that novel. Or, at the very least, be on time for appointments. Dressed in Tech Dad chic \u2013 a crisp button-down shirt and jeans \u2013 Eyal already has coffee and looks busy when I burst in. He dropped his daughter off at science camp this morning, he explains, which is why he picked this spot; he hopes it wasn\u2019t inconvenient. And I shouldn\u2019t worry about being late: \u201cMaybe you can use it in your article, as your introduction.\u201d Obviously, I will have time to think of a better introduction, but I thank him anyway. Until recently, Eyal was what MIT Technology Review called \u201cSilicon Valley\u2019s most visible advocate of habit-forming technology\u201d. His first book, Hooked: How To Build Habit Forming Products (2013), became a must-read in advertising and tech circles. Eyal has spent the years since helping companies \u2013 from small workout apps such as Fitbod, to Microsoft and PayPal \u2013 manipulate user behaviour. The \u201chook model\u201d he developed advocates building a \u201cmind monopoly\u201d by associating a product with internal emotional triggers, such as loneliness or a fear of missing out. The developer\u2019s goal is that people are triggered to use the product \u201cwith little conscious thought\u201d. Now that we\u2019re all addicted to our devices, he is bringing out a book that will help us get unhooked. Eyal gets a little defensive when I offer up this analysis. Hooked, he stresses, was about building positive habits; it urged companies to improve people\u2019s lives. He even developed what he called a \u201cmanipulation matrix\u201d, a flow-chart that would let companies see if they were using the Hooked model in an ethical way. Further, he says, we need to stop using the word \u201caddicted\u201d when it comes to technology \u2013 because most of us aren\u2019t addicted at all; we\u2019re just guilty of overuse. \u201cAddiction, in people\u2019s minds, means mind control,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you tell yourself, this is addicting me, this is hijacking my brain\u2026 you slough off responsibility. It\u2019s called learned helplessness.\u201d There\u2019s a lot of scare-mongering around technology at the moment, he adds, \u201cparticularly from people who want to sell clicks and thrive on the economics of fear\u201d. But the more mundane truth, he says, is that there is \u201cno mind control\u201d. Our brains aren\u2019t being hijacked. \u201cHijacking is what happened on 9/11,\u201d Eyal scoffs. \u201cIt\u2019s not Facebook \u2013 give me a break.\u201d It\u2019s amazing, he adds, that people don\u2019t see that the alarm around tech is just a repeat of a very old storyline. \u201cIn the 1950s, fearmongers were saying the exact same thing about comic books, literally verbatim: it\u2019s reducing kids\u2019 attention spans; it\u2019s causing them to commit suicide; it\u2019s leading to mental health issues.\u201d Distraction, he stresses, is an age-old problem that is far bigger than technology. He cites a 2014 study led by professors at the University of Virginia and published in the journal Science: when left alone in a room containing nothing but an electric shock device, 67% of men and 25% of women gave themselves painful electric shocks to pass the time. We go to great lengths to avoid sitting alone with our thoughts or dealing with internal discomfort. If we want to avoid distraction, we can\u2019t just throw our phones away or go on a digital detox; we need to deal with the psychological reasons we\u2019re looking for distraction in the first place. And this, really, is the central thesis of Indistractible: stop blaming technology for your personal failings and start blaming yourself. Fair enough, but isn\u2019t this letting today\u2019s tech companies shirk responsibility? The constant urge many of us to have to check our phones is very much by design. Can we really compare today\u2019s technology, which touches every aspect of our lives, to comic books and TV? Look, Eyal says, the fact we\u2019re all carrying smartphones means that \u201cdistraction is easier than ever to find\u201d. But he stresses that \u201cThis doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re powerless \u2013 it means we need a new skill set.\u201d His book contains lots of tactical tips for dealing with external triggers such as smartphone notifications; but, most importantly, he thinks, it addresses the psychological \u201cinternal triggers\u201d that tech companies are exploiting. \u201cThe big life lesson here is to look for root causes,\u201d Eyal says. \u201cYou need to aim to spend a little time with your feelings.\u201d I promise Eyal that as soon as I leave our meeting I\u2019m going to spend time with my feelings. In the meantime, what\u2019s the quickest thing I can do to stop being distracted? \u201cTimeboxing,\u201d Eyal says. Instead of relying on to-do lists, I should complete an exercise that involves planning out every minute of my week. And by that, I mean every minute: from what time you start eating breakfast to how long you have to socialise with your significant other in the evening. \u201cYou have no right to call something a distraction unless you know what it distracted you from,\u201d is Eyal\u2019s mantra. Timeboxing could even be the answer to gender equality. Eyal says he spent years fighting with his wife about domestic responsibility. He always thought he pulled his weight, until they both did a timeboxing exercise and he realised that \u201clike most women in heterosexual relationships, she was doing more household admin than I was\u201d. There are various timeboxing apps and templates out there (including Clockify and FocusList) but I start by using Google calendar to schedule a week full of tasks. Everything, from what time I start writing to when I walk the dog, is neatly mapped out. I allocate two minutes to give myself a pat on the back: finally, I am leaving my procrastinating ways behind. But that\u2019s enough work for today; I\u2019ll get to the really hard stuff tomorrow. The new me gets off to a fairly good start. I sit down to work \u2013 on schedule \u2013 at 9am sharp, and start writing. About 20 minutes in, I get a strong urge to get up and make tea. Eyal has prepared me for this: the first thing to do when distraction hits, he says, is to figure out what\u2019s causing it. \u201cThere are only three reasons for a distraction,\u201d he adds. \u201cAn internal trigger, an external trigger or a planning problem.\u201d Honestly, my need for another cup of tea is probably the sign of caffeine addiction; but for the purposes of this exercise I classify it as an \u201cinternal trigger\u201d. According to Eyal, the first thing to do when you have an intrusive thought is to focus on the emotion that precedes it and write it down. I dutifully write: \u201cUgh, I can\u2019t be bothered.\u201d The next step is to spend 10 minutes \u201csurfing the urge\u201d to give in to your distraction, and to figure out why you feel like this. If you still want to give in at the end, then you should just do it. There\u2019s no point, Eyal says, in being \u201cmilitantly abstinent\u201d. This is not a problem I\u2019ve ever suffered from. When Eyal first told me to \u201csurf the urge\u201d, I scoffed. It sounded extremely Californian and a complete waste of time. However, it is a technique psychologists use to help patients with addiction, and has some scientific backing; one study found that smokers who tried it reduced the number of cigarettes consumed. Paradoxical as it may seem, zooming in on your internal discomfort can actually make it go away.

The uncertainty of what\u2019s in our inbox means we\u2019re constantly checking it, but most email is a complete waste of time.

This, he says, has cut down the time he spends on email by 90%. I am hopeful that it will do the same for me, but it takes me for ever to figure out how to label my emails and I am interrupted in the middle by a calendar notification telling me it\u2019s time to eat the leftovers in the fridge. Obviously, I must stick to my schedule, so email organisation will have to wait. Most of us have times in our day when we\u2019re more likely to slack off, and so need some extra motivation. Eyal recommends using \u201cpre-commitments\u201d to make this sort of unwanted behaviour more difficult. This might mean using an app to prevent you accessing certain websites at specified times, or scheduling focused work sessions with friends or colleagues. If you work from home, there is also a tool called Focusmate (in which Eyal has invested) where you spend 50 minutes virtually co-working with a stranger, keeping an eye on each other via your webcams. In order to avoid my usual afternoon slump, I sign up for a 3pm session and am matched with a regular Focusmate user called Isabelle.

      "body": "<h2><strong>What is an asset manager?</strong></h2> <p>Asset managers invest other people\u2019s money with the aim of growing their client\u2019s wealth and protecting them from financial risk. By pooling lots of investors\u2019 money they can reduce the risk to them by spreading it across a range of asset classes: stocks, property, bonds, commodities and other funds. Asset managers make money by taking a fee for providing these services to their clients.</p> <p>Since the 2008 financial crisis, high fees and poor performance have seen money flowing away from \u201cactive\u201d funds, with a manager who researches and selects investments using a particular philosophy, to \u201cpassive\u201d funds.</p> <h2><strong>What is a passive fund?</strong></h2> <p>The most common form of passive investing is a \u201ctracker fund\u201d that follows an index such as the FTSE 100 or the S&amp;P 500. Instead of selecting particular companies in which to invest, passive fund managers buy everything on an index and hold the shares over a long period of time.</p> <p>Supporters of this approach argue it has democratised share ownership in the best companies in the world while driving down fees in the asset management industry.</p> <h2><strong>Where do they get their money from?</strong></h2> <p>You, most likely. If you make pension contributions every month or have invested personal savings, it is likely that this money ends up with an asset manager via your pension provider.</p> <p>Even though asset managers do not own the companies they invest in, they exercise shareholder rights on your behalf, voting on directors and key company decisions. It\u2019s a useful service. Who has time to go through hundreds of company disclosures every quarter and take a view on them? But it also means that a small group of asset managers have a big say on how the largest publicly listed companies approach the biggest challenges of our era.</p> <h2><strong>How much money do they manage?</strong></h2> <p>About $74tn globally in 2018, according to the Boston Consulting Group\u2019s latest industry survey, a slight fall from $77tn the year before. In the US, which has the largest asset management industry by far, the market is dominated by BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street. </p> <h2><strong>Can individual investors decide where their money goes?</strong></h2> <p>Your pension provider may allow you to choose between funds, and before you invest any of your other money you can research funds and see what companies they own shares in. You could pick one that avoids polluting companies. But once your money is in a fund, you will not be consulted on every investment decision or on voting decisions.</p> <p>If you have concerns about how your pension is being managed, get in contact with your provider and ask the trustees how your money is being invested and what stance they take on climate-related shareholder motions.</p> <h2><strong>Why are they still investing in fossil fuel companies?</strong></h2> <p>The simple answer is because they make money. For now, at least. The world needs fossil fuels and will continue to need them during the energy transition, albeit on a much smaller scale.</p> <p>Publicly listed fossil fuel companies remain among the most profitable companies in the world, so if you invest in an index tracker fund, like millions of people do, they will be there. You will get Apple, Google and Facebook, as well as ExxonMobil and Chevron.</p> <h2><strong>How much money are the asset managers putting into fossil fuel companies?</strong></h2> <p>Hundreds of billions of dollars, but it\u2019s hard to be exact. According to research about the three largest, the combined fossil fuel portfolio of BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street is $286bn. The figure came from analysing 1,712 funds run by BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street to determine their holdings in the 299 companies that control 95% of global fossil fuel reserves and production run by publicly listed companies.</p> <p>These holdings can also be expressed in terms of potential CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in coal, oil and gas reserves.

      "bodyText": "What is an asset manager? Asset managers invest other people\u2019s money with the aim of growing their client\u2019s wealth and protecting them from financial risk. By pooling lots of investors\u2019 money they can reduce the risk to them by spreading it across a range of asset classes: stocks, property, bonds, commodities and other funds. Asset managers make money by taking a fee for providing these services to their clients. Since the 2008 financial crisis, high fees and poor performance have seen money flowing away from \u201cactive\u201d funds, with a manager who researches and selects investments using a particular philosophy, to \u201cpassive\u201d funds. What is a passive fund? The most common form of passive investing is a \u201ctracker fund\u201d that follows an index such as the FTSE 100 or the S&amp;P 500. Instead of selecting particular companies in which to invest, passive fund managers buy everything on an index and hold the shares over a long period of time. Supporters of this approach argue it has democratised share ownership in the best companies in the world while driving down fees in the asset management industry. Where do they get their money from? You, most likely. If you make pension contributions every month or have invested personal savings, it is likely that this money ends up with an asset manager via your pension provider. Even though asset managers do not own the companies they invest in, they exercise shareholder rights on your behalf, voting on directors and key company decisions. It\u2019s a useful service. Who has time to go through hundreds of company disclosures every quarter and take a view on them? But it also means that a small group of asset managers have a big say on how the largest publicly listed companies approach the biggest challenges of our era. How much money do they manage? About $74tn globally in 2018, according to the Boston Consulting Group\u2019s latest industry survey, a slight fall from $77tn the year before. In the US, which has the largest asset management industry by far, the market is dominated by BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street. Can individual investors decide where their money goes? Your pension provider may allow you to choose between funds, and before you invest any of your other money you can research funds and see what companies they own shares in. You could pick one that avoids polluting companies. But once your money is in a fund, you will not be consulted on every investment decision or on voting decisions. If you have concerns about how your pension is being managed, get in contact with your provider and ask the trustees how your money is being invested and what stance they take on climate-related shareholder motions. Why are they still investing in fossil fuel companies? The simple answer is because they make money. For now, at least. The world needs fossil fuels and will continue to need them during the energy transition, albeit on a much smaller scale. Publicly listed fossil fuel companies remain among the most profitable companies in the world, so if you invest in an index tracker fund, like millions of people do, they will be there. You will get Apple, Google and Facebook, as well as ExxonMobil and Chevron. How much money are the asset managers putting into fossil fuel companies? Hundreds of billions of dollars, but it\u2019s hard to be exact. According to research about the three largest, the combined fossil fuel portfolio of BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street is $286bn. The figure came from analysing 1,712 funds run by BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street to determine their holdings in the 299 companies that control 95% of global fossil fuel reserves and production run by publicly listed companies. These holdings can also be expressed in terms of potential CO2 emissions in coal, oil and gas reserves. These have increased by 17% above the rate at which money has flowed into the funds since 2016. At BlackRock potential CO2 emissions are up 5%, at State Street 23% and at Vanguard 28% when controlling for fund inflows.",

Renewables also mean new jobs: a crucial goal of the kingdom\u2019s plan to future-proof the Saudi Arabian economy by relying less on the vast oil reserve beneath its sands. The recasting of green energy as a national interest, coupled with record low prices for solar and wind power in particular, has raised hopes that this latest push by the kingdom to build renewable capacity might be more successful. Saudi Arabia recently tripled its renewable energy target and has successfully tendered for large-scale projects in wind and solar energy. Yet alongside this, over the past decade, Saudi Arabia has increased its oil production by 2m barrels a day. Even the United Arab Emirates, a frontrunner in the region responsible for nearly 70% of all installed renewable capacity in the Arab Gulf in the past four years, has increased its oil production by 800,000 barrels a day over the past decade. \u201cYou always have that paradigm between what the governments [in the region] say in terms of energy policy \u2013 that they want to get away from oil dependence, for environmental as well as for financial reasons \u2013 and what they do,\u201d says Homayoun Falakshahi, an oil and gas equity analyst at the energy intelligence firm Kpler. \u201cIn practice, they are actually increasing their production capacity and putting out tenders for more work to be done in their oilfields.\u201d Steep curbs on fossil-fuel use, of the kinds scientists say are required to prevent catastrophic increases in global temperatures, would significantly hurt the bottom lines of the region\u2019s state-owned oil companies. Saudi Arabia\u2019s state-owned oil giant Aramco, the greatest contributor to global carbon emissions of any company in the world since 1965, said as much in a 469-page prospectus it issued in April before the company\u2019s first international bond offering. Under \u201crisk factors\u201d, it warned investors that popular concerns about the climate crisis, as well as its physical impacts on the planet, \u201ccould shift demand to lower carbon intensity fossil fuels \u2026 [and] have a material adverse effect on the company\u2019s business\u201d.

      "bodyText": "The world\u2019s three largest money managers have built a combined $300bn fossil fuel investment portfolio using money from people\u2019s private savings and pension contributions, the Guardian can reveal. BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street, which together oversee assets worth more than China\u2019s entire GDP, have continued to grow billion-dollar stakes in some of the most carbon-intensive companies since the Paris agreement, financial data shows. The two largest asset managers, BlackRock and Vanguard, have also routinely opposed motions at fossil fuel companies that would have forced directors to take more action on climate change, the analysis reveals. The investment rise is driven by the success in the last decade of tracker funds that use algorithms to follow major stock exchange indices such as the FTSE 100 and S&amp;P 500. The Guardian has worked with the thinktank InfluenceMap and the business data specialists ProxyInsight to analyse the role played by asset managers in the financing and management of some of the world\u2019s biggest fossil fuel companies. Figures compiled by InfluenceMap show how Blackrock, Vanguard and State Street \u2013 known as the big three \u2013 have become crucial climate actors in the financial world. They are the largest money managers in the $74tn industry. According to an analysis of the data, their effective thermal coal, oil and gas reserve holdings through the companies they manage have surged 34.8% since 2016. This means they are now the largest investors in public oil, gas and coal companies, managing funds for large pension funds, university endowments and insurance companies. While asset managers do not own the companies in which they invest, they often exercise shareholders rights on behalf of clients to vote on board members and company policy issues. Disclosures for publicly available company reports show that from 2015 to 2019 Vanguard and BlackRock used their votes to frequently oppose efforts to improve climate-related financial disclosures. The investigation by the Guardian has found: Vanguard ($161.1bn), BlackRock ($87.3bn) and State Street ($38.3bn) oversee a combined $286.7bn of shares in oil, coal and gas companies through 1,712 funds. Their total combined portfolio is likely to be higher as the calculation excludes direct holdings and non-listed fund holdings. The potential CO2 emissions from the investments have increased from 10.593 gigatonnes (Gt) to 14.283Gt since the Paris agreement, equivalent to 38% of global fossil fuel CO2 emissions last year. BlackRock and Vanguard opposed or abstained on more than 80% of climate-related motions at FTSE 100 and S&amp;P 500 fossil fuel companies between 2015 and 2019, according to data provided by ProxyInsight. The big three are among a number of asset managers that offer \u201cclimate-friendly\u201d and \u201csustainable\u201d investment funds that have substantial holdings in fossil fuel companies. BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street did not challenge the findings. They told the Guardian they prioritised private engagements with company boards, where the climate crisis was regularly discussed. They said they had increased the size of their teams responsible for investment stewardship, opting to use their votes as a final resort.

Campaigners are demanding asset managers vote out company directors who are not deemed to be taking sufficient action. In June, the London-based Legal &amp; General, formerly a top 20 investor in ExxonMobil, announced it was selling a $300m stake in the company and would use remaining shares to vote against the chief executive, Darren Woods. But environmental shareholder proposals face increasing challenges from the management of fossil fuel companies, which are being sustained by the American regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission.

      "body": "<p>We can be better people. This truth, simply expressed, is key to both works in English Touring Opera\u2019s <a href=\"http://englishtouringopera.org.uk/tour-dates/\" title=\"\">autumn season</a>. Morals and happy endings can make dull art. To say ETO\u2019s productions hit home because of the times we live in is certainly the case. It shouldn\u2019t obscure the quality, deftness and originality of these two shows, staged on a tight budget and adaptable for eight different venues. Mozart\u2019s <em>Die Entf\u00fchrung aus dem Serail</em>, sung in English as <em>The Seraglio</em>, and Kurt Weill\u2019s <em>The Silver Lake</em> will tour from Durham to Exeter in the coming weeks. Each piece, contrasting in nearly every respect but both characterised by the use of spoken dialogue, makes you think, listen and feel.</p> <p>At Hackney Empire, members of <a href=\"https://www.streetwiseopera.org/\" title=\"\">Streetwise Opera</a> joined a well-drilled chorus. Different local choirs will participate in every locality. If ETO did nothing else, that logistical task alone would be an achievement. <strong><a href=\"http://englishtouringopera.org.uk/productions/the-silver-lake\" title=\"\">The Silver Lake</a></strong> \u2013 <em>Der Silbersee</em> \u2013 by Kurt Weill and Georg Kaiser, first performed in Germany in 1933 three weeks after Hitler became chancellor, and banned by the Nazis as degenerate, has a greater generosity than the composer\u2019s later collaborations with Brecht.</p> <p>Yet its satire remains sharp, attacking political extremism, exposing the effects of poverty, pillorying the rich. The skilful cast, led by David Webb (Severin), Ronald Samm (Olim) and Luci Briginshaw (Fennimore), excelled. James Holmes, a Weill expert, conducted a performance that was rhythmically taut but jazzy and flexible. Staged and in large part conceived by ETO\u2019s artistic director, James Conway, this play-with-music built to a compelling climax. Humanity wins the day.</p> <p>Thanks to Adam Wiltshire\u2019s designs, it was a short step from the bare, cage-scaffold structure of the Weill to the lavish, Topkapi-inspired prison of the Pasha\u2019s harem in Mozart\u2019s <strong><a href=\"http://englishtouringopera.org.uk/productions/the-seraglio-2019\" title=\"\">The Seraglio</a></strong>. Acknowledging but surmounting stereotype \u2013 this is a tale of Christians and Muslims that turns out well \u2013 Stephen Medcalf\u2019s traditional but never staid production emphasised humour and tenderness. Lucy Hall as Konstanze and John-Colyn Gyeantey as Belmonte were secure in the vocally challenging \u201cstraight\u201d roles. Alex Andreou put flesh on the spoken role of Pasha, which can on occasion be wooden. Matthew Stiff\u2019s big-hearted, bullying Osmin, Richard Pinkstone\u2019s impish Pedrillo and Nazan Fikret\u2019s no-messing Blonde provoked ready laughter. Comic antics never fought with the fertile invention of Mozart\u2019s music, incisively and insightfully conducted by John Andrews. <em>Die Entf\u00fchrung</em>, sometimes overshadowed, shone here in all its genius. ETO\u2019s versatile orchestra, classy woodwind section deserving top marks in both operas, gave their all.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a1fabd3dca9fd4325f4e6931b1d1fbb45abbefd8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a1fabd3dca9fd4325f4e6931b1d1fbb45abbefd8/0_0_4898_3192/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nazan Fikret (Blonde) and Matthew Stiff (Osmin) in The Seraglio.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"652\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nazan Fikret (Blonde) and Matthew Stiff (Osmin) in The Seraglio.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jane Hobson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Space is too limited \u2013 the gods smile occasionally \u2013 to permit too detailed an account of English National Opera\u2019s new staging of Offenbach\u2019s <strong><a href=\"https://www.eno.org/whats-on/orpheus-in-the-underworld/\" title=\"\">Orpheus in the Underworld</a></strong> (1858/74), conducted by Sian Edwards, directed by Emma Rice (ex-Shakespeare\u2019s Globe) in her operatic debut, designed by Lizzie Clachan. Offenbach lampooned, with exquisite precision, any social or political target in his line of vision. The death of a baby was not one. This was the extraneous scene-setter in Rice\u2019s new version, complete with \u201cBaby\u201d floral wreath and tiny coffin. The image indelibly imprinted on our mind\u2019s eye, all joy was smothered in the opening minutes. It was the prelude to a night of flat jokes and dramatic miscalculations.</p> <p>Striving for positives: ENO\u2019s cast had individual strengths \u2013 Mary Bevan as a spirited Eurydice, Ed Lyon making the most of the slight title role, Alex Otterburn terrific as a sleazy Pluto, Willard White bemused as Jupiter but singing seductively and nobly as ever. The American baritone Lucia Lucas, in a promising ENO debut as Public Opinion, was coerced into cockney cabbie mode. A US limo driver might have fitted better with the Beverly Hills-style Mount Olympus of Clachan\u2019s sets. Witty one-liners were lost, the words of the ensemble of gods inaudible (with the exceptions of Anne-Marie Owens and Keel Watson), unless you stayed glued to the subtitles.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c3e0859a599e54aebc0e6085fea09a53842b7e04\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c3e0859a599e54aebc0e6085fea09a53842b7e04/0_0_4413_3016/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Orpheus in the Underworld at the Coliseum.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"683\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Orpheus in the Underworld at the Coliseum.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Everyone needed more direction: either towards choreographed exactitude or to anarchic freedom. Each would have worked. Comedic purgatory is no destination for Orpheus in any telling of the story. The chorus, wearing white balloon-tutus, injected what energy they could. Edwards coaxed some eloquent if still too stately playing from the orchestra. It may quicken into life as confidence grows in the many performances of this run. All three stars are awarded to the performers.</p> <p>No such uncertainty with William Alwyn\u2019s <strong>Miss Julie</strong> (1977), long neglected and receiving a semi-staging (by Kenneth Richardson) by the BBC Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Sakari Oramo, with a top quartet of soloists led by <a href=\"https://www.annapatalong.com/\" title=\"\">Anna Patalong</a>, sensational, strong and vulnerable in the title role. Benedict Nelson, a heroic late replacement, was chillingly convincing as the conniving Jean, given perceptive support by Rosie Aldridge as the cook-lover Kristin and Samuel Sakker as the drunken Ulrik.</p> <p>Alwyn (1905-85), best known for his film scores, wrote his own libretto based on August Strindberg\u2019s tragedy.

      "bodyText": "We can be better people. This truth, simply expressed, is key to both works in English Touring Opera\u2019s autumn season. Morals and happy endings can make dull art. To say ETO\u2019s productions hit home because of the times we live in is certainly the case. It shouldn\u2019t obscure the quality, deftness and originality of these two shows, staged on a tight budget and adaptable for eight different venues. Mozart\u2019s Die Entf\u00fchrung aus dem Serail, sung in English as The Seraglio, and Kurt Weill\u2019s The Silver Lake will tour from Durham to Exeter in the coming weeks. Each piece, contrasting in nearly every respect but both characterised by the use of spoken dialogue, makes you think, listen and feel. At Hackney Empire, members of Streetwise Opera joined a well-drilled chorus. Different local choirs will participate in every locality. If ETO did nothing else, that logistical task alone would be an achievement. The Silver Lake \u2013 Der Silbersee \u2013 by Kurt Weill and Georg Kaiser, first performed in Germany in 1933 three weeks after Hitler became chancellor, and banned by the Nazis as degenerate, has a greater generosity than the composer\u2019s later collaborations with Brecht. Yet its satire remains sharp, attacking political extremism, exposing the effects of poverty, pillorying the rich. The skilful cast, led by David Webb (Severin), Ronald Samm (Olim) and Luci Briginshaw (Fennimore), excelled. James Holmes, a Weill expert, conducted a performance that was rhythmically taut but jazzy and flexible. Staged and in large part conceived by ETO\u2019s artistic director, James Conway, this play-with-music built to a compelling climax. Humanity wins the day. Thanks to Adam Wiltshire\u2019s designs, it was a short step from the bare, cage-scaffold structure of the Weill to the lavish, Topkapi-inspired prison of the Pasha\u2019s harem in Mozart\u2019s The Seraglio. Acknowledging but surmounting stereotype \u2013 this is a tale of Christians and Muslims that turns out well \u2013 Stephen Medcalf\u2019s traditional but never staid production emphasised humour and tenderness. Lucy Hall as Konstanze and John-Colyn Gyeantey as Belmonte were secure in the vocally challenging \u201cstraight\u201d roles. Alex Andreou put flesh on the spoken role of Pasha, which can on occasion be wooden. Matthew Stiff\u2019s big-hearted, bullying Osmin, Richard Pinkstone\u2019s impish Pedrillo and Nazan Fikret\u2019s no-messing Blonde provoked ready laughter. Comic antics never fought with the fertile invention of Mozart\u2019s music, incisively and insightfully conducted by John Andrews. Die Entf\u00fchrung, sometimes overshadowed, shone here in all its genius. ETO\u2019s versatile orchestra, classy woodwind section deserving top marks in both operas, gave their all. Space is too limited \u2013 the gods smile occasionally \u2013 to permit too detailed an account of English National Opera\u2019s new staging of Offenbach\u2019s Orpheus in the Underworld (1858/74), conducted by Sian Edwards, directed by Emma Rice (ex-Shakespeare\u2019s Globe) in her operatic debut, designed by Lizzie Clachan. Offenbach lampooned, with exquisite precision, any social or political target in his line of vision. The death of a baby was not one. This was the extraneous scene-setter in Rice\u2019s new version, complete with \u201cBaby\u201d floral wreath and tiny coffin. The image indelibly imprinted on our mind\u2019s eye, all joy was smothered in the opening minutes. It was the prelude to a night of flat jokes and dramatic miscalculations. Striving for positives: ENO\u2019s cast had individual strengths \u2013 Mary Bevan as a spirited Eurydice, Ed Lyon making the most of the slight title role, Alex Otterburn terrific as a sleazy Pluto, Willard White bemused as Jupiter but singing seductively and nobly as ever. The American baritone Lucia Lucas, in a promising ENO debut as Public Opinion, was coerced into cockney cabbie mode. A US limo driver might have fitted better with the Beverly Hills-style Mount Olympus of Clachan\u2019s sets. Witty one-liners were lost, the words of the ensemble of gods inaudible (with the exceptions of Anne-Marie Owens and Keel Watson), unless you stayed glued to the subtitles. Everyone needed more direction: either towards choreographed exactitude or to anarchic freedom. Each would have worked. Comedic purgatory is no destination for Orpheus in any telling of the story. The chorus, wearing white balloon-tutus, injected what energy they could. Edwards coaxed some eloquent if still too stately playing from the orchestra. It may quicken into life as confidence grows in the many performances of this run. All three stars are awarded to the performers. No such uncertainty with William Alwyn\u2019s Miss Julie (1977), long neglected and receiving a semi-staging (by Kenneth Richardson) by the BBC Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Sakari Oramo, with a top quartet of soloists led by Anna Patalong, sensational, strong and vulnerable in the title role. Benedict Nelson, a heroic late replacement, was chillingly convincing as the conniving Jean, given perceptive support by Rosie Aldridge as the cook-lover Kristin and Samuel Sakker as the drunken Ulrik. Alwyn (1905-85), best known for his film scores, wrote his own libretto based on August Strindberg\u2019s tragedy. The opera\u2019s emotional style, cinematic and impassioned, hardly sat well amid the atonal sobriety favoured in the mid-1970s. We\u2019re over such heinous divisions, in music anyway. Time for a full staging. A recording is due shortly. Catch it on BBC Sounds and be enthralled.

      "bodyText": "Thanks for your company tonight. Apologies I couldn\u2019t bring you a goal in the A-League, but I can bring you a Rugby World Cup liveblog. Enjoy! A tense, absorbing encounter in front of 33, 523 fans at Marvel Stadium. It\u2019s unlikely either team will be too happy or unhappy, and though highlights were not in great supply the scoreline could have been different. City could have scored - Wales in the first half, Najjar in the second might have done better - while Victory did score, only to have Kamsoba\u2019s strike ruled out after VAR\u2019s intervention. 90 mins +3: Toivonen and Delbridge are going at it in the closing minutes. Both players get a yellow card as finally, finally, this match springs to life. 86 mins: Poulsen makes way for Basha as Victory make their final change. A free kick deep on the left puts Toivonen in a dangerous position but City defenders are not troubled. 82 mins: More sharp and desperate defending from Broxham, who gets his toe in just in time to deny Metcalfe. Time for City\u2019s second change: Najjarine on, Luna off. We\u2019re in the home straight now. Goal anyone? 75 mins: Nabbout squanders a couple of half chances in a promising period for Victory, who then make a second change with Brown entering the fray for Traore. It\u2019s still 0-0. 69 mins: A change for both teams with Victory bringing in Hope for Dobras and City giving Wales the rest of the night off off, with Najjar taking his place. 63 mins: More inventive play from Noone, who traps a long ball at his feet and beats a defender before unfurling a shot ... straight at the keeper. Metcalfe then has a shot from similar range with his left that really asks a question of the keeper. No breakthrough but a good couple of minutes for City. 57 mins: NO GOAL! Melbourne Victory 0-0 Melbourne City Toivonen releases Kamsoba with a delightful ball and the resultant shot beats the keeper low to his left en route to the side netting. Victory players go nuts but on review the scorer is judged to be marginally off-side. No goal. A mighty shame for the game. Great lead-up play. VAR strikes again. 52 mins: Toivonen finds himself with a rare patch of land just outside the box and can\u2019t resist the temptation, his curved shot looking potent but just missing the mark. Soon after, Nabbout tries to shrug off Jamieson inside the box but can\u2019t shake the defender and the men let each other know not to expect a card this Christmas. 49 mins: Victory win a corner but the ball slingshots to the other end of the pitch, leaving Victory defenders outnumbered. Noone looks threatening on the left but Broxham shuts down the attacking foray with a nicely timed challenge. 46 mins: The second half is under way. It will be interesting to see what changes, if any, the two new coaches make in pursuit of triumph. Or will they be content to lock away the draw and emerge from their first Melbourne derby unscathed? Half-time musing: It might be a 0-0 game to this point, but Victory fans will like this stat: Melbourne Victory scored 31 second-half goals last season, the joint-highest tally in the A-League. Well, both teams have threatened at various stages, and there\u2019s been plenty of perspiration, but inspiration was at a premium in the opening half. On another night, City would be 1-0 up but not tonight after Wales\u2019 miss after 11 minutes. City will be on better terms with themselves at the break but it\u2019s still a goalless affair at Marvel Stadium. 43 mins: Cabrera is released down the right and has a shot on goal, but Traore shows great speed and timing to nullify the threat. Another half chance in a game of half chances. 39 mins: Three corners on the spin for Victory, who look finally to be waking up. The middle corner was the most dangerous and Roux is left with head in hands after his clear shot from close range is tipped over the bar. That\u2019s more like it. 36 mins: Jamieson collects a yellow card after a coming-together with Dobras. The City man isn\u2019t happy but he clearly obstructed Dobras\u2019s path and held his opponent back. 32 mins: Melbourne Victory 0-0 Melbourne City Another chance for City, and Luna has two bites of the cherry, but the most meaningful cannons straight into the chest of the keeper. City look to be gaining the upper hand but, Wales\u2019 clear chance aside, haven\u2019t looked particularly close to scoring. 26 mins: Aside from some flashes at either end from Noone and Nabbout, the match has become something of a grind with neither team taking too many risks. Noone\u2019s corner flies over several Victory heads before being blasted off the line. 21 mins: Another dangerous ball in from Noone is kept out before the first yellow card of the game is awarded to Brillante, who drops Dobras to the ground with a poorly timed challenge. 14 mins: Nabbout showcases his potent threat with a blistering run down the right to earn Victory a corner. City will do well to keep him in check tonight. 11 mins: We now have a new \u2018best chance of the match\u2019 and it really should be 1-0 to City, but it isn\u2019t. Brillante continues his bright start to release Wales with only the keeper to beat, but the low shot zooms past the far post. 8 mins: End-to-end stuff so far, both teams passing expansively and with speed. The best chance of the match goes begging as Delbridge times his challenge perfectly inside the box to thwart Toivonen\u2019s charge. 4 mins: Noone is already asking some questions of Victory on the left, linking well with Brillante and winning the game\u2019s first corner. Nothing comes from it and the ball quickly zips to the other end, where Bouzanis is forced to snuff out a dangerous-looking cross. 1 min: And we are away. City make a watchful beginning, content to pass the ball around before the referee is forced to take some heat out of a rash-looking challenge by Jamieson on Broxham. Nothing in it, really. The clock is ticking, the roof is closed, get ready for the 29th edition of this great derby... And the starting line-ups are in: Melbourne Victory (4-2-3-1): Lawrence Thomas (GK); Storm Roux, James Donachie, Thomas Deng, Adama Traore; Jakob Poulsen, Leigh Broxham; Andrew Nabbout, Kristijan Dobras, Elvis Kamsoba; Ola Toivonen. Subs: Matthew Sutton (GK), Corey Brown, Joshua Hope, Migjen Basha, Benjamin Carrigan, Anthony Lesiotis, Brandon Lauton. Melbourne City (4-3-3): Dean Bouzanis (GK); Scott Galloway, Curtis Good, Harrison Delbridge, Scott Jamieson; Adrian Luna, Joshua Brillante, Connor Metcalfe; Marcelo Cabrera, Lachlan Wales, Craig Noone. Subs: Tom Glover (GK), Rostyn Griffiths, Nathaniel Atkinson, Ramy Najjarine, Moudi Najjar, Richard Windbichler, Stefan Colakovski. Over at Wanderland, sorry Bankwest Stadium, Mitchell Duke cancelled Milan Duric\u2019s awesome first-half strike before Duke won it for the Wanderers from the penalty spot after 82 minutes. And, as if you needed to ask, VAR was to the fore yet again in the adjudication of the handball that led to the penalty. Initially overlooked by the match referee, he was asked to look again and overturned his decision before pointing to the spot. Cue outrage. Cue debate. Cue your peepers to the replay below and make your own mind up. It\u2019s already been an eventful beginning to the new A-League season. Last night, Sydney FC were 3-2 victors over Adelaide United but VAR, as is VAR\u2019s wont, was the centre of attention. The video review system was used to settle three flashpoints and on each occasion looked to get the decisions right, but a little like Cristiano Ronaldo goal celebrations, they took an eternity. This is what Adelaide United coach Gertjan Verbeek had to say: \u201cFive minutes ... to watch if it\u2019s a penalty or not - it\u2019s crazy.\u201d His Sydney FC counterpart, Steve Corica, agreed: \u201cIt is taking a little bit too long. It is what it is, VAR. I think it can work in your favour sometimes and, obviously, not sometimes as well.\u201d Can\u2019t argue with that. Something else that is what it is \u2013 as an aside, can anybody enlighten me as to something that isn\u2019t what it is or is what it isn\u2019t? \u2013 is this ripping A-League season preview by our very own dastardly duo, Richard Parkin and Jonathan Howcroft (and, yes, VAR gets a mention). Evening, sports fans. Isn\u2019t this a nice way to spend your Saturday night. Opening round of the A-League season, the Melbourne derby, an open fire, the undeniable pleasure of my good self for company. Well, three out of four ain\u2019t bad. Enjoy the fire... Onto matters of football, and it really is all change for both Victory and City. It\u2019s hard to guess how they\u2019ll go tonight, let alone over the course of the season. The Victory have certainly been active in the off-season, with prodigal sons Adama Traore, Robbie Kruse and Andrew Nabbout among several additions to the playing roster. Kruse is hamstrung and is a non-starter tonight, while for City Jamie Maclaren and Denis Genreau are both unavailable due to international duty. We can forgive Jamie his absence.

A 59-year-old man sustained stab wounds to his hand and palm and a 19-year-old woman received injuries to her arm and armpit which required surgery during the incident on Friday morning. Another 19-year-old woman suffered a cut to her elbow, a 33-year-old woman a cut to her stomach and a 43-year-old woman was assessed by medics but appeared uninjured. Armed officers were on the scene within five minutes and arrested a 40-year-old man on suspicion of terrorism offences before he was later compulsorily detained under the Mental Health Act.

Grouped around the dining table in his apartment in Berlin\u2019s central Mitte district are three velvet armchairs the interior architect salvaged from what he calls the \u201cHonecker lounge\u201d at East Germany\u2019s State Council Building, moulded over time by the well-nourished bottoms of Soviet apparatchiks. The table itself was formerly a conference table at Berlin\u2019s Evangelical Academy, and if you look under the table top you realise the short legs are propped up on some old-fashioned metal money boxes, like a piece of concept art. \u201cI\u2019ve always wondered why this table is so low,\u201d P\u00f6ppler says as he strolls through his apartment on sunny autumn morning. \u201cOne theory is that the Protestant church didn\u2019t want people in important meetings to be able to hide behind the furniture. Isn\u2019t that a beautiful idea?\u201d</p> <p>P\u00f6ppler, whose practice usually designs and builds living spaces for other people, lives in an apartment that not only speaks of his love for the ideas behind everyday objects, but also doubles as a museum of the German capital\u2019s tumultuous history.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4e7005493827cf5dcdc2fbb1cbb6e38a4fc66f8e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4e7005493827cf5dcdc2fbb1cbb6e38a4fc66f8e/0_256_3796_4741/801.jpg\" alt=\"The kitchen\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The kitchen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wolfgang Stahr/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Originally from outside Bremen, in the north of Germany, P\u00f6ppler arrived in Berlin in autumn 1989, when the city was still divided. At the time, living space was hard to find in the western half, and the young architecture student spent weeks roaming the streets, ringing doorbells to see if tenants would let him explore and admire their buildings. \u201cAs a student, it felt as if there was a point when I knew every house in Berlin.\u201d</p> <p>Two months after his arrival, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/berlinwall\" title=\"\">Berlin Wall fell</a>, opening up swathes of new territory to the architectural magpie\u2019s searching mind. In 1995, P\u00f6ppler found this 150 sq m apartment, in a tenement building from the 1890s, not far from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/24/berlin-crisis-standoff-checkpoint-charlie\" title=\"\">Checkpoint Charlie</a> border-crossing. Partly derelict, the building had been earmarked to be torn down and replaced by a <em>Plattenbau</em> (concrete prefab) like the one on the opposite side of the road. There was no central heating, only a coal-burning oven that required constant attention \u2013 \u201ca bit like looking after a dog\u201d. But P\u00f6ppler and his partner took the plunge.</p> <p>The interior of the average Berlin <em>altbau</em> (period) apartment is pared back: for years the prevailing fashion was to leave walls white and let the battered herringbone parquet or the period plastering on the ceiling serve as the sole adornment. \u201cFor ages, even sofas were considered too bourgeois,\u201d P\u00f6ppler says .</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"727b2ebf33d16af03ad77b7fd8c61196f9c1fd1a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/727b2ebf33d16af03ad77b7fd8c61196f9c1fd1a/0_508_6093_7616/800.jpg\" alt=\"The hall, with the pink tailor\u2019s table.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The hall, with pink tailor\u2019s table.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wolfgang Stahr/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Entering his second-floor apartment is an entirely different experience: the entrance hall\u2019s walls wash over you in a warm Wedgwood blue, the ceiling glimmers with a hint of masking-tape yellow.

      "bodyText": "Whenever Gisbert P\u00f6ppler has people over for dinner, the ghosts of Berlin\u2019s past are guests of honour. Grouped around the dining table in his apartment in Berlin\u2019s central Mitte district are three velvet armchairs the interior architect salvaged from what he calls the \u201cHonecker lounge\u201d at East Germany\u2019s State Council Building, moulded over time by the well-nourished bottoms of Soviet apparatchiks. The table itself was formerly a conference table at Berlin\u2019s Evangelical Academy, and if you look under the table top you realise the short legs are propped up on some old-fashioned metal money boxes, like a piece of concept art. \u201cI\u2019ve always wondered why this table is so low,\u201d P\u00f6ppler says as he strolls through his apartment on sunny autumn morning. \u201cOne theory is that the Protestant church didn\u2019t want people in important meetings to be able to hide behind the furniture. Isn\u2019t that a beautiful idea?\u201d P\u00f6ppler, whose practice usually designs and builds living spaces for other people, lives in an apartment that not only speaks of his love for the ideas behind everyday objects, but also doubles as a museum of the German capital\u2019s tumultuous history. Originally from outside Bremen, in the north of Germany, P\u00f6ppler arrived in Berlin in autumn 1989, when the city was still divided. At the time, living space was hard to find in the western half, and the young architecture student spent weeks roaming the streets, ringing doorbells to see if tenants would let him explore and admire their buildings. \u201cAs a student, it felt as if there was a point when I knew every house in Berlin.\u201d Two months after his arrival, the Berlin Wall fell, opening up swathes of new territory to the architectural magpie\u2019s searching mind. In 1995, P\u00f6ppler found this 150 sq m apartment, in a tenement building from the 1890s, not far from the Checkpoint Charlie border-crossing. Partly derelict, the building had been earmarked to be torn down and replaced by a Plattenbau (concrete prefab) like the one on the opposite side of the road. There was no central heating, only a coal-burning oven that required constant attention \u2013 \u201ca bit like looking after a dog\u201d. But P\u00f6ppler and his partner took the plunge. The interior of the average Berlin altbau (period) apartment is pared back: for years the prevailing fashion was to leave walls white and let the battered herringbone parquet or the period plastering on the ceiling serve as the sole adornment. \u201cFor ages, even sofas were considered too bourgeois,\u201d P\u00f6ppler says . Entering his second-floor apartment is an entirely different experience: the entrance hall\u2019s walls wash over you in a warm Wedgwood blue, the ceiling glimmers with a hint of masking-tape yellow. A dusty pink table P\u00f6ppler picked up from a tailor in West Berlin greets the visitor coquettishly. In the living room to the left, there are explosions of colour: a Chinese export carpet from the 1920s, and a collection of abstract paintings by Hans Brosch, an East German painter who used a study trip to the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay in Paris to escape to the west in 1979. Raised in a family home in \u201cshades of beige and black\u201d, P\u00f6ppler has made use of colour his practice\u2019s signature, though he insists there is no underlying theory behind his choices, just instinct. He\u2019s not a fan of the trend for Farrow &amp; Ball-style British paints, because they tend to be \u201cquite foggy\u201d, preferring instead French manufacturers, which he says pack more of a punch. One characteristic feature of 19th-century tenement buildings in the city is the so-called Berliner Zimmer, an awkward, often dark room that connects the street-facing part of the apartment with the inner courtyard behind, once decried by Friedrich Engels as a \u201chaven of darkness, stale air and Berlin philistinism\u201d. But in P\u00f6ppler\u2019s apartment, the Prussian cobwebs are blown away by an almost baroque gusto for playful design ideas. In his Berliner Zimmer, the flat\u2019s kitchen, a vintage cabinet he has \u201cdragged around since I was 14\u201d hangs next to an artwork made out of salad forks with deer-antler handles, assembled by his long-term American associate Remo Lotano. In the adjacent bedroom, a central ceiling lamp is replaced by four coloured lights in each corner of the room. A stuffed jay peers down from its perch above the doorway. Stories from Berlin\u2019s past reveal themselves only as you enter a room for a second or third time: there is the garden table on the courtyard terrace that P\u00f6ppler found on the street in Prenzlauer Berg, bent out of shape by the weather and riddled with worm holes.

While the Trump presidency has been defined by deep relaxation about the behaviour of Russia, the heyday of Stallone and Schwarzenegger came in a far more hawkish context. The public face of the 80s cold war was a deathmatch, Ronald Reagan\u2019s talk of a Soviet \u201cevil empire\u201d inspiring Stallone to scale down superpowers into action figures and crank up the anti-communism. In <em>Rocky IV</em>, slablike heavyweight Ivan Drago (played by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/dec/19/this-much-know-dolph-lundgren\" title=\"\">Dolph Lundgren</a>) stood in for the Politburo. And then there was Rambo, a character Stallone first played in 1982 in a film about a jobless Vietnam vet hounded in smalltown America. By 1985, he remade him as an avatar of US martial honour, freeing lost prisoners of war from Vietnamese sadists, their Soviet masters and treacherous American bureaucrats.

Audibly non-native, his US breakthrough came as the bad guy, Terminator, the villain of the original film.

In 1988, a third Rambo film saw Stallone join forces with the mujahideen in Soviet occupied Afghanistan. In the same year, Schwarzenegger played a Russian police captain (\u201cIvan Danko\u201d) seconded to Chicago in cop movie <em>Red Heat</em>. It was the first US film to ever shoot in Red Square, a tiny omen of seismic change. A year later, the Berlin Wall fell. A hundred miles away in Dresden, KGB officer Vladimir Putin called his superiors. \u201cMoscow is silent,\u201d he was told. The cold war had been won and lost.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Schwarzengger publicly stands with Greta Thunberg. In rightwing online forums, he is notably less popular than Stallone</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But the spoils of victory can be uncertain. For Stallone, life without anticommunism became a wilderness of regrettable comedies, defanged action movies and vanishing box office receipts. Schwarzenegger had a better 90s, beginning the decade with a vastly popular <em>Terminator</em> sequel, <em>Judgment Day </em>(1991), in which he was reprogrammed to befriend America. For him too, however, changing times finally prevailed. In 2003, Stallone made a cameo in <em>Spy Kids 3D: Game Over</em> then disappeared. The same year, Schwarzenegger segued from promoting the third Terminator movie, <em>Rise of the Machines</em>, into a successful campaign to become governor of California, accepted into the mainstream of professional US politics.</p> <p>How a pair of ageing he-men who effectively retired 16 years ago ended up back in cold war costume is a story that begins with Iraq and Afghanistan. You might think the last thing US audiences wanted was more mayhem overseas. In fact, Stallone intuited that they were wholly ready for a comforting vision of American violence as just and viciously efficient. A fourth Rambo movie arrived in 2008, its hero deployed far from Afghanistan to eviscerate junta troops in Myanmar. But the old MO remained \u2013 an inhuman foreign foe and all the fake blood in the shop.</p> <p>Then came the crash of 2008. Two years later, Stallone released <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/feb/09/film-recap-sylvester-stallone-the-expendables\" title=\"\">The Expendables</a></em>, the first of a three-film series in which he starred at the centre of a medley of superannuated action heroes. If 20 years as cold war victors had failed to provide a happier ending than Iraq and Lehman Brothers, these were movies by men from a past waiting to be rebooted \u2013 good guys from the old world. It was Make America Great Again before Trump. The films grossed more than $800m.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8784b3c020e5bea3aa7f3d35e53fce9dd55aabd0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8784b3c020e5bea3aa7f3d35e53fce9dd55aabd0/0_161_3569_2142/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stallone in Rambo: First Blood Part II.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Musclebound relic \u2026 Sylvester Stallone in <em>Rambo: First Blood Part II.</em></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ronald Grant</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Even Schwarzenegger joined him. He may not have planned to return to movies, but his time as California governor ended with his Bush-era conservatism about to plunge from fashion in Republican circles. Under Trump, tax cuts for the rich endured \u2013 but all the attention went to Rambo-ish displays of nativist rage. Schwarzengger rebranded as a moderate. Now, while his once monstrous Terminator prepares to defend humankind again, the actor publicly stands with Greta Thunberg. In rightwing online forums, he is notably less popular than Stallone.</p> <p>History has a way with a plot twist. Thirty years after his sombre phone call in Dresden, Putin could now plausibly claim victory in the post-cold war. Leaders of a fractured west treat him as a role model, none more so than the US president. But elsewhere, old stories repeat themselves. For his most recent Rambo, Stallone turned to a more primal US fear \u2013 Mexico, the site of Trump\u2019s most vivid terror, migrant \u201ccaravans\u201d trekking north from countries such as El Salvador, Nicaragua and Guatemala. Here too, the long aftershock of the American 80s lives on.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Rambo: Last Blood is on general release; Terminator: Dark Fate is out on 23 October.</em></p>",

Schwarzenegger had a better 90s, beginning the decade with a vastly popular Terminator sequel, Judgment Day (1991), in which he was reprogrammed to befriend America. For him too, however, changing times finally prevailed. In 2003, Stallone made a cameo in Spy Kids 3D: Game Over then disappeared. The same year, Schwarzenegger segued from promoting the third Terminator movie, Rise of the Machines, into a successful campaign to become governor of California, accepted into the mainstream of professional US politics. How a pair of ageing he-men who effectively retired 16 years ago ended up back in cold war costume is a story that begins with Iraq and Afghanistan. You might think the last thing US audiences wanted was more mayhem overseas. In fact, Stallone intuited that they were wholly ready for a comforting vision of American violence as just and viciously efficient. A fourth Rambo movie arrived in 2008, its hero deployed far from Afghanistan to eviscerate junta troops in Myanmar. But the old MO remained \u2013 an inhuman foreign foe and all the fake blood in the shop. Then came the crash of 2008. Two years later, Stallone released The Expendables, the first of a three-film series in which he starred at the centre of a medley of superannuated action heroes. If 20 years as cold war victors had failed to provide a happier ending than Iraq and Lehman Brothers, these were movies by men from a past waiting to be rebooted \u2013 good guys from the old world. It was Make America Great Again before Trump. The films grossed more than $800m. Even Schwarzenegger joined him. He may not have planned to return to movies, but his time as California governor ended with his Bush-era conservatism about to plunge from fashion in Republican circles. Under Trump, tax cuts for the rich endured \u2013 but all the attention went to Rambo-ish displays of nativist rage. Schwarzengger rebranded as a moderate. Now, while his once monstrous Terminator prepares to defend humankind again, the actor publicly stands with Greta Thunberg. In rightwing online forums, he is notably less popular than Stallone. History has a way with a plot twist. Thirty years after his sombre phone call in Dresden, Putin could now plausibly claim victory in the post-cold war. Leaders of a fractured west treat him as a role model, none more so than the US president. But elsewhere, old stories repeat themselves. For his most recent Rambo, Stallone turned to a more primal US fear \u2013 Mexico, the site of Trump\u2019s most vivid terror, migrant \u201ccaravans\u201d trekking north from countries such as El Salvador, Nicaragua and Guatemala. Here too, the long aftershock of the American 80s lives on. \u2022 Rambo: Last Blood is on general release; Terminator: Dark Fate is out on 23 October.",

      "body": "<p>In the story behind the story of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/harvey-weinstein\" title=\"\">Harvey Weinstein</a>\u2019s fall from grace, there is a large portion devoted to how the movie producer tried to silence reporting of the allegations against him. For Ronan Farrow, whose investigation for the New Yorker won him a Pulitzer prize in 2018, the effect was paranoia-inducing. He was convinced he was being followed; he thought his phone had been hacked. At one point, he opened a safety deposit box in a vault beneath a branch of Bank of America, and placed in it transcripts of interviews with dozens of sources and a flash drive containing incriminating audio. On top of the pile, he left a note with instructions on whom to contact \u201cshould anything happen to me\u201d, and the entreaty: \u201cPlease make sure this information is released.\u201d</p> <p>As it turned out, the surveillance was real, and the threat of legal action constant. The pressure on everyone involved was so intense that, prior to publication of Farrow\u2019s new book, Catch And Kill, he spent so long on the phone with a New Yorker factchecker called Sean, that Sean \u201cgot a stress nosebleed\u201d.</p> <p>We meet in Farrow\u2019s publisher\u2019s office in midtown Manhattan, where the 31-year-old is hastily eating between meetings. When the Weinstein story broke, Farrow was not an anonymous byline; arguably, he was as well known as the producer himself. His parents are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/mia-farrow\" title=\"\">Mia Farrow</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/woodyallen\" title=\"\">Woody Allen</a>, and the speculation about their relationship went back decades \u2013 as did the controversy around the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/feb/02/dylan-farrow-woody-allen-abuse-allegations\" title=\"\">sexual abuse allegations made by Dylan</a>, Farrow\u2019s older sister, against their father. During the course of the investigation, Weinstein would weaponise all of this to try to unnerve him.</p> <p>If Farrow was intimidated, it isn\u2019t his style to show it: he is amused, sardonic, diminutive, in a way that invites comparisons to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/truman-capote\" title=\"\">Truman Capote</a>; and, unlike most reporters, highly socially at ease. He is also run ragged. During the Weinstein investigations and others that followed \u2013 primarily Farrow\u2019s reporting on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/nov/30/matt-lauer-ashamed-and-embarrassed-by-reports-of-sexual-misconduct\" title=\"\">Matt Lauer</a>, the former NBC host accused of sexual harassment, about whom the book contains explosive new allegations \u2013 Farrow forgot to eat, go out except when following leads, or call his boyfriend in LA. For a while, he says, it was like being, \u201cthe homicide beat detective fixated on the one that got away\u201d.</p> <p>Catch And Kill is a very different book from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/18/she-said-by-jodi-cantor-and-megan-twohey-weinstein\" title=\"\">She Said</a>, the recent account of the Weinstein investigation written by Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey, the New York Times reporters with whom Farrow shares his Pulitzer prize. She Said is a sober, dispassionate, intensely moving piece of reconstructed reporting, into which the journalists\u2019 home lives do not intrude. Farrow, while as diligent in his reporting, permits himself some licence, the spare voice of his New Yorker articles giving way to something livelier and more personal. The book is darkly funny and poignant, featuring cameos by Jonathan Lovett \u2013 his long-suffering partner, and a podcaster and former presidential speechwriter \u2013 and Mia Farrow, his mother. If it veers occasionally into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/tomwolfe\" title=\"\">Tom Wolfe</a> territory \u2013 a literary production too nakedly charmed by itself \u2013 it remains a winning account of how it feels to be at the centre of the biggest story in the world. It is also, of course, a breathtakingly dogged piece of reporting, in the face of extraordinary opposition. \u201cThe book was an opportunity, yes, to report on brand new leads \u2013 there are new revelations there,\u201d Farrow says. \u201cBut also to immerse a person in what it\u2019s like to follow the clues.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9940bfa7f2269b6f1878bbf4311a26e704d1e1ff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9940bfa7f2269b6f1878bbf4311a26e704d1e1ff/0_101_4752_3138/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ronan Farrow interviewing Ambra Battilana Gutierrez, who helped expose the Weinstein allegations\" width=\"1000\" height=\"660\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Interviewing Ambra Battilana Gutierrez, who helped expose the Weinstein allegations. Photograph: Getty Images</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Angela Weiss/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Initially, Farrow had more success than Kantor and Twohey at persuading actresses with allegations to go on the record: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/mira-sorvino\" title=\"\">Mira Sorvino</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/asia-argento\" title=\"\">Asia Argento</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/aug/26/rosanna-arquette-they-said-i-was-a-pain-in-the-ass-its-not-true\" title=\"\">Ros</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/aug/26/rosanna-arquette-they-said-i-was-a-pain-in-the-ass-its-not-true\" title=\"\">anna Arquette</a> all spoke to him about their experiences with Weinstein. One assumes Farrow was assisted in this by his background \u2013 he is a brilliant reporter, but he is also a creature of Hollywood and less subject, perhaps, to the natural suspicion that exists between celebrities and hacks \u2013 as well as, possibly, by his sexuality.</p> <p>\u201cI think it was absolutely part of the dynamic,\u201d he says. \u201cEach of us as journalists brings who we are to the table and, in the case of stories about sexual violence, you\u2019re asking people to talk about something that is so invasive and personal, and is about their bodies, and involves recounting in forensic detail these clinical things that are freighted with layers of shame and embarrassment. I think the fact I was not your classic straight guy, coming at it in a way where there was any concern about a leering element, helped in those conversations. I was able to use that to create a space where people felt comfortable.\u201d</p> <p>Farrow also had a history of reporting on sexual violence. Decades earlier, Dylan Farrow had accused Woody Allen of molesting her when she was seven. An investigation was dropped, but the allegations, which Allen has always denied, lingered. A year before he began investigating Weinstein, Farrow had defended his sister in print and gone on, very vocally, to support her.</p> <p>His reporting on Weinstein began at NBC, the American TV network. By the time Farrow took the story to the New Yorker, he had a growing witness list, several bombshell interviews, and the smoking gun of a secretly taped conversation acquired by an Italian model called Ambra Battilana Gutierrez; in 2015, Gutierrez had worn a wire for an NYPD investigation into Weinstein and had audio of him harassing her and confessing to groping her. (The Manhattan district attorney had decided not to press charges.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"006216b9da830a71a7955c6f883ed5f17933c667\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/006216b9da830a71a7955c6f883ed5f17933c667/0_54_2621_1937/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ronan Farrow as a baby with his parents Mia Farrow and Woody Allen, and his sister Dylan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"739\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">As a baby with parents Mia Farrow and Woody Allen, and sister Dylan. Photograph: Getty Images</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David McGough/The LIFE Picture Collection via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Farrow believes there are two reasons why NBC first encouraged, and later, he alleges, ordered him to drop the story. (NBC denies this allegation.) The first, he says, was pressure from Weinstein who, through a combination of legal and other threats (to withhold interviews with the stars of his films, for example), manipulated members of upper management, including Farrow\u2019s boss, head of news Noah Oppenheim. Farrow quotes a conversation that he says took place between Andy Lack, the head of the network, and Weinstein, in which the movie producer said that, if he slept with people he shouldn\u2019t have, \u201cit was the 90s, Andy. We all did that.\u201d Lack replied, \u201cHarvey, say no more. We\u2019ll look into it.\u201d (Precisely how Farrow was able to reproduce this conversation remains obscure, though that seems to be a necessary measure undertaken to protect sources, and the book has been fact-checked to New Yorker standards. A note states: \u201cBecause this is a story about surveillance, third parties often witnessed or surreptitiously recorded conversations, and I was sometimes able to obtain their testimonials and records.\u201d) There is an unmistakable sense, reading Farrow\u2019s book, of powerful men \u2013 and sometimes women \u2013 looking out for each other without much need for further incentive.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I went out of my way to convey that the way women are silenced doesn\u2019t always look like moustache-twirling villainy</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The second reason NBC cooled on the story, Farrow believes, \u201cis just baseline casual misogyny. And misogyny is a very damning word, but actually it looks quite banal a lot of the time: it\u2019s not believing that it\u2019s an issue that matters. Before the Weinstein story broke, there were people out there in the world who had lived this and seen the machine that shuts these stories down, and understood that it was a big story waiting to happen. But there were a lot of others who, informed by a whole lot of cultural and identity factors, just didn\u2019t care, and didn\u2019t think anyone else would ever care.\u201d</p> <p>Lack would later put out a memo disparaging Farrow\u2019s reporting about Weinstein, stating that he, \u201cnever had a victim or witness willing to be identified\u201d. This was not, Farrow writes, \u201ctrue of any point in the lifespan of the story at NBC\u201d. He resigned, and published his first piece on Weinstein in the New Yorker on 10 October 2017. Six months later, Weinstein was arrested and released on $1m bail. He is due to stand trial on multiple charges of predatory sexual assault and rape in January.</p> <p>You don\u2019t, Farrow says, have to believe in vast conspiracy theories to understand why the story got stuck. When writing the book, he says, \u201cI went out of my way to try to convey that the way in which people, and particularly women, with these kinds of claims are silenced doesn\u2019t always look like moustache-twirling villainy.\u201d Instead, he says, \u201cIt\u2019s people who think of themselves as being reasonable and compassionate, and very often liberal, acquiescing and becoming examples of moral cowardice \u2013 because that\u2019s their cost\u2011benefit analysis.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>In the early stages of his reporting career, it\u2019s safe to say Ronan Farrow wasn\u2019t taken particularly seriously. He was very blond, very confident, the child of celebrities, who, in spite of a law degree from Yale, a DPhil from Oxford and a period working as a junior official in Hillary Clinton\u2019s state department, still had a whiff of showbiz about him. In June 2016, when he pitched an item to Noah Oppenheim called The Dark Side of Hollywood?, Farrow was in a tricky place: his show Ronan Farrow Daily had been cancelled; he was back to hot-desking at NBC, and woefully behind on a book deadline. On top of that, he was recovering, once again, from intense media interest in his family.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"64123adfc789b14e07a16553b396207fa4715730\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/64123adfc789b14e07a16553b396207fa4715730/222_76_2778_2119/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Woody Allen with Harvey Weinstein in\u00a02008\" width=\"1000\" height=\"763\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Allen with Weinstein in 2008.

(They resurfaced in 2016, in response to a glowing profile of Allen in the Hollywood Reporter.) A common view was that, while Allen was probably a creep, Mia was completely unglued on this subject after an ugly separation, while Farrow\u2019s support of his sister was overblown. This may well have been the case; Farrow admits that, far from having championed Dylan from the outset, for a long time he had resented her for not letting everyone in the family move on. His public support in 2016 was an effort to make amends.</p> <p>Dylan is a constant, background presence in Catch And Kill. Farrow calls her for advice on how to talk to a reluctant witness (\u201cJust tell her to hang tough,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s like ripping off a Band-Aid\u201d), and to ask her if he is doing the right thing. Better than anyone, perhaps, he understood how little tolerance people have for allegations of sexual assault; how annoyed and fatigued they get; how hard it is to make these things stick.</p> <p>\u201cThat is exactly the reality,\u201d he says. \u201cEvery story I do, there is some effort to suggest that I\u2019m not impartial, and in the Weinstein story, the personal background I had was used against me, time and time again.\u201d The producer wrote to Farrow\u2019s editors telling them he was an unreliable witness, motivated by revenge: Weinstein was Woody Allen\u2019s distributor. \u201cAnd far from that spurious claim that I had entrenched sympathies because of my sister\u2019s experiences, it was the opposite: I was the guy telling her to shut up.\u201d</p> <p>You had been a bit of a dick.</p> <p>\u201cRight. I had been a bit of a dick. I think that\u2019s quite accurate. And I had to go through the journey that I think the culture has gone through, of being dragged to the conclusion that these are serious crimes that are being covered up, and that we need to talk about it more.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Weinstein called Allen for advice on how to stop the story and handle his son. \u2018Allen shut down the idea,\u2019 Farrow says</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The accusations of partiality were levelled at Farrow in one of many extraordinary legal threats sent by Weinstein to the New Yorker, part of a pattern of intimidation that included putting private detectives on his tail and trying to trap him with false friends and witnesses. (They worked for a private Israeli intelligence outfit called Black Cube; a whistleblower at the company would later leak the contract to Farrow.) A woman called \u201cDiana Filip\u201d, who introduced herself by email as a wealth manager organising a women\u2019s rights conference, turned out to have been hired by Weinstein\u2019s investigators \u2013 not only to gather information on Farrow, but to befriend and extract information from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/rose-mcgowan\" title=\"\">Rose McGowan</a>. Farrow discovered that a journalist called Ben Wallace, who had been investigating Weinstein for New York magazine, had been approached by a woman called \u201cAnna\u201d, who claimed to have been assaulted by the producer. She turned out not only to be a private investigator, but the same private investigator who played \u201cDiana Filip\u201d. Meanwhile, two more detectives sat in a car outside Farrow\u2019s apartment. </p> <p>And the legal threats continued to pour in. Weinstein\u2019s lawyer warned that, while Farrow was \u201centitled to his private anger\u2026 no publisher should allow those personal feelings to create and pursue a baseless and defamatory story from his personal animus\u201d. He went on to suggest that Farrow had been brainwashed into finding Dylan\u2019s claim credible, and to cite, with stunning irrelevance, the fact that Farrow\u2019s uncle had been \u201csentenced to 10 years in prison for sexually abusing two boys. We have yet to find any evidence that Ronan Farrow has publicly denounced his uncle, and he might have publicly supported him.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"978596e04301c16b8ee7c47f729af2b0500066aa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/978596e04301c16b8ee7c47f729af2b0500066aa/850_367_1993_2328/856.jpg\" alt=\"Jon Lovett (L) and Ronan Farrow at the 2019 Vanity Fair Oscar Party, February 2019, in Beverly Hills, California.\" width=\"856\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With partner Jonathan Lovett. Photograph: WireImage</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Emma McIntyre/VF19/WireImage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Farrow smiles at the mention of the uncle. \u201cIt was almost absurdist to the point of theatre,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what to make of it. But it was also quite lacerating on a personal level, because you\u2019re working so hard to do a meticulous and fair reporting job, and then suddenly all of these issues that have nothing to do with it \u2013 and that are personal and painful \u2013 are being thrown at you, like my sister\u2019s assault. It\u2019s a dirty move.\u201d</p> <p>Further dirty moves followed. Astonishingly, Farrow suggests that at one point Weinstein called Woody Allen for advice, not only on how to stop the story, but on how to handle Farrow. \u201cHe wanted to know if Allen would intercede on his behalf. Allen shut down the idea,\u201d Farrow writes. (He is estranged from his father, to whom he refers by his surname.) But at the end of the call, Farrow quotes Allen saying to Weinstein, \u201cJeez, I\u2019m so sorry. Good luck.\u201d</p> <p>Most of the threats were theatrical and ludicrous; at one stage, Weinstein said to Farrow, in a line that would have been cut from a script for being too cheesy: \u201cYou couldn\u2019t save someone you love, and now you think you can save everyone.\u201d Meanwhile, Weinstein\u2019s connections in New York and Washington DC seemed to leave Farrow no safe port of call. One of Weinstein\u2019s fixers, Jack Palladino, hired to gather potentially harmful information on Farrow, had once worked for the Clintons; Weinstein\u2019s lawyer, David Boies, had deep connections in the liberal media; as did Lisa Bloom, the former champion of women\u2019s rights who represented Weinstein in the early stages of the investigation. (Bloom has since been thoroughly disgraced following publication of a memo in which she shared her strategy for undermining McGowan: \u201cI feel equipped to help you against the Roses of the world, because I have represented so many of them.\u201d) For a while, everywhere Farrow looked, he saw Weinstein.</p> <p>\u201cYou start to realise that if you are wealthy enough and connected enough, you can hire secret agents with false identities, and honeypots to seduce people, and engage in cyberhacking to try to track someone\u2019s location. This is a whole underbelly of what the wealthy and powerful do if they are in a corner,\u201d Farrow says. \u201cAnd just the gap between the tools available to men like Harvey Weinstein, and those available to any one of the sources in those stories, was incredibly upsetting to witness.\u201d</p> <p>I tell him I recently noticed a headline in the New York Post referring to Ally Canosa, an event planner and former Weinstein employee who spoke to Farrow, alleging that Weinstein sexually assaulted her multiple times and raped her in a hotel room. \u201cWeinstein accuser sent affectionate emails after alleged sex attack,\u201d ran the headline, followed by a piece effectively trashing Canosa. Is it possible that, even while he is out on bail, Weinstein\u2019s manipulations are ongoing?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e128d869821661afc51e3e3ae0fa5859e9dcbe7a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e128d869821661afc51e3e3ae0fa5859e9dcbe7a/0_397_5952_3571/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Actress, musician and feminist campaigner, Rose McGowan, photographed at the Barbican, London, 15th May 2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We interrogated her claims really, really hard,\u2019 Farrow says of Rose McGowan. \u2018She is very credible.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Lee/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThey are without a doubt still ongoing,\u201d Farrow says. \u201cAnd there are a number of subjects reported on in this book \u2013 I\u2019m trying to vague this up, so I\u2019m not talking about anyone [specific] \u2013 who are this very week planting pieces of spin about crimes that I report on, to try to get ahead of it in a way that is so demeaning and damaging to the women involved. And the fact that there is still a media infrastructure that supports that is something we should all take a hard look at.\u201d</p> <p>The book\u2019s big scoop involves Farrow\u2019s former NBC colleague, the TV host Matt Lauer, who was fired from the network in 2017 for \u201cinappropriate sexual behaviour\u201d. At the time, the allegations made against him by a woman at the network were characterised by NBC as an extramarital affair gone awry; neither \u201ccriminal\u201d nor \u201can assault\u201d. According to Farrow, who names the woman as Brooke Nevils, a young production assistant, what allegedly happened meets the definition of rape. In an extraordinary scene towards the end of the book, based on the account Nevils gave Farrow, she goes to Lauer\u2019s hotel room while the pair are reporting on the Sochi Winter Olympics in 2014, and he anally rapes her. \u201cShe said that she declined several times, replying, at one point, \u2018No, that\u2019s not my thing,\u2019\u201d Farrow writes. \u201cNevils said that she was still in the midst of telling him she wasn\u2019t interested when he \u2018just did it\u2019. Lauer denies that anything non-consensual occurred, then or later, between him and Nevils.</p> <p>At the heart of this episode is the question of coercion; Nevils, Canosa and most of the women in Farrow\u2019s book are undermined by the men they\u2019re accusing on the basis that they maintained contact after they were allegedly attacked. \u201cIt\u2019s this fundamental misapprehension about the nature of sexual violence,\u201d Farrow says, \u201cthat it plays out in a context where you would never have any contact again. Very often it plays out because people are vulnerable to those they work with, those in their families, those they can\u2019t avoid seeing again.\u201d Meanwhile, the idea that women who report sexual harassment have something to gain by it \u2013 that losing their jobs, reputations and more often than not their self-esteem is just grist for shaking down wealthy men \u2013 continues to prosper.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c583a5500820ff79840e90709735b61e6b4014ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c583a5500820ff79840e90709735b61e6b4014ae/217_57_3524_2799/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Actor Mia Farrow, recipient of the ELLE Legend Award, poses with her son, journalist Ronan Farrow, at the 25th Annual ELLE Women in Hollywood Celebration, Monday, Oct 15, 2018\" width=\"1000\" height=\"794\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With his mother last year. Photograph: AP</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One comes back to the fact that it\u2019s not the crime, it\u2019s the cover-up; that the most shocking aspect of the stories broken by Farrow and his colleagues is not the alleged assaults, but the systems that allow and perpetuate them. Patient zero in both the New York Times and Farrow\u2019s reporting was McGowan, the actor who had for years been making allegations that Weinstein had raped her at the Sundance film festival in 1997. Weinstein\u2019s spin machine went after her hard, briefing against her to journalists, characterising her as \u201ccrazy\u201d and an unreliable witness. It worked. I tell Farrow that, more than once while discussing Weinstein in the early stages of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/metoo-movement\" title=\"\">#MeToo movement</a>, I heard myself say, \u201cRose McGowan sounds pretty nuts,\u201d in an echo of the language once used about Mia Farrow.</p> <p>\u201cRose McGowan, as it turns out, is very credible,\u201d Farrow says. \u201cThe claims she has made have checked out. She has not made a spurious accusation that I\u2019m aware of. She recounted details that eye witnesses at the time backed up and that documents backed up. Her personality is neither here nor there. To all of these men who were saying, \u2018Oh, but she\u2019s too crazy\u2019, I would say we interrogated her claims really, really hard. She\u2019s a great example of that dichotomy \u2013 of how sometimes, when people have sustained a lot of emotional damage and behave in a way that reflects that, they open themselves up to that criticism, particularly if they\u2019re women. It becomes a cudgel that\u2019s used to dismiss them.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/14/fixing-tattered-reputation-like-harvey-weinsteins-dirty-work-pays-well\">Fixing a tattered reputation like Harvey Weinstein\u2019s is dirty work, but pays so well | Catherine Bennett</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is a depressing landscape that can, at times, seem to offer no break in the flow of new alleged victims.

      "bodyText": "In the story behind the story of Harvey Weinstein\u2019s fall from grace, there is a large portion devoted to how the movie producer tried to silence reporting of the allegations against him. For Ronan Farrow, whose investigation for the New Yorker won him a Pulitzer prize in 2018, the effect was paranoia-inducing. He was convinced he was being followed; he thought his phone had been hacked. At one point, he opened a safety deposit box in a vault beneath a branch of Bank of America, and placed in it transcripts of interviews with dozens of sources and a flash drive containing incriminating audio. On top of the pile, he left a note with instructions on whom to contact \u201cshould anything happen to me\u201d, and the entreaty: \u201cPlease make sure this information is released.\u201d As it turned out, the surveillance was real, and the threat of legal action constant. The pressure on everyone involved was so intense that, prior to publication of Farrow\u2019s new book, Catch And Kill, he spent so long on the phone with a New Yorker factchecker called Sean, that Sean \u201cgot a stress nosebleed\u201d. We meet in Farrow\u2019s publisher\u2019s office in midtown Manhattan, where the 31-year-old is hastily eating between meetings. When the Weinstein story broke, Farrow was not an anonymous byline; arguably, he was as well known as the producer himself. His parents are Mia Farrow and Woody Allen, and the speculation about their relationship went back decades \u2013 as did the controversy around the sexual abuse allegations made by Dylan, Farrow\u2019s older sister, against their father. During the course of the investigation, Weinstein would weaponise all of this to try to unnerve him. If Farrow was intimidated, it isn\u2019t his style to show it: he is amused, sardonic, diminutive, in a way that invites comparisons to Truman Capote; and, unlike most reporters, highly socially at ease. He is also run ragged. During the Weinstein investigations and others that followed \u2013 primarily Farrow\u2019s reporting on Matt Lauer, the former NBC host accused of sexual harassment, about whom the book contains explosive new allegations \u2013 Farrow forgot to eat, go out except when following leads, or call his boyfriend in LA. For a while, he says, it was like being, \u201cthe homicide beat detective fixated on the one that got away\u201d. Catch And Kill is a very different book from She Said, the recent account of the Weinstein investigation written by Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey, the New York Times reporters with whom Farrow shares his Pulitzer prize. She Said is a sober, dispassionate, intensely moving piece of reconstructed reporting, into which the journalists\u2019 home lives do not intrude. Farrow, while as diligent in his reporting, permits himself some licence, the spare voice of his New Yorker articles giving way to something livelier and more personal. The book is darkly funny and poignant, featuring cameos by Jonathan Lovett \u2013 his long-suffering partner, and a podcaster and former presidential speechwriter \u2013 and Mia Farrow, his mother. If it veers occasionally into Tom Wolfe territory \u2013 a literary production too nakedly charmed by itself \u2013 it remains a winning account of how it feels to be at the centre of the biggest story in the world. It is also, of course, a breathtakingly dogged piece of reporting, in the face of extraordinary opposition. \u201cThe book was an opportunity, yes, to report on brand new leads \u2013 there are new revelations there,\u201d Farrow says. \u201cBut also to immerse a person in what it\u2019s like to follow the clues.\u201d Initially, Farrow had more success than Kantor and Twohey at persuading actresses with allegations to go on the record: Mira Sorvino, Asia Argento and Rosanna Arquette all spoke to him about their experiences with Weinstein. One assumes Farrow was assisted in this by his background \u2013 he is a brilliant reporter, but he is also a creature of Hollywood and less subject, perhaps, to the natural suspicion that exists between celebrities and hacks \u2013 as well as, possibly, by his sexuality. \u201cI think it was absolutely part of the dynamic,\u201d he says. \u201cEach of us as journalists brings who we are to the table and, in the case of stories about sexual violence, you\u2019re asking people to talk about something that is so invasive and personal, and is about their bodies, and involves recounting in forensic detail these clinical things that are freighted with layers of shame and embarrassment. I think the fact I was not your classic straight guy, coming at it in a way where there was any concern about a leering element, helped in those conversations. I was able to use that to create a space where people felt comfortable.\u201d Farrow also had a history of reporting on sexual violence. Decades earlier, Dylan Farrow had accused Woody Allen of molesting her when she was seven. An investigation was dropped, but the allegations, which Allen has always denied, lingered. A year before he began investigating Weinstein, Farrow had defended his sister in print and gone on, very vocally, to support her. His reporting on Weinstein began at NBC, the American TV network. By the time Farrow took the story to the New Yorker, he had a growing witness list, several bombshell interviews, and the smoking gun of a secretly taped conversation acquired by an Italian model called Ambra Battilana Gutierrez; in 2015, Gutierrez had worn a wire for an NYPD investigation into Weinstein and had audio of him harassing her and confessing to groping her. (The Manhattan district attorney had decided not to press charges.) Farrow believes there are two reasons why NBC first encouraged, and later, he alleges, ordered him to drop the story. (NBC denies this allegation.) The first, he says, was pressure from Weinstein who, through a combination of legal and other threats (to withhold interviews with the stars of his films, for example), manipulated members of upper management, including Farrow\u2019s boss, head of news Noah Oppenheim. Farrow quotes a conversation that he says took place between Andy Lack, the head of the network, and Weinstein, in which the movie producer said that, if he slept with people he shouldn\u2019t have, \u201cit was the 90s, Andy. We all did that.\u201d Lack replied, \u201cHarvey, say no more. We\u2019ll look into it.\u201d (Precisely how Farrow was able to reproduce this conversation remains obscure, though that seems to be a necessary measure undertaken to protect sources, and the book has been fact-checked to New Yorker standards. A note states: \u201cBecause this is a story about surveillance, third parties often witnessed or surreptitiously recorded conversations, and I was sometimes able to obtain their testimonials and records.\u201d) There is an unmistakable sense, reading Farrow\u2019s book, of powerful men \u2013 and sometimes women \u2013 looking out for each other without much need for further incentive. The second reason NBC cooled on the story, Farrow believes, \u201cis just baseline casual misogyny. And misogyny is a very damning word, but actually it looks quite banal a lot of the time: it\u2019s not believing that it\u2019s an issue that matters. Before the Weinstein story broke, there were people out there in the world who had lived this and seen the machine that shuts these stories down, and understood that it was a big story waiting to happen. But there were a lot of others who, informed by a whole lot of cultural and identity factors, just didn\u2019t care, and didn\u2019t think anyone else would ever care.\u201d Lack would later put out a memo disparaging Farrow\u2019s reporting about Weinstein, stating that he, \u201cnever had a victim or witness willing to be identified\u201d. This was not, Farrow writes, \u201ctrue of any point in the lifespan of the story at NBC\u201d. He resigned, and published his first piece on Weinstein in the New Yorker on 10 October 2017. Six months later, Weinstein was arrested and released on $1m bail. He is due to stand trial on multiple charges of predatory sexual assault and rape in January. You don\u2019t, Farrow says, have to believe in vast conspiracy theories to understand why the story got stuck. When writing the book, he says, \u201cI went out of my way to try to convey that the way in which people, and particularly women, with these kinds of claims are silenced doesn\u2019t always look like moustache-twirling villainy.\u201d Instead, he says, \u201cIt\u2019s people who think of themselves as being reasonable and compassionate, and very often liberal, acquiescing and becoming examples of moral cowardice \u2013 because that\u2019s their cost\u2011benefit analysis.\u201d *** In the early stages of his reporting career, it\u2019s safe to say Ronan Farrow wasn\u2019t taken particularly seriously. He was very blond, very confident, the child of celebrities, who, in spite of a law degree from Yale, a DPhil from Oxford and a period working as a junior official in Hillary Clinton\u2019s state department, still had a whiff of showbiz about him. In June 2016, when he pitched an item to Noah Oppenheim called The Dark Side of Hollywood?, Farrow was in a tricky place: his show Ronan Farrow Daily had been cancelled; he was back to hot-desking at NBC, and woefully behind on a book deadline. On top of that, he was recovering, once again, from intense media interest in his family. Prior to a cultural shift that would come about in part thanks to Farrow\u2019s reporting, the Woody Allen abuse allegations had divided public opinion. (They resurfaced in 2016, in response to a glowing profile of Allen in the Hollywood Reporter.) A common view was that, while Allen was probably a creep, Mia was completely unglued on this subject after an ugly separation, while Farrow\u2019s support of his sister was overblown. This may well have been the case; Farrow admits that, far from having championed Dylan from the outset, for a long time he had resented her for not letting everyone in the family move on. His public support in 2016 was an effort to make amends. Dylan is a constant, background presence in Catch And Kill. Farrow calls her for advice on how to talk to a reluctant witness (\u201cJust tell her to hang tough,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s like ripping off a Band-Aid\u201d), and to ask her if he is doing the right thing. Better than anyone, perhaps, he understood how little tolerance people have for allegations of sexual assault; how annoyed and fatigued they get; how hard it is to make these things stick. \u201cThat is exactly the reality,\u201d he says. \u201cEvery story I do, there is some effort to suggest that I\u2019m not impartial, and in the Weinstein story, the personal background I had was used against me, time and time again.\u201d The producer wrote to Farrow\u2019s editors telling them he was an unreliable witness, motivated by revenge: Weinstein was Woody Allen\u2019s distributor. \u201cAnd far from that spurious claim that I had entrenched sympathies because of my sister\u2019s experiences, it was the opposite: I was the guy telling her to shut up.\u201d You had been a bit of a dick. \u201cRight. I had been a bit of a dick. I think that\u2019s quite accurate. And I had to go through the journey that I think the culture has gone through, of being dragged to the conclusion that these are serious crimes that are being covered up, and that we need to talk about it more.\u201d The accusations of partiality were levelled at Farrow in one of many extraordinary legal threats sent by Weinstein to the New Yorker, part of a pattern of intimidation that included putting private detectives on his tail and trying to trap him with false friends and witnesses. (They worked for a private Israeli intelligence outfit called Black Cube; a whistleblower at the company would later leak the contract to Farrow.) A woman called \u201cDiana Filip\u201d, who introduced herself by email as a wealth manager organising a women\u2019s rights conference, turned out to have been hired by Weinstein\u2019s investigators \u2013 not only to gather information on Farrow, but to befriend and extract information from Rose McGowan. Farrow discovered that a journalist called Ben Wallace, who had been investigating Weinstein for New York magazine, had been approached by a woman called \u201cAnna\u201d, who claimed to have been assaulted by the producer. She turned out not only to be a private investigator, but the same private investigator who played \u201cDiana Filip\u201d. Meanwhile, two more detectives sat in a car outside Farrow\u2019s apartment. And the legal threats continued to pour in. Weinstein\u2019s lawyer warned that, while Farrow was \u201centitled to his private anger\u2026 no publisher should allow those personal feelings to create and pursue a baseless and defamatory story from his personal animus\u201d. He went on to suggest that Farrow had been brainwashed into finding Dylan\u2019s claim credible, and to cite, with stunning irrelevance, the fact that Farrow\u2019s uncle had been \u201csentenced to 10 years in prison for sexually abusing two boys. We have yet to find any evidence that Ronan Farrow has publicly denounced his uncle, and he might have publicly supported him.\u201d Farrow smiles at the mention of the uncle. \u201cIt was almost absurdist to the point of theatre,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what to make of it. But it was also quite lacerating on a personal level, because you\u2019re working so hard to do a meticulous and fair reporting job, and then suddenly all of these issues that have nothing to do with it \u2013 and that are personal and painful \u2013 are being thrown at you, like my sister\u2019s assault. It\u2019s a dirty move.\u201d Further dirty moves followed. Astonishingly, Farrow suggests that at one point Weinstein called Woody Allen for advice, not only on how to stop the story, but on how to handle Farrow. \u201cHe wanted to know if Allen would intercede on his behalf. Allen shut down the idea,\u201d Farrow writes. (He is estranged from his father, to whom he refers by his surname.) But at the end of the call, Farrow quotes Allen saying to Weinstein, \u201cJeez, I\u2019m so sorry. Good luck.\u201d Most of the threats were theatrical and ludicrous; at one stage, Weinstein said to Farrow, in a line that would have been cut from a script for being too cheesy: \u201cYou couldn\u2019t save someone you love, and now you think you can save everyone.\u201d Meanwhile, Weinstein\u2019s connections in New York and Washington DC seemed to leave Farrow no safe port of call. One of Weinstein\u2019s fixers, Jack Palladino, hired to gather potentially harmful information on Farrow, had once worked for the Clintons; Weinstein\u2019s lawyer, David Boies, had deep connections in the liberal media; as did Lisa Bloom, the former champion of women\u2019s rights who represented Weinstein in the early stages of the investigation. (Bloom has since been thoroughly disgraced following publication of a memo in which she shared her strategy for undermining McGowan: \u201cI feel equipped to help you against the Roses of the world, because I have represented so many of them.\u201d) For a while, everywhere Farrow looked, he saw Weinstein. \u201cYou start to realise that if you are wealthy enough and connected enough, you can hire secret agents with false identities, and honeypots to seduce people, and engage in cyberhacking to try to track someone\u2019s location. This is a whole underbelly of what the wealthy and powerful do if they are in a corner,\u201d Farrow says. \u201cAnd just the gap between the tools available to men like Harvey Weinstein, and those available to any one of the sources in those stories, was incredibly upsetting to witness.\u201d I tell him I recently noticed a headline in the New York Post referring to Ally Canosa, an event planner and former Weinstein employee who spoke to Farrow, alleging that Weinstein sexually assaulted her multiple times and raped her in a hotel room. \u201cWeinstein accuser sent affectionate emails after alleged sex attack,\u201d ran the headline, followed by a piece effectively trashing Canosa. Is it possible that, even while he is out on bail, Weinstein\u2019s manipulations are ongoing? \u201cThey are without a doubt still ongoing,\u201d Farrow says. \u201cAnd there are a number of subjects reported on in this book \u2013 I\u2019m trying to vague this up, so I\u2019m not talking about anyone [specific] \u2013 who are this very week planting pieces of spin about crimes that I report on, to try to get ahead of it in a way that is so demeaning and damaging to the women involved. And the fact that there is still a media infrastructure that supports that is something we should all take a hard look at.\u201d The book\u2019s big scoop involves Farrow\u2019s former NBC colleague, the TV host Matt Lauer, who was fired from the network in 2017 for \u201cinappropriate sexual behaviour\u201d. At the time, the allegations made against him by a woman at the network were characterised by NBC as an extramarital affair gone awry; neither \u201ccriminal\u201d nor \u201can assault\u201d. According to Farrow, who names the woman as Brooke Nevils, a young production assistant, what allegedly happened meets the definition of rape. In an extraordinary scene towards the end of the book, based on the account Nevils gave Farrow, she goes to Lauer\u2019s hotel room while the pair are reporting on the Sochi Winter Olympics in 2014, and he anally rapes her. \u201cShe said that she declined several times, replying, at one point, \u2018No, that\u2019s not my thing,\u2019\u201d Farrow writes. \u201cNevils said that she was still in the midst of telling him she wasn\u2019t interested when he \u2018just did it\u2019. Lauer denies that anything non-consensual occurred, then or later, between him and Nevils. At the heart of this episode is the question of coercion; Nevils, Canosa and most of the women in Farrow\u2019s book are undermined by the men they\u2019re accusing on the basis that they maintained contact after they were allegedly attacked. \u201cIt\u2019s this fundamental misapprehension about the nature of sexual violence,\u201d Farrow says, \u201cthat it plays out in a context where you would never have any contact again. Very often it plays out because people are vulnerable to those they work with, those in their families, those they can\u2019t avoid seeing again.\u201d Meanwhile, the idea that women who report sexual harassment have something to gain by it \u2013 that losing their jobs, reputations and more often than not their self-esteem is just grist for shaking down wealthy men \u2013 continues to prosper. One comes back to the fact that it\u2019s not the crime, it\u2019s the cover-up; that the most shocking aspect of the stories broken by Farrow and his colleagues is not the alleged assaults, but the systems that allow and perpetuate them. Patient zero in both the New York Times and Farrow\u2019s reporting was McGowan, the actor who had for years been making allegations that Weinstein had raped her at the Sundance film festival in 1997. Weinstein\u2019s spin machine went after her hard, briefing against her to journalists, characterising her as \u201ccrazy\u201d and an unreliable witness. It worked. I tell Farrow that, more than once while discussing Weinstein in the early stages of the #MeToo movement, I heard myself say, \u201cRose McGowan sounds pretty nuts,\u201d in an echo of the language once used about Mia Farrow. \u201cRose McGowan, as it turns out, is very credible,\u201d Farrow says. \u201cThe claims she has made have checked out. She has not made a spurious accusation that I\u2019m aware of. She recounted details that eye witnesses at the time backed up and that documents backed up. Her personality is neither here nor there. To all of these men who were saying, \u2018Oh, but she\u2019s too crazy\u2019, I would say we interrogated her claims really, really hard. She\u2019s a great example of that dichotomy \u2013 of how sometimes, when people have sustained a lot of emotional damage and behave in a way that reflects that, they open themselves up to that criticism, particularly if they\u2019re women. It becomes a cudgel that\u2019s used to dismiss them.\u201d It is a depressing landscape that can, at times, seem to offer no break in the flow of new alleged victims. But, says Farrow, \u201cI would not have written this book if I thought it was just a glum and dreary account of how broken our systems are, or how acute the power imbalances.\u201d It\u2019s true that, while the reach of the accused men is terrifying and the scope of the alleged crimes horrific, what one takes away from the story is also the sheer power and solidarity of the women who spoke up. \u201cIt is a hopeful story about how whistleblowers at every turn expose the truth.\u201d Film versions will follow \u2013 Farrow hasn\u2019t sold his screen rights yet, though Kantor and Twohey\u2019s have gone to Plan B, Brad Pitt\u2019s production company, in conjunction with Annapurna. The threats of legal action will rumble on. In January, Weinstein will plead not guilty in a Manhattan court. And Farrow will continue reporting. \u2022 If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication).",

      "body": "<p>At first glance, <em>Queen Eleanor and Fair Rosamund</em> looks like a classic piece of pre-Raphaelite art. It shows the moment when Henry II\u2019s queen Eleanor, according to legend, discovers her husband\u2019s sequestered mistress in her secret hiding place and dramatically offers Rosamund the choice of death by dagger or poison. The scene was a firm favourite with Dante Gabriel Rossetti and Edward Burne-Jones.

The allegorical binaries, too, could be laid on thick \u2013 enraged Eleanor is accompanied by a diabolic crew of apes and lizards, while cowering Rosamund is circled by fluttering doves and cupids.

It is the work of Evelyn De Morgan, a woman whose painting was often compared to that of Burne-Jones. Sir Edward, indeed, was scathing about the young artist in his private letters, a sure sign that he felt rattled by her talent. She had been a big success at the Grosvenor Gallery, which was generally regarded as Burne-Jones\u2019s own manor. And even in De Morgan\u2019s earlier pieces, such as the luscious <em>Night and Sleep</em> (1878) made when she was just 23, you sense the painterly confidence and feeling for colour that might make any established grandmaster look to his laurels.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9eb196f2469892e9a28e8a3bcce4c1bdeba10bf1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9eb196f2469892e9a28e8a3bcce4c1bdeba10bf1/22_76_2315_2891/801.jpg\" alt=\"Fanny Eaton by Joanna Wells.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fanny Eaton by Joanna Wells.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Caspole/National Portrait Gallery</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>De Morgan is one of a dozen women whose work is celebrated in the National Portrait Gallery\u2019s autumn show <em>Pre-Raphaelite Sisters</em>. Incredibly, this is the first time that there has been an exhibition dedicated to the work of the female painters, makers, models and managers associated with the movement that disrupted British art in the second part of the 19th century. Indeed, canonical exhibitions of pre-Raphaelite art, such as the landmark exhibition at the Tate in 1984, have routinely relegated women to minor roles as muses, lovers and disappointed wives. While recent revisionary scholarship has begun to reclaim Lizzie Siddal\u2019s ambitions as a painter and Jane Morris\u2019s work as an expert needleworker, the two first ladies of pre-Raphaelitism still mostly get written up through their tortured private lives and dismal marriages to Rossetti and William Morris respectively.</p> <p>\u201cIn this exhibition we wanted to restore agency to the many women associated with the pre-Raphaelite story whose contributions have never been fully acknowledged,\u201d explains Jan Marsh, co-curator of the show. What Marsh and her colleague Alison Smith triumphantly demonstrate is not only that women produced work that was easily the equal of their male friends, brothers and uncles, but that they did so with the full self-consciousness of professional artists. De Morgan is a case in point. She was born in 1855, the granddaughter of an earl, into the kind of wealthy upper-class background where women were expected to stay conspicuously leisured. Yet rather than embarking on the life of a debutante, De Morgan took herself off to the Slade, where she proceeded to scoop a scholarship and win other glittering prizes. She also developed a rigorous practice that required her to get up early in the morning to paint before powering through to the end of the day. Not only was her work admired by the critics, she made a healthy income from selling large paintings to high-profile patrons, including MPs and industrialists. This was lucky, because her husband, the delightful but unworldly ceramicist William De Morgan, depended on her income to keep their merry, unpretentious household ticking over.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/dec/19/sensuality-lust-and-passion-how-the-pre-raphaelites-changed-the-way-the-world-sees-women\">Sensuality, lust and passion: how the Pre-Raphaelites changed the way the world sees women</a> </p> </aside>  <p>By the time Evelyn De Morgan was working at the end of the 19th century, attitudes towards female professional artists were shifting.

Like De Morgan a generation later, Boyce resisted marriage for years because she feared family life would distract from her art. But in 1857 she finally accepted a proposal from her devoted admirer Henry Wells, a portrait artist. Just four years later Joanna Boyce Wells was dead, days after giving birth to her third child. Rossetti, her brother\u2019s best friend, was summoned to take a final sketch, and could be heard murmuring later: \u201cA great artist sacrificed to bringing more kids into the world.\u201d</p> <p>One of the most unlikely life stories to be celebrated in the exhibition is that of Fanny Eaton, a Jamaican-born model. For decades Eaton was \u201chiding in plain sight\u201d in the work of the pre-Raphaelites of the 1860s. Rossetti\u2019s <em>The Beloved</em> (1865) is the most famous picture she appeared in, as the bridesmaid with dark skin. But art historians have also identified her as the model in Albert Moore\u2019s <em>The Mother of Sisera</em> (1861) and Simeon Solomon\u2019s <em>The Mother of Moses</em><em> </em>(1860). Solomon\u2019s sister Rebecca, meanwhile, used Eaton as her model for the Indian ayah in her painting of 1861 <em>The Young Teacher,</em> while for Frederick Sandys she was the medieval temptress Morgan le Fay.</p> <p>As this huge spread of proxy identities suggests, the pre-Raphaelites were happy to use Eaton, who was the daughter of a black slave and (probably) a white plantation owner, as a placeholder for a whole range of ethnicities. She could be Palestinian, Egyptian or Libyan as required. On one occasion she was turned into an African American and on another into a west African slave. The one thing she was never permitted to be was mixed-race Jamaican.</p> <p>Little is known about Eaton\u2019s life, although her descendants \u2013 who had no idea that they had black ancestry \u2013 are beginning to piece her story together through the usual family history channels. She arrived in London with her mother, Matilda, in the 1840s and went to work as a charwoman. In 1857 she married a cab driver called George Eaton, with whom she had 10 children. It seems likely that becoming a professional model for the pre-Raphaelite circle was a matter of pride and profit for Eaton. There is nothing to suggest that she was sexually involved with any of the painters (the same could hardly be said of so many of the other working-class models including Siddal, Morris, Fanny Cornforth and Annie Miller). Rather, says Marsh, what we seem to have here is a unique example of a woman of colour using her ethnic ambiguity to forge a profitable career as a professional worker in the art world. For this reason alone, Eaton takes up her place with the other 11 pre-Raphaelite sisters as a true pioneer.</p> <p> \u2022 <em>Pre-Raphaelite Sisters is at the National Portrait Gallery, London WC2H, from 17 October. <a href=\"https://www.npg.org.uk/\">npg.org.uk</a>.</em></p>",

The resort is joined with La Thuile across the Italian border to make up the Espace San Bernardo.We were attracted by its comparatively reasonable prices and excellent snow record. La Rosi\u00e8re sits at a relatively high 1,850 metres, and regularly appears in lists of best French resorts for snowfall \u2013 in <a href=\"https://www.onthesnow.co.uk/northern-alps/la-rosiere-1850/historical-snowfall.html\" title=\"\">2018/19 it </a><a href=\"https://www.onthesnow.co.uk/northern-alps/la-rosiere-1850/historical-snowfall.html\" title=\"\">had almost five metres</a>.</p> <p>It also has a good reputation within France for family-friendly skiing, which was certainly our experience. There are plenty of wide green and blue runs, with 33 of the 77 pistes suitable for beginners and improvers, plus some easy reds for the kids to progress to. There are two forest fun parks with a St Bernard dog theme, with features such as bells to hit with your pole as you ski past. The kids, especially the younger one, adored a narrow tunnel shaped like a dog\u2019s mouth that they had to squeeze through.</p> <p>Both of them also enjoyed racing down the new funcross circuit. And their minds were blown by the fact you could ski across the border to Italy without showing your passport. This does involve a couple of longish button lifts, which was tiring for the younger one, but the prize of a pizza lunch in La Thuile made up for it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9325652700b8ca154696b94f6bc359b7f5394023\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9325652700b8ca154696b94f6bc359b7f5394023/0_259_3575_2146/1000.jpg\" alt=\"dog-sledding at La Rosi\u00e8re, France\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dog-sledding at La Rosi\u00e8re</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>La Rosi\u00e8re isn\u2019t expensive, but prices in La Thuile were even cheaper. The route back to France was beautiful and otherworldly, with no lifts scarring the dramatic mountains on either side of the piste. But then, La Rosi\u00e8re itself is also one of those resorts that has great views from the slopes in all directions. We saw some beautiful sunsets during our week and it was sunny most days. Nearly all the slopes are south-facing, though thanks to the altitude the snow stays in good condition.</p> <p>One day, my husband and I put the kids in ski school so we could try out the new red pistes and freeride area around Mont-Valaisan. Now the highest point of the resort at 2,800 metres, with views of Mont Blanc from the top, the area was opened at the end of 2018. Our kids will be skiing this kind of stuff better than us in no time but, for now at least, it was beyond their level.

      "bodyText": "My six- and eight-year-old sons are watching an ice hockey match, their noses pressed to the Perspex. They gasp as the star player of the Tigres Blancs, Patrick \u201cPat\u201d Adin, gets slammed into the barrier by an opponent: his face is squished a few millimetres from theirs. When he then wins back the puck and scores, they erupt with a fervour usually reserved for their football team. All around us, French families and holidaying friends were cheering and chanting Pat\u2019s name. What made this more unusual is that Pat is in his mid-60s, and we later saw him driving the ice resurfacer in the interval and selling refreshments at the end of the match. He also gave us a skating lesson at a group session here the day before. We were in the lesser-known ski resort of La Rosi\u00e8re, which often gets overlooked in favour of its big-hitting neighbour, Les Arcs, just across the Tarentaise valley. The resort is joined with La Thuile across the Italian border to make up the Espace San Bernardo.We were attracted by its comparatively reasonable prices and excellent snow record. La Rosi\u00e8re sits at a relatively high 1,850 metres, and regularly appears in lists of best French resorts for snowfall \u2013 in 2018/19 it had almost five metres. It also has a good reputation within France for family-friendly skiing, which was certainly our experience. There are plenty of wide green and blue runs, with 33 of the 77 pistes suitable for beginners and improvers, plus some easy reds for the kids to progress to. There are two forest fun parks with a St Bernard dog theme, with features such as bells to hit with your pole as you ski past. The kids, especially the younger one, adored a narrow tunnel shaped like a dog\u2019s mouth that they had to squeeze through. Both of them also enjoyed racing down the new funcross circuit. And their minds were blown by the fact you could ski across the border to Italy without showing your passport. This does involve a couple of longish button lifts, which was tiring for the younger one, but the prize of a pizza lunch in La Thuile made up for it. La Rosi\u00e8re isn\u2019t expensive, but prices in La Thuile were even cheaper. The route back to France was beautiful and otherworldly, with no lifts scarring the dramatic mountains on either side of the piste. But then, La Rosi\u00e8re itself is also one of those resorts that has great views from the slopes in all directions. We saw some beautiful sunsets during our week and it was sunny most days. Nearly all the slopes are south-facing, though thanks to the altitude the snow stays in good condition. One day, my husband and I put the kids in ski school so we could try out the new red pistes and freeride area around Mont-Valaisan. Now the highest point of the resort at 2,800 metres, with views of Mont Blanc from the top, the area was opened at the end of 2018. Our kids will be skiing this kind of stuff better than us in no time but, for now at least, it was beyond their level. We found some lovely fresh snow and excellent steep runs, both on and off piste. The village is small, which is good for families, with two hubs: the older centre of La Rosi\u00e8re and newer Les Eucherts, which both have lifts up to the ski area and pistes running down to them. They are connected by Narnia-esque snowy forest trails, which were especially fun to walk at night. Everything is close and it\u2019s an easy place to navigate, with a good selection of cafes and restaurants serving a mix of traditional Savoyard fare, pizza and more modern stuff.

But every solid girl band needs a linchpin, someone with the infectious enthusiasm to sell even the ropiest of singles. Step forward Mollie King. 24. Lisa Blackpink\u2019s Lisa had her defining moment in this year\u2019s hyper-glossy Kill This Love video, causing havoc in what looks like east London\u2019s Cereal Killer Cafe like a perfectly styled anti-gentrification protester. 23. Heidi Range Earning her girl band stripes the hard way \u2013 she was briefly in Atomic Kitten before, in 2001, Sugababes\u2019 revolving-door recruitment policy let her in \u2013 Range was never the most dynamic pop star, favouring chunky highlights and Girl Next Door energy. But give her a middle eight and \u2013 briefly \u2013 there were few better. 22. Dawn Richard Sugababes aside, Danity Kane are the messiest of modern-day girl bands, with album campaigns often hampered by lineup changes or, as with 2014\u2019s DK3, physical fights. Amid all that drama sits Dawn Richard, who walks the thin line between \u201cmercurial talent\u201d and \u201cloose cannon\u201d perfectly. 21. Keisha Buchanan Every girl band needs someone who embodies their unique raison d\u2019etre and during Sugababes\u2019 early career no one quite lived out the trio\u2019s \u201cdon\u2019t talk to me\u201d attitude quite like Keisha. Also: can still ad-lib like her life depends on it. 20. Sarah Harding It is December 2008, Girls Aloud are promoting their single The Loving Kind on GMTV and all is right in the world, when suddenly a sound like a goose passing a jagged boulder unspools from Sarah Harding\u2019s mouth, instantly cementing her status with a bum note so magnificent musicologists are still unpacking it. 19. CL The best thing about K-pop\u2019s best girl band, 2NE1, CL managed to embody both the group\u2019s hard-edged futuristic playfulness and their vulnerability. Plus, at a 2012 awards show, she performed with a live parrot sitting on her shoulder. A PARROT! 18. Normani Fifth Harmony had all the chemistry of a Tory party conference, but it was clear almost immediately that one person stood out, with Normani offering up gymnast-level devotion to choreography and the noble girl band art of walking as if you\u2019re the best person on the planet. 17. Nicole Scherzinger Less a girl band and more a vehicle for Nicole Scherzinger\u2019s impending solo career, the Pussycat Dolls nevertheless still needed to be led, and Scherzinger stepped up to the role with the manic gusto of someone who really, really wanted it. 16. T-Boz A good girl band needs a good vocal blend, but it also helps if there is a voice that stands out, one that you can easily identify. TLC have that in T-Boz, whose husky, hungover-with-a-hint-of-honey croon works on both the sultry swing of Creep and the cracked vulnerability of Unpretty. 15. Siobh\u00e1n Donaghy Even without the heavily mythologised Sugababes\u2019 breakup story (she didn\u2019t climb out of a toilet window to escape), there was always something indescribably cool about Donaghy, all cut-glass vocals (debut Overload is basically a solo single) and porcelain beauty. 14. Melanie Blatt For pairing combat trousers with a pregnancy bump on Saturday morning TV. For looking as if she could drink you under the table at the Met Bar any day of the week. For winning Celebrity Spectacle Wearer 2008. And, most importantly, for the celestial verses on Pure Shores. 13.

Jade Thirlwall Modern pop\u2019s best girl band member, Thirlwall has taken on politicians, homophobes and Piers Morgan, all while being the vocal glue that holds Little Mix together. Once farted in front of me. 10. Ronnie Spector The Ronettes\u2019 Be My Baby basically invented Amy Winehouse circa Back to Black, and in among all the back-combed hair high enough to house a small family of voles was Spector\u2019s immaculate voice, a clarion call for every single emotion. 9.

Fuelled their recent reunion on pure passion alone. 3. Geri Halliwell Yes she dresses like a home counties mum now, doling out platitudes to Theresa May, but to a whole generation Geri Halliwell represents girl band incarnate. Halliwell \u2013 who favoured hard work over raw talent \u2013 feverishly pushed the Girl Power ethos, barging her way into male-dominated spaces when no one wanted to listen.

      "bodyText": "School gates can be a \u201cbreeding ground for harmful myths\u201d about vaccines, the chief executive of NHS England has said, as he called for a zero-tolerance approach to misinformation about their alleged dangers. Simon Stevens said it was often the parents who did their best to find out more about the impact and effect of vaccines on their children who were liable to be deceived by \u201cfake news\u201d. \u201cIn this way the school gates themselves can be a breeding ground for harmful myths to catch on, spread and ultimately infect parents\u2019 judgment,\u201d he wrote in the Daily Mail. \u201cThat parents\u2019 efforts and anxiety to make the right decision for their children are jeopardised by wilful misinformation is unacceptable.\u201d Stevens backed efforts by internet companies to prioritise information about the safety of vaccines and their usefulness, and to censor information about alleged risks. \u201cWith parents often taking their cue from other mums and dads, there must be a zero-tolerance approach to misinformation, while the government\u2019s strategy on improving vaccination levels will help to drive action,\u201d he said. Last month, experts expressed alarm at the drop in take-up of routine childhood vaccinations across England. The UK recently lost its measles-free status because of the fall in rates of MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) immunisation. But recently published figures also showed a more widespread loss of confidence in vaccinations. At the ages of 12 months, 24 months and five years, there had been a marked decline in vaccination rates against 13 different diseases, including whooping cough (pertussis), diphtheria and meningitis. Confidence in the MMR jab appeared to have been dropping at least partly in response to social media misinformation and scare stories. The discredited claims of Andrew Wakefield, who theorised in 1998 that the immunisation was linked to autism, continue to be widely circulated.",

He merely pressed home the point on a misty morning in Austria. With the clock stopped and a sporting world looking on with awe, the 34-year-old Kenyan displayed all the physical strain of having walked for the morning papers.</p> \n<p>\u201cI felt a lot of pressure yesterday,\u201d Kipchoge admitted. \u201cI received a lot of calls of encouragement from all over the world. The president of Kenya called me. When you receive so many calls from high-profile people, there is pressure.\u201d</p> \n<p>Kipchoge described the period between a 4.50am wake-up call and his scheduled 8.15am start as the toughest of his life. What followed resembled blissful simplicity.</p> \n<p>Giddy comparisons to other sporting and historical acts were inevitable and duly forthcoming. It is altogether fair to reference Roger Bannister, who 65 years ago achieved what had been widely perceived as impossible by running a mile in under four minutes. That Kipchoge has entered the domain of first man on the moon Neil Armstrong \u2013 as some commentators claimed \u2013 is, however, a stretch.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/10/archive-zip/giv-3902EwedbZHoPOxf/\" data-alt=\"Kipchoge\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/10/archive-zip/giv-3902EwedbZHoPOxf/\">Kipchoge</a> \n</figure> \n<p>This was an operation afforded military levels of planning and an even loftier budget. Vienna had been preferred to London because of benign conditions. Kipchoge ran every kilometre between a range of 2:48 and 2:52. Teams of seven pacemakers \u2013 in a phalanx formation, 2-1-2-2 - not only kept Kipchoge on the right side of the clock but protected him from what little breeze existed. That was controversial. So, too, the green lasers projected on to the road as a further safeguard against losing ground. This is not sport as we knew it. The hills couldn\u2019t be alive because the hills didn\u2019t exist; Kipchoge\u2019s route was entirely flat and 90% straight.</p> \n<p>Ineos, a petrochemical company not exempt from bad publicity, reportedly ploughed \u00a315m into this event. The brand was unavoidable, to the point where you could have suspected this was the key protagonist\u2019s surname. Jim Ratcliffe, the company\u2019s founder and richest man in the UK, sat alongside Kipchoge for his post-run press conference.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a72fb6de-c06d-4050-a710-f3df01bb7bf2\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BvC5FhhsItk?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Ratcliffe was afforded the kind of canned laughter as follows men of his wealth around. Dave Brailsford, seemingly unaffected by the controversy that attached itself to Team Sky which is now rebranded Team Ineos, was sat in the front row. When Kipchoge\u2019s status as a Nike athlete - <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/11/charismatic-irritating-nike-oregon-project-closure\" title=\"\">the sportswear giant wounded by the Alberto Salazar affair</a> - is factored in, those seeking to detract from what transpired here are not short of ammunition. Kipchoge\u2019s prototype running shoes will fly from shelves when eventually released to the public at \u00a3240 a pop. How much of this actually relates to man and muscle?</p> \n<p>Technological advancements are not unique to athletics. He is not at all troubled by the fact the IAAF does not recognise this feat as a record, a scenario perhaps impacted by the detail that he holds the world\u2019s best official marathon time anyway.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/12/faster-harder-stronger-human-limits-records-endurance-sport\">Higher, faster, stronger, better ... is there no end to what humans can do?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>This was about breaking barriers and showing, as the marathon logo stated, that no human is limited. If that is true, presumably the glass ceiling for those famous 26.2 miles has yet to be reached.</p> \n<p>Kipchoge, essentially a modest sort, said he knew within the first kilometre he would achieve his goal. He swatted aside one view that mid-race presented brief troubles. \u201cThat\u2019s untrue,\u201d he said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Recap\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3888\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It seemed incredible that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/apr/28/london-marathon-eliud-kipchoge-and-brigid-kosgei-win-men-and-womens-elite-races\" title=\"\">four-time London marathon winner</a> trained for this pursuit for four months. And the morning breakfast of champions?

Records are meant to be broken, I\u2019m sure someone down the road will want to try to break this one, but history has been made.\u201d</p> \n<p>Kipchoge quietly exited to bestow an epic party on his 41 pacemakers. Pretty swiftly \u2013 if not in the territory of the man himself \u2013 this corner of Vienna returned to normality. Marathon running, meanwhile, will never be the same again. </p>",

With the clock stopped and a sporting world looking on with awe, the 34-year-old Kenyan displayed all the physical strain of having walked for the morning papers. \u201cI felt a lot of pressure yesterday,\u201d Kipchoge admitted. \u201cI received a lot of calls of encouragement from all over the world. The president of Kenya called me. When you receive so many calls from high-profile people, there is pressure.\u201d Kipchoge described the period between a 4.50am wake-up call and his scheduled 8.15am start as the toughest of his life. What followed resembled blissful simplicity. Giddy comparisons to other sporting and historical acts were inevitable and duly forthcoming. It is altogether fair to reference Roger Bannister, who 65 years ago achieved what had been widely perceived as impossible by running a mile in under four minutes. That Kipchoge has entered the domain of first man on the moon Neil Armstrong \u2013 as some commentators claimed \u2013 is, however, a stretch. This was an operation afforded military levels of planning and an even loftier budget. Vienna had been preferred to London because of benign conditions. Kipchoge ran every kilometre between a range of 2:48 and 2:52. Teams of seven pacemakers \u2013 in a phalanx formation, 2-1-2-2 - not only kept Kipchoge on the right side of the clock but protected him from what little breeze existed. That was controversial. So, too, the green lasers projected on to the road as a further safeguard against losing ground. This is not sport as we knew it. The hills couldn\u2019t be alive because the hills didn\u2019t exist; Kipchoge\u2019s route was entirely flat and 90% straight. Ineos, a petrochemical company not exempt from bad publicity, reportedly ploughed \u00a315m into this event. The brand was unavoidable, to the point where you could have suspected this was the key protagonist\u2019s surname. Jim Ratcliffe, the company\u2019s founder and richest man in the UK, sat alongside Kipchoge for his post-run press conference. Ratcliffe was afforded the kind of canned laughter as follows men of his wealth around. Dave Brailsford, seemingly unaffected by the controversy that attached itself to Team Sky which is now rebranded Team Ineos, was sat in the front row. When Kipchoge\u2019s status as a Nike athlete - the sportswear giant wounded by the Alberto Salazar affair - is factored in, those seeking to detract from what transpired here are not short of ammunition. Kipchoge\u2019s prototype running shoes will fly from shelves when eventually released to the public at \u00a3240 a pop. How much of this actually relates to man and muscle? Technological advancements are not unique to athletics. He is not at all troubled by the fact the IAAF does not recognise this feat as a record, a scenario perhaps impacted by the detail that he holds the world\u2019s best official marathon time anyway. This was about breaking barriers and showing, as the marathon logo stated, that no human is limited. If that is true, presumably the glass ceiling for those famous 26.2 miles has yet to be reached. Kipchoge, essentially a modest sort, said he knew within the first kilometre he would achieve his goal. He swatted aside one view that mid-race presented brief troubles. \u201cThat\u2019s untrue,\u201d he said. It seemed incredible that the four-time London marathon winner trained for this pursuit for four months. And the morning breakfast of champions? Oatmeal. The runner\u2019s coach, Patrick Sang, cut one of many euphoric figures. \u201cHe has inspired all of us to stretch our limits in our lives,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything went perfectly. Records are meant to be broken, I\u2019m sure someone down the road will want to try to break this one, but history has been made.\u201d Kipchoge quietly exited to bestow an epic party on his 41 pacemakers. Pretty swiftly \u2013 if not in the territory of the man himself \u2013 this corner of Vienna returned to normality. Marathon running, meanwhile, will never be the same again.",

      "body": "<p>The lives of the three Song sisters \u2013 the subjects of Jung Chang\u2019s spirited new book \u2013 are more than worthy of an operatic plot. Born between 1888 and 1898, the twilight of imperial China, all three went on to play dominant roles in 20th-century Chinese life, on the extremes of the political spectrum.</p> <p>The daughters of Charlie Song, a Methodist preacher turned Shanghai entrepreneur, they became the first Chinese girls to attend university in the US, and left speaking and writing better English than Chinese. On returning to Shanghai after 1909, the two older sisters, Ailing and Qingling, threw themselves into the maelstrom of the revolution, for their father was a patron of Sun Yat-sen, whose chaotic conspiracies helped overthrow the country\u2019s last dynasty in 1911. Both young women became Sun\u2019s private secretary; both were courted by him.</p> <p>Ailing was not interested and went on to marry a businessman, HH Kung; the couple would accumulate one of the greatest personal fortunes of 20th-century China. Qingling \u2013 27 years Sun\u2019s junior \u2013 accepted his advances in 1915, to the horror of her parents. For the rest of Sun\u2019s life, Qingling followed him around the world, as he struggled to reunite under his leadership a Chinese republic that had disintegrated into provincial militarism. This led to at least one near-death experience, when Qingling was trapped in a military attack by one of Sun\u2019s rivals. She miscarried during a traumatic escape, and was subsequently \u2013 to her great sorrow \u2013 unable to have children.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1a94d397a5d33c4a39fb5a52f667deedd2d0d07d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1a94d397a5d33c4a39fb5a52f667deedd2d0d07d/0_151_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"From left: Madame Chiang Kai-shek \u2013 Meiling \u2013 with her sisters Ailing and Qingling in 1942 in Chungking.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">From left: Madame Chiang Kai-shek \u2013 Meiling \u2013 with her sisters Ailing and Qingling in 1942 in Chungking.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While Ailing went into business and Qingling became a political wife, the youngest of the sisters, Meiling, devoted herself to Shanghai high society. In search of a successful, ambitious husband who could guarantee her access to political influence and material comfort, she settled on<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/dec/13/featuresreviews.guardianreview4\" title=\"\"> Chiang Kai-shek</a>. A humourless, conservative army man, Chiang had thrust his way to becoming Sun\u2019s heir as leader of China\u2019s first modern political party, the Nationalists, after Sun suddenly died of liver cancer in 1925. Benefiting from Soviet support, and an alliance with China\u2019s Communist party (CCP), in 1927 Chiang became head of a new, nominally unified nationalist state. But to secure his control of the country, he promptly purged the communists from his new regime, killing thousands. Qingling sided with the left (after 1927, she spent two years in exile in Moscow), while Meiling became first lady of Chiang\u2019s rightwing military dictatorship. Chiang also highly esteemed big sister Ailing as a political and financial adviser.</p> <p>The sisters therefore reproduced in microcosm the great political schism \u2013 nationalist versus communist \u2013 of 20th-century China. Through the 1930s and 40s, Qingling put her energies and talents \u2013 cosmopolitanism, charm, beauty, political untouchability (she was one of the few left-wing public figures whom Chiang did not dare terrorise, given the family connection) \u2013 into burnishing the image of communism in China. Time and again she directed towards the CCP educated Chinese whom the party needed to run its state, and drew to the cause useful, impressionable foreigners. By 1937, Qingling had become a covert stakeholder in Mao\u2019s revolution, sending him $50,000 of her savings \u2013 almost $750,000 by today\u2019s rates. Chang argues that Qingling was in fact a card-carrying member of the Comintern for much of the Stalin era.</p> <p>Meiling became a major political player in the nationalist government. Her value to her husband\u2019s regime shone particularly through the grim years of the second world war. In 1942, she took herself off on a 10-month publicity tour of the US, preaching the gospel of friendship between China and the US, pleading for American \u201cmoral support\u201d (and dollars). She brought a cheering Congress to tears; she drew tens of thousands to her public lectures; Time magazine named her and Chiang \u201cMan and Wife of the Year\u201d. She spoke in perfect American English on her stiff, bad-tempered husband\u2019s behalf not only in the US, but also at key negotiations with western leaders, including the 1943 Cairo Conference. After the CCP defeated the Nationalists in 1949, Qingling served as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/from-the-archive-blog/2019/oct/01/mao-zedong-proclaims-establishment-of-peoples-republic-of-china-1949\" title=\"\">Mao Zedong</a>\u2019s vice-chairman on the mainland, while Meiling followed Chiang Kai-shek into exile in Taiwan.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1ee777eceeb93ccf06e6ba1656c86511f4044db8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ee777eceeb93ccf06e6ba1656c86511f4044db8/0_0_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sun Yat-sen\u2019s mausoleum in Nanjing.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sun Yat-sen\u2019s mausoleum in Nanjing.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: STR/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The book\u2019s strongest point is its nuanced sympathy for the sisters. Ailing and Meiling, in particular, have been periodically lambasted for seeking profit and indulgence, and abetting Chiang\u2019s brutal dictatorship, during the agonies of the second world war. Although Chang records Meiling\u2019s extravagance and addiction to comfort, \u201clittle sister\u201d also comes over as surprisingly affectionate and loyal, especially to her family. Ailing \u2013 conventionally denounced as a ruthless profiteer \u2013 is described as a devoted sister who saw it as her responsibility to provide financially for her less practically minded siblings. In Chang\u2019s account, Qingling is the least appealing: a hard-headed Comintern convert, whose political convictions overrode feelings for her family.</p> <p>A little oddly for a group biography of three remarkable women, however, the book sometimes veers off into male-dominated accounts of their context. The opening chapter focuses entirely on Sun Yat-sen; the second on the girls\u2019 father. This periodic sidelining of the women expresses, of course, the paradox of their status (a paradox that applies to many other female Chinese politicians of the past 100 years). They were able to exercise influence only through association with powerful, deeply flawed men. The book would have benefited from more reflection on the tensions and limits faced by ambitious women in 20th-century China \u2013 and on the challenges this poses for telling their stories.</p> <p>\u2022<em> </em>Julia Lovell\u2019s <em>Maoism: A Global History </em>is published by Bodley Head. <em>Big Sister, Little Sister, Red Sister</em> is published by Jonathan Cape (\u00a325).

      "bodyText": "The lives of the three Song sisters \u2013 the subjects of Jung Chang\u2019s spirited new book \u2013 are more than worthy of an operatic plot. Born between 1888 and 1898, the twilight of imperial China, all three went on to play dominant roles in 20th-century Chinese life, on the extremes of the political spectrum. The daughters of Charlie Song, a Methodist preacher turned Shanghai entrepreneur, they became the first Chinese girls to attend university in the US, and left speaking and writing better English than Chinese. On returning to Shanghai after 1909, the two older sisters, Ailing and Qingling, threw themselves into the maelstrom of the revolution, for their father was a patron of Sun Yat-sen, whose chaotic conspiracies helped overthrow the country\u2019s last dynasty in 1911. Both young women became Sun\u2019s private secretary; both were courted by him. Ailing was not interested and went on to marry a businessman, HH Kung; the couple would accumulate one of the greatest personal fortunes of 20th-century China. Qingling \u2013 27 years Sun\u2019s junior \u2013 accepted his advances in 1915, to the horror of her parents. For the rest of Sun\u2019s life, Qingling followed him around the world, as he struggled to reunite under his leadership a Chinese republic that had disintegrated into provincial militarism. This led to at least one near-death experience, when Qingling was trapped in a military attack by one of Sun\u2019s rivals. She miscarried during a traumatic escape, and was subsequently \u2013 to her great sorrow \u2013 unable to have children. While Ailing went into business and Qingling became a political wife, the youngest of the sisters, Meiling, devoted herself to Shanghai high society. In search of a successful, ambitious husband who could guarantee her access to political influence and material comfort, she settled on Chiang Kai-shek. A humourless, conservative army man, Chiang had thrust his way to becoming Sun\u2019s heir as leader of China\u2019s first modern political party, the Nationalists, after Sun suddenly died of liver cancer in 1925. Benefiting from Soviet support, and an alliance with China\u2019s Communist party (CCP), in 1927 Chiang became head of a new, nominally unified nationalist state. But to secure his control of the country, he promptly purged the communists from his new regime, killing thousands. Qingling sided with the left (after 1927, she spent two years in exile in Moscow), while Meiling became first lady of Chiang\u2019s rightwing military dictatorship. Chiang also highly esteemed big sister Ailing as a political and financial adviser. The sisters therefore reproduced in microcosm the great political schism \u2013 nationalist versus communist \u2013 of 20th-century China. Through the 1930s and 40s, Qingling put her energies and talents \u2013 cosmopolitanism, charm, beauty, political untouchability (she was one of the few left-wing public figures whom Chiang did not dare terrorise, given the family connection) \u2013 into burnishing the image of communism in China. Time and again she directed towards the CCP educated Chinese whom the party needed to run its state, and drew to the cause useful, impressionable foreigners. By 1937, Qingling had become a covert stakeholder in Mao\u2019s revolution, sending him $50,000 of her savings \u2013 almost $750,000 by today\u2019s rates. Chang argues that Qingling was in fact a card-carrying member of the Comintern for much of the Stalin era. Meiling became a major political player in the nationalist government. Her value to her husband\u2019s regime shone particularly through the grim years of the second world war. In 1942, she took herself off on a 10-month publicity tour of the US, preaching the gospel of friendship between China and the US, pleading for American \u201cmoral support\u201d (and dollars). She brought a cheering Congress to tears; she drew tens of thousands to her public lectures; Time magazine named her and Chiang \u201cMan and Wife of the Year\u201d. She spoke in perfect American English on her stiff, bad-tempered husband\u2019s behalf not only in the US, but also at key negotiations with western leaders, including the 1943 Cairo Conference. After the CCP defeated the Nationalists in 1949, Qingling served as Mao Zedong\u2019s vice-chairman on the mainland, while Meiling followed Chiang Kai-shek into exile in Taiwan. The book\u2019s strongest point is its nuanced sympathy for the sisters. Ailing and Meiling, in particular, have been periodically lambasted for seeking profit and indulgence, and abetting Chiang\u2019s brutal dictatorship, during the agonies of the second world war. Although Chang records Meiling\u2019s extravagance and addiction to comfort, \u201clittle sister\u201d also comes over as surprisingly affectionate and loyal, especially to her family. Ailing \u2013 conventionally denounced as a ruthless profiteer \u2013 is described as a devoted sister who saw it as her responsibility to provide financially for her less practically minded siblings. In Chang\u2019s account, Qingling is the least appealing: a hard-headed Comintern convert, whose political convictions overrode feelings for her family. A little oddly for a group biography of three remarkable women, however, the book sometimes veers off into male-dominated accounts of their context. The opening chapter focuses entirely on Sun Yat-sen; the second on the girls\u2019 father. This periodic sidelining of the women expresses, of course, the paradox of their status (a paradox that applies to many other female Chinese politicians of the past 100 years). They were able to exercise influence only through association with powerful, deeply flawed men. The book would have benefited from more reflection on the tensions and limits faced by ambitious women in 20th-century China \u2013 and on the challenges this poses for telling their stories. \u2022 Julia Lovell\u2019s Maoism: A Global History is published by Bodley Head.

Riding the subway on her way to campus, she noticed other passengers watching NBA contests live on their smartphones.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/10/the-guardian-view-on-china-and-basketball-power-games\">The Guardian view on China and basketball: power games | Editorial</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t just one or two people, it was a number of them,\u201d said Delpy Neirotti, who has repeatedly traveled to China since the late 1980s. \u201c8pm on the east coast is 8am there, so the games fall at a really good time.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you walk through train stations, you see [Golden State Warriors star] Steph Curry everywhere. We\u2019re not talking small signs. It\u2019s large billboards of him holding a phone or something. Of all the sports, basketball is the one that [Chinese people] follow most. And those who follow are very passionate.\u201d</p> <p>For decades, the NBA has worked to cultivate that passion, transforming China into the league\u2019s most lucrative market outside of the United States. But now those efforts are in jeopardy, with the fallout from a tweet from a Houston Rockets executive supporting protests in Hong Kong straining relations between the world\u2019s premier basketball league and its second-largest economy.</p> <p>In the aftermath of the since-deleted tweet from Rockets general manager Daryl Morey that prompted condemnation from China\u2019s government and outcry from the country\u2019s state-run media, several Chinese companies and brands have suspended or cut ties with the NBA.</p> <p>Meanwhile, league commissioner Adam Silver has disregarded Chinese calls to punish Morey or condemn his tweet, instead following an initial apology that trigged backlash in the US with a longer statement supporting the right of NBA players and employees to speak freely in accordance with American values.</p> <p>The result is an unresolved standoff \u2013 set against the geopolitical backdrop of an ongoing US-China trade war and the continuing Hong Kong protests \u2013&#xa0;in which neither side seems eager to escalate nor willing to back down.</p> <p>To wit: while the Los Angeles Lakers and Brooklyn Nets still were set to play a previously-scheduled exhibition game Saturday in Shenzhen, their Thursday contest in Shanghai was devoid of domestic advertising and not broadcast by Chinese media. Customary news conferences for players and Silver were cancelled by Chinese officials.</p> <p>The larger stakes? A heretofore lucrative relationship among the NBA, its business partners and their counterparts in China.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re not taking about a couple [former Houston Rockets player and Chinese basketball superstar] Yao Ming jerseys being sold in China,\u201d says Warren K Zola, a Boston College professor and sports business expert. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about billions of dollars coming in.</p> <p>\u201cThis is an enormous tipping point for the league. They\u2019ve targeted China as a market for the short and long term. And it has come to fruition. But then you have their social activism stance. The NBA and Adam Silver have been incredibly supportive of their players and employees being vocal.</p> <p>\u201cSo you have this tension \u2013 money versus the rights given to people here in the United States in the Constitution. It\u2019s a huge conflict.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>\u2018A quick firestorm\u2019</strong></h2> <p>The conflict began last Friday night, when Morey tweeted an image that read, \u201cFight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong.\u201d</p> <p>Hong Kong\u2019s demonstrations started in June to protest a proposed extradition law that many city residents saw as a threat to the limited autonomy and additional rights \u2013 including freedom of speech and assembly \u2013 enjoyed by the former British colony since its handover to China in 1997.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/09/woke-nba-china-corporations-profits-free-speech\">The 'woke' NBA is a reminder: corporations put profits before free speech | Bhaskar Sunkara</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The protests have since evolved to include demands for full democracy, and clashes between activists and police have sometimes been violent.</p> <p>China\u2019s government and state media have painted the protestors as dangerous separatists challenging the nation\u2019s sovereignty at the behest of American intelligence agencies, using the situation to stoke nationalist sentiment.</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, Chinese reaction to Morey\u2019s tweet was overwhelmingly negative. Telecom giant Tencent and state broadcaster CCTV suspended broadcasts of Rockets games, while other sponsors suspended relations with the team. The Chinese Basketball Association, chaired by Yao, followed suit.</p> <p>\u201cChina has always been extremely sensitive on the issue of sovereignty, but part of this has to do with timing,\u201d said Bruce Dickson, a professor of political science and international affairs at George Washington University and an expert on China. \u201c[Morey\u2019s] tweet came in the middle of a long national holiday, right after the 70th anniversary of the founding of the [People\u2019s Republic of China].</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s also a time when the government is trying to stoke nationalism, and pin Hong Kong on foreign influences trying to interfere with their internal affairs. That resonates with Chinese audiences. And to top it all off, it\u2019s the Houston Rockets. If there\u2019s any NBA team that\u2019s popular in China, it\u2019s them. All of those things made this a quick firestorm.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"533c72dfa0c650e497901bcb5c80d7e1ab2314b0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/533c72dfa0c650e497901bcb5c80d7e1ab2314b0/0_140_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"NBA China Games\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fans in LeBron James jerseys pose for pictures with Chinese flags near security personnel outside the Mercedes-Benz Arena before Thursday\u2019s exhibition game between Brooklyn Nets and Los Angeles Lakers in Shanghai.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aly Song/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In response, Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta publicly rebuked his general manager. The team\u2019s star guard, James Harden, apologized for Morey\u2019s tweet. Joseph Tsai, the Canadian-Taiwanese owner of the Nets and co-founder of the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, posted an open letter that invoked the Opium Wars of the mid-19th century and said that the damage from the tweet would \u201ctake a long time to repair\u201d.</p> <p>The NBA released a statement in Mandarin expressing disappointment in Morey. That led to criticism in America, with Republican senator Ted Cruz and Democratic presidential candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke blasting the league, respectively, for \u201cshamefully retreating\u201d and prioritizing \u201cprofits over human rights\u201d.</p> <p>While speaking in Japan on Tuesday, Silver backtracked, stating that the NBA is \u201cnot apologizing for Daryl exercising his freedom of expression\u201d.</p> <p>That stance was congruent with league\u2019s previous acceptance of its players and coaches speaking out about off-court issues, including police brutality and the presidency of Donald Trump.

      "bodyText": "For Lisa Delpy Neirotti, the surest sign of the National Basketball Association\u2019s booming business in China came during her morning commute. It was two years ago, and Delpy Neirotti, a sports management professor at George Washington University, was guest lecturing at Beijing Sports University. Riding the subway on her way to campus, she noticed other passengers watching NBA contests live on their smartphones. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just one or two people, it was a number of them,\u201d said Delpy Neirotti, who has repeatedly traveled to China since the late 1980s. \u201c8pm on the east coast is 8am there, so the games fall at a really good time. \u201cWhen you walk through train stations, you see [Golden State Warriors star] Steph Curry everywhere. We\u2019re not talking small signs. It\u2019s large billboards of him holding a phone or something. Of all the sports, basketball is the one that [Chinese people] follow most. And those who follow are very passionate.\u201d For decades, the NBA has worked to cultivate that passion, transforming China into the league\u2019s most lucrative market outside of the United States. But now those efforts are in jeopardy, with the fallout from a tweet from a Houston Rockets executive supporting protests in Hong Kong straining relations between the world\u2019s premier basketball league and its second-largest economy. In the aftermath of the since-deleted tweet from Rockets general manager Daryl Morey that prompted condemnation from China\u2019s government and outcry from the country\u2019s state-run media, several Chinese companies and brands have suspended or cut ties with the NBA. Meanwhile, league commissioner Adam Silver has disregarded Chinese calls to punish Morey or condemn his tweet, instead following an initial apology that trigged backlash in the US with a longer statement supporting the right of NBA players and employees to speak freely in accordance with American values. The result is an unresolved standoff \u2013 set against the geopolitical backdrop of an ongoing US-China trade war and the continuing Hong Kong protests \u2013 in which neither side seems eager to escalate nor willing to back down. To wit: while the Los Angeles Lakers and Brooklyn Nets still were set to play a previously-scheduled exhibition game Saturday in Shenzhen, their Thursday contest in Shanghai was devoid of domestic advertising and not broadcast by Chinese media. Customary news conferences for players and Silver were cancelled by Chinese officials. The larger stakes? A heretofore lucrative relationship among the NBA, its business partners and their counterparts in China. \u201cWe\u2019re not taking about a couple [former Houston Rockets player and Chinese basketball superstar] Yao Ming jerseys being sold in China,\u201d says Warren K Zola, a Boston College professor and sports business expert. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about billions of dollars coming in. \u201cThis is an enormous tipping point for the league. They\u2019ve targeted China as a market for the short and long term. And it has come to fruition. But then you have their social activism stance. The NBA and Adam Silver have been incredibly supportive of their players and employees being vocal. \u201cSo you have this tension \u2013 money versus the rights given to people here in the United States in the Constitution. It\u2019s a huge conflict.\u201d \u2018A quick firestorm\u2019 The conflict began last Friday night, when Morey tweeted an image that read, \u201cFight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong.\u201d Hong Kong\u2019s demonstrations started in June to protest a proposed extradition law that many city residents saw as a threat to the limited autonomy and additional rights \u2013 including freedom of speech and assembly \u2013 enjoyed by the former British colony since its handover to China in 1997. The protests have since evolved to include demands for full democracy, and clashes between activists and police have sometimes been violent. China\u2019s government and state media have painted the protestors as dangerous separatists challenging the nation\u2019s sovereignty at the behest of American intelligence agencies, using the situation to stoke nationalist sentiment. Unsurprisingly, Chinese reaction to Morey\u2019s tweet was overwhelmingly negative. Telecom giant Tencent and state broadcaster CCTV suspended broadcasts of Rockets games, while other sponsors suspended relations with the team. The Chinese Basketball Association, chaired by Yao, followed suit. \u201cChina has always been extremely sensitive on the issue of sovereignty, but part of this has to do with timing,\u201d said Bruce Dickson, a professor of political science and international affairs at George Washington University and an expert on China. \u201c[Morey\u2019s] tweet came in the middle of a long national holiday, right after the 70th anniversary of the founding of the [People\u2019s Republic of China]. \u201cIt\u2019s also a time when the government is trying to stoke nationalism, and pin Hong Kong on foreign influences trying to interfere with their internal affairs. That resonates with Chinese audiences. And to top it all off, it\u2019s the Houston Rockets. If there\u2019s any NBA team that\u2019s popular in China, it\u2019s them. All of those things made this a quick firestorm.\u201d In response, Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta publicly rebuked his general manager. The team\u2019s star guard, James Harden, apologized for Morey\u2019s tweet. Joseph Tsai, the Canadian-Taiwanese owner of the Nets and co-founder of the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, posted an open letter that invoked the Opium Wars of the mid-19th century and said that the damage from the tweet would \u201ctake a long time to repair\u201d. The NBA released a statement in Mandarin expressing disappointment in Morey. That led to criticism in America, with Republican senator Ted Cruz and Democratic presidential candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke blasting the league, respectively, for \u201cshamefully retreating\u201d and prioritizing \u201cprofits over human rights\u201d. While speaking in Japan on Tuesday, Silver backtracked, stating that the NBA is \u201cnot apologizing for Daryl exercising his freedom of expression\u201d. That stance was congruent with league\u2019s previous acceptance of its players and coaches speaking out about off-court issues, including police brutality and the presidency of Donald Trump. But it did nothing to soothe anger in China, where NBA business partners including a travel website, a milk producer and a smartphone maker publicly announced that they were suspending or ending their relationships with the league. CNN subsequently reported that a Chinese man wearing a Rockets jersey was arrested for posting a photo of himself ready to burn his country\u2019s flag with the comment: \u201cI live and die with this team.\u201d Hu Xijin, the editor of China\u2019s most prominent state-run newspaper, published an essay on the blogging site Weibo that read in part, \u201cthe more rabidly the US demonstrates its political correctness, the more radical a backlash it will get from the Chinese Internet. The absurd US arrogance will kill the NBA\u2019s market in China.\u201d \u2018An enormous market\u2019 If the league is unable to resolve its differences with China, then it could pay a heavy price for supporting free speech. Brought to China by Christian missionaries in the late 19th century, basketball has a long history in the country. One of the few Western cultural activities not frowned upon during the Cultural Revolution, it was promoted by Mao Zedong and became particularly popular within the Chinese military. In 1979, the Washington Bullets became the first NBA team to play in China, and six years later the Chinese national team toured the US at the invitation of then-league commissioner David Stern. Stern brought a demo tape to Beijing in 1987, cutting a deal with CCTV to show videotapes of games delivered weekly from New York. In the 1990s, Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls helped popularize the league with Chinese viewers, and the Rockets\u2019 selection of Yao with the top pick in the 2002 NBA draft supercharged interest. CCTV began showing NBA games live; Yao\u2019s first game, against Shaquille O\u2019Neal and the Lakers, was said to have drawn an audience of more than 200m viewers. The NBA estimates that more than 300m people in China play basketball \u2013 a number that\u2019s nearly as large as the total US population. Last year, 800m Chinese viewers watched league programming on television or digital platforms, while more than 150m followed the league on social media. Forty million Chinese gamers were registered to play the NBA 2K video game. To capitalize on its status as the most popular sports league in a country of 1.4bn people, the NBA has staged nearly 30 games in China since 2004 (over 14 of the past 15 seasons), established offices in Hong Kong, Beijing and Shanghai, and opened basketball academies and 200 streetwear-themed NBA Style stores across the country. And investing in China has paid off. Earlier this year, the league extended its digital rights deal with Tencent for a reported $1.5bn over five years, making the telecom the NBA\u2019s largest partner outside the US. According to Bloomberg, both the league and its teams have a number of other sponsorship deals and a NBA representative told the news organization that the league\u2019s business in China has grown at double-digit percentages every year since 2008. China has been a gold mine for NBA players and apparel manufacturers, too. Warriors star Klay Thompson has a contract with the Chinese shoe company Anta worth a reported $80m. Retired star Dwyane Wade has a lifetime deal with rival Li-Ning. Nike, which supplies the NBA with uniforms and counts Lakers star LeBron James among its many league endorsers, sold $6.21bn worth of merchandise in China in the 2019 fiscal year. The company reportedly has enjoyed sales growth in the country of over 10% in every quarter for more than five years, thanks largely to sales from its Jordan Brand and Nike Basketball. Last year, NBA deputy commissioner Mark Tatum told Forbes that NBA China, which was founded in 2008 and is the only separately incorporated league business outside of the US, was worth $4bn. \u201cChina is an absolutely enormous market for the NBA in terms of finances, eyeballs, future growth,\u201d Zola said. \u201cYou have the world\u2019s largest population and soon to be the largest economy. And it\u2019s huge for the players, too. Several have deals with Chinese companies \u2013 Klay Thompson, [Portland guard] CJ McCollum, [Boston forward] Gordon Hayward.\u201d When Curry launched a new line of signature golf apparel with Under Armour in June, he did so from a course in Shenzhen. \u201cNBA players like to take it easy in the summer after a long season,\u201d Zola said. \u201cBut the one place you\u2019ll see them go for a week or two is a tour of China.\u201d \u2018A tough spot\u2019 Earlier this week, a league source told the Houston Chronicle that fallout from Morey\u2019s tweet could cost the Rockets between $10m and $25m. Meanwhile, Yahoo Sports reported that at least five NBA teams already were planning for the possibility that the league\u2019s salary cap for the 2020-21 season could drop between 10% and 15% without expected revenue from China, a loss of roughly $17m per team. Long-term losses for the NBA could be far greater. Like many international firms, the league is betting on the continued growth of China\u2019s middle class, which is expected to reach 550m people in three years \u2013 more than one-and-a-half times the entire current US population. When Fertitta purchased the Rockets for $2.2bn in 2017 and when Tsai recently bought the Nets at a valuation of $2.35bn, sale prices were bolstered by the prospect of an increasingly robust Chinese basketball market. \u201cThere\u2019s still room for growth there, and for engaging fans,\u201d Delpy Neirotti said. \u201cThere\u2019s still room for growth in terms of Internet and social media followers, too.\u201d Faced with Chinese ire for perceived support of Tibet or independence or democratic movements in Hong Kong and Taiwan, many American and international corporations have followed a similar playbook: censor the offensive statement, punish the offending employees, and publicly apologize for hurting the feelings of the Chinese people. Just this week, US video game maker Activision Blizzard suspended professional gamer Chung Ng Wai from an esports tournament and stripped him of his earnings after he appeared to shout \u201cLiberate Hong Kong, revolution of our time\u201d during a post-match interview streamed in Taiwan. Following criticism from the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s official newspaper, Apple removed an app from its store that Hong Kong protestors have used to track police movements. \u201cChina using this pressure strategy on private companies mostly works, and it works because companies are worried about losing access to the Chinese market,\u201d Dickson said. \u201cThey\u2019ve usually rolled over. Quietly, but nevertheless rolled over.\u201d So far, the NBA has taken a different approach \u2013 likely, in part, because the league was roundly criticized in the US for initially appearing to kowtow to China. A bipartisan group of eight Congressional members \u2013 including Cruz and Democratic congresswoman Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez \u2013 sent a letter to Silver on Wednesday urging the league to suspend its activities in China until broadcasters and sponsors end their boycotts and to reevaluate having a youth basketball training center in Xinjiang, where China reportedly has created a cruel and repressive police state for the region\u2019s Muslims. \u201cThe NBA has to worry about the American audience, too,\u201d Dickson said. \u201cNow that you have people in Congress reacting, Silver is in a tough spot.

      "body": "<p>China is a very large country, inhabited by many Chinese. Looking back it seems fair to say Charles de Gaulle was probably right in this assessment, not to say prophetic. In the intervening years China has become even larger. It is inhabited by even more Chinese.</p> <p>To the outsider this vastness can seem a little dizzying.

Not when it comes to World Cup qualifying and the fevered dreams of Xi Jinping-era Chinese football. As of this month it is necessary to add a plus-one to the 1.4 billion population in the shape of former Everton and England Under-21 defender Tyias Browning, who is now a Chinese citizen, and even has a Chinese name: Jiang Guangtai.</p> <p>Browning signed for Guangzhou Evergrande in February after spells at Sunderland, Preston and Wigan. Six months later he is officially Chinese. Although not yet Chinese enough \u2013 according to reports in the Chinese-English media \u2013 for his legal team to convince Fifa he has the right to take part in this week\u2019s round of AFC Group A World Cup qualifiers.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/11/gareth-southgate-england-czech-republic-wake-up-call\">\u2018A lot of work to be done\u2019: Southgate says England\u2019s Czech defeat is wake-up call</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When full clearance arrives Browning will have a fair chance of lining up in China\u2019s central defence behind another familiar face. Nico Yennaris did play for China against Guam this week. In July, Yennaris, formerly of Arsenal and the England age groups, became the first naturalised player for the world\u2019s most populous nation. He also has a Chinese name: Li Ke.</p> <p>There is a serendipity to all this. Fancy seeing you here old boy! Eight years ago Jiang Guangtai and Li Ke played on opposite sides as Arsenal reserves beat Everton reserves 4-1 at London Colney, a match also notable for the fact Shkodran Mustafi was in the Everton defence, albeit with a scoreline made slightly less notable by the fact Shkodran Mustafi was in the Everton defence.</p> <p>Five years ago Browning was on the bench next to Harry Kane as a Gareth Southgate England Under-21 team played Wales in a Euro qualifier.

      "bodyText": "China is a very large country, inhabited by many Chinese. Looking back it seems fair to say Charles de Gaulle was probably right in this assessment, not to say prophetic. In the intervening years China has become even larger. It is inhabited by even more Chinese. To the outsider this vastness can seem a little dizzying. This is the last great wilderness once humans have killed off the rest of them: other humans. China has more than one hundred cities with more than a million inhabitants, cities with their own traditions, infrastructure, hierarchies, artisan coffee stall scenes and endless, unknowable inner lives. China has 250 million pensioners. Imagine four United Kingdoms occupied entirely by old people. Imagine four Brexits. That\u2019s how many people there are in China. And yet it seems this still isn\u2019t quite enough. Not when it comes to World Cup qualifying and the fevered dreams of Xi Jinping-era Chinese football. As of this month it is necessary to add a plus-one to the 1.4 billion population in the shape of former Everton and England Under-21 defender Tyias Browning, who is now a Chinese citizen, and even has a Chinese name: Jiang Guangtai. Browning signed for Guangzhou Evergrande in February after spells at Sunderland, Preston and Wigan. Six months later he is officially Chinese. Although not yet Chinese enough \u2013 according to reports in the Chinese-English media \u2013 for his legal team to convince Fifa he has the right to take part in this week\u2019s round of AFC Group A World Cup qualifiers. When full clearance arrives Browning will have a fair chance of lining up in China\u2019s central defence behind another familiar face. Nico Yennaris did play for China against Guam this week. In July, Yennaris, formerly of Arsenal and the England age groups, became the first naturalised player for the world\u2019s most populous nation. He also has a Chinese name: Li Ke. There is a serendipity to all this. Fancy seeing you here old boy! Eight years ago Jiang Guangtai and Li Ke played on opposite sides as Arsenal reserves beat Everton reserves 4-1 at London Colney, a match also notable for the fact Shkodran Mustafi was in the Everton defence, albeit with a scoreline made slightly less notable by the fact Shkodran Mustafi was in the Everton defence. Five years ago Browning was on the bench next to Harry Kane as a Gareth Southgate England Under-21 team played Wales in a Euro qualifier. Fast forward another three and he could yet end up marking Kane at the Qatar World Cup. It is a possibility that has moved closer with the upsurge in China\u2019s fortunes since the decision to redefine what being a Chinese footballer actually means. It should be said Yennaris and Browning have a Chinese family link: Browning through his grandfather; and Yennaris, who was born in Hackney, London, through his mother. But they also appear to be the exceptions in this vanguard. Elkeson, a 30-year-old Brazilian from Maranh\u00e3o, also played for China as they thrashed the island of Guam 7-0.

      "body": "<p>In recent years, it has become mainstream for women (and often men) to wear multiple ear piercings \u2013 and not just in their lobes. Helix (the upper ear), daith (the knobbly bit, halfway up), tragus (between the daith and lobe), conch (the ear\u2019s recess) piercings and many more, can now be seen on bank managers, executives, stay-at-home parents and even one vicar I met recently. As the owner of six (and counting) ear piercings myself, I\u2019m all for it; but they must be done properly to be a pleasure.</p> <p>I feel strongly about piercing guns, in so far as I loathe them, utterly. In my considerable experience of hearing readers ask how to treat skin allergies caused by nickel or piercings, I\u2019ve found that the sticky, icky, sore and oozy-eared have almost always been pierced with a gun.</p> <p>I advise people to remove the earrings, allow holes to close, then to visit not a jeweller\u2019s or fashion store \u2013 but a proper piercing shop, full of heavily pierced experts who are invariably obsessed with their art. This nearly always reveals that they don\u2019t have a metal allergy at all.</p> <p>I\u2019m a case in point. I spent my adolescence with such horribly sticky, sore, weeping ears (having been pierced twice by a gun). I became convinced that, princess and the pea-like, I could (barely) tolerate only solid gold.</p> <p>As an adult, I was repierced with a needle by a burly, 80% tattooed piercer (at <a href=\"https://metalmorphosisuk.com/services/\" title=\"\">Metalmorphosis</a><a href=\"https://metalmorphosisuk.com/services/\" title=\"\"> in London</a>, but any council-licensed dedicated piercing shop is fine) and can now wear any old market tat without so much as an itch. I\u2019ve sent many of my friends and readers down the same path, with life-changing results.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/sep/14/sali-hughes-40-best-sustainable-beauty-brands\">Sali Hughes's 40 best sustainable beauty brands</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Proper needle piercings simply heal better, cleaner and permanently, in a way that gun piercings, for many of us, don\u2019t.</p> <p>Which isn\u2019t to say nothing can go wrong with a needle. The trend for inserting precious jewellery into a piercing on day one (and I\u2019ve done this several times myself), isn\u2019t ideal for all. Less risky \u2013 if initially less attractive \u2013 is to get a titanium earring, shaped appropriately for the location of the piercing, for the first six to eight weeks, such as those at <a href=\"https://punktured.co.uk/collections/basics/products/titanium-barbell\" title=\"\">Punktured</a>, from \u00a32 (where I\u2019ve also been pierced brilliantly).</p> <p>I always clean my new sites by washing them with warm water under the tap whenever I brush my teeth, but purists will prefer<strong> <a href=\"https://www.boots.com/boots-sterile-saline-travel-pack-360ml-10115260\" title=\"\">Boots Sterile Saline</a></strong> (\u00a32.99 for 360ml).

      "bodyText": "In recent years, it has become mainstream for women (and often men) to wear multiple ear piercings \u2013 and not just in their lobes. Helix (the upper ear), daith (the knobbly bit, halfway up), tragus (between the daith and lobe), conch (the ear\u2019s recess) piercings and many more, can now be seen on bank managers, executives, stay-at-home parents and even one vicar I met recently. As the owner of six (and counting) ear piercings myself, I\u2019m all for it; but they must be done properly to be a pleasure. I feel strongly about piercing guns, in so far as I loathe them, utterly. In my considerable experience of hearing readers ask how to treat skin allergies caused by nickel or piercings, I\u2019ve found that the sticky, icky, sore and oozy-eared have almost always been pierced with a gun. I advise people to remove the earrings, allow holes to close, then to visit not a jeweller\u2019s or fashion store \u2013 but a proper piercing shop, full of heavily pierced experts who are invariably obsessed with their art. This nearly always reveals that they don\u2019t have a metal allergy at all. I\u2019m a case in point. I spent my adolescence with such horribly sticky, sore, weeping ears (having been pierced twice by a gun). I became convinced that, princess and the pea-like, I could (barely) tolerate only solid gold. As an adult, I was repierced with a needle by a burly, 80% tattooed piercer (at Metalmorphosis in London, but any council-licensed dedicated piercing shop is fine) and can now wear any old market tat without so much as an itch. I\u2019ve sent many of my friends and readers down the same path, with life-changing results. Proper needle piercings simply heal better, cleaner and permanently, in a way that gun piercings, for many of us, don\u2019t. Which isn\u2019t to say nothing can go wrong with a needle. The trend for inserting precious jewellery into a piercing on day one (and I\u2019ve done this several times myself), isn\u2019t ideal for all. Less risky \u2013 if initially less attractive \u2013 is to get a titanium earring, shaped appropriately for the location of the piercing, for the first six to eight weeks, such as those at Punktured, from \u00a32 (where I\u2019ve also been pierced brilliantly). I always clean my new sites by washing them with warm water under the tap whenever I brush my teeth, but purists will prefer Boots Sterile Saline (\u00a32.99 for 360ml). Use twice daily.",

There have been times over the </em><em>past three years, Trump, Brexit, the climate strikes \u2013 </em><em>when we could have run a campaign re-stating our role or talking specifically about that issue. For us, however, we wanted our readers to feel inspired by a more enduring belief which editor-in-chief </em><em>Katharine Viner</em><em> articulated in her 2017 essay <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/nov/16/a-mission-for-journalism-in-a-time-of-crisis\">\u201cA mission for journalism in a time of crisis\u201d</a> . In this article she says \u201cpeople long to feel hopeful again and that </em><em>hope, above all, is a faith in our capacity to act together to make change\u201d.</em></p> <p><em>This idea is central to our campaign. We want our readers to feel that although the issues that face us can</em><em> seem overwhelming, </em><em>the Guardian is offering clarity and alternatives which can help to make sense of the world.</em></p> <p><em> \u201cHope is Power\u201d feels relevant and urgent in these disorientating times. It\u2019s a message we can all rally behind. Our campaign is connected to the Guardian\u2019s purpose - we\u2019re here for our readers - we don\u2019t have any stakeholders or a billionaire owner. We really wanted to provide our readers with a sense of hope and optimism against the current backdrop.</em></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/help/insideguardian/2019/sep/23/introducing-the-guardians-new-brand-campaign-hope-is-power\">Introducing the Guardian\u2019s new brand campaign &quot;Hope is Power&quot;</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><br>Where can readers see the campaign \u2013 in the UK and elsewhere? How can they get more involved?</h2> <p><em><strong>KD</strong> - </em><em>The campaign launched on 23 September and will run for five weeks in the UK, US and Australia. It is the first time we have made a statement like this at a global level. It\u2019s a different way of doing a brand campaign for us because we are now a digital-first global organisation, the last time we did this, in 2012, we were at the start of the \u201copen journalism\u201d model, now our open platform allows us to reach millions of readers across the world every day.</em></p> <p><em>We also wanted the campaign to reach people in an interesting but meaningful way in their everyday lives, so we targeted cities in the UK where we have a high percentage of Guardian readers with flyposters. </em><em>Additionally, we developed bright and powerful statements which were posted online and in locations across the UK, US and Australia.</em></p> <p><em>We created a film to bring Hope is Power to life which is playing nationally in cinemas and on video on demand. </em><em>The campaign relied on carefully targeted use of the Guardian\u2019s platforms, contra agreements and an effective media plan including the use of flyposting and targeted podcast ads.</em></p> <p><em><strong>SS</strong> - Our campaign asks for \u201csupport\u201d </em><em>\u2013 we want more of our readers to feel inspired to support us financially </em><em>\u2013 that means making a contribution or subscribing. Importantly we want to recognise the valued support of our current supporters and hopefully make them feel as proud to work with us.</em></p> <h2><br>How did the idea for the butterfly come about?</h2> <p><em><strong>KD</strong> - We wanted to create something totally distinctive and powerful without breaking the bank. Lots of ideas were explored with the creative team, but we had some clear rules, nothing too masculine, nothing too angry and it had to feel \u201cGuardian\u201d. We have this incredible heritage in advertising and storytelling and it had to be as good as our previous adverts.</em></p> <p><em>We </em><em>started with </em><em>the track \u2018Nothing Changes\u2019 by </em><em><a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C5CHFA_enGB840GB840&amp;q=Ana%C3%AFs+Mitchell&amp;stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAONgVuLUz9U3SE6vrLJYxMrvmJd4eH2xgm9mSXJGak4OAHhc1-QfAAAA&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj25JjKoorlAhWxnVwKHaYYCaYQMTAAegQIDBAF\">Ana\u00efs Mitchell</a></em><em>, from the musical </em><em>Hades Town</em><em>. As soon as we all heard it we knew it was the perfect song. It captured the hopelessness we all sometimes feel with taunting lines like \u201cWhy bother, why even try\u201d </em><em>\u2013 it brought into sharp focus the daily struggle for our journalists in the face of apathy and the feeling of powerlessness we face.</em></p> <p><em>From there we explored different icons and ideas of hope to contrast </em><em>with this powerful song.

      "bodyText": "Two weeks ago, the Guardian launched its latest brand campaign focused on the theme of hope. The hero advert depicts the struggle of a painted lady butterfly battling against the odds and succeeding. The campaign highlights the Guardian\u2019s purpose to not only hold power to account, but to explore new ways of doing things, bringing new ideas to the table and giving people the facts to challenge the status quo. We spoke to Anna Bateson (chief customer officer), Sonia Sudhakar (marketing director), Kate Davies (head of brand and awareness), Joel Midgley (senior marketing manager), and Kate Robarts (marketing manager) The sentiment of the campaign differs to so many other campaigns at the moment. Can you tell us a bit about the campaign\u2019s theme? AB - It was incredibly important to us that what we were saying was both rooted in this moment but also in our editorialpurpose. There have been times over the past three years, Trump, Brexit, the climate strikes \u2013 when we could have run a campaign re-stating our role or talking specifically about that issue. For us, however, we wanted our readers to feel inspired by a more enduring belief which editor-in-chief Katharine Viner articulated in her 2017 essay \u201cA mission for journalism in a time of crisis\u201d . In this article she says \u201cpeople long to feel hopeful again and that hope, above all, is a faith in our capacity to act together to make change\u201d. This idea is central to our campaign. We want our readers to feel that although the issues that face us can seem overwhelming, the Guardian is offering clarity and alternatives which can help to make sense of the world. \u201cHope is Power\u201d feels relevant and urgent in these disorientating times. It\u2019s a message we can all rally behind. Our campaign is connected to the Guardian\u2019s purpose - we\u2019re here for our readers - we don\u2019t have any stakeholders or a billionaire owner. We really wanted to provide our readers with a sense of hope and optimism against the current backdrop. Where can readers see the campaign \u2013 in the UK and elsewhere? How can they get more involved? KD - The campaign launched on 23 September and will run for five weeks in the UK, US and Australia. It is the first time we have made a statement like this at a global level. It\u2019s a different way of doing a brand campaign for us because we are now a digital-first global organisation, the last time we did this, in 2012, we were at the start of the \u201copen journalism\u201d model, now our open platform allows us to reach millions of readers across the world every day. We also wanted the campaign to reach people in an interesting but meaningful way in their everyday lives, so we targeted cities in the UK where we have a high percentage of Guardian readers with flyposters. Additionally, we developed bright and powerful statements which were posted online and in locations across the UK, US and Australia. We created a film to bring Hope is Power to life which is playing nationally in cinemas and on video on demand. The campaign relied on carefully targeted use of the Guardian\u2019s platforms, contra agreements and an effective media plan including the use of flyposting and targeted podcast ads. SS - Our campaign asks for \u201csupport\u201d \u2013 we want more of our readers to feel inspired to support us financially \u2013 that means making a contribution or subscribing. Importantly we want to recognise the valued support of our current supporters and hopefully make them feel as proud to work with us. How did the idea for the butterfly come about? KD - We wanted to create something totally distinctive and powerful without breaking the bank. Lots of ideas were explored with the creative team, but we had some clear rules, nothing too masculine, nothing too angry and it had to feel \u201cGuardian\u201d. We have this incredible heritage in advertising and storytelling and it had to be as good as our previous adverts. We started with the track \u2018Nothing Changes\u2019 by Ana\u00efs Mitchell, from the musical Hades Town. As soon as we all heard it we knew it was the perfect song. It captured the hopelessness we all sometimes feel with taunting lines like \u201cWhy bother, why even try\u201d \u2013 it brought into sharp focus the daily struggle for our journalists in the face of apathy and the feeling of powerlessness we face. From there we explored different icons and ideas of hope to contrast with this powerful song. The butterfly stood out immediately. The idea that this really quite familiar and domestic struggle could capture beautifully the assumption of powerlessness, but then the surprising almost violent breakthrough \u2013 an impossible act really but one that seems to connect so well with our readers. The fact that we used a painted lady was also important. It is a resilient species that, in the face of the climate emergency, was seen in unusually high numbers in the UK this year. It is also a global species travelling from Africa to the Arctic circle annually - what could be more hopeful than that? How did all the aspects of the campaign come together? How long did the process take? JM - In total the campaign took six months to develop. We started by making sure that we fully explored Viner\u2019s essay, interviewing editorial colleagues in our territories to explore the ideas behind this essay and how it has translated into our journalism. When we started this process we wanted to find creative partners who were able to grasp the rich heritage of the Guardian and our role in the changing context of the world. Uncommon responded with a bold and distinctive creative idea and series of powerful statements anchored to the Guardian\u2019s purpose. The campaign makes heavy use of flyposters and so we wanted the creative to capture a feeling of protest, an energy that we think is really important in the current climate and it seems to be resonating really well with readers. What are your hopes for the campaign? What will success look like? KD - This is a carefully planned campaign aimed at deepening affinity with our readers. It is strongly connected to supporter initiatives globally which build towards our ambition to reach 2 million supporters by 2022. We are unique in being a quality independent news site with no paywall and we believe that this reader-funded model is the right one. The idea that if you can afford to pay for quality news your contribution helps others to access it is really compelling. But we do need to keep talking to our readers about this to ensure we reach our ambitious goals and remain sustainable. What has the initial reaction been? Why do you think this has struck such a chord with people? KR - We have had a really positive reaction so far. We are an emotional brand - we see surges in support around times of heightened emotion - anxiety, excitement, inspiration - the campaign captures this. People are fed up with despair, gloomy predictions and feeling helpless. The Guardian is here to offer fresh ideas, alternatives and hope and it seems like our readers are ready to be part of that. What\u2019s next for your team? KD - \u2018Hope is Power\u2019 is an idea that we think lives beyond this campaign. It\u2019s linked to our purpose and we want to continue to develop ways of talking to our readers about it and supporting the amazing work that our journalists do. We are working very closely with our global teams and the rest of the organisation to develop a strategy that supports our reader-funded model for the next few years.",

But the more I turned the pages, the more evident the similarities became. Noah and Michael are free to cross the Atlantic, change hotels on a whim, eat ice-creams and churros for dinner if they choose (which Michael, to Noah\u2019s weary resignation, does regularly). But the pair are as unable to escape one another as <em>Room</em>\u2019s Ma and Jack. Themes of imprisonment run through both novels, as do questions of what it means to be related. If this book demonstrates Donoghue\u2019s range as an author \u2013 and it does, in spades \u2013 it also shows her circling back to a handful of key concerns. In <em>Akin</em>, she has found a way to consider the subjects of love, freedom and family from a freshly illuminating perspective.</p> <p>For Noah, these days, family appears to exist only in the rear-view mirror. His wife died several years back; his beautiful, incorrigible nephew perished 18 months ago on a motel bedroom floor, \u201cveins full of heroin and fentanyl\u201d; his sister soon after that. Further back still, and made hazy by distance, are his mother Margot and his grandfather, a famous photographer who worked under the name of P\u00e8re Sonne. Noah lived with him in Nice until the age of four, when he was evacuated to the US as the second world war closed in. This excursion to France \u2013 Noah\u2019s first since he left as a child \u2013 is conceived as a cross between a sophisticated indulgence (the sort a well-heeled, childless academic can afford), and a trip down memory lane: a means of reconnecting with his admired, beloved forebears, and with a history he\u2019s proud of, but barely recalls.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If Room forced home truths on us, about parenthood and love, Akin deals with similar subject matter more subtly</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Into all this barrels Michael: awkward, furious, phone held up to his face, hat pulled low over his eyes. His father is dead, and his mother is serving jail time for criminal possession of controlled substances. He had been living with his maternal grandmother, but after her sudden death from diabetes complications, his social worker calls Noah. \u201cI\u2019m exploring Michael\u2019s kinship resources,\u201d she explains; if no family member can be found to take him, he\u2019ll be removed into care. The pair, who have never met, are forced together by virtue of their shared blood: a solution that nobody wants, but everybody reluctantly acknowledges is, in the circumstances, the least worst option.</p> <p>The path of the generational collision is a well-trodden one, but Donoghue dances along it with customary lightness. Thrown together against their will, as the pair travel around Nice they clash, talk at cross-purposes and ultimately learn from one another \u2013 but Donoghue is far too wise to force them into an unearned happy ending. Rather than love, what grows between them is something more formal and interesting: a sense of mutual respect. Noah thinks to tell his great-nephew about their shared family, but comes to realise, over the course of the book, how little he knows of them himself. In the end, Michael \u2013 clearer-eyed, less nostalgic \u2013 is able to make the leaps that Noah can\u2019t, leading Noah to a deeper understanding of the mother and grandfather he revered. At the same time, the older man is forced to question his assumptions about the nephew he\u2019d loved and then written off, and the slice of society to which Michael himself belongs.

      "body": "<p>When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/oct/04/sharon-horgan-motherland-unstoppable-rise-as-the-master-of-honest-comedy\">Motherland\u2019s</a> pilot episode was broadcast in September 2016, it was \u2013 like the first dad at a breastfeeding support group \u2013 a quiet revolution. Previously, sitcom mums tended to be the calm centre in the storm of family life (Susan in My Family, Sue in Outnumbered, Clair in The Cosby Show, Jackie in Friday Night Dinner). There was nothing quite as thrillingly chaotic as Julia, played by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2018/aug/26/anna-maxwell-martin-ive-been-bullied-by-other-women-in-the-industry-in-fact-more-so-than-i-have-by-men-\">Anna Maxwell </a>Martin, attempting to buy black school shoes with her two kids in tow, on the last day before term starts, five minutes before the shop closes, as she does in the opening scene of Motherland season two. Nothing, in other words, that was truly honest about the experience of being a mother.</p> <p>To Helen Linehan, one of the series\u2019 writers, the reason for this omission is obvious: who would want to watch a show about the stress of motherhood? \u201cFor me, all I wanted to do was just have a nice conversation about music or something and not bloody babies,\u201d she recalls of the time in her life when Motherland was first conceived, and she was a stay-at-home mother of two. \u201cBecause what everyone wants to talk about is their baby and it\u2019s the most boring subject.\u201d This is the kind of extreme boredom that can drive people to extreme behaviour, it turns out: \u201cSome of the antics that go on! Especially with PTAs. There\u2019ll be people in tears or there\u2019ll be fights and stuff and the behaviour is so bizarre that it wouldn\u2019t translate to telly, d\u2019you know what I mean? No one would believe you.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"dd4e039147f0ddb140b0eff20193c57f3ae6f381\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd4e039147f0ddb140b0eff20193c57f3ae6f381/2208_58_4299_2580/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sharon Horgan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sharon Horgan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Still, Linehan thought there might be a sitcom in it. She and her husband, Graham Linehan (Father Ted, The IT Crowd), approached another writing team, Sharon Horgan and Holly Walsh, who had separately been working on a pilot with similar themes for US television. \u201cWe wrote a show for a US network about a mother who was struggling, fucking up, getting it wrong,\u201d explains Horgan. \u201cBy the time we came to shoot it she was 60% less of a mess. So it was 60% less funny. I think at that time there wasn\u2019t an appetite for mothers on screen who were saying this is all wrong or kicking back.\u201d</p> <p>The four joined forces around their common idea. Unlike the many, less funny, family sitcoms that came before, Motherland would not be a show about how mothers relate to their offspring, or how mothers relate to fathers (both the children and the nominal co-parents are mostly off-screen). It would be about how mothers relate to each other. Maybe the day-to-day business of mothering is too boring for television, but motherhood? That\u2019s one of the most fascinating \u2013 and funny \u2013 life experiences there is.</p> <p>Three years on and Motherland\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/oct/07/motherland-review-weary-parents-rejoice-the-savage-school-gate-sitcom-is-back\">second series</a> has started, with a third already commissioned. At the same time, an explosion of online parenting content \u2013 ranging from Insta-influencers to confessional \u201cslummy mummies\u201d \u2013 has helped both consolidate an audience for motherhood comedy and provide writers with a treasury of new material.</p> <p>Motherland is now one of several shows that present child-rearing from a woman\u2019s point of view. There are international takes, such as the Australian TV show <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/oct/25/the-letdown-review-an-affecting-portrait-of-motherhood-with-spoonfuls-of-comedy\">The Letdown</a> and Canadian series Workin\u2019 Moms; semi-autobiographical portraits of single motherhood, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/feb/28/better-things-gets-better-pamela-adlon-triumphs-without-louis-ck\">Pamela Adlon\u2019s Better Things</a> and Frankie Shaw\u2019s SMILF; and even a sub-genre of heavily pregnant standup specials, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/jun/09/comedian-ali-wong-netflix-baby-cobra-fresh-off-the-boat\">Ali Wong\u2019s</a> Baby Cobra and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/mar/16/amy-shumer-growing\">Amy Schumer\u2019s Growing</a>. The implicit promise of them all is that they will give it to us straight. Ali Wong on work-life balance, for instance: \u201cReal talk? I have a nanny. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s the answer. Yes, it\u2019s very unlikable and unpopular to broadcast that because not everybody can afford a nanny, it\u2019s super-expensive. Both me and my husband have to hustle. We have to work very hard to not take care of our child ourselves.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3e05eb2d0aa7d12c3db850683d96edaca9633882\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e05eb2d0aa7d12c3db850683d96edaca9633882/0_67_1024_614/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alison Bell as Audrey in The Letdown.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alison Bell as Audrey in The Letdown.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ABC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In a relatively short time, motherhood has gone from a comedy blindspot to one of its favourite topics. For all the talk of funny women making waves, this might be the most compelling evidence yet of real progress towards equality: not only are women more numerous in creative roles, they have the power to get shows made about topics relevant to them, whether or not the menfolk are also laughing.</p> <p>It is a trajectory that is also reflected in the Motherland writers\u2019 room, now that Graham, the show\u2019s sole male writer, has been replaced by writer-performer Barunka O\u2019Shaughnessy (Hunderby, Timewasters). Get four working mothers together in one room and you\u2019ll get four very different solutions to that hoary old conundrum: \u201cHow does she do it?\u201d</p> <p>Motherland\u2019s perspective is undeniably that of the comfortably-off London mum (it\u2019s set around Acton, west London) \u2013 but even within that specific stratum there are variations. Between the writers, they have children from toddler age to teens, experience of state and private schooling, stay-at-home parenting and various types of outsourced childcare. During the series, we\u2019re also reintroduced to super-stressed Julia who, early in season two, swaps a full-time event-planning job for working from home, but finds she\u2019s no less stressed. Alpha mum-turned-mumpreneur Amanda (Lucy Punch) might be more enviable if she wasn\u2019t so relentlessly judgmental about everyone else\u2019s choices. Single parent Liz (Diane Morgan) is a heroic source of dry wit and ingenious parenting shortcuts, but her income source remains mysterious. Then there\u2019s Kevin (Paul Ready), the stay-at-home dad who\u2019s recently taken on some work at soft-play centre Kiddiverse. \u201cIt\u2019s really great!\u201d he tells Liz during a school gate catch-up. \u201cPart-time, so I can still drop the kids, very average wage so Jill doesn\u2019t feel threatened \u2026 whole package, really!\u201d</p> <p>For the second series, Motherland\u2019s horizons have been further expanded by the introduction of a new character. \u201cWhen I came, what I thought was missing was a character who\u2019s able to do everything,\u201d says O\u2019Shaughnessy. \u201cSo for me it was more about: well, who is this extraordinary character? And what can we do with her that makes her sort of slightly fallible.\u201d By this point the other writers had noticed an omission, too: people of colour. Series two introduces Meg (played by black British actor Tanya Moodie), a high-flying businesswoman who has five children. \u201cY\u2019know, that sort of Nicola Horlick template of motherhood,\u201d says O\u2019Shaughnessy. \u201cYou\u2019re always looking for a chink in their armour, because you\u2019re always comparing yourself.\u201d</p> <p>The introduction of Meg goes some way to pre-empting any criticism of Motherland\u2019s narrow focus but, as O\u2019Shaughnessy acknowledges, there is a limit: \u201cI think if you want to tell a different side to motherhood you have to go to a different area and into a different class or, whatever, background, and you can cover that \u2026 There are other shows that are about the more vulnerable end of being a parent in this world but that\u2019s not our remit.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfMc3pUYbg0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XfMc3pUYbg0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>If Motherland\u2019s creators seem anxious to do their bit for inclusivity, that\u2019s understandable. You don\u2019t need to spend much time on Mumsnet to realise that the same properties that make motherhood such a bounteous topic for comedy also make it a touchy one. The \u201cmommy wars\u201d rumble on, on various fronts (breastfeeding v bottle-feeding, stay-at-home v working, sugar-free v reality etc), emotions run high and everyone is sleep-deprived. Even in the manuals and blogs designed to support parents, generalised observations can feel like personal digs. \u201cIt upsets me when we\u2019re not united in saying it\u2019s fucking hard,\u201d says Horgan. \u201cA girl at my daughter\u2019s school told her that her mum was worried I didn\u2019t spend enough time with my daughter and she just \u2018wishes\u2019 I was around more. Seriously, you take one job away from home four years ago! Anyway, now I want to give her a one-inch punch in her judge-y chops. Y\u2019know, I thought it was sort of funny. But I also thought that that kind of thing is so unhelpful. And feeding into a sort of sexist bias that puts all the responsibility on the mother, to be a certain type or project a certain image. Fuck that. Stick together and support each other. Your daughters need to see that.\u201d</p> <p>And don\u2019t forget about the dads. Paul Ready, who plays Kevin, says he pushed to ensure that his character gets to \u201cwin a bit more\u201d this season. \u201cSocially, if the world is changing and we need more stay-at-home dads and there\u2019s going to be proper equality, then I think it\u2019s dangerous to have a stay-at-home dad who is just the butt of the joke,\u201d he says. Rest assured that Kevin\u2019s desperation to be part of the mum-crowd is still the butt of many jokes, and probably always will be. \u201cI think he always has to slightly lose,\u201d says Ready, \u201cor he wouldn\u2019t be Kevin any more.\u201d</p> <p>The brutal reality of school-gate society is that excluding those who don\u2019t fit is an essential bonding ritual, and this is at the very core of Motherland. Indeed, excluding outsiders (all the characters are outsiders, in some sense) might be the only group-bonding method strong enough to bring together women who, as Walsh has joked, \u201chave nothing in common except the fact that you all had unprotected sex on the same weekend\u201d. That explains how the mud-flecked, military-influenced motto \u201cNo mum left behind\u201d gets taken up as series two\u2019s sometimes ironic, sometimes earnest rallying cry.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve read a lot of scripts lately dealing with these themes \u2013 the difficult, painful, often hilarious reality of parenting,\u201d says Lucy Punch, who plays Amanda. \u201cI think there\u2019s a trend and need in our culture right now for authenticity and honesty, not just in comedy \u2026 Those fantasy worlds that [once] existed \u2026 wouldn\u2019t feel relevant or work in the same way now.\u201d Not for Motherland, then, the mysteriously baby-free brunching of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jun/23/sex-and-the-city-made-me-who-i-am\">Sex and </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jun/23/sex-and-the-city-made-me-who-i-am\">the City</a>, or the perfectly coiffed labours of Friends. Instead, this season features those half-term holidays that end up being no kind of holiday at all, the manic #mumdrunk hedonism of a rare night out and the sweaty guilt of missing sports day.</p> <p>How does Motherland transform such recognisably stressful events into an enjoyable half-hour of weeknight comedy? It\u2019s a question Linehan once asked herself: \u201cI thought: \u2018Would I want to sit down with a glass of wine and watch this? After wrangling my kids all day?\u2019\u201d Somehow it works, and Linehan has a theory: \u201cHopefully, it\u2019s just so extreme you think: \u2018Oh, thank God my life isn\u2019t like that!\u2019 When, actually, it nearly is.\u201d</p> <p><em>Motherland is on Mondays, BBC Two, 10pm</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "When Motherland\u2019s pilot episode was broadcast in September 2016, it was \u2013 like the first dad at a breastfeeding support group \u2013 a quiet revolution. Previously, sitcom mums tended to be the calm centre in the storm of family life (Susan in My Family, Sue in Outnumbered, Clair in The Cosby Show, Jackie in Friday Night Dinner). There was nothing quite as thrillingly chaotic as Julia, played by Anna Maxwell Martin, attempting to buy black school shoes with her two kids in tow, on the last day before term starts, five minutes before the shop closes, as she does in the opening scene of Motherland season two. Nothing, in other words, that was truly honest about the experience of being a mother. To Helen Linehan, one of the series\u2019 writers, the reason for this omission is obvious: who would want to watch a show about the stress of motherhood? \u201cFor me, all I wanted to do was just have a nice conversation about music or something and not bloody babies,\u201d she recalls of the time in her life when Motherland was first conceived, and she was a stay-at-home mother of two. \u201cBecause what everyone wants to talk about is their baby and it\u2019s the most boring subject.\u201d This is the kind of extreme boredom that can drive people to extreme behaviour, it turns out: \u201cSome of the antics that go on! Especially with PTAs. There\u2019ll be people in tears or there\u2019ll be fights and stuff and the behaviour is so bizarre that it wouldn\u2019t translate to telly, d\u2019you know what I mean? No one would believe you.\u201d Still, Linehan thought there might be a sitcom in it. She and her husband, Graham Linehan (Father Ted, The IT Crowd), approached another writing team, Sharon Horgan and Holly Walsh, who had separately been working on a pilot with similar themes for US television. \u201cWe wrote a show for a US network about a mother who was struggling, fucking up, getting it wrong,\u201d explains Horgan. \u201cBy the time we came to shoot it she was 60% less of a mess. So it was 60% less funny. I think at that time there wasn\u2019t an appetite for mothers on screen who were saying this is all wrong or kicking back.\u201d The four joined forces around their common idea. Unlike the many, less funny, family sitcoms that came before, Motherland would not be a show about how mothers relate to their offspring, or how mothers relate to fathers (both the children and the nominal co-parents are mostly off-screen). It would be about how mothers relate to each other. Maybe the day-to-day business of mothering is too boring for television, but motherhood? That\u2019s one of the most fascinating \u2013 and funny \u2013 life experiences there is. Three years on and Motherland\u2019s second series has started, with a third already commissioned. At the same time, an explosion of online parenting content \u2013 ranging from Insta-influencers to confessional \u201cslummy mummies\u201d \u2013 has helped both consolidate an audience for motherhood comedy and provide writers with a treasury of new material. Motherland is now one of several shows that present child-rearing from a woman\u2019s point of view. There are international takes, such as the Australian TV show The Letdown and Canadian series Workin\u2019 Moms; semi-autobiographical portraits of single motherhood, such as Pamela Adlon\u2019s Better Things and Frankie Shaw\u2019s SMILF; and even a sub-genre of heavily pregnant standup specials, including Ali Wong\u2019s Baby Cobra and Amy Schumer\u2019s Growing. The implicit promise of them all is that they will give it to us straight. Ali Wong on work-life balance, for instance: \u201cReal talk? I have a nanny. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s the answer. Yes, it\u2019s very unlikable and unpopular to broadcast that because not everybody can afford a nanny, it\u2019s super-expensive. Both me and my husband have to hustle. We have to work very hard to not take care of our child ourselves.\u201d In a relatively short time, motherhood has gone from a comedy blindspot to one of its favourite topics. For all the talk of funny women making waves, this might be the most compelling evidence yet of real progress towards equality: not only are women more numerous in creative roles, they have the power to get shows made about topics relevant to them, whether or not the menfolk are also laughing. It is a trajectory that is also reflected in the Motherland writers\u2019 room, now that Graham, the show\u2019s sole male writer, has been replaced by writer-performer Barunka O\u2019Shaughnessy (Hunderby, Timewasters). Get four working mothers together in one room and you\u2019ll get four very different solutions to that hoary old conundrum: \u201cHow does she do it?\u201d Motherland\u2019s perspective is undeniably that of the comfortably-off London mum (it\u2019s set around Acton, west London) \u2013 but even within that specific stratum there are variations. Between the writers, they have children from toddler age to teens, experience of state and private schooling, stay-at-home parenting and various types of outsourced childcare. During the series, we\u2019re also reintroduced to super-stressed Julia who, early in season two, swaps a full-time event-planning job for working from home, but finds she\u2019s no less stressed. Alpha mum-turned-mumpreneur Amanda (Lucy Punch) might be more enviable if she wasn\u2019t so relentlessly judgmental about everyone else\u2019s choices. Single parent Liz (Diane Morgan) is a heroic source of dry wit and ingenious parenting shortcuts, but her income source remains mysterious. Then there\u2019s Kevin (Paul Ready), the stay-at-home dad who\u2019s recently taken on some work at soft-play centre Kiddiverse. \u201cIt\u2019s really great!\u201d he tells Liz during a school gate catch-up. \u201cPart-time, so I can still drop the kids, very average wage so Jill doesn\u2019t feel threatened \u2026 whole package, really!\u201d For the second series, Motherland\u2019s horizons have been further expanded by the introduction of a new character. \u201cWhen I came, what I thought was missing was a character who\u2019s able to do everything,\u201d says O\u2019Shaughnessy. \u201cSo for me it was more about: well, who is this extraordinary character? And what can we do with her that makes her sort of slightly fallible.\u201d By this point the other writers had noticed an omission, too: people of colour. Series two introduces Meg (played by black British actor Tanya Moodie), a high-flying businesswoman who has five children. \u201cY\u2019know, that sort of Nicola Horlick template of motherhood,\u201d says O\u2019Shaughnessy. \u201cYou\u2019re always looking for a chink in their armour, because you\u2019re always comparing yourself.\u201d The introduction of Meg goes some way to pre-empting any criticism of Motherland\u2019s narrow focus but, as O\u2019Shaughnessy acknowledges, there is a limit: \u201cI think if you want to tell a different side to motherhood you have to go to a different area and into a different class or, whatever, background, and you can cover that \u2026 There are other shows that are about the more vulnerable end of being a parent in this world but that\u2019s not our remit.\u201d If Motherland\u2019s creators seem anxious to do their bit for inclusivity, that\u2019s understandable. You don\u2019t need to spend much time on Mumsnet to realise that the same properties that make motherhood such a bounteous topic for comedy also make it a touchy one. The \u201cmommy wars\u201d rumble on, on various fronts (breastfeeding v bottle-feeding, stay-at-home v working, sugar-free v reality etc), emotions run high and everyone is sleep-deprived. Even in the manuals and blogs designed to support parents, generalised observations can feel like personal digs. \u201cIt upsets me when we\u2019re not united in saying it\u2019s fucking hard,\u201d says Horgan. \u201cA girl at my daughter\u2019s school told her that her mum was worried I didn\u2019t spend enough time with my daughter and she just \u2018wishes\u2019 I was around more. Seriously, you take one job away from home four years ago! Anyway, now I want to give her a one-inch punch in her judge-y chops. Y\u2019know, I thought it was sort of funny. But I also thought that that kind of thing is so unhelpful. And feeding into a sort of sexist bias that puts all the responsibility on the mother, to be a certain type or project a certain image. Fuck that. Stick together and support each other. Your daughters need to see that.\u201d And don\u2019t forget about the dads. Paul Ready, who plays Kevin, says he pushed to ensure that his character gets to \u201cwin a bit more\u201d this season. \u201cSocially, if the world is changing and we need more stay-at-home dads and there\u2019s going to be proper equality, then I think it\u2019s dangerous to have a stay-at-home dad who is just the butt of the joke,\u201d he says. Rest assured that Kevin\u2019s desperation to be part of the mum-crowd is still the butt of many jokes, and probably always will be. \u201cI think he always has to slightly lose,\u201d says Ready, \u201cor he wouldn\u2019t be Kevin any more.\u201d The brutal reality of school-gate society is that excluding those who don\u2019t fit is an essential bonding ritual, and this is at the very core of Motherland. Indeed, excluding outsiders (all the characters are outsiders, in some sense) might be the only group-bonding method strong enough to bring together women who, as Walsh has joked, \u201chave nothing in common except the fact that you all had unprotected sex on the same weekend\u201d. That explains how the mud-flecked, military-influenced motto \u201cNo mum left behind\u201d gets taken up as series two\u2019s sometimes ironic, sometimes earnest rallying cry. \u201cI\u2019ve read a lot of scripts lately dealing with these themes \u2013 the difficult, painful, often hilarious reality of parenting,\u201d says Lucy Punch, who plays Amanda. \u201cI think there\u2019s a trend and need in our culture right now for authenticity and honesty, not just in comedy \u2026 Those fantasy worlds that [once] existed \u2026 wouldn\u2019t feel relevant or work in the same way now.\u201d Not for Motherland, then, the mysteriously baby-free brunching of Sex and the City, or the perfectly coiffed labours of Friends. Instead, this season features those half-term holidays that end up being no kind of holiday at all, the manic #mumdrunk hedonism of a rare night out and the sweaty guilt of missing sports day. How does Motherland transform such recognisably stressful events into an enjoyable half-hour of weeknight comedy? It\u2019s a question Linehan once asked herself: \u201cI thought: \u2018Would I want to sit down with a glass of wine and watch this? After wrangling my kids all day?\u2019\u201d Somehow it works, and Linehan has a theory: \u201cHopefully, it\u2019s just so extreme you think: \u2018Oh, thank God my life isn\u2019t like that!\u2019 When, actually, it nearly is.\u201d Motherland is on Mondays, BBC Two, 10pm",

      "body": "<p>When Alan Wright* decided to take the plunge and spend \u00a32,800 on new hearing aids, he thought he was buying a significant upgrade on his old NHS-provided models.</p> <p>The 70-year-old, who had largely given up going to the theatre and other similar activities due to being quite deaf in one ear, hoped that by spending the money he would be able to start going out again.</p> <p>But instead of a new freedom, he and his wife Angela say they have endured 18 months of frustration as the hearing aids spent more time at the Specsavers hearing centre in Solihull than in his ears. In the end the couple became so disillusioned with the Widex aids that they demanded their money back.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a lot of money but we thought it would be worth it to improve his quality of life,\u201d says Angela. \u201cAfter 18 months of repeatedly having to return the aids, which would only work for a short time, he has now gone back to using his NHS version. We now wish we had saved our money.\u201d</p> <p>The couple may have just been unlucky and, after Guardian Money intervened, Specsavers refunded the couple in full. It repeated its view that neither it, nor the manufacturer, could find any problems with Wright\u2019s hearing aids.</p> <p>However, his case, and others like it, raise important questions about when and if consumers should use one of the growing number of private firms that dominate the private hearing aid sector, or stick with the NHS. The dilemma is exacerbated by the fact that consumers face a bewildering range of aids to improve hearing \u2013 and a huge range of prices.</p> <p>The consumer group Which?, one of the few bodies that has investigated this area and come up with an <a href=\"https://www.which.co.uk/reviews/hearing-aid-providers/article/how-to-get-the-best-hearing-aid/hearing-aid-features-explained\" title=\"\">excellent guide</a>, found in 2018 that the average amount spent on a pair of hearing aids was \u00a32,613. It is not uncommon for someone to spend \u00a35,000 on the most technically advanced models, which may only last three to five years.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7520d32e4bc8e2c9c4ba4284b4d839317dddbac1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7520d32e4bc8e2c9c4ba4284b4d839317dddbac1/0_448_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Senior man with hearing aidPG6899 Senior man with hearing aid\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Users who are having their first aid fitted should not expect it to work perfectly immediately.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Westend61 GmbH/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When Which? asked its readers to rate their private hearing aid purchases, the highest score of 87% was awarded by those who had used an independent retailer. Boots Hearingcare was rated the best of the big-name firms with a score of 79%, while Amplifon and Specsavers scored 74% and 71% respectively. Scrivens was lowest at 62%.</p> <p>Francesca Oliver, audiology specialist at the charity <a href=\"https://www.actiononhearingloss.org.uk/hearing-health/hearing-loss-and-deafness/hearing-aids-and-other-treatments/hearing-aids/\" title=\"\">Action on Hearing Loss</a> (formerly the RNID), says people tend to put this off and wait far too long \u2013 typically 10 years \u2013 before seeking <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/feb/11/new-hearing-aid-life-changing-experience-actor\" title=\"\">help with their hearing</a>. She advises those needing help to start with the NHS to see what\u2019s being offered before venturing into the private sector.</p> <p>\u201cPeople appear to assume they will face long waits and be given old-fashioned hearing aids, but it is not the case. All the aids now provided by the NHS are digital and, while they tend to be the bigger behind-the-ear options, they are a proven technology that generally works.\u201d</p> <p>She says most people will need a GP examination and subsequent referral to an NHS audiologist. The charity\u2019s most recent research found that patients are mostly given a hearing aid within six weeks of being seen. In many cases the patient will be seen by one of the private firms that operate on the NHS\u2019s behalf.</p> <p>Oliver warns users who are having their first aid fitted not to expect it to work perfectly immediately, as it takes time for the brain to adjust. As a result, return trips to the audiologist will often be required so it can be fine-tuned.</p> <p>\u201cIf you are going to venture into the private sector, I would strongly urge you to do your homework first. You should use a <a href=\"https://www.hcpc-uk.org/\" title=\"\">Health and Care Professions Council</a>-accredited audiologist, and ideally use a firm that offers a decent, free trial period or money-back guarantee. You could spend thousands of pounds on a privately provided small aid but not notice a huge hearing difference,\u201d she says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c84339bcc7623f112fee8ccfcd8696b90bde01d5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c84339bcc7623f112fee8ccfcd8696b90bde01d5/0_448_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Young woman with hearing aid taking selfie with smartphone\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In-ear hearing aids can be more discreet than traditional behind-the-ear models.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Westend61 GmbH/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Most people go private to gain a smaller, more discreet in-ear aid, which in the past have been less available on the NHS. The very latest privately offered aids will come with hi-tech features such as phone links and apps, and are marketed as being more comfortable.</p> <p>The traditional behind-the-ear aids may be the most obtrusive; however they are versatile and reliable. While the in-the-canal and completely in-the-ear \u201cinvisible\u201d aids may look much better, they tend to need repairing more often and can be unsuitable for those who are prone to ear infections. They are also vulnerable to malfunctions because of sweat and wax build-up.</p> <p>Natalie Hitchins, Which? head of services, says it is important to note that the NHS buys its digital hearing aids from the same manufacturers as private providers.</p> <p>\u201cWhile it is probable that they won\u2019t be the very latest models, the technology will still be up to date. There are advantages to going private such as convenient appointments, and a wider choice of styles is likely. However, it\u2019s not a cheap option.\u201d</p> <p>The NHS/private dilemma is not helped by the fact that the jury is out in <a href=\"https://forums.moneysavingexpert.com/showthread.php?t=5772133#topofpage\" title=\"\">online debates</a>. For every person raving about their bought hearing aids, there are others who have returned to using NHS ones. The newest Siemens aids offered to NHS patients may be a factor in that, as this could represent a huge financial saving to the individual.</p> <p>What\u2019s been your experience of buying hearing aids privately, or using the NHS? Join the debate below the line.</p> <p>* <em>Alan and Angela Wright are not their real names.</em></p> <h2>\u2018A lot of people are buying expensive hidden hearing aids to keep their hearing loss a secret\u2019</h2> <p>Elaine Green from Suffolk is one of those who bought an \u201cinvisible\u201d in-ear hearing aid privately, only to later wish that she had gone to her doctor first.</p> <p>\u201cIt was about vanity. I realised that my hearing had declined but I didn\u2019t want others to know, so I told the man that I wanted the smallest, most discreet aid possible,\u201d she says.</p> <p>She went to a big-name chain and paid \u00a3700 for the aid, but says she almost immediately had problems with it, as sounds had become muffled.</p> <p>\u201cEventually I came to my senses and went to see my GP. The NHS audiologist did exactly the same test and came to exactly the same conclusion, but gave me a behind-the-ear hearing aid which she made up on the spot,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cTo be honest, it has been so much better. Sounds are no longer muffled, and though it can be seen by other people, I\u2019m getting over that. As a society we have to stop treating people who are deaf as stupid and accept that older people can\u2019t hear as well as they once could. A lot of people buying expensive hidden hearing aids are doing so because they want to keep their hearing loss a secret \u2013 I was one of them.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "When Alan Wright* decided to take the plunge and spend \u00a32,800 on new hearing aids, he thought he was buying a significant upgrade on his old NHS-provided models. The 70-year-old, who had largely given up going to the theatre and other similar activities due to being quite deaf in one ear, hoped that by spending the money he would be able to start going out again. But instead of a new freedom, he and his wife Angela say they have endured 18 months of frustration as the hearing aids spent more time at the Specsavers hearing centre in Solihull than in his ears. In the end the couple became so disillusioned with the Widex aids that they demanded their money back. \u201cIt was a lot of money but we thought it would be worth it to improve his quality of life,\u201d says Angela. \u201cAfter 18 months of repeatedly having to return the aids, which would only work for a short time, he has now gone back to using his NHS version. We now wish we had saved our money.\u201d The couple may have just been unlucky and, after Guardian Money intervened, Specsavers refunded the couple in full. It repeated its view that neither it, nor the manufacturer, could find any problems with Wright\u2019s hearing aids. However, his case, and others like it, raise important questions about when and if consumers should use one of the growing number of private firms that dominate the private hearing aid sector, or stick with the NHS. The dilemma is exacerbated by the fact that consumers face a bewildering range of aids to improve hearing \u2013 and a huge range of prices. The consumer group Which?, one of the few bodies that has investigated this area and come up with an excellent guide, found in 2018 that the average amount spent on a pair of hearing aids was \u00a32,613. It is not uncommon for someone to spend \u00a35,000 on the most technically advanced models, which may only last three to five years. When Which? asked its readers to rate their private hearing aid purchases, the highest score of 87% was awarded by those who had used an independent retailer. Boots Hearingcare was rated the best of the big-name firms with a score of 79%, while Amplifon and Specsavers scored 74% and 71% respectively. Scrivens was lowest at 62%. Francesca Oliver, audiology specialist at the charity Action on Hearing Loss (formerly the RNID), says people tend to put this off and wait far too long \u2013 typically 10 years \u2013 before seeking help with their hearing. She advises those needing help to start with the NHS to see what\u2019s being offered before venturing into the private sector. \u201cPeople appear to assume they will face long waits and be given old-fashioned hearing aids, but it is not the case. All the aids now provided by the NHS are digital and, while they tend to be the bigger behind-the-ear options, they are a proven technology that generally works.\u201d She says most people will need a GP examination and subsequent referral to an NHS audiologist. The charity\u2019s most recent research found that patients are mostly given a hearing aid within six weeks of being seen. In many cases the patient will be seen by one of the private firms that operate on the NHS\u2019s behalf. Oliver warns users who are having their first aid fitted not to expect it to work perfectly immediately, as it takes time for the brain to adjust. As a result, return trips to the audiologist will often be required so it can be fine-tuned. \u201cIf you are going to venture into the private sector, I would strongly urge you to do your homework first. You should use a Health and Care Professions Council-accredited audiologist, and ideally use a firm that offers a decent, free trial period or money-back guarantee. You could spend thousands of pounds on a privately provided small aid but not notice a huge hearing difference,\u201d she says. Most people go private to gain a smaller, more discreet in-ear aid, which in the past have been less available on the NHS. The very latest privately offered aids will come with hi-tech features such as phone links and apps, and are marketed as being more comfortable. The traditional behind-the-ear aids may be the most obtrusive; however they are versatile and reliable. While the in-the-canal and completely in-the-ear \u201cinvisible\u201d aids may look much better, they tend to need repairing more often and can be unsuitable for those who are prone to ear infections. They are also vulnerable to malfunctions because of sweat and wax build-up. Natalie Hitchins, Which? head of services, says it is important to note that the NHS buys its digital hearing aids from the same manufacturers as private providers. \u201cWhile it is probable that they won\u2019t be the very latest models, the technology will still be up to date. There are advantages to going private such as convenient appointments, and a wider choice of styles is likely. However, it\u2019s not a cheap option.\u201d The NHS/private dilemma is not helped by the fact that the jury is out in online debates. For every person raving about their bought hearing aids, there are others who have returned to using NHS ones. The newest Siemens aids offered to NHS patients may be a factor in that, as this could represent a huge financial saving to the individual. What\u2019s been your experience of buying hearing aids privately, or using the NHS? Join the debate below the line. * Alan and Angela Wright are not their real names. \u2018A lot of people are buying expensive hidden hearing aids to keep their hearing loss a secret\u2019 Elaine Green from Suffolk is one of those who bought an \u201cinvisible\u201d in-ear hearing aid privately, only to later wish that she had gone to her doctor first. \u201cIt was about vanity. I realised that my hearing had declined but I didn\u2019t want others to know, so I told the man that I wanted the smallest, most discreet aid possible,\u201d she says. She went to a big-name chain and paid \u00a3700 for the aid, but says she almost immediately had problems with it, as sounds had become muffled. \u201cEventually I came to my senses and went to see my GP. The NHS audiologist did exactly the same test and came to exactly the same conclusion, but gave me a behind-the-ear hearing aid which she made up on the spot,\u201d she says. \u201cTo be honest, it has been so much better. Sounds are no longer muffled, and though it can be seen by other people, I\u2019m getting over that. As a society we have to stop treating people who are deaf as stupid and accept that older people can\u2019t hear as well as they once could. A lot of people buying expensive hidden hearing aids are doing so because they want to keep their hearing loss a secret \u2013 I was one of them.\u201d",

The village, one of three that make up Val Gardena, has Tirolean-style architecture and a family-friendly vibe.

      "bodyText": "SWITZERLAND Nendaz This delightful old Valais village, with its timber houses, barns and grain stores, is part of the Quatre Vall\u00e9es ski region, made up of Verbier, Veysonnaz, Nendaz and Thyon. There\u2019s 412km of pistes, plus 12km of cross-country ski trails, 100km of winter hiking trails and 40km of snowshoe tracks. So even if you don\u2019t do downhill skiing or snowboarding there\u2019s plenty for you. Be sure to check out the glacier on Mont-Fort, from where the view encompasses peaks including the Matterhorn and Mont Blanc. Experts skiers won\u2019t be disappointed by the challenges, with seven marked freeride areas that include Eteygeon and Plan-du-Fou, and the deserted descent at the back of Mont-Fort. By train: 9\u00be hours Depart London St Pancras on the 06.18 Eurostar to Paris Gare du Nord; change to Paris Gare de Lyon and take the 11.56 TGV to Lausanne and then take the 15.50 InterRegio train to Sion, arriving at 16.57. From there it\u2019s 25 minutes by bus or taxi. Return fares from \u00a3165. Stay Hotel Mont Fort (doubles from \u20ac144 B&amp;B) has a spacious bar and lounge. Adelboden In the picturesque Bernese Oberland, this beautiful village has a loyal following of people who appreciate the blend of spectacular scenery, intermediate-friendly slopes and unfussy charm. There\u2019s 86km of piste, straddling the peaks to the resort of Lenk, with outlying resorts (accessed by bus) notching the total terrain area up to 200km. Many hotels here take pride in their spa facilities, knowing that the laid-back vibe of the village lends itself to long soaks and pampering. Restaurant Aebi is in a spectacular 220-year-old farmhouse with a vast sun terrace, but in snowy weather, seek out the cosy Chuenisbargli at the top of the World Cup run, which serves traditional Swiss dishes \u2013 it\u2019s renowned for its fondue. By train 8\u00bd hours Depart London St Pancras on the 07.55 Eurostar to Paris Gare du Nord; change to Paris Gare de Lyon and take the 12.23 TGV to Basel, the 15.31 InterCity to Berne and the 16.39 RegionalExpress to Frutigen, arriving at 17.24.

Engelberg This resort in the Lake Lucerne region is a mecca for powder-crazy freeriders. The 3,020-metre Titlis glacier is served by a rotating gondola with a 360-degree view and 1980s classics on the speaker system. The unique topography allows for the possibility of an incredible powder descent, dropping a total of 2,000 vertical metres back to the village, best and most safely done with an instructor or mountain guide, of course. There\u2019s also 66km of pistes, with plenty of decent terrain suitable for beginners and intermediates. There are also several sledging routes, including a 3.5km trail through the snowy Gerschniwald forest, a huge natural ice rink. The huge Benedictine Monastry, which towers above the village and dates from 1120, does guided tours. By train: 10 hours Depart London St Pancras on the 07.52 Eurostar to Paris Gare du Nord; change to Paris Gare de Lyon and take the 12.23 TGV to Basel, then the 16.17 InterRegional train to Luzern and then the 18.10 InterRegional train to Engelberg, arriving at 18.53. Return fares from \u00a3206. Stay Hotel Bellevue Terminus has quirky arthouse design and is centrally situated, with doubles from \u20ac142 B&amp;B. Villars With a cog mountain railway all of its own, a variety of ski slopes and plenty going on outside of the skiing, Villars has the kind of rounded feel that makes it an attractive resort for families in particular. The town\u2019s relaxed, old-school vibe means the emphasis is on eating as much as skiing. But there are some gems on the slopes here, one of the best runs being the Combe d\u2019Audon, with a dramatic cliff face rising up on the right. On a linked ski pass are the neighbouring resorts of Les Diablerets, with its 3,000-metre glacier, and Leysin. Often overlooked here are great freeriding possibilities too. So if some of your party insist on a long lunch, others can break off and come back bragging about the untouched powder they found. By train:9 hours Depart London St Pancras on the 07.31 Eurostar to Paris Gare du Nord; change to Paris Gare de Lyon and take the 11.57 TGV to Geneva and then the 16.12 InterRegio train to Aigle, arriving at 17.22. From there it\u2019s 20 minutes by bus or taxi. Return fares from \u00a3164. Stay Alpe Fleurie (doubles from \u00a3130 room-only) is a friendly, old-school Swiss chalet. FRANCE La Plagne The slope-side location of much of the accommodation in the 12 villages that make up the resort of La Plagne means you can clip on your skis and moments later be exploring the 425km of pistes of the huge Paradiski ski area. With 70% of the terrain above 2,000 metres, La Plagne is a good choice for early and late season trips. There\u2019s also a 22-metre ice-climbing wall in Champagny, cheese fondue nights (\u20ac29pp) at the Igloo Village restaurant above Plagne Bellec\u00f4te, and a converted piste-bashing machine complete with jacuzzi that you can spend the night in (\u20ac320 B&amp;B for two). The village of Belle Plagne has a Deep Nature spa, with outdoor pool and treatments from \u20ac49. In the second week of April, the Subli\u2019Cimes festival, spread across five peaks, offers games and magic shows for children, concerts, silent discos and hot tubs. By train: 8 hours Depart London St Pancras on the Saturdays-only 09.45 Eurostar ski train to Aime la Plagne, arriving at 18.46. From there it\u2019s 30-40 minutes by taxi or bus. Return fares from \u00a3160. Stay The seven-room Hotel Le Cocoon (doubles from \u20ac150 B&amp;B) at Plagne 1800 has a boutique feel and views of Mont Blanc. Les Gets Les Gets is part of the vast Portes du Soleil ski area, with 600km of pistes, but the resort\u2019s own mountain, Mont Ch\u00e9ry, has blissfully quiet slopes. The village itself is a charmer, dotted with Savoyarde chalet buildings. This season a new spa and wellness centre, Les Sources du Ch\u00e9ry, will open at the foot of the slopes, for a \u201cski-in/chill-out\u201d experience. The resort is also introducing dog sledding for two- to 12-year-olds, following a trail though the Mont Caly area with musher Didier. In the evenings, a new speakeasy-style restaurant, Les Durs \u00e0 Cuire, has menus in 1930s newspaper style, with tantalising items such as seven-hour lamb and forbidden cheesecake. By train: 9\u00be hours Depart London St Pancras on the 07.52 Eurostar to Paris Gare du Nord; change to Paris Gare de Lyon for the 12.45 TGV to Annecy, then the 17.32 TER train to Cluses, arriving at 18.36. From there it\u2019s 30 minutes by bus or taxi. Return fares from \u00a3145. Stay Hotel Alpina (doubles from \u20ac106 room-only) has a pool, jacuzzi, sauna and hammam. Meribel In 1936, a keen Scottish skier called Peter Lindsay founded a ski resort that has been a magnet for Brits ever since. Part of the appeal is the resort\u2019s enviable position at the heart of the Three Valleys ski area, with 600km of pistes and 180 lifts. You can ski here all day every day for a week and still feel you\u2019ve barely scratched the surface. One of the most charming villages to be based at is Les Allues, just 11km from Moutiers train station. The village is a pleasure to wander around, with its stone walls and Savoyard chalets, many of them run by small British operators. In Les Allues, the Tsaretta bar and restaurant hosts regular gigs and attracts a friendly mix of locals, seasonal workers and holidaymakers, while nearby in Meribel centre there are plenty of watering holes for those seeking a late night out. By train: 7\u00be hours Depart London St Pancras on the 09.45 direct Eurostar Ski Train to Moutiers, arriving at 18.27. From there it\u2019s around 30 minutes by taxi or bus. Return fares from \u00a3160. Stay Ski Blanc has six cute catered chalets close to the gondola lift in Les Allues from \u00a3469pp a week for two. Tignes Gaze out at the panorama from the 3,456-metre Grande Motte glacier, then throw yourself into the 1,350-metre vertical descent \u2013 and Tignes\u2019s popularity with intermediate and advanced skiers will be abundantly clear. High-altitude, snowsure slopes make this an ideal playground for those who love to clock up the miles on exhilarating terrain. But it\u2019s not all about the skiing here. You can try your hand as a husky dog-sled musher with three hounds pulling you along for an exhilarating, heartwarming \u2013 and somewhat unpredictable \u2013 ride. There\u2019s also horse riding on snow, and snowtubing, where you descend on inflated tubes at up to 45km/h, and a \u201cmagic carpet\u201d takes you effortlessly back to the top to do it again. In the evenings, new apr\u00e8s-ski bar Cocorico has a terrace with live bands and DJs. By train: 9\u00bd hours Depart London St Pancras on the direct 19.45 Eurostar to Bourg-St-Maurice (Fridays only), arriving at 06.16. From there it\u2019s 45 minutes by taxi or bus. Return fares from \u00a3160. Stay Chardons\u2019 catered Chalet Amelie in Tignes Les Brevi\u00e8res, has a hot tub and is 50 metres from the lifts from \u00a3525pp a week. Vaujany This small village has access to a sizeable amount of ski terrain: the 250km Alpe d\u2019Huez domaine. Its position at the western end of the ski area means the local slopes stay remarkably quiet \u2013 so much so that you may find yourself exchanging a nod or wave with passing skiers, as if it would be rude not to. Rustic restaurants such as La Bergerie, off the side of the Villarais piste, is the perfect stop after a powder run, and Chalet du Lac Besson, towards Huez, does meat grilled on an open fire. Evenings in Vaujany are quiet but the Folie Douce apr\u00e8s-ski bar, above Alpe d\u2019Huez is a good stop before a home run. In the village, families will love the recently built leisure complex, with its pool, spa and waterslides. By train: 6\u00bc hours Depart London St Pancras on the 10.24 Eurostar to Paris Gare du Nord; change to Paris Gare de Lyon and take the 14.38 TGV to Grenoble, arriving at 17.45. From there it\u2019s 50 minutes by bus or taxi. Return fares from \u00a3108. Stay Meals at Ski Peak\u2019s Chalet Saskia are by renowned resident chef Marcus Cull, from \u20ac899pp a week. Val Cenis Not far from Modane station on the TGV route between Paris and Turin/Milan, is the resort of Val Cenis, which has three village bases to choose from: Lanslebourg, Lanslevillard and Termignon. These all access a combined 125km of very scenic terrain, overlooking the Lac du Mont-Cenis. It\u2019s a far cry from the hustle and bustle of big purpose-built resorts, and as such will suit young families and those who appreciate laid-back Savoyarde life. There\u2019s plenty of terrain to keep intermediates entertained here, too, and the resort has an excellent snow record. The evening scene is restaurant focused, with places such as L\u2019Arcelle, Le Terroir Savoyard and Ta Ta\u2019tine serving hearty mountain dishes. And to discover more about the local Beaufort cheese, the Fromagerie Coop\u00e9rative de Haute Maurienne Vanoise opens its doors to show visitors how it\u2019s produced. By train: 8\u00bc hours Depart London St Pancras on the 09.24 Eurostar to Paris Gare du Nord; change to Paris Gare de Lyon and take the 14.41 TGV to Modane, arriving at 18.47.

Stay The Les Chalets de Flambeau apartments, with indoor pool and spa, from \u00a3341pp in a one-bedroom apartment (sleeps up to four) for seven nights with Erna Low. Les Arcs It\u2019s no wonder Les Arcs attracts a loyal following. The layout of the slopes allows learners to cruise easy smooth blue runs at high altitude, while the sheer variety of the slopes make it a compelling resort for mile-munching intermediate and experienced skiers. This year, the funicular that connects Bourg-St-Maurice station to the village of Arc 1600 in just seven minutes has been completely renovated. The new trains have panoramic windows front and back with views over the valley. The focus on rail access is part of a sustainability programme that includes solar panels on the Aiguille Rouge and Varet lift stations and the slowing of chairlifts to save energy during quiet periods. The new Folie Douce apr\u00e8s-ski bar at Arc 1800 will use waste heat from refrigeration to heat the building. By train: 8\u00bc hours Depart London St Pancras on the 09.45 Eurostar direct to Bourg-St-Maurice (Saturdays only, book well in advance), arriving at 19.03. From there it\u2019s seven minutes by funicular to Arc 1600, with connecting buses to the other villages (15\u201330 minutes). Return fares from \u00a3160. Stay Ski Collection offers a week in the ski-in/ski-out Le Village apartments in Arc 1950, which have an outdoor pool and spa, from \u00a3472pp. Morzine When it comes to that peculiarly wonderful invention the catered chalet, Morzine is king. There are handsome examples all over the village, many of them converted farmhouses with rustic quirks, the oldest dating from 1771. Many of the chalet operators are small, independent operators who attract return guests year after year to enjoy post-slope cake, canap\u00e9s, bubbling hot tubs and a home-from-home feel. The resort is in a prime position to explore the thigh-burning 650km Portes du Soleil ski area, with its tree-lined slopes and huge variety of terrain. In the evenings the village is buzzing, and in recent years microbreweries such as Ibex have sprung up. By train: 9\u00be hours Depart London St Pancras on the 07.52 Eurostar to Paris Gare du Nord; change to Paris Gare de Lyon and take the take the 12.45 TGV to Annecy, and then the 17.32 TER train to Cluses, arriving at 18.36. From there it\u2019s 40 minutes by bus or taxi. Return fares from \u00a3145. Stay Independent chalet company Alikats has stunning catered chalets with great catering from \u00a3600pp a week. Montgen\u00e8vre Few resorts do it better for beginners than this unpretentious village on the Italian border. Its gentle slopes fan out from the cafe-lined centre, making it easy for families to meet up after lessons. Intermediates will be in their element, too: the resort is part of the 400km Milky Way ski area. When the skiing is over, have a swim and soak in the impressive Durancia pool and spa complex. Restaurant menus are full of Italian influences; try the pizzas at Le Capitaine. Evenings in the resort are quiet, but cosy basement cocktail bar La Tourmente is popular with those who aren\u2019t quite ready for an early night \u2013 and has live bands, too. By train: 9 hours Depart London St Pancras on the 09.24 Eurostar to Paris Gare du Nord; change to Paris Gare de Lyon and take the 14.38 TGV to Oulx-Cesana-Clavi\u00e8re-Sestri\u00e8res, arriving at 19.23. From there it\u2019s 15 minutes by bus or taxi. Return fares from \u00a3109. Stay The attractively designed, piste-side Hotel Anova has doubles from \u20ac140 room-only and a spa, too. Le Grand-Bornand Situated in the stunning Aravis mountain range above Lake Annecy, Le Grand-Bornand\u2019s little village is steeped in old Savoyarde chalet-style buildings, the wood darkened from years in the sun. The slopes will get a five-star rating from families, because both beginners and more experienced skiers are amply catered for. There are 86km of pistes, or 211km if you include neighbouring Annecy resorts like La Clusaz. It feels like there\u2019s something for everyone, but in a setting that could not feel more relaxed \u2013 a world away from purpose-built and big-name resorts. This is also the birthplace of Reblochon cheese, and each week a different farm opens its doors to the \u2018\u201ccheese curious\u201d public for guided tours and tastings. By train: 7\u00be hours Depart London St Pancras on the 07.52 Eurostar to Paris Gare du Nord; change to Paris Gare de Lyon and take the 12.45 TGV to Annecy, arriving at 16.29.

Stay Lagrange offers the spacious Le Village de Lessy apartments, from \u00a3683 for seven nights for an apartment (sleeps up to four). AUSTRIA St Anton With its own railway station, St Anton has a long tradition of welcoming skiers by train. Whether you travel through the day or arrive in the morning by sleeper, the approach through the stunning Arlberg valley is the equivalent of canap\u00e9s before dinner, as Tirolean villages glide by and peaks rear up on either side. The vibe in St Anton is a smooth blend of tradition and frivolity. A must-visit is the History Museum, which traces the development of skiing, including period film footage. The restaurant in the museum\u2019s cavernous atrium is good, too. Some of the Alps\u2019 finest apr\u00e8s-ski huts line the pistes, attracting skiers on their home runs like moths to glowing lamps. Oh, and the skiing? A mere 305km of pistes, 88 lifts and 200km of freeriding terrain. By train: 10\u00bc hours Depart London St Pancras on the 07.52 Eurostar to Paris Gare du Nord; take the 12.22 TGV from Paris Gare de Lyon to Zurich, and from there the 16.40 RailJet, arriving at St Anton at 19.01. Return fares from \u00a3208. Stay Family-run B&amp;B the Alkira is 500 metres from the village centre, with doubles from \u20ac160 in January. Alpbach Arriving by sleeper train in this Tyrolean village is like waking up in a picture postcard. The village is one of the most beautiful in the Alps, with grand hotels and darkened wooden chalets lining quiet, winding streets. A gondola built two winters ago that links Alpbach with the Wildsch\u00f6nau valley has created the Ski Juwel area, comprising the resorts of Reith, Oberau and Niederau \u2013 145km of pistes in total. For families with young children, the beginner slopes in the centre of the village are very convenient. And there\u2019s plenty of good eating on the slopes, at restaurants like the B\u00f6glalm \u2013 famous for its Gulaschsuppe, Kasspazl (cheesy pasta) and Gr\u00f6stl (bacon, potato and onion fry-up) \u2013 or with panoramic views at the 2,030-metre Wiedersbergerhorn Hutte. By train: 16\u00be hours Depart London St Pancras on the 15.04 Eurostar to Brussels, and then switch to the adjacent platform to take the 18.25 ICE to Cologne; then take the 22.36 Alpen Express to Jenbach, arriving 08.50.

S\u00f6ll This fun, friendly Tyrolean village is a short hop from Kufstein station, between Salzburg and Innsbruck. Travelling by overnight train gives you more time in the massive Skiwelt ski area and could save you accommodation costs for a night. The slopes are particularly suited to mile-hungry intermediates, with an efficient network of bubble and chairlifts. The most remarkable peak is the Hohe Salve, with its unparalleled vista over the Wilderkaiser mountain range. At this 1,829-metre summit you can have lunch on the revolving, sunny terrace of the Gipfelrestaurant, with views of more than 70 peaks over 3,000 metres high. Younger skiers will love popping in to see the resident skiing \u201cwitches\u201d who, in keeping with a local legend, cast spells and brew potions in a hut, the Simonalm, on Hochs\u00f6ll. Down in the village there\u2019s a good supply of restaurants and bars, with the cavernous, beamed Moonlight Bar a popular spot. By train: 19\u00bc hours Depart London St Pancras on the 11.04 Eurostar to Amsterdam arriving at 16.11, then take the 18.59 Alpen Express to Kufstein arriving 07.22; from there it\u2019s 20 minutes by bus or taxi.

Zell am See and Kaprun Set above the magnificent Lake See, this handsome Austrian village has a pedestrianised centre, and a railway station. The distinctive altstadt (old town) has some buzzing bars, plenty of restaurants and a gothic church. The ski area is shared with the neighbouring village of Kaprun, close to the Kitzsteinhorn glacier, which this year will be linked by a new gondola, the 3K K-onnection, to the ski area of Maiskogel, after an eye-watering outlay of more than \u20ac80m. The igloo village, with its impressive ice sculptures and ice bar, is well worth a visit after or between runs. And for real adrenalin junkies, the new Black Mamba run from the glacier has angles of 32 degrees. By train: 22 hours Depart London St Pancras on the 11.04 Eurostar to Amsterdam, arriving 16.11; then take the 18.59 Alpen Express to Zell am See, arriving 09.55. Return fares from \u00a3229. Stay The elegant Hotel Steinerwirt (doubles from \u20ac158) is a stone\u2019s throw from the station. ITALY Sauze d\u2019Oulx If you love carving your way along tree-lined slopes and hunting down mountain restaurants, the slopes of Sauze d\u2019Oulx won\u2019t disappoint. Hidden in wooded enclaves are rustic huts such as Caio Paix, which serves delicious homemade cakes. The resort is part of the vast Milky Way ski area, with 400km of pistes shared with Sestriere, Sansicario and, further afield, Claviere and Montgen\u00e8vre. Beginners will enjoy the Sportinia area, with its gentle sweeping runs. The village has a cobbled centre and plentiful places to eat. A good place to begin is the sunlit terrace of the Assietta hotel. A number of restaurants compete to serve the best pizza, among them La Griglia, in the arches of an old townhouse. The resort has long shaken off its 1980s reputation as a magnet for boozy package holidays; now the atmosphere is friendly and vibrant rather than wild. By train: 9 hours Depart London St Pancras on the 09.24 Eurostar to Paris Gare du Nord; change to Paris Gare de Lyon and take the 14.41 TGV to Oulx, arriving at 19.23.

Two of the flats have balconies with wooden balustrades that have rotted over time, says Mestre, who has lived in her flat for just over two years and pays a service charge of more than \u00a31,400 a year. Her and her husband\u2019s share of the bill is \u00a35,883.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In a nutshell they left the two wooden balconies to rot, and are trying to get us to replace them with metal balconies for \u00a331,000.</p> <footer> <cite>Kate Farmer Mestre, owner</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cWhy are we picking up the tab for them not doing their work?\u201d says Farmer Mestre. She says the cost of dealing with this would be \u201cnowhere near as bad\u201d if the balconies had been properly maintained.</p> <p>A firm of building surveyors commissioned by the property managers to inspect the block in October 2018 reported that \u201cthe timber balustrades \u2026 are showing signs of timber decay\u201d. Their report recommended replacing these \u201cas soon as possible given the health and safety issue this presents\u201d.</p> <p>The lease places an obligation on the landlord \u201cin every fourth year \u2026 [to] paint with two coats at least of good quality paint all parts of the exterior of the building\u201d. However, Feldman, who took ownership of one of the balcony flats in January 2015 and lives there with her husband and daughter, says that to her knowledge, no painting or maintenance has been done to her flat\u2019s balcony since then.</p> <p>Farmer Mestre says she has spoken to the previous property managers and to other residents, and that as far as she is aware, there has only been one occasion \u2013 in 2013 \u2013 when external repair and redecoration work was carried out.</p> <p>Last week, in a \u201cletter before action\u201d to Freehold Managers, the residents of five of the six flats said that, based on legal advice they had received, \u201cthe balcony balustrades form part of the exterior of the building, and therefore the responsibility to maintain them lies with the landlord\u201d.</p> <p>The letter added that despite the obligation in the lease, the reporting of damage and the 2018 report recommendation, no maintenance had taken place for some time. \u201cWe therefore claim you breached the positive covenant, causing the state of the balcony balustrade to deteriorate over time. As a result this has become costlier to remedy, and you the freeholder must bear the resulting costs,\u201d it said.</p> <p>The report quotes \u00a34,500 to \u201cremove/replace existing balustrades\u201d. However in July, the property managers, Hurford Salvi Carr (HSC), sent out letters putting the total estimated cost of the work including fees and VAT at \u00a331,376. In September the individual invoices arrived.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3b20d2f8598fd9e45f88dc86742ebbbe65d53a8e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3b20d2f8598fd9e45f88dc86742ebbbe65d53a8e/1033_0_4231_5289/800.jpg\" alt=\"Kate Farmer Mestre and Nina Feldman with her child.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kate Farmer Mestre and Nina Feldman with her child.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alecsandra Raluca Dragoi/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Farmer Mestre says: \u201cIn a nutshell they left the two wooden balconies to rot, and are trying to get us to replace them with metal balconies for \u00a331,000.\u201d</p> <p>While there are clearly problems with some of the wood, is a costly upgrade essential? In an August 2019 email to Feldman, an HSC employee said that, based on the surveyor\u2019s report, \u201cit appears that the balconies, bar the balustrades, were in good overall condition\u201d.</p> <p>Farmer Mestre says conversations are taking place about whether the leaseholders could attempt to exercise their right to manage the block or buy the freehold.</p> <p>Freehold Managers is ultimately owned by a company called Euro Investments Inc, controlled by the Tchenguiz Family Trust.</p> <p>In a statement, Freehold Managers said: \u201cHSC were appointed as property managers in May 2018, with responsibility for maintenance. We take complaints very seriously and are in touch with the residents at [the flats] to address their concerns. However, the balconies do need to be replaced as they are over 15 years old and currently out of use, and could in future pose a risk.\u201d</p> <p>In a letter replying to the residents, Freehold Managers said the \u00a34,500 figure related to the materials alone, and was revised to \u00a36,000 in May this year, and then to \u00a39,505, which \u201cincluded using steel material in place of timber, which should increase the life of the balconies and reduce future maintenance needs\u201d.</p> <p>The letter said: \u201cWe understand that maintenance works have taken place on the balconies in recent years.\u201d It added: \u201cHSC need to proceed with the works which are necessary.\u201d</p> <h2>How to take back control</h2> <p>During the last few years there has been a huge outcry about the way some leaseholders have been exploited by unfair contracts and excessive fees, which have left some homes virtually unsaleable.</p> <p>There are about 4.2m residential leasehold properties in England, of which about 2.9m are flats.</p> <p>Following a series of articles in the Guardian and elsewhere, the government has, since mid-2017, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jun/27/government-to-axe-leaseholds-for-new-build-homes\">announced a series of clampdowns on the sector</a> to tackle a range of issues.</p> <p>However, there are things flat dwellers can do now.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Buying the freehold</strong> Leaseholders have a legal right to act together to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/leasehold-property/buying-the-freehold\">buy their building\u2019s freehold</a>, provided they meet the qualifying criteria. This is known as <a href=\"https://www.lease-advice.org/lease-glossary/collective-enfranchisement/\" title=\"Glossary: Collective enfranchisement\">collective enfranchisement</a>. However, there are a lot of hurdles to jump \u2013 for example, the building has to qualify, plus there need to be enough \u201cqualifying tenants\u201d. The minimum number of participating tenants must equal half the total number of flats in the building. For more information go to the <a href=\"https://www.lease-advice.org/\">Leasehold Advisory Service</a>\u2019s website.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Ask a tribunal to appoint a new manager</strong> You must prove bad management if you want to do this - for example, you have to pay unreasonable service charges, or the landlord hasn\u2019t complied with an approved code of management practice. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/leasehold-property/right-to-manage-and-management-disputes\">There are different systems</a> depending on where you live in the UK \u2013 to find out more, go to gov.uk/leasehold-property</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Exercise your \u201cright to manage\u201d</strong> This lets you and the other leaseholders <a href=\"https://www.lease-advice.org/advice-guide/right-manage/\">take control of the management of the building</a> without having to prove bad management. You will need to find out if you qualify \u2013 for example, at least two-thirds of the flats must be let to qualifying tenants, and if there is a shop/restaurant etc in the building, it can\u2019t take up more than 25% of the total floor area. Contact the the Leasehold Advisory Service for advice. You and the other leaseholders can manage the building yourselves or pay a managing agent to do it.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The owners of six flats have been left reeling after being hit with a bill for \u00a331,000 from their landlord \u2013 for repairing two small wooden balconies which the residents claim had been left to rot through lack of maintenance. They also say the demand is almost seven times the \u00a34,500 figure for tackling the problem quoted in a report commissioned by the landlord. The \u00a331,376 bill \u2013 which includes various fees and works out at between \u00a35,000 and \u00a36,000 per flat \u2013 was described by one resident as \u201can insane amount of money \u2013 my carpenter friend burst out laughing when I told him\u201d. The residents allege their freeholder breached the terms of the lease by failing to look after the balconies, so should have to pick up the bill now that the problems have become costlier to put right. The landlord and freeholder is Freehold Managers plc, whose ultimate parent company is based in the British Virgin Islands in the Caribbean and controlled by the family trust of the multimillionaire property tycoon Vincent Tchenguiz. Responding to the allegations, Freehold Managers told Guardian Money that it takes residents\u2019 complaints seriously, but said the balconies needed to be replaced as they were more than 15 years old, were out of use, and could pose a health and safety risk. Kate Farmer Mestre and Nina Feldman (pictured) are among those living in the small apartment block in Stockwell, south London, which was built in 2002. Two of the flats have balconies with wooden balustrades that have rotted over time, says Mestre, who has lived in her flat for just over two years and pays a service charge of more than \u00a31,400 a year. Her and her husband\u2019s share of the bill is \u00a35,883. \u201cWhy are we picking up the tab for them not doing their work?\u201d says Farmer Mestre. She says the cost of dealing with this would be \u201cnowhere near as bad\u201d if the balconies had been properly maintained. A firm of building surveyors commissioned by the property managers to inspect the block in October 2018 reported that \u201cthe timber balustrades \u2026 are showing signs of timber decay\u201d. Their report recommended replacing these \u201cas soon as possible given the health and safety issue this presents\u201d. The lease places an obligation on the landlord \u201cin every fourth year \u2026 [to] paint with two coats at least of good quality paint all parts of the exterior of the building\u201d. However, Feldman, who took ownership of one of the balcony flats in January 2015 and lives there with her husband and daughter, says that to her knowledge, no painting or maintenance has been done to her flat\u2019s balcony since then. Farmer Mestre says she has spoken to the previous property managers and to other residents, and that as far as she is aware, there has only been one occasion \u2013 in 2013 \u2013 when external repair and redecoration work was carried out. Last week, in a \u201cletter before action\u201d to Freehold Managers, the residents of five of the six flats said that, based on legal advice they had received, \u201cthe balcony balustrades form part of the exterior of the building, and therefore the responsibility to maintain them lies with the landlord\u201d. The letter added that despite the obligation in the lease, the reporting of damage and the 2018 report recommendation, no maintenance had taken place for some time. \u201cWe therefore claim you breached the positive covenant, causing the state of the balcony balustrade to deteriorate over time. As a result this has become costlier to remedy, and you the freeholder must bear the resulting costs,\u201d it said. The report quotes \u00a34,500 to \u201cremove/replace existing balustrades\u201d. However in July, the property managers, Hurford Salvi Carr (HSC), sent out letters putting the total estimated cost of the work including fees and VAT at \u00a331,376. In September the individual invoices arrived. Farmer Mestre says: \u201cIn a nutshell they left the two wooden balconies to rot, and are trying to get us to replace them with metal balconies for \u00a331,000.\u201d While there are clearly problems with some of the wood, is a costly upgrade essential? In an August 2019 email to Feldman, an HSC employee said that, based on the surveyor\u2019s report, \u201cit appears that the balconies, bar the balustrades, were in good overall condition\u201d. Farmer Mestre says conversations are taking place about whether the leaseholders could attempt to exercise their right to manage the block or buy the freehold. Freehold Managers is ultimately owned by a company called Euro Investments Inc, controlled by the Tchenguiz Family Trust. In a statement, Freehold Managers said: \u201cHSC were appointed as property managers in May 2018, with responsibility for maintenance. We take complaints very seriously and are in touch with the residents at [the flats] to address their concerns. However, the balconies do need to be replaced as they are over 15 years old and currently out of use, and could in future pose a risk.\u201d In a letter replying to the residents, Freehold Managers said the \u00a34,500 figure related to the materials alone, and was revised to \u00a36,000 in May this year, and then to \u00a39,505, which \u201cincluded using steel material in place of timber, which should increase the life of the balconies and reduce future maintenance needs\u201d. The letter said: \u201cWe understand that maintenance works have taken place on the balconies in recent years.\u201d It added: \u201cHSC need to proceed with the works which are necessary.\u201d How to take back control During the last few years there has been a huge outcry about the way some leaseholders have been exploited by unfair contracts and excessive fees, which have left some homes virtually unsaleable. There are about 4.2m residential leasehold properties in England, of which about 2.9m are flats. Following a series of articles in the Guardian and elsewhere, the government has, since mid-2017, announced a series of clampdowns on the sector to tackle a range of issues. However, there are things flat dwellers can do now. \u2022 Buying the freehold Leaseholders have a legal right to act together to buy their building\u2019s freehold, provided they meet the qualifying criteria. This is known as collective enfranchisement. However, there are a lot of hurdles to jump \u2013 for example, the building has to qualify, plus there need to be enough \u201cqualifying tenants\u201d. The minimum number of participating tenants must equal half the total number of flats in the building. For more information go to the Leasehold Advisory Service\u2019s website. \u2022 Ask a tribunal to appoint a new manager You must prove bad management if you want to do this - for example, you have to pay unreasonable service charges, or the landlord hasn\u2019t complied with an approved code of management practice. There are different systems depending on where you live in the UK \u2013 to find out more, go to gov.uk/leasehold-property \u2022 Exercise your \u201cright to manage\u201d This lets you and the other leaseholders take control of the management of the building without having to prove bad management. You will need to find out if you qualify \u2013 for example, at least two-thirds of the flats must be let to qualifying tenants, and if there is a shop/restaurant etc in the building, it can\u2019t take up more than 25% of the total floor area. Contact the the Leasehold Advisory Service for advice. You and the other leaseholders can manage the building yourselves or pay a managing agent to do it.",

      "body": "<p>Sadiq Khan, the Labour mayor of London, has called on Jeremy Corbyn to opt for a second referendum before a general election, saying it would be both electorally damaging and fundamentally wrong to continue with the party\u2019s current Brexit policy.</p> <p>Khan, one of the party\u2019s most powerful office-holders, called on Labour to ballot its members on whether the party should immediately back remaining in the EU, branding the existing position a \u201cfudge\u201d that risked losing the next election.</p> <p>Speaking at his offices in City Hall, he said it was both \u201cthe wrong policy and also electorally bad\u201d for the party to go into an imminent general election without telling voters Labour is in favour of staying in the EU.</p> <p>\u201cI am not sure, bearing in mind how big Brexit is, that we can have a general election and argue on NHS, policing, schools, the environment with Brexit not being resolved and our position being so unclear; it\u2019s bad politics and the wrong place for us to be,\u201d he said.</p> <p>In a wide-ranging interview six months before Khan comes up for re-election as mayor, he said his decision to speak out was not related to any worries about his own prospects, arguing that he had always been clearly pro-remain. Instead, he claimed he felt obliged to warn the national party against making a huge mistake.</p> <p>His intervention comes at a time when Corbyn is under increasing pressure from senior shadow cabinet members to agree to a second referendum before an election, with many of them arguing it is crucial to first get Brexit sorted. The party is trailing in the polls, with the Lib Dems appearing to attract pro-remain voters with their position in favour of revoking Brexit, while Labour continues to refuse to say which way it would campaign in a second referendum.</p> <p>The mayor launched a fresh broadside at Labour\u2019s Brexit policy just three weeks after the party\u2019s autumn conference, at which delegates backed Corbyn\u2019s policy of fighting an election promising to negotiate a Labour-backed Brexit deal then putting that to a public vote.</p> <p>Khan said this position \u201cdoes not make sense\u201d as the party risked losing leave-backing voters to the Tories and Brexit party anyway, while seeing many remain voters go to the Lib Dems. But he also said it was wrong for Labour to be swayed by the argument that some of its heartlands are pro-Brexit, saying the party should take a lead in the same way it has tackled racism in society, championed the NHS and fought for women\u2019s rights.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0c058a0829ccec2f48ab5484c22b03f3a2b58571\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0c058a0829ccec2f48ab5484c22b03f3a2b58571/0_0_3941_5911/667.jpg\" alt=\"Sadiq Khan photographed at City Hall, 10 October 2019.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sadiq Khan photographed at City Hall, 10 October 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alicia Canter/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cCan you imagine in the early 20th century Keir Hardie being told this women\u2019s right to vote stuff is a bit tricksy on the doorstep in Doncaster and Wigan and I\u2019m not sure we should be doing this,\u201d he said. \u201cMy dad came to this country in the 1960s, and there were signs saying no blacks, no Irish, no dogs \u2026 Can you imagine if Labour leaders say: \u2018In Wolverhampton there\u2019s this poster that says: \u2018If you want an N for a neighbour, vote Labour\u2019, I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s electorally advantageous for us to run it past the Race Relations Act. Let\u2019s not do it.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Asked whether a second referendum should come before a general election, Khan said: \u201cAbsolutely. Let\u2019s resolve the issue of Brexit, give the British public a final say. Leave the EU on terms negotiated by the government or the option of remaining. Once that\u2019s been resolved, have a general election as soon as possible and we\u2019ve got such an exciting policy offer when it comes to the NHS, policing, schools, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/25/labour-green-new-deal\">Green New Deal</a>.\u201d</p> <p>Khan\u2019s position mirrors that of Tom Watson, the Labour deputy leader, and Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, also revealed on Thursday she had concerns about an election before Brexit was settled. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, and Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, are also understood to have raised concerns this week that stumbling into a quick general election could be a \u201ctrap\u201d for Labour.</p> <p>However, Corbyn has so far repeatedly made clear that he will vote for an election as soon as no-deal Brexit is off the table.</p> <p>Khan said he was not necessarily worried about Labour trailing in the polls right now as they \u201cgo up and down\u201d and the party gained ground during the campaign in 2017. But he said he was concerned about the scale of movement to the Lib Dems over Brexit at the European elections.</p> <p>He dismissed Corbyn\u2019s argument that the party should decide how to campaign only after Labour has negotiated its own Brexit deal, saying: \u201cThere is no Brexit that is better than remaining in the EU.\u201d</p> <p>Khan, who is up for re-election in May next year, said he had told Corbyn many times his own position and he believed there was further scope for the party to shift on its Brexit policy.</p> <p>As well as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/28/shaun-bailey-is-tory-candidate-for-mayor-of-london\">Tory candidate Shaun Bailey</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/14/legalise-cannabis-says-liberal-democrat-candidate-for-london-mayor\">Lib Dem Siobhan Benita</a>, Khan is facing the independent candidacy of the former Tory MP <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/04/rory-stewart-made-sadiq-khan-win-london-mayor-2020-less-certain\">Rory Stewart</a>. But he said he was also not concerned about the newcomer to the race, who has made a name for himself doing a series of walks throughout the country talking to voters.</p> <p>\u201cI walk all the time. What I don\u2019t do is walk around London with an iPhone filming my walk,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd what I don\u2019t do is treat Londoners like natives. We aren\u2019t natives. We are people who enjoy walking around our city, whether it\u2019s drinking in pubs, eating in cafes, eating in restaurants without being filmed. We don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything unique about that.\u201d</p> <p>He said he looked forward to debating with Stewart if he was still a candidate in six months\u2019 time.</p> <p>On climate emergency protesters <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/10/extinction-rebellion-protesters-arrested-at-london-city-airport\">Extinction Rebellion</a>, who are halfway through their promised two-week period of action in central London, he said he feared they risked losing public sympathy .</p> <p>\u201cAs somebody who is sympathetic to the cause, you\u2019re in danger of losing public opinion. There is a tipping point where your actions can lead to people rather than being sympathetic to having animosity towards you. That\u2019s why it\u2019s a real dilemma. That\u2019s why the way to win over public opinion and keep it is protest lawfully and peacefully.\u201d</p> <p>Asked if Extinction Rebellion had reached that tipping point, he said: \u201cI\u2019m not sure of the answer ... but as somebody sympathetic to the issue I do worry about public opinion not being won over but being lost.\u201d</p>",

The mayor launched a fresh broadside at Labour\u2019s Brexit policy just three weeks after the party\u2019s autumn conference, at which delegates backed Corbyn\u2019s policy of fighting an election promising to negotiate a Labour-backed Brexit deal then putting that to a public vote. Khan said this position \u201cdoes not make sense\u201d as the party risked losing leave-backing voters to the Tories and Brexit party anyway, while seeing many remain voters go to the Lib Dems. But he also said it was wrong for Labour to be swayed by the argument that some of its heartlands are pro-Brexit, saying the party should take a lead in the same way it has tackled racism in society, championed the NHS and fought for women\u2019s rights. \u201cCan you imagine in the early 20th century Keir Hardie being told this women\u2019s right to vote stuff is a bit tricksy on the doorstep in Doncaster and Wigan and I\u2019m not sure we should be doing this,\u201d he said. \u201cMy dad came to this country in the 1960s, and there were signs saying no blacks, no Irish, no dogs \u2026 Can you imagine if Labour leaders say: \u2018In Wolverhampton there\u2019s this poster that says: \u2018If you want an N for a neighbour, vote Labour\u2019, I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s electorally advantageous for us to run it past the Race Relations Act. Let\u2019s not do it.\u2019\u201d Asked whether a second referendum should come before a general election, Khan said: \u201cAbsolutely. Let\u2019s resolve the issue of Brexit, give the British public a final say. Leave the EU on terms negotiated by the government or the option of remaining. Once that\u2019s been resolved, have a general election as soon as possible and we\u2019ve got such an exciting policy offer when it comes to the NHS, policing, schools, a Green New Deal.\u201d Khan\u2019s position mirrors that of Tom Watson, the Labour deputy leader, and Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, also revealed on Thursday she had concerns about an election before Brexit was settled. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, and Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, are also understood to have raised concerns this week that stumbling into a quick general election could be a \u201ctrap\u201d for Labour. However, Corbyn has so far repeatedly made clear that he will vote for an election as soon as no-deal Brexit is off the table. Khan said he was not necessarily worried about Labour trailing in the polls right now as they \u201cgo up and down\u201d and the party gained ground during the campaign in 2017. But he said he was concerned about the scale of movement to the Lib Dems over Brexit at the European elections. He dismissed Corbyn\u2019s argument that the party should decide how to campaign only after Labour has negotiated its own Brexit deal, saying: \u201cThere is no Brexit that is better than remaining in the EU.\u201d Khan, who is up for re-election in May next year, said he had told Corbyn many times his own position and he believed there was further scope for the party to shift on its Brexit policy. As well as the Tory candidate Shaun Bailey and the Lib Dem Siobhan Benita, Khan is facing the independent candidacy of the former Tory MP Rory Stewart. But he said he was also not concerned about the newcomer to the race, who has made a name for himself doing a series of walks throughout the country talking to voters. \u201cI walk all the time. What I don\u2019t do is walk around London with an iPhone filming my walk,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd what I don\u2019t do is treat Londoners like natives. We aren\u2019t natives. We are people who enjoy walking around our city, whether it\u2019s drinking in pubs, eating in cafes, eating in restaurants without being filmed. We don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything unique about that.\u201d He said he looked forward to debating with Stewart if he was still a candidate in six months\u2019 time. On climate emergency protesters Extinction Rebellion, who are halfway through their promised two-week period of action in central London, he said he feared they risked losing public sympathy . \u201cAs somebody who is sympathetic to the cause, you\u2019re in danger of losing public opinion. There is a tipping point where your actions can lead to people rather than being sympathetic to having animosity towards you. That\u2019s why it\u2019s a real dilemma. That\u2019s why the way to win over public opinion and keep it is protest lawfully and peacefully.\u201d Asked if Extinction Rebellion had reached that tipping point, he said: \u201cI\u2019m not sure of the answer ... but as somebody sympathetic to the issue I do worry about public opinion not being won over but being lost.\u201d",

Democrats have suggested it is a more clearcut case than the special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report on Russian election interference, which found 10 potential instances of Trump seeking to obstruct justice.</p> <p>But Mark Mitchell, 58, argued that Trump did not intend to single out Biden and was rather concerned more generally about corruption involving Democrats, including during the 2016 election. \u201cI\u2019m lawyer and it\u2019s all jazzed up,\u201d he insisted. \u201cTrump may be a really bad bike ride but he doesn\u2019t have a mean streak.

There\u2019s nothing there.\u201d</p> <p>Closer to the 20,000-seat arena, Ben Kangar, a Liberian American and one of the few people of colour at the rally, expressed a similar sentiment.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The president hasn\u2019t done anything I would say is liable to impeachment.

I\u2019m not a fan of him as a person \u2013 he\u2019s a pig \u2013 but he doesn\u2019t sugar-coat anything. He says what he thinks and that\u2019s what I like.\u201d Crawford said the steel industry had been revived in her home, Granite City, Illinois, since Trump became president. But she allowed that the impeachment inquiry might have solid grounds. \u201cI hate to be the person who says I don\u2019t know what to believe, but I really don\u2019t,\u201d she admitted. \u201cIf he\u2019s impeached and that\u2019s the way it\u2019s going to go, that\u2019s what the country is founded on.\u201d Standing at the bar, Deena Eriksson, an estate agent, agreed: \u201cIf he did something wrong, he should be impeached. He should have handlers dealing with his tweeting and his bull-in-a-china-shop behaviour.\u201d Trump used his rally to hurl coarse insults at Biden (\u201cHe was only a good vice-president because he understood how to kiss Barack Obama\u2019s ass\u201d) and fling allegations about Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, enriching himself in Ukraine. The claims of wrongdoing have no factual basis but echo in conservative media and appear to be penetrating, at least on Planet Trump. Without citing evidence, Eriksson said: \u201cBiden\u2019s son is in the pocket of Ukraine. If someone has been eating cookies and there\u2019s chocolate around my mouth, it\u2019s probably me. If there\u2019s chocolate around someone\u2019s mouth here, it\u2019s probablyJoe Biden.\u201d \u2018It\u2019s all political games\u2019 Some loyalists are in denial about the content of Trump\u2019s July call with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, despite the White House having released a rough transcript that shows the US president brought up Biden. Democrats have suggested it is a more clearcut case than the special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report on Russian election interference, which found 10 potential instances of Trump seeking to obstruct justice. But Mark Mitchell, 58, argued that Trump did not intend to single out Biden and was rather concerned more generally about corruption involving Democrats, including during the 2016 election. \u201cI\u2019m lawyer and it\u2019s all jazzed up,\u201d he insisted. \u201cTrump may be a really bad bike ride but he doesn\u2019t have a mean streak. If he did, he wouldn\u2019t have put out the transcript. \u201cThe Democrats are playing political games. They\u2019re trying to focus on the distillation of the call to make it seem he has a hardened heart but I don\u2019t think he has that sophistication. He was asking if there\u2019s corruption there and saying we need to root it out. There\u2019s nothing there.\u201d Closer to the 20,000-seat arena, Ben Kangar, a Liberian American and one of the few people of colour at the rally, expressed a similar sentiment. \u201cI don\u2019t think he was wrong,\u201d the 56-year-old said. \u201cHe has the right as the president ask if anyone from his country is doing something wrong. It is a matter of integrity. The things were done before Biden got in the race. Biden did what the president is accused of.\u201d Kangar, a leadership trainer, added: \u201cThe president hasn\u2019t done anything I would say is liable to impeachment. It\u2019s all political games.\u201d Rolf Lalone, 60, a nuclear plant engineer, dismissed impeachment as \u201ca political show\u201d and backed Trump\u2019s judgment on Syria. \u201cI\u2019m always one to say we need to pull back,\u201d he said. \u201cIf there are humanitarian issues, it needs to be the world coming together. Obama said lead from behind. I like that.\u201d Such responses suggest that while Trump\u2019s move in Syria provoked a rare rebellion from Republicans in Congress, his instincts may still be closely aligned with those of his supporters. After he told a rambling but emotive story about receiving the coffins of America\u2019s war dead, the rally erupted in chants of \u201cBring them home!\u201d Impeachment remains the biggest crisis of his presidency. While the House seems likely to enforce it, Trump will presumably be acquitted by the Republican Senate unless public opinion turns. This week, a Fox News poll asked \u201cShould the president be impeached and removed from office?\u201d Fifty-one per cent said yes and 43% said no. Nothing, however, lubricates his cult of personality as much as his knack for turning liberals and the media into pantomime villains. It is his final firewall against impeachment. Joe Kaneble, 65, an office clerk, said: \u201cHe was our last-ditch effort to save America from socialist Democrats and the Hillary Clinton establishment. It was like the revolutionary war, as far as I\u2019m concerned.\u201d Clinton beat Trump by 3m ballots in the popular vote but lost in the electoral college. So who did Kaneble think will win the battle of 2020? \u201cAnother landslide,\u201d he said.",

      "body": "<p>I thought our faulty burglar alarm \u2013 which sets itself off for no reason at random intervals \u2013 would break me, and it did: I now rise wordlessly from bed to turn it off, as pliant as a zombie. Some nights the youngest one gets there first. In the silence that follows the sharp chirp of deactivation, I can hear him trudging back up the stairs, while I\u2019m still trying to find my glasses in the dark.</p> <p>\u201c4.30am,\u201d I say, looking at my phone.</p> <p>\u201cI called them again,\u201d my wife says. \u201cThey haven\u2019t got back to me.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, the burglar alarm has become just another noise to adapt to, like the smoke alarm that lets the whole house know someone is making toast. The possibility of fire no longer occurs to me.</p> <p>On Friday afternoon, my wife pulls open the door of my office shed.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re coming on Tuesday,\u201d she says. \u201cAre you in, in case I\u2019m out?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe alarm people?\u201d I say.</p> <p>\u201cNo, the oven people,\u201d she says. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard from the alarm people.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOven people?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve ordered a new oven,\u201d she says.</p> <p>I blame myself. During a recent conversation with an oven repairman, I asked about ovens that didn\u2019t break all the time or require the constant replacement of expensive spare parts. He recommended a model of catering oven, and I became taken with the idea of owning something utilitarian and sturdy, an appliance that would lend my kitchen the businesslike air of commercial premises. Then I found out catering ovens cost \u00a33,000.</p> <p>That put an end to the matter as far as I was concerned, but my wife quietly opened a separate line of inquiry into reliable domestic ovens.</p> <p>\u201cTuesday,\u201d she says.</p> <p>On Saturday, my wife stops me on my way up the stairs.</p> <p>\u201cAre you here on Thursday for the alarm man?\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m here on any day for the alarm man,\u201d I say.</p> <p>\u201cI just think we might need a lesson in how it works,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cHe can come at four in the morning, if he wants,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m up anyway.\u201d</p> <p>On Tuesday afternoon my wife asks me to step into the kitchen. There are two men standing there, hands in pockets, with the old oven halfway out of its slot.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re saying they won\u2019t install it,\u201d my wife says. \u201cBecause the worktop is wood.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the worktop, it\u2019s the splashback,\u201d says one of the men, referring to what I believe is more accurately known as the upstand: a three-inch wooden skirt running where the worktop meets the wall.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s regulations,\u201d the other man says. \u201cFor fire.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d I say.</p> <p>\u201cFix it,\u201d my wife says.</p> <p>\u201cWhat, in front of everyone?\u201d I say.</p> <p>\u201cYes!\u201d she says. \u201cBefore they take the oven away!\u201d</p> <p>The upstand behind the oven is glued to the wall, and comes away with a crack after I attack it with a hammer and chisel. But the adjacent sections are screwed to the worktop, and cannot be worked loose.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/sep/21/tim-dowling-how-long-does-it-take-to-be-broken-by-early-morning-alarm\">Tim Dowling: how long does it take to be broken by a 4.50am alarm?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cHow much of it has to go?\u201d I say.</p> <p>\u201c70 mil, either side,\u201d says the man.</p> <p>\u201cCan\u2019t you just saw off two chunks?\u201d my wife says.</p> <p>\u201cWon\u2019t that look weird?\u201d I say.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cYou will care,\u201d I say. \u201cAnyway, I don\u2019t have the right saw.\u201d</p> <p>Only after the men leave do I have a bright idea: removing the worktop altogether by unscrewing it from beneath.

      "bodyText": "I thought our faulty burglar alarm \u2013 which sets itself off for no reason at random intervals \u2013 would break me, and it did: I now rise wordlessly from bed to turn it off, as pliant as a zombie. Some nights the youngest one gets there first. In the silence that follows the sharp chirp of deactivation, I can hear him trudging back up the stairs, while I\u2019m still trying to find my glasses in the dark. \u201c4.30am,\u201d I say, looking at my phone. \u201cI called them again,\u201d my wife says. \u201cThey haven\u2019t got back to me.\u201d Meanwhile, the burglar alarm has become just another noise to adapt to, like the smoke alarm that lets the whole house know someone is making toast. The possibility of fire no longer occurs to me. On Friday afternoon, my wife pulls open the door of my office shed. \u201cThey\u2019re coming on Tuesday,\u201d she says. \u201cAre you in, in case I\u2019m out?\u201d \u201cThe alarm people?\u201d I say. \u201cNo, the oven people,\u201d she says. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard from the alarm people.\u201d \u201cOven people?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve ordered a new oven,\u201d she says. I blame myself. During a recent conversation with an oven repairman, I asked about ovens that didn\u2019t break all the time or require the constant replacement of expensive spare parts. He recommended a model of catering oven, and I became taken with the idea of owning something utilitarian and sturdy, an appliance that would lend my kitchen the businesslike air of commercial premises. Then I found out catering ovens cost \u00a33,000. That put an end to the matter as far as I was concerned, but my wife quietly opened a separate line of inquiry into reliable domestic ovens. \u201cTuesday,\u201d she says. On Saturday, my wife stops me on my way up the stairs. \u201cAre you here on Thursday for the alarm man?\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m here on any day for the alarm man,\u201d I say. \u201cI just think we might need a lesson in how it works,\u201d she says. \u201cHe can come at four in the morning, if he wants,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m up anyway.\u201d On Tuesday afternoon my wife asks me to step into the kitchen. There are two men standing there, hands in pockets, with the old oven halfway out of its slot. \u201cThey\u2019re saying they won\u2019t install it,\u201d my wife says. \u201cBecause the worktop is wood.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not the worktop, it\u2019s the splashback,\u201d says one of the men, referring to what I believe is more accurately known as the upstand: a three-inch wooden skirt running where the worktop meets the wall. \u201cIt\u2019s regulations,\u201d the other man says. \u201cFor fire.\u201d \u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d I say. \u201cFix it,\u201d my wife says. \u201cWhat, in front of everyone?\u201d I say. \u201cYes!\u201d she says. \u201cBefore they take the oven away!\u201d The upstand behind the oven is glued to the wall, and comes away with a crack after I attack it with a hammer and chisel. But the adjacent sections are screwed to the worktop, and cannot be worked loose. \u201cHow much of it has to go?\u201d I say. \u201c70 mil, either side,\u201d says the man. \u201cCan\u2019t you just saw off two chunks?\u201d my wife says. \u201cWon\u2019t that look weird?\u201d I say. \u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d she says. \u201cYou will care,\u201d I say. \u201cAnyway, I don\u2019t have the right saw.\u201d Only after the men leave do I have a bright idea: removing the worktop altogether by unscrewing it from beneath. It takes five minutes. \u201cToo bad I didn\u2019t think of this sooner,\u201d I say. \u201cThey can\u2019t redeliver until Saturday,\u201d my wife says. The smoke alarm goes off. \u201cWho\u2019s having toast?\u201d I say. \u201cI am,\u201d says the youngest one, appearing. \u201cWhy are you having toast now?\u201d I say. \u201cBecause I\u2019m hungry,\u201d he says. \u201cWhy are you taking the kitchen apart?\u201d On Thursday, the alarm man arrives and replaces a spent battery, solving the problem. Then he demonstrates how to engage the alarm in a way that stops the cat setting it off. \u201cFour-digit code,\u201d he says, pointing to the box. \u201cThen C for cat, then yes.\u201d \u201cCode, C for cat, yes,\u201d I repeat solemnly.

      "body": "<p>Once upon a time in Redhill, Surrey, Sophie and Joe asked Jenny and Mark to be godparents to their baby daughter. It made perfect sense to Mark. Joe had been his best man. They went way back. But Jenny wasn\u2019t so sure.</p> <p>\u201cI said no, because I\u2019m not a Christian,\u201d she recalls. \u201cThey said it was fine, as they aren\u2019t Christian, either, and they weren\u2019t going to bother with the church bit. I still said no \u2013 I didn\u2019t understand what the job I was signing up to actually was. They said it was nothing, just \u2018being around\u2019. I said no, because I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a thing.\u201d</p> <p>When they turned up to the non-christening-christening party, Jenny was furious to discover that their presence had been taken as full acquiescence to godparenthood. \u201cMy husband just mumbled that it was OK and bundled me out,\u201d she fumes. \u201cIt\u2019s so odd. I don\u2019t understand why non-religious people would do this.\u201d</p> <p>Jenny\u2019s irritation may be unusual, but her feeling that \u201cthe godparent thing\u201d is outdated is not. The tradition of naming one or more non-parental figures as spiritual mentors or guardians comes from the Christian baptism ceremony; there is no equivalent role in Judaism, Islam or Hinduism, as there is no baptism to bear witness to.</p> <p>But there aren\u2019t many Christian baptisms to bear witness to any more. The Church of England baptised only 10% of babies in England and Wales in 2017; in London, it was fewer than 5%. That compares with 75% in 1933 and 21% as recently as 1999. Catholic baptisms have also declined.</p> <p>Dr Lois Lee, a sociologist at the University of Kent who co-led <a href=\"https://research.kent.ac.uk/understandingunbelief/\" title=\"\">Understanding Unbelief</a>, a major research project into non-religion, considers it a significant shift. \u201cMany people are worried about the decline of rite-of-passage rituals with the rise of non-religion. Baptisms and equivalents are one rite that has declined. Formal non-religious alternatives really haven\u2019t emerged.\u201d</p> <p>There has been little academic research into birth rituals, she says \u2013 in contrast with \u201cdeath studies\u201d, which is a fashionable (and male-dominated) discipline. \u201cWhy do we think death is so much more significant than birth and new life?\u201d Lee says. \u201cEveryone I know who has had a baby has found it pretty existentially significant. And origin stories are as crucial to religions as their accounts of the afterlife. So the lack of research is in itself interesting.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Our son has five \u2018godparents\u2019. Why? I\u00a0liked the idea they'd provide a different influence at\u00a0different times in his life</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Despite the decline in baptism, many parents are still naming godparents (often with inverted commas), or creating new roles such as guideparents, oddparents, squadparents or guardians. Like Christmas, it appears to be something that nonbelievers are not prepared to renounce entirely. </p> <p>Still, the ambiguity around the role can lead to misunderstanding, awkwardness and resentment, depending on who is asking whom to be whose godparent. The rich godparent may suspect she is being shaken down for birthday presents; the gay godparent may feel he is being offered a consolation prize for assumed singledom.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a passive-aggressive way of locking you into a disintegrating friendship for life,\u201d complains one multiple godfather, who wishes he had said no to a particular friend. \u201cInstead, I just agreed and became the worst godparent ever. It was annoying, not least because they asked six other people first.\u201d </p> <p>Another friend describes her godmother as \u201camazing\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m an only child. My parents are wonderful, but hard work. It\u2019s great to know someone who\u2019s got perspective from the past, but also has your back. As someone from a small family, it makes a huge difference.\u201d A common-or-garden friend might play that role, of course. \u201cBut this just gently formalises it,\u201d she says.</p> <p>So, what is a secular godparent supposed to do? Judging by celebrity godparents, that is open to interpretation. A godparent might be a paraspiritual big-sister figure, as one imagines Drew Barrymore is to her goddaughter, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/apr/09/frances-bean-cobain-i-dont-really-like-nirvana-that-much\" title=\"\">Frances Bean Cobain</a>, the daughter of Kurt Cobain and Courtney Love. Alternatively, they might be an avuncular Xbox companion, as perhaps Simon Pegg is for his goddaughter, Apple Martin, the daughter of Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin.</p> <p>Certainly, the secondary role of the godparent \u2013 guarantor of good standing within the community/provider of Oscars plus-ones \u2013 has risen to the fore in these cynical times. But if you are the sort of person who is prepared to use your child as collateral in a grand social-advancement putsch, do it subtly, please. At a newspaper where I used to work, it was rumoured that a prominent columnist had asked a then prominent politician to be godparent to their child. The politician refused, apparently.</p> <p>While secular equivalents to baptisms are not mainstream, they are growing in popularity. Humanists UK, which represents \u201cpeople who seek to live good lives without religious or superstitious beliefs\u201d, reports a <a href=\"https://www.expatwoman.com/ewmums/en/babies/baby-features/4-great-ways-welcome-baby-world\" title=\"\">60% </a><a href=\"https://www.expatwoman.com/ewmums/en/babies/baby-features/4-great-ways-welcome-baby-world\" title=\"\">increase in the number of </a><a href=\"https://www.expatwoman.com/ewmums/en/babies/baby-features/4-great-ways-welcome-baby-world\" title=\"\">naming</a><a href=\"https://www.expatwoman.com/ewmums/en/babies/baby-features/4-great-ways-welcome-baby-world\" title=\"\"> ceremonies</a> in the past five years. \u201cOur experience is that almost all humanist naming ceremonies have guideparents involved,\u201d says Casey-Ann Seaniger, a spokesperson for the group. \u201cA trend we have noticed is for friends rather than relatives to be chosen.\u201d In Understanding Unbelief, \u201cfamily\u201d emerged as the number-one source of meaning for religious and non-religious people alike, with \u201cfriends\u201d not far behind; in some ways, the guideparent bridges the two. Often, the ceremonies involve a symbolic act: planting a tree, say, or making handprints together.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Jake described himself as not relating to any religion \u2013 the atmosphere in the church was tense after that</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Caroline Lambie has overseen more than 50 humanist naming ceremonies in the past 10 years. Most people choose four or five guideparents, she says, often for specific reasons. \u201cOne might be chosen as a cultural guide. Another might be a really good cook, say. They usually make pledges that are specific to the child. I am asked to say things like: \u2018Do you promise to help the child grow as a person? To teach her how to do new things? To be there if she needs a laugh or a shoulder to cry on? To help her to reach her potential?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>My wife and I freestyled our own naming day after our son was born, five years ago. The fact that not one of our friends has done the same since suggests that our selection of poems and finger food didn\u2019t hit the mark, but I am glad that we did it. It felt important to do something. </p> <p>There wasn\u2019t much to serve as a template, so we had to think carefully about what we wanted to say and why we were choosing each of his five \u201cgodparents\u201d. I worried that five was excessive, but I liked the idea of his godparents providing different influences at different points in his life. </p> <p>While the secular interpretation of godparent is a bit of a free-for-all, the Christian interpretation is not. To be a godparent to a Catholic child, you have to be a baptised, practising Catholic (although a baptised person from another denomination can serve as an \u201cofficial witness\u201d). To be a godparent to an Anglican child, you need only to have been baptised.</p> <p>Some vicars are more easygoing about this than others, as Simon discovered when he asked his friend Jake to be godfather to his daughter. \u201cOur very liberal, gay vicar stopped the service to ask about the religious descent of the godfather,\u201d he recalls. \u201cJake described himself as not relating to any religion \u2013 and for a while it looked as if the service wasn\u2019t going to continue.\u201d Eventually, after a \u201cpretty heated\u201d argument, a compromise was struck: \u201cMy daughter would be christened, but the godfather would remain in the pews and not approach the font. The atmosphere in the church, as you can imagine, was tense after that. Since the vicar lives close to us, it has been a bit awkward subsequently.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/mar/08/he-chose-me-to-be-his-godmother\">He chose me to be his godmother</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is always a good idea to talk these things through before you get to the font. On the other hand, misunderstandings make good bonding experiences.

      "bodyText": "Once upon a time in Redhill, Surrey, Sophie and Joe asked Jenny and Mark to be godparents to their baby daughter. It made perfect sense to Mark. Joe had been his best man. They went way back. But Jenny wasn\u2019t so sure. \u201cI said no, because I\u2019m not a Christian,\u201d she recalls. \u201cThey said it was fine, as they aren\u2019t Christian, either, and they weren\u2019t going to bother with the church bit. I still said no \u2013 I didn\u2019t understand what the job I was signing up to actually was. They said it was nothing, just \u2018being around\u2019. I said no, because I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a thing.\u201d When they turned up to the non-christening-christening party, Jenny was furious to discover that their presence had been taken as full acquiescence to godparenthood. \u201cMy husband just mumbled that it was OK and bundled me out,\u201d she fumes. \u201cIt\u2019s so odd. I don\u2019t understand why non-religious people would do this.\u201d Jenny\u2019s irritation may be unusual, but her feeling that \u201cthe godparent thing\u201d is outdated is not. The tradition of naming one or more non-parental figures as spiritual mentors or guardians comes from the Christian baptism ceremony; there is no equivalent role in Judaism, Islam or Hinduism, as there is no baptism to bear witness to. But there aren\u2019t many Christian baptisms to bear witness to any more. The Church of England baptised only 10% of babies in England and Wales in 2017; in London, it was fewer than 5%. That compares with 75% in 1933 and 21% as recently as 1999. Catholic baptisms have also declined. Dr Lois Lee, a sociologist at the University of Kent who co-led Understanding Unbelief, a major research project into non-religion, considers it a significant shift. \u201cMany people are worried about the decline of rite-of-passage rituals with the rise of non-religion. Baptisms and equivalents are one rite that has declined. Formal non-religious alternatives really haven\u2019t emerged.\u201d There has been little academic research into birth rituals, she says \u2013 in contrast with \u201cdeath studies\u201d, which is a fashionable (and male-dominated) discipline. \u201cWhy do we think death is so much more significant than birth and new life?\u201d Lee says. \u201cEveryone I know who has had a baby has found it pretty existentially significant. And origin stories are as crucial to religions as their accounts of the afterlife. So the lack of research is in itself interesting.\u201d Despite the decline in baptism, many parents are still naming godparents (often with inverted commas), or creating new roles such as guideparents, oddparents, squadparents or guardians. Like Christmas, it appears to be something that nonbelievers are not prepared to renounce entirely. Still, the ambiguity around the role can lead to misunderstanding, awkwardness and resentment, depending on who is asking whom to be whose godparent. The rich godparent may suspect she is being shaken down for birthday presents; the gay godparent may feel he is being offered a consolation prize for assumed singledom. \u201cIt\u2019s a passive-aggressive way of locking you into a disintegrating friendship for life,\u201d complains one multiple godfather, who wishes he had said no to a particular friend. \u201cInstead, I just agreed and became the worst godparent ever. It was annoying, not least because they asked six other people first.\u201d Another friend describes her godmother as \u201camazing\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m an only child. My parents are wonderful, but hard work. It\u2019s great to know someone who\u2019s got perspective from the past, but also has your back. As someone from a small family, it makes a huge difference.\u201d A common-or-garden friend might play that role, of course. \u201cBut this just gently formalises it,\u201d she says. So, what is a secular godparent supposed to do? Judging by celebrity godparents, that is open to interpretation. A godparent might be a paraspiritual big-sister figure, as one imagines Drew Barrymore is to her goddaughter, Frances Bean Cobain, the daughter of Kurt Cobain and Courtney Love. Alternatively, they might be an avuncular Xbox companion, as perhaps Simon Pegg is for his goddaughter, Apple Martin, the daughter of Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin. Certainly, the secondary role of the godparent \u2013 guarantor of good standing within the community/provider of Oscars plus-ones \u2013 has risen to the fore in these cynical times. But if you are the sort of person who is prepared to use your child as collateral in a grand social-advancement putsch, do it subtly, please. At a newspaper where I used to work, it was rumoured that a prominent columnist had asked a then prominent politician to be godparent to their child. The politician refused, apparently. While secular equivalents to baptisms are not mainstream, they are growing in popularity. Humanists UK, which represents \u201cpeople who seek to live good lives without religious or superstitious beliefs\u201d, reports a 60% increase in the number of naming ceremonies in the past five years. \u201cOur experience is that almost all humanist naming ceremonies have guideparents involved,\u201d says Casey-Ann Seaniger, a spokesperson for the group. \u201cA trend we have noticed is for friends rather than relatives to be chosen.\u201d In Understanding Unbelief, \u201cfamily\u201d emerged as the number-one source of meaning for religious and non-religious people alike, with \u201cfriends\u201d not far behind; in some ways, the guideparent bridges the two. Often, the ceremonies involve a symbolic act: planting a tree, say, or making handprints together. Caroline Lambie has overseen more than 50 humanist naming ceremonies in the past 10 years. Most people choose four or five guideparents, she says, often for specific reasons. \u201cOne might be chosen as a cultural guide. Another might be a really good cook, say. They usually make pledges that are specific to the child. I am asked to say things like: \u2018Do you promise to help the child grow as a person? To teach her how to do new things? To be there if she needs a laugh or a shoulder to cry on? To help her to reach her potential?\u2019\u201d My wife and I freestyled our own naming day after our son was born, five years ago. The fact that not one of our friends has done the same since suggests that our selection of poems and finger food didn\u2019t hit the mark, but I am glad that we did it. It felt important to do something. There wasn\u2019t much to serve as a template, so we had to think carefully about what we wanted to say and why we were choosing each of his five \u201cgodparents\u201d. I worried that five was excessive, but I liked the idea of his godparents providing different influences at different points in his life. While the secular interpretation of godparent is a bit of a free-for-all, the Christian interpretation is not. To be a godparent to a Catholic child, you have to be a baptised, practising Catholic (although a baptised person from another denomination can serve as an \u201cofficial witness\u201d). To be a godparent to an Anglican child, you need only to have been baptised. Some vicars are more easygoing about this than others, as Simon discovered when he asked his friend Jake to be godfather to his daughter. \u201cOur very liberal, gay vicar stopped the service to ask about the religious descent of the godfather,\u201d he recalls. \u201cJake described himself as not relating to any religion \u2013 and for a while it looked as if the service wasn\u2019t going to continue.\u201d Eventually, after a \u201cpretty heated\u201d argument, a compromise was struck: \u201cMy daughter would be christened, but the godfather would remain in the pews and not approach the font. The atmosphere in the church, as you can imagine, was tense after that. Since the vicar lives close to us, it has been a bit awkward subsequently.\u201d It is always a good idea to talk these things through before you get to the font. On the other hand, misunderstandings make good bonding experiences. Simon is now \u201cguideparent\u201d to Jake\u2019s child, with no religious veneer besides \u201cgenerous gifting\u201d at Christmas. But among all of the new approaches and outside-the-box thinking, one side of the equation hasn\u2019t had much of a look-in: the children themselves. Nina, an editor from London, has had a lot of experience of being a godparent, but when it came to her turn to choose for her own children, she came up with an elegant solution. \u201cIn my early 30s, my friends started having kids and I found out I had fertility problems,\u201d she says. \u201cMaybe as an act of kindness, or because I was a handy extra pair of hands, my husband, Eddie, and I were asked over and over again to be godparents. I\u2019ve got eight or nine.\u201d When she and her husband finally adopted children \u2013 aged seven and 10 \u2013 they flipped things around: \u201cWe allowed them to choose their own godparents. It meant such a lot, as these people had been significant to them throughout the period of them settling into their new lives.\u201d \u2022 If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication).",

But friends say Lansman willingly became the fall guy, to shield Corbyn from direct responsibility.</p> <p>The Guardian understands that while Corbyn had been infuriated by Watson\u2019s speech calling for Labour to become an out-and-out remain party, and his allies had discussed ways of isolating Watson, the Labour leader had specifically asked for no action to be taken before conference.</p> <p>Murphy, his tough-minded enforcer, pressed ahead, reportedly telling colleagues it was too late to back out. Afterwards, according to two people present, the mild-mannered Corbyn fumed that the chaos made Labour look like \u201cfucking student politicians\u201d. He was forced to step in publicly and defend Watson.</p> <p>And as he and Watson sat alongside each other on the front bench in Westminster later that week, the deputy leader also showed Corbyn a screenshot of flyers handed out in Brighton calling on delegates to disrupt his speech \u2013 which he believed had the imprimatur of the leader\u2019s office.</p> <p>Ironically, the putsch had the reverse effect to that intended by the plotters, and gave Watson a new lease of life.</p> <p>He had seemed to colleagues to be increasingly detached in recent weeks, causing some to speculate that he could follow his friend Luciana Berger to the Lib Dems, perhaps taking 20 or so colleagues with him.

      "bodyText": "Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s advisers joke that their private strapline for the looming general election is: \u201cDowning Street or the dole.\u201d Everyone at the top of the Labour party is gearing up for a gruelling campaign \u2013 but they\u2019re also starting to imagine life afterwards. When one of Corbyn\u2019s key lieutenants, Karie Murphy, was quietly shifted aside last week, the official line was that she was keeping her title of chief of staff, and would move to Labour\u2019s HQ in Victoria to oversee the party\u2019s election campaign. But her departure was the most public signal yet of deep disquiet at the very top of the party about whether Labour is ready for government \u2013 or if Corbyn loses another general election, what might come next. Corbyn\u2019s close allies John McDonnell and Diane Abbott have been pressuring him to move Murphy for months, citing unhappiness among the 30-plus staff in his office, and the concern she was one of those acting as a brake on Labour\u2019s shift towards supporting a second referendum. Charismatic and tough, Murphy often held the combative conversations Corbyn tends to avoid, but McDonnell and others came to believe she was taking too many decisions on her boss\u2019s behalf. As one ally said: \u201cKarie had lapsed into thinking she ran Jeremy. Thankfully that era is over.\u201d The catalyst for sidelining her was the botched attempt to abolish Tom Watson\u2019s post of deputy leader, on the eve of the Labour conference. The move was blamed at the time on the Momentum chair, Jon Lansman, who tabled the motion at the national executive committee (NEC). But friends say Lansman willingly became the fall guy, to shield Corbyn from direct responsibility. The Guardian understands that while Corbyn had been infuriated by Watson\u2019s speech calling for Labour to become an out-and-out remain party, and his allies had discussed ways of isolating Watson, the Labour leader had specifically asked for no action to be taken before conference. Murphy, his tough-minded enforcer, pressed ahead, reportedly telling colleagues it was too late to back out. Afterwards, according to two people present, the mild-mannered Corbyn fumed that the chaos made Labour look like \u201cfucking student politicians\u201d. He was forced to step in publicly and defend Watson. And as he and Watson sat alongside each other on the front bench in Westminster later that week, the deputy leader also showed Corbyn a screenshot of flyers handed out in Brighton calling on delegates to disrupt his speech \u2013 which he believed had the imprimatur of the leader\u2019s office. Ironically, the putsch had the reverse effect to that intended by the plotters, and gave Watson a new lease of life. He had seemed to colleagues to be increasingly detached in recent weeks, causing some to speculate that he could follow his friend Luciana Berger to the Lib Dems, perhaps taking 20 or so colleagues with him. Instead, he arrived in Brighton emboldened and invigorated. The other factor in Murphy\u2019s departure was the resignation of Andrew Fisher, who lashed out against the leader of the opposition\u2019s office (Loto) in a furious parting email. Extracts were leaked to the Sunday Times. But after news of the shakeup in Loto emerged on Tuesday, the hyper-partisan website Skwawkbox \u2013 widely regarded in Labour circles as Murphy\u2019s mouthpiece \u2013 published the entire note. The picture it painted was less of ruthless ideological shock troops, more of chaos, division and simmering discontent. The revered elections expert David Butler said last week that he had \u201cnever felt more confused and uncertain\u201d about the outcome of the coming election. Corbyn loyalists hope that as in 2017, Labour will be able to reframe the campaign, away from Johnson\u2019s \u201cGet Brexit Done\u201d message, and return to the domestic agenda that worked so well for it in 2017 \u2013 though that may be much less effective when the Tories are talking incessantly about funding schools, hospitals and police officers. If Johnson returns with the solid majority he craves, however, McDonnell has conceded that he and Corbyn would have to step aside. And with Brexit cutting across the party\u2019s traditional left-right divide, it is very unclear whether they would be followed by a candidate who shares their political perspective. \u201cIt will be chaos,\u201d says one leftwing MP. Corbyn\u2019s victory over Brexit policy on the conference floor in Brighton underlined the intense loyalty he still commands from Labour members. \u201cThis is Jeremy\u2019s party!\u201d said one jubilant shadow minister at the time. But his longtime allies are also well aware that none of their favoured successors \u2013 Rebecca Long-Bailey, Laura Pidcock \u2013 are likely to inspire the same devotion. Internal polling earlier this year suggested Keir Starmer and Emily Thornberry were the most favoured successors among members, with Watson some distance behind, according to insiders. Earlier in the year, Starmer was rumoured to have struck up what colleagues jokingly called a \u201cbromance\u201d with McDonnell. It would have seen McDonnell dominate economic policy, while Starmer led the party, a 21st-century version of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown\u2019s Granita pact.

Earlier this year, utilities <a href=\"https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article229556149.html\">asked</a> the state for an even bigger payday. Meanwhile, PG&amp;E invested millions in state <a href=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/politics/article/PG-E-lobbying-spending-in-California-soars-after-13575166.php\">lobbying</a>, paid out $4.5bn in profits to shareholders over the last five years, and millions in executive bonuses \u2013 all while <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/pg-e-knew-for-years-its-lines-could-spark-wildfires-and-didnt-fix-them-11562768885\">deferring</a> necessary maintenance and repairs to its system.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of money went to dividends that should\u2019ve gone to your trees,\u201d a federal judge <a href=\"https://www.kqed.org/news/11737336/judge-pge-paid-out-stock-dividends-instead-of-trimming-trees\">told the company</a> in April.</p> <p>PG&amp;E equipment has been blamed for sparking 17 out of 23 major fires across the state in 2017, and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/nov/09/california-wildfire-paradise-chico-camp-fire\">2018 Camp </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/nov/09/california-wildfire-paradise-chico-camp-fire\">fire</a> that all but destroyed the town of Paradise and killed 85 people. Following those two devastating fire seasons, PG&amp;E filed for bankruptcy protection to cover its liability costs, which are expected to total upwards of $30bn, compared with the company\u2019s market cap of $20bn.

There\u2019s lots of executive branch authority over this situation,\u201d said Leah Stokes, utilities researcher and political science professor at UC Santa Barbara. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a blunt instrument to use on the problem.\u201d</p> <p>After this week, there are many open questions as to how PG&amp;E considers the problem and assesses fire risk.</p> <p>\u201cThe forecast didn\u2019t call for unprecedented extreme fire weather conditions. The power shutoff was unprecedented, but the weather conditions were not,\u201d said Daniel Swain, climate scientist at UCLA\u2019s Institute of the Environment and Sustainability. \u201cIt isn\u2019t entirely clear what did go into that decision. We don\u2019t know publicly what PG&amp;E\u2019s thresholds are.\u201d</p> <p>State rules leave utilities to control when they will shut down the power, and how they will choose to do it. PG&amp;E\u2019s de-energizing plan calls for the consideration of a variety of criteria and conditions when it comes to initiating a public safety power shutoff. According to the plan, \u201cNo single factor drives a Public Safety Power Shutoff.\u201d</p> <p>Some factors include: a national weather service \u201cred flag warning\u201d of high fire weather, low humidity levels, forecasted sustained winds, the availability of dry vegetation or fuels, and \u201con-the-ground, real-time observations from PG&amp;E crews\u201d. But there are no hard rules or numbers by which PG&amp;E abides when deciding whether or not to subjectively shut off the grid to millions of people in California.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"01e97e96c621b1968024378403f09a72cac9ec7f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/01e97e96c621b1968024378403f09a72cac9ec7f/0_0_3600_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"PG&amp;E\u2019s de-energizing plan calls for a consideration of a variety of criteria and conditions.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">PG&amp;E\u2019s de-energizing plan calls for a consideration of a variety of criteria and conditions.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff Chiu/Associated Press</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>California could easily meet those vague criteria a few times a year, said Swain.</p> <p>\u201cIf this is the risk aversion strategy that a private utility is going to take but we\u2019re going to be hitting those thresholds an awful lot in the present climate and might hit it even more frequently in a warmer future climate, that doesn\u2019t seem to be a very realistic long-term solution,\u201d said Swain. \u201cThe notion of doing this for anything short of a real emergency puts a huge burden on a lot of people.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Regulatory and ownership solutions</strong></h2> <p>And even as a business decision, for PG&amp;E, it\u2019s an inherently shortsighted one. \u201cYou\u2019re losing a lot of money by putting people out of power versus if you were undergrounding lines, or made microgrids, or solar and battery backup,\u201d said Stokes. \u201cYou could make those investments once and then have benefits in the future. Now you just have the costs without those investments.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s this kind of management that\u2019s inspired a campaign to take the electricity grid into public ownership.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a fundamental contradiction between PG&amp;E\u2019s mandate to make as much profit as they can for their shareholders and invest in the health and safety of Californians,\u201d said Keith Brower Brown, co-chair of the East Bay chapter of Democratic Socialists of America, which launched a <a href=\"https://letsownpge.org/\">campaign</a> for the public takeover of PG&amp;E in 2018. \u201cWe\u2019re not naive to the fact that there have been public utilities that have had problems too \u2013 just because something\u2019s public doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s run well. But there\u2019s a path to accountability when you have public control.\u201d</p> <p>But more control and regulation alone won\u2019t necessarily fix PG&amp;E\u2019s management, nor the grid itself.</p> <p>\u201cThe only way out of this bind is not only public ownership of the company but a massive scale public investment in building the kind of safe, clean energy infrastructure that we need,\u201d said Brown.</p> <p>As it stands, those investments and priorities are controlled and directed by a profit-motivated PG&amp;E. Newsom, the California governor,<strong> </strong>warned that changes to PG&amp;E will come slowly \u2013 the company operates more than 125,000 transmission and distribution power lines across roughly 70,000 square miles of the state. PG&amp;E previously put the cost of inspecting and repairing every bit of its grid at $150bn.</p> <p>So the public is left to bear the costs and risks in the meantime of a new kind of disaster, along with the familiar ones.</p> <p>\u201cNobody is investing for climate resilience at the level that\u2019s necessary and that\u2019s really what\u2019s concerning about this incident \u2013 this is one of the richest areas of the country and if we can\u2019t even figure it out there, we\u2019re going to have problems,\u201d said Samaras, the climate resilience researcher.</p> <p>\u201cTo me this is a real learning opportunity to find where the resilience gaps are, find out who\u2019s vulnerable, and fix it before it gets worse,\u201d said Samaras. \u201cThis is the challenge, not just for PG&amp;E but for the whole ecosystem: businesses, municipalities, counties. What\u2019s the plan?\u201d</p>",

PG&amp;E may be a public utility \u2013 the biggest electric utility in the US \u2013 and it may have been shutting off its lines to millions of people in the interest of public safety, but it is not, and has never been, owned by the public. With their huge monopoly markets and guaranteed rates of return, California utilities are attractive businesses for investors. Earlier this year, utilities asked the state for an even bigger payday. Meanwhile, PG&amp;E invested millions in state lobbying, paid out $4.5bn in profits to shareholders over the last five years, and millions in executive bonuses \u2013 all while deferring necessary maintenance and repairs to its system. \u201cA lot of money went to dividends that should\u2019ve gone to your trees,\u201d a federal judge told the company in April. PG&amp;E equipment has been blamed for sparking 17 out of 23 major fires across the state in 2017, and the 2018 Camp fire that all but destroyed the town of Paradise and killed 85 people. Following those two devastating fire seasons, PG&amp;E filed for bankruptcy protection to cover its liability costs, which are expected to total upwards of $30bn, compared with the company\u2019s market cap of $20bn. Any liabilities incurred from a new, large, devastating wildfire might have affected the company\u2019s ongoing bankruptcy proceedings. While PG&amp;E\u2019s 2019 Wildfire Safety Plan calls for the kind of maintenance the company shirked in the past \u2013 increased vegetation management around lines, more inspections and repairs on equipment, and additional weather stations \u2013 the backbone of the plan is de-energization. Depending on how PG&amp;E assesses the fire risk and the potential failure of the grid at any given time, the plan calls for shutting down up to 30,700 miles of transmission and distribution lines, about 25% of the grid, potentially impacting all 5.4m PG&amp;E accounts, or roughly 16 million people. Power lines, fire risk and climate changed weather As officials in Oakland, California, prepared the public for large portions of the city to go dark this week, they released a statement that read, in part: \u201cThe decision to turn off power, and the speed at which it is restored, is planned and managed solely by PG&amp;E.\u201d But it\u2019s planning and management that are regulated by the state utility commission, which worked to update de-energizing rules throughout 2018 and 2019, requiring utilities to make \u201call feasible and appropriate attempts to notify customers\u201d of a shutoff. \u201cThe public safety power shutoff is a government policy being implemented by the Public Utilities Commission. There\u2019s lots of executive branch authority over this situation,\u201d said Leah Stokes, utilities researcher and political science professor at UC Santa Barbara. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a blunt instrument to use on the problem.\u201d After this week, there are many open questions as to how PG&amp;E considers the problem and assesses fire risk. \u201cThe forecast didn\u2019t call for unprecedented extreme fire weather conditions. The power shutoff was unprecedented, but the weather conditions were not,\u201d said Daniel Swain, climate scientist at UCLA\u2019s Institute of the Environment and Sustainability. \u201cIt isn\u2019t entirely clear what did go into that decision. We don\u2019t know publicly what PG&amp;E\u2019s thresholds are.\u201d State rules leave utilities to control when they will shut down the power, and how they will choose to do it. PG&amp;E\u2019s de-energizing plan calls for the consideration of a variety of criteria and conditions when it comes to initiating a public safety power shutoff. According to the plan, \u201cNo single factor drives a Public Safety Power Shutoff.\u201d Some factors include: a national weather service \u201cred flag warning\u201d of high fire weather, low humidity levels, forecasted sustained winds, the availability of dry vegetation or fuels, and \u201con-the-ground, real-time observations from PG&amp;E crews\u201d. But there are no hard rules or numbers by which PG&amp;E abides when deciding whether or not to subjectively shut off the grid to millions of people in California. California could easily meet those vague criteria a few times a year, said Swain. \u201cIf this is the risk aversion strategy that a private utility is going to take but we\u2019re going to be hitting those thresholds an awful lot in the present climate and might hit it even more frequently in a warmer future climate, that doesn\u2019t seem to be a very realistic long-term solution,\u201d said Swain. \u201cThe notion of doing this for anything short of a real emergency puts a huge burden on a lot of people.\u201d Regulatory and ownership solutions And even as a business decision, for PG&amp;E, it\u2019s an inherently shortsighted one. \u201cYou\u2019re losing a lot of money by putting people out of power versus if you were undergrounding lines, or made microgrids, or solar and battery backup,\u201d said Stokes. \u201cYou could make those investments once and then have benefits in the future. Now you just have the costs without those investments.\u201d It\u2019s this kind of management that\u2019s inspired a campaign to take the electricity grid into public ownership. \u201cThere\u2019s a fundamental contradiction between PG&amp;E\u2019s mandate to make as much profit as they can for their shareholders and invest in the health and safety of Californians,\u201d said Keith Brower Brown, co-chair of the East Bay chapter of Democratic Socialists of America, which launched a campaign for the public takeover of PG&amp;E in 2018. \u201cWe\u2019re not naive to the fact that there have been public utilities that have had problems too \u2013 just because something\u2019s public doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s run well. But there\u2019s a path to accountability when you have public control.\u201d But more control and regulation alone won\u2019t necessarily fix PG&amp;E\u2019s management, nor the grid itself. \u201cThe only way out of this bind is not only public ownership of the company but a massive scale public investment in building the kind of safe, clean energy infrastructure that we need,\u201d said Brown. As it stands, those investments and priorities are controlled and directed by a profit-motivated PG&amp;E. Newsom, the California governor, warned that changes to PG&amp;E will come slowly \u2013 the company operates more than 125,000 transmission and distribution power lines across roughly 70,000 square miles of the state. PG&amp;E previously put the cost of inspecting and repairing every bit of its grid at $150bn. So the public is left to bear the costs and risks in the meantime of a new kind of disaster, along with the familiar ones. \u201cNobody is investing for climate resilience at the level that\u2019s necessary and that\u2019s really what\u2019s concerning about this incident \u2013 this is one of the richest areas of the country and if we can\u2019t even figure it out there, we\u2019re going to have problems,\u201d said Samaras, the climate resilience researcher. \u201cTo me this is a real learning opportunity to find where the resilience gaps are, find out who\u2019s vulnerable, and fix it before it gets worse,\u201d said Samaras. \u201cThis is the challenge, not just for PG&amp;E but for the whole ecosystem: businesses, municipalities, counties. What\u2019s the plan?\u201d",

Donald Trump has also raised the possibility of imposing sanctions on Ankara. There were reports on Friday of airstrikes and shelling in Ras al-Ayn and Tel Abyad, the Kurdish-held towns that have borne the brunt of the fighting, as Turkish ground troops and their allies sought to close in on both. Thousands of civilians have fled from both towns as well as surrounding villages, and a camp of at least 4,000 displaced Syrians near Ras al-Ayn has been evacuated after Turkish artillery landed nearby, Kurdish administrators said. The UN on Friday estimated that 100,000 people have fled from their homes in north-eastern Syria in the past few days, adding that a growing number had taken refuge in shelters and schools. Turkey\u2019s vice-president said on Friday evening that his country\u2019s troops had advanced five miles into north-eastern Syria. Kurdish activists reported at least one car bomb explosion outside a popular restaurant in the town of Qamishli on Friday afternoon, amid fears that Islamic State might use the fighting to launch its own attacks. A Kurdish media collective, the Rojava Information Centre, said one person was killed and no group has yet claimed responsibility. Tel Abyad\u2019s hospital was closed after most of its staff left, M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res said. \u201cOur staff in Tel Abyad witnessed the town, that was once filled with life, become deserted,\u201d said Robert Onus, the group\u2019s emergency manager for Syria. The US defence secretary, Mark Esper, told his Turkish counterpart to halt the offensive or risk \u201cserious consequences for Turkey\u201d, but it is unclear what effect that would have on a government in Ankara that believes it has the backing of the US president. \u201cWhile the secretary reaffirmed [that] we value our strategic bilateral relationship, this incursion risks serious consequences for Turkey,\u201d Esper told Turkey\u2019s defence minister, Hulusi Akar, in a phone call.

About 64,000 people have fled Syria since the campaign began, according to the International Rescue Committee aid group. The Kurdish Red Crescent said on Thursday night that 11 civilians had been killed in the fighting, including an 11-year-old boy in Qamishli. Clashes were reported overnight at different spots along the border, from Ain Diwar at the Iraqi frontier, to Kobane, more than 250 miles (400km) to the west. Kurdish officials in al-Hawl camp, where around 400 guards watch over more than 60,000 female members of Isis and their children, claimed there were violent demonstrations on Friday morning which they characterised as a failed escape attempt. Such unrest has been frequent in the camp in recent months. The reports of the fighting, as well as concerns over the fate of about 11,000 detained Isis fighters and their families fuelled criticism of the Turkish offensive in Washington, where the president is under increasing pressure to lay down red lines for Ankara. Trump\u2019s abrupt decision on Sunday to clear US soldiers from the Turkish-Syrian border in effect gave Turkey a green light to attack the US-backed and Kurdish-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). It has led to withering criticism from his allies in Congress, the evangelical movement and Israel. Trump said on Thursday that he hoped he could mediate between Turkey and the SDF but kept open the possibility of doing \u201csomething very, very tough with respect to sanctions and other financial things\u201d against Ankara.

      "bodyText": "Rudy Giuliani, personal lawyer to Donald Trump, is facing fresh scrutiny over reports that he tried to secure the release of one of his clients in a prisoner swap with Turkey, and over his dealings with Ukraine. One incident occurred when the former New York mayor was representing Reza Zarrab, an Iranian Turkish gold trader accused of helping a state-owned Turkish bank funnel more than $10bn worth of gold and cash to Iran in defiance of US sanctions. In an Oval Office meeting in 2017, Giuliani pushed for Zarrab to be released as part of a potential prisoner swap with Turkey, the New York Times reported on Friday. There was a swift objection from Rex Tillerson, then secretary of state, \u201cwho argued that it would be highly inappropriate to interfere in an open criminal case, according to two people briefed on the meeting\u201d, the paper added. Giuliani, who was not yet Trump\u2019s lawyer, did not accept Tillerson\u2019s objection and continued to argue. \u201cRather than side with his secretary of state, Mr Trump told them to work it out themselves, according to the two people briefed on the meeting,\u201d the paper said. The prisoner swap did not take place. Separately, the New York Times reported that federal prosecutors in Manhattan are investigating whether Giuliani broke lobbying laws in his dealings with Ukraine. The investigation is reportedly connected to the case of two Giuliani associates who have been charged with campaign finance violations for channeling foreign money into Trump\u2019s campaign. Giuliani has emerged as a central figure in the impeachment scandal triggered by Trump\u2019s phone call with the president of Ukraine, in which he requested an investigation into Joe Biden, his potential opponent in next year\u2019s election. The former New York mayor had been pushing Ukrainian officials to investigate Biden\u2019s son, Hunter. This week two of Giuliani\u2019s associates in that effort were arrested on charges of violating federal campaign finance laws. A whistleblower complaint, which sparked the formal impeachment inquiry against Trump, refers to Giuliani 31 times. It paints a picture of a lawyer who in the service of his old friend and now personal client \u2013 Trump \u2013 allegedly circumvented national security protocols as he travelled between Washington and Kyiv carrying private orders from the president, many of dubious legality. A separate report by the Bloomberg agency this week said Trump pressured Tillerson to help persuade the justice department to drop a criminal case against Zarrab. \u201cTillerson refused, arguing it would constitute interference in an ongoing investigation of the trader,\u201d according to Bloomberg. \u201cTillerson immediately repeated his objections to then-Chief of Staff John Kelly in a hallway conversation just outside the Oval Office, emphasizing that the request would be illegal,\u201d the report said. Giuliani told Bloomberg earlier this month: \u201cSuppose I did talk to Trump about it \u2013 so what? I was a private lawyer at the time. Maybe I\u2019m wrong. Maybe at some point I dropped his name in a conversation. Or maybe one of his people talked to him about it because I was trying to do a prisoner swap.\u201d And in an interview with the New York Times, he compared his efforts to the spy exchanges that took place during the cold war. \u201cIt happened to be a good trade,\u201d he said. \u201cI expected to be a hero like in a Tom Hanks movie.\u201d Ed Pilkington contributed to this report",

The first evacuations began at around 10:30pm on Thursday and were not finished until about 4am Friday, she said. A total of 278 juvenile prisoners and 56 staff members were evacuated to Los Padrinos juvenile hall about 40 miles south.</p> <p>\u201cIt takes very, very long to get that methodically done,\u201d Webb said, saying \u201csecurity\u201d concerns dictate how they transport people. She said the youth in the facility are generally ages 15 to 19 and are \u201chigh risk\u201d and \u201chigh need\u201d, adding, \u201cAt the end of the day, they are kids. So they were scared. The fire was right there.\u201d </p> <p>Kim McGill, an organizer with the Youth Justice Coalition, an organization that works with families of the incarcerated youth, told the Guardian that parents were were worried and struggling to get information as the fire spread. </p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s just not the same urgency when people are locked up. It seems county officials aren\u2019t thinking about the safety of the people inside,\u201d she said. \u201cThese families want to feel that they are just as important.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/YouthJusticeLA/status/1182751190221606912\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Urgent Update:<br>Emergency Evacuation of Barry J.

I know people think that\u2019s slow, but that was fast.\u201d</p> <p>Asked if there was a way the evacuations could have gone faster, she said if the staff couldn\u2019t get the youth out in time, the worst case scenario would involve them sheltering in place with the fire department forming a shield around the facility.

Here\u2019s a recap of what happened and where things stand: Southern California Edison turned off electricity to about 20,000 people in Los Angeles, Ventura, San Bernardino and Kern counties but warned that thousands more could lose service as Santa Ana winds gained strength. The Saddleridge fire, which started in Sylmar, had consumed more than 7,500 acres by 5pm local time Friday, prompting California\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom, to declare a state of emergency. Officials said a middle-aged man died near where the fire was burning after he went into cardiac arrest, and that a firefighter suffered an eye injury. Authorities also ordered mandatory evacuations of about 100,000 people in the Granada Hills, Porter Ranch and Oakridge Estates neighborhoods. A juvenile prison located directly next to the massive Saddleridge fire took more than five hours to evacuate in the middle of the night, sparking some criticisms and concerns from advocates. A blaze also ripped through a mobile home park in Calimesa, a city about 65 miles (104km) east of Los Angeles, destroying dozens of residences. An 89-year-old woman, Lois Arvickson, died while on the phone with her son. Red flag fire warnings are expected to continue in southern California through Saturday. In northern California, PG&amp;E started restoring power to some of the communities that were cut off on Wednesday and Thursday. PG&amp;E suggested it was already seeing the wisdom of its decision borne out as gusts topping 77mph (122km/h) raked the San Francisco Bay Area amid a bout of dry, windy weather. Northern California fire officials say a man dependent on oxygen died roughly 12 minutes after PG&amp;E shut down power to the area. A juvenile prison located directly next to the massive Saddleridge fire took more than five hours to evacuate in the middle of the night, sparking some criticisms and concerns from advocates. Barry J Nidorf juvenile hall in Sylmar, which incarcerates teenagers, was so close to the fire that embers appeared to be hitting the facility, said Kerri Webb, a spokesperson. The first evacuations began at around 10:30pm on Thursday and were not finished until about 4am Friday, she said. A total of 278 juvenile prisoners and 56 staff members were evacuated to Los Padrinos juvenile hall about 40 miles south. \u201cIt takes very, very long to get that methodically done,\u201d Webb said, saying \u201csecurity\u201d concerns dictate how they transport people. She said the youth in the facility are generally ages 15 to 19 and are \u201chigh risk\u201d and \u201chigh need\u201d, adding, \u201cAt the end of the day, they are kids. So they were scared. The fire was right there.\u201d Kim McGill, an organizer with the Youth Justice Coalition, an organization that works with families of the incarcerated youth, told the Guardian that parents were were worried and struggling to get information as the fire spread. \u201cThere\u2019s just not the same urgency when people are locked up. It seems county officials aren\u2019t thinking about the safety of the people inside,\u201d she said. \u201cThese families want to feel that they are just as important.\u201d Watching the news of the fire unfold, McGill said it felt like \u201cpeople\u2019s property and horses were given more concern\u201d than the incarcerated youth. She said the facility\u2019s response this year seemed improved from previous years, but that there was a broader problem in California of a lack of clear plans to evacuate imprisoned people in a timely manner and promptly notify loved ones. \u201cIt\u2019s a lack of concern or even altogether forgetting of the hundreds of thousands of people detained in prisons and jails and juvenile halls.\u201d In an email sent to families, the Youth Justice Coalition said: We continue to be concerned that County Probation Department, Sheriffs Department and State Prison officials have no or inadequate fire safety plans, evacuation resources and family notification measures in place, despite the fact that California is the region of the nation that experiences the most fires as well as the highest levels of respiratory illness. Webb said parents and guardians were notified of the transfer by around noon on Friday, adding that the facility followed its protocols and worked with fire officials: \u201cIt was done very cautiously with a lot of security, with safety in mind 100% of the time ... I know people think that\u2019s slow, but that was fast.\u201d Asked if there was a way the evacuations could have gone faster, she said if the staff couldn\u2019t get the youth out in time, the worst case scenario would involve them sheltering in place with the fire department forming a shield around the facility. She said it did not appear that there was ultimately damage. Governor Gavin Newsom has just declared a state of emergency in Los Angeles and Riverside counties due to the fires. From his office: Newsom today issued an emergency proclamation for Los Angeles and Riverside counties due to the effects of several fires, including the Saddleridge, Eagle, Sandalwood, Reche, and Wolf fires, which have destroyed structures, threatened homes and critical infrastructure, and caused the evacuation of tens of thousands of residents. Earlier today, Newsom announced that the state has secured a Fire Management Assistance Grant from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to help ensure the availability of resources to fight the Saddleridge Fire. The El Sereno fire, which ignited earlier today in LA, has doubled in size in about an hour-long period \u2013 from 20 acres to 40 acres: The fire department says crews have \u201cfully surrounded\u201d it and that authorities are continuing to do water drops. No injuries or damaged structures have been reported. It\u2019s a good reminder of how precarious the situation remains: Video from earlier this afternoon: In southern California, some residents are now returning to their homes to assess the destruction and damage. Some dramatic scenes from journalists on the ground: PG&amp;E\u2019s decision to shut off the power on nearly 2m customers across three dozen California counties could cost the region more than $2bn, according to some financial experts. My colleague Mario Koran reports: But the precautionary outage created its own dilemmas, closing schools, shutting down traffic lights and leaving hospitals to rely on generators. Economic impact will probably be felt across business sectors, including restaurants, transportation and grocery stores. Insurance for stores like supermarkets doesn\u2019t typically cover planned power outages, only outages caused by natural disasters like earthquakes, Ronald Fong, CEO of the California Grocers Association, told the AP. The stores will have to eat those costs. Portions of wine country north of San Francisco, torched by wildfires in 2017, stayed dark for most of the day Wednesday and Thursday. The county\u2019s economic development board is preparing to study the local costs of the shutdown and will send out a survey to area businesses once power is restored. \u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of precedent for how to calculate the impact,\u201d said Lauren Cartwright, a board spokesperson. Read the full story here: Lois Arvickson, 89, died in the Sandalwood fire in Riverside County, according to the LA Times: Arvickson was reportedly on the phone with her son when the flames arrived at the mobile park where she lived. That fire was started by burning trash and swept through a mobile park home, causing significant damage. Officials said earlier today that remains were found inside one of the mobile homes, and that there were two people still missing who lived at the park, according to the Times. Fire authorities also said they were working with arson investigators and a homicide unit to determine if criminal charges were warranted in the death. The fire destroyed more than 70 homes and buildings. There are now reports of another brush fire in southern California in El Sereno, about 25 miles southeast of the Sylmar fire: This new fire has grown to about 20 acres Responders are working to stop the fire from hitting threatened homes with water-dropping helicopters. This fire began around 11:30am local time. From the LA fire department: Northern California fire officials say a man dependent on oxygen died roughly 12 minutes after PG&amp;E shut down power to the area, the AP reports. El Dorado county\u2019s fire chief, Lloyd Ogan, said fire personnel responded to a call in Pollock Pines that came in after 3:30am Wednesday. He said crews arrived to find an unresponsive man in his 60s and were unable to revive him. Ogan said the man\u2019s oxygen equipment required power, but could not say whether the shutdown was related to his death. A PG&amp;E spokesperson told the AP the utility has not been able to confirm the accuracy of the report. I\u2019ve also asked for comment and will update if I hear back. Here\u2019s an earlier piece from my colleague Vivian Ho about possible impacts on medically vulnerable people: In southern California, officials at a press briefing just said the Sylmar fire had spread to 7,500 acres and was 13% contained. Roughly 25 homes have suffered severe impacts and damage. There are still 100,000 people under evacuation orders. An LA fire department official said that while it appeared there was a \u201clull in activity\u201d people should not be \u201cfooled\u201d: There\u2019s a lot of potential for growth in this fire. It\u2019s going to be a number of days. Some scenes on the ground: More harrowing stories of frantic escapes are emerging in the southern California fires: A PG&amp;E spokesperson has just sent me this statement about the SF Chronicle\u2019s report revealing that executives were wining and dining in Sonoma county as the utility was planning to shut down power for millions of people: PG&amp;E held an event on Tuesday in Sonoma County to recognize large gas customers who help provide stability to the gas transmission system and access to gas supply markets. The annual event has been held for over twenty years. Approximately 60 people attended including a handful of PG&amp;E gas representatives. To be clear, our Corporation and Utility CEOs did not attend the event and were in the company\u2019s emergency operations center leading the effort around the Public Safety Power Shutoff underway. While the event was planned for about a year, we sincerely apologize for the insensitivity of the timing and location of the event, given the two-year milestone of the 2017 North Bay wildfires. Moving forward, we will no longer hold these types of events. We can never forget these tragic events, which profoundly affected our customers and all Californians. The event was funded by shareholders, and did not come from customer dollars, according to the statement. PG&amp;E is facing widespread scrutiny for its decision to shut down power to millions, with critics saying the utility has failed at their maintenance obligations and was not adequately prepared for this predictable crisis. In southern California, winds are expected to diminish later this afternoon, but meteorologists say they could still be strong enough to continue the spread of the Saddleridge fire and others: Meanwhile, the LA department of water and power says it has restored power to nearly all of its customers in Granada Hills affected by the fire. The utility says 21 customers remain without power due to fire-related damage: PG&amp;E now says that power has been restored to roughly 74% of customers impacted by the shutoffs: Some specifics on the latest numbers of those restored\u201d Alameda County: 86% Contra Costa County: 95% Marin County: 80% Napa County: 75% San Mateo County: 86% Santa Clara: 94% Solano County: 96% Sonoma County: 78% PG&amp;E has said that crews need to inspect equipment and lines before power is restored and that in some cases that process could take multiple days. A few videos of the fire devastation in southern California from people on the ground: PG&amp;E executives were wining and dining on the company\u2019s dime in Sonoma county as the utility was planning to shut down power for millions of people across California, the San Francisco Chronicle is reporting: Roughly a dozen employees from PG&amp;E\u2019s gas side of the business mingled with 50 to 60 top customers at a winery on Monday and Tuesday, according to thew newspaper. The trip to the winery also came two years after PG&amp;E poles ignited deadly and devastating wildfires in that exact region of wine country. Here\u2019s what Bill Johnson, CEO of the utility\u2019s parent company, told the Chronicle: I want to apologize to every one of our customers. Insensitive, inappropriate, tone deaf are the terms I would use to describe this. Johnson also told the reporter he was not aware the event was happening and would have stopped it if he had known. I just reached out to PG&amp;E to see if they have any additional comment and will update if I hear back. For those displaced by the Saddleridge fire in northern LA, a fifth evacuation center has opened: Info on the centers, from the fire department: NEW and OPEN for arrivals: Lanark Recreation Center (21816 Lanark St) FULL: Sylmar Recreation Center (13109 Borden Ave) FULL: Northridge Recreation Center (18300 Lemarsh St) FULL: Granada Hills Recreation Center is now full and not able to accept any more residents.

A person was killed when a fire swept through a mobile home park in Riverside county east of Los Angeles, Cal Fire spokeswoman Cathey Mattingly told the AP. Mattingly said there were also some injuries, but details of the severity were unclear. There were also few details about the individual who died. The Riverside county fire was estimated to be about 823 acres (333 hectares) and 10% contained this morning. In LA at a separate fire, a man went into cardiac arrest and died. In northern California, the impacts of the controversial Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&amp;E) power cuts are being disproportionately borne by those who are physically vulnerable, my colleague Vivian Ho reports: Deanne Mediati learned of northern California\u2019s massive power shutoff when her husband shook her awake at 3:30 in the morning on Wednesday. \u201cHoney, the power is out,\u201d he told her. \u201cYou\u2019re not breathing.\u201d Mediati, 59, has hypoxia and requires an oxygen concentrator to breathe when she sleeps. Like everything else running on electricity in 600,000 Californian homes and businesses this week, her oxygen concentrator stopped working when the country\u2019s largest utility company cut power to an unprecedented swath of the state as a preventive measure against wildfires. For Californians like Mediati who rely on electronic medical devices, access to electricity is a matter of life or death. \u201cI had to be woken up because I stopped breathing,\u201d Mediati said. \u201cI could have died.\u201d In the latest shutoff in northern California, Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&amp;E) cut the power to portions of 34 of the state\u2019s 58 counties on Wednesday, a move that affects more than 1.5 million people. Of those affected, more than 30,000 are part of a medical baseline program, meaning they have special energy needs due to qualifying medical conditions. These energy needs range from motorized wheelchairs, ventilators, dialysis machines, apnea monitors, electrostatic nebulizers to respirators \u2013 all of which require power to operate. In the aftermath of the shutdown, people dependent on these devices were scrambling to find alternative power sources, places to charge them or other ways to get through what was originally slated to be up to five to seven days of no electricity. Read her full story here: Welcome to our live coverage of the wildfires and power shutoffs plaguing the state of California today. We\u2019ll be keeping you updated on the latest developments. I\u2019m writing from Los Angeles, where the Saddleridge fire is continuing to spread and spark widespread evacuations. To start, a quick summary of the status of these emergencies: In northern Los Angeles, a rapidly spreading wildfire has led to evacuation orders for roughly 100,000 people across more than 20,000 homes. The Saddleridge fire erupted Thursday night in Sylmar, the northernmost portion of the San Fernando valley, and it has spread at a rate of roughly 800 acres an hour into Granada Hills and Porter Ranch. Fire officials said Friday morning the fire had grown to more than seven square miles and estimated that there was damage to at least 25 homes. One middle-aged man died of a cardiac arrest near the fire, though specific details of the death were unclear. A separate blaze also ripped through a mobile home park in Calimesa, a city roughly 65 miles (104km) east of LA, destroying dozens of residences. Southern California Edison turned off electricity to about 20,000 people in Los Angeles, Ventura, San Bernardino and Kern counties but warned that thousands more could lose service as Santa Ana winds gained strength. In northern California, PG&amp;E had shut off power to an estimated 2 million people over fears its equipment could spark wildfires amid high winds. PG&amp;E has started the process of restoring power to some of the communities that were cut off on Wednesday and Thursday. Our latest story here:",

Meanwhile, the Chinese embassy issued a statement saying: \u201cWe categorically reject Mr Dutton\u2019s irrational accusations against China, which are shocking and baseless.\u201d While drawing a clear distinction between \u201cthe amazing Chinese diaspora community in Australia\u201d and the Chinese government, Dutton said Australia needed to have a \u201cfrank conversation\u201d over China\u2019s global influence, its infrastructure Belt and Road Initiative, expansionism in the South China Sea and growing military and aid presence in the Indo-Pacific. Dutton\u2019s comments are, by some margin, the strongest criticism of the Chinese government by a serving Australian minister. The Chinese embassy described Dutton\u2019s comments as \u201canti-China rhetoric\u201d. \u201cWe strongly condemn his malicious slur on the Communist Party of China, which constitutes an outright provocation to the Chinese people,\u201d the embassy statement said. \u201cSuch ridiculous rhetoric severely harms the mutual trust between China and Australia and betrays the common interests of the two peoples.\u201d Dutton said China\u2019s actions on the global stage often conflicted with Australian values and were incompatible with democratic forms of government. \u201cWe have a very important trading relationship with China, incredibly important, but we\u2019re not going to allow university students to be unduly influenced,\u201d Dutton said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to allow theft of intellectual property and we\u2019re not going to allow our government bodies or non-government bodies to be hacked into. \u201cOur issue, as I\u2019ve said before, is not with the Chinese people, not with the amazing Chinese diaspora community that we have here in Australia.

I wish there were more adults in the Coalition party room and government. \u201cThey\u2019re saying these things for domestic political point-scoring, not for Australia\u2019s national interests.\u201d Relations between the Australian and Chinese governments are strained over a number of long-running issues. Canberra has protested over Chinese government interference in Australia, particularly in politics and education, while Beijing has been volubly displeased at Australia\u2019s new foreign interference laws, and the banning of Chinese telco Huawei from building any of Australia\u2019s 5G network, citing national security concerns. Beijing has criticised Australia\u2019s position that China should no longer be recognised as a \u201cdeveloping\u201d country by the World Trade Organisation but rather as a \u201cnewly developed\u201d one. Australia has also spoken out strongly over the continued detention of Australian writer and democracy activist Yang Hengjun, who has been held in Beijing for seven months and potentially faces the death penalty over alleged espionage. Australia strongly suspects his arrest is politically motivated and that there is no evidence to support the charges. While it has not been confirmed, Australia\u2019s intelligence agencies also believe Chinese hackers were behind attacks on the Australian National University, as well as on political parties, and the Parliament House computer system. The government has established a taskforce to safeguard Australian universities from foreign interference, after concerns were raised about Chinese academics collaborating on security, surveillance and defence technology-related projects in Australia. Dutton\u2019s comments on China on Friday came as the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, visited Suva for talks with his Fijian counterpart, Frank Bainimarama, the pair greeting each other with a hug. The two prime ministers announced Pacific Islanders living in Australia will be able to bring double the amount of kava \u2013 from 2kg to 4kg \u2013 into the country under new relaxed regulations. A trial program for the commercial importation of kava \u2013 the roots of the kava plant are used to make a bitter, sedative drink that holds strong cultural significance in the Pacific \u2013 will begin next year. Morrison, accompanied by the foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, and the minister for international development and the Pacific, Alex Hawke, will visit the Black Rock military base, a key regional training hub for police and peacekeepers at the weekend. Australia is funding the development of Black Rock, having effectively outbid China for the right to contribute to the project. Morrison drove over the Fiji-China friendship bridge on the way to his meeting with Bainimarama, held nearby to a 30-storey tower being built by Beijing, soon to be the tallest building in the Pacific islands. During the Pacific Islands Forum in Tuvalu in August, Bainimarama said Australia\u2019s heavy-handed attitude during discussions on climate change was driving Pacific countries towards closer ties with China. Describing Morrison as \u201cvery insulting, very condescending\u201d, Bainimarama said: \u201cChina never insults the Pacific.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s a rundown of the top stories of the day: Maria Yovanovitch testified to the House impeachment inquiry, in defiance of an order by the state department. Yovanovitch said in her opening statement to the House committees that she was told Trump placed pressure on the state department to recall her. Shep Smith, the Fox News anchor who has repeatedly criticized Trump, announced that he was resigning. Trump announced that the US and China have reached a \u201cphase one\u201d agreement on a trade deal, but it has not yet been written. The administration added that the new tariffs on Chinese imports, which were set to go into effect on Tuesday, had been canceled. The Trump administration suffered multiple legal defeats. Namely, a federal appeals court upheld House Democrats\u2019 subpoena for the president\u2019s financial records, and two of Trump\u2019s controversial immigration policies were blocked by judges. The Pentagon announced it would send more troops to Saudi Arabia, despite Trump\u2019s insistence this week that he was withdrawing troops from northern Syria to reduce America\u2019s military presence in the Middle East. Kevin McAleenan, the acting secretary of homeland security, resigned. McAleenan was the fourth person to hold the position under Trump. Here\u2019s McAleenan\u2019s statement: Kevin McAleenan has resigned as acting secretary of homeland security. McAleenan had only been in the position since April, when he was appointed acting secretary to replace Kirstjen Nielsen. Nielsen succeeded John Kelly in the job when Kelly was tapped to be Trump\u2019s White House chief of staff. (Update to clarify: Elaine Duke served as acting secretary for six months between Kelly and Nielsen.) McAleenan was never formerly nominated for the Cabinet position, which would have required senate confirmation. Prior to his appointment with DHS, he worked in various positions with Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and was confirmed as commissioner of CBP in March 2018. Just last week, he spoke to the Washington Post about what the paper described as his \u201cunease\u201d with a law enforcement agency being used for partisan political purposes. \u201cWhat I don\u2019t have control over is the tone, the message, the public face and approach of the department in an increasingly polarized time,\u201d he told the Washington Post. \u201cThat\u2019s uncomfortable, as the accountable, senior figure.\u201d Donald Trump just tweeted that Kevin McAleenan, the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security, is leaving the administration to \u201cspend more time with his family and go to the private sector\u201d. Trump also said that a new acting secretary will be named next said. Facebook has been under pressure all week over its decision to exempt politicians from a policy banning false statements from advertisements. Now Elizabeth Warren \u2013 who has responded to Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s leaked remarks promising to \u201cgo to the mat and ... fight\u201d her plan to break Facebook up by, well, going to the mat and fighting \u2013 is running intentionally false ads to critique the company. Warren\u2019s ad goes on to correct the record, unlike a controversial set of Trump ads that deceptively promote misleading information about Joe Biden. I wrote more about the contretemps and what it tells us about Facebook here. A Facebook spokesman told CNN: \u201cIf Senator Warren wants to say things she knows to be untrue, we believe Facebook should not be in the position of censoring that speech.\u201d The Commission on Presidential Debates today announced the dates and locations for three presidential debates and one vice presidential debate next year. The presidential debates will be: Tuesday 29 September 2020 at the University of Notre Dame Thursday 15 October 2020 at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor Thursday 22 October 2020 at Belmont University in Nashville, Tennessee The vice presidential debate will be on Wednesday 7 October 2020 at the University of Utah, Salt Lake City. Mark your calendars! It sounds like the Trump campaign is ignoring the Prince estate\u2019s demand that it stop using his music at campaign events. The justice department has waded into Trump\u2019s fight to continue concealing his tax returns by filing a brief supporting the president\u2019s appeal of a Monday court ruling, the New York Times reports. The case stems from efforts by Manhattan district attorney Cy Vance to subpoena Trump\u2019s tax returns as part of an investigation into the hush-money payments made to Stormy Daniels during Trump\u2019s campaign. Trump sued to stop the subpoena, but on Monday a federal judge rejected his arguments, calling them \u201crepugnant to the nation\u2019s governmental structure and constitutional values\u201d. Trump is now appealing that decision, and today the justice department filed a brief in his support. The appeals court will hear arguments on 23 October. Michael McKinley, a career foreign service officer and the de facto chief of staff to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, announced his resignation on Friday, the AP reports. McKinley\u2019s departure adds to what the AP describes as \u201ctumult in the State Department over the Trump administration\u2019s handling of Ukraine and treatment of diplomats\u201d. Per the AP: Michael McKinley announced his retirement after a nearly four-decade career as an American diplomat. McKinley told colleagues he was leaving for personal reasons, and officials did not directly link his departure to the Ukraine situation that is now at the center of an impeachment probe. McKinley\u2019s resignation took effect Friday, the same day the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine told congressional investigators that she had been removed from her post due to political pressure from the White House. Beto O\u2019Rourke says that he raised $4.5m in the past three months, CNN reports. The total ranks him ninth among the Democratic presidential candidates, who are, in order of the total raised in the third quarter: Bernie Sanders Elizabeth Warren Pete Buttigieg Joe Biden Kamala Harris Andrew Yang Cory Booker Amy Klobuchar Beto O\u2019Rourke Marianne Williamson Steve Bullock Michael Bennet Tom Steyer These self-reported announcements only give us the topline numbers for fundraising information. Stay tuned for next week, when the candidates file their disclosures with the FEC and we\u2019ll be able to bring you much more analysis of who these donors are. Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s personal attorney... Hello everyone, this is Julia Carrie Wong in San Francisco picking up the live blog for the rest of this busy Friday. Adam Schiff, the chair of the House intelligence committee, has written a letter to house Democrats describing the progress thus far in the impeachment inquiry and promising that the process will \u201caccelerate\u201d. The letter notes that depositions are scheduled for the following witnesses: Dr Fiona Hill, former National Security Council director for European and Russian affairs, George Kent, deputy assistant secretary of state, who oversees policy on Ukraine and other countries, Gordon Sondlond, ambassador to the EU, and T Ulrich Brechbuhl, counselor of the state department Schiff added that additional witnesses will be announced in the coming days. That\u2019s it from me this week. My west coast colleague, Julia Carrie Wong, will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: The Democratic chairmen of the House committees leading the impeachment inquiry said that the state department (at the direction of the White House) told Maria Yovanovitch not to testify, an order that the the former US ambassador to Ukraine defied. Yovanovitch said in her opening statement to the House committees that she was told Trump placed pressure on the state department to recall her. Shep Smith, the Fox News anchor who has repeatedly criticized Trump, announced that he was resigning. Trump announced that the US and China have reached a \u201cphase one\u201d agreement on a trade deal, but it has not yet been written. The administration added that the new tariffs on Chinese imports, which were set to go into effect on Tuesday, had been canceled. The Trump administration suffered multiple legal defeats. Namely, a federal appeals court upheld House Democrats\u2019 subpoena for the president\u2019s financial records, and two of Trump\u2019s controversial immigration policies were blocked by judges. The Pentagon announced it would send more troops to Saudi Arabia, despite Trump\u2019s insistence this week that he was withdrawing troops from northern Syria to reduce America\u2019s military presence in the Middle East. Julia will have more on the news of the day, so stay tuned. Trump did not seem very heartbroken at the news that Shep Smith, whom the president has repeatedly slammed for criticizing him, was leaving Fox News. Meanwhile, Maria Yovanovitch continues to testify before the House committees investigating impeachment. The former US ambassador to Ukraine arrived on Capitol Hill for her closed-door testimony more than six hours ago. In announcing his departure, Fox News anchor Shep Smith told his viewers that he had requested to leave and that the network had tried to convince him to stay. The anchor, who has previously been critical of Trump, added that he would not be reporting elsewhere for the time being. In some media news: Shep Smith, the Fox News anchor who was arguably most critical of Trump, is stepping down from his role at the network. Smith has repeatedly called out the president for his falsehoods and his treatment of journalists, a habit that has attracted Trump\u2019s scorn. Late last month, Smith condemned Trump\u2019s false corruption allegations against Joe Biden as \u201cbaseless\u201d and a \u201cconspiracy theory.\u201d Trump has said that the tariffs set to go into effect against China on Tuesday have now been canceled. Following his meeting with the Chinese vice premier, Trump said the US and China would finalize a \u201cphase one\u201d trade deal in the next few weeks. The US president claimed the deal would address intellectual property theft, a longstanding issue between the two countries, but that\u2019s not necessarily certain given that the agreement has not yet been written. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office that the US and China have reached a \u201cphase one\u201d deal on trade. Reporters at the White House are still waiting on word from Trump\u2019s meeting with the Chinese vice premier on trade talks, so there could be even more breaking news in the next hour. Politico has some helpful context on the potential ramifications of Maria Yovanovitch\u2019s decision to comply with a congressional subpoena, despite the state department (at the urging of the White House) directing the former ambassador not to testify: Unlike the last witness in the Ukraine matter to testify \u2014 former ambassador Kurt Volker \u2014 Yovanovitch is still employed by the State Department, which raises questions about whether she\u2019ll face any punishment for defying orders. Legal experts and State Department officials have been trying, without conclusion, to resolve the question of whether a congressional subpoena trumps a State Department direction to a Foreign Service officer. Senior Trump adviser Stephen Miller is now taking questions from reporters at the White House, and it is ... quite the scene. Miller would not answer when asked if he would hypothetically comply with a subpoena to testify in House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry against Trump. Trump is suffering a lot of legal defeats today. A federal judge has now placed a nationwide injunction on the administration\u2019s plan to penalize green card applicants who rely on government assistance, known as the \u201cpublic charge\u201d rule. The New York Times reports: Judge George B. Daniels of the United States District Court in the Southern District of New York said those potentially affected by the new regulation could suffer \u2018irreparable harm\u2019 if it goes into effect. \u2018The balance of equities and the interests of justice favor issuance of a preliminary injunction,\u2019 the judge wrote. The \u2018public charge\u2019 rule, which had been scheduled to take effect on Tuesday, set new standards for determining who might become a burden on the public purse and barred them from obtaining permanent residence in the country. Judge Daniels\u2019s order, which the Justice Department is likely to appeal, came a few days after President Trump also moved to deny immigrant visas to those who cannot prove that they will either have health insurance or can afford to pay for their own health care. The news will not stop coming today. A federal court has just ruled that Trump violated the law by declaring a national emergency at the US-Mexico border to get his wall built. David Smith reported this back in February: Donald Trump has defied fierce criticism to announce that he is using emergency powers to bypass Congress and pursue the building of a wall on the US-Mexico border. At a combative, rambling and at times incoherent press conference in the White House, the US president insisted he had no choice but to declare a national emergency to stop illegal immigrants spreading crime and drugs. Yet Trump admitted that he did not \u2018need\u2019 to take the step now and was only doing so for speed. Opponents seized on the remark to accuse him of falsehoods and fearmongering for political ends, describing the move as \u2018unlawful\u2019 and a violation of the US constitution. It is now clear that Marie Yovanovitch, who is still technically an employee of the state department, defied the White House\u2019s wishes in testifying before the House committees investigating impeachment. The Democratic chairman of those committees confirmed moments ago that they issued a subpoena to the former US ambassador to Ukraine to compel her to appear, which she complied with. But other Trump administration officials have ignored congressional subpoenas to adhere to the president\u2019s wishes. And that raises this question: will the White House retaliate against Yovanovitch for testifying? That certainly seemed like a possibility in the talking points that the administration issued about Yovanovitch\u2019s appearance. The White House warned in those talking points that, by testifying without a state department lawyer, Yovanovitch was in \u201cserious danger that she could breach her obligations as a current employee.\u201d The three Democratic chairman of the House committees leading the impeachment inquiry said the White House\u2019s efforts to block Marie Yovanovitch\u2019s testimony provided more evidence of obstruction. Adam Schiff, Eliot Engel and Elijah Cummings said: \u201cLast night, the Committees learned that the State Department, at the direction of the White House, directed Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch not to appear for her voluntary interview today. \u201cThis is the latest example of the Administration\u2019s efforts to conceal the facts from the American people and obstruct our lawful and constitutionally-authorized impeachment inquiry. \u201cIn response, the House Intelligence Committee issued a subpoena to compel her testimony this morning. This duly authorized subpoena is mandatory, and the illegitimate order from the Trump Administration not to cooperate has no force. As is required of her, the Ambassador is now complying with the subpoena and answering questions from both Democratic and Republican Members and staff. \u201cAny efforts by Trump Administration officials to prevent witness cooperation with the Committees will be deemed obstruction of a co-equal branch of government and an adverse inference may be drawn against the President on the underlying allegations of corruption and coverup.\u201d The Democratic chairmen of the committees leading the impeachment inquiry said that the White House had directed the state department to block Marie Yovanovitch from testifying. The committees then issued a subpoena to the former US ambassador to Ukraine. But Yovanovitch\u2019s decision to comply with the subpoena, in spite of the White House\u2019s opposition to it, is a first in House Democrats\u2019 investigations of Trump. The House committees leading the impeachment inquiry said that Marie Yovanovitch had been directed by the state department not to appear for today\u2019s hearing. In response, the committees issued a subpoena, which the former US ambassador to Ukraine complied with. A Washington Post columnist noted that, given Trump\u2019s ability to immediately order sanctions, Steven Mnuchin\u2019s announcement that the administration had \u201cauthorized\u201d sanctions against Turkey is ... effectively meaningless. The US and China have reportedly reached a partial deal in trade negotiations as Trump prepares to meet with the Chinese vice premier in the next hour. Bloomberg News reports: The U.S. and China reached a partial agreement Friday that would broker a truce in the trade war and lay the groundwork for a broader deal that Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping could sign later this year, according to people familiar with the matter, Bloomberg News reports. As part of the agreement, China would agree to some agricultural concessions and the U.S. would provide some tariff relief. The pact is tentative and subject to change as Trump prepares to sit down with China\u2019s Vice Premier Liu He later Friday. The news that Trump may agree to ratchet down some of his tariffs on Chinese imports caused US stocks to jump. Mnuchin also dodged a question about trade talks in advance of Trump\u2019s meeting with the Chinese vice premier this afternoon. Steven Mnuchin, the treasury secretary, said Trump is prepared to authorize sanctions against Turkey depending on how the country navigates its military operation in northern Syria. But Mnuchin made it very clear that the administration is not activating sanctions at the moment. He added that financial institutions should be \u201con notice\u201d that sanctions could be forthcoming. By the way, Marie Yovanovitch is still being interviewed by the House committees investigating impeachment, and it looks like we can all settle in because this isn\u2019t wrapping up anytime soon. One Democratic member of the House oversight committee just told reporters that Marie Yovanovitch appeared before lawmakers under subpoena. But no subpoena of Yovanovitch was ever publicly announced, raising the possibility that the former US ambassador to Ukraine requested one to testify. The White House has just announced that Steven Mnuchin, the treasury secretary, will speak to reporters in the briefing room in about 15 minutes. It\u2019s not clear what Mnuchin intends to address, but multiple reporters were told that he will not be discussing the US-China trade talks. Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s trade meeting with the Chinese vice premier is still set for 2:45 p.m. EST. You can read Yovanovitch\u2019s full opening statement here: Here\u2019s where this very newsy Friday stands so far: Marie Yovanovitch testified to House committees investigating impeachment that she was told Trump had pressured the state department to release her as the US ambassador to Ukraine. A federal appeals court upheld House Democrats\u2019 subpoena for eight years of Trump\u2019s financial records from his accounting firm. The Pentagon announced it would send more troops to Saudi Arabia, even as Trump has defended his decision to withdraw forces from northern Syria by saying that he was trying to get the US military out of the Middle East. The blog will have much more to come, so stay tuned. Federal authorities investigating Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman are reportedly probing the pair\u2019s relationship to Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer. Parnas and Fruman are facing campaign-finance charges, and the foreign-born Republican donors were arrested Wednesday night as they allegedly tried to flee the country. ABC News reports: The investigation is being conducted by the FBI\u2019s New York field office and prosecutors in the Southern District of New York, the same U.S. Attorney\u2019s office Giuliani ran before he became mayor of New York. ... Parnas and Fruman, two Soviet-born, Florida-based businessmen, assisted Giuliani in his effort to dig up dirt on Joe Biden and his family. The association among the three men goes back several years. Giuliani has represented Parnas and Fruman in the past. The Wall Street Journal also reported yesterday that Giuliani had lunch with Parnas and Fruman just hours before the pair were arrested at Dulles International Airport. The White House has just announced the nomination of John Sullivan, currently the deputy secretary of state, as the next US ambassador to Russia. And if that name sounds familiar to you, it\u2019s because he is the same John Sullivan who told Marie Yovanovitch that the State Department had been pressured by Trump to recall her, according to the former ambassador\u2019s opening statement to House committees this morning. Yovanovitch said of Sullivan: \u201cI met with the Deputy Secretary of State, who informed me of the curtailment of my term. He said that the President had lost confidence in me and no longer wished me to serve as his ambassador. \u201cHe added that there had been a concerted campaign against me, and that the Department had been under pressure from the President to remove me since the Summer of 2018. \u201cHe also said that I had done nothing wrong and that this was not like other situations where he had recalled ambassadors for cause. I departed Ukraine for good this past May.\u201d The blog is following news on multiple fronts right now. In addition to the release of Marie Yovanovitch\u2019s blistering opening statement to House committees, the Pentagon has just confirmed the deployment of more US troops to Saudi Arabia. The announcement comes after an attack last month on Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil facilities, which Saudi and US officials have blamed on Iran. Across the past month, US officials have announced the deployment of about 3,000 additional troops to Saudi Arabia. Marie Yovanovitch added in her opening statement to the House committees that she was told Trump had put \u201cpressure\u201d on the state department for nearly a year to recall her. The former US ambassador to Ukraine said to the lawmakers investigating impeachment: \u201cI met with the Deputy Secretary of State, who informed me of the curtailment of my term. He said that the President had lost confidence in me and no longer wished me to serve as his ambassador. \u201cHe added that there had been a concerted campaign against me, and that the Department had been under pressure from the President to remove me since the Summer of 2018. He also said that I had done nothing wrong and that this was not like other situations where he had recalled ambassadors for cause. I departed Ukraine for good this past May.\u201d In her opening statement to the House committees, Yovanovitch sought to dispel some of the smears thrown at her by far-right pundits. The former ambassador to Ukraine said: \u201cI want to categorically state that I have never myself or through others, directly or indirectly, ever directed, suggested, or in any other way asked for any government or government official in Ukraine (or elsewhere) to refrain from investigating or prosecuting actual corruption. \u201cEqually fictitious is the notion that I am disloyal to President Trump. I have heard the allegation in the media that I supposedly told the Embassy team to ignore the President\u2019s orders \u2018since he was going to be impeached.\u2019 That allegation is false. I have never said such a thing, to my Embassy colleagues or to anyone else.\u201d Yovanovitch added that she never discussed Hunter Biden or his Ukrainian company with Joe Biden or any other Obama official, although she has met the former vice president on several occasions. According to her opening statement published by the Washington Post, Marie Yovanovitch said she had few interactions with Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer. But she noted that, based on news reports, some of Giuliani\u2019s associates may have believed they would suffer financial losses due to the ambassador\u2019s anti-corruption efforts. Yovanovitch told the House committees: \u201cWith respect to Mayor Giuliani, I have had only minimal contacts with him\u2014a total of three that I recall. None related to the events at issue. I do not know Mr. Giuliani\u2019s motives for attacking me. \u201cBut individuals who have been named in the press as contacts of Mr. Giuliani may well have believed that their personal financial ambitions were stymied by our anti-corruption policy in Ukraine.\u201d Marie Yovanovitch told the House committees investigating impeachment that Trump had pushed for her removal as ambassador to Ukraine based on \u201cfalse claims\u201d, according to the New York Times. The Times reports: Marie L. Yovanovitch, who was recalled as the American ambassador to Ukraine, testified to impeachment investigators on Friday that a top State Department official told her that President Trump had pushed for her removal for months even though the department believed she had \u2018done nothing wrong.\u2019 In a closed-door deposition that could further fuel calls for Mr. Trump\u2019s impeachment, Ms. Yovanovitch delivered a scathing indictment of his administration\u2019s conduct of foreign policy, warning that private influence and personal gain have usurped diplomats\u2019 judgment, threatening to undermine the nation\u2019s interests and drive talented professionals out of public service. According to a copy of her opening statement obtained by The New York Times, the longtime diplomat said she was \u2018incredulous\u2019 that she was removed as ambassador \u2018based, as far as I can tell, on unfounded and false claims by people with clearly questionable motives.\u2019 A Democratic member of the House oversight committee, Eleanor Holmes Norton, said that Marie Yovanovitch was \u201cacting like a true ambassador\u201d in her closed-door interview. Norton added that the former US ambassador to Ukraine had made no mention of anyone trying to prevent her from speaking to the House committees investigating impeachment. The US is planning to send more troops, potentially numbering in the thousands, to Saudi Arabia following an attack on its oil facilities last month, which the two countries have blamed on Iran. Reuters reports: [Sources familiar with the matter] did not specify exactly how many troops would be deployed or specify whether they would be replacing any other American forces that might be departing elsewhere in the region in the coming weeks or months. The Pentagon has yet to announce, for example, whether it will replace the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and its strike group when it eventually wraps up its deployment to the Middle East. One of the sources said the United States was also considering deploying additional air defenses to Saudi Arabia. That could not be immediately confirmed, however. The Trump administration\u2019s decision to send more resources to Saudi Arabia stands in stark contrast to the president\u2019s withdrawal of troops from northern Syria. Trump said earlier this week of his Syria decision: \u201cI campaigned on the fact that I was going to bring our soldiers home, and bring them home as rapidly as possible.\u201d Ahead of his meeting this afternoon with the Chinese vice premier, Trump boasted that he would be able to unilaterally sign a trade deal with Beijing if the two countries can agree on terms. But it appears that the president is once again trying to claim credit for solving a problem of his own creation, as an LA Times editor noted. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals voted 2-1 to uphold House Democrats\u2019 subpoena for eight years of Trump\u2019s financial records from his accounting firm. The only judge to vote against upholding the subpoena was Neomi Rao, who was appointed by Trump. (The other two judges in the case were appointed by Bill Clinton and Barack Obama.) Rao argued in her dissenting opinion that members of Congress cannot investigate potentially illegal activity by the president unless it is meant to advance an impeachment inquiry, which this subpoena was not officially a part of. But a Politico reporter raised the point that Rao\u2019s argument could delegitimize nearly all congressional oversight of the president. The former US ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, is now sitting down with House committees involved in the impeachment inquiry for a \u201ctranscribed interview,\u201d according to a Fox News reporter. In case you missed it: a federal appeals court has upheld House Democrats\u2019 subpoena to obtain eight years of Trump\u2019s financial records from his accounting firm. That ruling came as Marie Yovanovitch appeared on Capitol Hill to testify in the impeachment inquiry, defying the White House\u2019s refusal to cooperate with the probe. Taken together, the developments mark two major victories for House Democrats as they seek to uncover more information about Trump and his administration for their impeachment investigation. Julian Borger also notes in his piece on Yovanovitch that her removal as ambassador to Ukraine has had a detrimental effect on state department morale: [Secretary of state Mike] Pompeo\u2019s claim that the House committees were seeking to \u2018intimidate, bully and treat improperly\u2019 state department officials has drawn accusations of hypocrisy, particularly in light of his treatment of Yovanovitch. He appears to have bowed to pressure from the White House by pulling her out of Kyiv two months before her posting was due to end, and failed to speak out in her defence when she was smeared by rightwing pundits and talkshow hosts. Pompeo likes to claim he has brought \u2018swagger\u2019 to the state department, but the treatment of Yovanovitch and the state department\u2019s embroilment in the impeachment scandal has badly hit morale at the organisation. The Guardian\u2019s world affairs editor, Julian Borger, has more on Marie Yovanovitch and how the former US ambassador to Ukraine became a central figure in the impeachment probe: Yovanovitch is no longer ambassador, having been removed in May before her posting was finished, after having been accused of disloyalty in the far-right media. ... Since leaving Kyiv, Yovanovitch has been on sabbatical at the Institute for the Study of Diplomacy at Georgetown University, but is still a serving foreign service officer. ... In picking on Yovanovitch, the detractors have chosen a tough target. She has had a stellar career, serving as ambassador under three presidents to three countries (a rare distinction), Kyrgyzstan, Armenia and Ukraine, as well as senior adviser to the under secretary of state for political affairs. ... Former colleagues all describe her as meticulous, calm under pressure, supremely qualified and steeped in the nonpartisan culture of professional diplomacy, all which set her apart from the campaign donors who are given an increasing share of ambassadorial posts. Yovanovitch\u2019s decision to testify in the impeachment inquiry could clear the way for other administration officials to speak to House committees, despite the White House\u2019s opposition. Earlier this morning, a lawyer for Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the EU, said the diplomat would cooperate with House Democrats\u2019 subpoena and talk to lawmakers next Thursday. The lawyer\u2019s statement specifically mentioned that the State Department was leaning in the direction of trying to block Sondland\u2019s testimony. So there are now two State Department officials who appear to have defied the administration\u2019s wishes to testify in the impeachment probe. It\u2019s worth taking a moment to note the boldness of Yovanovitch\u2019s decision to testify despite the White House\u2019s refusal to cooperate with the impeachment inquiry. Even though Yovanovitch was recalled from her post as the US ambassador to Ukraine this spring, she is still an employee of the State Department. Just before Yovanovitch\u2019s arrival, there was a brief moment when officers on Capitol Hill feared a security breach, adding even more drama to an already dramatic day. Marie Yovanovitch, the former US ambassador to Ukraine, has arrived on Capitol Hill to testify in the impeachment inquiry against Trump. As we await the potential arrival of Marie Yovanovitch on Capitol Hill, a federal appeals court has rejected Trump\u2019s appeal to block House Democrats\u2019 subpoena of his financial records. The D.C. Circuit court voted 2-1 to uphold the subpoena, with only Trump appointee Neomi Rao dissenting. Rao had raised concerns about the process by which the subpoena was issued, but she voted against it even after those concerns were addressed. The testimony from Marie Yovanovitch, the former US ambassador to Ukraine, was scheduled to begin a few minutes ago, but she hasn\u2019t been spotted yet on Capitol Hill. Senior congressional aides said earlier that they expected the career diplomat to appear, but it\u2019s still possible that the State Department will attempt to block her testimony. In his classic reality-television manner, Trump previewed his meeting this afternoon with the Chinese vice premier to discuss trade negotiations. US stocks jumped yesterday after Trump announced the meeting with Liu He, as investors expressed hope that the sit-down could lead the administration to ratchet down tariffs on Chinese imports. But Trump has shown no signal of wanting to call off his trade war, only predicting that China would eventually be forced to make a deal with him. Some of the House Republicans who sit on the committees leading the impeachment inquiry have arrived for Marie Yovanovitch\u2019s testimony, but it\u2019s still unclear whether the former US ambassador to Ukraine will appear. The executive editor of Lawfare and a former lawyer for the National Security Agency argued that Gordon Sondland\u2019s decision to testify could set an important precedent in the impeachment inquiry. The lawyer for Gordon Sondland, who is now expected to testify in the impeachment inquiry next Thursday, added in his statement that the US ambassador to the EU would speak to House committees despite the State Department\u2019s opposition. But he warned that the ambassador would not be able to produce many of the documents that House Democrats requested in their subpoena. Larry Hogan, the Republican governor of Maryland, expressed support for the impeachment inquiry against Trump. Hogan said in a PBS segment that aired last night: \u201cI think we do need an inquiry because we have to get to the bottom of it.\u201d But the Maryland governor made clear that, for now at least, he was only backing the investigation: \u201cI\u2019m not ready to say I support impeachment and the removal of the president, but I do think we should have an impeachment inquiry.\u201d Hogan, who has previously offered severe criticism of Trump, is now the third Republican governor to express support for the inquiry \u2013 joining Phil Scott of Vermont and Charlie Baker of Massachusetts. A lawyer for Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the EU who was blocked from testifying in the impeachment inquiry earlier this week, said he would speak to House committees next Thursday. Sondland\u2019s lawyer said in a statement that the ambassador \u201clooks forward to testifying.\u201d A person familiar with the matter told CNN that the State Department has not yet offered any guidance on Sondland\u2019s appearance. When the State Department blocked him from speaking to Congress earlier this week, Sondland said in a statement through his lawyer that he was \u201cprofoundly disappointed that he will not be able to testify.\u201d Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the EU who was blocked from testifying in the impeachment inquiry on Tuesday, is expected to speak to House committees next week after receiving a subpoena. Axios reports: One source familiar with the rescheduling tells Axios that after the State Department pulled the plug on Sondland\u2019s testimony, Republicans close to Trump encouraged the president to let the ambassador come before the committees. Trump\u2019s allies believe Sondland\u2019s testimony will be helpful to their side. \u2018Republicans are looking for any silver lining they can get,\u2019 the source said. \u2018Sondland could be a silver lining ... He donated $1 million to Trump\u2019s inaugural. He\u2019s a Trump guy. Whereas [former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie] Yovanovitch is a career person.\u2019 Good morning, live blog readers \u2013 and congratulations on making it to Friday! House committees leading the impeachment inquiry against Trump are scheduled to depose Marie Yovanovitch, the former US ambassador to Ukraine, today. The key word here is \u201cscheduled\u201d because Yovanovitch is still a State Department employee, and the department blocked another diplomat, Gordon Sondland, from testifying to the committees earlier this week. A senior congressional aide said yesterday that Yovanovitch and her lawyers were \u201con board\u201d with the interview. If she does appear, the former ambassador could provide valuable insight into reports that she pushed back against efforts from Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, to pressure Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden. Yovanovitch was recalled from her post in the spring, reportedly after Giuliani complained to Donald Trump about her opposition to the pressure campaign. So the former ambassador could answer a key question: did Trump make significant foreign-policy decisions solely to hurt the political fortunes of his potential election opponent? House Democrats are hoping to find out today. Here\u2019s what else the blog is keeping its eye on today: Trump will meet with the Chinese vice premier for trade talks and later attend a campaign rally in Louisiana. Attorney general William Barr will speak at the University of Notre Dame Law School at 4 p.m. EST. Secretary of state Mike Pompeo will address the American Association of Christian Counselors in Tennessee. The blog will be watching all of that and more, so stay tuned.",

      "bodyText": "US troops deployed near the city of Kobani in northern Syria came under artillery fire from Turkish positions, the Pentagon said on Friday evening. The explosion occurred near a military outpost in northern Syria and in an area known by the Turks to have US forces present, Navy Capt Brook DeWalt said in a statement. All US troops are accounted for, but the incident highlights the risks to US troops as Turkey wages an offensive in the region. Turkey\u2019s defense ministry said it had taken all measures to ensure that no US base was damaged while it responded to harassment fire that originated near the base. Earlier on Friday, the US defense secretary said Turkey\u2019s \u201cimpulsive\u201d decision to invade northern Syria would further destabilize a region already caught up in civil war. Mark Esper told a news briefing that the withdrawal of US troops from the border did not mean America has abandoned its Syrian Kurdish allies. Donald Trump\u2019s decision to pull back troops from the Syrian border region has been widely criticized as a tacit \u201cgreen light\u201d for a Turkish offensive that intensified on Friday, with air and artillery strikes on Kurdish militia. \u201cNobody green-lighted this operation by Turkey, just the opposite. We pushed back very hard at all levels for the Turks not to commence this operation,\u201d Esper said. Even some of Trump\u2019s staunchest Republican supporters have sharply criticized the decision, which some regard it as a betrayal of the US-armed Kurdish fighters who partnered with US forces against the Islamic State, at great cost. Esper insisted the Kurds remain a viable partner. \u201cTo be clear, we are not abandoning our Kurdish partner forces, and US troops remain with them in other parts of Syria. The impulsive action of President [Recep Tayyip] Erdo\u011fan to invade northern Syria has put the United States in a tough situation,\u201d Esper said. The Turkish invasion also has raised the prospect of losing control of thousands of captured Islamic State fighters. Esper called on the Turks to halt their operation, but told reporters that he has no indication they are willing to do so. He lamented \u201cthe dramatic harm\u201d done to the two nations\u2019 relationship. Speaking alongside Esper, Gen Mark Milley said the US-backed Syrian Kurdish military known as the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), is still guarding camps holding Isis prisoners. Milley, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, said the Turkish military operations across the border into Syria were still \u201crelatively limited\u201d. He said the operations have been carried out near two Syrian villages by about 1,000 members of the Turkish-backed Free Syrian Army and hundreds of Turkish commando forces. The distance they have penetrated into Syria ranges from a kilometer or two (about 1 mile) in one area to about 10km (6.2 miles) in another. Milley emphasized that US forces are still working with Kurdish forces. He said US policy is to continue with a counter-Isis campaign except in one area of the incursion. He said the Turks \u201cknow exactly where American forces are\u201d throughout Syria and in the invasion zone. They have been told that US troops will defend themselves if needed, he said. Milley said leaders of the Kurdish force have told some of their fighters to move north to defend what they consider to be their territory. But he said the US is \u201cencouraging them to not overreact at this point and to try to tamp things down in order to allow some sort of diplomatic resolution\u201d.",
