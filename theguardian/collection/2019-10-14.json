Ethical lobbying is a valuable and important element of a healthy democracy. It helps those who have a stake in government policy to convey their views and expertise. There are two broad types of lobbyists: third-party lobbyists, who are engaged as consultants; in-house lobbyists, who work directly for corporations or interest groups.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Who hires lobbyists? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>For many Australians, lobbying conjures images of powerful corporations working to sway politicians behind the scenes. There is a truth in that. The big banks, mining and energy giants, pharmaceutical companies, casinos, Amazon, Google and Facebook all engage lobbyists. But lobbyists also work on behalf of not-for-profits and community groups, including for veterans, social workers, aged-care staff, school principals and environmental organisations.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the lobbyist register? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The lobbyist register is the public's only window into the world of lobbying. It's a publicly available online list of lobbying firms, individual lobbyists and their clients. The register was a huge step forward when it was introduced in 2008, but remains frustratingly opaque. It doesn't tell us who is lobbying whom, about what, or when. Compare that with the ACT, where lobbyists are required to file quarterly reports on their activities, or NSW, where ministers are required to publish their diaries. The federal register is also completely blind to the activities of in-house lobbyists.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the lobbyist code of conduct?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The code tells lobbyists how they must behave when approaching the government and is designed to maintain ethical standards. But the code is not legislated and has no real teeth. It goes largely unenforced and the punishments are weak. The worst sanction available to authorities is removing a lobbyist from the register. The US and Canada have fines or jail terms for law breaches.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Who keeps an eye on lobbyists? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Federally it's the prime minister's&nbsp; department that loosely oversees lobbying. It takes on a largely administrative role, rather than an investigative or regulatory one. Its core job is to maintain the register and communicate the code's requirements to lobbyists. It lacks independence, relies on reports of bad lobbying and rarely, if ever, takes enforcement action.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Saber has won multiple contracts with the defence department in the past 12 months, including a $2.1m project to provide \u201cintelligent data fusion services\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.tenders.gov.au/Cn/Show/571ed15b-fb8d-4bca-b7b9-bb0cfac7f32d\">awarded in July</a>.</p> \n<p>It was also earlier awarded $1.2m from the government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.business.gov.au/centre-for-defence-industry-capability/defence-innovation/defence-innovation-hub\">defence innovation hub</a> investment program to continue developing \u201cmachine learning technology for autonomous identification and modelling of electronic threats\u201d.</p> \n<p>Pyne issued<a href=\"https://www.minister.defence.gov.au/minister/christopher-pyne/media-releases/defence-innovation-hub-awards-latest-tranche-contracts\"> a media release</a> as defence minister announcing the $1.2m for Saber in July 2018, less than 18 months ago.</p> \n<p>There is no suggestion the funding was awarded improperly.

Instead, despite being told repeatedly by the prize\u2019s literary director, Gaby Wood, that they were not allowed to split the \u00a350,000 award, they chose two novels: Atwood\u2019s The Testaments, a follow-up to her dystopian The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, and Evaristo\u2019s Girl, Woman, Other, which is told in the voices of 12 different characters, mostly black women.</p> \n<p>Evaristo\u2019s win makes her the first black woman to win the Booker since it began in 1969 and the first black British author. At 79, Atwood becomes the prize\u2019s oldest winner.

I really would have been embarrassed, trust me on that.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not the jury. I have been on a jury that split the prize and I understand the predicament. I get it ... they should have split it 13 ways but unfortunately that\u2019s not how it goes.\u201d</p> \n<p>Evaristo said: \u201cI\u2019m just so delighted to have won the prize. Yes, I am sharing it with an amazing writer. But I am not thinking about sharing it, I am thinking about the fact that I am here and that\u2019s an incredible thing considering what the prize has meant to me and my literary life, and the fact that it felt so unattainable for decades.\u201d</p> \n<p>At a press conference, Evaristo was asked if she would have preferred to win the full \u00a350,000. She said: \u201cWhat do you think? Yes but I\u2019m happy to share it. That\u2019s the kind of person I am.\u201d</p> \n<p>Evaristo said she would put it towards her mortgage; Atwood said she was \u201ctoo old\u201d and had \u201ctoo many handbags\u201d to spend it on herself. She said her \u00a325,000 would be donated to the Canadian Indigenous charity Indspire, one she has previously helped with her late friend and First Nations leader Chief Harry St Denis.</p> \n<p>When asked about the recent death of her longtime partner, the Canadian author Graeme Gibson, Atwood responded: \u201cDo you think that is in good taste? It is the best of times and it is the worst of times. If you\u2019re really wondering what I am doing here, it is much better for me to be on the road right now, surrounded by lots of people and talking about other things.\u201d</p> \n<p>Florence revealed the jury has been put under pressure to have one winner. \u201cOur consensus was that it was our decision to flout the rules and divide this year\u2019s prize to celebrate two winners,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are two books we started not wanting to give up and the more we talked about them the more we treasured both of them and wanted them both as winners \u2026 We couldn\u2019t separate them.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Booker prize has been split twice before: in 1974, by Nadine Gordimer and Stanley Middleton, and in 1992, by Michael Ondaatje and Barry Unsworth. After 1992, the rules were changed to insist that the prize \u201cmay not be divided or withheld\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"9f572ff58d96a158bfd664b3f73a36e76fd14f64\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f572ff58d96a158bfd664b3f73a36e76fd14f64/0_0_1666_2560/651.jpg\" alt=\"The Testaments by Margaret Atwood.\" width=\"651\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Testaments by Margaret Atwood.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: handout</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cWe tried voting, that didn\u2019t work,\u201d said Florence. \u201cThere\u2019s a metaphor for our times.\u201d</p> \n<p>After more than three hours of discussions, the jury asked Wood if they could split the prize. They were told no. They went back into discussions for another hour, to come up with the same, unanimous choice. Wood spoke to the chair of trustees, Helena Kennedy, who also insisted on the rules being kept. The jury came back a third time, announcing with what Florence said was \u201cabsolute consensus\u201d, that they had decided to ignore the rules.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe spent a good hour and a half agonising over how to resolve the issue to the jurors\u2019 satisfaction, and the eventual decision that was taken was a moment of joy for all of us,\u201d said Florence. \u201cWe were trying to accommodate the rules that were given to us.

      "bodyText": "The judges of this year\u2019s Booker prize have \u201cexplicitly flouted\u201d the rules of the august literary award to choose the first joint winners in almost 30 years: Margaret Atwood and Bernardine Evaristo. The chair of judges, Peter Florence, emerged after more than five hours with the jury to reveal that the group of five had been unable to pick a single winner from their shortlist of six. Instead, despite being told repeatedly by the prize\u2019s literary director, Gaby Wood, that they were not allowed to split the \u00a350,000 award, they chose two novels: Atwood\u2019s The Testaments, a follow-up to her dystopian The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, and Evaristo\u2019s Girl, Woman, Other, which is told in the voices of 12 different characters, mostly black women. Evaristo\u2019s win makes her the first black woman to win the Booker since it began in 1969 and the first black British author. At 79, Atwood becomes the prize\u2019s oldest winner. The Canadian author previously won the Booker in 2000 for The Blind Assassin; she becomes the fourth author to have won the prize twice. Atwood said after the ceremony at London\u2019s Guildhall: \u201cIt would have been quite embarrassing for a person of my age and stage to have won the whole thing and thereby hinder a person in an earlier stage of their career from going through that door. I really would have been embarrassed, trust me on that. \u201cI\u2019m not the jury. I have been on a jury that split the prize and I understand the predicament. I get it ... they should have split it 13 ways but unfortunately that\u2019s not how it goes.\u201d Evaristo said: \u201cI\u2019m just so delighted to have won the prize. Yes, I am sharing it with an amazing writer. But I am not thinking about sharing it, I am thinking about the fact that I am here and that\u2019s an incredible thing considering what the prize has meant to me and my literary life, and the fact that it felt so unattainable for decades.\u201d At a press conference, Evaristo was asked if she would have preferred to win the full \u00a350,000. She said: \u201cWhat do you think? Yes but I\u2019m happy to share it. That\u2019s the kind of person I am.\u201d Evaristo said she would put it towards her mortgage; Atwood said she was \u201ctoo old\u201d and had \u201ctoo many handbags\u201d to spend it on herself. She said her \u00a325,000 would be donated to the Canadian Indigenous charity Indspire, one she has previously helped with her late friend and First Nations leader Chief Harry St Denis. When asked about the recent death of her longtime partner, the Canadian author Graeme Gibson, Atwood responded: \u201cDo you think that is in good taste? It is the best of times and it is the worst of times. If you\u2019re really wondering what I am doing here, it is much better for me to be on the road right now, surrounded by lots of people and talking about other things.\u201d Florence revealed the jury has been put under pressure to have one winner. \u201cOur consensus was that it was our decision to flout the rules and divide this year\u2019s prize to celebrate two winners,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are two books we started not wanting to give up and the more we talked about them the more we treasured both of them and wanted them both as winners \u2026 We couldn\u2019t separate them.\u201d The Booker prize has been split twice before: in 1974, by Nadine Gordimer and Stanley Middleton, and in 1992, by Michael Ondaatje and Barry Unsworth. After 1992, the rules were changed to insist that the prize \u201cmay not be divided or withheld\u201d. \u201cWe tried voting, that didn\u2019t work,\u201d said Florence. \u201cThere\u2019s a metaphor for our times.\u201d After more than three hours of discussions, the jury asked Wood if they could split the prize. They were told no. They went back into discussions for another hour, to come up with the same, unanimous choice. Wood spoke to the chair of trustees, Helena Kennedy, who also insisted on the rules being kept. The jury came back a third time, announcing with what Florence said was \u201cabsolute consensus\u201d, that they had decided to ignore the rules. \u201cWe spent a good hour and a half agonising over how to resolve the issue to the jurors\u2019 satisfaction, and the eventual decision that was taken was a moment of joy for all of us,\u201d said Florence. \u201cWe were trying to accommodate the rules that were given to us. How do you equably and fairly resolve something that seems irresolvable? You find a way of changing the game.\u201d Asked if she supported the decision, Wood said: \u201cIt is an explicit flouting of the rules and they all understood that. It was a rebellious gesture but it was \u2026 a generous one.\u201d She made clear that the rules would not be changed in future \u2013 and that this year\u2019s jury was not the first to ask to split the prize. Florence said: \u201cI hope both winning authors will accept this as a mark of respect to two books.\u201d The chair of judges, who was joined on the judging panel by Liz Calder, Xiaolu Guo, Afua Hirsch and Joanna MacGregor, said that The Testaments and Girl, Woman, Other were \u201cfully engaged novels, they are both linguistically inventive, they are adventurous in all kinds of ways. They address the world today and give us insights into it and create characters who resonate with us, and will resonate with us for ages\u201d. Evaristo\u2019s novel, he said, was \u201cgroundbreaking\u201d, with \u201csomething utterly magnificent about the full cast of characters\u201d; the novelist set out to write in a polyphonic series of voices as a \u201cstrategy against invisibility\u201d, because \u201cwe black British women know that if we don\u2019t write ourselves into literature, no one else will\u201d.

      "body": "<p>Pupils in England are being propelled out of schools and into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/homeschooling\">home education</a>, sometimes in the space of a single day, with little or no discussion beforehand and often without consulting the child, according a report by the schools watchdog.</p> <p>In some cases pupils are moved so quickly they are not even able to say goodbye to their friends. In other cases, parents complained that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/schools\">schools</a> refused to allow children who were leaving to be educated at home to take their schoolwork with them.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/ofsted\">Ofsted</a> report, which focuses on schools and families in seven local authorities in the east Midlands, attempts to shed light on the recent surge in the number of children leaving school for \u201celective\u201d home education.</p> <p>In all the cases that formed part of Ofsted\u2019s research, there had been a breakdown in the relationship between parents and schools and many families were left with the view that home education was the only option for their child.</p> <p>The children affected are often those with complex <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/specialeducationneeds\">special needs</a>, which many schools are no longer able to meet because of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/school-funding\">budget cuts</a>. The report also looks at the issue of \u201coff-rolling\u201d, where children are unofficially removed from school rolls to boost results.</p> <p>\u201cUnfortunately, our evidence suggests that letting children go can be an easy option for schools,\u201d the report says. \u201cWe cannot say for certain whether there were any cases of off-rolling. Our research did find examples that support other evidence that parents have been coerced into moving to home education.</p> <p>\u201cFor example, one local authority had previously received letters from parents asking to move a child to home education that were written on school-headed paper but signed by parents.\u201d</p> <p>The report finds evidence that some parents are choosing home education to avoid prosecution for non-attendance and permanent exclusion, often the result of a child\u2019s needs not being met at school. \u201cI have been forced into doing it because there was no other option,\u201d one parent told Ofsted. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t, I\u2019d end up with a fine or prison.\u201d</p> <p>Far from being a positive choice, home education is usually a last resort for parents who are often unprepared and ill-equipped to provide their children with a suitable education, according to the report. Ofsted said home education was \u201ca huge undertaking\u201d for parents, who frequently complained of a lack of support.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no help, not even paper,\u201d one parent told inspectors. \u201cI\u2019ve not got the experience or funds for home schooling and I\u2019ve made that clear to the authorities. So my daughter is receiving nothing at all,\u201d said another.</p> <p>According to <a href=\"https://adcs.org.uk/education/article/elective-home-education-survey-2018\">figures from the Association of Directors of Children\u2019s Services</a>, the number of children in home education is increasing rapidly, rising to just under 58,000 last autumn, which was up 27% on the previous year. The greatest increase has been among children studying for GCSEs, fuelling fears that some schools may be gaming the system.</p> <p>The report expresses concern about the speed at which decisions to home educate are made and the lack of planning to support such a dramatic change in a child\u2019s life. \u201cIn extreme circumstances, moving a child to home education took as little as a day,\u201d the report says. \u201cFor example, after one parent heard about the possibility of home education, their child said: \u2018Mum took me out of school the next day.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The Ofsted chief inspector, Amanda Spielman, said home education was a legitimate parental choice and could be positive for a child where parents are well-equipped to provide a good education.</p> <p>\u201cHowever, children should not be moved to home education simply to resolve difficulties in school,\u201d she said. \u201cSchools, local authorities and parents need to work together before such a decision is made, to make sure that home education is genuinely in the interests of children and not just the best thing for schools or parents.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s vital that parents are fully informed about the alternatives, and that they understand all the implications and costs of home educating their child.\u201d</p> <p>Tim Nicholls, the head of policy at the National Autistic Society, said the Ofsted research showed that many parents were home schooling their children because their schools were not giving them they support they needed. \u201cThis is really alarming, particularly as schools have a legal duty to make reasonable adjustments for children on the autism spectrum. Home schooling should be a choice but for many there\u2019s simply no other option.\u201d</p> <p>Julie McCulloch, the director of policy at the Association of School and College Leaders, said: \u201cSchool leaders work tirelessly with young people and their parents to ensure they receive a high-quality education, and to support children who are having difficulties at school.</p> <p>\u201cHowever, cuts both to school budgets and to wider support services make it increasingly difficult for schools to provide the high-level support that some children need, which can lead to frustration and friction between schools and families.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Pupils in England are being propelled out of schools and into home education, sometimes in the space of a single day, with little or no discussion beforehand and often without consulting the child, according a report by the schools watchdog. In some cases pupils are moved so quickly they are not even able to say goodbye to their friends. In other cases, parents complained that schools refused to allow children who were leaving to be educated at home to take their schoolwork with them. The Ofsted report, which focuses on schools and families in seven local authorities in the east Midlands, attempts to shed light on the recent surge in the number of children leaving school for \u201celective\u201d home education. In all the cases that formed part of Ofsted\u2019s research, there had been a breakdown in the relationship between parents and schools and many families were left with the view that home education was the only option for their child. The children affected are often those with complex special needs, which many schools are no longer able to meet because of budget cuts. The report also looks at the issue of \u201coff-rolling\u201d, where children are unofficially removed from school rolls to boost results. \u201cUnfortunately, our evidence suggests that letting children go can be an easy option for schools,\u201d the report says. \u201cWe cannot say for certain whether there were any cases of off-rolling. Our research did find examples that support other evidence that parents have been coerced into moving to home education. \u201cFor example, one local authority had previously received letters from parents asking to move a child to home education that were written on school-headed paper but signed by parents.\u201d The report finds evidence that some parents are choosing home education to avoid prosecution for non-attendance and permanent exclusion, often the result of a child\u2019s needs not being met at school. \u201cI have been forced into doing it because there was no other option,\u201d one parent told Ofsted. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t, I\u2019d end up with a fine or prison.\u201d Far from being a positive choice, home education is usually a last resort for parents who are often unprepared and ill-equipped to provide their children with a suitable education, according to the report. Ofsted said home education was \u201ca huge undertaking\u201d for parents, who frequently complained of a lack of support. \u201cThere\u2019s no help, not even paper,\u201d one parent told inspectors. \u201cI\u2019ve not got the experience or funds for home schooling and I\u2019ve made that clear to the authorities. So my daughter is receiving nothing at all,\u201d said another. According to figures from the Association of Directors of Children\u2019s Services, the number of children in home education is increasing rapidly, rising to just under 58,000 last autumn, which was up 27% on the previous year. The greatest increase has been among children studying for GCSEs, fuelling fears that some schools may be gaming the system. The report expresses concern about the speed at which decisions to home educate are made and the lack of planning to support such a dramatic change in a child\u2019s life. \u201cIn extreme circumstances, moving a child to home education took as little as a day,\u201d the report says. \u201cFor example, after one parent heard about the possibility of home education, their child said: \u2018Mum took me out of school the next day.\u2019\u201d The Ofsted chief inspector, Amanda Spielman, said home education was a legitimate parental choice and could be positive for a child where parents are well-equipped to provide a good education. \u201cHowever, children should not be moved to home education simply to resolve difficulties in school,\u201d she said. \u201cSchools, local authorities and parents need to work together before such a decision is made, to make sure that home education is genuinely in the interests of children and not just the best thing for schools or parents. \u201cIt\u2019s vital that parents are fully informed about the alternatives, and that they understand all the implications and costs of home educating their child.\u201d Tim Nicholls, the head of policy at the National Autistic Society, said the Ofsted research showed that many parents were home schooling their children because their schools were not giving them they support they needed. \u201cThis is really alarming, particularly as schools have a legal duty to make reasonable adjustments for children on the autism spectrum. Home schooling should be a choice but for many there\u2019s simply no other option.\u201d Julie McCulloch, the director of policy at the Association of School and College Leaders, said: \u201cSchool leaders work tirelessly with young people and their parents to ensure they receive a high-quality education, and to support children who are having difficulties at school. \u201cHowever, cuts both to school budgets and to wider support services make it increasingly difficult for schools to provide the high-level support that some children need, which can lead to frustration and friction between schools and families.\u201d",

Howard Rees, an XR spokesman who was at the scene, told the Guardian that police started clearing Trafalgar Square before even issuing the revised order to protesters. \u201cThey gave us the notification: \u2018We have started clearing the square\u2019,\u201d Rees said. \u201cIt\u2019s all peaceful. People for the most part are being given the opportunity to move their possessions. But obviously there are a lot of people who have had stuff here who are not actually on site, hence the marquees are full of people\u2019s gear and other people are trying to get it to safety. The police are for the most part watching over that operation.\u201d On Twitter, the London branch of XR wrote: \u201cPolice are clearing peaceful protest in Trafalgar &amp; Vauxhall. They are back-tracking on promises made &amp;, MEPs say, in contravention of UK law, in the national square. This is an emergency, and an outrage. The police must respect the law. This is a democracy.\u201d Kevin Blowe, the coordinator of the Network for Police Monitoring (Netpol), said the order effectively amounted to a ban on XR without going through the due process that would usually be required. \u201cA ban has to be made by the home secretary,\u201d he said. \u201cOur reading of it is that the section 14 powers are supposed to be used with caution because people still have a right to protest and potentially this is unlawful, and there is no other way to put it. Take a look at what section 14 says: it\u2019s about restricting a number of people for a particular duration of time. My feeling is that this has to be open to some form of potential legal challenge.\u201d Scotland Yard said activists were told to cease their protests by 9pm on Monday or face arrest. Deputy assistant commissioner Laurence Taylor said: \u201cThese conditions have been imposed due to the continued breaches of the section 14 condition previously implemented and ongoing serious disruption to the community. \u201cWe have made significant progress in managing Extinction Rebellion\u2019s activity at sites across central London over this past week. Officers have begun the process of clearing Trafalgar Square and getting things back to normal.\u201d A few XR activists locked themselves in place to slow the police operation, Rees said. Specialist police teams were working to cut them free and arrest them. It was unlikely that protesters at Trafalgar Square and their equipment would be taken to the alternative camp in Vauxhall, because that site was considered to be full and its security was uncertain as it remained subject to the section 14, Rees said. He added: \u201cThe concern would now be that essentially the police have gone back on their word about us being allowed to stay here, so will Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens be next?\u201d It came after a day in which scores of protesters were arrested for blocking traffic outside the Bank of England, including a 77-year-old rabbi who was dragged away by officers after refusing to comply with a police order to leave the area. Hundreds of demonstrators walked into the road outside the Bank of England in the City and sat down early on Monday morning. The group said: \u201cExtinction Rebellion this morning are disrupting the system bankrolling the environmental crisis. The day of disruption, which will target financial institutions, seeks to highlight the far greater disruption faced by those living in the environments systematically being destroyed by UK-backed companies. \u201cThe ecological damage is global and it is hitting the global south now.\u201d Protesters said they were switching their focus to the financial institutions \u201cfunding environmental destruction\u201d.",

Among the proposals set out in the Queen\u2019s speech on Monday were \u201csteps to protect the integrity of democracy and the electoral system in the United Kingdom\u201d. Johnson\u2019s spokesman confirmed the government\u2019s intention to introduce a requirement for voters to present photo identification, a move that was condemned by many Labour MPs. The former Labour leader Ed Miliband called the move \u201cvoter suppression\u201d and Labour\u2019s Angela Eagle raised the issue in the House of Commons as MPs debated the Queen\u2019s speech, calling it \u201can attempt by the Conservative party to suppress voting, and is designed deliberately to hit the poorest hardest\u201d. Corbyn pointed out that 11 million people in the UK did not have any form of photo ID, such as a passport or driving licence. Speaking on Monday night before a visit to the Black Cultural Archives in Brixton, south London, the Labour leader said: \u201cThese plans are clearly discriminatory and a blatant attempt by the Tories to suppress voters, deny people their democratic rights and rig the result of the next general election. \u201cThe people that the Tories are trying to stop voting will be disproportionately from ethnic minority backgrounds and they will disproportionately be working class voters of all ethnicities. The prime minister\u2019s official spokesman gave a robust defence of the proposals, however, insisting: \u201cInternational election observers have repeatedly called for the introduction of ID in polling stations in Great Britain, saying its absence is a security risk.\u201d He was referring to recommendations by the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE); its analysis of the 2010 and 2015 general elections suggested the government should give \u201cserious consideration\u201d to introducing \u201ca more robust mechanism for identification of voters\u201d. The watchdog did not specifically call for photo ID, however. \u201cExisting national and local government-issued cards could be considered for this purpose and voters could be obligated to sign the voters\u2019 list before being issued a ballot paper,\u201d it said. Analysis by the Electoral Commission found that there was just one conviction for voter personation \u2013 the offence photo ID would be aiming to prevent \u2013 in 2017. After observing the 2017 general election, the OSCE made five recommendations, none of which concerned the need for voters to prove their identity. The main one called for \u201cannual limits on the amount a single permissible donor may contribute to a political party or a candidate, in order to prevent undue influence of large contributors\u201d. The Conservative party chair, James Cleverly, accused Corbyn of \u201csowing the seeds of division\u201d, adding: \u201cIf anything, tougher checks against electoral fraud will protect the democratic rights of all communities.\u201d",

We heard some sounds which sounded like monkey chants. We had a pre-agreement with Gareth that I would come down if the game was interrupted. I heard some more chants and saw some activity which was <em>appalling</em>. I wouldn\u2019t want to describe it but it was appalling, and I had a chat with Gareth at half-time.</p> <p>\u201cWe were told by the officials that 500 people in the corner who caused a lot of touble has been thrown out at half-time. They said that after that there were isolated examples of racist behaviour, not massed examples, and the protocol deals with massed examples of racist behaviour. They\u2019ll have to collect more information from live footage of the game.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m happy that Gareth was in control from our side. He got the players together when the first incident happened. Then, when the second incident happened the referee said, \u2018Do you want to carry on?\u2019 He said, \u2018There are only four minutes to half-time, let\u2019s get to the break and review it.\u2019 He sat down with the players; they wanted to get out there and play. And I <em>think</em> \u2013 and this is only my opinion \u2013 there was less racism and chanting in the second half. Any of it is appalling. I spoke to Gareth at the end and he felt they made the right decision to end the game.</p> <p>\u201cI would like to see a very stringent review by Uefa. I know they take racism very, very seriously. If we say we\u2019ve got zero tolerance for racism, then one person making money chants is the same as a hundred. To be perfectly frank, we also need to address racism in England. We have it throughout the pyramid. We shouldn\u2019t take the moral high ground; we should join a movement to drive it out of the game. </p> <p>\u201cUefa are going to have to think very carefully about the level of abuse they are willing to let players tolerate, and they are going to have to make an example of somebody one day.

Shall we try that one again? England were supposed to clinch their place at Euro 2020 in the Czech Republic on Friday night; instead they suffered a defeat that was somewhere between irritating and alarming. It won\u2019t affect their eventual qualification, but it has altered expectations of what they might achieve next summer. The Three Lionsometer, with <strong>It\u2019s Coming Home!</strong> at one end and <strong>Send Them Home!</strong> at the other, has plenty of zinging to do before the tournament begins next June.</p> <p>England have defended shoddily in the last two matches, and something hasn\u2019t quite felt right. We can\u2019t say it\u2019s inertia, because Gareth Southgate has changed the personnel and tactics since the World Cup. Tonight, Matthew, he may revert to the back three that served England pretty well in Russia.</p> <p>Their opponents, Bulgaria, are not the biggest threat. Their last victory was a year ago yesterday, at home to Cyprus, and there are no modern equivalents of Hristo Stoichkov or Georgi Asparuhov in their side. There\u2019s barely a modern equivalent of Boncho Genchev. Bulgaria\u2019s best player is probably Dimitar Berbatov, and he retired from all football last month.</p> <p>England will officially qualify for Euro 2020 if they win and Kosovo fail to win at home to Montenegro. But they know qualification is ahappenin, if not this month then next. It doesn\u2019t matter what happens in Kosovo. What England really want tonight is a win, a clean sheet and no sightings of the Keystone Cops.</p> <p><strong>Kick off</strong> is at 7.45pm.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-14T17:16:08.642Z\">at 6.16pm BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s it for tonight\u2019s blog. An unpleasant night, no doubt, but hopefully a seismic one. After decades of lip service and painfully slow change, a precedent was set when the game was stopped twice and almost abandoned. Thanks for your company and emails, goodnight. And here\u2019s Gareth Southgate \u201cI have to say that the Uefa officials were onto everything very quickly. We reported everything immediately when we heard things; we had constant communication with the fourth official and the referee. I was in contact with the players all the way through the first half in particular, and then again at half-time. \u201cWe know it\u2019s an unacceptable situation. I think we\u2019ve managed to make two statements \u2013 by winning the game, and by raising awareness of the situation. The game was stopped twice. I know for some people that won\u2019t be enough, but as a group we were on board with that process.\u201d Here\u2019s Tyrone Mings \u201cIt was a great occasion; I made my England debut. Slightly overshadowed by a few disappointing chants, which could be clearly heard on the pitch, but we showed a great response and ultimately we let the football do the talking. \u201cI think the protocol was effective, and there was less chanting after that. We made a decision at half-time to come out and play the game, which we thought was the right thing to do.\u201d We\u2019ll have plenty of reaction to the match as the evening progresses. For now, here\u2019s our chief football correspondent David Hytner\u2019s report. Greg Clarke, the FA chairman, is speaking on ITV \u201cI was up in the stands with some of the FA staff. We heard some sounds which sounded like monkey chants. We had a pre-agreement with Gareth that I would come down if the game was interrupted. I heard some more chants and saw some activity which was appalling. I wouldn\u2019t want to describe it but it was appalling, and I had a chat with Gareth at half-time. \u201cWe were told by the officials that 500 people in the corner who caused a lot of touble has been thrown out at half-time. They said that after that there were isolated examples of racist behaviour, not massed examples, and the protocol deals with massed examples of racist behaviour. They\u2019ll have to collect more information from live footage of the game. \u201cI\u2019m happy that Gareth was in control from our side. He got the players together when the first incident happened. Then, when the second incident happened the referee said, \u2018Do you want to carry on?\u2019 He said, \u2018There are only four minutes to half-time, let\u2019s get to the break and review it.\u2019 He sat down with the players; they wanted to get out there and play. And I think \u2013 and this is only my opinion \u2013 there was less racism and chanting in the second half. Any of it is appalling. I spoke to Gareth at the end and he felt they made the right decision to end the game. \u201cI would like to see a very stringent review by Uefa. I know they take racism very, very seriously. If we say we\u2019ve got zero tolerance for racism, then one person making money chants is the same as a hundred. To be perfectly frank, we also need to address racism in England. We have it throughout the pyramid. We shouldn\u2019t take the moral high ground; we should join a movement to drive it out of the game. \u201cUefa are going to have to think very carefully about the level of abuse they are willing to let players tolerate, and they are going to have to make an example of somebody one day. We have to be so proud of our team and our backroom staff, who stood shoulder to shoulder in the face of abject racism and showed they were stronger than racism.\u201d \u201cI admire the determination of English footballers to fight racism, but racism happens here in the UK too,\u201d says Jose Rodriguez. \u201cI am a Spanish citizen living and working in the UK for a number of years, and recently my neighbour next door told me I should show some respect as I come to this country to work. So I am a second-class citizen. Why not British look inside too before erecting themselves as the savours of the world...\u201d I honestly don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case. Racism is still a huge problem in Britain; everyone knows that. ITV have just shown footage of Raheem Sterling being abused throughout the second half. I can understand the reluctance to call the game off, but it probably should have been in accordance with the protocol. It sounds like Uefa only got involved if an England player complained, which isn\u2019t great. Ian Wright, speaking on ITV, says this is a \u201cfantastic moment, a seminal moment ... what\u2019s good about it is that this is a generation of players and people now - not just black players - who won\u2019t tolerate this any more. My generation was a generation of turn the other cheek, Martin Luther King. This is the by-any-means-necessary generation; the Malcolm X generation. They don\u2019t need to take it any more. I feel really good watching this. I played so many games like this where people said, \u2018Just beat them on the pitch.\u2019 It doesn\u2019t do anything. Today, they\u2019ve won.\u201d Callum Wilson hits the post with the last kick of the match. The final whistle is greeted by loud boos. But at least we heard the final whistle, which seemed unlikely when the game was halted twice in the first half because of racist abuse. 90 min Two minutes of added time. Sancho almost makes it 7-0 with a low shot that is saved by Iliev. He was played in by a terrific pass from Callum Wilson. 87 min \u201cWould you say that having Maddison in the hole behind Kane, Rashford, and Sterling is a bit of a gamble?\u201d harhars Matt Gray. 86 min Mount\u2019s long-range shot is beaten away by Iliev. England could have scored 10 tonight. Moments earlier, Zanev plunged his stats into the back of Sancho\u2019s leg. He should have been sent off for that. Harry Kane makes a goal for ... Harry Kane, just as Ben Culling predicted a few minutes ago. Kane slipped the ball through the legs of the last man Terziev, ran through and sidefooted the ball past Iliev. 84 min \u201cEngland game halted ... and continued,\u201d says Stephen Morris. \u201cBut never let reality get in the way of a headline.\u201d Thank goodness someone has finally had the courage to highlight the big issue of the night. 83 min Kane drives a low shot off the outside of the post. 82 min \u201cUnfortunately our number 9 is also our best number 10,\u201d says Ben Culling. \u201cThe only way Kane will score tonight is by passing to himself. If it was the nineties you\u2019d pair Kane with a whippet like Rashford and they\u2019d be a whole heap of fun.\u201d His evolution as a player, for richer and poorer, is really interesting. I\u2019d love to see him in the same team as Maddison, with Sterling and Rashford as wide forwards. 78 min It looks like game is going to finish, which looked very unlikely at half-time. 77 min Thanks for all your emails, most of which I haven\u2019t had chance to read yet. In the strangest possible way, this is the kind of match you can\u2019t take your eyes off. 76 min Marcus Rashford, who scored the opening goal and played well in what has become his best position on the left, is replaced by Callum Wilson. Bulgaria bring on Kristiyan Malinov for Wanderson. 75 min \u201cI\u2019ve noticed that a lot of the commentary and punditry around the issue of racism in football and stadiums focuses on the idea of \u2018bad individuals\u2019 and \u2018rotten eggs\u2019,\u201d says Mukseet Bashir. \u201cAnd while that\u2019s true, the reality is that these people are a reflection of a society that emboldens and enables them to exist. It\u2019s important to deal to these issues (whether that be walking off, or abandoning games, or whatever the solution might be), I think it\u2019s important to acknowledge that these issues don\u2019t exist in a vacuum; they\u2019re simply a visceral and confronting reflection of broader systemic racism. Unless we as a society work to improve the systemic and historic issues around race, this kind of bigotry will always exist.\u201d Yes, that\u2019s a fair point. And I suppose there are plenty of precedents to show what can be achieved over time. I do think things are improving, however slowly. Had this happened a decade ago, I doubt anything would have been said until after the game. Then again, some of the most important people in the world are racists who don\u2019t even realise they\u2019re racist, which must be doing untold damage. 73 min A double change for England: Mason Mount and Jadon Sancho replace Ross Barkley and the inspirational Raheem Sterling. England score five goals for the fourth time in their Euro 2020 qualification campaign. Kane slides a nice pass through to Sterling, who finishes with precision. Harry Kane\u2019s through passing, both tonight and against the Czech Republic, has been devastating. 69 min A Bulgaria change: Isa off, Ivanov on. 67 min \u201cThis is surreal, in the worst possible way,\u201d says Guy Hornsby. \u201cWhile it\u2019s good to see this called out and exposed so clearly, in prime time, it\u2019s still staggering to actually see unfold. I remember the 80s, and I\u2019ve heard some awful stuff in grounds, but this is another level. Hardly seems real to have it so visible. You have to admire these guys for even being able to string a few passes together. I can\u2019t even imagine. The football just seems like a strange footnote.\u201d It\u2019s despicable, but let\u2019s be honest \u2013 it was even worse in the 1970s and 1980s. Ian Wright did a brilliant documentary on ITV4 last year, Out of Their Skin, which is worth watching if you can find it. And Dave Hill\u2019s book on John Barnes, Out of His Skin, is even more startling. 63 min Iliev saves from Kane\u2019s close-range strike. England could have doubled their 4-0 half-time lead. 62 min Clive Tyldesley, the ITV commentator, reports that there has been more racist abuse since half-time, and some Uefa officials have convened on the touchline. 61 min \u201cAbandoning the game achieves nothing,\u201d says John Potter. \u201cThe idiots almost get what they want, and move in somewhere else. And what about the fans of the non-abusive team. A trip across Europe for half a game. Never gonna work.\u201d I agree it\u2019s not ideal, but I can\u2019t think of any better ideas. 60 min Zanev\u2019s low long-range shot is well claimed by the unsighted Pickford. 60 min Maguire fouls Isa, who briefly looks interested in continuing the argument. He calms down soon enough. 58 min England could have had three or four goals since half-time. Sterling has just missed another chance, hitting a low shot that was kicked away by Iliev. 56 min \u201cI\u2019m finding the complaints a bit surreal,\u201d says JJ. \u201cIf Rangers were playing Arsenal in the Europa League, Jermain Defoe would be getting booed for every touch he took, and it wouldn\u2019t be racism; it\u2019d be because he used to play for Spurs. Are the jeers now for Rashford and Sterling racist in nature? If not, then they\u2019re just jeers. If they are the only players being jeered and the only two black players on the field, you can be mighty suspicious, but can\u2019t make the conclusion that it\u2019s because of racism. That said, I hope that this game gets closed out, and racists of both countries can just eff off away from football stadiums.\u201d The monkey chants and Nazi salutes arguably gave the game away. 54 min It\u2019s Kosovo 2-0 Montenegro in the other game, so England probably won\u2019t be confirming their place at Euro 2020 tonight. 53 min \u201cNot being perfect in terms of England having its own fair share of racists means you need to be diplomatic but not silent when calling out racism perpetrated by other countries\u2019 fans,\u201d says Niall Mullen. \u201cSouthgate has walked this line extremely well. Nonetheless this needs to be managed dispassionately by UEFA and, where necessary, the justice system. Otherwise the \u2018they started it\u2019 shouty tribalism of football drowns out all sensible discourse.\u201d That\u2019s an excellent point, which became an issue \u2013 through no real fault of Southgate\u2019s \u2013 before the game. 52 min \u201cWhat I find truly unbelievable, in light of the Bulgarian FA\u2019s defence of their fans ahead of the match, is that a load of right wing \u2018ultra\u2019 types were allowed in with \u2018No Respect\u2019 written on their group\u2019s hoodies,\u201d says Andrew Chappell. \u201cWhat were the stadium officials thinking?\u201d Probably that they\u2019d like to see their children again. 51 min Rashford has a close-range shot blocked by Iliev, and Sterling shoves the rebound wide. He probably should have scored. England have played some terrific football tonight. 48 min Kane\u2019s shot is saved by Iliev. 47 min You start to wonder whether you\u2019re imagining it, but I am almost certain Sterling is being jeered (and, presumably, the rest) every time he touches the ball. 46 min England bgegin the second half, and Raheem Sterling is immediately booed. The players are back on the field. Popov is having a long chat with the referee. Bulgaria have made a substitution, but I don\u2019t care. Gareth Southgate has been talking to Uefa officials at half-time. Ivelin Popov, the Bulgaria captain, has spent the interval appealing to the home fans. A number of the extremists left the ground after around half an hour, but there was still plenty of abuse after that. I\u2019d be surprised if the match is completed. More thoughts \u201cWhilst I completely agree with your statement \u2018eat that you racist tossers\u2019 (I cheered a little cheer when Sterling scored) the double standards in condemning racism from other countries annoys me no end,\u201d says Kate in Durham. \u201cWe are by no means perfect in England, and whilst we may have moved on from the darker days in football, in recent weeks there have been racist incidents making the national news at Hartlepool and Middlesbrough matches. Away from football we are even worse. So let\u2019s not get all holier than thou eh, and get our own house/country in order.\u201d Yes, that\u2019s fair. I can\u2019t get my head round it. ITV are showing some footage from the crowd \u2013 Nazi salutes, jumpers with \u2018Uefa Mafia: No Respect\u2019, monkey chants. All the classics. It\u2019s beyond despicable. Half-time chit chat \u201cI know that England can\u2019t exactly take the high ground when it comes to idiotic fans, but it\u2019s so damn frustrating that football can attract such morons,\u201d says Matt Dony. \u201cIt can be such a wonderful, life-affirming thing to be in a stadium cheering on \u2018your\u2019 team (I\u2019m happy to admit to welling up during YNWA), and it can genuinely be a thing of beauty to watch elite athletes giving their best. I\u2019m not the first to make the point that football can bring people together, and I certainly won\u2019t be the last. So how dare these idiots ruin something we love. I\u2019ve sent so many silly emails to MBMs, but this is easily the angriest/most exasperated missive I\u2019ve fired off. I haven\u2019t got a solution; I\u2019m not clever enough to suggest anything. But something, something has to happen.\u201d Abandon the game and award it to the other team. It\u2019s not ideal, but it\u2019s a start. And progress is being made, even if it is taking longer than everyone would like. That\u2019s the end of a surreal, dispiriting 45 minutes. England played well and scored four excellent goals, but the match was stopped twice because of racist abuse. One more stoppage and it should be abandoned, although I wouldn\u2019t rule out it being called off during the interval. Eat that, you racist tossers. Harry Kane, the assist king, gives an open goal to Raheem Sterling at the end of another nice team move. 45+1 min The game has resumed, but Sterling is being booed again. There are six added minutes to be played. 44 min: The match has been stopped for the second time. A number of the home fans are apparently walking out of the stadium. I have no idea what is going on. 43 min: The referee is going to the touchline to talk to the fourth official and Gareth Southgate. 42 min Gareth Southgate has made a second complaint to the fourth official about racist abuse. 40 min \u201cI don\u2019t want to plant ideas in mostly empty heads,\u201d says Shane O\u2019Leary, \u201cbut the Uefa protocol sounds like an invitation for any racists watching their team lose to get busy with the racist guff?\u201d Surely they lose the game anyway if it\u2019s abandoned? 38 min Most of the England players are being booed now, although I\u2019m pretty sure Mings, Rashford and especially Sterling are being jeered the most. For now, however, the match is proceeding as normal. I wouldn\u2019t put money on it finishing, though. 37 min Sterling appeals unsuccessfully for a penalty after being humped in the back by Hadzhiev. That could easily have been given. 35 min It has been confirmed that the England players reported racist abuse earlier in the game. This, by the way, is the standard Uefa announcement in such circumstances: Attention. This is an important security announcement. Because of racist behaviour the referee has said he may have to suspend the match. Racism in football stadiums will not be tolerated. 34 min \u201cHere\u2019s my point as clearly as I can make it \u2013 success against internationals secures a player against failure,\u201d says Hubert O\u2019Hearn. \u201cIf a midfielder has had good, solid matches against a De Bruyne, Fabinho, or pick your favourite, he then has a base layer of confidence so that if he does have a rough match in future he can fall back on the belief that it was just a rough match, and not his true level. And look at Theo Walcott. Any time we see his name, our first thought is, \u2018Oh right, the player Sven called up too soon.\u2019 How many Jack Wilsheres have been tossed out the window after being cast as \u2018the next Gazza?\u2019 What marks a great international isn\u2019t how he fits into a winner \u2013 that\u2019s easy \u2013 it\u2019s how he bounces back from losing and becomes a winner. A failing performance too early in a player\u2019s career makes that harder.\u201d I take the point, I just don\u2019t agree. But I still love you. Ross Barkley gets his second goal with a deft header from Harry Kane\u2019s right-wing cross. Kane has become quite the creator in recent times. 31 min The announcement was step one of Uefa\u2019s protocol for dealing with racist chants. The second is another appeal over the PA system; if that fails, the referee should abandon the match. 30 min The match has resumed, for now. I don\u2019t really know what to say. 29 min The referee is still talking to Harry Kane. There are home fans, some of them in balaclavas, flicking V signs in the direction of the pitch. I don\u2019t think this match is going to continue. 27 min: The match has been stopped, almost certainly because of racist abuse. The referee has been spoken to by an official on the touchline. He\u2019s now talking to Harry Kane. I thought I heard Sterling and Rashford being booed right at the start of the game, but when nobody else said anything I assumed it was my imagination. There is now an announcement over the tannoy, which is also being booed. This, I fear, is about to get very serious. 25 min Zanev has a hack at Sterling, for which he probably should have been booked. 23 min \u201cWorth a mention of England\u2019s most recent qualifying opponent losing 3-2 to Northern Ireland tonight..?\u201d says Iain Gamble. \u201cIt\u2019s only a friendly, but you know...\u201d They just had a bad night on Friday. It happens. Even John Gregory\u2019s Aston Villa occasionally lost a game. The goal was made by Sterling, who quickened the pace with a run infield from the right. He played a neat one-two on the edge of the area with Kane - who has been England\u2019s most penetrative passer in recent games - and drove the ball across the face to give Barkley an open goal. At first I thought it was offside, but on reflection I think Barkley was behind Sterling when the ball was played. There\u2019s no VAR. I\u2019m also not sure whether Sterling was trying to shoot or cross the ball to Barkley. Who cares. Ross Barkley ends a lovely team move to double England\u2019s lead. 18 min Bulgaria are looking reasonably dangerous on the counter-attack. Most of the game is taking place in their half, as you\u2019d expect. 17 min \u201cSomething we can agree on, is good on Rashford,\u201d says Hubert O\u2019Hearn. \u201cI was delighted to see him chosen to start tonight. He and Ross Barkley have something in common: their performances for England are way, way above their club performances. I don\u2019t know why and don\u2019t care, but Marcus Rashford would be a permanent fixture on my best XI every time out.\u201d I can\u2019t work Rashford out. He\u2019s a completely different player from the one who emerged in 2016. But aye, good on him; at his best he\u2019s a cracking footballer. 14 min England are in control, despite that Popov shot a few minutes ago. In the other group game, Kosovo lead Macedonia 1-0. If it stays like that, England can\u2019t qualify tonight. I think it\u2019s time to ask the difficult question: has Gareth Southgate taken this team as far as he can? 12 min \u201cLosing was good for England,\u201d says Steve Waterhouse. \u201cGS needed to be reminded that he cannot pick players willy-nilly based on what\u2019s happened in the last two weeks. There has to be a slightly more holistic approach than that.\u201d Nothing should ever be done willy-nilly, apart from using the phrase \u2018willy-nilly\u2019. 11 min Pickford makes an excellent save, getting down very smartly to his left to push away Popov\u2019s deflected shot. That was a spectacular goal from Rashford. He ran down the wing before losing Pashov with a nice Cruyff turn on the left edge of the box. Then, from a tight angle, he smashed a rising shot that went through Iliev and into the net. Iliev might have done better, on reflection, but it was a vicious strike. As I was saying. This is a storming goal from Marcus Rashford. 6 min It\u2019s been a slow and largely tedious start. Nothing to report apart from that Henderson booking. 3 min Henderson overruns the ball and ploughs through Hadzhiev. He\u2019s booked and will miss England\u2019s next qualifier, against Montenegro next month. I think he slipped, which made it look a bit worse, but he\u2019d already committed to a tackle he was never going to win. 2 min Bulgaria have started in a 5-4-1 formation, not the 4-1-4-1 we expected. Aiming high. 1 min Peep peep! Bulgaria kick off from right to left. They are in white; England are in red. The ground is at least half empty, but there are thousands of England fans belting out God Save The Queen with feeling. \u201cPougatch ought to pull Keane up,\u201d says Bill Hargreaves, \u201cnext time he drops one of those.\u201d Either that or Keane should do this the next time Ross Barkley\u2019s name comes up. \u201cI see your point and as always treat it with true respect,\u201d says Hubert O\u2019Hearn. \u201cHowever, if I may offer up a soupcon of rebuttal served with a massive side dish of self-recrimination, if nine touches in a half followed by a benching really aids development, by that record I should have been named captain of Canada\u2019s national men\u2019s team. Mind you, there\u2019s still hope as Canada 2019 makes Scotland 2019 look like Brazil 1970. No wonder I emigrated.\u201d I don\u2019t really understand the logic, to be honest. It\u2019s not just the nine touches, it\u2019s everything - the build-up, the nerves, the alien environment, the movement on and off the ball. He\u2019s a better player now than he was on Friday morning. Punditry department Mark Pougatch \u201cWhere you would play Ross Barkley? What\u2019s his best position?\u201d Roy Keane \u201cProbably on the bench.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m glad Southgate has chosen what I think is his best XI,\u201d says Hubert O\u2019Hearn. \u201cPlease, no insult is intended towards Mason Mount \u2013 zero percent \u2013 and I\u2019m all for giving youth a chance, but we have to stop giving caps to all lads who have a run of three good matches in their first year in the top division. I\u2019d frankly make it a rule that a player has to have played all the top six (or five if the player is on a top six side) at least once, just to see how he operates against teams brimming with full internationals. Make sense?\u201d I don\u2019t really agree with that. For one, he\u2019ll have had tougher games with Derby than he will with England. I know what you mean about getting too giddy about young players \u2013 Theo Walcott going to Germany, for example \u2013 but I don\u2019t think Southgate has been guilty of that. And experiences like Friday, in what was a can-afford-to-lose game, will accelerate Mount\u2019s development. My opinions are not those of Guardian Media Group, etc, etc. Trent Alexander Bruyne \u201cSouthgate has made how many changes and he still can\u2019t find room for Trent Alexander-Arnold?\u201d sniffs Philip Riston. \u201cMakes no sense to me.\u201d I\u2019d probably play Alexander-Arnold but there\u2019s very little between him, Trippier, Walker and Wan-Bissaka. England don\u2019t cross the ball as much as Liverpool either, and that\u2019s his biggest strength. That said, he had an absurdly good game against Switzerland in the summer. I can see all sides! Pre-match reading/listening Gareth Southgate sticks with a back four, but he does make five changes from the team that lost to the Czech Republic. Tyrone Mings makes his debut, replacing Michael Keane in central defence. Ben Chilwell is in for the suspended Danny Rose, while Harry Winks, Ross Barkley and Marcus Rashford replace Declan Rice, Mason Mount and Jadon Sancho respectively. Bulgaria (4-1-4-1) Iliev; Pashov, Terziev, Hadzhiev, Zanev; Despodov; Popov, Sarmov, Kostadinov, Wanderson; Isa. Substitutes: G Ivanov, Mihaylov, Lozev, Dimitrov, Slavchev, Kraev, Nedyalkov, Malinov, Marcelinho, H Ivanov, Goranov, Karagaren. England (4-1-2-3) Pickford; Trippier, Maguire, Mings, Chilwell; Winks; J Henderson, Barkley; Sterling, Kane, Rashford. Substitutes: Pope, D Henderson, Alexander-Arnold, Keane, Gomez, Rice, Sancho, Tomori, Abraham, Mount, Wilson. Referee Ivan Bebek (Croatia) Hello. Shall we try that one again? England were supposed to clinch their place at Euro 2020 in the Czech Republic on Friday night; instead they suffered a defeat that was somewhere between irritating and alarming. It won\u2019t affect their eventual qualification, but it has altered expectations of what they might achieve next summer. The Three Lionsometer, with It\u2019s Coming Home! at one end and Send Them Home! at the other, has plenty of zinging to do before the tournament begins next June. England have defended shoddily in the last two matches, and something hasn\u2019t quite felt right. We can\u2019t say it\u2019s inertia, because Gareth Southgate has changed the personnel and tactics since the World Cup. Tonight, Matthew, he may revert to the back three that served England pretty well in Russia. Their opponents, Bulgaria, are not the biggest threat. Their last victory was a year ago yesterday, at home to Cyprus, and there are no modern equivalents of Hristo Stoichkov or Georgi Asparuhov in their side. There\u2019s barely a modern equivalent of Boncho Genchev. Bulgaria\u2019s best player is probably Dimitar Berbatov, and he retired from all football last month. England will officially qualify for Euro 2020 if they win and Kosovo fail to win at home to Montenegro. But they know qualification is ahappenin, if not this month then next. It doesn\u2019t matter what happens in Kosovo. What England really want tonight is a win, a clean sheet and no sightings of the Keystone Cops. Kick off is at 7.45pm.",

      "body": "<p>There is no guarantee that good original material will make for a good adaptation. Nor, more inspiringly, will a second-rate work necessarily result in something second-rate in another medium. The Da Vinci Code with Tom Hanks may not have been his finest work, but the film could not have been made worse than its source material (see also Twilight and Fifty Shades of Grey). In TV, perhaps the most consistent proof of the pudding has been in the many successful adaptations of Agatha Christie there have been \u2013 most notably and recently by Sarah Phelps, whose rich, dark versions of the murder mysteries have become a much-anticipated Christmas treat. They work, in part, so brilliantly because you can really only add to Christie. She is not Dan Brown, but as primarily a plot machine whose protagonists are ciphers in its service, she is closer to that end of things than the other.</p> <p>Now Phelps has turned her hand to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0009fhr\" title=\"\">Dublin Murders</a> (BBC One), an eight-part adaptation of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/aug/01/book-beach-in-the-woods-tana-french\" title=\"\">In the Woods</a> and The Likeness, two very good books by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/feb/16/tana-french-powerfu\" title=\"\">Tana French</a>, an author very much at the other end of the scale. They are the first (and best) two thrillers in her Dublin Murder Squad series, and are among the most intricately plotted, beautifully written and psychologically acute examples of the genre that you will find. There is little to be added to such fine-grained work \u2013 and much to be lost. French is a delicate builder of characters\u2019 interior worlds, a precise mapper of the endlessly fascinating convolutions of both ordinary and murderous minds. None of this translates readily to the screen. That is not a fault; it is innate to the two mediums: one primarily visual, the other not.</p> <p>It is not clear yet whether she has found anything to add to French\u2019s work, or a way to reproduce all that, in careless hands, is in danger of being lost.

      "bodyText": "There is no guarantee that good original material will make for a good adaptation. Nor, more inspiringly, will a second-rate work necessarily result in something second-rate in another medium. The Da Vinci Code with Tom Hanks may not have been his finest work, but the film could not have been made worse than its source material (see also Twilight and Fifty Shades of Grey). In TV, perhaps the most consistent proof of the pudding has been in the many successful adaptations of Agatha Christie there have been \u2013 most notably and recently by Sarah Phelps, whose rich, dark versions of the murder mysteries have become a much-anticipated Christmas treat. They work, in part, so brilliantly because you can really only add to Christie. She is not Dan Brown, but as primarily a plot machine whose protagonists are ciphers in its service, she is closer to that end of things than the other. Now Phelps has turned her hand to Dublin Murders (BBC One), an eight-part adaptation of In the Woods and The Likeness, two very good books by Tana French, an author very much at the other end of the scale. They are the first (and best) two thrillers in her Dublin Murder Squad series, and are among the most intricately plotted, beautifully written and psychologically acute examples of the genre that you will find. There is little to be added to such fine-grained work \u2013 and much to be lost. French is a delicate builder of characters\u2019 interior worlds, a precise mapper of the endlessly fascinating convolutions of both ordinary and murderous minds. None of this translates readily to the screen. That is not a fault; it is innate to the two mediums: one primarily visual, the other not. It is not clear yet whether she has found anything to add to French\u2019s work, or a way to reproduce all that, in careless hands, is in danger of being lost. But if we judge the first episode, as is probably fairest, as that of a police murder-mystery series, it is a sophisticated and slickly satisfying operation. We open with a man in a basement in the throes of a breakdown, watched by an expressionless young woman as he mutters desperately. \u201cWhat if the killed are the lucky ones?

In 1986, The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, one of the most vital and prescient works of modern fiction, was pipped to the prize by Kingsley Amis\u2019s The Old Devils. With Margaret Atwood now elevated to the status of a contemporary prophet, 2019 may have seemed like an opportunity to redress that mistake. Published with all the fanfare of a new Harry Potter and accounting for 86% of shortlist sales, her sequel has dominated this year\u2019s award, sprinkling some much-needed publishing glitz.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/oct/14/booker-prize-judges-break-the-rules-and-insist-on-joint-winners\">Booker prize judges break the rules and insist on joint winners</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Testaments is a fascinating follow-up to Atwood\u2019s initial story of Gilead, giving sharp insights into power and collusion through Aunt Lydia\u2019s confession of her role in the theocratic regime. As Atwood has said, with women\u2019s rights increasingly under threat in the US, the world seems to be moving closer to Gilead rather than further away. The book is gripping, pacy and beautifully written, though later sections in which two young women take on the patriarchy devolve into action adventure closer to the spinoff television series than to the austere mood of Atwood\u2019s original.</p> <p>But another novel called to the judges, too, leading to the shock decision to \u201cbreak the rules\u201d, as the Booker\u2019s literary director Gaby Wood complained at the press conference, by sharing the prize between Atwood and the British author Bernardine Evaristo, whose Girl, Woman, Other is a landmark in fiction of a different kind.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"92f4ff8ade5227c2cf236d2152364081138c3558\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/92f4ff8ade5227c2cf236d2152364081138c3558/0_127_5563_3337/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Margaret Atwood poses with The Testaments, the joint Booker prize winner, at the London ceremony.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Margaret Atwood poses with The Testaments, the joint Booker prize winner, at the London ceremony.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tolga Akmen/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To honour Evaristo\u2019s novel, which intertwines 12 narratives about black women in Britain, is to shine a much-deserved spotlight on an author who has blazed a trail in subject matter and style for a quarter of a century.

      "bodyText": "With the hindsight of history, the Booker misses plenty of tricks. In 1986, The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, one of the most vital and prescient works of modern fiction, was pipped to the prize by Kingsley Amis\u2019s The Old Devils. With Margaret Atwood now elevated to the status of a contemporary prophet, 2019 may have seemed like an opportunity to redress that mistake. Published with all the fanfare of a new Harry Potter and accounting for 86% of shortlist sales, her sequel has dominated this year\u2019s award, sprinkling some much-needed publishing glitz. The Testaments is a fascinating follow-up to Atwood\u2019s initial story of Gilead, giving sharp insights into power and collusion through Aunt Lydia\u2019s confession of her role in the theocratic regime. As Atwood has said, with women\u2019s rights increasingly under threat in the US, the world seems to be moving closer to Gilead rather than further away. The book is gripping, pacy and beautifully written, though later sections in which two young women take on the patriarchy devolve into action adventure closer to the spinoff television series than to the austere mood of Atwood\u2019s original. But another novel called to the judges, too, leading to the shock decision to \u201cbreak the rules\u201d, as the Booker\u2019s literary director Gaby Wood complained at the press conference, by sharing the prize between Atwood and the British author Bernardine Evaristo, whose Girl, Woman, Other is a landmark in fiction of a different kind. To honour Evaristo\u2019s novel, which intertwines 12 narratives about black women in Britain, is to shine a much-deserved spotlight on an author who has blazed a trail in subject matter and style for a quarter of a century. Today, British publishing is at last eager for diverse voices: Evaristo\u2019s whole oeuvre, she says, has been an answer to the question: \u201cWhat does it mean to not see yourself reflected in your nation\u2019s stories?\u201d The Testaments is a global bestseller, whereas Girl, Woman, Other is a brilliantly topical but leftfield novel crying out for a publicity push.

      "bodyText": "Poland\u2019s ruling rightwing Law and Justice (PiS) party has narrowly won a second term in office, but its grip on power was weakened after it lost control of the upper house and failed to increase its majority in the more powerful lower chamber. What had looked like a clear-cut victory for PiS turned into a far tighter contest, with final results showing that while the party won just under 44% of Sunday\u2019s vote for the lower house or Sejm, up from 38% in 2015, it secured only 235 seats in the 460-seat assembly \u2013 the same total as in 2015. In the 100-seat senate the opposition claimed victory, with the centrist Civic Coalition publishing on Twitter the names of 51 opposition members and allies who had won seats, dealing a blow to the socially conservative party\u2019s ambitions. Control of the senate, which has a say in a number of key state appointments such as Poland\u2019s civil rights ombudsman, would also allow the opposition to block or delay legislation proposed by PiS. Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski, the party leader, who had been hoping for a two thirds majority of seats in the Sejm that would have allowed him to reshape the constitution, conceded on Monday that the loss of the upper house meant the government would inevitably face delays in its legislative agenda. A PiS senator, Jan Maria Jackowski, also said the party had found itself in a \u201cnew situation\u201d in the senate and would have to negotiate to pass laws. Stanley Bill, a senior lecturer in Polish politics at the University of Cambridge, asked: \u201cCould PiS\u2019s high-water mark have passed? Their second term is shaping up as a greater challenge than their first. Parliament will be trickier, with more parties to contest their policies from different directions.\u201d He said the party risked \u201closing momentum.\u201d The other main recipients of votes were the main opposition party Civic Coalition (27.4%), the Left, a grouping of leftwing parties (12.56%), the conservative Polish Coalition (8.6%) and a new far-right party, Confederation (6.8%), according to the electoral commission. Coming on the day that Hungary\u2019s prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, suffered his biggest electoral blow in a decade, losing control of the capital, Budapest, the worse-than-forecast Polish result marked a setback for eastern Europe\u2019s right-wing nationalists. During its first term in power, PiS gained a reputation for pushing through legislation at breakneck speed, with hastily called late-night sittings of the Sejm, followed by quick approval from the upper house. PiS\u2019s political strategy was to combine a big increase in social spending in certain areas, made against the backdrop of a booming economy and record consumer confidence, with nationalist and traditionalist rhetoric and an uncompromising authoritarian political style that has exacerbated divisions in Polish society. Even an underwhelming PiS victory, however, could pose problems for Brussels and other European capitals. In government, the party has been an uncompromising and at times exasperating EU member, as illustrated by a farcical episode in 2017 when it tried to torpedo the re-election of Donald Tusk, a former leader of Civic Platform, as president of the European council. For years, the European commission has sparred with Warsaw over PiS\u2019s attempts to assert direct control over the Polish judiciary, with several cases referred to the European court of justice. Under PiS, Poland has emerged as an active opponent of the liberal democratic values that underpin the EU, with European diplomats admitting in private that many in Brussels had hoped the problem would be taken out of their hands by Polish voters. \u201cThere was a hope that PiS would lose, but that has not materialised,\u201d said Piotr Buras, the director of the Warsaw office of the European Council on Foreign Relations thinktank. \u201cThis is not just an issue for Brussels, but for several European capitals; they will have to deal with an emboldened partner. \u201cThe dilemma is that Poland under PiS is already a semi-authoritarian regime and it is only likely to deteriorate further. There will be a temptation to turn a blind eye to abuses and normalise relations, but this could come at a cost to their red lines on democratic values.\u201d Additional reporting by Marcin Goc\u0142owski",

      "body": "<h2>Mercedes march on</h2> <p>Sealing their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/13/formula-one-japanese-grand-prix-valtteri-bottas-mercedes-constructors-championship\" title=\"\">sixth consecutive constructors\u2019 championship</a> and ensuring they will secure a record sixth constructors\u2019 and drivers\u2019 double had an almost inevitable air after Mercedes\u2019 strong start to the season. Having clinched it in Japan, their inexorable march should not detract from a remarkable achievement. It stretches back to the groundwork laid by Ross Brawn and the structures he created back in 2010. Three years of hard work and development ensued and what has emerged since has been outstanding. The team has come through on top after two major regulation changes, a feat never achieved before. After 2014 they were untouchable and in 2017, while the fight intensified, they remained on top. Nor should it be assumed that their success is simply a virtue of spending. In recent times both Toyota and Honda have proved that money alone guarantees nothing. A tighter battle at the front would be more than welcome and long overdue but it means others stepping up to match a Mercedes team showing no sign of weakness.</p> <h2>Ferrari stumble again</h2> <p>Sebastian Vettel described Mercedes as \u201cclose to perfection\u201d after the Japanese Grand Prix, where the Scuderia were once again found wanting. For the second race in succession they blew the chance to control the race. Vettel\u2019s start cost him a shot at the win and Charles Leclerc hitting Max Verstappen took him out of contention. Perhaps worst of all, however, was how they dealt with the result of that. Mattia Binotto had spoken about how key it was to manage his drivers. Yet when Ferrari told Leclerc to come in to fix his damaged front wing, their driver stayed out. It was costly, dangerous and suggested that some control has slipped from the pitwall. Leclerc\u2019s wing disintegrated, showering Lewis Hamilton with wreckage, and debris ended up in Lando Norris\u2019s brake ducts, scuppering his chances. Leclerc and Ferrari took a penalty for not bringing the car in having told the FIA they would so. About which the race director, Michael Masi, described himself as \u201cmore than slightly annoyed from a safety perspective\u201d. There is, it seems, a latitude between team and drivers that Ferrari must consider.</p> <h2>The one-handed backlash</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/F1/status/1183357969175592960\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Yeah, going through 130R is cool.

F1 posted a video of the driver attempting to check its stability. He did so while going through 130R and consequently took the once fearsomely challenging corner one-handed. That the current formula enables a driver to so do is far from the advert F1 doubtless intended and it was mercilessly picked up on social media. Martin Brundle was, as ever, spot on with his considered response. \u201cWhilst I admire the precision and confidence in driving one-handed while attempting DIY at the same time, and desperately staying away from \u2018in my day\u2019, but the legendary 130R corner becoming effectively a straight line saddens me,\u201d he tweeted. Some team members have long bemoaned that the sport has become run by engineers for whom higher downforce is all and with whose supremacy the challenge for drivers has dissipated. The 2021 regulations are supposed to address this but in Suzuka six teams were revealed to still oppose the new rules as they stand and the 31 October deadline looms ever larger.</p> <h2>Ricciardo\u2019s reason to grin</h2> <p>With Renault enduring a disappointing season and Daniel Ricciardo having had a particularly testing time at recent races, the Australian\u2019s run from 16th to sixth was reason to be cheerful. Albeit one still subject to he FIA\u2019s investigation into Racing Point\u2019s protest at their brake bias system. Ricciardo had retired early in Russia and in Singapore started from the back after grid penalties. Japan had not looked like it would offer an improvement. A suspension problem cost him in qualifying and with overtaking tricky a long race awaited. However Ricciardo took to his task enthusiastically and unsurprisingly for one so adept at passing, began scything through the field. Renault too played his strategy well, giving him softs for a late charge and moving his teammate Nico H\u00fclkenberg aside for him to do so. It paid off and he promptly dispatched Lance Stroll and Pierre Gasly. It was the performance he and Renault wanted and need. As a works team, fighting back from 16th is not where they want to be.</p> <h2>Super Sunday flags up the future</h2> <p>With Typhoon Hagibis ravaging parts of Japan, Suzuka escaped lightly. High winds and rain turned out to be the worst of it on the coastline where the track sits 300km south-west of Tokyo. Qualifying was rightly postponed for safety reasons on the Saturday and by Sunday blue skies greeted the action. There was a lot to pack into the day but that it went well will have been noted by F1 as it considers how race weekends might change. There were only three hours between qualifying and the race, and some concern it would be difficult to turn everything around. But the teams and organisers managed it with aplomb. It even proved long enough for Williams to rebuild Robert Kubica\u2019s car around a new chassis after his crash. Reverse grid sprint races on a Saturday are still hoped to be given a trial next year with France and Spa in the frame to host them. F1 is also believed to be looking at ways to shorten the race weekend. Sunday qualifying as demonstrated in Suzuka may yet be a proposal.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Mercedes march on Sealing their sixth consecutive constructors\u2019 championship and ensuring they will secure a record sixth constructors\u2019 and drivers\u2019 double had an almost inevitable air after Mercedes\u2019 strong start to the season. Having clinched it in Japan, their inexorable march should not detract from a remarkable achievement. It stretches back to the groundwork laid by Ross Brawn and the structures he created back in 2010. Three years of hard work and development ensued and what has emerged since has been outstanding. The team has come through on top after two major regulation changes, a feat never achieved before. After 2014 they were untouchable and in 2017, while the fight intensified, they remained on top. Nor should it be assumed that their success is simply a virtue of spending. In recent times both Toyota and Honda have proved that money alone guarantees nothing. A tighter battle at the front would be more than welcome and long overdue but it means others stepping up to match a Mercedes team showing no sign of weakness. Ferrari stumble again Sebastian Vettel described Mercedes as \u201cclose to perfection\u201d after the Japanese Grand Prix, where the Scuderia were once again found wanting. For the second race in succession they blew the chance to control the race. Vettel\u2019s start cost him a shot at the win and Charles Leclerc hitting Max Verstappen took him out of contention. Perhaps worst of all, however, was how they dealt with the result of that. Mattia Binotto had spoken about how key it was to manage his drivers. Yet when Ferrari told Leclerc to come in to fix his damaged front wing, their driver stayed out. It was costly, dangerous and suggested that some control has slipped from the pitwall. Leclerc\u2019s wing disintegrated, showering Lewis Hamilton with wreckage, and debris ended up in Lando Norris\u2019s brake ducts, scuppering his chances. Leclerc and Ferrari took a penalty for not bringing the car in having told the FIA they would so. About which the race director, Michael Masi, described himself as \u201cmore than slightly annoyed from a safety perspective\u201d. There is, it seems, a latitude between team and drivers that Ferrari must consider. The one-handed backlash Leclerc\u2019s clash with Verstappen left his wing mirror loose. F1 posted a video of the driver attempting to check its stability. He did so while going through 130R and consequently took the once fearsomely challenging corner one-handed. That the current formula enables a driver to so do is far from the advert F1 doubtless intended and it was mercilessly picked up on social media. Martin Brundle was, as ever, spot on with his considered response. \u201cWhilst I admire the precision and confidence in driving one-handed while attempting DIY at the same time, and desperately staying away from \u2018in my day\u2019, but the legendary 130R corner becoming effectively a straight line saddens me,\u201d he tweeted. Some team members have long bemoaned that the sport has become run by engineers for whom higher downforce is all and with whose supremacy the challenge for drivers has dissipated. The 2021 regulations are supposed to address this but in Suzuka six teams were revealed to still oppose the new rules as they stand and the 31 October deadline looms ever larger. Ricciardo\u2019s reason to grin With Renault enduring a disappointing season and Daniel Ricciardo having had a particularly testing time at recent races, the Australian\u2019s run from 16th to sixth was reason to be cheerful. Albeit one still subject to he FIA\u2019s investigation into Racing Point\u2019s protest at their brake bias system. Ricciardo had retired early in Russia and in Singapore started from the back after grid penalties. Japan had not looked like it would offer an improvement. A suspension problem cost him in qualifying and with overtaking tricky a long race awaited. However Ricciardo took to his task enthusiastically and unsurprisingly for one so adept at passing, began scything through the field. Renault too played his strategy well, giving him softs for a late charge and moving his teammate Nico H\u00fclkenberg aside for him to do so. It paid off and he promptly dispatched Lance Stroll and Pierre Gasly. It was the performance he and Renault wanted and need. As a works team, fighting back from 16th is not where they want to be. Super Sunday flags up the future With Typhoon Hagibis ravaging parts of Japan, Suzuka escaped lightly. High winds and rain turned out to be the worst of it on the coastline where the track sits 300km south-west of Tokyo. Qualifying was rightly postponed for safety reasons on the Saturday and by Sunday blue skies greeted the action. There was a lot to pack into the day but that it went well will have been noted by F1 as it considers how race weekends might change. There were only three hours between qualifying and the race, and some concern it would be difficult to turn everything around. But the teams and organisers managed it with aplomb. It even proved long enough for Williams to rebuild Robert Kubica\u2019s car around a new chassis after his crash. Reverse grid sprint races on a Saturday are still hoped to be given a trial next year with France and Spa in the frame to host them. F1 is also believed to be looking at ways to shorten the race weekend. Sunday qualifying as demonstrated in Suzuka may yet be a proposal.",

Tanya is finishing her first attempt at mosaic and thinking about a plant stand as her next project. Sharyn is assembling broken tiles from a box of donated materials to create decorative edging for her garden beds. Terry is making a gumboot stand for her grandchildren out of discarded and varnished chair legs. These tinkerers are part of a global movement. From Amsterdam to Perth, people are visiting repair cafes, maker-spaces and workshops to discover how they can repair and reuse \u2013 rather than repeating a cycle of buying, breaking and re-buying. In Shellharbour, many of the tinkerers met at the local bromeliad and succulent society, where they encouraged each other to have a go at this new initiative. Learning how to use power tools was the big attraction. \u201cOur husbands are not very handy,\u201d says one. Several heads nod. \u201cSome of us were already pretty crafty, doing things like decoupage or rag rugs, but we\u2019d never attempted furniture or upholstery before,\u201d says another. Media roundup The Australian reports that Labor senator Kim Carr \u201chas supported collaboration with Chinese researchers and launched an assault on \u2018cold-war warriors\u2019, \u2018Sinophobes\u2019 and \u2018hawks within the defence and security establishments\u2019.\u201d The Sydney Morning Herald reveals that revised figures for the number of asylum seekers who arrive by plane is 65 per day, not the 80 per day claimed last week. Westpac\u2019s warning that \u201ca political pile-on could result in the loss of its AA credit rating\u201d leads the Australian Financial Review this morning. Coming up International Pregnancy and Infant Loss Remembrance Day, which commemorates the death of a newborn, will be acknowledged by a cross-party motion in the Senate to mark the day.

      "bodyText": "The former environment minister Josh Frydenberg sought urgent information about an investigation for land clearing brought by his department against a company in which fellow minister Angus Taylor and his relatives held an interest, new documents show. A week after parliament resumed in February 2017, and shortly after his department began an investigation into clearing of critically endangered grasslands at the Taylor family-owned property, Frydenberg\u2019s office contacted the environment and energy department saying it required \u201curgent talking points\u201d because the case had been raised in parliament. But Hansard transcripts for that time show no record of the matter being raised in either the House or the Senate chambers, raising the possibility it was discussed with Frydenberg by an unnamed person privately. The new documents also raise serious questions about public statements made by both Frydenberg and Taylor about the nature of their interactions over the grasslands saga. Both ministers have insisted there was nothing untoward about Taylor\u2019s interest in the grasslands and it was confined to briefings about policy related to their listing as critically endangered. In a statement to parliament in July, Taylor said farmers raised concerns about the listing with him in late 2016 and early 2017 and, specifically, that he sought a briefing after he had a conversation with a farmer near Yass on 21 February 2017. But an email, obtained by Guardian Australia under freedom of information laws, along with replies to questions on notice from a Senate committee, show Frydenberg\u2019s office was asking about the compliance matter almost a week before that date. Jam Land, part owned by Taylor and his family, was the only company under investigation for alleged illegal clearing of grasslands at the time. About 30 hectares of the critically endangered grassland known as the natural temperate grassland of the south eastern highlands had been allegedly poisoned at a property in Delegate, New South Wales, in late 2016. Angus Taylor\u2019s brother, Richard, is one of the directors of Jam Land and the minister himself holds an interest via his family company Gufee. Taylor told parliament in July that his indirect interest in Jam Land was declared in accordance with the rules through his family company. Illegal land clearing under federal environmental laws can attract both civil and criminal actions. Penalties can be as high as $900,000 for an individual and $9m for a company. The courts can also order remediation of the land or payments towards conservation. Three years on, the case has not concluded, with the department saying the investigation is \u201congoing\u201d. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The new information reveals Frydenberg\u2019s office requesting information earlier than previously known and specifically on the compliance action. It has come to light in response to questions on notice from a Senate committee examining Australia\u2019s faunal extinction crisis and through Freedom of Information requests by the Guardian. In response to the Senate committee, the environment department said Frydenberg\u2019s office sought information about the \u201ccompliance action\u201d against Jam Land on 15 February 2017. It said it provided information related to the case to Frydenberg\u2019s office on 15 February, 16 February, 21 February 2017 and March 7 and later that year on 28 July 2017, 3 August and 12 and 25 October. \u201cThe department is not aware of what, if anything, the Office of Minister Frydenberg communicated to Minister Taylor in any of these instances,\u201d the department said in its response to the committee. An internal department email sent from the environment standards division on 16 February 2017, and obtained by Guardian Australia, shows staff were being asked to prepare advice about the listing of the grasslands after they were told by Frydenberg\u2019s office a compliance case was raised in parliament. \u201cAs discussed, it appears a NTGSEH (natural temperate grassland of the south eastern highlands) case was raised in parliament yesterday, and we have been asked to urgently draft some dot points about the listing,\u201d (name redacted) says. \u201cCan you please provide a point about the amount of engagement, consultation and education (particularly with the farming community) that was undertaken in the listing process\u201d. The email continues: This is a handwritten note we got from a phone call with the Minister\u2019s (Frydenberg\u2019s) office\u201d: \u201cPossible compliance action. \u201cSouth East Highland Grassland. \u201c - (Former environment minister Greg) Hunt made a change (listing status priority) \u201c - What was change, when, why, implications \u201cACT/NSW border\u201d. Guardian Australia has been unable to find any public record of the case being raised in the chamber. The correspondence and requests for advice raise serious questions about whether Frydenberg\u2019s office was in fact seeking information on a live case involving a colleague rather than responding to a matter before parliament, whether this was an appropriate use of public resources and what information on the ongoing investigation was relayed to Taylor, if any. Guardian Australia has previously revealed that Frydenberg\u2019s office sought a meeting with senior environment officials in March 2017 on Taylor\u2019s behalf. The meeting, between Taylor, Frydenberg\u2019s office and senior officials, occurred on 20 March 2017. Both ministers and the department have repeatedly stated the compliance action was not discussed at the meeting. When asked about the new earlier contacts, both men referred to their earlier statements and declined to answer a number of specific questions about what had prompted the interest in the case on 15 February. In an interview with the ABC in September, Frydenberg said Taylor informed him of his family\u2019s interest in Jam Land when he asked for the March meeting. \u201cI became aware (of the interest) when he asked me for a meeting. He was very up-front. And he said that there was a family company which was subject to a compliance issue. And that he had an indirect interest in that company,\u201d Frydenberg said at the time. \u201cBut he was seeking a meeting on the technical aspects of the listing and in those circumstances, as is appropriate, (there would not be) be any discussion of the compliance issue.\u201d Taylor told parliament in a statement in July that he had \u201cnever made a representation in relation to the compliance action\u201d. \u201cI never would,\u201d he said. \u201cMy focus was advocating for the interests of the farmers in my electorate and across the region.\u201d Frydenberg has refused to answer more specifically when he became aware of Taylor\u2019s interest in Jam Land or exactly what was disclosed. The ministerial code of conduct says \u201cit is critical that ministers do not use public office for private purposes.\u201d The code also requires ministers to report any actual or potential conflict of interest arising from shareholdings to the prime minister. Despite questions from the Guardian, neither minister has said whether they reported the potential issues arising from Taylor\u2019s interest in a company under investigation to the prime minister. The Guardian has learned, and documents released under FOI show, the department was acutely aware of the sensitivity of the legal case and the need to steer clear of talking about it when they met with Taylor. In a separate question from the faunal extinctions committee, published late last week, the committee asked if Frydenberg or anyone in his office advised the department of Taylor\u2019s interest when requesting department staff meet with him. \u201cNo,\u201d the department responded. When asked about the interactions with the minister\u2019s office in February and again in July, August and October about the compliance action, the department said: \u201cThe enquiries from the minister\u2019s office were general in nature, including requesting updates on the investigation and provision of talking points. \u201cAs the minister is responsible for administering the EPBC Act, the department routinely provides high-level updates on emerging or ongoing compliance actions to the minister\u2019s office.\u201d Do you know more?

      "body": "<p>The moment that changed the Middle East arrived with a sudden silence. Just before 7pm on Sunday, the internet was cut across north-eastern Syria where, for half an hour, the Kurds of the region had been digesting a news flash. The Syrian government was returning to two towns, Manbij and Kobane. The implication quickly sunk in.</p> <p>The regional capital, Qamishli, soon emptied; streets that had bustled with minibuses and shoppers became eerie and still. With the internet down phones were no help and nor were officials who had vanished along with the traffic. Air seemed to be suddenly vacuumed from the city, and the few people still around knew exactly what it meant: this was the moment power changed hands. It was a time to be scared.</p> <p>\u201cYou must leave now,\u201d one man said, avoiding eye contact. \u201cThere are regime checkpoints to the east and it isn\u2019t safe to stay.\u201d He, and other Kurds had lived all their lives, except for the past seven years, under the control of the government in Damascus, and the prospect of their return left him pale and worried.</p> <p>The Syrian army had maintained a presence in central Qamishli ever since Bashar al-Assad gave the Kurds semi-autonomy in 2012. They had always been toothless next to a larger and better armed rival. But could they be emboldened now? Their base was only 200 metres away.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"c401401f5c01abae22e979a5fb49a20296d57ed9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c401401f5c01abae22e979a5fb49a20296d57ed9/0_239_4308_2585/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Turkey-backed Syrian fighters kneel to pray as they gather near the village of Qirata on the outskirts of the Manbij.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Turkey-backed Syrian fighters kneel to pray as they gather near the village of Qirata on the outskirts of the Manbij.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aaref Watad/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A black sky covered the road to the border, the sparkling white lights of Turkey to the left and the Syrian army somewhere in the darkness to the right. Usually diligent Kurdish checkpoint guards had left their posts, or were preoccupied. Lone speeding cars and belching lorries without headlamps rumbled through the night, perhaps the last to make the journey before the conquerors arrived.</p> <p>A day later, the ramifications of the momentous week that preceded the Kurds allowing the Assad regime to retake the province is still sinking in, across Syria and far beyond in Riyadh, Baghdad, Cairo and the Gulf. </p> <p>Something far bigger was at play here; the end of US influence in Syria and the plunge in its status elsewhere. The public handover on show was that between the Assad regime and the Kurds, but the real power shift was between Washington \u2013 whose fighting troops have all but left the region, 16 years after invading Iraq \u2013 and Moscow, whose reach and influence across the Middle East has now been cemented.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4a44fb9153e3cd5b07e06bcb017d9571577f4d19\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4a44fb9153e3cd5b07e06bcb017d9571577f4d19/0_72_4792_2875/1000.jpg\" alt=\"King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud with President Putin before talks on Monday in a golf-type buggy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud with President Putin before talks on Monday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mikhail Metzel/Tass</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As if to celebrate the moment, Vladimir Putin arrived in Riyadh for a state visit on Monday, his first in 12 years, hosted by Saudi Arabia\u2019s Crown Prince, Mohammed bin Salman, who three weeks earlier had similarly felt the humiliation of abandonment by US allies.</p> <p>After Iran launched an attack against the kingdom\u2019s oil production centres, the crown prince was expecting a US retaliation. None was forthcoming, and he felt abandoned by an ally that had sworn to protect Saudi interests. \u201cDid you see what they [the US] did to us?\u201d the crown prince asked Iraqi leaders in Riyadh a fortnight ago. \u201cIt was unbelievable.\u201d</p> <p>In northern Syria, the US decision to abandon the Kurds, who had helped lead the global fight against Isis, had bewildered locals and left them with very few options. \u201cIt\u2019s better to go for compromise than genocide,\u201d said Muzlum Abdi, commander in chief of the US-raised force, formerly known as the SDF.</p> <p>Kurds, led by leaders of the Kurdistan Workers party (the PKK) had held talks with Russian officials in Qamishli in recent days about the terms of their pact with Damascus. Fighting Turkey to the north, and left without a protector after Donald Trump ordered the US military to leave, the Kurds held a very weak hand.</p> <p>\u201cThe Russians have been accusing us of allowing the Americans into the region in the first place,\u201d said Arshan Mizgin Ahmed. \u201cWe have paid a heavy political price for that.\u201d</p> <p>She added: \u201cWe will do whatever is in our best interests.\u201d</p> <p>As the US withdrew, what remained of its authority was increasingly tested. A jet buzzed a US base near Ain Issa \u2013 the US military won\u2019t say who it was. Up the road, Turkish Arab proxies, who had executed a Kurdish politician on a highway a day earlier were setting up base.</p> <p>As time ticked away on the last vestige of Kurdish rule, the Syrian military arrived \u2013 packed into cattle trucks \u2013 in the town of Tal Tamir, where Kurdish fighters had been bringing their wounded only hours earlier.</p> <p>Their arrival would have likely heartened one of the country\u2019s most recent refugees, Ahmad Mahmoud Hussein, who a day before had raged against Turkey\u2019s proxies \u2013 Arabs from elsewhere in Syria, who had just forced him from his home in the town of Ras al-Ayn. \u201cThey are mercenaries, hired guns,\u201d he claimed. \u201cThey are all ex-convicts and drug addicts and they have no honour or mercy. Those who fall for what Turkey are offering them will do anything for money. I don\u2019t care if I\u2019m sleeping on this school floor for one year, two years, or 10. I\u2019m not going back while they\u2019re still there.\u201d</p> <p>The dying days of the war in all its horror and contradictions played out on television screens across the Kurdish north, where normal transmissions had resumed after Sunday\u2019s Big Brother-like shutdown. In the border town of Derik, drivers watched with looks of resignation as Kurdish families threw rice at the feet of Assad\u2019s soldiers. \u201cHe\u2019s acting,\u201d said one of the men watching another Kurd on the television. \u201cNo he isn\u2019t, he\u2019s relieved,\u201d said another.</p> <p>Past scorched brown hills, along undulating roads to the border, the faces of the vanquished showed a similar mixture of resignation, and confusion. For the Kurds the dream of autonomy has ground to a halt. The new alliances taking shape on the ruins of their ambitions will be felt for generations in what remains of Syria.</p> <p>\u201cIran and Russia are the dominant foreign powers now,\u201d said Arshan. \u201cThey will dictate terms in this region. Things have really changed.\u201d</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Mohammed Rasool</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "The moment that changed the Middle East arrived with a sudden silence. Just before 7pm on Sunday, the internet was cut across north-eastern Syria where, for half an hour, the Kurds of the region had been digesting a news flash. The Syrian government was returning to two towns, Manbij and Kobane. The implication quickly sunk in. The regional capital, Qamishli, soon emptied; streets that had bustled with minibuses and shoppers became eerie and still. With the internet down phones were no help and nor were officials who had vanished along with the traffic. Air seemed to be suddenly vacuumed from the city, and the few people still around knew exactly what it meant: this was the moment power changed hands. It was a time to be scared. \u201cYou must leave now,\u201d one man said, avoiding eye contact. \u201cThere are regime checkpoints to the east and it isn\u2019t safe to stay.\u201d He, and other Kurds had lived all their lives, except for the past seven years, under the control of the government in Damascus, and the prospect of their return left him pale and worried. The Syrian army had maintained a presence in central Qamishli ever since Bashar al-Assad gave the Kurds semi-autonomy in 2012. They had always been toothless next to a larger and better armed rival. But could they be emboldened now? Their base was only 200 metres away. A black sky covered the road to the border, the sparkling white lights of Turkey to the left and the Syrian army somewhere in the darkness to the right. Usually diligent Kurdish checkpoint guards had left their posts, or were preoccupied. Lone speeding cars and belching lorries without headlamps rumbled through the night, perhaps the last to make the journey before the conquerors arrived. A day later, the ramifications of the momentous week that preceded the Kurds allowing the Assad regime to retake the province is still sinking in, across Syria and far beyond in Riyadh, Baghdad, Cairo and the Gulf. Something far bigger was at play here; the end of US influence in Syria and the plunge in its status elsewhere. The public handover on show was that between the Assad regime and the Kurds, but the real power shift was between Washington \u2013 whose fighting troops have all but left the region, 16 years after invading Iraq \u2013 and Moscow, whose reach and influence across the Middle East has now been cemented. As if to celebrate the moment, Vladimir Putin arrived in Riyadh for a state visit on Monday, his first in 12 years, hosted by Saudi Arabia\u2019s Crown Prince, Mohammed bin Salman, who three weeks earlier had similarly felt the humiliation of abandonment by US allies. After Iran launched an attack against the kingdom\u2019s oil production centres, the crown prince was expecting a US retaliation. None was forthcoming, and he felt abandoned by an ally that had sworn to protect Saudi interests. \u201cDid you see what they [the US] did to us?\u201d the crown prince asked Iraqi leaders in Riyadh a fortnight ago. \u201cIt was unbelievable.\u201d In northern Syria, the US decision to abandon the Kurds, who had helped lead the global fight against Isis, had bewildered locals and left them with very few options. \u201cIt\u2019s better to go for compromise than genocide,\u201d said Muzlum Abdi, commander in chief of the US-raised force, formerly known as the SDF. Kurds, led by leaders of the Kurdistan Workers party (the PKK) had held talks with Russian officials in Qamishli in recent days about the terms of their pact with Damascus. Fighting Turkey to the north, and left without a protector after Donald Trump ordered the US military to leave, the Kurds held a very weak hand. \u201cThe Russians have been accusing us of allowing the Americans into the region in the first place,\u201d said Arshan Mizgin Ahmed. \u201cWe have paid a heavy political price for that.\u201d She added: \u201cWe will do whatever is in our best interests.\u201d As the US withdrew, what remained of its authority was increasingly tested. A jet buzzed a US base near Ain Issa \u2013 the US military won\u2019t say who it was. Up the road, Turkish Arab proxies, who had executed a Kurdish politician on a highway a day earlier were setting up base. As time ticked away on the last vestige of Kurdish rule, the Syrian military arrived \u2013 packed into cattle trucks \u2013 in the town of Tal Tamir, where Kurdish fighters had been bringing their wounded only hours earlier. Their arrival would have likely heartened one of the country\u2019s most recent refugees, Ahmad Mahmoud Hussein, who a day before had raged against Turkey\u2019s proxies \u2013 Arabs from elsewhere in Syria, who had just forced him from his home in the town of Ras al-Ayn. \u201cThey are mercenaries, hired guns,\u201d he claimed. \u201cThey are all ex-convicts and drug addicts and they have no honour or mercy. Those who fall for what Turkey are offering them will do anything for money. I don\u2019t care if I\u2019m sleeping on this school floor for one year, two years, or 10. I\u2019m not going back while they\u2019re still there.\u201d The dying days of the war in all its horror and contradictions played out on television screens across the Kurdish north, where normal transmissions had resumed after Sunday\u2019s Big Brother-like shutdown. In the border town of Derik, drivers watched with looks of resignation as Kurdish families threw rice at the feet of Assad\u2019s soldiers. \u201cHe\u2019s acting,\u201d said one of the men watching another Kurd on the television. \u201cNo he isn\u2019t, he\u2019s relieved,\u201d said another. Past scorched brown hills, along undulating roads to the border, the faces of the vanquished showed a similar mixture of resignation, and confusion. For the Kurds the dream of autonomy has ground to a halt. The new alliances taking shape on the ruins of their ambitions will be felt for generations in what remains of Syria. \u201cIran and Russia are the dominant foreign powers now,\u201d said Arshan. \u201cThey will dictate terms in this region. Things have really changed.\u201d Additional reporting by Mohammed Rasool",

      "body": "<p>An estimated 50 nuclear bombs stored at a US airbase in Turkey have become potential bargaining chips in the tense relationship between Washington and Ankara in the wake of the Turkish offensive into Syria.</p> <p>Although Donald Trump gave a green light to the offensive in a phone call eight days ago with the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, the US Congress is planning to impose severe sanctions on Turkey. Trump, facing a backlash from his party for acquiescing in the invasion, has backed punitive measures.</p> <p>On Monday the EU declared an arms embargo on Turkey, and a planned bipartisan bill in Congress would sanction Turkish leaders and cut off US weapons supplies.</p> <p>Erdo\u011fan has said he will respond aggressively to western attempts to isolate Turkey and has vowed not to halt the offensive.</p> <p>\u201cWe are determined to take our operation to the end. We will finish what we started,\u201d the Turkish leader said during a visit to Baku, Azerbaijan. \u201cA hoisted flag does not come down.\u201d</p> <p>The presence of B61 nuclear gravity bombs at \u0130ncirlik airbase, which is about 100 miles from the Syrian border and which the US air force shares with its Turkish counterpart, is complicating Washington\u2019s calculations.</p> <p>In recent days administration officials have been quietly reviewing plans to move the bombs, the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/14/world/middleeast/trump-turkey-syria.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage\">New York Times reported</a> on Monday. The report quoted a senior official as saying the bombs had become Erdo\u011fan\u2019s hostages and that flying them out of \u0130ncirlik would be the de-facto end of the Turkish-American alliance.</p> <p>Plans to remove the bombs have frequently been considered but never put into action. Officials are not supposed to discuss the existence of forward-deployed bombs in Turkey and four other Nato member states but they are an open secret. They are a cold war relic with no operational function in a war plan. To deploy them the US would have to fly in planes to carry them. Turkey has no planes certified to carry nuclear weapons.</p> <p>Discussions within Nato over the past three decades about withdrawing them have foundered on opposition from member states including Turkey, who saw them as valuable symbols of US commitment to their defence through extended deterrent.</p> <p>A former official said there was considerable discussion in the Obama administration on what to do with the bombs, both because of Barack Obama\u2019s disarmament agenda and particularly over security fears after the 2016 coup attempt in Turkey. The base was used by some of the plotters including a general who at one point <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/03/world/europe/turkey-coup-incirlik-air-base.html\">sought protection with his US colleagues</a>, which was denied. Erdo\u011fan\u2019s government cut off power to the base before moving in to arrest suspects.</p> <p>According to one former official, Turkish diplomats responded to suggestions that the bombs might be removed by saying Turkey would develop its own nuclear weapons.</p> <p>\u201cThe potential problems have been discussed for over a decade. And now we\u2019ve finally gotten to a point where this is a problem that we can\u2019t ignore any more,\u201d the former US official said.</p> <p>Erdo\u011fan underlined that <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-nuclear-erdogan/erdogan-says-its-unacceptable-that-turkey-cant-have-nuclear-weapons-idUSKCN1VP2QN\">threat last month</a>, declaring at a party rally that it was \u201cunacceptable\u201d for Turkey not to have its own arsenal. He claimed falsely: \u201cThere is no developed nation in the world that doesn\u2019t have them.\u201d</p> <p>As a signatory to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, Turkey has committed not to acquire nuclear weapons.</p> <p>Alexandra Bell, a senior policy director at the Centre for Arms Control and Non-proliferation, said the Trump administration did not have confirmed officials in key posts that would normally be tasked with dealing with such nuclear dilemmas.</p> <p>\u201cThe president is sending out angry tweets and I don\u2019t think giving the proper amount of attention and concern to what is a potentially volatile situation,\u201d Bell said.</p> <p>Jeffrey Lewis, a non-proliferation expert at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, said: \u201cThe US doesn\u2019t need Turkey\u2019s agreement to remove the weapons. The US can do it unilaterally, and I think the US should do it unilaterally and do it immediately.

      "bodyText": "An estimated 50 nuclear bombs stored at a US airbase in Turkey have become potential bargaining chips in the tense relationship between Washington and Ankara in the wake of the Turkish offensive into Syria. Although Donald Trump gave a green light to the offensive in a phone call eight days ago with the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, the US Congress is planning to impose severe sanctions on Turkey. Trump, facing a backlash from his party for acquiescing in the invasion, has backed punitive measures. On Monday the EU declared an arms embargo on Turkey, and a planned bipartisan bill in Congress would sanction Turkish leaders and cut off US weapons supplies. Erdo\u011fan has said he will respond aggressively to western attempts to isolate Turkey and has vowed not to halt the offensive. \u201cWe are determined to take our operation to the end. We will finish what we started,\u201d the Turkish leader said during a visit to Baku, Azerbaijan. \u201cA hoisted flag does not come down.\u201d The presence of B61 nuclear gravity bombs at \u0130ncirlik airbase, which is about 100 miles from the Syrian border and which the US air force shares with its Turkish counterpart, is complicating Washington\u2019s calculations. In recent days administration officials have been quietly reviewing plans to move the bombs, the New York Times reported on Monday. The report quoted a senior official as saying the bombs had become Erdo\u011fan\u2019s hostages and that flying them out of \u0130ncirlik would be the de-facto end of the Turkish-American alliance. Plans to remove the bombs have frequently been considered but never put into action. Officials are not supposed to discuss the existence of forward-deployed bombs in Turkey and four other Nato member states but they are an open secret. They are a cold war relic with no operational function in a war plan. To deploy them the US would have to fly in planes to carry them. Turkey has no planes certified to carry nuclear weapons. Discussions within Nato over the past three decades about withdrawing them have foundered on opposition from member states including Turkey, who saw them as valuable symbols of US commitment to their defence through extended deterrent. A former official said there was considerable discussion in the Obama administration on what to do with the bombs, both because of Barack Obama\u2019s disarmament agenda and particularly over security fears after the 2016 coup attempt in Turkey. The base was used by some of the plotters including a general who at one point sought protection with his US colleagues, which was denied. Erdo\u011fan\u2019s government cut off power to the base before moving in to arrest suspects. According to one former official, Turkish diplomats responded to suggestions that the bombs might be removed by saying Turkey would develop its own nuclear weapons. \u201cThe potential problems have been discussed for over a decade. And now we\u2019ve finally gotten to a point where this is a problem that we can\u2019t ignore any more,\u201d the former US official said. Erdo\u011fan underlined that threat last month, declaring at a party rally that it was \u201cunacceptable\u201d for Turkey not to have its own arsenal. He claimed falsely: \u201cThere is no developed nation in the world that doesn\u2019t have them.\u201d As a signatory to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, Turkey has committed not to acquire nuclear weapons. Alexandra Bell, a senior policy director at the Centre for Arms Control and Non-proliferation, said the Trump administration did not have confirmed officials in key posts that would normally be tasked with dealing with such nuclear dilemmas. \u201cThe president is sending out angry tweets and I don\u2019t think giving the proper amount of attention and concern to what is a potentially volatile situation,\u201d Bell said. Jeffrey Lewis, a non-proliferation expert at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, said: \u201cThe US doesn\u2019t need Turkey\u2019s agreement to remove the weapons. The US can do it unilaterally, and I think the US should do it unilaterally and do it immediately. If people are really concerned that this is going to somehow be the final nail in the coffin, it\u2019s kind of silly as the coffin is firmly nailed shut. The relationship is in total freefall.\u201d However, Vipin Narang, a nuclear expert and political scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said removing the weapons would not be straightforward. \u201cExtracting them under these circumstances may be incredibly risky since it would involve removing 50 nuclear weapons from the vaults, moving them on a Turkish base and flying them out of Turkish airspace,\u201d Narang said. \u201cThey could be vulnerable to accidents, theft or attack.\u201d As the Turkish offensive continues, Turkey\u2019s place in the Nato alliance has come under increasing strain.

Holding up gag order signs, protesters gathered outside the court ahead of a hearing to stop protests against equality lessons taking place at Anderton Park primary school. The school, in the Sparkhill area of the city, has become the focus of a long campaign to halt LGBT equality messages being taught in the classroom. Headteacher Sarah Hewitt-Clarkson, who was subjected to almost three hours of cross-examination, told the court that protest leader Shakeel Afsar had behaved aggressively towards her and tried to \u201cwhip up a frenzy\u201d in a bid to stop the lessons. The heated protests were led by mainly by Pakistani-heritage Muslim parents, who say the lessons are in conflict with their \u201creligious beliefs and family values\u201d. On Monday, a high court application by Birmingham city council to make an exclusion zone around the school permanent started. The council launched court action in a bid to prevent more protests outside the school after about 300 people gathered at the gates in May. An emergency interim order was granted, and later extended in June, which sought to halt any more gatherings near the primary school that could disrupt pupils or intimidate staff.

      "bodyText": "Folderol, hokum and flapdoodle \u2013 the usual absurdities of the Queen\u2019s speech rigmarole were reduced to their ultimate fatuity on Monday. As she named those 26 never-to-be-enacted bills engraved laboriously on goatskin vellum, they might as well have been scribbled in ballpoint pen, these electioneering geegaws and giveaways, embellished with thumbscrews on crime and migration. But nothing matters here except the evanescent promise of an EU withdrawal deal, always just beyond reach. \u201cMy government will \u2026\u201d she intoned as if sucking lemons, but she has no government capable of doing anything at all. What heavy lifting it would take to turn this country into Boris Johnson\u2019s \u201cgreatest place on Earth\u201d, in its present miserable state caused mainly by him. Leave aside Brexit devilment that hangs by a thread, look at the rest of his empty prospectus. If this was a hunting expedition designed to shoot Labour\u2019s fox, it may have the opposite effect. Black Rod summoned the Commons to hear the end of austerity, but that\u2019s almost as much sham humbuggery as all the rest. There is indeed to be spending, enough to set both the last Tory chancellors gnashing their teeth at the loss of their ill-gotten austerity savings. But come an election, mere announcements of a bit of easing up won\u2019t expunge the bitter era of cuts that will scar the public service landscape for years to come. Bungs may ease the worst, preventing deeper cuts, but Johnson\u2019s \u201csacred\u201d NHS, schools and police are as stretched and stricken as ever, the jam promised for next year only thinly spread. And there\u2019s still the rawness of a million public sector jobs axed and 2,000 food banks serving those who lost working tax credits. But here\u2019s the tripwire, Johnson\u2019s catch-22. He will only win if he has pulled off Brexit \u2013 but his version, Britain out of both customs union and single market, will drastically shrink his own Treasury receipts. His Brexit will push the economy into near-recession just as the world teeters towards a Trump trade war slowdown. Already his Brexit referendum victory has made us \u00a355bn poorer, Paul Johnson of the Institute for Fiscal Studies says, pointing to three years of lost productivity on top of this decade of stagnant living standards. Johnson\u2019s Brexit will push his government back into austerity, so in his victory would be his own defeat. Strip away his florid bluster on the NHS and schools, and the reality for public services will be continued belt-tightening. Next year the NHS gets a slight breather: not the 40 new hospitals emblazoned across his favourable press, but just six, the repairs problem acute in mental and community health units. The 10,000 doctors and 40,000 nurses missing due to George Osborne\u2019s early cuts in training places will not be found: expect decades of shortages, as the Nuffield Trust says twice as many training places are needed. The pain of the cuts was never fairly distributed, so watch these small easements go to better-off places. Take schools: the 5% increase next year is what Johnson calls a \u201clevelling up\u201d, taking from the schools with most to give to those with less funding. Sounds fair? Not when that means giving to well-heeled Tory shires while taking from deprived areas in greater need. Analysts find 83% of schools will still be worse off next year than in 2015, with \u00a3245 less for each primary pupil, and \u00a3304 for secondary pupils. No Tory Queen\u2019s speech is complete unless it commands \u201cBoris blitz on crooks\u201d front pages the following day. True, Labour often did it, ratcheting up punishment for one day\u2019s headlines, each cheap gesture doubling the number of prison cells with inmates deprived of any means to prevent reoffending. Priti Patel\u2019s hostile-environment Home Office ends free movement and vows to round up every EU unfortunate who failed to apply for settled status, chasing away migrants that the economy desperately needs. It\u2019s easy to predict her \u201ccontrol with compassion\u201d watchword will cause more Windrush abominations, with lifelong inhabitants wrongly removed. Popular? No longer, as migration has dropped in public concerns. Little surprise that there is no plan for social care \u2013 now \u201con its knees\u201d, warns the Nuffield Trust. But as Theresa May found, that\u2019s far too hot to handle; like climate change, which gets no mention as to how Johnson would ever get on track to reach net-zero carbon emissions. Little in his menu is what it seems, none frames a vision or idea: just focus-grouped pleasers. For political skulduggery, a bill forcing voters to turn up with passport or driving licence will exclude the poor and the young, with 9 million not registered, since David Cameron stopped colleges automatically signing up their over-18s. Shoot Labour\u2019s fox? More likely Johnson has shot himself in the foot. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) says his spending plans match those in Labour\u2019s last manifesto, which were roundly condemned by May as unaffordable. With one bound, he has freed Labour from accusations of financial incontinence. Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s manifesto will offer far more, appealing to those the Tories forget, particularly women, with free childcare, social care and tuition fees. Though the IFS may accuse both parties of busting their budgets, as it always adds, that isn\u2019t overspending if they raise taxes too. In this low-tax country that pays a lot less tax than it did, Labour will tax the rich and corporations, while Johnson gifts top earners a \u00a39bn cut. \u201cTired of stasis, gridlock and waiting for change\u201d was Johnson\u2019s biting portrait of the country\u2019s mood; but who should voters blame for that?

      "bodyText": "The Catalan independence crisis erupted again on Monday as police and protesters clashed at Barcelona airport hours after the Spanish supreme court jailed nine Catalan separatist leaders over their roles in the failed bid for secession two years ago. Protesters took to the streets, with many gathering at Barcelona\u2019s El Prat airport after the court acquitted the nine defendants of the charge of violent rebellion but convicted them variously of sedition, misuse of public funds and disobedience. By late afternoon, thousands of protesters had answered a call from the Tsunami Democr\u00e0tic movement designed to bring the airport to a standstill. Thousands set off by car, train and metro. When police closed the station, even more made the three-and-a-half hour journey on foot. Several people were injured as police baton-charged protesters on the concourse of Terminal 1, the main international terminal. Foam bullets were reported to have been fired and video emerged of national and the regional Catalan police beating demonstrators and attacking journalists. Thirteen people received medical attention and more than 60 flights were cancelled. Tsunami Democr\u00e0tic later claimed to be trying to use cars to bring Madrid\u2019s Barajas airport to a similar standstill. On Monday morning, Catalonia\u2019s former vice-president Oriol Junqueras was convicted of sedition and misuse of public funds and sentenced to 13 years in prison. He was also banned from holding public office for 13 years. The former Catalan foreign minister Ra\u00fcl Romeva, labour minister Dolors Bassa and regional government spokesman Jordi Turull were each convicted of the same offences and sentenced to 12 years\u2019 imprisonment and handed 12-year bans on holding office. Carme Forcadell, a former speaker of the Catalan parliament, was sentenced to 11 and a half years, while the former interior minister Joaquim Forn and territorial minister Josep Rull got 10 and a half years each. Two influential pro-independence grassroots activists, Jordi Cuixart and Jordi S\u00e0nchez, were found guilty of sedition and given nine-year sentences. Three other independence leaders were found guilty of disobedience and handed fines and bans from holding office. The four-month trial heard from 422 witnesses and investigated the events that triggered the country\u2019s worst political crisis since it returned to democracy after the death of General Franco. Less than five hours after the seven judges\u2019 verdicts were announced, an international arrest warrant was reissued for the former Catalan president Carles Puigdemont, who spearheaded the push for independence. The warrant said Puigdemont, who fled into self-imposed exile in Belgium to avoid arrest by the Spanish authorities, was wanted for alleged sedition and misuse of public funds. Junqueras urged supporters not to give up on Catalan independence. \u201cWe\u2019ll return stronger and with even more belief than ever,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cThanks to everyone, keep fighting because we will keep fighting for ever.\u201d S\u00e0nchez, a regional MP and former president of the influential grassroots Catalan National Assembly, said his nine-year sentence would not dent his optimism nor his belief in an independent Catalonia. He made a plea for calm. \u201cLet\u2019s express ourselves without fear and move forward, non-violently, towards freedom,\u201d he tweeted. Spain\u2019s acting prime minister, the socialist leader Pedro S\u00e1nchez, said his government respected the supreme court\u2019s decision, which he said met all the requirements of due process, transparency and separation of powers. \u201cNobody is above the law,\u201d he said. \u201cIn a democracy like Spain, nobody is subject to trial for his or her ideas or politics but rather for criminal conduct as provided by the law.\u201d S\u00e1nchez said the Catalan independence movement had tried to subvert the Spanish constitution and had created a fracture within Catalan society \u201cby refusing to recognise the majority who oppose independence\u201d. He said the government would work to guarantee public order in the coming days. A large number of officers descended on Barcelona airport and the city\u2019s Sants railway station and at Girona\u2019s main railway station. The Catalan president, Quim Torra, urged an amnesty for those convicted but said the sentences would not deflect his administration from pressing on with its quest for independence. \u201cRepression will never triumph over dialogue, democracy and self-determination,\u201d he said. Torra also called for meetings with the central government, adding: \u201cWe have always been prepared to talk and discuss this political conflict, which, now more than ever, requires a political solution.\u201d Spain\u2019s education minister, Isabel Cela\u00e1, who also acts as the government\u2019s spokeswoman, called for calm and renewed dialogue\u2013 but stressed that the court\u2019s decision had to be respected. She said the acting government had tools at it disposal to deal with disobedience and unrest\u2013 including article 155 of the constitution, which the previous government used to assume direct control of Catalonia two years ago \u2013 but that it would prefer a return to the negotiating table. Cela\u00e1 told the Guardian that she hoped moderation would prevail: \u201cThere are some groups who won\u2019t listen to a rational message at the moment, but daydreaming won\u2019t lead us anywhere except to a place it\u2019ll be harder to return from. \u201cThere\u2019s no alternative to dialogue in accordance with the law between the representatives of public authorities \u2026 There needs to be democratic resolve to respect judicial decisions so that we can open a new chapter of coexistence.\u201d The trial centred on a referendum held on 1 October 2017 in defiance of the government at the time, under the conservative prime minister Mariano Rajoy, and of the country\u2019s constitution, which is founded on the \u201cindissoluble unity of the Spanish nation\u201d. Also scrutinised were the events of 20 September 2017, when police raided Catalan regional government offices and arrested 14 senior officials in an attempt to head off the vote. The raids brought thousands of Catalans out to protest. Guardia Civil officers became trapped inside the buildings they were searching and three of their vehicles were vandalised. The defendants have already said they will appeal to the European court of human rights. A spokeswoman for the European commission said it respected the decisions of the Spanish judiciary. \u201cOur position on this is well known and has not changed,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is, and remains, an internal matter for Spain, which has to be dealt with in line with its constitutional order.\u201d",

Speaking at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research in London, he said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>What has happened is an accretion of power around the prime minister and the special adviser group around the prime minister, and it works to the detriment of Whitehall and of departments as a whole.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Saying that both Jeremy Hunt and Sajid Javid had been circumvented by Theresa May and Boris Johnson in turn, he said the marginalisation of ministers had damaged the country at large. </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We\u2018ve got to go back to a view that the prime minister\u2019s senior adviser on any policy issue is his secretary of state. The prime minister must not get to thinking that all announcements have to come out of No 10.</p> \n   <p>When they [special advisers] start to suppress and supplant the advice of the civil service, then they are beginning to do damage.

Urging the government to redouble its efforts and to raise military spending to offset the hit to Britain\u2019s status, he said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We\u2019ve fallen back in international esteem and we\u2019ve lost an awful lot of ground.</p> \n   <p>The UK and the EU have to work very closely together to be relevant globally. The US-UK relationship will not be secondary to that, but it will not substitute that. Any government leadership post Brexit has got to be very clear on that point.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He said government spending on defence as a proportion of the economy should rise from 2% at present to 2.2%, adding: \u201cWe must bring something to the table or people will not be talking to us as we have taken ourselves out.\u201d</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"113ce8ae7c198118d214f5de6a93a805ea6a8c41\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/113ce8ae7c198118d214f5de6a93a805ea6a8c41/0_128_3839_2303/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andrew Turnbull\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andrew Turnbull</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leon Neal/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-14T13:13:26.205Z\">at 2.13pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5da467e88f084862358fdbd7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/severincarrell\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-14T12:23:14.099Z\">1.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon</strong> has said she tries to avoid \u201cstressing and worrying\u201d about the potential impact of the Alex Salmond trial on her life, telling an interviewer \u201cwhat will be will be\u201d.<br><br>Salmond, her predecessor as first minister and mentor, is expected to stand trial early next year for alleged sex offences, which he has repeatedly denied. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jan/24/alex-salmond-scotlands-former-first-minister-arrested\">He was charged in January with 14 offences</a> including two of attempted rape, with senior Scottish National party figures expected to be called to give evidence. </p> \n  <p>In <a href=\"https://www.holyrood.com/news/view,nicola-sturgeon-says-she-wont-spend-a-lot-of-time-stressing-or-worrying-abo_14548.htm\">an interview with Holyrood magazine</a> to mark Scottish National party conference, Sturgeon said she was focusing on her work as first minister and party leader.

Cunningham told delegates:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The people of Scotland know who they can trust to provide leadership. They can\u2019t trust Labour. And they certainly can\u2019t trust the Tories. Both parties will the ends, but never the means. </p> \n   <p>Last week they had their chance to step up to the plate and they failed. And people can\u2019t trust the Greens either. At this crucial moment in Scotland\u2019s climate change journey, when it came time to pass those targets into law, they sat on their hands. </p> \n   <p>So conference, let me offer this advice to you, and to every member of the SNP. Lend your vote to the Greens? So they can sit on their hands in the face of world leading ambition? I don\u2019t think so!</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The enmity on this seems to be mutual.

They write:<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>One option under consideration in Number 10 is that, if the EU accepted in principle Johnson\u2019s customs partnership for the Northern Ireland proposal without a backstop, but said it needed more time to iron out the details, Johnson could agree to a three-month technical extension to Article 50.</p> \n   <p>Some senior Tories believe that Johnson could present this outcome to the public as the prime minister successfully \u201cgetting Brexit done\u201d by October 31, with a deal agreed in principle and the backstop removed. A technical extension would be used to negotiate the final details and the UK would formally leave at a later date.</p> \n   <p>The downside to this would be that the UK will not have legally left the EU on October 31, contrary to the public position of Johnson and Cummings.</p> \n   <p>In this scenario, a general election could be delayed until 2020, also contrary to Johnson and Cummings\u2019 original plan. There are rising fears among senior ministers that the Conservatives would be squeezed by Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit Party in a pre-Brexit election.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>At the No 10 lobby briefing the PM\u2019s spokesman played down this suggestion (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/oct/14/brexit-latest-news-queens-speech-branded-farcical-as-talks-in-eu-still-fail-to-achieve-breakthrough-live-news?page=with:block-5da44d418f083d8b3b9db80e#block-5da44d418f083d8b3b9db80e\">11.27am)</a> and said Johnson was clear that the UK would be leaving the EU on 31 October.</p> \n  <p>The government\u2019s <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/839035/Queen_s_Speech_background_briefing.pdf\">Queen\u2019s speech briefing pack (pdf),</a> in the section on the EU (withdrawal agreement) bill, says one of the main benefits of the bill would be ensuring the UK leaves the EU with a deal on 31 October.</p> \n  <p>But it is worth noting that the Queen herself, in her speech, did not commit to hitting the 31 October deadline. She just said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>My government\u2019s priority has always been to secure the United Kingdom\u2019s departure from the European Union on 31 October. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The Queen\u2019s speech is drafted by the government, but the palace is consulted and presumably the Queen\u2019s aides would have been unhappy about her stating as fact that the UK would be leaving on 31 October when at the moment that is only an aspiration.

People are tired of stasis, gridlock and waiting for change. They don\u2019t want to wait for improvements in their hospitals. They don\u2019t want to wait for their streets to be made safer. They don\u2019t want to wait for their schools to have the funding they need to give their children the superb education they deserve. </p> \n   <p>And they don\u2019t want to wait any longer to get Brexit done and to answer that clarion call of 17.4m people in the greatest exercise of democracy in our national history.</p> \n   <p>So we are going to get the gears on our national gearbox working again. Leaving the EU is a defining opportunity for us to set a new course and a new direction for our country \u2013 to do the things we have not been allowed to for decades, to tear away that bureaucratic red tape, to set our own rules, and to release the talent, creativity, innovation and chutzpah that exists in every corner of our United Kingdom.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>It is striking how, despite being one of the architects of the vote to leave the EU, Johnson is now desperate to move beyond the \u201cgridlock\u201d that the referendum result engendered.</p> \n  <p>In his statement, Johnson also revives a line that he used during his speech to the Tory conference. He says:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p> If there is one great British institution that has the emotional force to bring our country together, it is our NHS. It is sacred in our nation precisely because at its heart is the simple beauty of the principle that whoever you are, no matter where you come from, if you fall sick the whole country gathers figuratively at your bedside.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>(You can see why Johnson is taken by the metaphor, but I\u2019m not sure it works.

Given the numbers in current parliament it is highly likely..</p>\n     </div> \n    </div> \n   </div> \n  </figure> \n  <p>Before the Fixed-term Parliaments Act was passed in 2011, the Queen\u2019s speech vote counted as a confidence matter and a government that lost was expected to resign. <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/hung-parliaments-have-voted-down-the-queens-speech-before-heres-what-happened-79384\">That is what happened in 1886, 1892 and 1924</a>. Those votes all took place after general elections, and on each occasion a new administration took power without another election being called.</p> \n  <p>The last election was more than two years ago and, if the FTPA was not on the statute book, you would expect Boris Johnson to respond to a defeat on the Queen\u2019s speech by calling an election.</p> \n  <p>But, of course, that is not an option for him. Under the FTPA a government motion for an early election would need the support of two thirds of MPs in the Commons for it to have force, and Johnson has failed twice to get a motion passed meeting that threshold.</p> \n  <p>If Johnson does lose the vote, he might try again to force an early election. He could table a confidence motion in his own government (although it is hard to see what this would achieve), or he could table a no confidence motion and ask his MPs to abstain (because if a no confidence motion gets passed, and no other administration takes over within 14 days, an election has to happen under the FTPA). As well as being risky, this would be seen as an abuse of process and, although theoretically possible, it is possible that it could be disallowed by the Speaker.</p> \n  <p>But Johnson could also just ignore a vote against the Queen\u2019s speech. A defeat like that would not stop him governing; it would not be like a vote against the budget, which would stop the government raising taxes. At the end of the Queen\u2019s speech all MPs are actually voting on is a motion saying they should send a humble address to the Queen thanking her for attending parliament. If Johnson loses the vote, all that technically happens is that the Queen does not get the note. One less thing to read. She probably wouldn\u2019t mind ...</p> \n  <p><em>UPDATE: </em><strong>David Howarth</strong>, a Cambridge law professor and former Lib Dem MP, has been in touch to say losing a vote on the Queen\u2019s speech does have at least one practical effect. He explains:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>You might be interested to know that there would be a practical consequence for the government of losing the motion on the address completely (as opposed to losing on an amendment to it).</p> \n   <p>Standing order 51 says that the government can\u2019t move a ways and means resolution without notice unless the address has been agreed to. What this means is that if the government fails to get the address through the house, it can\u2019t bring in emergency tax changes, e.g. to beat avoidance schemes, without letting the world know first, which might be very inconvenient in current circumstances.</p> \n   <p>Perhaps more important, that standing order could be amended by the house to say that the government can\u2019t bring in a budget at all until the address has been passed, something it might do if Boris Johnson loses a vote on the Queen\u2019s speech and then refuses to follow the convention that prime ministers defeated on the Queen\u2019s speech should resign.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-14T16:23:29.139Z\">at 5.23pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5da439658f08b13ca7c7a142\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-14T09:01:54.816Z\">10.01am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ff4d19565e486244df18db88a633afb658f68ec7\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ff4d19565e486244df18db88a633afb658f68ec7/0_130_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Yeomen of the Guard during the ceremonial search of the Houses of Parliament, ahead of the state opening of parliament\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yeomen of the Guard during the ceremonial search of the Houses of Parliament, ahead of the state opening of parliament</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Victoria Jones/PA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5da438df8f084862358fd993\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-14T08:59:39.112Z\">9.59am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>From Bloomberg\u2019s Brexit correspondent<strong> Ian Wishart</strong></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/IanWishart/status/1183659252721823744\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">This is where the Brexit talks stand right now.

      "bodyText": "Jeremy Corbyn has condemned the government\u2019s planned legislative programme outlined in the Queen\u2019s speech as \u201ca farce\u201d, as he signalled he would back a general election that could deliver a Labour government within weeks. Prison reform charities have condemned the government\u2019s enthusiasm for extending minimum prison terms as \u201cthe politics of the lynch mob\u201d and an unnecessary duplication of existing judicial powers. Boris Johnson received a boost when one of the most hardline Tory Brexiters signalled that he would back his revised plan for an alternative to the Irish backstop. (See 4.44pm.) Boris Johnson will not resign if his Queen\u2019s speech is voted down by MPs, Downing Street has said. Scots are choosing to reject the \u201clies and division\u201d of populists in favour of backing independence, John Swinney, Scotland\u2019s deputy first minister, has told the SNP conference. He said people across the country were \u201cholding fast to the values of truth, integrity and honesty\u201d. Delivering a rebuke to Donald Trump and Boris Johnson, Swinney said the campaign for independence would walk a road of tolerance and persuasion in winning over \u2018no\u2019 voters. He went on: While we deride their behaviour, we must learn the lessons of the victories of Trump and Johnson. They chose - and still choose - the gutter and it will be their downfall. Winning on their terms is never worth it. Their road does not lead to a better nation. Their road leads to ruin and we will never walk that road. Instead, we will walk the road of tolerance, persuasion, debate and dialogue. We will set ourselves the goal of living every day as though we are in the first days of a new nation. We do so for two simple reasons - first, because it is the right thing to do, and second, because it will make our country anew. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. This is what a Downing Street source said when asked about why what the Queen said about the possibility of the UK leaving the EU on 31 October was less definitive than what Boris Johnson has been saying on this. (See 12.57pm.) The source rejected suggestions that the palace rejected No 10\u2019s proposed wording, and went on: I appreciate there are differences in language but those differences in language are more reflective of the fact that\u2019s how a Queen\u2019s speech goes rather than any suggestion that there are any differences in policy. The prime minister was very clear that we are leaving on 31 October. Jon Worth from the College of Europe has been trying to work out how Boris Johnson could get the votes to pass a Brexit deal. He has posted a Twitter thread (what else?) starting here. And here is his conclusion. From my colleague Heather Stewart Earlier I wrote a post saying that, if the government lost the vote on the Queen\u2019s speech next week, the defeat would have no practical effect. But David Howarth, a Cambridge law professor and former Lib Dem MP, has been in touch to say that it is not as simple as that, and that defeat would tie Boris Johnson\u2019s hands in at least one respect. See 10.36am for the update. You may need to refresh the page to get the update to appear. As I said earlier, the opening of the Queen\u2019s speech debate wasn\u2019t exactly a cornucopia of news stories, but here are the better lines, as far as they went. Boris Johnson received a boost when one of the most hardline Tory Brexiters signalled that he would back his revised plan for an alternative to the Irish backstop. (See 4.44pm.) Johnson said the government would protect military veterans from \u201cunfair prosecution\u201d. Asked why the Queen\u2019s speech did not include a bill implementing this pledge, Johnson said legislation would be introduced in due course. He said: This government understands that no-one can escape justice for a crime that they have committed. But we also understand that there should be no unfair prosecution when no new evidence has been produced. Jeremy Corbyn dismissed the Queen\u2019s speech as a \u201cfarce\u201d. He explained: There has never been such a farce as a Government with a majority of -45 and a 100% record of defeat in the House of Commons setting out a legislative agenda they know cannot be delivered in this parliament. Johnson said the government would legislate to enshrine the rights of EU nationals in law. Asked by the Tory MP Alberto Costa if he would \u201cunequivocally enshrine in primary legislation the rights of my mother and father, and three million other EU nationals\u201d, Johnson replied: Yes, not only can I give him that absolutely and unequivocal guarantee but I\u2019m delighted to say two million EU nationals in this country have already registered under the EU registration system. Corbyn accused the government of a \u201cblatant attempt ... to rig the result\u201d of the next election\u201d through its plans for compulsory photographic ID at polling stations. He said: We will not allow this government to stifle democracy by making it harder for people to vote \u2013 there was only one instance of voter personation at the last election. Eleven million in this country don\u2019t have a passport or driving licence. There are huge risks in such legislation, which will disproportionately affect working class, ethnic minority and young voters. Ed Miliband, the former Labour leader, has also spoken out on this. Corbyn accused the government of creating a \u201clost generation\u201d. He said: We have, almost, a lost generation. Children going to school in under-staffed schools, very few teaching assistants, headteachers going out with a begging bowl to parents to try to match the school budget. And too many young people growing up in incredible levels of stress, of bad housing and of stress and worry about the future. That contributes to the mental health crisis that this country, as a whole, must address. Johnson refused to confirm that the government remains committed to the HS2 B line to Leeds. Asked about its future by Anna Soubry, the former Tory who now leads the Independent Group for Change, Johnson said that HS2 was being reviewed and that there would be more on this in the budget on 6 November. Johnson compared a shake-up in Corbyn\u2019s office to \u201cSoviet-era expulsions\u201d. Referring to Corbyn, Johnson said: Frankly I fear for his political health. We can see the Soviet-era expulsions that are taking place in his circle. As one by one, his lieutenants are purged as Lenin purged the associates of poor-old Trotsky. Pointing to the shadow chancellor John McDonnell, Johnson went on: And there is Lenin, the veteran fabricator of GLC budgets, as the shadow chancellor tightens his icy-grip on the Labour party. My colleague Owen Jones thinks Johnson\u2019s history is awry. Boris Johnson received a boost when one of the most hardline Tory Brexiters signalled that he would back his revised plan for an alternative to the Irish backstop. Lee Rowley, one of the 28 so-called Brexiter \u201cSpartans\u201d who voted against Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal three times, opened the Queen\u2019s speech debate, in his role as the proposer of the loyal address. It is the first time the Commons has sat since it emerged on Thursday that a compromise customs plan could be the basis for a UK-EU Brexit deal. Rowley signalled that he was now minded to back what the government was planning. In his speech he said: In the last few days there is at least hope that this toxic and crippling fog, which we have created, might just be lifting as the prime minister sketches the outline of a way forward \u2013 and I speak as someone who has been robust in my review of previous proposals \u2013 but the house must surely see, as I do, that we have debated long enough. This is a moment for decision and we were elected to make decisions. If there is light at the end of the tunnel later this week, and heaven knows I hope there will be, we have a fundamental responsibility in this place to try and resolve this most vexed of problems and allow our despairing country to move on. For the health of our democracy and to restore faith in this most venerable of institutions, in my view we simply must get Brexit done. The House of Commons library has become the latest Brexit-monitoring body to try its hand at a \u2018What happens next?\u2019 flowchart. It\u2019s from this briefing note. Normally at this point in the proceedings I would post some sort of verdict. But there is no point. Partly that\u2019s because that was almost a news-free occasion. Jeremy Corbyn and Boris Johnson both gave serviceable speeches, but neither of them said anything much that they have not said before. (There were a few very minor lines, that I will post in a moment.) But mainly it\u2019s because ITV\u2019s Robert Peston has summed up the problem with the debate so well it is hard to improve on it. Johnson ends saying he believes in a \u201cgenerous, tolerant, outward-looking and humane society\u201d. And that\u2019s it. Johnson says he wants a Britain where \u201cfairness and balance\u201d are at the heart of what we do. He says the government should be fighting crime. But he says he agrees with Jeremy Corbyn on the importance of rehabilitation. Johnson says, after Brexit, the UK will be able to ban the export of live animals. That is something the public will welcome, he says. Ken Clarke, the veteran Tory (now independent) MP and leader of the Commons, asks Johnson for an assurance that the HS2 review will consider the impact of cancelling the plan on the East Midlands, Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire. Johnson says he can give that assurance. Anna Soubry, the Independent Group for Change MP, says there was no mention of HS2 in the budget. Johnson says the government is committed to infrastructure spending. On HS2, he says there will be more on this in the budget. Johnson says it is time to get Brexit done. He says Brexit will allow the UK to get life-saving medicines to market more quickly and more cheaply. (This is not normally a point Johnson makes when itemising the supposed benefits of Brexit. Is it motivated by the need to match Labour\u2019s plan to reduce the cost of medicines?) Johnson says the destruction that Labour would do to business is the biggest threat this country faces \u2013 far bigger than the threat posed by a no-deal Brexit. Johnson says the government wants the economy to flourish because so many solutions to our problems are provided by the free market and capitalism. That is how the UK will become carbon neutral by 2050, he says. He says this is understood even by his \u201ccrusty\u201d relatives like his father, Stanley, who backed the Extinction Rebellion protests. Tom Brake, the Lib Dem Brexit spokesman, asks about the impact of Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal on manufacturing. Johnson says that is why the Lib Dems should vote for a deal. And he accuses Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, of going to Brussels for a meeting with Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, and asking him to rule out any deal. Johnson says Labour\u2019s plan to scrap Ofsted is \u201cinsane\u201d. He says that one nation Conservatives like himself support Ofsted because they believe in standards. Back in the debate Labour\u2019s Maria Eagle says Merseyside has lost 1,120 police officers. Why is it only being allowed to recruit 200 more. Johnson says this is just the first wave of recruitment. UPDATE: I\u2019ve corrected this because it was Maria Eagle who asked the question, not her identical twin sister Angela, as I originally wrote. From the Independent\u2019s John Rentoul Johnson says he wants to level up investment across the nation. He claims decisions now will lead to 40 new hospitals. (Actually, as this Full Fact briefing explains, six would be a more accurate figure.) Turning back to the issue of the prosecution of military veterans, Johnson says the government will legislate to ensure there is no unfair prosecution when no new evidence has been produced. The DUP\u2019s Sammy Wilson asks Johnson to assure him that he will not let the Northern Ireland Office include the IRA in any provisions. Johnson repeats the point he made originally. Johnson says Corbyn recently said he was daunted by the idea of becoming PM. Many other people feel the same way, he says. He says he personally will do all he can to stop this. He says his government will champion the free market. He says the mention of a free market has made John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, flinch \u201clike a Transylvanian in the sunlight\u201d. Bob Stewart, a Conservative, asks Johnson why there was no legislation in the speech to protect former members of the armed forces from being prosecuted over historical events. Johnson says the government is still consulting on this matter. It will bring forward legislation when it is ready, he says. And this is from the BBC\u2019s Ian Watson. From the Independent\u2019s Rob Merrick Johnson turns to Jeremy Corbyn, and he accuses Corbyn of changing his mind on an early election. He says Corbyn\u2019s policy on cake is neither having it nor eating it. And he jokes about the changes to Corbyn\u2019s inner circle. (See 9.58am.) John McDonnell is tightening his icy grip on the party, he says. Boris Johnson is speaking now. He starts with tributes to the MPs Lee Rowley and Sarah Newton. Rowley\u2019s aunt was secretary to Arthur Scargill, Johnson says. He also says Rowley collects airline memorabilia (which might not be something Rowley wanted everyone to know). Corbyn says there was no action on the climate in the speech. There is some truth in this. The speech includes an environment bill. This will codify carbon emission targets, but in his comment on this bill in his introduction to the Queen\u2019s speech briefing pack (pdf), Boris Johnson focused on what the bill would do for animal welfare (a priority for his partner Carrie Symonds, who campaigns on this topic). Johnson said: The huge star of our legislative programme is a momentous new environment bill \u2013 a lodestar by which we will guide our country towards a cleaner and greener future. This legislation takes forward the work of my predecessor, and will set a framework of legally binding targets to reduce plastics, restore biodiversity and clean up our water and air. And demonstrating that the British really are a nation of animal lovers we will take steps to strengthen animal welfare. Corbyn says Boris Johnson needs to assure EU nationals living in this country that their right to stay in the UK will be guaranteed. Corbyn turns to the government\u2019s plans to require people to show photo ID when they vote. We will not allow this government to stifle democracy by making it harder for people to vote \u2013 there was only one instance of voter personation at the last election. Eleven million in this country don\u2019t have a passport or driving licence. There are huge risks in such legislation, which will disproportionately affect working class, ethnic minority and young voters. Labour\u2019s Angela Eagle asks Corbyn if this is an attempt to suppress voter turnout amongst certain groups (groups likely to vote for Labour). Corbyn agrees. Corbyn says the speech does nothing for bus services. He says most tower blocks with Grenfell-style cladding have not had it removed. On crime, Corbyn says: The dog-whistle rhetoric around foreign offenders is a rather ugly mask for the fact that by crashing out of the EU this government risks losing some of the most effective measures in tackling cross-border crime: the European arrest warrant, participation in Eurojust and access to numerous databases. And he expresses scepticism about the plans for railways. We will study the detail closely of the government\u2019s proposals on rail reform but it is no good simply changing the way in which train operating companies carry on extracting profit from our fragmented railway system. Only a Labour government will cap fares and ensure the railway is run for passengers not for profit. Corbyn says the government should repeal the Health and Social Care Act and end privatisation in the NHS. He says the government should match Labour\u2019s pledge to have safe staffing levels in hospitals. He says the speech was shockingly weak on school funding. The extra money for schools will not compensate for what has been lost since 2010, he says. Corbyn welcomes the proposal in the Queen\u2019s speech to ensure employers pass on tips. Unions have been calling for this for ages, he says. But he says the government should go further and implement the proposals outlined by Laura Pidcock, the shadow business minister, in her speech to the TUC last month. (It has been reported that Pidcock is now the candidate favoured by Corbynites for next Labour leader. This afternoon\u2019s name check will do nothing to dispel that theory.) Corbyn says the country has almost got a lost generation. He challenges the PM to match Labour\u2019s proposals on welfare. So will the prime minister match Labour\u2019s commitments to scrap the benefit freeze, end the benefit cap, ditch the bedroom tax, scrap the two-child limit and the rape clause, and end punitive sanctions? Corbyn turns to poverty. There was nothing in this Queen\u2019s speech to address our stagnant economy. Nothing to address low pay and insecure work. Nothing to reverse rising levels of child poverty or pensioner poverty. Corbyn has not even got to the end of his speech, but Labour has already put it out on Twitter. Corbyn says we could be only weeks away from a Labour Queen\u2019s speech. Patrick McLoughlin, the former Tory chairman, says if Labour had voted for an election in September, the Queen could have been reading out a Labour one. Why did Corbyn not back an election? Because we don\u2019t trust the prime minster, says Corbyn. Corbyn is now on to the substance of his speech. He says there has never been such a \u201cfarce\u201d as a government with a majority of minus 45, and a 100% record of being defeated in the Commons, setting out a programme for government. Jeremy Corbyn is speaking now. He starts by paying tribute to Paul Flynn, the Labour MP who died earlier this year. He says Lee Rowley and Sarah Newton both started in local government. He pays tribute to councillors, and says they should be seen as an important part of our democracy. As is traditional on these occasions, he praises the two MPs who proposed and seconded the loyal address. He jokes about Rowley being a surprise choice for the role because Rowley has not always got on with Boris Johnson, he claims. He says when Johnson was mayor of London, Rowley was a councillor, and proposed a nightlife tax. Johnson was furious, Corbyn says. He says the plan only covered parking, but he suggests Johnson saw it as an incursion on his own nightlife activities. Newton is now addressing Europe. It has been tough going, she says. This week MPs must redouble their efforts, compromise and find a consensus on the way forward. She jokes about various songs MPs could sing to bring them together over Brexit, ending with the Beatles\u2019 We Can Work it Out. As she sits down she gets a pat on the back from Theresa May, who is sitting beside her. Sarah Newton, the MP for Truro and Falmouth, a former disabilities minister, is seconding the loyal address. She is on a different wing of the Conservative party on Brexit. She resigned as a minister earlier this year so that she could vote to rule out a no-deal Brexit. She starts by saying she was a bit worried to get this slot. She hopes the best days of her career are not over, she says. Rowley recalls a visit to parliament when he was at school, when he was shown around by the late Tony Benn. He recalls Benn running through his five questions that should be asked of anyone in power. After a jokey introduction, Lee Rowley gets into the meat of his speech. He says the country is divided. He says he has been \u201crobust\u201d in his criticism of previous Brexit deals. But now is the time to take a decision, he says. He says he hopes that there will be light at the end of the tunnel this week. In my view, we simply must get Brexit done. He says it is time for MPs to get back to the country\u2019s other priorities. Hardline Tory Brexiter Lee Rowley suggests he would vote for Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal, saying \u201cwe simply must get Brexit done\u201d. Before the prime minister and the leader of the opposition speak, two backbenchers propose and second the loyal address (the thank you note to the Queen - see 10.36am) By tradition, one of them is a young, up-and-coming MP, and the other is a veteran. Lee Rowley, MP for North East Derbyshire, is proposing the loyal address. He was only elected in 2017, and he is 39. Rowley is one of the 28 \u201cSpartans\u201d - hardline Tory Brexiters who voted against Theresa May\u2019s deal three times. You can see why No 10 might be keen to humour him at the moment ... In the Commons the sitting has resumed. As is normal at the start of a new parliamentary session, John Bercow, the Speaker, reads out a statement reminding MPs of their duties under the code of conduct and asserting the rights of the Commons. Here is an extract from the version he read out at the start of the session in 2017. I begin by reminding members of our duty to observe the code of conduct agreed by the House, and to behave with civility and fairness in all their dealings. In our proceedings, every member should be heard courteously, whatever their views. The house asserts its privilege of freedom of speech so that we can represent our constituents without fear or favour. We must exercise that privilege responsibly. It applies only to our work in this House; as private individuals we are equal under the law with those whom we represent. Here is some reaction to the Queen\u2019s speech from opposition parties. From Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary From Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary From Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster Boris Johnson\u2019s toxic Tory agenda would be devastating for Scotland - ripping us out of the EU, single market and customs union against our will, destroying jobs, and inflicting lasting harm on living standards, public services and the economy. The Tory leader\u2019s time is up. The SNP will do everything we can over the coming days to bring this failed Tory government to an end - and prevent it imposing its tired, damaging policies, including by opposing this hijacked Queen\u2019s Speech if it ever comes to a vote. From the Liberal Democrats From Liz Saville Roberts, the Plaid Cymru leader at Wesminster Fundamentally calling for an election whilst at the same time outlining a year-long \u2013 or perhaps multi-year \u2013 programme of legislation is completely non-sensical. From the Green MP Caroline Lucas From the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg The Evening Standard\u2019s Nicholas Cecil has another clue (possibly) as to whether or not the DUP might support the Brexit backstop alternative being considered by the UK and the EU. And here is an extract from Cecil\u2019s story. DUP Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson, when asked about Commons Leader Jacob Rees-Mogg saying is willing to \u201ceat his own words\u201d and back a customs plan he once branded \u201ccompletely cretinous\u201d, responded: \u201cWhatever appetite he has for his own words or whatever, we will not be eating our own words. Our position is clear, the government knows what our position is and we will not be dining from a different menu.\u201d The former head of the civil service, Andrew Turnbull, has launched an attack on unelected Downing Street special advisers such as Dominic Cummings, warning that damage is being inflicted on the functioning of government. In a thinly veiled attack on Boris Johnson\u2019s top adviser, the former cabinet secretary to Tony Blair said the rising concentration of power at No 10 needed to be reversed urgently if the country wanted better political decisions to be made. Speaking at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research in London, he said: What has happened is an accretion of power around the prime minister and the special adviser group around the prime minister, and it works to the detriment of Whitehall and of departments as a whole. Saying that both Jeremy Hunt and Sajid Javid had been circumvented by Theresa May and Boris Johnson in turn, he said the marginalisation of ministers had damaged the country at large. We\u2018ve got to go back to a view that the prime minister\u2019s senior adviser on any policy issue is his secretary of state. The prime minister must not get to thinking that all announcements have to come out of No 10. When they [special advisers] start to suppress and supplant the advice of the civil service, then they are beginning to do damage. And I think reversing this accretion of power that\u2019s happened over the past 20 years - pretty dramatic under Mrs May, is even more dramatic under the present prime minister - that is essential to get back to much better quality of policymaking. Also speaking at the event as the focus in Westminster shifted to the Queen\u2019s speech, Sir Jeremy Greenstock, Britain\u2019s former ambassador to the UN, warned that the UK\u2019s position on the world stage had been damaged by Brexit. Urging the government to redouble its efforts and to raise military spending to offset the hit to Britain\u2019s status, he said: We\u2019ve fallen back in international esteem and we\u2019ve lost an awful lot of ground. The UK and the EU have to work very closely together to be relevant globally. The US-UK relationship will not be secondary to that, but it will not substitute that. Any government leadership post Brexit has got to be very clear on that point. He said government spending on defence as a proportion of the economy should rise from 2% at present to 2.2%, adding: \u201cWe must bring something to the table or people will not be talking to us as we have taken ourselves out.\u201d Nicola Sturgeon has said she tries to avoid \u201cstressing and worrying\u201d about the potential impact of the Alex Salmond trial on her life, telling an interviewer \u201cwhat will be will be\u201d. Salmond, her predecessor as first minister and mentor, is expected to stand trial early next year for alleged sex offences, which he has repeatedly denied. He was charged in January with 14 offences including two of attempted rape, with senior Scottish National party figures expected to be called to give evidence. In an interview with Holyrood magazine to mark Scottish National party conference, Sturgeon said she was focusing on her work as first minister and party leader. She said: In terms of any trial, I don\u2019t spend much time thinking about it. I\u2019m not in control of it; I\u2019m not controlling the timing of it. I\u2019m not in control of the outcome, I\u2019m not in control of any aspect of it and I guess the longer anybody is in politics and in positions of leadership, one of the things you learn is not to spend too much time stressing about the things you\u2019re not in control of because there\u2019s plenty of things you are in control of to focus on. So I won\u2019t spend a lot of time stressing or worrying about it. What will be will be and around that I would say that I can\u2019t, and I won\u2019t go, into any detail or substance on it because I am not going to prejudice a process that should be respected. And I would simply caution others to take the same view and you know, not listen too much to the kind of gossip that swirls around in that kind of vacuum. Sturgeon, her senior aides and the head of the Scottish civil service, Leslie Evans, are also the focus of a Scottish parliament investigation into the devolved government\u2019s botched internal inquiry into allegations of inappropriate conduct by Salmond involving two female employees. Salmond denied those claims and won a civil action against Evans last August, when the Scottish government admitted it has mishandled that inquiry. The senior officer Evans appointed to run it had had contact with both women before they had formally lodged complaints. It then emerged Sturgeon had contact with Salmond five times last year, after the inquiry was launched, including three face to face meetings where he is thought to have lobbied her about the civil service inquiry. The BBC\u2019s Faisal Islam reckons there is only one reference to a no-deal Brexit in the 130-page Queen\u2019s speech briefing pack. Scotland\u2019s environment and climate change secretary, Roseanna Cunningham, has launched a vigorous attack on the Scottish Green party, claiming the Greens could not be trusted after their MSPs \u201csat on their hands\u201d during a recent vote on climate policy. The pro-independence Scottish Green party are the Scottish National party\u2019s erstwhile allies in the independence movement; its six MSPs have given Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s minority government a narrow majority at Holyrood in key votes on the constitution. Many observers believe the Scottish Greens\u2019 head count at Holyrood after the next Scottish parliamentary election in May 2021 could be crucial in ensuring pro-independence parties have a majority \u2013 assuming Sturgeon fails to hold a fresh referendum next year as she hopes. But in a combative speech at SNP conference in Aberdeen, Cunningham urged SNP members and pro-independence voters not to \u201clend their votes\u201d to the Scottish Greens at a Holyrood election, accusing them of siding with Labour and the Tories. Sturgeon\u2019s new climate strategy, to reach net zero by 2045, scraped through Holyrood last week after her government accepted a Labour amendment, which the Scottish Greens voted against because it was not ambitious enough. Cunningham told delegates: The people of Scotland know who they can trust to provide leadership. They can\u2019t trust Labour. And they certainly can\u2019t trust the Tories. Both parties will the ends, but never the means. Last week they had their chance to step up to the plate and they failed. And people can\u2019t trust the Greens either. At this crucial moment in Scotland\u2019s climate change journey, when it came time to pass those targets into law, they sat on their hands. So conference, let me offer this advice to you, and to every member of the SNP. Lend your vote to the Greens? So they can sit on their hands in the face of world leading ambition? I don\u2019t think so! The enmity on this seems to be mutual. With the Scottish Greens holding their annual conference in Inverness at the weekend, the party accused the SNP on Sunday of \u201cworld class hypocrisy\u201d after the former SNP climate minister Stewart Stevenson told an SNP fringe event sponsored by BP there would be decades more oil extraction. Here is a Guardian video of the Dennis Skinner heckle. By his standards, it was rather low-key. In an article for BuzzFeed Alex Wickham and Alberto Nardelli suggest No 10 is mulling over whether it could accept a Brexit extension to bolt down the details of the new backstop plan being considered by the UK and the EU \u2013 justifying this on the grounds that in spirit Brexit would have been delivered by the end of October. They write: One option under consideration in Number 10 is that, if the EU accepted in principle Johnson\u2019s customs partnership for the Northern Ireland proposal without a backstop, but said it needed more time to iron out the details, Johnson could agree to a three-month technical extension to Article 50. Some senior Tories believe that Johnson could present this outcome to the public as the prime minister successfully \u201cgetting Brexit done\u201d by October 31, with a deal agreed in principle and the backstop removed. A technical extension would be used to negotiate the final details and the UK would formally leave at a later date. The downside to this would be that the UK will not have legally left the EU on October 31, contrary to the public position of Johnson and Cummings. In this scenario, a general election could be delayed until 2020, also contrary to Johnson and Cummings\u2019 original plan. There are rising fears among senior ministers that the Conservatives would be squeezed by Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit Party in a pre-Brexit election. At the No 10 lobby briefing the PM\u2019s spokesman played down this suggestion (see 11.27am) and said Johnson was clear that the UK would be leaving the EU on 31 October. The government\u2019s Queen\u2019s speech briefing pack (pdf), in the section on the EU (withdrawal agreement) bill, says one of the main benefits of the bill would be ensuring the UK leaves the EU with a deal on 31 October. But it is worth noting that the Queen herself, in her speech, did not commit to hitting the 31 October deadline. She just said: My government\u2019s priority has always been to secure the United Kingdom\u2019s departure from the European Union on 31 October. The Queen\u2019s speech is drafted by the government, but the palace is consulted and presumably the Queen\u2019s aides would have been unhappy about her stating as fact that the UK would be leaving on 31 October when at the moment that is only an aspiration. She is more scrupulous about sticking to what\u2019s true than her prime minister. Here is an extract from Boris Johnson\u2019s statement about the Queen\u2019s speech in his introduction to the Queen\u2019s speech briefing pack (pdf). As befits a former motoring correspondent of GQ, he uses a driving metaphor \u2013 promising to \u201cget the gears on our national gearbox working again\u201d. This Queen\u2019s speech delivers on my promise as prime minister to get this amazing country of ours moving again. People are tired of stasis, gridlock and waiting for change. They don\u2019t want to wait for improvements in their hospitals. They don\u2019t want to wait for their streets to be made safer. They don\u2019t want to wait for their schools to have the funding they need to give their children the superb education they deserve. And they don\u2019t want to wait any longer to get Brexit done and to answer that clarion call of 17.4m people in the greatest exercise of democracy in our national history. So we are going to get the gears on our national gearbox working again. Leaving the EU is a defining opportunity for us to set a new course and a new direction for our country \u2013 to do the things we have not been allowed to for decades, to tear away that bureaucratic red tape, to set our own rules, and to release the talent, creativity, innovation and chutzpah that exists in every corner of our United Kingdom. It is striking how, despite being one of the architects of the vote to leave the EU, Johnson is now desperate to move beyond the \u201cgridlock\u201d that the referendum result engendered. In his statement, Johnson also revives a line that he used during his speech to the Tory conference. He says: If there is one great British institution that has the emotional force to bring our country together, it is our NHS. It is sacred in our nation precisely because at its heart is the simple beauty of the principle that whoever you are, no matter where you come from, if you fall sick the whole country gathers figuratively at your bedside. (You can see why Johnson is taken by the metaphor, but I\u2019m not sure it works. Personally, if I were in hospital, the last thing I would want would be the whole nation by my bedside.) I missed this moment earlier ... The government has now published its 130-page Queen\u2019s speech briefing pack (pdf). This includes a statement by the prime minister, the full text of the Queen\u2019s speech (always the most boring speech delivered by anyone during the political calendar \u2013 it is basically just a list), and briefing notes on all the government bills being planned. Here is my colleague Peter Walker\u2019s story about the Queen\u2019s speech. And this is how it starts. The government has announced a proposed legislative programme dominated by post-Brexit bills and a renewed focus on law and order in an unusual Queen\u2019s speech, one mainly used by Boris Johnson as a preview of the Conservatives\u2019 election manifesto. The summary of planned new laws read out by the Queen to mark the new session of parliament contained 26 new or returning bills, more than a third of which relate to new arrangements following departure from the EU. Other key elements of a speech widely trailed in advance included plans for tougher jail sentences and controversial proposals to oblige people to show photographic ID before they are allowed to vote. Back to Brexit, and at the European commission\u2019s daily briefing the commission\u2019s spokeswoman, Mina Andreeva, got sidetracked into musing about lighting effects when responding to a question about progress in the Brexit talks. Asked about \u201clight at the end of the tunnel\u201d and whether the light was \u201cstatic\u201d or \u201capproaching\u201d, she replied: I\u2019m really not a technician in light bulbs or light effects. Maybe it could be a flashing light, because sometimes it\u2019s stronger, sometimes it\u2019s less strong. So let\u2019s see what kind of light we will see at the end. Hopefully there will be light indeed. From Jack McConnell, a Labour peer She says the union is of the utmost importance to the government. Steps will be taken to protect the integrity of democracy, she says. The government will maintain defence spending at 2% of GDP. And the UK will continue to play a leading role in global affairs, she says. She tells MPs that estimates (measures that decide how government money is spent) will be presented to them. And \u201cother measures\u201d will be introduced during the session, she says. And that\u2019s it. The Queen says the government is committed to the environment. There will be measures to improve air and water quality, and to promote the welfare of animals. Trophy hunting will be banned. The Queen says the government wants everyone to have access to an excellent education. There will be measures to help those working hard. A national infrastructure strategy will bring the benefits of a prospering economy to every corner of the kingdom, she says. Legislation will ensure the delivery of fast, reliable broadband to millions of homes. There will be an aviation bill, and proposals on railway reform. She says the government\u2019s new economic plan will be underpinned by a new fiscal strategy. There will be measures to strengthen the NHS, she says. There will also be plans to reform adult social care. She says the government is committed to addressing violent crime. New sentencing laws will be introduced, she says. And measures will improve the handling of foreign national offenders. There will be measures to improve prison safety and to help victims. Public sector bodies will be under a duty to address serious violence. There will also be laws to help the victims of domestic abuse and to minimise the impact of divorce. The Queen starts by saying the government\u2019s priority \u201chas always been to secure the United Kingdom\u2019s departure from the European Union on 31 October\u201d. She says the government wants a new partnership with the EU, based on free trade. There will be new regimes for fisheries and agriculture. An immigration bill, ending free movement, will be introduced. And steps will be taken to deliver stability in financial services, she says. Robert Buckland, the lord chancellor, gives the Queen the text of the speech to read out. The Mirror\u2019s Kevin Maguire heard what Dennis Skinner said. Black Rod is entering the Commons. She tells the Speaker the Queen has commanded MPs to attend her in the House of Lords. Dennis Skinner, the Labour MP famous for heckling Black Rod at this point in the ceremony, expresses some sort of dissent, but from the TV coverage it is hard to hear what he said. Downing Street has expressed scepticism at the idea the UK could part-exit the EU on 31 October \u2013 agreeing a deal to satisfy political demand while allowing a \u201ctechnical extension\u201d for details to be finalised. Asked about the idea, which would allow Boris Johnson to reach an interim agreement at the European council summit this week while giving more time for parliament and the EU to approve it, Johnson\u2019s spokesman said: \u201cIt\u2019s news to me that something like that is even possible.\u201d Asked if Downing Street would thus not agree such a plan even if it was mooted, the spokesman said: The prime minister has been clear on many occasions that we are going to leave on 31 October. There was also little news on negotiations to even reach a deal at the summit in Brussels this Wednesday and Thursday. \u201cTalks remain constructive but there is a lot of work still to do,\u201d Johnson\u2019s spokesman said. The prime minister currently has no calls with EU leaders scheduled, despite reports he was due to talk to people including Angela Merkel. If a deal was reached, he said, MPs would be expected to \u201cwork around the clock\u201d to get it through parliament in time. However, as yet it is not confirmed whether the Commons will definitely sit on Saturday, as mooted, to either agree a deal or decide on a possible extension, as dictated under the so-called Benn act. A motion to sit on Saturday would need to be tabled on Wednesday for a vote of MPs on Thursday, the spokesman said. The Queen is now on the throne in the Lords. But MPs are still in the Commons. They now need to be summoned by Black Rod. Back to Brexit, and measures to manage traffic on Kent\u2019s motorways in preparation for a possible no-deal Brexit will be implemented on 28 October, the Department for Transport has announced. The transport minister Chris Heaton-Harris said travellers also needed to \u201cdo their bit\u201d. He said: We want residents in Kent and hauliers travelling from across the EU to be reassured that there are robust plans in place to deal with any disruption in the event of a no-deal Brexit. We now need everyone to do their bit. Whether you are travelling to see family, heading to work or transporting vital goods around the country, please check before you travel to ensure you know what to expect and have the right documents when heading to the border. These are from the Mirror\u2019s Pippa Crerar, who has been at the Downing Street lobby briefing. In the Commons John Bercow, the Speaker, is taking his seat ahead of the state opening ceremony. The Queen has arrived at parliament for the Queen\u2019s speech. This morning Sajid Javid, the chancellor, announced that he plans to hold a budget on 6 November, less than a week after the date of the UK\u2019s supposed exit from the EU. But the small print of the government\u2019s announcement makes it clear that, if there were a no-deal Brexit on 31 October, the budget would be delayed. It says: The government is committed to securing a deal and leaving on 31 October. In the event of no deal, the government would act quickly to outline our approach and take early action to support the economy, businesses and households. This would be followed by a budget in the weeks thereafter. On the Today programme Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, said this was an example of the government \u201cmaking things up as they go along\u201d. I have to say, I think it\u2019s another example of this government making things up as they go along. I\u2019m not sure they will still be in office on November 6. It doesn\u2019t appear to be at all certain we will leave the EU on October 31. It\u2019s still a big risk of leaving with no deal, but I certainly hope that we will manage to see an extension secured to the article 50 process. The Mail on Sunday\u2019s Dan Hodges thinks this is an implicit acknowledgement that there will be a Brexit extension. From HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh Boris Johnson\u2019s hopes of getting a new Brexit deal through parliament depend to a large extend on the 10 Democratic Unionist party MPs. That is not necessarily because those votes are essential \u2013 if Johnson could win over a significant number of Labour MPs, he could make up for those lost 10 votes \u2013 so much as the fact the DUP support would help to unlock a chunk of hardline Tory Brexiter support. There were 28 Tory Brexiters who voted against Theresa May\u2019s deal three times, partly because of its impact on the union, but they would find it hard to object to a Johnson deal on unionist grounds if the DUP was in favour. As Rory Carroll reported over the weekend, the DUP\u2019s response to the plan currently being explored by the UK and the EU has been non-committal. This morning there is new evidence that the DUP may be turning against what is being proposed. An Irish Times story quotes the DUP MP Jim Shannon saying anything that does not treat Northern Ireland the same as England would be unacceptable. Shannon said: It is simple. Are we being treated the same as England? No, we are not. Therefore, if we are not being treated the same as England, then we are not going to accept it. We don\u2019t know the full details of the latest plan, but everything we have been told about it says it does not treat Northern Ireland in the same way as England. Simon Coveney, the Irish foreign minister and deputy prime minister, said this morning that a Brexit deal \u201cmay ... be possible this week\u201d ahead of a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Luxembourg. But he also said it was important to be cautious. Speaking to reporters, he said: On Brexit, the less we say now the better. But we need to give time and space to Michel Barnier [the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator] and his taskforce and the British negotiating team. I think it\u2019s pretty clear what we\u2019re trying to do, but there are pretty detailed technical discussions now and I think we need to give the time and space for that to happen. Hopefully we can make progress today on those. He went on: The message I would give is that we need to be cautious. This is not an easy job. We\u2019ve spent three years trying to get an agreement between the two sides and have made progress at different times. But certainly the last number of months have been difficult. So I think, as my taoiseach has said, a deal is possible, and it\u2019s possible this month, may even be possible this week. But we\u2019re not there yet. And, as Michel Barnier said yesterday, there\u2019s still a lot of work to do, so I hope that we can make more progress today. Our priority is to try to provide certainty to so many people who are awaiting a Brexit outcome and to do that as soon as possible. Here is a question from below the line. What happens if the government loses the vote on the Queen\u2019s speech? Before the Fixed-term Parliaments Act was passed in 2011, the Queen\u2019s speech vote counted as a confidence matter and a government that lost was expected to resign. That is what happened in 1886, 1892 and 1924. Those votes all took place after general elections, and on each occasion a new administration took power without another election being called. The last election was more than two years ago and, if the FTPA was not on the statute book, you would expect Boris Johnson to respond to a defeat on the Queen\u2019s speech by calling an election. But, of course, that is not an option for him. Under the FTPA a government motion for an early election would need the support of two thirds of MPs in the Commons for it to have force, and Johnson has failed twice to get a motion passed meeting that threshold. If Johnson does lose the vote, he might try again to force an early election. He could table a confidence motion in his own government (although it is hard to see what this would achieve), or he could table a no confidence motion and ask his MPs to abstain (because if a no confidence motion gets passed, and no other administration takes over within 14 days, an election has to happen under the FTPA). As well as being risky, this would be seen as an abuse of process and, although theoretically possible, it is possible that it could be disallowed by the Speaker. But Johnson could also just ignore a vote against the Queen\u2019s speech. A defeat like that would not stop him governing; it would not be like a vote against the budget, which would stop the government raising taxes. At the end of the Queen\u2019s speech all MPs are actually voting on is a motion saying they should send a humble address to the Queen thanking her for attending parliament. If Johnson loses the vote, all that technically happens is that the Queen does not get the note. One less thing to read. She probably wouldn\u2019t mind ... UPDATE: David Howarth, a Cambridge law professor and former Lib Dem MP, has been in touch to say losing a vote on the Queen\u2019s speech does have at least one practical effect. He explains: You might be interested to know that there would be a practical consequence for the government of losing the motion on the address completely (as opposed to losing on an amendment to it). Standing order 51 says that the government can\u2019t move a ways and means resolution without notice unless the address has been agreed to. What this means is that if the government fails to get the address through the house, it can\u2019t bring in emergency tax changes, e.g. to beat avoidance schemes, without letting the world know first, which might be very inconvenient in current circumstances. Perhaps more important, that standing order could be amended by the house to say that the government can\u2019t bring in a budget at all until the address has been passed, something it might do if Boris Johnson loses a vote on the Queen\u2019s speech and then refuses to follow the convention that prime ministers defeated on the Queen\u2019s speech should resign. From Bloomberg\u2019s Brexit correspondent Ian Wishart A number of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s staff are fearing for their jobs after 37 members of his team were summoned to \u201cinformal meetings\u201d this week as part of a major shake-up of the Labour leader\u2019s operation, Sky\u2019s Tom Rayner is reporting. Boris Johnson has been photographed getting a flu jab in Downing Street. He will be standing in a very crowded House of Lords a bit later, so I suppose there\u2019s no knowing what you might catch ... There was once a time when the trendy new journalistic medium was the live blog, but now it is the Twitter thread. Here are three from last night from specialist Brussels watchers which are all worth reading if you are interested in the state of the Brexit talks. My colleague Jennifer Rankin has a thread starting here. And here is her conclusion. RT\u00c9\u2019s Tony Connelly has a thread starting here. And Mujtaba Rahman from the Eurasia Group consultancy has a thread starting here. TF50 is Taskforce 50, the EU\u2019s Brexit negotiating team. Rahman has also posted this this morning. EUCO is the European council \u2013 the body comprising EU heads of government holding a summit starting on Thursday. When the Labour party has to decide what is going to be in its election manifesto, it holds what\u2019s called a clause V meeting, where the shadow cabinet, the national executive committee and assorted union leaders thrash things out over the course of a day. It is the ultimate \u201csmoke-filled room\u201d, although of course these days there\u2019s no smoke. The Conservatives do things differently, but even the party traditionally associated with the monarchy has probably never held a manifesto event quite like this - the Queen reading out 20-odd legislative proposals from the throne in the House of Lords, addressing hundreds of peers dressed in ermine, with MPs standing at the back. Parliament normally holds a Queens\u2019s speech every year, setting out the legislative programme for the following 12 months, but Boris Johnson\u2019s government has no majority and it has no prospect of being able to pass most of the measures being announced this morning. In fact, this could become the first Queen\u2019s speech to be voted down for almost 100 years. The opposition have said that, in practice, today is all about showcasing a Conservative policy platform for the election, and it is hard to disagree. This is how Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, put it in a statement last night. This Queen\u2019s speech is farcical. It is just an uncosted wish list which the government has no intention and no means to deliver, and nothing more than a pre-election party political broadcast. Here is our overnight preview story. Normally the Queen\u2019s speech is the main event of the day. But, as ever, Brexit eclipses everything, and if there is any news from Brussels today about the progress of the talks, that will overshadow anything said at Westminster. As of last night, the negotiations had still failed to achieve a breakthrough. Here is our summary. Here is the agenda for the day. 11am: Roseanna Cunningham, Scotland\u2019s environment secretary, addresses the Scottish National party conference. Other speakers at the conference are Derek Mackay, the finance secretary, at 12.15pm, and John Swinney, the deputy first minister, at 3.25pm. 11.25am: The state opening of parliament, with the Queen\u2019s speech. 2.30pm: MPs begin the debate on the Queen\u2019s speech. After a statement from the Speaker, John Bercow, and speeches from two backbenchers, Jeremy Corbyn and Boris Johnson will deliver the main opening speeches. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, although mostly I will be focusing on Brexit and the Queen\u2019s speech. I plan to publish a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

      "bodyText": "The government is likely to be able to recoup \u00a31m at most from bonuses paid to the executives who were in charge of Thomas Cook when it failed. MPs on the business, energy and industrial strategy (BEIS) select committee will question former directors of Thomas Cook on Tuesday, in the first session of an inquiry into one of the most high-profile failures in UK corporate history. They are expected to ask directors whether they feel they should give back some of the multimillion pound pay packets they were awarded for running the company in its final years. The company\u2019s last three chief executives were paid \u00a335m between them in the 12 years leading up to the tour operator\u2019s collapse, while board members were handed \u00a320m in bonuses alone during the past five years. But the Guardian understands that any repayment is likely to be a small fraction of that, due in part to a two-year limit on the \u201cclawback\u201d powers written into the contract of directors, if they are deemed responsible for the firm\u2019s financial downturn. Peter Fankhauser was paid \u00a38.4m during his tenure as chief executive at Thomas Cook, including \u00a34.6m in bonuses, but the majority was paid in shares that he did not sell and are now worthless. Of the remainder, only one year\u2019s cash bonus falls within the two-year clawback limit, meaning the maximum he could be forced to return is \u00a3558,000. The same applies to former finance director Michael Healy, who could only be forced to give back \u00a3465,000, a combined total of just over \u00a31m. That is less than the \u00a31.5m than the Civil Aviation Authority is understood to have collected from Thomas Cook for providing advisors in the year leading up to its failure. The government\u2019s Official Receiver managing Thomas Cook\u2019s liquidation does have powers to reclaim sums paid before the clawback period but would have to prove serious misconduct. That means the government is unlikely to be able to reclaim \u00a3561,000 in cash bonuses that Fankhauser received in the two years prior to the limit, while the same applies to Healy, who could keep \u00a3484,000 in cash. The time limit also means there is little chance of the Official Receiver reclaiming money from the firm\u2019s previous two bosses, Harriet Green and Manny Fontenla-Novoa, paid more than \u00a327m between them. Directors appearing on Tuesday are expected to express contrition for their role in the company\u2019s demise. They are also expected to say that a financial rescue plan, dubbed \u201cProject Avenue\u201d, could have worked if the government had agreed to invest in the company on commercial terms. They will claim that the Department for Transport\u2019s lack of support sealed the fate of the company. Investment firm Triton Partners is in talks to buy Thomas Cook\u2019s Nordic operations, Sky News reported, raising hopes that more jobs can be saved. The tour operator\u2019s one-time rival Hays Travel bought its 555 high street travel agents last week and said it wanted to employ 2,500 former staff.",

Farrow\u2019s new book, Catch and Kill: Lies, Spies, and a Conspiracy to Protect Predators, is published in the US on Tuesday. The author alleges that NBC knew about Lauer\u2019s alleged behavior, including the alleged rape of Brooke Nevils in 2014 at the Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, and sought to cover it up. Farrow also alleges that his own reporting on the now disgraced film mogul Harvey Weinstein was quashed in order to protect Lauer. In an email to employees on Monday that was published by Deadline.com, the NBC News president, Noah Oppenheim, accused Farrow of taking the company\u2019s denial that it knew of Lauer\u2019s \u201cabhorrent\u201d actions and \u201ctwists it into a lie \u2013 alleging we were a \u2018company with a lot of secrets\u2019\u201d. \u201cWe have no secrets and nothing to hide,\u201d Oppenheim said. \u201cNot only is this false, the so-called evidence Farrow uses in his book to support the charge collapses under the slightest scrutiny,\u201d Oppenheim continued in the email.

She initially won her case at a first-tier immigration and asylum tribunal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/feb/12/derry-woman-us-born-husband-uk-emma-de-souza\">in February last year</a>, which ruled that under the terms of the Good Friday agreement the people of Northern Ireland had a unique right to identify in multiple ways.</p> <p>The Home Office won an appeal on Monday prompting a wave of local protests that nationality rights in the Good Friday agreement were not being recognised in British law.</p> <p>The judges, Justice Lane and Judge Rintoul, the president of the upper tribunal, concluded that by birth Emma DeSouza was British: \u201cAs a matter of law, Mrs DeSouza is at present a British citizen in the current time.\u201d</p> <p>In their <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/430189648/Jake-Parka-de-Souza-Emma-de-Souza-case-v-Home-Office\">ruling</a> Lane and Rintoul, said there was nothing in domestic legislation \u201cgiving effect\u201d to the peace deal.</p> <p> </p> <p>DeSouza vowed to keep fighting for her right to remain Irish without having to first renounce her British citizenship.

      "bodyText": "Ireland is to press the British government to review domestic laws on citizenship in Northern Ireland after a UK court ruled that people born in the region are legally British citizens even if they identify as Irish. Simon Coveney, the Irish foreign affairs minister, said he would raise the case of Emma DeSouza with the Northern Ireland secretary on Tuesday. He is concerned that British law is not \u201cconsistent\u201d with the unique rights enshrined in the Good Friday agreement peace deal that allow anyone born in Northern Ireland to be Irish, British or both. His intervention is not the first in the case of Emma and Jake DeSouza, who lost an immigration case in Belfast on Monday. US-born Jake DeSouza had applied for residency rights in Northern Ireland under EU freedom of movement rules that allow third country spouses of EU citizens to live with their husbands or wives in an EU member state without going through national immigration. The Home Office rejected the application on the grounds that it considered Emma DeSouza a British citizen, and said the only way it could deal with the case was for her to \u201crenounce her status as a British citizen\u201d. She argued that she was Irish, always carried an Irish passport and had the right to be legally recognised as Irish, albeit living in a UK jurisdiction. She initially won her case at a first-tier immigration and asylum tribunal in February last year, which ruled that under the terms of the Good Friday agreement the people of Northern Ireland had a unique right to identify in multiple ways. The Home Office won an appeal on Monday prompting a wave of local protests that nationality rights in the Good Friday agreement were not being recognised in British law. The judges, Justice Lane and Judge Rintoul, the president of the upper tribunal, concluded that by birth Emma DeSouza was British: \u201cAs a matter of law, Mrs DeSouza is at present a British citizen in the current time.\u201d In their ruling Lane and Rintoul, said there was nothing in domestic legislation \u201cgiving effect\u201d to the peace deal. DeSouza vowed to keep fighting for her right to remain Irish without having to first renounce her British citizenship. She said she was deeply disappointed by the decision that \u201cruled against the Good Friday Agreement\u201d and vowed to try to get a fresh hearing in the court of appeal. She said she was \u201cdeeply disheartened\u201d the tribunal ruled that she was a British citizen and that until she accepted this she could not access her rights as an Irish citizen and EU citizen in Northern Ireland. \u201cThis is not in line with the spirit, or the purpose or the intent of the Good Friday agreement,\u201d she said. The Irish Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said Ireland had amended its domestic law after the 1998 peace deal to deliver the agreed rights. Questions will now be asked as to why UK domestic law was not amended likewise. DeSouza had argued that she should not have to renounce her British citizenship, contending she never considered herself British and was entitled to identify as Irish under the GFA. The court\u2019s ruling centres on whether the tribunal had earlier made an error of law, not on whether the law delivered the Good Friday agreement or not. They found that international treaties such as the GFA were entered into under royal prerogative but that this prerogative did not extend to altering domestic law without the intervention of parliament. \u201cQuite simply, a treaty is not part of English law unless and until it has been incorporated into the law by legislation,\u201d the ruling said, and DeSouza or others could not derive rights or be denied rights by an international treaty. The Home Office said: \u201cThe Home Office is absolutely committed to upholding the Belfast [Good Friday] agreement. We respect the right of the people of Northern Ireland to choose to identify as British or Irish or both and their right to hold both British and Irish citizenship. \u201cWe are pleased that the upper tribunal agrees that UK nationality law is consistent with the Belfast agreement.\u201d",

That\u2019s no surprise. Independence is what the SNP is in business for. What is more, after 12 years of SNP rule and five years on from the 2014 referendum, Scots voters show little sign of tiring of the party. Conservative advances have ebbed since Ruth Davidson quit and Boris Johnson became prime minister. Scottish Labour remains in historic eclipse. The SNP is on course to recapture Westminster seats from both parties, while <a href=\"https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/17965228.support-scottish-independence-rises-50-according-new-poll/?ref=ebln\" title=\"\">a weekend poll</a> put support for independence at 50%, the highest figure in recent times.</p> <p>An imminent prospect of Brexit means a second independence referendum is once again a wholly live issue. Ms Sturgeon is expected to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/03/sturgeon-seek-legal-powers-hold-new-scottish-independence-referendum\" title=\"\">make a formal request</a> for a new vote to the UK government in the coming weeks. If there is an early general election, the indyref2 demand will be a central part of the campaign, with rival parties under pressure to define their positions. Labour, in particular, will be in the SNP\u2019s sights. Ms Sturgeon has said that, if there is another hung Westminster parliament, Jeremy Corbyn <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-50013578\" title=\"\">should not pick up the phone</a> to propose a parliamentary deal unless he is willing to agree to a second vote.

      "bodyText": "Nicola Sturgeon will put independence front and centre in her leader\u2019s speech to the SNP conference in Aberdeen on Tuesday. That\u2019s no surprise. Independence is what the SNP is in business for. What is more, after 12 years of SNP rule and five years on from the 2014 referendum, Scots voters show little sign of tiring of the party. Conservative advances have ebbed since Ruth Davidson quit and Boris Johnson became prime minister. Scottish Labour remains in historic eclipse. The SNP is on course to recapture Westminster seats from both parties, while a weekend poll put support for independence at 50%, the highest figure in recent times. An imminent prospect of Brexit means a second independence referendum is once again a wholly live issue. Ms Sturgeon is expected to make a formal request for a new vote to the UK government in the coming weeks. If there is an early general election, the indyref2 demand will be a central part of the campaign, with rival parties under pressure to define their positions. Labour, in particular, will be in the SNP\u2019s sights. Ms Sturgeon has said that, if there is another hung Westminster parliament, Jeremy Corbyn should not pick up the phone to propose a parliamentary deal unless he is willing to agree to a second vote. If the SNP gets the support that the polls currently suggest, her mandate to make that demand will be incontrovertible. That, though, is the relatively easy bit. Translating such a mandate into a successful independence campaign will be harder. If the UK leaves the European Union, Scotland\u2019s majority remain vote in 2016 will be viewed with deep sympathy in Brussels.

      "body": "<p>The Spanish supreme court\u2019s decision to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/14/catalan-separatist-leaders-given-lengthy-prison-sentences\" title=\"\">imprison nine</a> democrats and civil society leaders for organising a referendum on self-determination in Catalonia marks a new phase in the struggle for independence. Catalans have been calling on the government of Pedro S\u00e1nchez for more than a year to intervene, and attempt to bring about a peaceful resolution of the crisis. Monday\u2019s ruling is an escalation that will ignite anger right across the region.</p> <p>Answering the calls of extreme rightwing elements in Spain, the court imposed crushing prison terms on nine members of the government that I had the privilege to lead. I know these people well. They are dedicated democrats, committed to the cause of peaceful democratic change to Spain\u2019s fragile post-Franco constitution. They include the speaker of the Catalan parliament and the presidents of the two most important non-partisan civil society organisations, Omnium and the ANC. They are all pacifists and liberals.</p> <p>Some members of the government, including myself, decided to go into exile to escape the persecution, and to be able to defend the rights of Catalans more effectively. If we had remained in Spain, as this judgment proves, we too would have been subjected to an unfair trial by a politicised judiciary, prevented from refuting the false accusations against us. Instead, we have been given sanctuary in other European countries, and protected against Spain\u2019s attempts to extradite us from Belgium, Germany and Scotland. Applications for our extradition have been refused or abandoned because the allegations are recognised as purely political. Modern pluralistic democracies protect the right to political organisation and the right to peaceful political expression and association. Yet that is precisely what our nine colleagues have been imprisoned for. What Spain condemns, European democracy absolves.</p> <p>The actions of the Spanish state, its government and its judiciary strike at the heart of our democratic values at the very time that Europe needs them most. This can no longer be regarded as an internal matter for Spain, or even the institutions of the EU. It is an international concern. Earlier this year, the case of the Catalan political prisoners was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/29/carles-puigdemont-welcomes-un-panel-report-on-jailed-catalan-separatists\" title=\"\">brought to the United Nations</a> by an international legal team led by Ben Emmerson QC, a British international lawyer and former UN special rapporteur on human rights. In two carefully reasoned decisions, the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention held that the pre-trial imprisonment of the nine politicians was a violation of international law and a clear breach of Spain\u2019s legal obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. But the working group went further than that. It held that the imposition of any sentences of imprisonment at the end of the trial would violate international law. It called on Spain to release the prisoners immediately, and to conduct an independent investigation to identify those public officials responsible for the arbitrary detentions and to hold them accountable. The rule of law required no less.</p> <p>Instead of heeding that warning, the Spanish authorities set about disparaging the UN, accusing the working group of bias and challenging its decision. The supreme court proceeded to ignore the UN ruling and has now imposed sentences that are designed to crush the Catalan independence movement \u2013 to break the individuals who were before the court and to instil fear in the millions of people who support them. This is the reality of modern Spanish democracy.</p> <p>The supreme court <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-spain-politics-vox/spanish-far-right-vox-in-spotlight-in-catalan-trial-idUSKBN1QU269\" title=\"\">allowed</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/15/spanish-parties-far-right-vox-madrid\" title=\"\">Vox</a>, a neo-Francoist political party, to take an active part in the legal proceedings and to question the defendants personally. The extreme right in Spain correctly perceives Catalan independence parties as a threat. The political message throughout this process has been clear. This is the old Spain reasserting itself. Never truly committed to the human rights values of the Council of Europe and the European Union, dark forces have begun to assert themselves once more, with the full acquiescence of the government and the judiciary.</p> <p>The implications for democracy will be felt well outside Spain. In August, for instance, Turkey\u2019s minister of home affairs sought to justify the persecution of elected Kurdish officials by citing the Spanish government\u2019s actions against pro-independence politicians in Catalonia as a precedent. By turning a blind eye to the political repression in Catalonia, the EU has given succour to the Erdo\u011fan regime that at this very moment is killing civilians in north-eastern Syria.</p> <p>Two years have passed since the repression began, since the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/27/spanish-pm-mariano-rajoy-asks-senate-powers-dismiss-catalonia-president\" title=\"\">dissolution</a> of a democratically elected parliament and the dismissal by decree of a government with a parliamentary majority. In all this time, there has not been a single political proposal put forward by the Spanish government as a constructive alternative to the call for full independence. After four elections in as many years, the Spanish government is incapable of adopting a coherent political position, and instead is backing itself into an increasingly desperate corner.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/14/catalan-independence-what-is-the-story-what-happens-next\">What is the story of Catalan independence \u2013 and what happens next?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But despite the continuing persecution of the independence movement, the pro-independence parties in Catalonia gained an unprecedented level of support in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2019/may/26/eu-election-results-2019-across-europe\" title=\"\">European parliament elections</a> held in May this year. Over the course of two years of repression, with people in prison and exile, and citizens scared of the brute force of the state, the pro-independence movement has grown ever stronger at the ballot box. It is a movement that now goes far beyond its political leadership. It spans the whole of Catalan society, and is rooted in the liberal tradition of democratic radicalism.</p> <p>Monday\u2019s judgment is a condemnation not of the individual accused, but of more than 2 million people who made the referendum a reality. The decision to imprison the political leadership for giving effect to the democratic will of the Catalan people will inevitably backfire on Spain. There is now only one possible route that the Catalan nation can follow. If Catalonia is to survive and to protect its institutions and culture, it must now become an independent state in the form of a republic. We will never back down.</p> <p>\u2022 Carles Puigdemont i Casamaj\u00f3 is the former president of Catalonia</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Spanish supreme court\u2019s decision to imprison nine democrats and civil society leaders for organising a referendum on self-determination in Catalonia marks a new phase in the struggle for independence. Catalans have been calling on the government of Pedro S\u00e1nchez for more than a year to intervene, and attempt to bring about a peaceful resolution of the crisis. Monday\u2019s ruling is an escalation that will ignite anger right across the region. Answering the calls of extreme rightwing elements in Spain, the court imposed crushing prison terms on nine members of the government that I had the privilege to lead. I know these people well. They are dedicated democrats, committed to the cause of peaceful democratic change to Spain\u2019s fragile post-Franco constitution. They include the speaker of the Catalan parliament and the presidents of the two most important non-partisan civil society organisations, Omnium and the ANC. They are all pacifists and liberals. Some members of the government, including myself, decided to go into exile to escape the persecution, and to be able to defend the rights of Catalans more effectively. If we had remained in Spain, as this judgment proves, we too would have been subjected to an unfair trial by a politicised judiciary, prevented from refuting the false accusations against us. Instead, we have been given sanctuary in other European countries, and protected against Spain\u2019s attempts to extradite us from Belgium, Germany and Scotland. Applications for our extradition have been refused or abandoned because the allegations are recognised as purely political. Modern pluralistic democracies protect the right to political organisation and the right to peaceful political expression and association. Yet that is precisely what our nine colleagues have been imprisoned for. What Spain condemns, European democracy absolves. The actions of the Spanish state, its government and its judiciary strike at the heart of our democratic values at the very time that Europe needs them most. This can no longer be regarded as an internal matter for Spain, or even the institutions of the EU. It is an international concern. Earlier this year, the case of the Catalan political prisoners was brought to the United Nations by an international legal team led by Ben Emmerson QC, a British international lawyer and former UN special rapporteur on human rights. In two carefully reasoned decisions, the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention held that the pre-trial imprisonment of the nine politicians was a violation of international law and a clear breach of Spain\u2019s legal obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. But the working group went further than that. It held that the imposition of any sentences of imprisonment at the end of the trial would violate international law. It called on Spain to release the prisoners immediately, and to conduct an independent investigation to identify those public officials responsible for the arbitrary detentions and to hold them accountable. The rule of law required no less. Instead of heeding that warning, the Spanish authorities set about disparaging the UN, accusing the working group of bias and challenging its decision. The supreme court proceeded to ignore the UN ruling and has now imposed sentences that are designed to crush the Catalan independence movement \u2013 to break the individuals who were before the court and to instil fear in the millions of people who support them. This is the reality of modern Spanish democracy. The supreme court allowed Vox, a neo-Francoist political party, to take an active part in the legal proceedings and to question the defendants personally. The extreme right in Spain correctly perceives Catalan independence parties as a threat. The political message throughout this process has been clear. This is the old Spain reasserting itself. Never truly committed to the human rights values of the Council of Europe and the European Union, dark forces have begun to assert themselves once more, with the full acquiescence of the government and the judiciary. The implications for democracy will be felt well outside Spain. In August, for instance, Turkey\u2019s minister of home affairs sought to justify the persecution of elected Kurdish officials by citing the Spanish government\u2019s actions against pro-independence politicians in Catalonia as a precedent. By turning a blind eye to the political repression in Catalonia, the EU has given succour to the Erdo\u011fan regime that at this very moment is killing civilians in north-eastern Syria. Two years have passed since the repression began, since the dissolution of a democratically elected parliament and the dismissal by decree of a government with a parliamentary majority. In all this time, there has not been a single political proposal put forward by the Spanish government as a constructive alternative to the call for full independence. After four elections in as many years, the Spanish government is incapable of adopting a coherent political position, and instead is backing itself into an increasingly desperate corner. But despite the continuing persecution of the independence movement, the pro-independence parties in Catalonia gained an unprecedented level of support in the European parliament elections held in May this year. Over the course of two years of repression, with people in prison and exile, and citizens scared of the brute force of the state, the pro-independence movement has grown ever stronger at the ballot box. It is a movement that now goes far beyond its political leadership. It spans the whole of Catalan society, and is rooted in the liberal tradition of democratic radicalism. Monday\u2019s judgment is a condemnation not of the individual accused, but of more than 2 million people who made the referendum a reality. The decision to imprison the political leadership for giving effect to the democratic will of the Catalan people will inevitably backfire on Spain. There is now only one possible route that the Catalan nation can follow. If Catalonia is to survive and to protect its institutions and culture, it must now become an independent state in the form of a republic. We will never back down. \u2022 Carles Puigdemont i Casamaj\u00f3 is the former president of Catalonia",

      "bodyText": "Richard Curtis is nervous about the effect Netflix is having on Britishness. Speaking at the Cheltenham literature festival, he said the platform\u2019s campaign to buy up top British talent will lead to an artificial depiction of the country around the world. \u201cI worry that things are going to get bent away from what we know into a sort of slightly sanitised, cleaned up and commercialised version of what we view as that experience,\u201d he said. This \u2013 from Richard Curtis! The man whose entire cinematic output is about posh white people running through a twinkling picture-postcard fairyland, where British life is so sanitised and commercialised that it is roughly three buckets of fog and a plate of tripe away from being an exact reproduction of what Americans saw when they thought about London in the 50s. Not convinced? Here are four examples. Four Weddings and a Funeral Within the first two minutes of the 1994 romcom, a man has driven a Land Rover through a cobbled village. Not a single surface in the film isn\u2019t daubed in a Laura Ashley print. Most damning of all is the end-credits song, performed by Wet Wet Wet. Curtis could have chosen any band in the world. He chose Wet Wet Wet. Notting Hill Despite being set in the west London location best known for its annual carnival led by members of the African-Caribbean community, Notting Hill is one of the whitest films ever made. The protagonist is so posh that, when he pretends to be a journalist, the publication he claims to work for is Horse &amp; Hound. Love Actually At least the cast includes a prominent black figure, Chiwetel Ejiofor, although he exists primarily to get upstaged by Egg from This Life. The rest of the film presents a distorted view of the country. For example: people at Heathrow displaying emotions other than exhausted frustration; and a prime minister who isn\u2019t trying to destroy the country in pursuit of his legacy. A complete fraud. Yesterday A film in which people listen to and enjoy songs by the Beatles, without any of the historical or cultural context that led to the Beatles\u2019 initial popularity, in the year 2019, when one of the biggest songs of the year is about a cowboy who raps about how much he likes boobies.

The PKK was founded in 1978 by both Kurdish and Turkish students \u2013 when advocating for Kurdish rights in Turkey was punishable by torture and death. Since then, almost 50,000 people have been killed \u2013 mostly Kurdish and on the side of the PKK \u2013 after war broke out in 1984.</p> <p>There was hope the bloodshed would end in 2013, after the imprisoned leader of the PKK, Abdullah \u00d6calan, halted the party\u2019s commitment to armed struggle and called for the beginning of a peace process. But Erdo\u011fan\u2019s abrupt ending of the peace talks in 2015, in the face of bad pre-election polling numbers, proved he had no interest in peace, pluralism or democracy that could not be abandoned at the slightest sign of political inconvenience. The wave of repression of Kurds that has followed, conducted by Turkey in the name of \u201ccounter-terrorism\u201d, in fact served only to incite more conflict.</p> <p>This dynamic is misunderstood internationally: whenever the Kurdish movement is discussed, it often comes with the caveat that the PKK is a \u201cdesignated terrorist organisation\u201d. While this is legally true, it misrepresents fundamental social and political realities. For tens of millions of Kurds across the region, the PKK is a defender of their existence. It will maintain this support until Kurds believe that the states in which they live \u2013 in Turkey, as well as Iraq, Syria and Iran \u2013 are not directly hostile to the Kurdish identity itself.</p> <p>The Turkish government, however, seeks to attack any and all forms of Kurdish political expression \u2013 and the civilians who support it. Even the Kurdistan regional government in Iraq, which has deep economic ties with Turkey, was threatened with \u201cstarvation\u201d by Erdo\u011fan when its people voted to express their desire for independence. Kurds across the Middle East \u2013 which number at least 30 million \u2013 have taken notice of this pattern. They will not underestimate how far the Turkish leader is prepared to go to damage their cause.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/14/trump-syria-worst-week-us-foreign-policy-iraq-invasion\">Trump and Syria: the worst week for US foreign policy since the Iraq invasion?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Regardless, Erdo\u011fan\u2019s latest military offensive was not inevitable. The US had opportunities to defuse this crisis long before Trump\u2019s fateful phone call: its alliance with Turkey and partnership with the Kurdish movement in Syria gave it the opportunity to encourage both sides to return to a political process. Instead, at each juncture, it chose to scramble for temporary military solutions, evading the political problem at the heart of the conflict. The US withdrawal was the culmination of its historical ignorance and strategic blindness. Trump\u2019s framing of the removal of 50 American military personnel from the border \u2013 which preceded and enabled Turkey\u2019s military action \u2013 as a reduction in US involvement in \u201cendless wars\u201d, and the abandonment of a key ally in the fight against Isis as a step towards more equitable burden-sharing in the region are both ludicrous justifications for what is clearly an unforced error.</p> <p>The effects of Trump\u2019s decision, paradoxically, will only deepen the divisions driving the wars in both Turkey and Syria, and make<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/14/trump-syria-worst-week-us-foreign-policy-iraq-invasion\" title=\"\"> the global fight against terrorism more difficult</a>. The anti-Kurdish hostility behind last week\u2019s invasion has also led Turkey to tolerate, and even support, Isis and al-Qaida in Syria, simply because those forces are also fighting the Kurds.</p> <p>Trump wants us to believe that Turkey can lead the anti-Isis campaign and take control of thousands of Isis prisoners. Meanwhile, Erdo\u011fan\u2019s army attacks the very Kurdish forces that previously defeated Isis. Such short-sightedness is how wars are more often started \u2013 not ended. And it is the Kurds of northern Syria who will once again pay the price.</p> <p>\u2022 Giran Ozcan is the Peoples\u2019 Democratic party (HDP) representative to the USA and is based in Washington.

The PKK was founded in 1978 by both Kurdish and Turkish students \u2013 when advocating for Kurdish rights in Turkey was punishable by torture and death. Since then, almost 50,000 people have been killed \u2013 mostly Kurdish and on the side of the PKK \u2013 after war broke out in 1984. There was hope the bloodshed would end in 2013, after the imprisoned leader of the PKK, Abdullah \u00d6calan, halted the party\u2019s commitment to armed struggle and called for the beginning of a peace process. But Erdo\u011fan\u2019s abrupt ending of the peace talks in 2015, in the face of bad pre-election polling numbers, proved he had no interest in peace, pluralism or democracy that could not be abandoned at the slightest sign of political inconvenience. The wave of repression of Kurds that has followed, conducted by Turkey in the name of \u201ccounter-terrorism\u201d, in fact served only to incite more conflict. This dynamic is misunderstood internationally: whenever the Kurdish movement is discussed, it often comes with the caveat that the PKK is a \u201cdesignated terrorist organisation\u201d. While this is legally true, it misrepresents fundamental social and political realities. For tens of millions of Kurds across the region, the PKK is a defender of their existence. It will maintain this support until Kurds believe that the states in which they live \u2013 in Turkey, as well as Iraq, Syria and Iran \u2013 are not directly hostile to the Kurdish identity itself. The Turkish government, however, seeks to attack any and all forms of Kurdish political expression \u2013 and the civilians who support it. Even the Kurdistan regional government in Iraq, which has deep economic ties with Turkey, was threatened with \u201cstarvation\u201d by Erdo\u011fan when its people voted to express their desire for independence. Kurds across the Middle East \u2013 which number at least 30 million \u2013 have taken notice of this pattern. They will not underestimate how far the Turkish leader is prepared to go to damage their cause. Regardless, Erdo\u011fan\u2019s latest military offensive was not inevitable. The US had opportunities to defuse this crisis long before Trump\u2019s fateful phone call: its alliance with Turkey and partnership with the Kurdish movement in Syria gave it the opportunity to encourage both sides to return to a political process. Instead, at each juncture, it chose to scramble for temporary military solutions, evading the political problem at the heart of the conflict. The US withdrawal was the culmination of its historical ignorance and strategic blindness. Trump\u2019s framing of the removal of 50 American military personnel from the border \u2013 which preceded and enabled Turkey\u2019s military action \u2013 as a reduction in US involvement in \u201cendless wars\u201d, and the abandonment of a key ally in the fight against Isis as a step towards more equitable burden-sharing in the region are both ludicrous justifications for what is clearly an unforced error. The effects of Trump\u2019s decision, paradoxically, will only deepen the divisions driving the wars in both Turkey and Syria, and make the global fight against terrorism more difficult. The anti-Kurdish hostility behind last week\u2019s invasion has also led Turkey to tolerate, and even support, Isis and al-Qaida in Syria, simply because those forces are also fighting the Kurds. Trump wants us to believe that Turkey can lead the anti-Isis campaign and take control of thousands of Isis prisoners. Meanwhile, Erdo\u011fan\u2019s army attacks the very Kurdish forces that previously defeated Isis. Such short-sightedness is how wars are more often started \u2013 not ended. And it is the Kurds of northern Syria who will once again pay the price. \u2022 Giran Ozcan is the Peoples\u2019 Democratic party (HDP) representative to the USA and is based in Washington.

      "body": "<p><a href=\"http://www.johncohenworks.com/\" title=\"\">John Cohen</a>, who has died aged 87, was distinguished in at least three fields. As a photographer in the 1950s and 60s he made memorable images of contemporary American writers and painters, and of the young Bob Dylan soon after the singer\u2019s arrival in New York. As a film-making musicologist he documented traditional arts in the American South and in Peru. And as a musician, particularly as a founder member of the New Lost City Ramblers, he had an incalculable influence on the American folk revival and all that followed.</p> <p>The original Ramblers \u2013 Cohen, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/aug/10/obituary-mike-seeger\" title=\"\">Mike Seeger</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/oct/02/tom-paley-obituary\" title=\"\">Tom Paley</a> \u2013 inspired a generation to investigate the world of old-time music recorded in the 20s and 30s. As well as tracking down some of the original players, John (and Seeger) recorded in the field many hitherto unacknowledged musicians, such as the remarkable group of Appalachian banjo players gathered on John\u2019s anthology High Atmosphere (1975), or the traditional singer Dillard Chandler, whom John documented in the 1973 album and film <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQEqCHesLSY\" title=\"\">The End of an Old Song</a>.</p> <p>For lovers of old-time Appalachian music, however, John\u2019s most enduring gift may prove to be his work with the Kentucky singer, banjoist and guitarist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/mar/03/high-lonesome-sound-john-cohen-review\" title=\"\">Roscoe Holcomb</a>, who sang and played for him several albums of riveting music, and who was the central figure in his film <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlQJcSy6lHA\" title=\"\">The High Lonesome Sound</a> (1963).</p> <p>John was born in Queens, New York, to Israel, who owned a shoe store, and his wife, Sonia (nee Shack).

At Yale University, where he organised folk music events on campus and began photographing folk musicians, he secured a master\u2019s degree in fine arts in 1957. A year later he became a New Lost City Rambler.</p> <p>The Ramblers\u2019 live performances and 20 or so albums would take up much of John\u2019s energy for about a decade, but in 1961 he also found time to create, with Ralph Rinzler and Israel Young, the Friends of Old Time Music, a group of enthusiasts who promoted and staged the first New York concerts by Holcomb, Dock Boggs, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jun/24/ralph-stanley-obituary-bluegrasss-musician\" title=\"\">the Stanley Brothers</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/may/30/doc-watson\" title=\"\">Doc Watson</a>, Mississippi John Hurt and many other traditional performers.

      "bodyText": "Yesterday the government announced it had directed the ACCC to look into how banks were charging mortgage holders. Everyone loves to hate banks, so it\u2019s a pretty easy political exercise, even if in reality it will likely lead to no change. Because when asking whether the banks are gouging us and is this investigation warranted, the answer, as Reverend Lovejoy would say, is \u201cshort answer, yes with an if; long answer, no with a but.\u201d The reality is that it is a bit complicated. But before we get to it, I want you to promise me that when you have finished reading this you will check out the range of mortgage rates being offered and then ring up your bank and ask for a better deal. Seriously. Do it! For what it is worth, I finally got around to doing this two weeks ago and saw my home loan cut by 0.59% points. A friend then had hers cut by a whole 1% point after hearing what I had done. I have no idea if you will get a rate cut, but I can tell you this \u2013 no bank will offer you a deal if you don\u2019t ask. A major part of the banks\u2019 business model is to assume (rightly it seems) that we are gormless consumers who expect the rate that we have is the best they can offer. Banks act like this because they know most of us just go to one of the big four banks when we need a home loan: We will haggle over buying furniture but not the rate of the loan for the house in which the furniture will be put. So ring your bank. And if you want a bit of a guide, just realise that right now the average rate for all outstanding owner-occupier home loans (both principle and interest) is 3.8%: But while we often focus on mortgages \u2013 and this is the only thing the government has directed the ACCC to look at \u2013 let us also remember that there are two sides to banking and talk about deposits. It is true that the average mortgage rate is now well above the cash rate \u2013 and much more so than was the case before the GFC: But the gap between the average term deposit rate and the cash rate is also higher now than before the GFC: Prior to the GFC, the banks didn\u2019t care too much about your deposits. They were able to get cheap short-term funds from overseas money markets, so the need for your money was not as great. Before the GFC the average rate of term deposits was actually lower than the cash rate. But no one really cared, because with rates above 5%, they were averaging 2%-3% above inflation. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Given deposits in Australian banks are essentially guaranteed, that meant retirees and others who relied on term deposit returns for income were able to get a 3% real return with zero risk. Pretty sweet but certainly not the case now: The average rate of term deposits is now 0.3% pts above the cash rate, but also 0.3% below the rate of inflation. In effect, having your money in a term deposit will see you lose money in real terms. We need to consider this when we look at the question of whether or not banks should pass on the full rate of mortgage cuts. Because to an extent we could also be saying they should pass on the full cut to term deposits. The reality is banks can\u2019t really cut deposit rates any lower and still expect to attract people willing to give them their money. Half of all the money that banks use to then lend to home owners and businesses comes from our deposits \u2013 so they certainly do need it. Banks, however, cannot go overboard arguing that life is tough for them. In the past six months the cost of their short-term funds has dropped to a level not much higher than it was before the GFC: And here is the crucial thing \u2013 the gap between what banks charge us for a mortgage and what they pay us for a term deposit has widened greatly: So they certainly have been more willing recently to cut deposit rates than mortgage rates. But while the government will like looking tough on the banks, this \u201cprobe\u201d is pretty much a face-saving exercise. There is not much governments can do in a free market to force banks to do anything unless they find evidence of collusion. And the broader issue is not that the banks have failed to pass on the full rate cuts, but that rates have been cut to such a low level. The Reserve Bank has been forced to do all the work stimulating the economy, while the government has been more worried about returning to a budget surplus. And we should also remember that the RBA takes into account how much of the rate cuts are passed on by the banks. Had the banks passed on the full amount of the cash rate cuts that have occurred this year, it is likely the RBA would not have cut the cash rate by as much. In effect, the rate you are now paying most likely would not be much different, if at all. But none of this is all that new, and there is unlikely much the ACCC can do. They will most likely respond by arguing that the best thing is for people to be willing to move banks and to ask for a better deal. And you should. So now that you have finished, get on the phone and ring your bank. \u2022 Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist",

      "bodyText": "The Labor backbencher Julian Hill has declared Australia must vigorously contest any move to extradite the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange from the United Kingdom to the United States on espionage charges. Joining concerns about Assange expressed by the former Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce, the Victorian Labor MP told Guardian Australia: \u201cI do hold serious concerns about [Assange\u2019s] situation. \u201cHe\u2019s an Australian and at the very least we must be vigorously consistent in opposing extradition to countries where he might face the death penalty.\u201d Assange faced allegations of sexual assault in Sweden when he entered the Ecuadorian embassy in London 2012 and sought asylum because he feared being extradited to America. He spent nearly seven years in the embassy until police removed him in April after Ecuador revoked his political asylum. The British home secretary, Sajid Javid, has signed a request for Assange to be extradited to the US where he faces charges of computer hacking. Javid\u2019s decision opens the way for the WikiLeaks founder to be sent to the US. Assange faces an 18-count indictment, issued by the US Department of Justice, that includes charges under the Espionage Act. He is accused of soliciting and publishing classified information and conspiring to hack into a government computer. Australia\u2019s shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, met Assange\u2019s lawyer, Jennifer Robinson, last month, but declined to comment after the conversation. \u201cMr Assange\u2019s detention and any legal proceedings are a matter of current consideration in accordance with the British justice system and it would be inappropriate to comment while that process is under way.\u201d Joyce said on Monday: \u201cSovereignty is not just for people that you like or people that you have a philosophical relationship to, it might be for someone you detest, it might be for someone that you find completely obnoxious. \u201cNonetheless, if they\u2019re a citizen of this nation, they should be afforded the rights of a citizen.\u201d Government talking points, accidentally circulated to journalists on Monday, said of the Assange case: \u201cThe Australian government cannot interfere in the United Kingdom\u2019s legal processes, just as another country cannot interfere in ours. \u201cWe appreciate that some members of the public feel very strongly about Mr Assange\u2019s situation but it is important to remember that Australia cannot intervene in the legal processes of another country. \u201cMr Assange will be entitled to due process, including legal representation, in those processes.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The attorney general Christian Porter has emphatically rejected the Victorian government\u2019s claim the religious discrimination bill could harm its proposed ban on gay conversion therapy. In comments to Guardian Australia, Porter accused the Andrews Labor government of a \u201cclear lack of understanding\u201d of the bill which he said preserves states\u2019 rights to pass their own laws, suggesting the criticism was either inept or malicious. Porter is working on amendments to the exposure draft bill before introducing it to parliament, after concerns from human rights and LGBTI groups that it will license religious statements that breach other discrimination laws and employer concerns it will prevent them setting codes of conduct around religious speech. On Monday Porter told ABC\u2019s AM radio program he still intended to introduce the bill this year and suggested that amendments would address concerns about the functioning of religious aged care providers without making \u201cmassive or substantial\u201d changes to the rest of the bill. The Sydney Anglican church and Australian Catholic Bishops Conference have warned although religious bodies are themselves exempt from the ban on religious discrimination, the exemption will not apply to bodies engaging \u201csolely or primarily in commercial activities\u201d. Porter said the government had held consultations because \u201cit was difficult for us without the expertise to understand how religious aged care and hospitals work and what might be their requirements\u201d. He said that following those consultations, changes would be made that are not \u201cat the margin nor are they massive or substantial changes\u201d. On Monday the Victorian government opened consultation on its proposed ban on gay conversion therapy. In a statement the Victorian attorney general, Jill Hennessy, revealed it had also made a submission about the draft religious discrimination bill warning it \u201cmay hamper Victoria\u2019s work to end the hurt and damage being inflicted through these practices \u2013 when offered by religiously affiliated organisations or medical practitioners, or under the guise of religious belief\u201d. Victoria has not released its submission but Guardian Australia understands because it is considering using civil law \u2013 not criminal law \u2013 to ban gay conversion therapy, the federal bill could override the ban. Daniel Andrews has said people might escape the ban \u201con the basis this was part of their religious belief\u201d. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Porter told Guardian Australia: \u201cWhat the Andrews government\u2019s 1.5 page submission demonstrates to me is a clear lack of understanding about how the religious discrimination bill will work. \u201cNothing in the bill gives religious institutions or individuals the right to defy laws passed by state and territory governments,\u201d he said. \u201cAs such, it would not affect in any way Victoria\u2019s ability to introduce laws covering gay conversion therapy, or mandatory reporting, or any other criminal matter. \u201cTo suggest otherwise is just plain wrong and either the people who wrote or signed-off on this submission cannot read or interpret fairly straightforward legislative provisions, or there are other motives for attempting to misrepresent the bill.\u201d The bill overrides state rules that require doctors with a conscientious objection to refer patients to another health service and exempts statements of religious belief from state anti-discrimination laws. But the bill states that it is otherwise \u201cnot intended to exclude or limit the operation of a law of a state or territory to the extent that the law is capable of operating concurrently with this Act\u201d. On Monday the Labor leader in the Senate, Penny Wong, backed the Victorian government\u2019s concern, saying that \u201cfair-minded Australians will share his and my concerns about gay conversion therapy which we know is harmful\u201d. \u201cAs a matter of general principle, we do not want \u2026 laws around religious discrimination to weaken protections which already exist,\u201d she told ABC TV. The fate of the religious discrimination bill is uncertain, given the independent senator Jacqui Lambie and Centre Alliance\u2019s Rex Patrick have said they see no case for it or are yet to be convinced it addresses a real problem. On Monday Porter shrugged off the concern, suggesting Patrick was \u201cyet to be convinced until ultimately he gets convinced and that\u2019s a process \u2026 with the crossbench\u201d. Porter cited the example of a Jewish person refused entry to a function at New South Wales Parliament House as an example of why religious discrimination should be banned. Labor\u2019s shadow assistant treasurer, Stephen Jones, said the Morrison government had \u201ccreated a problem for themselves\u201d by promising \u201call things for all people on religious freedom and anti-discrimination\u201d. \u201cI fall on the side of people who say, we actually do not think the problem is as big as many have said it is. \u201cI think it is more important we have the existing laws as opposed to a legislative shift.\u201d",

Today the world faces the dual challenge of meeting its growing energy needs in a reliable and affordable manner while ensuring a sustainable environment for future generations.</p> <p>In the last century, availability of affordable energy mostly in the form of fossil fuels powered productivity growth and development around the world, contributing to an unprecedented improvement in quality of life, and a doubling of life expectancies. In the last 25 years, affordable energy helped lift a billion people out of poverty. We tend to take these achievements for granted.</p> <p>With every light there is a shadow \u2013 and for the world energy system that is the unsustainable emission of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane. The challenge for energy producers and consumers alike is to take meaningful actions to minimise these emissions and ultimately achieve carbon neutrality.</p> <p>Saudi Aramco has a long track record in reducing emissions from its operations. Thanks to decades-long investment in sustainable operations, we have achieved the lowest carbon intensity of any major oil producer. We are an industry leader in developing and deploying emissions-reducing technologies, partnering with public and private institutions around the world.</p> <p>In order to achieve a low-carbon future, we believe it is necessary to meet both global energy demand and lower emissions.

However, what the movement must not do is become anti-politics. We too often hear the cry that they are all the same, that the politicians are not listening. This is wrong.</p> <p>Maybe Boris Johnson panders to that stereotype, dismissing the protesters as \u201ccrusties\u201d, while his government does little to address the challenges. But what of others? The Labour party has a bold green deal in line with most of XR\u2019s demands. The Greens and the SNP also have progressive ideas.</p> <p>Many councils across the land have declared climate emergencies and are radically changing the way things are done. While progress may not be as rapid as some may hope, the impetus is there.</p> <p>XR and others need to keep up the pressure, but please don\u2019t lump all politicians together as useless.

Viable legal mechanisms need to ensure that the funds are exclusively spent in protecting and restoring forests, their biodiversity, and the native people living there. This process will only attain the support of the energy producers and the children marching in the streets if the funds maximise the conservation of forests in ways that minimise government abuse and other forms of corruption. The recent speeches at the UN were drowned out by the more eloquent and vociferous voices of tomorrow protesting on the streets outside. The initiative outlined here would provide an important first step in reversing the cascade of environmental sins that yesterday\u2019s fathers have heaped upon their children\u2019s futures.

Today the world faces the dual challenge of meeting its growing energy needs in a reliable and affordable manner while ensuring a sustainable environment for future generations. In the last century, availability of affordable energy mostly in the form of fossil fuels powered productivity growth and development around the world, contributing to an unprecedented improvement in quality of life, and a doubling of life expectancies. In the last 25 years, affordable energy helped lift a billion people out of poverty. We tend to take these achievements for granted. With every light there is a shadow \u2013 and for the world energy system that is the unsustainable emission of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane. The challenge for energy producers and consumers alike is to take meaningful actions to minimise these emissions and ultimately achieve carbon neutrality. Saudi Aramco has a long track record in reducing emissions from its operations. Thanks to decades-long investment in sustainable operations, we have achieved the lowest carbon intensity of any major oil producer. We are an industry leader in developing and deploying emissions-reducing technologies, partnering with public and private institutions around the world. In order to achieve a low-carbon future, we believe it is necessary to meet both global energy demand and lower emissions. That must include responsible investments which reduce the overall carbon footprint of the oil and gas industry and end-use markets. Ahmad O Al-Khowaiter Chief technology officer, Saudi Aramco, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia \u2022 Angela Singer (Letters, 11 October) clearly does not understand the aims of Extinction Rebellion, which are not to exhort the public to deliver climate action through making their own lives as carbon-neutral as possible (though this would of course be a good thing) \u2013 but to \u201cspeak truth to government\u201d so that those in power acknowledge what is actually happening to the planet, and act to reward and encourage sustainable businesses and transport systems, promote renewable energy solutions, and stop driving an economy based on fossil fuels. Marilyn Rayner Great Ness, Shropshire \u2022 If anyone doesn\u2019t know how to switch to renewable energy sources, they can always go to bigcleanswitch.org (switch to a green tariff in minutes from the UK\u2019s most trusted suppliers), and stay warm with renewables. Even gas can now been green. Wiebina Heesterman Birmingham \u2022 Extinction Rebellion are justified in their protests demanding radical change to save the planet. However, what the movement must not do is become anti-politics. We too often hear the cry that they are all the same, that the politicians are not listening. This is wrong. Maybe Boris Johnson panders to that stereotype, dismissing the protesters as \u201ccrusties\u201d, while his government does little to address the challenges. But what of others? The Labour party has a bold green deal in line with most of XR\u2019s demands. The Greens and the SNP also have progressive ideas. Many councils across the land have declared climate emergencies and are radically changing the way things are done. While progress may not be as rapid as some may hope, the impetus is there. XR and others need to keep up the pressure, but please don\u2019t lump all politicians together as useless. They need to effect the changes to save the planet \u2013 after all, who else will? Paul Donovan Labour councillor for the London borough of Redbridge \u2022 Polly Toynbee (Journal, 8 October) quotes Douglas Murray: \u201cTheir refusal to acknowledge any view but their own deranged belief and their defiance of democratic norms is authoritarian, even fascistic\u201d. Thank you, Mr Murray, for that superbly concise description of our present government. What do you mean, you were talking about Extinction Rebellion? Sarah Williamson Sheffield \u2022 Last week I found myself in the curious position at the Extinction Rebellion rally of sharing a platform with Stanley Johnson (PM\u2019s father tells climate crisis rally he is proud to be a \u2018crusty\u2019, 10 October). Unlike his son, with whom I had the dubious pleasure of sharing a few platforms during the 2012 London mayoral campaign, I can report that Johnson Senior gave a resounding cheer when I announced I was going to be the first female mayor of London.

      "bodyText": "Senior Scottish National party MPs, MSPs and councillors have expressed concerns about proposed changes to gender recognition laws as they launched a pledge calling for women to have the right to discuss such policies. Several women at the launch for the SNP women\u2019s pledge said they were close to quitting the party because of what they considered to be a refusal by officials to address concerns that women and girls could fall victim to predatory men or lose access to single-sex services. Speaking on the panel, the anti-Brexit campaigner Joanna Cherry said she had faced significant abuse online for raising concerns. While she said this came from \u201ca small minority of people\u201d, she said the controversy raised broader questions about how the party did business. \u201cThere are serious questions about how we develop policy in the SNP and how we conduct debate,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s important to disagree \u2013 we could do with more disagreement at times \u2013 but it has to be respectful.\u201d Cherry said she saw no conflict between signing the SNP\u2019s official Out for Indy pledge, which supports transgender rights, and the women\u2019s pledge. At the private meeting, which took place on Sunday night in the city centre of Aberdeen, where the SNP conference is taking place, some attendees spoke about being labelled transphobes for raising concerns, to the extent that they felt \u201cpushed underground\u201d.

Additional consultation is under way. Advocates for a law change say making the process of acquiring a gender recognition certificate less intrusive and bureaucratic, for example by removing the requirement for medical evidence, will benefit transgender individuals without having any impact on services available to women. Transgender rights groups point out there is already an absolute commitment from the Scottish government to consult more widely on the changes, which has been welcomed by LGBT organisations, and that potential unintended consequences should be discussed openly. The SNP leader and first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has previously stated she does not see \u201cthe greater recognition of transgender rights as a threat to me as a woman or to my feminism\u201d. The meeting on Sunday, which also heard from Margaret Lynch, the founder of Glasgow Rape Crisis, the SNP councillor Caroline McAllister and Rhona Hotchkiss, a former governor of Cornton Vale women\u2019s prison, was arranged privately.

Police officers are going to be held accountable for their actions, and we believe that will begin to change policing culture all over the world.\u201d</p> <p>But it would not. Guyger\u2019s conviction didn\u2019t even change police culture <em>near Dallas. </em>Before the ink could dry on the sentencing papers, a Fort Worth police officer entered into <a href=\"https://newsone.com/3889870/atatiana-jefferson-fort-worth-police-character-assassination/?fbclid=IwAR0xiDvjj6V9m3C3IrAdmyDxiYO32B5MuYUAwv2Y8SQ0INyksCEHB9YmGms\">Atatiana Jefferson\u2019s</a> home. He shot and killed her within seconds. She was playing video games with her nephew. A neighbor called a non-emergency number for a wellness check because Atatiana\u2019s door was open late at night. In 2013, Fort Worth police also <a href=\"https://www.courthousenews.com/panel-urged-to-advance-case-of-elderly-man-killed-by-cops/\">killed a man</a> in his own garage during a wellness check. The officers were not prosecuted.</p> <p>Merritt and some activists have issued calls for \u201cmore justice.\u201d I understand this impulse. After a police killing, prison is <em>something</em>, and that <em>something</em> can feel like justice when the other option seems like <em>nothing</em>. People understandably want police officers to be punished for killing black people. They also hope that prison will send a warning message to other officers that they cannot get away with murder. But that\u2019s not how policing works. If we want black people, or anybody, to be safe from police violence, then we must first be clear about one thing: prison is not justice. It is punishment, and contrary to popular belief, sending more cops to prison may not make other black people safe.</p> <p>Cop convictions are increasing, but cop killings roughly remain constant. As I have written before, police have killed about 14,000 people in the last 13 years, but only about 20 officers have been convicted of murder or manslaughter charges- an all time high. On average, police officers kill about 20 black people each year in Texas, and over 200 every year nationwide. Prison time certainly punishes some police for past behavior, but the US supreme court grants police so much legal protection for violent behavior that most of the killings are legal, constitutional or unexamined.</p> <p>Safety for black people could be less about sending individual cops to prison, and more about creating the conditions where people do not rely on police to feel safe. I was 13 years old when I saw a police officer shoot somebody. He was arguing with a teenager at a recreation center over a sign-in sheet. The officer stormed down the side of the basketball court, pulled out his gun, and shot the boy in his arm. After the horrific scream, I grabbed my sister and hid in the locker room for hours. The officer was not arrested. I doubt he was prosecuted. But he left after a few days, soon replaced by another officer with another gun who argued with more black kids over sign-in sheets. As police officers are transferred or sent to prison, new ones replace them, but the job description does not change. Thus, organizing around a single cop\u2019s conviction misses the point that <em>policing</em> is problematic, and one officer\u2019s punishment is a job opening for a future officer to inflict more harm and violence on communities of color.</p> <p>So what can happen instead of calling the police? Atatiana\u2019s death is tragic because her neighbor called a non-emergency number for help. He sought an alternative, but the police came anyway, guns blazing. One immediate lesson here is to not send police officers for non-emergency calls. There are ways that people practice safety intervention everyday. Scholar and prison abolition organizer Rachel Herzing <a href=\"https://truthout.org/articles/standing-up-for-our-communities-why-we-need-a-police-free-future/\">instructs</a> us to \u201cprepare for emergencies when not in crisis.\u201d This means memorizing numbers of neighbors close by, securing someplace to go if home is not an option, encouraging people to build small teams to share resources and protection with each other, and ultimately organizing to reduce the size and scope of police.</p> <p>As for what should happen to police officers after they kill someone right now, I deeply sympathize with fence sitters who believe in prison abolition, but feel wrong about including cops in that vision.

If a black man mistakenly kills a white woman police officer in Texas, her brother is not going to forgive him. A judge will certainly not warmly embrace him with a hug.

The pavilion\u2019s exhibits showcased Concorde, the hovercraft, the Mini and Mary Quant, among other design icons, all selected to highlight the theme The Challenge of Change. For that initiative Fred was made MBE. The way in which new ideas were expressed through exhibition at Expo 67 left a lasting impression on Fred \u2013 and made him determined to change how Great Britain should be presented thereafter. After befriending the newly appointed director of the Design Council, Sir Paul Reilly, he eagerly engaged with several emerging commercial design giants of that period, including Conran and Pentagram. In 1971 he was appointed deputy director of the Commonwealth Institute, where he immersed himself in addressing the challenges presented by a post-colonial world. His innovations there (including themed, sensory and immersive exhibitions) influenced the way that many cultural, educational and arts organisations operate today. He retired from the Commonwealth Institute in 1983, having overseen royal visits and worldwide cultural celebrations, and fostered an enduring commitment to international and intercultural understanding. He is survived by his long-term partner, Effie Geracopoulou, and his sons, Robert and David.",

      "body": "<h2><strong>Lisa Stansfield, singer, songwriter</strong></h2> <p>I met my husband Ian [Devaney] in school when I was 14 and he was 15; we formed a band with Andy Morris, who played trumpet in the school band. We called ourselves Blue Zone and were like three little terriers, getting on the train to London and bugging record companies until someone took notice.</p> <p>Ian and Andy did the horns on <a href=\"https://coldcut.net/\">Coldcut</a>\u2019s first album, and I sang a song with them called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQC9e9qQLxQ\">My Telephone</a>. After hours we all went back in to the studio to see if we could come up with anything together, and the result was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IoWjow6xDs\">People Hold On</a>, a massive hit. Because everyone said it would look clumsy with two bands\u2019 names on, it was released as \u201cColdcut featuring Lisa Stansfield\u201d. When we went back to our own music, they said, \u201cWell everyone knows you as Lisa Stansfield now\u201d and that was the end of Blue Zone. But I wanted my mates with me, even though it was my name on the record. That triangle of people was very strong.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVuuatjHGnY\">All Around </a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVuuatjHGnY\">the World</a> was something we wrote together. I came into the studio, and Ian was messing around at the piano. He had a melody, and I just started singing: \u201cBeen around the world and I, I, I\u2026\u201d Everyone laughed but Ian said, \u201cWait, it\u2019s really good, that.\u201d It just came into my head \u2013 it was nonsense, but had a really good feel to it. \u201cI, I, I\u201d became the main hook. We\u2019d no idea how massive it would become.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVuuatjHGnY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JVuuatjHGnY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>I was the first white British woman to reach No 1 on the R&amp;B chart \u2013 the American black music chart. I remember sitting in a hotel room reading all the different charts around the world and just going: \u201cFucking hell!\u201d All Around the World was top of most. Over the years, a lot of people have told me the song helped them through a difficult period. That\u2019s beautiful, to know you\u2019ve helped someone in that way. The song literally took us around the world, four times. I suppose you have to be careful what you sing, because you might have to do it.</p> <h2><strong>Ian Devaney, songwriter, producer</strong></h2> <p>Blue Zone was signed to an indie label, then Arista bought the label, so we ended up on a major by accident. We made a mainstream pop record and they needed a B-side, so we knocked out this song called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ehq_bNi-Yk\">Big Thing</a> in an eight-track studio behind Lisa\u2019s mum and dad\u2019s house. It was more soul than pop, and got more attention than the rest of the record. The label asked if we had any other songs like that, so we played them All Around the World.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ea5bdb6f3aff587a6bd5e6ed7c51ce64387c88ed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ea5bdb6f3aff587a6bd5e6ed7c51ce64387c88ed/280_149_1220_2173/561.jpg\" alt=\"Lisa Stansfield and Ian Devaney in 1990.\" width=\"561\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stansfield and Devaney in 1990.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The LIFE Picture Collection via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The song came together really quickly. Once Lisa had all the lyrics down and I\u2019d done a basic track with Andy, the whole vocal was two takes: one lead vocal and one take for single harmony. She just went in and sang it. The vocals from that original eight-track recording are what\u2019s on the global hit. We put real strings on it at Strawberry Studios in Stockport, but otherwise it was all low-budget and DIY. It\u2019s hilarious, really.</p> <p>The song\u2019s hugely influenced by Barry White. He was ridiculed in the disco era [as \u201cthe walrus of love\u201d], but we really respected him as a soul artist.

So on All Around the World, we did a shorter spoken intro as an unashamed pastiche or tribute. We were nervous about what he might say about it, but he was very sweet. We met him several times, and Lisa and Barry really got on and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLOWYAzs9GI\">re</a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLOWYAzs9GI\">record</a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLOWYAzs9GI\">ed it as a duet</a>.</p> <p>The lyrics \u2013 about searching the world for an estranged lover \u2013 aren\u2019t from personal experience. Lisa tends to make up stories and she\u2019s good at putting herself in someone else\u2019s shoes. If you write down \u201cbeen around the world and I, I, I, I can\u2019t find my baby\u201d it sounds nonsensical, but there\u2019s obviously something that connects emotionally. It leapt out to other people far more than it did to us. For us, it was one song in a group of five that we thought were good. But as soon as our manager, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/aug/24/jazz-summers\">Jazz Summers</a>, heard it, he went: \u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p>Lisa Stansfield <a href=\"https://lisa-stansfield.com/\">tours </a><a href=\"https://lisa-stansfield.com/\">the UK</a> from 21 October until 1 November.</p></li> </ul>",

The biggest opposition grouping, Civic Coalition (KO), scored 27.2% and the leftist alliance, the Left, 12.5%.</p> <p>But the ruling party lost control of the senate after opposition parties in most districts united around joint candidates, limiting its control of the legislature for the first time in four years and making it harder for it to push new laws through fast.</p> <p>It will not enjoy the free rein it has had since 2015 in the lower house either, and could well be forced to seek the backing of MPs from a new far-right group, Confederation, on more controversial policies.</p> <p>In Hungary, meanwhile, the hardline prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, suffered his greatest political setback in a decade when a pro-European, centre-left challenger ousted the Fidesz-backed incumbent as mayor of Budapest by 51% to 44%.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d96f7228b3cfabd8a9117596992520b7d688610f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d96f7228b3cfabd8a9117596992520b7d688610f/263_1024_4373_2624/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Viktor Orb\u00e1n, left, with the outgoing mayor of Budapest, Istv\u00e1n Tarl\u00f3s.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Viktor Orb\u00e1n, left, with the outgoing mayor of Budapest, Istv\u00e1n Tarl\u00f3s.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ferenc Isza/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A wide range of opposition parties from across the political spectrum united to back Gergely Kar\u00e1csony, 44, over 71-year-old Istv\u00e1n Tarl\u00f3s in the capital, with the same tactic meeting success in another 10 of Hungary\u2019s 23 major cities as well.</p> <p>The mayoral polls were a rare chance for Hungary\u2019s opposition to roll back the power of Fidesz, which holds a supermajority in parliament and had won seven consecutive landslides in national, municipal and European elections since 2010.</p> <p>The party has used its dominance to reform Hungary\u2019s institutions and concentrate power and much of the national media in Orb\u00e1n\u2019s hands, and has regularly clashed with Brussels over migration and rule-of-law issues.</p> <p>The tactic of fielding joint candidates could potentially offer a route to mounting a serious challenge to the strongman prime minister at the next general elections in 2022, although it could prove more difficult to replicate on a national level.</p> <p>\u201cIt proves that the new strategy of opposition cooperation works \u2013 this was the opposition\u2019s best result in years,\u201d said one analyst, Andr\u00e1s B\u00edr\u00f3-Nagy. \u201cIt is the first crack in the Orban system, and the strategy seems guaranteed to continue.\u201d</p> <p>But Naz Masraff of Teneo Intelligence said it could prove \u201chard to form a wide opposition project ahead of parliamentary elections, given the need to align diverging priorities ranging from the far-right Jobbik to Liberal Momentum\u201d.</p> <p>In Poland, PiS, with little opposition resistance, has also used its absolute majority in both houses to push through deep reforms of the court system that have brought it into conflict with the EU, and turned state TV and radio into propaganda tools.</p> <p>The ruling party cast the election as a choice between a society of traditional Catholic values and a liberal elite that undermines family life, with critics accusing it of stoking homophobia and anti-LGBT sentiment.

      "bodyText": "A narrower-than-expected win for Poland\u2019s ruling Law and Justice party (PiS) and a serious setback for Hungary\u2019s governing Fidesz show eastern Europe\u2019s illiberal nationalist parties are not entirely invincible, analysts and commentators have said. \u201cIt looks like this may be a small step in the right direction \u2013 but it\u2019s clear the opposition still has an awful lot of work to do,\u201d said Agata Gosty\u0144ska-Jakubowska, a senior research fellow at the Centre for European Reform. Ben Stanley, a political scientist at Warsaw\u2019s SWPS University, said Sunday\u2019s results suggested that when opposition parties \u201cwork together and construct a positive narrative, they can convincingly take on politicians who once looked unassailable\u201d. Cas Mudde, a political scientist and leading populism expert at the University of Georgia, said: \u201cIn both Hungary and Poland the opposition seemed to understand the fundamental challenge to liberal democracy they were facing. Strategic collaboration is crucial, particularly when the government party is gaming the system by, for example, controlling the media.\u201d PiS claimed victory in Sunday\u2019s parliamentary election, winning nearly 44% of the vote according to nearly complete results. The biggest opposition grouping, Civic Coalition (KO), scored 27.2% and the leftist alliance, the Left, 12.5%. But the ruling party lost control of the senate after opposition parties in most districts united around joint candidates, limiting its control of the legislature for the first time in four years and making it harder for it to push new laws through fast. It will not enjoy the free rein it has had since 2015 in the lower house either, and could well be forced to seek the backing of MPs from a new far-right group, Confederation, on more controversial policies. In Hungary, meanwhile, the hardline prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, suffered his greatest political setback in a decade when a pro-European, centre-left challenger ousted the Fidesz-backed incumbent as mayor of Budapest by 51% to 44%. A wide range of opposition parties from across the political spectrum united to back Gergely Kar\u00e1csony, 44, over 71-year-old Istv\u00e1n Tarl\u00f3s in the capital, with the same tactic meeting success in another 10 of Hungary\u2019s 23 major cities as well. The mayoral polls were a rare chance for Hungary\u2019s opposition to roll back the power of Fidesz, which holds a supermajority in parliament and had won seven consecutive landslides in national, municipal and European elections since 2010. The party has used its dominance to reform Hungary\u2019s institutions and concentrate power and much of the national media in Orb\u00e1n\u2019s hands, and has regularly clashed with Brussels over migration and rule-of-law issues. The tactic of fielding joint candidates could potentially offer a route to mounting a serious challenge to the strongman prime minister at the next general elections in 2022, although it could prove more difficult to replicate on a national level. \u201cIt proves that the new strategy of opposition cooperation works \u2013 this was the opposition\u2019s best result in years,\u201d said one analyst, Andr\u00e1s B\u00edr\u00f3-Nagy. \u201cIt is the first crack in the Orban system, and the strategy seems guaranteed to continue.\u201d But Naz Masraff of Teneo Intelligence said it could prove \u201chard to form a wide opposition project ahead of parliamentary elections, given the need to align diverging priorities ranging from the far-right Jobbik to Liberal Momentum\u201d. In Poland, PiS, with little opposition resistance, has also used its absolute majority in both houses to push through deep reforms of the court system that have brought it into conflict with the EU, and turned state TV and radio into propaganda tools. The ruling party cast the election as a choice between a society of traditional Catholic values and a liberal elite that undermines family life, with critics accusing it of stoking homophobia and anti-LGBT sentiment. It was also rewarded by poorer, mainly rural voters for the 70bn-zloty (\u00a314bn) social and welfare programmes it has rolled out. \u201cNonetheless, it was expecting to do better \u2013 it said it had not been given \u2018what it deserved\u2019,\u201d Stanley said. The party had not been altogether successful in walking the tightrope between keeping its base happy and not alienating floating voters, he said. \u201cBoth the blatant TV propaganda and the anti-LGBT campaign will actually have ended up putting some people off. PiS will not be able to govern in the same way that it has until now,\u201d Stanley said. But the performance of Poland\u2019s Left alliance in returning to parliament also suggested that \u201cwith good organisation and positive messaging, opposition parties can do well\u201d even in environments where they are under pressure, he added. \u201cThis idea that has held sway for so long in Poland and Hungary, that the other side has complete control of the discourse and all we can do is wait for them to make a mistake, looks like it may no longer apply.\u201d A coordinated opposition with a strong counter-narrative can cut through, agreed Gosty\u0144ska-Jakubowska. \u201cCertainly, we can say that some elements of the opposition\u2019s strategy \u2013 non-aggression pacts \u2013 do seem to have worked.

      "bodyText": "You can feel it in the air, the snap when you step outside that \u2013 in the absence of a warm hand to hold \u2013 sends you scurrying back inside for gloves. Cuffing season is coming. You know, the run-up to winter when previously contented single people start seeking shelter in the cosiness of a committed relationship \u2013 at least until the weather heats up again. So goes the meme, anyway. According to the \u201ccuffing season schedule\u201d lately posted all over Instagram, October is the time for \u201ctryouts\u201d, as you assess your roster of contenders for an autumn-winter mate to \u201ccuff\u201d (as in, handcuff) yourself to. It could be a short sentence. By mid-March, the schedule says, it is time to \u201ccancel or commit\u201d ahead of the summer of love \u2013 though timings can be \u201csubject to change based upon feelings\u201d. Woman of the hour Lizzo\u2019s new partnership with the vodka brand Absolut heralds the arrival of \u201ccuffing season HO!!! Time to curl up w/ a boo\u201d (and some Absolut, obviously). Jay-Z\u2019s Tidal streaming service has a whole playlist dedicated to it, described as: \u201cWhen the temperature drops, the thirst for a new bae rises.\u201d In 2014, the rapper Fabolous\u2019s 2015 song Cuffing Season sampled Bobby Vinton\u2019s Sealed with a Kiss: \u201cThough we gotta say goodbye for the summer \u2026\u201d In 2017, \u201ccuffing season\u201d was shortlisted by Collins dictionary for its word of the year, defined as \u201cthe period of autumn and winter, when single people are considered likely to seek settled relationships rather than engage in casual affairs\u201d. (It sadly lost out to \u201cfake news\u201d.) Cuffing season was first defined on the crowdsourced online Urban Dictionary in 2010 as \u201cthe time of year when people are looking to be in a relationship\u201d, and then subsequently in 2018 as \u201ca stupid made-up season with no correlating evidence whatsoever\u201d. Both are correct. Like much digital culture, cuffing season exists mostly in name after being coined as a joke, then cemented in endless explanations online \u2013 but its sheer endurance reflects a central truth. According to Google Trends, the term has climbed steadily from 2013, with sharp spikes in late October or early November. As we have seen with \u201ccancel culture\u201d and \u201cmilkshake duck\u201d, a previously meaningless phrase can become useful shorthand for a facet of the zeitgeist that we have struggled to articulate. In this case: that it can suck to be single in winter. People tend to socialise less, meaning more nights spent at home alone for many. Shorter days can exacerbate feelings of loneliness or depression, and can bring on Seasonal Affective Disorder. The holidays may loom as unwelcome reminders: another Christmas or New Year\u2019s spent single, an empty diary come Valentine\u2019s Day. The social media monitoring firm BrandWatch found that mentions of cuffing season had grown at almost the same rate as mentions of the weather getting colder \u2013 \u201ca direct correlation going all the way back to 1 July,\u201d said Kellan Terry, who did the analysis. In the first 10 days of October, there were some 60,000 references to cuffing season on social media. The most prominent emotion was sadness, said Terry; the reason being \u201cmany, many people don\u2019t think they\u2019ll find a partner to partake in all of the season\u2019s festivities\u201d. \u201cFestivities\u201d may be putting it strongly. The rapper Megan Thee Stallion\u2019s \u201chot girl summer\u201d meme \u2013 about, she said, \u201cwomen and men being unapologetically them, just having a good-ass time\u201d \u2013 captured the collective imagination earlier this year. But it may feel harder to celebrate singledom in the colder, darker months. Marisa T Cohen, a relationship scientist based in New York, is upfront about there being \u201clittle empirical support\u201d for the existence of cuffing season, but says \u201cthere is definitely something to it\u201d. From an evolutionary perspective, we have sought warmth from others to aid in our survival. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like when animals hibernate,\u201d says Cohen. A 2008 study from the University of Wroclaw, Poland, showed that men found women\u2019s bodies most attractive in the winter and less so during the warmer months. Studies have also shown that testosterone production peaks around October and November, Cohen adds \u2013 \u201cso that\u2019s going to lead to people wanting to engage in more sexual activity\u201d. Although it seems unlikely that anyone looking to get \u201ccuffed up\u201d for winter would also be wanting to become a parent, most babies in the US are born in July through to September, reflecting wintertime conception. In the UK, Office for National Statistics analysis from 2015 showed that more babies were conceived in the Christmas period than at any other time of the year. Serotonin can sometimes decrease in winter, notes Cohen, lowering mood; becoming romantically involved with someone is one way of boosting it. \u201cGetting involved in a relationship can counteract some of those biochemical changes that are occurring,\u201d she says. The external pressures are more obvious. When families get together for the holidays, says Cohen, \u201cthere might be some social comparison going on\u201d between you and your cousins of the same age, for example: why do they have partners, and you don\u2019t? \u201cOr it might be external pressure from aunts, uncles, grandparents: \u2018When are you going to bring someone home?\u2019 or \u2018Are you planning on getting married?\u2019\u201d That can lead people to focus critically on their singledom, as can media representations of the colder months that celebrate romantic relationships to the exclusion of all others. \u201cEvery single Hallmark movie is basically one of those \u2018home for the holidays\u2019 tropes,\u201d says Cohen, \u201cwhere you go back to your small town to celebrate Christmas and fall in love with the person from high school you grew up with.\u201d In fact, 2012 analysis from Facebook \u201ctracking the seasonality of relationships\u201d from status changes found that, in the days around Valentine\u2019s Day and Christmas, \u201cfar more people paired up \u2026 than joined the ranks of the newly single\u201d.

A study from 2012, in the Journal of Consumer Research, found that being physically cold \u201cin turn leads to an increased liking for romance movies\u201d \u2013 further fuelling those forces of embodied cognition. Certainly, there is a strong aesthetic associated online with autumn (or #fallvibes): \u201cpumpkin spice\u201d beverages, kicking piles of leaves, and rewatching Love, Actually \u2013 all reliably lacklustre experiences, especially by yourself. No wonder one solution is to get yourself a seasonal partner. In 2014, a Craigslist listing for \u201cfall boyfriends\u201d for ski holidays, apple picking and Instagramming with \u201call the fall emojis\u201d went viral.

      "body": "<p> A group of former partners at PricewaterhouseCoopers, including one who now works at the industry regulatory, shared a \u00a3100m windfall payout this year after the accountancy and consulting company reported record profits.</p> <p>About 1,100 former PwC partners collected an average of \u00a391,000 in \u201cannuity\u201d payments in 2019, according to its annual report.</p> <p>Among the beneficiaries was John Hitchins, who sits on the conduct committee of the Financial Reporting Council (FRC), the regulator for the audit and accountancy industry. Hitchins was a PwC partner for 26 years until he retired in 2014. Other ex-partners also hold prominent jobs on the boards of major companies, but PwC would not release a list of those who collected the payments or detail how much they each received.</p> <p>Revelations of the huge payouts to former partners, first reported <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d679ceee-ec33-11e9-85f4-d00e5018f061\">by the Financial Times</a>, come at a time of intense public and political scrutiny of the industry after a string of accounting scandals including at the construction company Carillion, the cafe chain Patisserie Valerie and the department store BHS.</p> <p>The competition watchdog has proposed a radical overhaul of the audit market that would force the \u201cbig four\u201d accountants \u2013 which also include Deloitte, EY and KPMG \u2013 to split their audit and consulting businesses, with different bosses, management teams, accounts and pay policies.</p> <p>PwC was criticised by the FRC in July for an \u201cunsatisfactory\u201d deterioration in inspection results for its audits of FTSE 350 clients. Earlier in the year MPs criticised <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/pricewaterhousecoopers\">PwC</a> for \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/21/pwc-faces-mps-over-accusations-of-milking-the-carillion-cow-dry\">milking the cash cow dry</a>\u201d after it charged \u00a344m for a year\u2019s work as special project managers on the administration of Carillion.</p> <p>A spokesman for PwC said it was standard practice for accountancy and law firms to pay their retired partners a share of ongoing profits. However, PwC\u2019s rivals are paying out much smaller amounts: KMPG is expected to pay \u00a34m this year, and EY \u00a36m. PwC\u2019s \u00a3100m payout works out at about 10% <a href=\"https://www.pwc.co.uk/annualreport/assets/2019/pdf/annual-report-2019-financial-statements.pdf\">of </a><a href=\"https://www.pwc.co.uk/annualreport/assets/2019/pdf/annual-report-2019-financial-statements.pdf\"> its </a><a href=\"https://www.pwc.co.uk/annualreport/assets/2019/pdf/annual-report-2019-financial-statements.pdf\">\u00a31.08bn</a><a href=\"https://www.pwc.co.uk/annualreport/assets/2019/pdf/annual-report-2019-financial-statements.pdf\"> profit</a> for 2019.</p> <p>The average payout of \u00a391,000 works out as three times the average UK salary, according to the Office of National Statistics (ONS). The former PwC partners, who could retire as early as 53, shared out \u00a397m in 2018. They are not part of PwC\u2019s standard retirement pay scheme.</p> <p>A PwC spokesman said: \u201cApproximately 1,100 former partners receive annuities payments. There are rules within our partnership agreement which determine how the amounts are calculated and the period of time over which they are paid.</p> <p>\u201cOur partnership agreement requires former partners to comply with requirements we have in place for establishing and maintaining the firm\u2019s independence in relation to clients and others, and this includes notifying us if they are considering taking on roles at an audit client. PwC complies with the auditor independence rules in the UK which say that if a former partner accepts a management position at an audit client then it\u2019s necessary for the firm to ensure there is not any ongoing significant connection between the former partner and the firm.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesman for the FRC said: \u201cIn line with long-established FRC procedures John Hitchins does not participate in any decisions regarding PwC at conduct committee.\u201d</p> <p>Luke Hildyard, the director of the High Pay Centre, a thinktank that examines excessive pay, said: \u201cAfter the aftermath of a succession of accounting scandals and corporate failures, there are justifiable questions about whether firms like PwC should be dedicating more rigorous analysis to their audits involving more experienced staff. That would be a better use of their resources than spending millions of pounds on payouts for retired partners.</p> <p>\u201cThe lavish pay practices of the audit firms highlight the self-enrichment culture of an industry that is supposed to fulfil a critical corporate governance function. Audits carried out by public servants with a public service ethos and a remit to look beyond narrow financial measures of company performance to social and environmental considerations would be a far more cost-effective model for the industry, more closely aligned with the public interest.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "A group of former partners at PricewaterhouseCoopers, including one who now works at the industry regulatory, shared a \u00a3100m windfall payout this year after the accountancy and consulting company reported record profits. About 1,100 former PwC partners collected an average of \u00a391,000 in \u201cannuity\u201d payments in 2019, according to its annual report. Among the beneficiaries was John Hitchins, who sits on the conduct committee of the Financial Reporting Council (FRC), the regulator for the audit and accountancy industry. Hitchins was a PwC partner for 26 years until he retired in 2014. Other ex-partners also hold prominent jobs on the boards of major companies, but PwC would not release a list of those who collected the payments or detail how much they each received. Revelations of the huge payouts to former partners, first reported by the Financial Times, come at a time of intense public and political scrutiny of the industry after a string of accounting scandals including at the construction company Carillion, the cafe chain Patisserie Valerie and the department store BHS. The competition watchdog has proposed a radical overhaul of the audit market that would force the \u201cbig four\u201d accountants \u2013 which also include Deloitte, EY and KPMG \u2013 to split their audit and consulting businesses, with different bosses, management teams, accounts and pay policies. PwC was criticised by the FRC in July for an \u201cunsatisfactory\u201d deterioration in inspection results for its audits of FTSE 350 clients. Earlier in the year MPs criticised PwC for \u201cmilking the cash cow dry\u201d after it charged \u00a344m for a year\u2019s work as special project managers on the administration of Carillion. A spokesman for PwC said it was standard practice for accountancy and law firms to pay their retired partners a share of ongoing profits. However, PwC\u2019s rivals are paying out much smaller amounts: KMPG is expected to pay \u00a34m this year, and EY \u00a36m. PwC\u2019s \u00a3100m payout works out at about 10% of its \u00a31.08bn profit for 2019. The average payout of \u00a391,000 works out as three times the average UK salary, according to the Office of National Statistics (ONS). The former PwC partners, who could retire as early as 53, shared out \u00a397m in 2018. They are not part of PwC\u2019s standard retirement pay scheme. A PwC spokesman said: \u201cApproximately 1,100 former partners receive annuities payments. There are rules within our partnership agreement which determine how the amounts are calculated and the period of time over which they are paid. \u201cOur partnership agreement requires former partners to comply with requirements we have in place for establishing and maintaining the firm\u2019s independence in relation to clients and others, and this includes notifying us if they are considering taking on roles at an audit client. PwC complies with the auditor independence rules in the UK which say that if a former partner accepts a management position at an audit client then it\u2019s necessary for the firm to ensure there is not any ongoing significant connection between the former partner and the firm.\u201d A spokesman for the FRC said: \u201cIn line with long-established FRC procedures John Hitchins does not participate in any decisions regarding PwC at conduct committee.\u201d Luke Hildyard, the director of the High Pay Centre, a thinktank that examines excessive pay, said: \u201cAfter the aftermath of a succession of accounting scandals and corporate failures, there are justifiable questions about whether firms like PwC should be dedicating more rigorous analysis to their audits involving more experienced staff. That would be a better use of their resources than spending millions of pounds on payouts for retired partners. \u201cThe lavish pay practices of the audit firms highlight the self-enrichment culture of an industry that is supposed to fulfil a critical corporate governance function. Audits carried out by public servants with a public service ethos and a remit to look beyond narrow financial measures of company performance to social and environmental considerations would be a far more cost-effective model for the industry, more closely aligned with the public interest.\u201d",

Corbyn is coming under pressure from many in the party, including his own shadow cabinet, to press for a second referendum before an election.</p> \n<p>Heckled that he had not voted for an election when Johnson tried to call one twice this autumn, he said it was essential for Johnson to \u201cget an extension \u2026 take us away from the dangers of no deal, then we\u2019re in a position to do that\u201d.</p> \n<p>He added: \u201cWe may only be just weeks away from the first Queen\u2019s speech of a Labour government. In that Queen\u2019s speech, Labour will put forward the most radical and people-focused programme in modern times, a once-in-a-generation chance to rebuild and transform our country.\u201d</p> \n<p>Responding for the government, Johnson said Corbyn could not make up his mind on whether to back an election and criticised him for changing his position on Brexit.</p> \n<p>\u201cHis policy on cake is neither having it, nor eating it,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cFirst he was opposed to no deal, now he seems to be opposed to any deal. First he was in favour of delivering Brexit, now he wants a second referendum. First he wanted an election \u2013 actually he wanted an election for quite a long time \u2013 now he\u2019d much rather not.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe resembles a Janus. A push-me-pull-you facing both directions at once and yet unable to decide for either.\u201d</p> \n<p>Johnson dismissed criticism of his Queen\u2019s speech, saying it was a programme for \u201can open, global, free-trading United Kingdom\u201d.</p> \n<p>More than a third of the new bills announced by the Queen relate to arrangements to be made after Britain\u2019s departure from the EU.</p> \n<p>Other key elements of a speech widely trailed in advance included <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/13/tories-distract-from-brexit-crime-focused-queens-speech\">plans for tougher jail sentences</a> \u2013 one of seven bills devoted to law and order, a direction that has prompted alarm from prison reform charities \u2013 and proposals <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/13/conservatives-accused-of-election-rigging-leaked-id-plans-voter-fraud\">to oblige people to show photographic ID</a> before they are allowed to vote.</p> \n<p>On Brexit, Corbyn said the government had had \u201cthree and a half years to get Brexit done and they\u2019ve failed\u201d. </p> \n<p>He said the prime minister\u2019s speech \u201cwas supposed to herald an end to austerity and a new vision. Instead it barely begins to unpick the devastating cuts to public services.\u201d</p> \n<p>Corbyn condemned plans to increase sentences for violent offenders, saying judges already had the necessary powers.</p> \n<p>He concluded: \u201cThis legislative programme is a propaganda exercise that cannot disguise that this government has failed on Brexit for over three years, that they are barely beginning to undo the damage of a decade of cuts to our public services, that it does nothing for people struggling to make ends meet, does nothing to make our world a safer place or tackle the climate emergency.\u201d</p> \n<p>On another primary election battleground, health, the main measure outlined was not legislative but a proposal for a new long-term plan for the NHS. On social care, there was a proposal for a consultation.</p> \n<p>A series of other bills outlined by the Queen have either already been before parliament or been discussed in depth, for example on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/sep/06/prorogation-of-uk-parliament-must-not-delay-domestic-abuse-reform-say-activists\">domestic abuse</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/feb/08/no-fault-divorce-to-become-the-law\">no-fault divorce</a>, a measure <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/oct/01/tories-to-ban-restaurant-owners-taking-tips\">to oblige restaurants</a> and other businesses to pass on all tips to staff and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/12/grenfell-tower-law-compels-owners-to-keep-buildings-safe\">tougher regulations on fire safety</a> in high-rise buildings in response to the Grenfell Tower disaster.</p> \n<p>Other pledges for future bills covered areas also likely to feature strongly in the Conservative election manifesto, such as increased schools funding and more free schools, legislation intended to help the rollout of faster broadband and an environment bill outlining post-Brexit policies in areas including plastic, biodiversity and air quality.</p> \n<p>The Queen\u2019s speech will be debated by MPs for several days but is unlikely to be approved by parliament, given Johnson\u2019s lack of a majority in the Commons. However, his official spokesman said he would not resign if he were to lose the formal vote on it next week.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe is committed to delivering on his domestic agenda, as well as delivering Brexit. If MPs do choose to vote against the Queen\u2019s speech, it will be for them to explain to the public why they are voting against greater support for our public services, for the police, schools and hospitals; why they are blocking legislation that would lead to serious and dangerous offenders spending more time in prison; and why they are standing in the way of significant infrastructure improvements.\u201d</p> \n<p>In an attempt to show that it is determined to press ahead with its legislative agenda, the government will table seven bills on Tuesday including on the environment, animal welfare and pensions.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Jeremy Corbyn has condemned the government\u2019s planned legislative programme outlined in the Queen\u2019s speech as \u201ca farce\u201d, as he signalled he would back a general election that could deliver a Labour government within weeks. The Labour leader dismissed Boris Johnson\u2019s programme for government as hollow, after the monarch read out a list of 26 bills and other ideas mainly related to Brexit, crime and the NHS. \u201cThe prime minister promised that this Queen\u2019s speech would dazzle us,\u201d Corbyn said. \u201cOn closer inspection, it turns out to be nothing more than fool\u2019s gold. \u201cThere has never been such a farce as a government with a majority of minus 45 and a 100% record of defeat in the Commons setting out a legislative agenda they know cannot be delivered in this parliament.\u201d He signalled Labour was still prepared to vote for a general election as soon as the threat of a no-deal Brexit was off the table, potentially meaning it could be held in early December. Corbyn is coming under pressure from many in the party, including his own shadow cabinet, to press for a second referendum before an election. Heckled that he had not voted for an election when Johnson tried to call one twice this autumn, he said it was essential for Johnson to \u201cget an extension \u2026 take us away from the dangers of no deal, then we\u2019re in a position to do that\u201d. He added: \u201cWe may only be just weeks away from the first Queen\u2019s speech of a Labour government. In that Queen\u2019s speech, Labour will put forward the most radical and people-focused programme in modern times, a once-in-a-generation chance to rebuild and transform our country.\u201d Responding for the government, Johnson said Corbyn could not make up his mind on whether to back an election and criticised him for changing his position on Brexit. \u201cHis policy on cake is neither having it, nor eating it,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cFirst he was opposed to no deal, now he seems to be opposed to any deal. First he was in favour of delivering Brexit, now he wants a second referendum. First he wanted an election \u2013 actually he wanted an election for quite a long time \u2013 now he\u2019d much rather not. \u201cHe resembles a Janus. A push-me-pull-you facing both directions at once and yet unable to decide for either.\u201d Johnson dismissed criticism of his Queen\u2019s speech, saying it was a programme for \u201can open, global, free-trading United Kingdom\u201d. More than a third of the new bills announced by the Queen relate to arrangements to be made after Britain\u2019s departure from the EU. Other key elements of a speech widely trailed in advance included plans for tougher jail sentences \u2013 one of seven bills devoted to law and order, a direction that has prompted alarm from prison reform charities \u2013 and proposals to oblige people to show photographic ID before they are allowed to vote. On Brexit, Corbyn said the government had had \u201cthree and a half years to get Brexit done and they\u2019ve failed\u201d. He said the prime minister\u2019s speech \u201cwas supposed to herald an end to austerity and a new vision. Instead it barely begins to unpick the devastating cuts to public services.\u201d Corbyn condemned plans to increase sentences for violent offenders, saying judges already had the necessary powers. He concluded: \u201cThis legislative programme is a propaganda exercise that cannot disguise that this government has failed on Brexit for over three years, that they are barely beginning to undo the damage of a decade of cuts to our public services, that it does nothing for people struggling to make ends meet, does nothing to make our world a safer place or tackle the climate emergency.\u201d On another primary election battleground, health, the main measure outlined was not legislative but a proposal for a new long-term plan for the NHS. On social care, there was a proposal for a consultation. A series of other bills outlined by the Queen have either already been before parliament or been discussed in depth, for example on domestic abuse, no-fault divorce, a measure to oblige restaurants and other businesses to pass on all tips to staff and tougher regulations on fire safety in high-rise buildings in response to the Grenfell Tower disaster. Other pledges for future bills covered areas also likely to feature strongly in the Conservative election manifesto, such as increased schools funding and more free schools, legislation intended to help the rollout of faster broadband and an environment bill outlining post-Brexit policies in areas including plastic, biodiversity and air quality. The Queen\u2019s speech will be debated by MPs for several days but is unlikely to be approved by parliament, given Johnson\u2019s lack of a majority in the Commons. However, his official spokesman said he would not resign if he were to lose the formal vote on it next week. \u201cHe is committed to delivering on his domestic agenda, as well as delivering Brexit. If MPs do choose to vote against the Queen\u2019s speech, it will be for them to explain to the public why they are voting against greater support for our public services, for the police, schools and hospitals; why they are blocking legislation that would lead to serious and dangerous offenders spending more time in prison; and why they are standing in the way of significant infrastructure improvements.\u201d In an attempt to show that it is determined to press ahead with its legislative agenda, the government will table seven bills on Tuesday including on the environment, animal welfare and pensions.",

She was senior director for Europe and Russia in the National Security Council (NSC) for more than two years, giving her a front seat at the struggle over US policy towards Moscow and Trump\u2019s peculiar personal attachment to Vladimir Putin. Hill was brought into the White House by Trump\u2019s second national security adviser, HR McMaster, plucking her out of the Washington thinktank world, because of her expertise on Putin and Russia. She had co-written a book on the Russian autocrat, titled Mr Putin: Operative in the Kremlin, that stressed the extent that his KGB career had shaped his worldview. \u201cShe went in out of a sense of duty,\u201d a friend said. \u201cOnce she was in the White House, she tried to impose some sense of order and process on the chaos over Russia policy. When there was a state department translator in meetings Trump meetings with Putin, that didn\u2019t happen by accident.\u201d Hill planned to work at the NSC for a year but was asked to stay on by McMaster\u2019s successor, John Bolton, despite calls to get rid of her from Trump acolytes, aware Hill was not a political loyalist. She handed responsibilities to her successor, Tim Morrison, on 15 July, and actually left the White House on 19 July, six days before Trump\u2019s infamous call with Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in which the US president asked for \u201ca favour\u201d in carrying out certain targeted investigations. It is unclear whether Trump\u2019s efforts to use Ukrainian reliance on the US to his political advantage affected the timing of Hill\u2019s departure, but she is expected to testify about the emergence of a parallel Ukraine policy run by Rudy Giuliani, the former New York mayor who is commonly described as Trump\u2019s personal lawyer. Giuliani clearly thought his channel, focusing on digging dirt on the Bidens, had priority, and has sought to portray Hill as being out of the loop. \u201cMaybe she was engaged in secondary foreign policy if she didn\u2019t know I was asked to take a call from President Zelenskiy\u2019s very close friend,\u201d he told NBC News. Texts released by Congress between two diplomats working with Giuliani, the ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, and Kurt Volker, formerly special envoy for Ukraine, suggest that they expected more flexibility from Morrison, Hill\u2019s replacement. Hill was born in Bishop Auckland, Durham, the daughter of a miner and a nurse, and became a dual national after marrying an American she met at Harvard. She still speaks with flat northern English vowels. The American chapter in her life opened quite by chance. After winning a scholarship to St Andrews University, she was in Moscow during the 1988 Reagan-Gorbachev summit and got an internship making coffee for the NBC Today Show. There, she met an American professor who suggested she apply for postgraduate studies at Harvard. Since it became clear Hill would be an important witness in the House impeachment hearings, she has been subjected to furious attack on hard-right talkshows and conspiracy theories on social media, some pointing to the fact that she knows Christopher Steele, the author of the famous 2016 dossier alleging Trump\u2019s collusion with the Kremlin, from a previous stint in government, in the National Intelligence Council. Such attacks have become a routine form of intimidation aimed at stopping officials like Hill saying what they know about the inner workings of the Trump White House. Hill\u2019s manner is understated, precise and discreet. Since entering the White House, she has hardly talked to the press and not made appearances in the thinktank world. Her deposition to Congress puts her into an unaccustomed limelight. \u201cShe was not looking forward to it but she knew she was going to testify. She will answer the questions and says what she knows, but she is not going to give some sweeping denunciation of the Trump administration,\u201d her friend said. \u201cShe has respect for the people she worked for, even if she didn\u2019t necessarily agree with them. They have all been in the same foxhole together.\u201d",

The analysis, undertaken by Richard Heede at the <a href=\"http://climateaccountability.org/\">Climate Accountability Institute</a>,&nbsp;calculates how much carbon is emitted throughout the supply chain, from extraction to use by consumers.

Under cap-and-trade, a limit is set on emissions and businesses issued with permits to emit carbon. Those cutting their emissions fastest can sell spare permits to laggards, while the cap is ratcheted down over time. But success depends on a strict cap and a scarcity of permits, and <a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/qa-will-reformed-eu-emissions-trading-system-raise-carbon-prices\">the EU\u2019s scheme</a> has been widely criticised. An alternative is a tax, which forces companies to factor the damage caused by climate change into their business decisions, and should encourage them to cut waste, cut emissions and use clean technology. The danger is of carbon leakage: that the extra cost in one country might encourage businesses to look elsewhere to site their factories. This can be dealt with by a border adjustment tax, as the <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-eu-commission-timmermans-border-tax/incoming-top-eu-climate-official-pledges-to-tax-polluting-imports-idUKKBN1WN23F\">EU\u2019s new commissioner pledged</a> this week.

All companies are responsive to economic pressure, however. The only way to cut emissions from oil in the long term is to stop using oil. Reducing demand is driven by government regulation and by technological development (also driven by regulation), such as cheaper solar panels, offshore windfarms, electric cars and improved public transport.</p> \n<h2><strong>Stop flaring</strong></h2> \n<p>If oil and gas are to be extracted, the least oil companies can do is extract efficiently. The <a href=\"https://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/zero-routine-flaring-by-2030\">World Bank has estimated</a> that the amount of gas wastefully flared globally each year, if used for power generation instead, could supply all of Africa\u2019s electricity needs. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6f8f334e-0ebd-11e9-a3aa-118c761d2745\">The FT</a> reported earlier this year that flaring in Texas was lighting up the night sky as producers let off the gas to get the oil to market quickly, to turn a faster buck regardless of the environmental consequences. The World Bank wants an end to routine flaring globally by 2030 \u2013 yet <a href=\"https://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/gasflaringreduction#7\">in 2018 it increased</a>. </p> \n<h2><strong>Roll out large scale carbon capture and storage</strong></h2> \n<p>Trapping and burying the CO2 from fossil fuel burning is possible but not yet deployed at scale. Without this, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says tackling the climate crisis will be much more expensive. Oil companies have the expertise to roll out CCS but say that without a price on carbon emissions there is no commercial incentive. CCS could be used to actually remove CO2 from the atmosphere by growing trees and plants, burning them for electricity, then sequestering the emissions.

      "bodyText": "The world\u2019s rising reliance on fossil fuels may come to an end decades earlier than the most polluting companies predict, offering early signs of hope in the global battle to tackle the climate crisis. The climate green shoots have emerged amid a renewable energy revolution that promises an end to the rising demand for oil and coal in the 2020s, before the fossil fuels face a terminal decline. The looming fossil fuel peak is expected to emerge decades ahead of forecasts from oil and mining companies, which are betting that demand for polluting energy will rise until the 2040s. But energy experts are adjusting their forecasts as clean energy technologies, including wind and solar power, emerge faster than predicted and at costs that pose a direct threat to coal-fired electricity and combustion-engine vehicles. In the UK, renewable energy projects generated more electricity over the last quarter than fossil fuels for the first time since the country\u2019s first public power plant fired up in 1882. It is a marked change from only 10 years ago, when gas and coal generated more than 70% of the UK\u2019s electricity. The pace of progress has raised hope that the global groundswell of climate protest could spark fresh political will to accelerate the energy transition in time to keep global temperatures from rising to levels that could trigger a climate catastrophe. The UK Labour party has promised a Green Industrial Revolution to create almost 70,000 new jobs while working to create a carbon-neutral economy by 2030. In the US, the Green New Deal, spearheaded by the congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, aims to virtually eliminate the US\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions within the next decade. Within the energy industry, experts believe the rapid rise of renewable energy in recent years may soon seem glacial compared with the changes to come. Michael Liebreich, the founder of the research group Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF), says the substitution of old technology with new is always \u201clike waiting for a sneeze\u201d. \u201cThe first 1% takes forever, 1% to 5% is like waiting for a sneeze \u2013 you know it\u2019s inevitable but it takes longer than you think \u2013 then 5% to 50% happens incredibly fast,\u201d he says. The world is about to enter this period of rapid transformation, he says. This change promises to upend the fossil fuel producers that fail to adapt at pace, and bring the rise of carbon emissions to an end. A growing number of energy experts agree. \u201cOver the next decade we\u2019ll see a far quicker than expected rollout of a number of clean energy technologies, which will almost certainly mean global emissions plateau,\u201d Liebreich adds. The rollout is expected whether politicians increase their ambition or not, because the economics of clean energy are now too strong to ignore. Earlier this summer, BNEF reported that not only was renewable energy cheaper than building a new gas or coal plant, but it would soon be cheaper than using existing thermal plants too. This economic tipping point means it would save money to shut existing coal-fired power plants down and build new renewable energy projects from scratch. Abundant clean electricity could help remove the emissions from the world\u2019s transport and heating systems too. By 2030, BNEF expects demand for road fuels to peak, while coal is expected to peak by 2026. DNV GL, a global energy advisory, believes that by the same year oil will no longer be the world\u2019s biggest energy source, and by the end of the 2020s the world\u2019s demand for crude will begin to fall. \u201cIt provides a lot of hope,\u201d says Seb Henbest, the lead author of the BNEF report. \u201cIt provides a counterbalance to the doom and gloom we face, partly because it includes up-to-date data which tells a slightly different story.\u201d It is a cautionary tale for fossil fuel companies that believe the world\u2019s demand for polluting energy will continue to rise until the middle of the century. It is also a new narrative of hope, he says. \u201cWe\u2019re a lot further on than we were. And yes, we need to go faster. And yes, it\u2019s difficult and complicated.

They decided that it looked like any other comet except that it came from beyond the solar system and would soon leave for good.</p> <p>The unusual body was spotted in August by a Crimean amateur astronomer, Gennady Borisov. It was swiftly identified as an outcast from another star system and may have been wandering the Milky Way for millions if not billions of years.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the first comet known to science that arrived from outside the solar system, and it is completely similar to those we see inside the solar system,\u201d said Michal Drahus, an astronomer at Jagiellonian University in Krakow, Poland.</p> <p>The team, led by Piotr Guzik, gathered images of the comet after receiving an alert from a computer system that detects cosmic interlopers.

      "bodyText": "The first interstellar comet to be tracked by astronomers as it hurtles through the solar system is unremarkable in every way apart from where it comes from, researchers have said. Scientists reached the conclusion after observing 2I/Borisov with two of the most powerful telescopes on Earth. They decided that it looked like any other comet except that it came from beyond the solar system and would soon leave for good. The unusual body was spotted in August by a Crimean amateur astronomer, Gennady Borisov. It was swiftly identified as an outcast from another star system and may have been wandering the Milky Way for millions if not billions of years. \u201cThis is the first comet known to science that arrived from outside the solar system, and it is completely similar to those we see inside the solar system,\u201d said Michal Drahus, an astronomer at Jagiellonian University in Krakow, Poland. The team, led by Piotr Guzik, gathered images of the comet after receiving an alert from a computer system that detects cosmic interlopers. Unlike comets and asteroids that formed in the solar system, the arrivals are on trajectories that do not swing around the sun. Pictures from the William Herschel Telescope on La Palma, Spain, and the Gemini North telescope on Mauna Kea, Hawaii, revealed that 2I/Borisov has a coma \u2013 a billowing cloud of dust and gas that surrounds a comet\u2019s nucleus \u2013 and a short, fat tail. Both are created when ices on the comet\u2019s surface sublimate into gas and blast dust and vapour into space. Details are published in Nature Astronomy. The observations confirmed that the reddish body is a comet with a nucleus about 2km wide. It is only the second interstellar body to be spotted in the solar system, after the apparently more rocky and cigar-shaped Oumuamua, which was tracked in 2017 as it barrelled out of the solar system at 196,000mph. Comets are what is left over when a planetary system forms, and the similarity of 2I/Borisov to solar system comets suggests our own planetary system is not unusual in the Milky Way. \u201cThe first thing it tells us is that at least some other planetary systems around other stars are similar to ours,\u201d said Guzik. Scientists are unsure where 2I/Borisov comes from, but another Polish research team has tentatively traced its trajectory back to a star system with twin red dwarves called Kruger 60, 13 light years from Earth. The new comet tore into the solar system several years ago from an angle of about 45 degrees north. In October 2015 it was as far away as Neptune, the outermost planet, and now it is between Mars and Jupiter. On 27 October it will cross the plane of Earth\u2019s orbit. The early detection means astronomers will be able to observe the 71,500mph comet as it makes its closest approach to the sun on 8 December, when the extra heat will make the comet more active and its tail longer. Colin Snodgrass, an astronomer at Edinburgh University and a member of a team that has separate observations of 2I/Borisov coming out in Astrophysical Journal Letters, said: \u201cThis appears to be a completely unremarkable comet on a very remarkable orbit.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s very interesting that this interstellar comet looks like our own ones,\u201d he added. \u201cIt implies that some of the formation processes we are trying to figure out with detailed observation of comets and asteroids, or space missions like Rosetta, are common between stars.\u201d A new mission being developed for the European Space Agency will send a robotic probe into space to intercept and study a passing comet. Geraint Jones, the head of planetary science at UCL Mullard Space Science Laboratory and the lead proposer of the Comet Interceptor mission, said the primary target would be a pristine, unaltered comet arriving fresh from the Oort cloud, a distant region of the solar system where comets reside. \u201cBut we on the proposing team made it clear that if an interstellar object could be reached instead, it would clearly make an extremely compelling target,\u201d he said.

A newly recognised condition, Panama Tunisia Sweden Disorder affects those who cannot get over the golden summer of 2018, when England beat three of world football\u2019s powerhouses en route to the World Cup semi-final. It seems we\u2019re not the only one with it, because there are reports that, when England face Bulgaria on Monday, Gareth Southgate will return to a back three! First, he will apply his boot up the back of three players. At least one and possibly all of Michael Keane, Danny Rose (who is suspended) and Kieran Trippier will be removed from the side <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/11/czech-republic-england-euro-2020-qualifier-match-report\">that started on Friday</a>, with Tyrone Mings set to make his debut. It\u2019s a dramatic but not unreasonable response to another defensive performance that had them rolling in the aisles, and had The Fiver wondering whether Celebrity Masterchef finalist Neil Ruddock would be better demonstrating his BIG clearances on ITV than his BIG flavours on BBC1.</p> \n<p>A year ago, when Danny Welbeck suffered serious-gah, the England players placed a photo of him by the TV in their training camp. Bit weird, but at least they care about absent teammates. This season, they have paid tribute to the knacked John Stones by defending like ersatz Pruniers against Kosovo and the Czech Republic. It seems then that Southgate\u2019s answer to the lack of decent centre-halves is to pick more of them. England will qualify for Euro 2020 if they win and Kosovo fail to beat Montenegro. It\u2019s getting very tight, because England are down to their preantepenultimate chance of qualification. If they lose their last three games, and then a play-off, they\u2019ll be spending next summer at home. Or, perhaps, in a casino. That\u2019s where James Maddison <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/13/gareth-southgate-england-bulgaria-euro-2020-james-maddison\">went on Friday night</a>, having been sent home from the England camp because of fears that his virus would infect the rest of the squad.

There was no dentist\u2019s chair; he didn\u2019t steal a bracelet; he didn\u2019t cause \u00a35,000\u2019s worth of damage; and he wasn\u2019t so drunk that he didn\u2019t know his own name. The Sun, Britain\u2019s premier authority on behavioural standards, said Maddison\u2019s appearance at the casino \u201clooks rude and disrespectful\u201d. Indeed, there are rumours that Maddison cares so little about the England national team that he can\u2019t even name the XI, in correct formation, that drew 1-1 against Saudi Arabia in 1988.</p> \n<p>As ever, Southgate was a bit more mature about the whole thing. \u201cI don\u2019t really want to discuss individuals but I know pretty much everything about all of my players,\u201d he said, breathlessly reeling off the exact dimensions of Harry Maguire\u2019s slabhead, whether [name redacted] prefers wing or bre@st at KFC and whether Eric Dier\u2019s parents believe in nominative determinism. \u201cOnce a player has been released from the squad, then it\u2019s up to them how they spend their individual time,\u201d added Southgate. \u201cI guess what James has learned is that if you have an involvement with England, then there\u2019s an increased spotlight on you and increased interest in your personal and private life.\u201d And if you play at the back, as Mings will find out, there\u2019s an increased spotlight on whether you are actually any good at defending.</p> \n<h2>LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE</h2> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football\">Join Rob Smyth from 7.45pm for hot MBM coverage of Bulgaria 1-2 England</a>.</p> \n<h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> \n<p>\u201cI called a meeting with the players in the dressing room, explained the reasons I stayed away in bullet-point form and asked if anyone had any questions.

      "bodyText": "REALITY CHE \u2026 OH The Fiver is suffering from acute PTSD. A newly recognised condition, Panama Tunisia Sweden Disorder affects those who cannot get over the golden summer of 2018, when England beat three of world football\u2019s powerhouses en route to the World Cup semi-final. It seems we\u2019re not the only one with it, because there are reports that, when England face Bulgaria on Monday, Gareth Southgate will return to a back three! First, he will apply his boot up the back of three players. At least one and possibly all of Michael Keane, Danny Rose (who is suspended) and Kieran Trippier will be removed from the side that started on Friday, with Tyrone Mings set to make his debut. It\u2019s a dramatic but not unreasonable response to another defensive performance that had them rolling in the aisles, and had The Fiver wondering whether Celebrity Masterchef finalist Neil Ruddock would be better demonstrating his BIG clearances on ITV than his BIG flavours on BBC1. A year ago, when Danny Welbeck suffered serious-gah, the England players placed a photo of him by the TV in their training camp. Bit weird, but at least they care about absent teammates. This season, they have paid tribute to the knacked John Stones by defending like ersatz Pruniers against Kosovo and the Czech Republic. It seems then that Southgate\u2019s answer to the lack of decent centre-halves is to pick more of them. England will qualify for Euro 2020 if they win and Kosovo fail to beat Montenegro. It\u2019s getting very tight, because England are down to their preantepenultimate chance of qualification. If they lose their last three games, and then a play-off, they\u2019ll be spending next summer at home. Or, perhaps, in a casino. That\u2019s where James Maddison went on Friday night, having been sent home from the England camp because of fears that his virus would infect the rest of the squad. Given their performance against the Czech Republic, etc, etc. As far as The Fiver is concerned, Maddison\u2019s behaviour was an egregious affront to the proud history of the England national team. There was no dentist\u2019s chair; he didn\u2019t steal a bracelet; he didn\u2019t cause \u00a35,000\u2019s worth of damage; and he wasn\u2019t so drunk that he didn\u2019t know his own name. The Sun, Britain\u2019s premier authority on behavioural standards, said Maddison\u2019s appearance at the casino \u201clooks rude and disrespectful\u201d. Indeed, there are rumours that Maddison cares so little about the England national team that he can\u2019t even name the XI, in correct formation, that drew 1-1 against Saudi Arabia in 1988. As ever, Southgate was a bit more mature about the whole thing. \u201cI don\u2019t really want to discuss individuals but I know pretty much everything about all of my players,\u201d he said, breathlessly reeling off the exact dimensions of Harry Maguire\u2019s slabhead, whether [name redacted] prefers wing or bre@st at KFC and whether Eric Dier\u2019s parents believe in nominative determinism. \u201cOnce a player has been released from the squad, then it\u2019s up to them how they spend their individual time,\u201d added Southgate. \u201cI guess what James has learned is that if you have an involvement with England, then there\u2019s an increased spotlight on you and increased interest in your personal and private life.\u201d And if you play at the back, as Mings will find out, there\u2019s an increased spotlight on whether you are actually any good at defending. LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE Join Rob Smyth from 7.45pm for hot MBM coverage of Bulgaria 1-2 England. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cI called a meeting with the players in the dressing room, explained the reasons I stayed away in bullet-point form and asked if anyone had any questions. That was their time to say something, face to face. All the guys who said something when I was away stayed quiet. Only one person, Geoff Thomas, said he didn\u2019t agree with me.

But what we are facing now is 27 different solutions,\u201d she said. \u201cIn effect it is a European postcode lottery, and rather than our EU rights being safeguarded at an EU level, our rights are being outsourced to the 27 countries.\u201d</p> <p>Kalba Meadows, a psychotherapist who lives and works in France, said the biggest problem facing Britons in her adopted country was its six-month grace period after Brexit day for fresh applications to be made.</p> <p>She said: \u201cIt\u2019s one of the shortest in the EU27, which is surprising when you take into account that France is the only EU27 state that doesn\u2019t require registration of EU citizens, so it\u2019s a case of starting from scratch, unlike, say, Germany or Spain where everyone should already be registered. It\u2019s hard to see, frankly, how 150,000 to 200,000 people are going to be able to register within such a short timescale, even in a perfect world.\u201d</p> <p>Meadows added: \u201cWe know that there are thousands of British residents out there who haven\u2019t yet been reached, either by us or by the embassy\u2019s publicity campaigns, so there\u2019s a huge amount of work to be done and it needs to be done fast. Then there\u2019s the issue of those who are especially vulnerable \u2013 those who are ill, very elderly, live alone, have no internet or no transport, those in care homes, those under <em>tutelle</em> [power of attorney] and so on.\u201d</p> <p>Boris Johnson has said the UK will leave the EU on 31 October, \u201cno ifs or buts\u201d, and it looks increasingly unlikely that a deal will be secured with Brussels at a summit this Thursday.</p> <p>A UK government spokesperson said: \u201cThe government has given an unequivocal guarantee to EU citizens living and working in the UK that they can have absolute certainty of the right to live and remain in the UK after Brexit. We continue to urge all member states to reciprocate fully for UK nationals the guarantee that we have made to EU citizens.\u201d</p>",

Grace periods for late applications range from three months after Brexit day in Germany \u2013 although that initial proposal is set to be extended to nine months when finally legislated \u2013 to three years for those living in Hungary. Jane Golding, the chair of the lobby group British in Europe, said her members were now pushing for an EU-wide solution to be ringfenced in the event of Britain\u2019s membership of the bloc being extended beyond 31 October. \u201cIf there had been a ringfenced solution, in a no-deal scenario you would have an EU-wide solution. But what we are facing now is 27 different solutions,\u201d she said. \u201cIn effect it is a European postcode lottery, and rather than our EU rights being safeguarded at an EU level, our rights are being outsourced to the 27 countries.\u201d Kalba Meadows, a psychotherapist who lives and works in France, said the biggest problem facing Britons in her adopted country was its six-month grace period after Brexit day for fresh applications to be made. She said: \u201cIt\u2019s one of the shortest in the EU27, which is surprising when you take into account that France is the only EU27 state that doesn\u2019t require registration of EU citizens, so it\u2019s a case of starting from scratch, unlike, say, Germany or Spain where everyone should already be registered. It\u2019s hard to see, frankly, how 150,000 to 200,000 people are going to be able to register within such a short timescale, even in a perfect world.\u201d Meadows added: \u201cWe know that there are thousands of British residents out there who haven\u2019t yet been reached, either by us or by the embassy\u2019s publicity campaigns, so there\u2019s a huge amount of work to be done and it needs to be done fast. Then there\u2019s the issue of those who are especially vulnerable \u2013 those who are ill, very elderly, live alone, have no internet or no transport, those in care homes, those under tutelle [power of attorney] and so on.\u201d Boris Johnson has said the UK will leave the EU on 31 October, \u201cno ifs or buts\u201d, and it looks increasingly unlikely that a deal will be secured with Brussels at a summit this Thursday. A UK government spokesperson said: \u201cThe government has given an unequivocal guarantee to EU citizens living and working in the UK that they can have absolute certainty of the right to live and remain in the UK after Brexit. We continue to urge all member states to reciprocate fully for UK nationals the guarantee that we have made to EU citizens.\u201d",

Nor, for that matter, is there much in the way of overarching plot: Jesse spends most of his time trying to flee Albuquerque, attempting to remain hidden in plain sight as he deals with a handful of unforeseen obstacles, as well as a severe case of PTSD.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JLUn2DFW4w\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1JLUn2DFW4w?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>This structure, combined with numerous lengthy flashbacks (all of which, it should be noted, are new scenes), makes El Camino feel less like a standalone film than three slightly truncated episodes of Breaking Bad stacked back-to-back.

While it\u2019s far too intense a thriller to be considered a classic <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/watching/lists/hangout-movies\">hangout movie</a>, it nonetheless operates on a similar level.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b9a65ab4593b6ad2ac9aa53f010cf021a0c05021\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b9a65ab4593b6ad2ac9aa53f010cf021a0c05021/0_56_4020_2412/1000.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>That it succeeds at all without engaging in any annoying story retconning or cheap fan service (the closest it comes is allowing Jesse one utterance of \u201cBitch!\u201d, although even that is entirely justified by the context) is a further testament to its quality. I predict the film\u2019s esteem will only rise in coming years, once it\u2019s further removed from preconceived notions and expectations that immediately preceded it.</p> <h2><strong>Who\u2019s back?</strong></h2> <p>We knew from the trailers and teasers that a few recurring characters from Breaking Bad would be returning alongside Jesse \u2013 namely, his ne\u2019er-do-well homeboys Badger (Matt L Jones) and Skinny Pete (Charles Baker), as well as fan favorite Old Joe (Larry Hankin), the wily salvage yard owner who\u2019d helped Jesse and Walt out of several a tight spot in the past.</p> <p>The irascible Badger and Old Joe make the most of their short time on screen, but it\u2019s Skinny Pete who leaves the biggest impression, his unwavering loyalty to his friend, who he movingly calls his hero (and shit) transforming him into the heart of the film and garnering <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=skinny%2520pete&amp;src=typeahead_click\">the biggest reaction</a> on social media.</p> <p>Beyond those three lovable scoundrels, it was an open question as to who else might make an appearance. Of the surviving characters, it seemed unlikely any of the extended White family would pop up, given they rarely, if ever, interacted with Jesse. Indeed, that turned out to be the case. The movie does, however, give Jesse the chance to say a proper goodbye to his own long-suffering parents (Tess Harper and Michael Bofshever) in a moving scene that mirrors Walt\u2019s final goodbye to Skylar from the season finale. Rather than simply apologize, Jesse takes responsibility for his actions, thereby lessening the moral burden of his loved ones (though he also manipulates them one final time).</p> <p>Aside from one other surviving character who plays a large part and a couple of brief cameos (a pair of government officials from Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul), the remainder of the reunions are given over to deceased characters by way of flashbacks.</p> <p>Two such scenes serve as the film\u2019s bookends: in the first, Jesse\u2019s doomed mentor Mike Ehrmantraut (Jonathan Banks) gives him the idea to move to Alaska, while warning him that he\u2019ll never be able to truly start fresh. In the second, his similarly doomed lover (and fellow Walt murder victim) Jane Margolis (Krysten Ritter) talks to him about the nature of the universe and the necessity of deciding one\u2019s own path. Both scenes inform Jesse\u2019s path forward and hint at a future where, even if he\u2019s unlikely to find full redemption, he might be able to live without the ghosts of his past continually weighing him down.</p> <p>Of all those ghosts, Walter White continues to loom the largest. In El Camino, his name is only mentioned a handful of times, always over news reports (which, by the way, 100% confirm his death, thereby shutting down any remaining fan theories that he somehow survived the events of the finale), although he does eventually appear in a flashback towards the end of the film.</p> <p>Set shortly after their <a href=\"https://breakingbad.fandom.com/wiki/4_Days_Out\">near demise</a> in the middle of the desert during season two, Walt and Jesse commiserate over lunch at a motel buffet, Walt attempting to convince Jesse to use his cut from their big score to get an education, and telling him he\u2019s lucky he didn\u2019t have to wait until the end of his life to make something of himself. It\u2019s one of the most somber scenes in the entirety of Breaking Bad, and a touching reminder that, for as much pain and suffering as he inflicted on his former student and business partner, he also truly did love him.</p> <h2><strong>The Todd show</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d2c42de77808032d134d384c6c362e5e90892c71\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d2c42de77808032d134d384c6c362e5e90892c71/0_59_2727_1636/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jesse Plemons at the premiere of El Camino.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jesse Plemons at the premiere of El Camino.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christian Monterrosa/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Much to my (and probably many others\u2019) surprise, the deceased character we spend the most time with is Todd Alquist (Jesse Plemons), the cherub-faced, even-keeled psychopath responsible for so much of Jesse\u2019s personal torment. The majority of the film\u2019s middle section recounts a funny but disturbing misadventure that occurred during the months of Jesse\u2019s captivity, where Todd brought him along to help dispose of the corpse of his cleaning lady, who he strangled to death after she stumbled upon his hidden stash of cash.</p> <p>The casual nature with which Todd goes about the process of removing her cadaver from his cozy apartment \u2013 treating the whole thing as though they were moving a couch \u2013 displays Gilligan\u2019s superb talent for writing pitch-black comedy of the noir-slapstick variety (the whole thing feels very Coen brothers-y in the best way, doesn\u2019t it)? And just as in the latter seasons of Breaking Bad, Plemons steals the show by creating one of the most unnerving, yet oddly sympathetic monsters in modern pop culture.</p> <p>I think we can all agree that should Gilligan wish to give us another Breaking Bad prequel in the near future, it should cover the heretofore unseen adventures of Todd. (Also, if I might indulge in a little bit of fantasy casting, Plemons proves here that he should play the lead in Yorgos Lanthimos\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/yorgos-lanthimos-sets-next-project-jim-thompson-adaptation-pop-1280-1189161\">upcoming</a> adaptation of Jim Thompson\u2019s hardboiled serial killer satire Pop. 1280.)</p> <h2><strong>Kandy and co</strong></h2> <p>One of Breaking Bad\u2019s greatest strengths was the way it introduced its motley crew of villains, laying the ground work for their eventual confrontation with Walt/Jesse.

I thought they made for great antagonists in the Elmore Leonard tradition \u2013 just ruthless enough to pose a serious threat, but ultimately too shortsighted and small-minded to come out on top (MacArthur seems to be a natural playing this type, as evidenced by his similar turn on HBO\u2019s The Righteous Gemstones).</p> <p>I\u2019ve seen some criticism that they felt lightweight, especially in contrast to the likes of Todd or Gustavo Fringe, but I think that\u2019s kind of the point: they\u2019re that final, stubborn obstacle standing in Jesse\u2019s way. The fact he is able to dispatch them so easily (and cold-bloodedly) shows that, whether he wants to admit it or not, Walt truly was a great teacher, and Jesse a great student.</p> <h2><strong>RIP Robert Forster</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a463655964e034b7c009a2ef73636e2ae2c70cd4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a463655964e034b7c009a2ef73636e2ae2c70cd4/127_0_1715_1029/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Robert Forster died last week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Robert Forster died last week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Finally, El Camino took on an unexpectedly melancholy dimension due to the death of actor Robert Forster the same day of its release.

      "bodyText": "The past weekend saw the much-anticipated release of El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie on Netflix. As we knew from August\u2019s press release and teaser, plus a couple of trailers and clips released since, the film would trace remorseful meth dealer Jesse Pinkman\u2019s (Aaron Paul) flight from captivity and personal reckoning following the events of Breaking Bad\u2019s 2013 finale. Beyond that, we weren\u2019t given much in the way of details, which led many to wonder exactly what shape the film would take, as well as what, if any, surprises it held for the show\u2019s surviving characters, dangling plot threads and existing mythology. When it dropped on Friday at midnight, diehard fans took to the film like it were a fresh batch of Blue, and now that everyone else has had time to catch up, we can delve into some of the film\u2019s key moments and biggest talking points. Sequel, spin-off or postscript? Despite the title of the film \u2013 El Camino is a reference to Jesse\u2019s getaway car, which also translates in English to \u201cthe way\u201d \u2013 the film is neither a road film nor a chase movie. Nor, for that matter, is there much in the way of overarching plot: Jesse spends most of his time trying to flee Albuquerque, attempting to remain hidden in plain sight as he deals with a handful of unforeseen obstacles, as well as a severe case of PTSD. This structure, combined with numerous lengthy flashbacks (all of which, it should be noted, are new scenes), makes El Camino feel less like a standalone film than three slightly truncated episodes of Breaking Bad stacked back-to-back. This isn\u2019t necessarily negative \u2013 if these had been episodes of the series they\u2019d rank among the very best \u2013 but it does give the film a slightly off-kilter rhythm. Meanwhile, some Breaking Bad fans might be disappointed by El Camino\u2019s relatively low-key stakes, at least compared to the epic scale of Breaking Bad\u2019s latter seasons, though they are probably in the minority: all of the major set pieces retain the tight, intelligent plotting and nigh-unbearable tension we\u2019ve come to expect from writer-director Vince Gilligan, while the unbroken focus on Jesse provides an emotional catharsis that greatly adds to the larger Breaking Bad canon. But was it necessary? While El Camino has received strong reviews, one talking point that keeps popping up is the notion that since it doesn\u2019t throw any big twists our way, or even really expand on what we probably surmised at the end of the original series re Jesse\u2019s fate, the film is somehow unnecessary. Even without diving into a larger discussion about the necessity of any individual film, such criticism still reads as bogus: El Camino gives us the opportunity to re-enter a world we\u2019ve come to love and to catch up with characters we\u2019ve missed. While it\u2019s far too intense a thriller to be considered a classic hangout movie, it nonetheless operates on a similar level. That it succeeds at all without engaging in any annoying story retconning or cheap fan service (the closest it comes is allowing Jesse one utterance of \u201cBitch!\u201d, although even that is entirely justified by the context) is a further testament to its quality. I predict the film\u2019s esteem will only rise in coming years, once it\u2019s further removed from preconceived notions and expectations that immediately preceded it. Who\u2019s back? We knew from the trailers and teasers that a few recurring characters from Breaking Bad would be returning alongside Jesse \u2013 namely, his ne\u2019er-do-well homeboys Badger (Matt L Jones) and Skinny Pete (Charles Baker), as well as fan favorite Old Joe (Larry Hankin), the wily salvage yard owner who\u2019d helped Jesse and Walt out of several a tight spot in the past. The irascible Badger and Old Joe make the most of their short time on screen, but it\u2019s Skinny Pete who leaves the biggest impression, his unwavering loyalty to his friend, who he movingly calls his hero (and shit) transforming him into the heart of the film and garnering the biggest reaction on social media. Beyond those three lovable scoundrels, it was an open question as to who else might make an appearance. Of the surviving characters, it seemed unlikely any of the extended White family would pop up, given they rarely, if ever, interacted with Jesse. Indeed, that turned out to be the case. The movie does, however, give Jesse the chance to say a proper goodbye to his own long-suffering parents (Tess Harper and Michael Bofshever) in a moving scene that mirrors Walt\u2019s final goodbye to Skylar from the season finale. Rather than simply apologize, Jesse takes responsibility for his actions, thereby lessening the moral burden of his loved ones (though he also manipulates them one final time). Aside from one other surviving character who plays a large part and a couple of brief cameos (a pair of government officials from Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul), the remainder of the reunions are given over to deceased characters by way of flashbacks. Two such scenes serve as the film\u2019s bookends: in the first, Jesse\u2019s doomed mentor Mike Ehrmantraut (Jonathan Banks) gives him the idea to move to Alaska, while warning him that he\u2019ll never be able to truly start fresh. In the second, his similarly doomed lover (and fellow Walt murder victim) Jane Margolis (Krysten Ritter) talks to him about the nature of the universe and the necessity of deciding one\u2019s own path. Both scenes inform Jesse\u2019s path forward and hint at a future where, even if he\u2019s unlikely to find full redemption, he might be able to live without the ghosts of his past continually weighing him down. Of all those ghosts, Walter White continues to loom the largest. In El Camino, his name is only mentioned a handful of times, always over news reports (which, by the way, 100% confirm his death, thereby shutting down any remaining fan theories that he somehow survived the events of the finale), although he does eventually appear in a flashback towards the end of the film. Set shortly after their near demise in the middle of the desert during season two, Walt and Jesse commiserate over lunch at a motel buffet, Walt attempting to convince Jesse to use his cut from their big score to get an education, and telling him he\u2019s lucky he didn\u2019t have to wait until the end of his life to make something of himself. It\u2019s one of the most somber scenes in the entirety of Breaking Bad, and a touching reminder that, for as much pain and suffering as he inflicted on his former student and business partner, he also truly did love him. The Todd show Much to my (and probably many others\u2019) surprise, the deceased character we spend the most time with is Todd Alquist (Jesse Plemons), the cherub-faced, even-keeled psychopath responsible for so much of Jesse\u2019s personal torment.

      "body": "<p>\u201cWe\u2019re making creative games for creative people, so there\u2019s no specific target market,\u201d says Siobhan Reddy, director at Media Molecule, the studio behind lauded games LittleBigPlanet and Dreams. \u201cThere\u2019s no ages, genders, or ethnicities. It is people, it is human.\u201d</p> <p>For some, that might be a surprising approach. For decades, the \u201cteenage-boy-in-his-bedroom\u201d stereotype has dominated mainstream understanding of who games are for. But as Media Molecule\u2019s whimsical output has proved, games have the potential for incredible variety. Media Molecule has carved a gaming niche centred around user-generated content, and its latest project, Dreams, is a game about making games. You could build a level filled with pianos, an elaborate first-person shooter, or spend hours sculpting the smooth yolk of your own fried egg \u2013 which other players can snaffle for use in their own projects.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I first went into a games studio the thing that struck me was all the different types of people,\u201d says Reddy. \u201cThe animation area was full of movement, the sound area filled with people buried in headphones, and the programming area was quiet and intense. [It\u2019s] like walking into a dance studio, and there\u2019s a floor where students are learning jazz, and the next one ballet, and you get this sense that everyone\u2019s there for a similar thing but they\u2019ve got different ways into it.\u201d</p> <p>Reddy mused on how gaming combined technology, art, literature, theatre and more into one melting pot, and it was then she realised her studio needed to be a melting pot too. Only by having a team made up of men, women, different ethnicities, and all sexualities would Media Molecule be able to create projects that speak to gaming\u2019s varied nature and audience.</p> <p>To do so wouldn\u2019t be straightforward. While<a href=\"https://ukie.org.uk/research#demographics\"> 48% of mobile gamers in the UK are female</a>, current statistics suggest that women make up just<a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/453634/game-developer-gender-distribution-worldwide/\"> 21% of game </a>developers globally. Across the world, development teams don\u2019t reflect their player base.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cc398ea996c77fad11455b69cbe06c5d65aacea5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cc398ea996c77fad11455b69cbe06c5d65aacea5/0_0_1669_1669/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Siobhan Reddy, director of games studio, Media Molecule.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Siobhan Reddy, director of games studio, Media Molecule.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sam Hendel</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But statistics can change with the right push, and so she set out to build a broad church to create visionary games, in a process that would involve much self-reflection. Reddy recalls how in the studio\u2019s early years meetings would often last hours, so she\u2019d ensure her small team was well-fuelled. As everyone settled in their chairs, she took it upon herself to carefully pour steaming tea into nine mugs.</p> <p>Until the day she didn\u2019t. There was no real reason, she just decided not to.

      "bodyText": "\u201cWe\u2019re making creative games for creative people, so there\u2019s no specific target market,\u201d says Siobhan Reddy, director at Media Molecule, the studio behind lauded games LittleBigPlanet and Dreams. \u201cThere\u2019s no ages, genders, or ethnicities. It is people, it is human.\u201d For some, that might be a surprising approach. For decades, the \u201cteenage-boy-in-his-bedroom\u201d stereotype has dominated mainstream understanding of who games are for. But as Media Molecule\u2019s whimsical output has proved, games have the potential for incredible variety. Media Molecule has carved a gaming niche centred around user-generated content, and its latest project, Dreams, is a game about making games. You could build a level filled with pianos, an elaborate first-person shooter, or spend hours sculpting the smooth yolk of your own fried egg \u2013 which other players can snaffle for use in their own projects. \u201cWhen I first went into a games studio the thing that struck me was all the different types of people,\u201d says Reddy. \u201cThe animation area was full of movement, the sound area filled with people buried in headphones, and the programming area was quiet and intense. [It\u2019s] like walking into a dance studio, and there\u2019s a floor where students are learning jazz, and the next one ballet, and you get this sense that everyone\u2019s there for a similar thing but they\u2019ve got different ways into it.\u201d Reddy mused on how gaming combined technology, art, literature, theatre and more into one melting pot, and it was then she realised her studio needed to be a melting pot too. Only by having a team made up of men, women, different ethnicities, and all sexualities would Media Molecule be able to create projects that speak to gaming\u2019s varied nature and audience. To do so wouldn\u2019t be straightforward. While 48% of mobile gamers in the UK are female, current statistics suggest that women make up just 21% of game developers globally. Across the world, development teams don\u2019t reflect their player base. But statistics can change with the right push, and so she set out to build a broad church to create visionary games, in a process that would involve much self-reflection. Reddy recalls how in the studio\u2019s early years meetings would often last hours, so she\u2019d ensure her small team was well-fuelled. As everyone settled in their chairs, she took it upon herself to carefully pour steaming tea into nine mugs. Until the day she didn\u2019t. There was no real reason, she just decided not to. There was a pause as the rest of her mostly male team waited patiently for her to perform the daily ritual. \u201cI got a bit annoyed about it,\u201d Reddy remembers. \u201cBut then afterwards I realised they had never expected me to pour the tea. I had set this behaviour in motion that I had to change.\u201d This got her thinking about other mundane \u201cinvisible work\u201d that the women around her are silently assuming \u2013 picking up the phone, answering the door \u2013 on top of their contracted jobs.

And, through some kind of red-button option, viewers at home would be able to decide whether they wanted to watch a match with the laser lines and other data on display \u2013 somewhat in the manner of the course and wind overlays in the America\u2019s Cup telecasts \u2013 or au naturel. Everybody wants accurate decisions and there is certainly an audience for more detailed analysis. But once this television-influenced path has been chosen, it is impossible to know where the journey will end, or what effect it will have on the uncertainty, the wonder, the exhilaration and the arguments that made sport more than a thing of statistics. But at least as long as Simone Biles is around, the wonder and the exhilaration are guaranteed.",

We have been in contact with the family\u2019s attorneys and look forward to hearing from them.\u201d Speaking to Sky News on Monday, Radd Seiger, a spokesman for the parents, said Sacoolas needed to present herself to Northamptonshire police and \u201clet the process go where it may\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re very clear there\u2019s not much point in meeting and having pleasantries if that commitment isn\u2019t there,\u201d he said. Lawyers advising Dunn\u2019s family have disputed whether or not Sacoolas ever had a right to diplomatic immunity. The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, wrote to them on Saturday to say Sacoolas\u2019s immunity was now irrelevant. \u201cWe have pressed strongly for a waiver of immunity, so that justice can be done \u2026 Whilst the US government has steadfastly declined to give that waiver, that is not the end of the matter,\u201d the letter read. \u201cWe have looked at this very carefully \u2026 the UK government\u2019s position is that immunity, and therefore any question of waiver, is no longer relevant in Mrs Sacoolas\u2019s case, because she has returned home. The US have now informed us that they too consider that immunity is no longer pertinent.\u201d Dunn\u2019s parents are considering pursuing Sacoolas in the US courts for a civil claim. In a statement released before they travelled to the US, they said they \u201ccontinue to live in a nightmare\u201d and have so far been unable to grieve after his death. They have set up a GoFundMe page to support their efforts.",

In less than a decade, they have worked with local partners in a wide range of countries on nearly 240 trials. As Duflo put it in a <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/esther_duflo_social_experiments_to_fight_poverty.html\">Ted lecture</a>, much of development policy has until now been on a par with medieval medicine \u2013 doing things based on habit, a hunch or misplaced belief \u2013 and she once likened development interventions as rather like using leeches. She maintains that she can take the \u201cguesswork out of policy making\u201d.</p> <p>Some don\u2019t like the ethics of handing out bednets in one village and not the next, but Duflo and Banerjee\u2019s argument is that we need to know what works and why, rather than the scattergun assumptions we have relied on up to now. Should the bednets be free or sold for a small fee? They talk of development as an \u201caccumulation of small steps, each well thought out, carefully tested and judiciously implemented\u201d.</p> <p>There is a huge amount that is positive here. How can anyone object to using rigorous evidence to make better policy? Furthermore, their research throws up all kinds of challenges to assumptions about how the poor behave and the choices they make. Ever wondered why there are so many half-built houses in developing countries? Answer: the poor save brick by brick. Slowly building a house can be their only way of saving because saving small amounts in banks is so expensive.</p> <p>There is some fascinating stuff here: take for example a chapter on how the poor make decisions about healthcare. Duflo and Banerjee point out that there are some very cheap health interventions which often the poor are reluctant to sacrifice the time or the money to get, for example oral rehydration salt and sugar for a sick baby. It\u2019s not that they don\u2019t care, because the research shows that they worry a lot about their family\u2019s health, nor is that they don\u2019t spend money on it \u2013 they do and more than one might expect. So the puzzling conclusion is that the poor spend money on expensive cures rather than cheap prevention: in Indian surveys, they prefer to go to private doctors who over-medicated (most often injections, drips and antibiotics); their healthcare was often unnecessary and even dangerous.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>But their approach is also controversial, because it blames poverty on three I\u2019s -- Ignorance, ideology and inertia.</strong> Some might argue that deep-seated problems in power structures, both political and domestic, matter too....</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/apr/11/duflo-banerjee-rethinking-fight-against-poverty\">Duflo and Banerjee take the guesswork out of policies that help the poor | Madeleine Bunting</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5da45ed38f084862358fdb62\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-14T11:50:45.149Z\">12.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/81804a1a-6d08-11e1-ab1a-00144feab49a\">Back in 2012, Esther Duflo had \u2018Lunch with the Financial Times</a>\u2019 - a popular interview format which often elicits more insights than a standard face-to-face.</strong></p> <p>The FT\u2019s John Gapper wrote:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> Duflo, raised in Paris, is one of three children whose mother, Violaine, instilled in them a sense of social justice. \u201cPart of me always wanted to do something useful for the world. It came from my mother. She is a paediatrician and she was active in a small NGO for the child victims of war. She used to travel to countries that had been through war and she would come back and show us slides to make us aware.\u201d</p> <p>She studied history with economics at the Ecole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure in Paris, an elite institution that turns out French academics and politicians, and the turning point came in her fourth year, spent in Russia. </p> </blockquote> <p>During her meal of French onion soup, Eggs Benedict and a decaf cappuccino, Duflo discussed her research on women in the developing world:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Despite cultural barriers, several studies have indicated that putting women in charge of decision-making, for example on village councils in India, makes it more likely that children will be well-fed and better educated. So would poverty be eradicated if it were a woman\u2019s world?</p> <p>Typically, Duflo has a hard-headed view \u2013 it might help but it wouldn\u2019t be enough by itself. \u201cIt is codified that women in Africa are in charge of getting food on the table so you get better outcomes for children when resources are transferred to women. But you cannot rely on women\u2019s empowerment to make us all rich and healthy.</p> </blockquote> <p>During the interview, Duflo -- then pregnant-- also explained she was taking US citizenship.... even though the food was better in France!

They wanted to find out which initiatives to raise educational standards actually worked.</p> <p>They examined free textbooks, flip charts, deworming children, school meals, and financial incentives for teachers if their pupils did well.</p> <p> These early studies illustrated the power and feasibility of focused field experiments. But they also offered substantive lessons. Given the context, simply providing more resources had a limited impact on school quality.</p> <p>Today\u2019s Nobel citation explains:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>More textbooks per student did not improve average test scores, but did improve test scores of the most able students. Giving flip charts to schools had no effect on student learning. The two health interventions reduced school absenteeism, but did not improve test scores. In theory, the incentive program could lead teachers either to increase effort to stimulate longterm learning or, alternatively, to teach to the test.</p> <p>The latter effect dominated. Teachers increased their efforts in test preparation, which raised test scores on exams linked to the incentives, but left test scores in unrelated exams unaffected.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5da44f5d8f084862358fda94\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-14T10:44:06.126Z\">11.44am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The Royal Swedish Academy have produced <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2019/10/popular-economicsciencesprize2019.pdf\">a \u2018popular science backgrounder\u2019 </a>to explain Banerjee, Duflo and Kremer\u2019s work on fighting poverty.</strong></p> <p>For example, it proved that healthcare initiatives were much more effective when medicine was provided for free:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A field experiment by Kremer and co-author investigated how the demand for deworming pills for parasitic infections was affected by price. They found that 75 per cent of parents gave their children these pills when the medicine was free, compared to 18 per cent when they cost less than a US dollar, which is still heavily subsidised. Subsequently, many similar experiments have found the same thing: poor people are extremely price-sensitive regarding investments in preventive healthcare.</p> <p>Low service quality is another explanation why poor families invest so little in preventive measures. One example is that staff at the health centres that are responsible for vaccinations are often absent from work. Banerjee, Duflo et al. investigated whether mobile vaccination clinics \u2013 where the care staff were always on site \u2013 could fix this problem. Vaccination rates tripled in the villages that were randomly selected to have access to these clinics, at 18% compared to 6%.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a74d609abc74d3bc004d9d6047c6b4a99e677a3d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a74d609abc74d3bc004d9d6047c6b4a99e677a3d/0_0_873_409/500.jpg\" alt=\"Nobel prize-winning research into poverty\" width=\"500\" height=\"234\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5da44d9c8f084862358fda7f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-14T10:34:43.793Z\">11.34am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The Royal Swedish Academy awards committee say they\u2019re optimistic that more female economists will be recognised in the future.</strong></p> <p>They point out that Esther Duflo won the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bates_Clark_Medal\">John Bates Clark Medal</a> for economists under 40 (often called the mini-Nobel) in 2010 -- that\u2019s a good clue to where future winners may come from.</p> <p>That\u2019s good news for this year\u2019s winner <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emi_Nakamura\">Emi Nakamura</a> (she\u2019s Professor of Economics at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Berkeley\">University of California, Berkeley</a>), and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Finkelstein\">Amy Finkelstein</a> of MIT (she won in 2012).</p> <p>The committee also dismisses any notion that Duflo won because she\u2019s a women - it\u2019s because her research is so good (as is Banerjee\u2019s and Kremer\u2019s, of course!).</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5da44cfd8f08b13ca7c7a231\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-14T10:26:44.775Z\">11.26am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><em>Q: What will you do with the prize money (the trio will share 9 million Swedish krona, or around \u00a3720,000)?</em></p> <p>Duflo says that when she was eight or nine, she read that Marie Curie had spent her first Nobel Prize money on equipment for further research into radiation.</p> <p>She hopes to do the equivalent for poverty research.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5da44c9f8f08b13ca7c7a22b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-14T10:23:34.667Z\">11.23am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NobelPrize/status/1183687164791590912\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">&quot;Showing that it is possible for a woman to succeed and be recognised for success I hope is going to inspire many, many other women to continue working and many other men to give them the respect they deserve.&quot;<br><br>- Esther Duflo at today&#39;s press conference announcing her prize. <a href=\"https://t.co/vTVBus80Hv\">pic.twitter.com/vTVBus80Hv</a></p>&mdash; The Nobel Prize (@NobelPrize) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NobelPrize/status/1183687164791590912?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 14, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5da44be18f083d8b3b9db7fe\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-14T10:23:12.887Z\">11.23am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><em>Q: What do you think about the risks from Brexit and trade wars?</em><br></p> <p>We live in turbulent times, hard times, Esther Duflo replies, telling us:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Many people in rich companies are worried about their position in the world.

The Anglo-Dutch laureate Sir Andre Geim joked that \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2012/oct/15/downsides-winning-nobel-prize\">journalists\u2019 questions</a>\u201d were one of the negatives.</p> <p>Another physics laureate, Brian Schmidt told New Scientist magazine: \u201cOne of the pitfalls of being a Nobel winner is that our voices are too loud when it comes to providing personal opinion \u2013 and in this respect, I need to be far more careful than I used to be about what I say and what I write.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>But at least you get your pick of bright students?

      "bodyText": "Time for a recap, as the \u201cNobel season\u201d comes to an end. Three economists have won the biggest prize in economics for their work into the causes of poverty, including only the second-ever female winner. The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel has been handed to Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo of Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Michael Kremer of Harvard. All three were recognised for their \u201cexperiment-based approach\u201d to tackling global poverty, and using randomised control trials to discover which educational outcomes or child health initiatives actually work. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences declared: The Laureates\u2019 research findings \u2013 and those of the researchers following in their footsteps \u2013 have dramatically improved our ability to fight poverty in practice. As a direct result of one of their studies, more than five million Indian children have benefitted from effective programmes of remedial tutoring in schools. Another example is the heavy subsidies for preventive healthcare that have been introduced in many countries. This post explains how Kremer conducted pioneering work with Kenyan schools in the mid-1990s, which was further developed by Duflo and Banerjee. This research showed how to raise vaccination rates and educational standards in schools, touching hundreds of millions of people across the globe. Although not an official Nobel prize, the Economics Sciences award is massive recognition for academic achievement - and comes with 9 million Swedish krona (\u00a3720,000) to share. French-born Esther Duflo said she was \u201cdeeply humbled\u201d by the news - which makes her the youngest ever laureate, and the second woman after Elinor Ostrom a decade ago. Speaking by phone moments after wining the award, Duflo also called on the economics profession to treat female colleagues with more respect, saying: We are a time when we are starting to realise in the profession that the way we conduct each other privately and publicly, is not conducive all the time to a very good environment for women. Showing that it is possible for a women to succeed, and to be recognised for success, I hope will inspire many many other women to continue working, and many many other men to give them the respect they deserve, like every single human being. Banerjee\u2019s mother has also expressed her pride in her son\u2019s work, using practical economics to tackle poverty. This popular science explainer is a good way to understand their work. This scientific explainer is a meatier guide to the issues Social media is abuzz with congratulations for today\u2019s trio, from fellow academics. Kaushik Basu, professor of economics at Cornell University, has hailed the creativity and impact of their work. Wharton economics professor Katherine Milkman tweets that all three have helped reduce poverty. Harvard assistant professor Peter Blair says Banerjee, Duflo and Kremer have all helped mentor academics in their field: Global development expert Cindy Huang has an example of how Duflo\u2019s work has shaped policy: Here\u2019s my colleague Philip Inman on today\u2019s award: The AFP have written a profile of Esther Duflo. Here\u2019s a flavour: Esther Duflo, one of three people awarded the Nobel Economics Prize on Monday, is a high-profile academic feted in the United States and her home country France for her hands-on approach to studying how people can escape the poverty trap. The 46-year-old professor, the youngest ever winner of the economics prize and only the second woman to gain the accolade, had been widely tipped since she picked up the prestigious John Bates Clark medal in 2010 which is often a first step to the Nobel award. But her age, gender and speciality - development economics - make her stand out among past recipients of the prize, who have traditionally been older, male and often American. She won the award with Indian-born Abhijit Banerjee of the US and Michael Kremer of the US, all hailed by the jury \u201cfor their experimental approach to alleviating global poverty\u201d. Duflo is married to Banerjee, who was her doctorate supervisor, and both are professors at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The economist made her name conducting research on poor communities in India and Africa, seeking to weigh the impact of policies such as incentivising teachers to show up for work or measures to empower women. Her tests, which have been likened to clinical trials for drugs, seek to identify and demonstrate which investments are worth making and have the biggest impact on the lives of the most deprived. \u201cOur vision of poverty is dominated by caricatures and cliches,\u201d she told AFP in an interview in September 2017 while discussing the aim of her fieldwork and research as a professor at MIT in Boston. \u201cWe need to understand the obstacles faced by the poorest and try to think about how we can help them move on,\u201d she said. Duflo is just as likely to be found out in the dusty and impoverished villages of northern India, where she has worked alongside local academics, as she is in the rarefied halls of US academia. French economist Thomas Piketty, whose Capital in the Twenty-First Century examines the causes of inequality, has tweeted his congratulations: Shobhini Mukerji of the South Asia branch of the Poverty Action Lab, in New Delhi (where Banerjee and Duflo conducted their work on poverty reduction) has welcomed the news. Mukerji says (via AFP). \u201cThis is huge for us.... India is where the seeds were sown for their research.\u201d Abhijit Banerjee\u2019s mother, Nirmala is also an economist -- a former professor at the Centre for Studies in Social Sciences, Calcutta. She\u2019s told Indian news channel NDTV that her son\u2019s focus is on practical economics. \u201cHe has been trying to get economics away from the theoretical part, but using theory to understand the world as it is. The way it works, the way poverty is, the way people handle poverty.\u201d However, Abhijit could be in hot water too, despite his success. His proud mother joked: \u201cI haven\u2019t spoken to my son (since the award was announced) but I did speak to him last night. He did not mention this then. I will tell him off... he should have told me about it\u201d. In his defence, Nobel prize winners only get a few minutes notice..... The randomised control trials (RCTs) at the heart of Duflo, Banerjee and Kramer\u2019s work aren\u2019t without critics. Splitting people randomly into groups is meant to allow researchers to change one variable (free healthcare, better funded schools, mosquito nets) and see the effect. Dr Shialaja Fennell, Senior Lecturer at the Centre of Development Studies at Cambridge University, cautions that RTCs shouldn\u2019t be treated as gospel: \u201cIt is good that the contribution of development economics has been recognised. However, it is important to note that experimental methods such [randomised controlled trials] RCTs and natural experiments, tend to estimate abstract efficacy instead of actual efficacy. The difference between these two types of efficacy arises due to a false assumption that a \u2018gold standard\u2019 of perfect identification is possible from the evidence obtained from the experiment. The evidence is then taken at face-value without due regard to the possibility of conceptual or ethical concerns.\u201d This blog post, on Brookings, points out that RTCs are better at measuring private goods (you either have it, or you don\u2019t), than public ones (say, the benefits of lower pollution). This blog post, on Oxfam, warns that creating truly randomised groups can be very hard - if, for example, people of a certain religion aren\u2019t happy to take part. Also, once you\u2019ve created your trial groups, it takes skill to properly implement the test - otherwise external factors can ruin the evidence. Back in 2011, Madeleine Bunting wrote about the importance of Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo\u2019s work: Duflo and Banerjee are most well known for their work through the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab, known as J-Pal, which has pioneered the use of randomised controlled trials to find out what works in development. In less than a decade, they have worked with local partners in a wide range of countries on nearly 240 trials. As Duflo put it in a Ted lecture, much of development policy has until now been on a par with medieval medicine \u2013 doing things based on habit, a hunch or misplaced belief \u2013 and she once likened development interventions as rather like using leeches. She maintains that she can take the \u201cguesswork out of policy making\u201d. Some don\u2019t like the ethics of handing out bednets in one village and not the next, but Duflo and Banerjee\u2019s argument is that we need to know what works and why, rather than the scattergun assumptions we have relied on up to now. Should the bednets be free or sold for a small fee? They talk of development as an \u201caccumulation of small steps, each well thought out, carefully tested and judiciously implemented\u201d. There is a huge amount that is positive here. How can anyone object to using rigorous evidence to make better policy? Furthermore, their research throws up all kinds of challenges to assumptions about how the poor behave and the choices they make. Ever wondered why there are so many half-built houses in developing countries? Answer: the poor save brick by brick. Slowly building a house can be their only way of saving because saving small amounts in banks is so expensive. There is some fascinating stuff here: take for example a chapter on how the poor make decisions about healthcare. Duflo and Banerjee point out that there are some very cheap health interventions which often the poor are reluctant to sacrifice the time or the money to get, for example oral rehydration salt and sugar for a sick baby. It\u2019s not that they don\u2019t care, because the research shows that they worry a lot about their family\u2019s health, nor is that they don\u2019t spend money on it \u2013 they do and more than one might expect. So the puzzling conclusion is that the poor spend money on expensive cures rather than cheap prevention: in Indian surveys, they prefer to go to private doctors who over-medicated (most often injections, drips and antibiotics); their healthcare was often unnecessary and even dangerous. But their approach is also controversial, because it blames poverty on three I\u2019s -- Ignorance, ideology and inertia. Some might argue that deep-seated problems in power structures, both political and domestic, matter too.... Back in 2012, Esther Duflo had \u2018Lunch with the Financial Times\u2019 - a popular interview format which often elicits more insights than a standard face-to-face. The FT\u2019s John Gapper wrote: Duflo, raised in Paris, is one of three children whose mother, Violaine, instilled in them a sense of social justice. \u201cPart of me always wanted to do something useful for the world. It came from my mother. She is a paediatrician and she was active in a small NGO for the child victims of war. She used to travel to countries that had been through war and she would come back and show us slides to make us aware.\u201d She studied history with economics at the Ecole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure in Paris, an elite institution that turns out French academics and politicians, and the turning point came in her fourth year, spent in Russia. During her meal of French onion soup, Eggs Benedict and a decaf cappuccino, Duflo discussed her research on women in the developing world: Despite cultural barriers, several studies have indicated that putting women in charge of decision-making, for example on village councils in India, makes it more likely that children will be well-fed and better educated. So would poverty be eradicated if it were a woman\u2019s world? Typically, Duflo has a hard-headed view \u2013 it might help but it wouldn\u2019t be enough by itself. \u201cIt is codified that women in Africa are in charge of getting food on the table so you get better outcomes for children when resources are transferred to women. But you cannot rely on women\u2019s empowerment to make us all rich and healthy. During the interview, Duflo -- then pregnant-- also explained she was taking US citizenship.... even though the food was better in France! As she put it: My child is going to be American..... And he [Banerjee] doesn\u2019t speak French, so I don\u2019t think he would like to go to France.\u201d Professor Costas Milas of Liverpool University tells me that all three winners are very highly regarded in their field: Based on data from 56,942 authors, RePEc (Research Papers in Economics; a central index of economics research available here) places all 3 Nobel Prize Winners in the top 1\u2030 in terms of the popularity of their research work. More specifically, in terms of Research Work by Number of Citations, Weighted by Recursive Impact Factors and Discounted by Citation Age, Esther Duflo is ranked 3rd worldwide. Abhijit Banerjee is ranked 163rd worldwide and Michael Kremer is ranked 260th worldwide. Professor Avner Offer of Oxford University has welcomed today\u2019s awards, saying: \u201cAn excellent prize this time. [It] is long overdue recognition for an important field and some of its very best practitioners. This field also constitutes a rejection of standard economic theory, which it invokes very little and often not at all.\u201d Offer has also co-written a history of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, which explains how the Swedish central bank created the award to promote market-friendly economics -- helping fuel the rise of market liberalism. Nat Dyer of PEP, a new economics organisation, has flagged up that this year\u2019s award is notable for several other reasons, as well as the second female winner. He says: Only second time poverty cited: the citation for this year\u2019s winners (\u201cfor their experimental approach to alleviating global poverty\u201d) is only the second time in the history of the economics prize that \u2018poverty\u2019 has been cited. The only other time was in 2015 with Angus Deaton [according to PEP analysis online here]. Only third BAME male to win: Abhijit Banerjee becomes only the third male who is not white to win the top prize in economics - the other two being - Arthur Lewis in 1979 and Amartya Sen in 1998. PEP (which stands for Promoting Economic Pluralism) also launched a \u2018Not the Nobel\u2019 prize this year. It was won by influential UCL Professor Mariana Mazzucato for her work \u2018reimagining the role of the state and value in economics\u2019. As Esther Duflo becomes just the second woman to be awarded the Nobel prize for economics in 50 years, a timely new campaign is being launched on Tuesday to increase diversity in the study of economics in the UK. Currently economics students are disproportionately male and privately educated - one in six boys studying for A-levels takes economics compared with just one in 17 girls. The subject is also more popular in private schools, with one in five pupils choosing economics A-level, compared to one in 12 in the state sector. A three-year-campaign, #DiscoverEconomics, led by the Royal Economic Society and supported by the Bank of England and the Institute for Fiscal Studies, is aiming to attract not just more women, but students from other under-represented groups, including ethnic minorities and students in further education colleges, in order to better reflect society. Stephanie Flanders, senior executive editor at Bloomberg and head of Bloomberg Economics, is backing the campaign: \u201cEconomics is far too important to be left to just one half of the population. Today we have women at the helm of key global institutions such as the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund and female chief economists in place at some of the world\u2019s largest banks. \u201cBut if you look behind these great role models, there are not so very many women coming up the ranks to succeed them. We need to develop a more reliable pipeline of young women entering the profession and I think this campaign could help.\u201d Clare Lombardelli, chief economic adviser at the Treasury, is also on board, saying: \u201cEconomics and economists are hugely influential \u2013 their analysis and advice shapes the world. We need the very best talent to solve today and tomorrow\u2019s challenges, such as the issues raised by climate change, an ageing society, changing technologies or how we improve wellbeing. \u201cThe economics profession is, and has always been, far too narrow. We need people with a wide range of backgrounds and perspectives \u2013 including people from all over the UK and from differing socio-economic backgrounds \u2013 to join the profession and play a part in tackling these issues.\u201d The campaign wants to change perceptions of economics and economists in order to broaden the appeal of the subject, working first with universities and employers and later in schools. You can really get to grips with Kremer, Duflo and Banerjee\u2019s work by reading this 41-page scientific explainer. It explains how the trio used empirical research to really dig into the causes of poverty, and to show in practices which policies actually work. The explainer says: While theory can pinpoint certain incentives, it does not tell us how powerful these are in practice. To give just a few examples, theory cannot tell us whether temporarily employing additional contract teachers with a possibility of re-employment is a more cost-effective way to raise the quality of education than reducing class sizes. Neither can it tell us whether microfinance programs effectively boost entrepreneurship among the poor. Nor does it reveal the extent to which subsidized health-care products will raise poor people\u2019s investment in their own health. Knowing the right quantitative answers to such specific questions is vital for enhancing human capital, increasing income, and improving health among the poor. Answering these questions requires an empirical approach that allows researchers to draw firm conclusions about causal effects. Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo (who, incidentally, are partners) took Kremer\u2019s work in Kenya, and proved that simply forcing children to spend more time in school didn\u2019t actually help tackle poverty. The Nobel committee explains: Banerjee, Duflo and their co-authors concluded that students appeared to learn nothing from additional days at school. Neither did spending on textbooks seem to boost learning, even though the schools in Kenya lacked many essential inputs. Moreover, in the Indian context Banerjee and Duflo intended to study, many children appeared to learn little: in results from field tests in the city of Vadodara fewer than one in five third-grade students could correctly answer first-grade curriculum math test questions. In response to such findings, Banerjee, Duflo and co-authors argued that efforts to get more children into school must be complemented by reforms to improve school quality. Michael Kremer\u2019s pioneering work in Kenya more than two decades ago has helped to transform development economics, winning him a share of today\u2019s Nobel prize. In the mid 1990s, Kremer\u2019s team ran a series of field experiments in western Kenya. They wanted to find out which initiatives to raise educational standards actually worked. They examined free textbooks, flip charts, deworming children, school meals, and financial incentives for teachers if their pupils did well. These early studies illustrated the power and feasibility of focused field experiments. But they also offered substantive lessons. Given the context, simply providing more resources had a limited impact on school quality. Today\u2019s Nobel citation explains: More textbooks per student did not improve average test scores, but did improve test scores of the most able students. Giving flip charts to schools had no effect on student learning. The two health interventions reduced school absenteeism, but did not improve test scores. In theory, the incentive program could lead teachers either to increase effort to stimulate longterm learning or, alternatively, to teach to the test. The latter effect dominated. Teachers increased their efforts in test preparation, which raised test scores on exams linked to the incentives, but left test scores in unrelated exams unaffected. The Royal Swedish Academy have produced a \u2018popular science backgrounder\u2019 to explain Banerjee, Duflo and Kremer\u2019s work on fighting poverty. For example, it proved that healthcare initiatives were much more effective when medicine was provided for free: A field experiment by Kremer and co-author investigated how the demand for deworming pills for parasitic infections was affected by price. They found that 75 per cent of parents gave their children these pills when the medicine was free, compared to 18 per cent when they cost less than a US dollar, which is still heavily subsidised. Subsequently, many similar experiments have found the same thing: poor people are extremely price-sensitive regarding investments in preventive healthcare. Low service quality is another explanation why poor families invest so little in preventive measures. One example is that staff at the health centres that are responsible for vaccinations are often absent from work. Banerjee, Duflo et al. investigated whether mobile vaccination clinics \u2013 where the care staff were always on site \u2013 could fix this problem. Vaccination rates tripled in the villages that were randomly selected to have access to these clinics, at 18% compared to 6%. The Royal Swedish Academy awards committee say they\u2019re optimistic that more female economists will be recognised in the future. They point out that Esther Duflo won the John Bates Clark Medal for economists under 40 (often called the mini-Nobel) in 2010 -- that\u2019s a good clue to where future winners may come from. That\u2019s good news for this year\u2019s winner Emi Nakamura (she\u2019s Professor of Economics at University of California, Berkeley), and Amy Finkelstein of MIT (she won in 2012). The committee also dismisses any notion that Duflo won because she\u2019s a women - it\u2019s because her research is so good (as is Banerjee\u2019s and Kremer\u2019s, of course!). Q: What will you do with the prize money (the trio will share 9 million Swedish krona, or around \u00a3720,000)? Duflo says that when she was eight or nine, she read that Marie Curie had spent her first Nobel Prize money on equipment for further research into radiation. She hopes to do the equivalent for poverty research. Q: What do you think about the risks from Brexit and trade wars? We live in turbulent times, hard times, Esther Duflo replies, telling us: Many people in rich companies are worried about their position in the world. They think they have lost their dignity and don\u2019t have the place in the world they deserve. That is probably at the root of much of the turmoil we are seeing. She suggests that using the techniques she, Banerjee and Kremer have used in the developing world could help explain problems in the developed world. Q: How does it feel to become the second women to win the Nobel prize for economics? Esther Duflo says she hopes to represent all the women in economics.... and then warns that the economics profession simply doesn\u2019t treat women well enough. She tells the Nobel prize committee that the \u2018environment\u2019 in economics needs to improve. We are a time when we are starting to realise in the profession that the way we conduct each other privately and publicly, is not conducive all the time to a very good environment for women. Showing that it is possible for a women to succeed, and to be recognised for success, I hope will inspire many many other women to continue working, and many many other men to give them the respect they deserve, like every single human being. Esther Duflo is on the phone now, from California (She and Banerjee, who are married, both work at MIT while Michael Kremer is at Harvard). She explains that the trio\u2019s work has focused on understanding the \u201cdeep, interconnected roots of poverty\u201d. Too often, policymakers can generalise about people in poverty, thinking they are completely desperate, or lazy, or entrepreneurial, without understanding the causes, she says. Our approach is to unpack the problems one by one, and examine them as scientifically as possible. Q: What\u2019s your reaction to winning? It\u2019s incredibly humbling, Duflo replies. She didn\u2019t believe that she (who is 46), Banerjee (58) and Kremer (54) would be in the running until they were significantly older. She add that the award also recognises hundreds of researchers who work on global poverty. It is a movement that is much larger than the three of us, she adds. Esther Duflo is also the youngest person to win the Nobel economics prize. The official announcement is online here. It explains that The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences has recognised Abhijit Banerjee, Esther Duflo, Michael Kremer for \u201cfor their experimental approach to alleviating global poverty\u201d. Despite recent dramatic improvements, one of humanity\u2019s most urgent issues is the reduction of global poverty, in all its forms. More than 700 million people still subsist on extremely low incomes. Every year, around five million children under the age of five still die of diseases that could often have been prevented or cured with inexpensive treatments. Half of the world\u2019s children still leave school without basic literacy and numeracy skills. This year\u2019s Laureates have introduced a new approach to obtaining reliable answers about the best ways to fight global poverty. In brief, it involves dividing this issue into smaller, more manageable, questions \u2013 for example, the most effective interventions for improving educational outcomes or child health. They have shown that these smaller, more precise, questions are often best answered via carefully designed experiments among the people who are most affected. In the mid-1990s, Michael Kremer and his colleagues demonstrated how powerful this approach can be, using field experiments to test a range of interventions that could improve school results in western Kenya. Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo, often with Michael Kremer, soon performed similar studies of other issues and in other countries. Their experimental research methods now entirely dominate development economics. Banerjee, Duflo and Kremer have won the Nobel Prize in economics for their experiment-based approach to tackling poverty -- in the fast-growing area of development economics . The key to their research is to take the daunting issue of global poverty, and break it down into smaller questions -- which can be more credibly answered. For example, to find ways to imprive children health you would examine various experimental approaches, such as education methods, health systems, agricultural approaches, and access to credit. Esther Duflo\u2019s success means we have a second female winner of the Nobel prize in economics, 50 years after it was first awarded. The first was Elinor Ostrom in 2009. The 2019 Prize in Economic Sciences has been awarded to Abhijit Banerjee, Esther Duflo and Michael Kremer for their work alleviating global poverty. Not long now! The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences has filled up, ready for the final Nobel prize of 2019 to be awarded. We\u2019ve added a live feed to the top of the blog - you might need to refresh the page to see it. Winning a Nobel prize changes someone\u2019s life, and not always in a good way. Seeing your life\u2019s work recognised must be a great feeling, and the money can\u2019t hurt either! But there are downsides -- including constant attention, and the danger that your every utterance suddenly carries rather more weight. As we wrote last week: Those who win a Nobel are often propelled from a quiet life running a laboratory or writing books to minor celebrity overnight. Invitations to give talks, attend parties and pronounce opinions on a wide variety of topics come flooding in. Some are thrilled to have a platform from which to raise political issues and gain access to politicians, business leaders and the media. For others, this comes as a downside. The Anglo-Dutch laureate Sir Andre Geim joked that \u201cjournalists\u2019 questions\u201d were one of the negatives. Another physics laureate, Brian Schmidt told New Scientist magazine: \u201cOne of the pitfalls of being a Nobel winner is that our voices are too loud when it comes to providing personal opinion \u2013 and in this respect, I need to be far more careful than I used to be about what I say and what I write.\u201d But at least you get your pick of bright students? No according to one chemistry Nobel winner, Martin Chalfie, who reported struggling to recruit students since winning the prize. Excitement is building, with just 30 minutes until the economics Nobel is awarded. Bloomberg\u2019s Noah Smith has come up with an impressive list of potential winners. 1) The New Keynesians: Economists who have examined causes of recessions, and explained how policymakers need to act when the business cycle deteriorates. There\u2019s plenty of possible options, including: Michael Woodford, Stanley Fischer, Greg Mankiw, Nobuhiro Kiyotaki, Olivier Blanchard, Guillermo Calvo, Janet Yellen and David Romer. 2) Claudia Goldin, for her work on equality. Smith explains: Goldin identifies increasing education as a key driver of the fall in U.S. inequality in the early 20th century, and blames a slowdown in educational attainment for the reversal of that happy trend. 3) David Card of the University of California-Berkeley. His landmark studies of low-skilled immigration and minimum wages proved that neither were particularly damaging to local workers. They also changed the way economists used data. 4) Paul Milgrom, for his theoretical work on game theory, contract theory, financial modelling, and more! Smith writes: The economics Nobel tends to favor the work of pure theorists who work on the deepest problems. And few thinkers dig deeper than Stanford University\u2019s Paul Milgrom. He was a major figure in the creation of auction theory -- probably the most empirically successful and practically useful economic theory of all time, which is now used to power everything from Google ads to federal spectrum auctions. 5) Daron Acemoglu of MIT, for his work on political economy, and why some nations succeed while others fail. His most important thesis is that social institutions are crucial for development and don\u2019t change much over time -- places that develop institutions based on exploiting labor and extracting resources tend to do badly over the centuries, while those that create more inclusive systems flourish. More recently, Acemoglu has tackled the question of whether automation will make humans obsolete. One female winner in 50 years really isn\u2019t good enough. And there are several women who could be recognised by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences today. One possibility is Esther Duflo, the MIT-based French-American economist. She and her partner Abhijit Banerjee have pioneered the use of randomized control trials to test the effectiveness of anti-poverty initiatives -- is it better to give people in the developing world food, or money? Harvard economist Claudia Goldin\u2019s work on the gender pay gap is also highly relevant. She\u2019s examined the high cost of women taking time out of the labour market in certain professions, and the cost of seeking jobs with more flexible hours or remote-work options. Princeton\u2019s Janet Currie is another option, for her work on healthcare issues such as insurance, nutrition and early intervention programs. As is Anne Osborn Krueger -- who showed how the wealthy can use \u2018rent-seeking\u2019 to become wealthier. And don\u2019t forget Katarina Juselius (see earlier post). Back in 2016, the FiveThirtyEight website calculated that: The typical winner of the Nobel in economics is a 67-year-old man, born in the United States, who is working at the University of Chicago when he wins.\u201d Little has changed subsequently, with five men in their 60s or 70s winning in the last three years (including Richard Thaler of Chicago). Here are some facts on the Economics Sciences prize, from Nobelprize.org: Number of Prizes in Economic Sciences 50 Prizes in Economic Sciences have been awarded every year since 1969. 25 Prizes in Economic Sciences have been given to one Laureate only. 19 Prizes in Economic Sciences have been shared by two Laureates. 6 Prizes in Economic Sciences have been shared between three Laureates. Number of Laureates in Economic Sciences 81 individuals have been awarded 1969-2018. Here\u2019s the full list Youngest Laureate in Economic Sciences Kenneth J. Arrow was just 51 years old when he was awarded in 1972. Oldest Laureate in Economic Sciences Leonid Hurwicz, who was 90 years old when he was awarded in 2007, which also makes him the oldest person to win any Nobel prize Female Laureates in Economic Sciences Elinor Ostrom became the first female Laureate in 2019, and is still the only one Here\u2019s 2017\u2019s winner, Richard Thaler, with some inspiring words for those who found academia a struggle  : Clarivate Analytics, a data provider, has produced a possible shortlist of candidates for today\u2019s award. By adding up academic citations, they\u2019ve worked out whose work is particularly highly regarded this year, making them worth winners. And the likely candidates are: W. Brian Arthur, professor at Santa Fe Institute, for his research exploring the consequences of increasing returns (or network effects) in economic systems. This shows how powerful players in a system can become more powerful over time. S\u00f8ren Johansen and Katarina Juselius, professors at the University of Copenhagen, for developing the cointegrated VAR (vector autoregressive) method for examining time-series data. It allows researchers to better examine short-run and long-run effects, and avoid \u2018confirmation bias\u2019. Ariel Rubinstein, Professor at the universities of Tel Aviv and New York University, for his work on economic theories and game theory. He developed an influential bargaining model, which shows how two players would negotiate to share a prize. My colleague Philip Inman has written more, here: Good morning. The final act of the 2019 Nobel Prize season is upon us. The biggest prize in the world of economics will be awarded this morning, to recognise outstanding contributions to the discipline. Of course, there isn\u2019t really a Nobel Prize for economics. Today\u2019s award is a late addition to the fold, created in 1969 by the Swedish central bank to mark its 300th anniversary. Critics, including some of the Nobel family, have criticised the award, suggesting it shouldn\u2019t be rubbing shoulders with Physics, Medicine, Chemistry, Literature and Peace. However, the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel has rewarded important work over the last half century, and has been awarded to some of the profession\u2019s most influential figures. It\u2019s not without controversy either. Many on the left would question how Milton Friedman picked up the award in 1976 for his work on monetarism, for example. And back in 1997, Robert Merton and Myron Scholes were hailed for their work determining the value of derivatives -- before such financial contracts helped to create the financial crisis. Last year, the prize went to William Nordhaus and Paul Romer. Nordhaus was recognised for his pioneering investigations into environmental economics, while Romer won for his work on the causes of economic growth (which helped inspire the endogenous growth theory beloved by former UK PM Gordon Brown). Other recent winners include Angus Deaton for his work on poverty (in 2015), Paul Krugman for trade patterns ( 2008), and Richard Thaler for \u2018nudge\u2019 economics (2017). As usual, there\u2019s no official shortlist, but that\u2019s no excuse not to speculate! The awards committee could lean towards environmental work again, given the climate emergency. They could recognise work on trade, given the disruption caused by the US-China trade war. They could look to the economics of inequality, or to financial economics. This year\u2019s winner will pick up 9 million Swedish krona, or around \u00a3720,000, which will be shared if two, or three, winners are selected. As with the other Nobel prizes, it can\u2019t be awarded posthumously. The agenda 10.45am BST: Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel",

      "body": "<p>Welcome to this week\u2019s blogpost. Here\u2019s our roundup of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2019/oct/07/tips-links-and-suggestions-what-are-you-reading-this-week\">your comments and photos </a>from last week.</p> <p>Let\u2019s start with some searching questions from <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/1942463\">Larts,</a> who<a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/1942463\"> </a>has been enjoying Warlight by Michael Ondaatje:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Ondaatje has the ability to draw me into the events of the novel but at the same time imbue scenes with mystery by leaving information out. As I read I have the sense of confusion and puzzlement - I am trying to piece events and characters together. It seems to be fragmentary and yet detailed, thoughtful yet careless.</p> <p>The novel has also made me realise, yet again, that I do not know the significance of certain people or events in my life. I dig around for that one moment, the moment in the rose garden. Perhaps it doesn\u2019t exist. People walk into and out of my life and I miss them, wonder what they\u2019re doing. Do they remember the things I remember? Do they think of me? That elusive meaning ... what is it? I don\u2019t often personalise the things I read - or do I?</p> </blockquote> <p>\u201cI\u2019m having a great old time reading Treasure Island,\u201d says <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16608465\">annegeraldine</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019m in love with David Livesey. He\u2019s a pipe smoking contemplative magistrate. He\u2019s a hands on medic true to his oath but also quick to show his swashybuckle side. His powdered wig is his emotional barometer, on and off like nobody\u2019s business ... when he is het up or in a pickle. If that wasn\u2019t enough he carries a chunk of parmesan in his snuff box. I mean, come on.</p> </blockquote> <p>Chernobyl by Serhii Plokhy has impressed <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/11940498\">fuzzywuzz</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It was not an easy read due to the subject material, but all the same, I\u2019m glad I did. The recent TV programme of the same name deviated somewhat from the book. Such a tragedy was the culmination of political pressure to exceed power output, operator error (inexperienced staff conducting a safety test which deviated from procedure, which was driven by a career climbing senior staff member) and withholding of pertinent safety issues surrounding the use of cheaper RBMK reactors (government level). When I finished the book, I came away with the feeling that human history has a tendency to repeat itself \u2013 economic/political success trumps the human cost of delivering such success.</p> </blockquote> <p>\u201cI have been rereading Pompeii from Robert Harris,\u201d says <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/13743934\">kristinezkochanski</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Some of it I could have done without, I don\u2019t really need a romantic plot to illustrate what is obvious. But it was fascinating to read about the importance of water, the corruption associated with providing it in those days, &amp; how the people in the bay just did not recognise what was happening with the mountain. The central character for me was Pliny who literally died because he could not stop being curious. He was also rather stupid at the same time. A great read.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16438100\">Rick2016 </a></strong>has updated us on a whole month of reading, starting with Yaa Gyasi\u2019s Homegoing:</p> <blockquote> <p>I thought that Homegoing was very good indeed; it surpassed my expectations. The novel tracks two branches of a family, ranging in setting from the Gold Coast as the slave trade is beginning to present day US. Each chapter is narrated by a new character, each a generation later than the last. I worried that this might be frustrating and stop me bonding with the characters but, in general, they were well-drawn and interesting enough for this not be a problem ... It\u2019s a first novel by a young author, so it\u2019s not all perfect, but I thought it was an excellent read and recommend it.</p> <p>Staying with racism infecting society (it\u2019s been a cheerful reading fortnight), I then read The Nowhere Man by Kamala Markandaya \u2026 it\u2019s a really good novel and quite nuanced in its portrayal; for every racist, there are several other people in the community who are well-meaning, albeit sometimes in a clumsy way \u2026 Markandaya\u2019s prose can be a bit strange at times, causing the odd stumble in the first few pages. But, once you\u2019re into the rhythm of it, she\u2019s a very good writer.</p> <p>Feeling somewhat gloomy about humanity after those two reads, I then read The Summer Book by Tove Janssen (a whimsical, funny, enjoyable read) and Petersburg Tales by Nikolai Gogol (well-written, humorous and pleasingly satirical of the pettiness of human aspirations), which provided a good balance and rounded out my month nicely.</p> </blockquote> <p>Finally, A Single Thread by Tracy Chevalier has appealed to <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16037784\">dihuet</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Set in 1932, it focusses on the lot of Violet, a 38-year-old so-called \u2018surplus woman\u2019, in her situation of struggling to cope with loss, to make ends meet on a low-income job (afford a warm meal) and to be independent. We read about her position in her family and her developing new friendships, as Violet and others gradually and quietly push back against societal constraints. What is particular is that the author paints a detailed picture of ecclesiastical activities (the crafts of embroidery and bell-ringing) at Winchester Cathedral, where Violet finds some comfort in the community of volunteer broderers working on a project to embroider kneelers for worshippers. The scenes are well set and enjoyable; the characters come to life. The ending gave me food for thought. I won\u2019t say anymore.</p> </blockquote> <p>That seems like a good place for us to pause too.</p> <h2><strong>Interesting links about books and reading</strong></h2> <ul> <li><p>The deep and lasting resonance of <a href=\"https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/goodnight-moon-almost-75-years-later/\">Goodnight Moon</a>.</p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.nypl.org/salinger?wpisrc=nl_books&amp;wpmm=1\">The JD Salinger exhibition</a> at The New York Public Library sounds incredible.</p></li> <li><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t faux praise and elevation of mediocrity just as patronizing as the dismissal of \u2018ethnic writing\u2019?\u201d Colin Grant <a href=\"https://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/public/publishingsowhite-diversity-literature/\">considers the anxieties and complexities</a> of furthering diversity in the literary world.</p></li> <li><p>I \u201chad a good experience\u201d with Giovanni Boccaccio\u2019s Decameron <a href=\"https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/page/2/\">says Anthony Madrid in The Paris Review</a>.</p></li> <li><p>Reading Gaol <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-berkshire-49911441\">is up for sale</a>.</p></li> </ul> <p>If you\u2019re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/guardianbooks/\">#GuardianBooks</a>, and we\u2019ll include a selection in this blog.

He\u2019s a pipe smoking contemplative magistrate. He\u2019s a hands on medic true to his oath but also quick to show his swashybuckle side. His powdered wig is his emotional barometer, on and off like nobody\u2019s business ... when he is het up or in a pickle. If that wasn\u2019t enough he carries a chunk of parmesan in his snuff box. I mean, come on. Chernobyl by Serhii Plokhy has impressed fuzzywuzz: It was not an easy read due to the subject material, but all the same, I\u2019m glad I did. The recent TV programme of the same name deviated somewhat from the book. Such a tragedy was the culmination of political pressure to exceed power output, operator error (inexperienced staff conducting a safety test which deviated from procedure, which was driven by a career climbing senior staff member) and withholding of pertinent safety issues surrounding the use of cheaper RBMK reactors (government level). When I finished the book, I came away with the feeling that human history has a tendency to repeat itself \u2013 economic/political success trumps the human cost of delivering such success. \u201cI have been rereading Pompeii from Robert Harris,\u201d says kristinezkochanski: Some of it I could have done without, I don\u2019t really need a romantic plot to illustrate what is obvious. But it was fascinating to read about the importance of water, the corruption associated with providing it in those days, &amp; how the people in the bay just did not recognise what was happening with the mountain. The central character for me was Pliny who literally died because he could not stop being curious. He was also rather stupid at the same time. A great read. Rick2016 has updated us on a whole month of reading, starting with Yaa Gyasi\u2019s Homegoing: I thought that Homegoing was very good indeed; it surpassed my expectations. The novel tracks two branches of a family, ranging in setting from the Gold Coast as the slave trade is beginning to present day US. Each chapter is narrated by a new character, each a generation later than the last. I worried that this might be frustrating and stop me bonding with the characters but, in general, they were well-drawn and interesting enough for this not be a problem ... It\u2019s a first novel by a young author, so it\u2019s not all perfect, but I thought it was an excellent read and recommend it. Staying with racism infecting society (it\u2019s been a cheerful reading fortnight), I then read The Nowhere Man by Kamala Markandaya \u2026 it\u2019s a really good novel and quite nuanced in its portrayal; for every racist, there are several other people in the community who are well-meaning, albeit sometimes in a clumsy way \u2026 Markandaya\u2019s prose can be a bit strange at times, causing the odd stumble in the first few pages. But, once you\u2019re into the rhythm of it, she\u2019s a very good writer. Feeling somewhat gloomy about humanity after those two reads, I then read The Summer Book by Tove Janssen (a whimsical, funny, enjoyable read) and Petersburg Tales by Nikolai Gogol (well-written, humorous and pleasingly satirical of the pettiness of human aspirations), which provided a good balance and rounded out my month nicely. Finally, A Single Thread by Tracy Chevalier has appealed to dihuet: Set in 1932, it focusses on the lot of Violet, a 38-year-old so-called \u2018surplus woman\u2019, in her situation of struggling to cope with loss, to make ends meet on a low-income job (afford a warm meal) and to be independent. We read about her position in her family and her developing new friendships, as Violet and others gradually and quietly push back against societal constraints. What is particular is that the author paints a detailed picture of ecclesiastical activities (the crafts of embroidery and bell-ringing) at Winchester Cathedral, where Violet finds some comfort in the community of volunteer broderers working on a project to embroider kneelers for worshippers. The scenes are well set and enjoyable; the characters come to life. The ending gave me food for thought. I won\u2019t say anymore. That seems like a good place for us to pause too. Interesting links about books and reading The deep and lasting resonance of Goodnight Moon. The JD Salinger exhibition at The New York Public Library sounds incredible. \u201cIsn\u2019t faux praise and elevation of mediocrity just as patronizing as the dismissal of \u2018ethnic writing\u2019?\u201d Colin Grant considers the anxieties and complexities of furthering diversity in the literary world. I \u201chad a good experience\u201d with Giovanni Boccaccio\u2019s Decameron says Anthony Madrid in The Paris Review. Reading Gaol is up for sale.

Michael Pollak, a barrister with the legal aid group Justice Abroad, which is spearheading a four-strong team defending the Briton, said it was evident she had post-traumatic stress disorder \u2013 brought on by her change of status from victim to suspect \u2013 and was susceptible to pressure. \u201cIt is the flight instinct of those who suffer from PTSD to want to take the easy way out and what is so unique here is that nothing was recorded by [Cypriot] police, creating the perfect environment for officers in the station to exert undue pressure on her to change evidence.\u201d He added: \u201cIt\u2019s quite clear police in Cyprus were under immense pressure to deal with the matter quickly, that no one wanted rape claims hovering over Ayia Napa, which after all depends on young tourists.\u201d Last week, police denied any mishandling of the case. \u201cWe have treated this affair with utmost sensitivity and seriousness,\u201d said the force\u2019s chief spokesman, Christos Andreou. Cyprus\u2019s economy is heavily reliant on tourism. The divided island\u2019s Greek-administered south is keen to expand already warm ties with Israel. The east Mediterranean nations are linked by security and energy ties that officials consider to be strategic and politically sensitive. Local NGOs echo the argument of the woman\u2019s defence lawyers that police mishandled the inquiry. \u201cFrom the outset she had no access to basic rights as foreseen under domestic and EU law,\u201d said Pavlou, adding that in a patriarchal society such as Cyprus the case had highlighted a lack of protocol by authorities in rape complaints. \u201cFor three days she had no mental health support. We have asked the attorney general to intervene because we want to put an end to her re-victimisation and this constant media exposure, which can only be traumatic. What we have seen has amounted to cannibalism. It is hugely troubling.\u201d The trial is set to last at least three days. If convicted, the Briton\u2019s defence team say they will take the case to the European court of human rights.",

      "body": "<p>My aunt Esther Hindley, who has died aged 95, was a nurse who worked before and after the inception of the NHS, of which she was a passionate advocate. She spent the whole of her career at the London hospital (now the Royal London), in the East End of the city, and would recall in great detail the bombing of the hospital during the second world war.</p> <p>Very protective of her NHS patients, she once got into trouble for complaining when the former prime minister Harold Macmillan was in the hospital recovering from surgery, as one of her night sisters was allocated to him alone, leaving only three between the remaining 600 patients.</p> <p>Born in Cambridge, Esther was the first child of Frances (nee Parker) and Eric Hindley. Her early years were spent on the edge of Rugby, Warwickshire, beside the Grand Union canal, where she developed a love of narrowboating. However, her father had a mental illness, and after he was admitted to hospital the family went to live with her grandparents in Cambridge.</p> <p>In the 1930s the family moved to St Albans, Hertfordshire, where her father, an Anglican priest, had obtained work. She spent her happiest childhood years there, with her younger brothers, John and Chris, and her red setter, Mickey.</p> <p>From 1935 she boarded at Brackley high school, Northamptonshire, after which she trained as a nurse at the London. As a student during the second world war she became familiar with the sound of the German V1 and V2 rocket bombs. Esther qualified in 1946 and started working at the London as a junior staff nurse on the surgical wards.</p> <p>By 1970 she had risen to the position of senior nursing officer. Five years later she was involved in organising the response to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/mar/01/dozens-killed-london-underground-crash-1975\" title=\"\">Moorgate tube train crash</a>, in which 43 people died.</p> <p>Esther combined her professional career with caring for her parents, in particular her father, who died in 1965. She retired from nursing at 59 following surgery for acoustic neuroma, which caused a loss of hearing in her left ear.</p> <p>Esther had a strong Christian faith. After her mother\u2019s death in 1983, she moved to Leatherhead, Surrey, where she volunteered to help people with dementia, at her local church, St Mary and St Nicholas, and at a night shelter. </p> <p>A Guardian reader, she engaged with the world throughout her life. She travelled extensively with her family and friends, to Europe, New Zealand and Canada, alongside her many narrowboat holidays in the UK.</p> <p>In 2016 Esther entered a care home near the Regent\u2019s canal in Islington, north London, where she was loved, respected and regarded as the honorary matron. </p> <p>Esther had the capacity to keep others in mind and for them to know it.

      "bodyText": "My aunt Esther Hindley, who has died aged 95, was a nurse who worked before and after the inception of the NHS, of which she was a passionate advocate. She spent the whole of her career at the London hospital (now the Royal London), in the East End of the city, and would recall in great detail the bombing of the hospital during the second world war. Very protective of her NHS patients, she once got into trouble for complaining when the former prime minister Harold Macmillan was in the hospital recovering from surgery, as one of her night sisters was allocated to him alone, leaving only three between the remaining 600 patients. Born in Cambridge, Esther was the first child of Frances (nee Parker) and Eric Hindley. Her early years were spent on the edge of Rugby, Warwickshire, beside the Grand Union canal, where she developed a love of narrowboating. However, her father had a mental illness, and after he was admitted to hospital the family went to live with her grandparents in Cambridge. In the 1930s the family moved to St Albans, Hertfordshire, where her father, an Anglican priest, had obtained work. She spent her happiest childhood years there, with her younger brothers, John and Chris, and her red setter, Mickey. From 1935 she boarded at Brackley high school, Northamptonshire, after which she trained as a nurse at the London. As a student during the second world war she became familiar with the sound of the German V1 and V2 rocket bombs. Esther qualified in 1946 and started working at the London as a junior staff nurse on the surgical wards. By 1970 she had risen to the position of senior nursing officer. Five years later she was involved in organising the response to the Moorgate tube train crash, in which 43 people died. Esther combined her professional career with caring for her parents, in particular her father, who died in 1965. She retired from nursing at 59 following surgery for acoustic neuroma, which caused a loss of hearing in her left ear. Esther had a strong Christian faith. After her mother\u2019s death in 1983, she moved to Leatherhead, Surrey, where she volunteered to help people with dementia, at her local church, St Mary and St Nicholas, and at a night shelter. A Guardian reader, she engaged with the world throughout her life. She travelled extensively with her family and friends, to Europe, New Zealand and Canada, alongside her many narrowboat holidays in the UK. In 2016 Esther entered a care home near the Regent\u2019s canal in Islington, north London, where she was loved, respected and regarded as the honorary matron. Esther had the capacity to keep others in mind and for them to know it. She knew where all her nephews and nieces, grandnephews and grandnieces and her great-grandniece were, and what they were doing. In turn we adored her. She is survived by us and by her brother John. Chris died in 2016.",

      "bodyText": "The UK cybersecurity firm Sophos, which assisted the NHS and a number of businesses during a massive WannaCry ransomware attack two years ago, is to be bought by a US private equity group for $3.9bn (\u00a33.1bn). The FTSE 250 company, which is based in Abingdon near Oxford and employs 3,400 people, said it would unanimously recommend the offer from Thoma Bravo. It is the first acquisition outside the US for the San Francisco-based buyout firm. Sophos shares jumped 37% to 585p, in line with the bid terms of $7.40p a share (583p). Sophos floated at 225p in June 2015, valuing the firm at just over \u00a31bn, in one of the biggest technology IPOs in the UK that year. It was its third attempt at going public. The company was founded in 1985 by Jan Hruska and Peter Lammer, who stepped down as joint chief executives in 2005, although they still act as special advisers to the board. They have committed to selling their stakes, a combined 16.3%, to Thoma Bravo and will make \u00a3216m and \u00a3248m respectively. The chief executive, Kris Hagerman, will make \u00a316m from selling his 0.57% stake, while Nick Bray, the outgoing chief financial officer, is in line for \u00a31.6m from his 0.06% holding. Sophos is the latest UK company to be taken over by an overseas firm taking advantage of the fall in the value of sterling since the Brexit vote in June 2016. Among other recent deals were Hasbro snapping up Peppa Pig owner Entertainment One for \u00a33.3bn and Hong Kong\u2019s richest person, Li Ka-shing, buying pubs group Greene King for \u00a32.7bn, both in August. \u201cAnother day, another takeover of a UK company by a foreign business,\u201d said Russ Mould, investment director at stockbroker AJ Bell. \u201cSterling weakness has made pound-denominated assets look cheap and so we\u2019ve seen many overseas firms pounce on UK assets in the past few years.\u201d Sophos makes software to protect organisations against cyberattacks and there has been strong demand for its products in recent years.

As well as the NHS, its 400,000 clients around the world include the animation studio Pixar, the carmaker Ford, the retailer Under Armour, the aerospace and defence firm Northrop Grumman and Japanese conglomerate Toshiba.

Syrian rebel groups loyal to Ankara launched an assault on the Kurdish-held city of Manbij with support from Turkish artillery and an air strike, a rebel commander told the Guardian. The militiamen \u2013 including many fighters who hailed from the city and fled years ago \u2013 clashed not only with Kurdish fighters but Syrian regime troops, fighting together for the first time since Sunday\u2019s deal.</p> \n<p>US troops were understood to still be on the ground in pockets of north-east Syria, including al-Saediya village, about 4 miles (7km) west of Manbij.

The final terms of the deal appeared to still be under discussion on Monday, with several contradictory reports of its contents emerging.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, Turkish fighters and their allies were continuing to attack Tel Abyad and Ras al-Ayn, two cities that have been the focus of Ankara\u2019s mission to push Kurdish fighters \u2013 whom it considers to be terrorists \u2013 away from its southern border and create a 20-mile buffer zone where it says it will resettle at least 1 million Syrian refugees.</p> \n<p>In a statement, the European Union said it unanimously condemned Turkey\u2019s offensive and asked all member states to stop selling arms to Ankara.</p> \n<p>Syria and Turkey have exchanged hostilities sporadically throughout the past nine years but their forces have never engaged in sustained combat, pulling back from doing so at key moments in earlier Turkish incursions into Syrian territory.</p> \n<p>The prospect of fighting between Syrian troops and Turkish soldiers and their allies raised deep concerns over the security of the estimated 11,000 Isis fighters and their families who are detained across the region. At least 750 people with links to the terrorist group <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/13/kurds-say-785-isis-affiliates-have-escaped-camp-after-turkish-shelling\">escaped from detention camps</a> in the area on Sunday.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"1c35effc-5275-45b1-802b-719ec45f0087\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2c1uGFT1VJc?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Syrian state media said on Monday that units from President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s army were moving north to \u201cconfront Turkish aggression on Syrian territory\u201d. </p> \n<p>\u201cAfter everything, it seems that the fate of the Kurdish people [is to be abandoned],\u201d Ismat Sheikh Hassan, the leader of the military council in Kobane, told local television. \u201cWe did everything that we could, we called upon the international community \u2026 but it did not result in a solution.

The women and children who were formerly part of the \u201ccaliphate\u201d had been held in a secure annexe at the Ain Issa camp. They began to riot and scared away the guards after Turkish shelling struck nearby, said Abdulkader Mwahed, the joint president for humanitarian affairs in the Kurdish-held area of Syria.</p> \n<p>The camp was home to about 13,000 people, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/13/three-orphans-found-in-isis-camp-under-turkish-attack-may-be-british\">three suspected British orphans</a> and a British recruiter for Isis, Tooba Gondal.</p> \n<p><em>Additional reporting by Hussein Akkosh</em></p>",

In a statement, the European Union said it unanimously condemned Turkey\u2019s offensive and asked all member states to stop selling arms to Ankara. Syria and Turkey have exchanged hostilities sporadically throughout the past nine years but their forces have never engaged in sustained combat, pulling back from doing so at key moments in earlier Turkish incursions into Syrian territory. The prospect of fighting between Syrian troops and Turkish soldiers and their allies raised deep concerns over the security of the estimated 11,000 Isis fighters and their families who are detained across the region. At least 750 people with links to the terrorist group escaped from detention camps in the area on Sunday. Syrian state media said on Monday that units from President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s army were moving north to \u201cconfront Turkish aggression on Syrian territory\u201d. \u201cAfter everything, it seems that the fate of the Kurdish people [is to be abandoned],\u201d Ismat Sheikh Hassan, the leader of the military council in Kobane, told local television. \u201cWe did everything that we could, we called upon the international community \u2026 but it did not result in a solution. We urged all Kurdish [groups] to show solidarity, but no one listened.\u201d The deal is likely to bring a bitter end to five years of semi-autonomy for Kurdish groups in north-east Syria. Turkey\u2019s Operation Peace Spring started on Wednesday after Donald Trump announced that US forces would withdraw from the region. Trump had not specified a timeframe for the US withdrawal from Syria, but on Sunday, the US defence secretary, Mark Esper, said the remaining 1,000 special forces had been ordered to leave \u201cas safely and quickly as possible\u201d as the fighting between Turkey and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) began to threaten US military positions. The SDF has been funded and trained by the US to combat Isis since 2015, finally defeating the militant group in March after losing 11,000 troops in the battle. Turkey, however, says the largest unit of of the SDF, the Kurdish YPG, is a terrorist group indistinguishable from the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 party (PKK), which has fought an insurgency against the Turkish state for decades. Trump\u2019s decision to abandon the SDF to an inevitable Turkish assault has been widely criticised, even by his staunchest allies, as a betrayal that has unleashed a humanitarian disaster and threatens to sow the seeds of an Isis resurgence amid the ensuing chaos. On Sunday, at least 750 people with suspected links to Isis reportedly fled a displacement camp in north-east Syria. The women and children who were formerly part of the \u201ccaliphate\u201d had been held in a secure annexe at the Ain Issa camp. They began to riot and scared away the guards after Turkish shelling struck nearby, said Abdulkader Mwahed, the joint president for humanitarian affairs in the Kurdish-held area of Syria. The camp was home to about 13,000 people, including three suspected British orphans and a British recruiter for Isis, Tooba Gondal. Additional reporting by Hussein Akkosh",

This is Japan\u2019s victory road!\u201d A translation of the description of Japan\u2019s second try from the official Rugby World Cup site was also carried in local media: \u201cThe hooker creates it and the prop finishes it \u2013 with three offloads in between. It\u2019s the sort of try only Japan can score \u2026\u201d Japan\u2019s move up to seventh in the world rankings, the national side\u2019s highest position, was also widely lauded. Domestic media coverage of the victory was also notable for its handling of the diverse nature of the current Japan team with the New Zealand-born captain Michael Leitch, who has played in Japan since high school, and their star winger Kotaro Matsushima, who was born in South Africa to a Japanese mother and Zimbabwean father. Analysis of previous World Cup tournaments featured discussions of the number of \u201cforeign players\u201d in the side, but still largely homogenous Japan has embraced this crop of players, with its \u201cOne Team\u201d slogan, as its own. Twitter users commented on the \u201ccute\u201d halting Japanese of the New Zealand-born Luke Thompson, veteran of four World Cup campaigns, in his post-match speeches. Newspaper special editions were rushed out in Tokyo on Sunday night after the game, as they were after the earlier pool victory against Ireland, though some papers refrained from distributing them in areas badly hit by the typhoon. The mood of self-restraint, what the Japanese call jishuku, was also evident on Monday morning television news and chat shows, which all led with extensive coverage of the ongoing rescue efforts and damage from the weekend storm before covering the rugby.",

But then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/jackie-brown\" title=\"\">Jackie Brown</a> (1997), adapted from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/aug/20/elmore-leonard\" title=\"\">Elmore Leonard</a>\u2019s novel Rum Punch, is not like other Tarantino movies. Rather than revelling in the offhand comic violence that made the director famous, this is a humane and tentative love story between two seen-it-all veterans of the last-chance saloon: Jackie, a money-smuggling flight attendant played by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/dec/11/pam-grier-quentin-tarantino-blaxploitation\" title=\"\">Pam Grier</a>, and the sanguine, by-the-book bailbondsman Max Cherry, in whom Forster shows the flame of hope still flickering.</p> <p>When Max first sees Jackie, a subtle shift in Forster\u2019s eyes signals that something inside this man, who has previously been impossible to sway or impress, has suddenly been reignited. That their connection is rooted in empathy and kinship long before it flowers into romance (they kiss just once in the film\u2019s closing minutes) makes it that bit more profound.</p> <p>Forster called it \u201cthe best job I ever had\u201d. His performance was informed by his own proximity to Max\u2019s circumstances: prior to being cast by Tarantino, he was no stranger to the last-chance saloon himself. He had enjoyed one spell of success three decades earlier when he made his screen debut as a disturbed and taciturn army private caught up in the psychodrama between his superior (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/jul/03/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries\" title=\"\">Marlon Brando</a>) and that man\u2019s promiscuous wife (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/mar/23/elizabeth-taylor-obituary\" title=\"\">Elizabeth Taylor</a>) in John Huston\u2019s Reflections in a Golden Eye (1967). Forster\u2019s wiry, insolent good looks and coiled stillness would always have set him apart, but it did not hurt that he was shown riding a horse naked, bareback in both senses of the word, as Brando and Taylor looked on admiringly.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2c29c7ffe83ecb4531b0c3538ff8802193b55fa2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2c29c7ffe83ecb4531b0c3538ff8802193b55fa2/0_152_4048_5058/800.jpg\" alt=\"Robert Forster with Elizabeth Taylor on the set of Reflections in a Golden Eye, 1967.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Robert Forster with Elizabeth Taylor on the set of Reflections in a Golden Eye, 1967.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He followed this with several years of impressive work, most notably the western The Stalking Moon (1968), alongside <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/jun/14/guardianobituaries.film\" title=\"\">Gregory Peck</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/dec/27/haskell-wexler\" title=\"\">Haskell Wexler</a>\u2019s Medium Cool (1969), an expert blend of drama and documentary that included scenes shot amid the protests and rioting at the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Forster played a cameraman who becomes politicised when his footage is used in the FBI\u2019s crackdown on anti-war protesters.</p> <p>His career nosedived soon after, and by the time Tarantino came calling (the pair had met initially when the actor auditioned unsuccessfully for Tarantino\u2019s 1992 debut, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/reservoir-dogs\" title=\"\">Reservoir Dogs</a>) it was in the doldrums. \u201cI have four kids,\u201d he later said. \u201cI took any job I could get.\u201d Jackie Brown rescued Forster from obscurity and brought him his only Oscar nomination. The director described casting him as \u201cone of the best choices I\u2019ve ever made in my life.\u201d</p> <p>The son of Grace (nee Montanerella) and Robert Foster, he was born and raised in Rochester, New York. His father trained elephants for circuses including Ringling Bros and Barnum and Bailey. His parents divorced when he was eight. The \u201cr\u201d was added to his surname later to distinguish himself from a namesake in Actors\u2019 Equity.</p> <p>He got a degree in psychology from the University of Rochester, where he had already decided in his sophomore year to become an actor. Following a beautiful young woman (who later became his first wife) into an audition, he had ended up being cast in the chorus. This derailed his previous plans to go on to study law. He spent time in New York City looking for theatre work, returning every few days to Rochester to earn enough money as a substitute teacher to fund another week or so in cheap digs in Manhattan.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"055db34ba26ace56eea03d6377ea3ccfc7978327\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/055db34ba26ace56eea03d6377ea3ccfc7978327/142_452_5630_3377/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Robert Forster and Sondra Locke in Cover Me Babe, 1970.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Robert Forster and Sondra Locke in Cover Me Babe, 1970.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Darryl F Zanuck saw him on Broadway in 1965 in Mrs Dally and was sufficiently impressed to put him under contract to 20th Century Fox. Soon after this, Forster told the New York Times in 1972, his mother killed herself by self-immolation when he received his draft notice to serve in Vietnam. He was eventually exempted from service, partly because of the psychological effects of her death.</p> <p>He starred with <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituaries-sir-dirk-bogarde-1092705.html\" title=\"\">Dirk Bogarde</a> and Anouk Aim\u00e9e in the ill-fated drama Justine (1969), which changed directors midway through production, then played an avant-garde film-maker in Cover Me Babe and a tormented priest in Pieces of Dreams (both 1970). Aside from the shoddy but charming The Black Hole (1979), a transparent attempt by Disney to cash in on the Star Wars craze, the rest of his pre-Tarantino years were dominated by exploitation fare.</p> <p>Alligator (1980) was an enjoyable comic horror, and Forster directed himself (his only time behind the camera) as a detective in Hollywood Harry (1986). A role in the Chuck Norris action vehicle The Delta Force (also 1986) announced a marked downturn. \u201cThere was a long time when I only did positive characters,\u201d he said. \u201cThen somewhere in the middle of my career I was broke and I did a bad guy in The Delta Force. And I got stuck in bad guys for 13 years.

When that was rejected by the network ABC, and reshaped with new footage into a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/mulholland-drive\" title=\"\">film</a>, the result, released in 2001, included Forster in only one scene. He featured more prominently in Lynch\u2019s acclaimed third series of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/series/twin-peaks--episode-by-episode\" title=\"\">Twin Peaks</a> (2017) as a sheriff who greets each outlandish turn of the plot with equanimity.

He followed this with several years of impressive work, most notably the western The Stalking Moon (1968), alongside Gregory Peck, and Haskell Wexler\u2019s Medium Cool (1969), an expert blend of drama and documentary that included scenes shot amid the protests and rioting at the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Forster played a cameraman who becomes politicised when his footage is used in the FBI\u2019s crackdown on anti-war protesters. His career nosedived soon after, and by the time Tarantino came calling (the pair had met initially when the actor auditioned unsuccessfully for Tarantino\u2019s 1992 debut, Reservoir Dogs) it was in the doldrums. \u201cI have four kids,\u201d he later said. \u201cI took any job I could get.\u201d Jackie Brown rescued Forster from obscurity and brought him his only Oscar nomination. The director described casting him as \u201cone of the best choices I\u2019ve ever made in my life.\u201d The son of Grace (nee Montanerella) and Robert Foster, he was born and raised in Rochester, New York. His father trained elephants for circuses including Ringling Bros and Barnum and Bailey. His parents divorced when he was eight. The \u201cr\u201d was added to his surname later to distinguish himself from a namesake in Actors\u2019 Equity. He got a degree in psychology from the University of Rochester, where he had already decided in his sophomore year to become an actor. Following a beautiful young woman (who later became his first wife) into an audition, he had ended up being cast in the chorus. This derailed his previous plans to go on to study law. He spent time in New York City looking for theatre work, returning every few days to Rochester to earn enough money as a substitute teacher to fund another week or so in cheap digs in Manhattan. Darryl F Zanuck saw him on Broadway in 1965 in Mrs Dally and was sufficiently impressed to put him under contract to 20th Century Fox. Soon after this, Forster told the New York Times in 1972, his mother killed herself by self-immolation when he received his draft notice to serve in Vietnam. He was eventually exempted from service, partly because of the psychological effects of her death. He starred with Dirk Bogarde and Anouk Aim\u00e9e in the ill-fated drama Justine (1969), which changed directors midway through production, then played an avant-garde film-maker in Cover Me Babe and a tormented priest in Pieces of Dreams (both 1970). Aside from the shoddy but charming The Black Hole (1979), a transparent attempt by Disney to cash in on the Star Wars craze, the rest of his pre-Tarantino years were dominated by exploitation fare. Alligator (1980) was an enjoyable comic horror, and Forster directed himself (his only time behind the camera) as a detective in Hollywood Harry (1986). A role in the Chuck Norris action vehicle The Delta Force (also 1986) announced a marked downturn. \u201cThere was a long time when I only did positive characters,\u201d he said. \u201cThen somewhere in the middle of my career I was broke and I did a bad guy in The Delta Force. And I got stuck in bad guys for 13 years. I didn\u2019t do a good guy again until Jackie Brown.\u201d His prospects picked up after his Oscar nomination. He was in the Jim Carrey slapstick comedy Me, Myself and Irene (2000) and The Descendants (2011) with George Clooney. Scheduling conflicts had prevented him from accepting a role in the original 1990 series of David Lynch\u2019s innovative television whodunit Twin Peaks but he was cast in 1999 in the pilot episode of Lynch\u2019s noir TV series, Mulholland Drive. When that was rejected by the network ABC, and reshaped with new footage into a film, the result, released in 2001, included Forster in only one scene. He featured more prominently in Lynch\u2019s acclaimed third series of Twin Peaks (2017) as a sheriff who greets each outlandish turn of the plot with equanimity. Lynch called him \u201ca great actor and a great human being\u201d. He was recently seen as a man whose wife is suffering from dementia in What They Had (2018), and in El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie (2019), a Netflix spin-off of the TV series Breaking Bad in which he had previously played \u201cthe Disappearer,\u201d a vacuum cleaner salesman moonlighting as a supplier of new identities. He is survived by his partner, Denise Grayson, as well as four children: a son, Robert Jr, from an early relationship, and three daughters, Elizabeth, Maeghen and Kate, from two marriages, both of which ended in divorce. \u2022 Robert Forster (Robert Wallace Foster Jr), actor, born 13 July 1941; died 11 October 2019",

There will be a nagging concern among England supporters that facing Australia will be a bit of a shock to the system for their side, having been on cruise control hitherto.

If those can be eradicated then Australia will be a force to be reckoned with.</p> <h2><strong>2)</strong> Tackle their strengths</h2> <p>It was at times like a scene from the Alamo in the second half but England should pay close attention to how Wales went about beating Australia. Wales took them on at an area of traditional strength, outgunning them at the breakdown despite the Wallabies fielding Michael Hooper and David Pocock. Wales won 11 turnovers to Australia\u2019s three and the back-row trio of Aaron Wainwright, Justin Tipuric and Josh Navidi \u2013 all flankers by trade \u2013 were outstanding throughout, consistently denying the Wallabies quick ball. By contrast, it was Pocock ruling the breakdown against Georgia, having been moved to openside and handed the captaincy. He is one player moving through the gears nicely for Australia and England will still have nightmares of how he and Hooper condemned them to an early World Cup exit four years ago. If England are to combat that threat, so much rests on Tom Curry and Sam Underhill. The \u2018\u201cKamikaze Kids\u201d are thick as thieves off the field and their burgeoning partnership on it looks promising.

His captain will play, but where is less certain with Jones denied the chance to give him a run at fly-half against France. Michael Cheika, however, has a bigger headache over his No 10 and indeed his scrum-half. Against Georgia he started with Nic White and Matt Toomua \u2013 who has perhaps looked the most accomplished at fly-half, carrying hard and straight \u2013 which was his 11th half-back pairing since the 2015 World Cup final. White seems to be the pragmatic choice at No 9 but at fly-half Chieka\u2019s other options include Bernard Foley, dreadfully out of nick, and Christian Leali\u2019ifano, who was the fly-half for the record win over the All Blacks in Perth in August. With James O\u2019Connor and Kurtley Beale at his disposal, Cheika has plenty of choices but he must get his selection right if Australia are to advance to the last four.</p> <h2><strong>4)</strong> Indiscipline has been a Wallaby problem</h2> <p>Another yellow card for Australia, this time for Isi Naisarani, taking their total for the tournament to three. And that does not take into account Reece Hodge\u2019s citing for his high tackle on Fiji\u2019s Peceli Yato. For all that Michael Cheika has raged about officiating at the World Cup, his side do not seem to be able to stay on the right side of the law. Contrast that to England, who have not received a card of any colour. Granted, they have played one less match, and it was determined afterwards that Piers Francis ought to have received a yellow card against the USA, but England\u2019s disciplinary record has been better so far. That could well mean that they are due one or that it is an area where they have the edge on Australia. Either way, Cheika must drum into his players that they must avoid contact with the head if things are to change for the Wallabies.</p> <h2><strong>5)</strong> The battle starts with Cheika</h2> <p>It did not take long for Cheika to pull the pin out of the first verbal grenade and lob it in the direction of his old rival Jones. Speaking soon after the victory over Georgia he said: \u201cI saw he was saying that that would be an advantage and the typhoon gods were smiling on him. So I suppose they\u2019d better win. They\u2019ve had the best preparation, according to the coach, so they\u2019d better go out there and win. We\u2019ll see how we go.\u201d Since being appointed as England head coach, Jones has led his side to six consecutive victories over Cheika\u2019s Wallabies, starting with a 3-0 series win in Australia in the summer of 2016. On that tour Jones came out on top in the verbal jousting as well and since then, the pair have rarely resisted the chance to go at it. It is unlikely they will change tack this week.</p>",

My first thought was climate crisis, innocent basking in the heat flipped to something cataclysmic \u2013 as everyone watching just stares into the distance.

It\u2019s ultra-disciplined and brimming with attitude and sisterhood. It\u2019s a Yas Queen from me. Elsewhere, there\u2019s a jumpstyle crew that comes over like Riverdance of the banlieues, and a giant silver pillow that inflates to fill the whole stage, absorbing and exuding naked bodies. But the stand-out, most resonant, work is Elsa Ch\u00eane\u2019s MUR/MER. The Brussels-based theatre director presents a beach scene with no beach. Towels laid out, bikinis, inflatables and sunscreen; a gradual gathering of people with their backs to us, facing a non-existent sea. And instead of the sun, just grey light, eerily slow movement freezing into tableau, and a creeping crescendo of white noise. The subversion of the sunny beach scene is fascinating and unsettling enough but as the wash of noise rises, the bodies lying on the floor take on a different guise. It feels like an apocalypse in the offing. Ch\u00eane\u2019s title suggests that blank backdrop is a wall, with the discarded bodies those shut out. My first thought was climate crisis, innocent basking in the heat flipped to something cataclysmic \u2013 as everyone watching just stares into the distance. Whatever you see, Ch\u00eane\u2019s simple imagery is potent.",

Belligerent meddling is now embedded in the west\u2019s world view. But just as there is rarely a good time to intervene in other people\u2019s troubles, so there is rarely a good time to stop. Were there a way in which a US army could swiftly bring peace and concord to northern Syria it might be different. There is none. Nothing in the modern history of the Middle East \u2013 not the Taliban or the Saddam or Assad regimes \u2013 has equalled the horror unleashed by the US\u2019s \u201cwars of 9/11\u201d. They have come to seem as interminable as they are unspeakable.</p> <p>As in any intervention, narratives evolve and alliances are formed. Most foolish was the encouragement and aid offered since 2015 to rebels in the Syrian civil war fighting against Bashar al-Assad \u2013 a war which David Cameron was inexplicably eager to have the UK join. As northern Iraq descended into chaos and the Kurds were emboldened to increase their pressure on Turkey, Syria became the venue for a nightmare three-way conflict. Throughout it, the US backed the Kurds.</p> <p>The two most recent presidents, Barack Obama and Trump, came to office firmly in favour of withdrawing from the region. But the US\u2019s military-industrial complex proved too powerful for them. Trump has been particularly emphatic about this, but his unpredictability and aggressive rhetoric has muddied his intentions. He has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/02/trump-to-blame-for-failure-of-us-iran-nuclear-talks-rouhani\" title=\"\">played hard and soft with Iran</a>, tried to leave Afghanistan but not dared to do so, and now leaves the Kurds in the lurch.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/13/trump-and-erdogan-risk-a-resurgent-isis-thanks-to-their-recklessness-in-syria\">Trump and Erdo\u011fan risk a resurgent Isis thanks to their recklessness in Syria | Hassan Hassan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When the outside world was united against Islamic State, a degree of strategic clarity was possible. Now Isis has, more or less, been bombed to pieces and older feuds have resurfaced. Trump has had enough. His <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/13/the-kurds-a-bitter-history-of-betrayal\" title=\"\">desertion of the Kurds</a> and his licence to Turkey to invade Syria must rank high in the annals of diplomatic treachery \u2013 but for realpolitik they are hard to fault.</p> <p>Thus go all interventions. In seeking to mimic the global policing role of Europe\u2019s 19th-century empires, American foreign policy has become an angel of disaster. Cities ancient and modern have been destroyed and religious faiths have been polarised and weaponised. Many people have died \u2013 possibly <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2018/country-chapters/syria\" title=\"\">hundreds of thousands</a> \u2013 and trillions of dollars have been wasted. It is as if the defeat of the Soviets in 1989 had cheated western armies of a third world war, leaving them determined to visit one on someone else \u2013 if not communism, then Islam. If Trump manages to end this self-defeating cycle, he deserves credit.</p> <p>\u2022 Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist</p>",

Belligerent meddling is now embedded in the west\u2019s world view. But just as there is rarely a good time to intervene in other people\u2019s troubles, so there is rarely a good time to stop. Were there a way in which a US army could swiftly bring peace and concord to northern Syria it might be different. There is none. Nothing in the modern history of the Middle East \u2013 not the Taliban or the Saddam or Assad regimes \u2013 has equalled the horror unleashed by the US\u2019s \u201cwars of 9/11\u201d. They have come to seem as interminable as they are unspeakable. As in any intervention, narratives evolve and alliances are formed. Most foolish was the encouragement and aid offered since 2015 to rebels in the Syrian civil war fighting against Bashar al-Assad \u2013 a war which David Cameron was inexplicably eager to have the UK join. As northern Iraq descended into chaos and the Kurds were emboldened to increase their pressure on Turkey, Syria became the venue for a nightmare three-way conflict. Throughout it, the US backed the Kurds. The two most recent presidents, Barack Obama and Trump, came to office firmly in favour of withdrawing from the region. But the US\u2019s military-industrial complex proved too powerful for them. Trump has been particularly emphatic about this, but his unpredictability and aggressive rhetoric has muddied his intentions. He has played hard and soft with Iran, tried to leave Afghanistan but not dared to do so, and now leaves the Kurds in the lurch. When the outside world was united against Islamic State, a degree of strategic clarity was possible. Now Isis has, more or less, been bombed to pieces and older feuds have resurfaced. Trump has had enough. His desertion of the Kurds and his licence to Turkey to invade Syria must rank high in the annals of diplomatic treachery \u2013 but for realpolitik they are hard to fault. Thus go all interventions. In seeking to mimic the global policing role of Europe\u2019s 19th-century empires, American foreign policy has become an angel of disaster. Cities ancient and modern have been destroyed and religious faiths have been polarised and weaponised. Many people have died \u2013 possibly hundreds of thousands \u2013 and trillions of dollars have been wasted. It is as if the defeat of the Soviets in 1989 had cheated western armies of a third world war, leaving them determined to visit one on someone else \u2013 if not communism, then Islam. If Trump manages to end this self-defeating cycle, he deserves credit. \u2022 Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist",

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s not the usual setting for a love story, but a chance meeting at HM Prison The Mount in Hertfordshire sparked romance for Helen and Steve. \u201cIt was 2006 and I was working as a teacher there,\u201d says Helen. Steve, who was a prison officer, had recently moved to the education department to expand his career. \u201cBack then nobody wanted to work in that area but I was keen to spend more time doing one-on-one work with prisoners. I was ready for something new.\u201d They met for the first time while Helen was teaching a class in the prison\u2019s library. \u201cAnd I always joke that he is long overdue to go back,\u201d says Helen. Although they both liked each other, Steve was reluctant to make the first move. \u201cI was a prison officer and she was a civilian, so I was worried it would have looked inappropriate.\u201d</p> <p>In September that year, Helen left the prison to start a new teaching job. On her last day, she wrote a note to Steve and originally gave it to a colleague to pass on. In the end she plucked up the courage to give him the letter directly, to let him know she was interested. \u201cI had an idea what it might be. It was either going to be her phone number or a note to say get lost, you\u2019ve got no chance,\u201d he says. The pair began dating the following month, pursuing their shared interests of art, opera and musicals. When they met, they had a few concerns about the 13-year age gap, although Helen says it has become much less significant over time. \u201cSteve was 29 when we started going out, and a few people raised eyebrows. It wasn\u2019t a big deal for us though. Age is just a number.\u201d</p> <p>While Steve admired Helen\u2019s intelligence and education, she was drawn in by his fun nature. \u201cI thought he had such a serious look about him, but underneath there is a very silly side. He just couldn\u2019t show it at work.\u201d At the time Helen was working as a teacher and a singer.</p> <p>They married in July 2008 during a silent Quaker meeting. \u201cThe vows, or promises as we call them, are spoken but the rest of the meeting takes place in silence,\u201d explains Helen. \u201cRather than having an officiant, we marry ourselves in front of witnesses at the meeting. Some people can then stand up afterwards and speak with messages for you.\u201d After the meeting the couple celebrated with a reception for friends and family.</p> <p>Not long after they were married, Helen\u2019s father became unwell. \u201cBetween 2008 and 2016 we lost three of our parents which was really hard,\u201d she says. They battled through bereavement together \u2013 Helen\u2019s parents and Steve\u2019s dad died in that time frame \u2013 and it brought them closer. Since then they have developed a passion for travel and visited many countries. \u201cWe have been all over the world, to Africa, Nepal, India, China, Australia and Brazil. I love that Steve is always up for anything and always enthusiastic. We do crazy things and change our plans at the last minute just because we can,\u201d says Helen. That \u201ccan do\u201d attitude is also something Steve loves about his wife. \u201cI remember once we went white-water rafting after a difficult six-hour trek. Helen was absolutely terrified, but she still got in the boat and did it. She never gives up. It\u2019s one of the things I most admire about her,\u201d he says.</p> <p>The couple attribute the success of their relationship to a close friendship and a taste for new adventures. \u201cI was an opera singer until I was 37, then a teacher and now I do some writing and composing. We are always reinventing ourselves and trying new things,\u201d says Helen. \u201cIt\u2019s so important to be able to do things together,\u201d says Steve. \u201cI think chemistry is superficial. When you really love someone you choose to invest that time in them.\u201d</p> <p>While the pair admit they have taken an unconventional path compared with other couples, they believe it has helped them to build a stronger bond. \u201cWe are never stagnant and we never say still,\u201d says Helen. \u201cWe have shared dreams and goals and I think that is really important for keeping a relationship alive.\u201d</p> <p><em>Want to share your story?

These people should think about the little children looking at their behaviour and saying \u201ccor\u201d to each other. My Race Is Human \u2018They\u2019re getting the Queen to announce a Tory manifesto\u2019 Once again the monarchy is allowing itself to be a political tool of Boris Johnson. This is becoming something of a habit. Much like the unlawful prorogation, on the surface it\u2019s not that odd to have a Queen\u2019s Speech. It is rather odd to have one right before a general election that the Tories have been campaigning for over the past month. They\u2019re getting the Queen to announce a Tory manifesto. pretentiouspenguin \u2018The hypocrisy is incredible\u2019 The Queen says the government is committed to the environment. There will be measures to improve air and water quality, and to promote the welfare of animals. The hypocrisy is incredible. This is the same govt thats being hauled through the courts by the people to ensure it abides by its own clean air act. mammonstool \u2018Doesn\u2019t it make you proud to see democracy in action?\u2019 Correct me if I am wrong, but today can be described as a rich great grandmother wearing costly jewels reading out in her plummy accent a list of various assorted right wing policies concocted by a \u201cgovernment\u201d that has yet to win a meaningful vote in parliament and one that has no majority. Doesn\u2019t it make you proud to see democracy in action? pipini \u2018The showiest most expensive party political broadcast\u2019\u2019 The showiest, most expensive party political broadcast ever. Paid for by taxpayers. On behalf of a party that is hopelessly divided. On behalf of a government that does not command a majority in parliament and has lost every one of six votes in a row. A Queen\u2019s speech that the government has no intention of implementing. Still, some of the flunkeys are wearing pretty frocks so it\u2019s all alright then. BroadfordBoy",

Unlike with fellow BBC series Inside No 9, this was not a conspiracy. So had Hornby pored over dozens of cryptics to find clues that reflected a marriage under strain? No, he recalls: it was serendipity. \u201cThose clues all appeared on the day I was writing that particular episode.\u201d Hornby is, it transpires, a devotee of this paper\u2019s puzzles. \u201cI love the Guardian crossword and have been a solver for many years \u2013 no other newspaper comes close.\u201d And what of Tom\u2019s horror at solving on a printed-out A4 sheet, rather than in the paper proper? This is, it seems, the product of experience. \u201cI don\u2019t like doing crosswords on screens or on PDF unless I have to \u2013 when I\u2019m travelling, for example.\u201d Arachne herself was tickled to be told by a pal \u2013 Supertramp\u2019s John Helliwell \u2013 that she had a cruciverbal cameo. \u201cIt\u2019s a gem of a series, as you\u2019d expect from Frears and Hornby,\u201d she says. \u201cWe tried to follow Lucy Mangan\u2019s advice and pace ourselves, but ended up bingeing the whole lot in one go,\u201d she says. And yes: as she told us was common in a Q&amp;A, she had no memory of composing the quoted clues. Finally, what next for Hornby and cryptics? \u201cOne day I would like to set a crossword, but I wasn\u2019t tempted to write the clues myself,'\u201d he says. \u201cIt would have taken me hours.\u201d Well, when the time comes, this is a puzzle I would like to see. For the writing and rewriting of clues, the author could, I have discovered, rely on the support of a stalwart setter \u2013 Arachne. More crosswords in fiction: The Moment Before Drowning, a crime novel by setter Picaroon. Fun, a graphic novel about crosswords. Cain\u2019s Jawbone, in which you have to work out the order of the pages. Alan Plater\u2019s Oliver\u2019s Travels. Crossword Ends in Violence (5), James Cary\u2019s D-day novel. Much of Morse.",

      "body": "<p>I went to Bologna in March to visit my friend Francesca and learn how to make tortellini \u2013 or rather, to begin to learn. We spent much of our time in her kitchen with her parents, hand-rolling dough, then folding small squares of it into triangles before closing them round our fingertips.</p> <p>The rest of the time was spent walking the city known as <em>la grassa</em> (opulent or fat) and <em>la dotta</em> (learned), tracing some of the 38 kilometres of red-brick porticoes that fringe the buildings. We also visited the university (considered the first in the world), which gives the city one of its nicknames, and Francesca a job in its library. Two medieval towers act as a reassuring central axis, pivotal points around which you move, pulling your eyes up. Then, just when you feel dizzy, shop windows steady you and pull your eyes down. They are filled with things that have earned the city its other nickname: cannon-sized mortadella and <em>salam</em><em>e rosa</em> sliced open to show off just how pink they are, along with great piles of wedges of parmesan cheese. Distracting windows also contain the things I had come to find: wooden trays containing hundreds of taut tortellini the size of a chickpea. There was also the performance of tortellini-making behind glass panes, which Francesca dismissed.</p> <p>My eyes were also tugged by sweets. Most often by a cake called <em>certosino</em>, a heavyweight, densely spiced cake covered with bling in the form of huge slices of glistening candied fruit. Bologna also has jam-filled <em>pinza</em>, flaky-topped chocolate cake the size of a small wheel, and <em>torta di riso</em>, a rice cake with a top the colour of winking creme caramel. Described to me as a sort of rice pudding cake with oomph and candied fruit, the Bolognese confection is also known as <em>torta degli addobbi</em>, which was traditionally made during the <em>festa degli addobbi</em>, a parish festival when people decorated addobbi (windows) with coloured material.</p> <p>Over time, torta di riso has become a celebration cake for Christmas, Easter, Sunday lunches and, in its simplest form, as an everyday treat.</p> <p>Traditionally, the cake tin is buttered and dusted with breadcrumbs, but it can be lined with parchment, too. Adding canditi is divisive: if you don\u2019t like it, don\u2019t do it.

      "bodyText": "I went to Bologna in March to visit my friend Francesca and learn how to make tortellini \u2013 or rather, to begin to learn. We spent much of our time in her kitchen with her parents, hand-rolling dough, then folding small squares of it into triangles before closing them round our fingertips. The rest of the time was spent walking the city known as la grassa (opulent or fat) and la dotta (learned), tracing some of the 38 kilometres of red-brick porticoes that fringe the buildings. We also visited the university (considered the first in the world), which gives the city one of its nicknames, and Francesca a job in its library. Two medieval towers act as a reassuring central axis, pivotal points around which you move, pulling your eyes up. Then, just when you feel dizzy, shop windows steady you and pull your eyes down. They are filled with things that have earned the city its other nickname: cannon-sized mortadella and salame rosa sliced open to show off just how pink they are, along with great piles of wedges of parmesan cheese. Distracting windows also contain the things I had come to find: wooden trays containing hundreds of taut tortellini the size of a chickpea. There was also the performance of tortellini-making behind glass panes, which Francesca dismissed. My eyes were also tugged by sweets. Most often by a cake called certosino, a heavyweight, densely spiced cake covered with bling in the form of huge slices of glistening candied fruit. Bologna also has jam-filled pinza, flaky-topped chocolate cake the size of a small wheel, and torta di riso, a rice cake with a top the colour of winking creme caramel. Described to me as a sort of rice pudding cake with oomph and candied fruit, the Bolognese confection is also known as torta degli addobbi, which was traditionally made during the festa degli addobbi, a parish festival when people decorated addobbi (windows) with coloured material. Over time, torta di riso has become a celebration cake for Christmas, Easter, Sunday lunches and, in its simplest form, as an everyday treat. Traditionally, the cake tin is buttered and dusted with breadcrumbs, but it can be lined with parchment, too. Adding canditi is divisive: if you don\u2019t like it, don\u2019t do it. Liqueur is also optional, although if you do add it, you should, as the Bolognese say, spruzzare abbondantemente (spray abundantly). Pour a glass on top of the still-warm cake.

      "body": "<p>The last time the All Blacks lost a World Cup match was in 2007. It was a match I do not have fond memories of, having played in it, but incredibly valuable lessons were learned considering New Zealand\u2019s record in the tournament since. Two things stand out when looking at why we <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/oct/08/rugbyunion.rugbyworldcup200714\" title=\"\">lost that match against France</a>. Firstly, we tinkered with our game plan throughout the pool stages and we just didn\u2019t quite get it right in the quarter-final. Secondly, we had not been tested at all in the pool stages and we came up against a team on a completely different level to anything we had experienced.</p> <p>The first point shows the danger of not having clarity but I am not sure the second is relevant at this World Cup. Back then we put 70-odd points on Italy, more than 100 on Portugal, we thrashed Scotland because they were fielding a weakened team and scored another 80 against Romania.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/oct/13/japan-typhoon-rugby-world-cup\">Japan show world their defiance and skill in face of typhoon destruction | Andy Bull</a> </p> </aside>  <p>You then get to the quarter-finals and the difference is huge. That is not the case any more. The lesser teams are competitive for long spells and while some scorelines have ended up as blow outs, things have improved so much in terms of athletic ability and physicality \u2013 all teams hit hard. All teams have strength and conditioning coaches, they have nutritionists and the benefits are being reaped.</p> <p>Having said that, there is inevitably a different feel when it becomes knockout rugby. Suddenly there is no tomorrow and all the players will all be aware of that. The key, and this is where the coaching staff come in, is to try and keep everything process driven as much as possible. When you start worrying about the outcome, that\u2019s when you have a problem. That was the big thing that changed for the All Blacks after 2007.</p> <p>You have to try and keep the mood and the atmosphere in the camp the same, or as similar as you can, whether it be a pool stage match against Portugal or a quarter-final against France. For New Zealand, it was the development of the players\u2019 leadership group after 2007 that has been key. How they learned to deal with the pressure and how they kept ice cold \u201cblue\u201d heads rather than panicked \u201cred\u201d heads in the crucial situations.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0665ce70c87cdc96c9de67326ff2703447365b4b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0665ce70c87cdc96c9de67326ff2703447365b4b/0_0_3000_2261/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chris Jack and Nick Evans following defeat to France in the 2007 World Cup.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"754\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chris Jack and Nick Evans following defeat to France in the 2007 World Cup.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ross Land/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It will be interesting to see how England deal with the transition. I do not believe that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/11/england-fallow-weekend-france-cancellation-rugby-world-cup\" title=\"\">cancelled match against France</a> will be much of a problem. Teams such as New Zealand and England can use that extra time to their benefit. Yes both teams have a couple of players who would have benefited from the extra game time, Mako Vunipola and Brodie Retallick for example, but both sets of players have been afforded a bit of downtime and then they can put in the extra analysis \u2013 everything will be that little bit more detailed.</p> <p>Where things could be problematic for England is the lack of experience of knockout international rugby. They did not get out of their pool four years ago which means there are only a few players in the squad with experience of playing a sudden-death World Cup match. Making up for that though, is the fact that the core of this team has huge experience of playing knockout club rugby. You look at the Saracens spine of this team and the amount of European matches they have won \u2013 Super Rugby does not have that kind of equivalent.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4138\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Breakdown\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly rugby union email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The biggest concern I have over England is their discipline and whether it stands up when the heat is on in the knockout stages. It is the only area where I worry about them and how a game could slip away from them. They play right on the edge, defensively they are right on that line and the one thing you do not want to do in a quarter or a semi-final is give teams easy outs. If England find themselves charging into rucks when there is no genuine chance of winning the ball, or if they find themselves going in at the side, it would not surprise me to see referees clamping down on that sort of thing the deeper we go into the tournament.</p> <p>With the pool stages now complete we are going to have very experienced assistant referees and that makes a difference \u2013 very little is going to go unnoticed. If England\u2019s opponents try and get under their skin, how will they react?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/14/ireland-australia-upset-odds-japan-rugby-world-cup-quarter-finals\">Rugby World Cup: how the quarter-finalists shape up | Michael Aylwin</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Because I fully expect that sort of challenge from Australia on Saturday. At the breakdown Australia will really try and put them under pressure, slow the ball down and try to take the sting out of England\u2019s power game. It will be niggly and how England\u2019s discipline holds up will be fascinating.</p> <p>To give them their dues, England have been clinical so far. They\u2019ve responded and adapted to what has happened to them. Teams want to lift their performances against England but Eddie Jones\u2019s players have found a way to get the result they needed. I think they are in a good place. The expectation will come from outside the group but I do expect an awkward, potentially scrappy game against Australia. The breakdown will be a massive contest and that could make it stop-start and help England in terms of their tactical kicking.</p> <p>Either way, it should be a cracking encounter and it will be proper knockout rugby. These are the matches that everyone has been waiting for and while we\u2019ve had a wonderful pool stage, bookended by New Zealand and South Africa going at it and then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/13/japan-scotland-rugby-world-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">Japan\u2019s incredible win over Scotland</a>, it is now that the World Cup really starts.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The last time the All Blacks lost a World Cup match was in 2007. It was a match I do not have fond memories of, having played in it, but incredibly valuable lessons were learned considering New Zealand\u2019s record in the tournament since. Two things stand out when looking at why we lost that match against France. Firstly, we tinkered with our game plan throughout the pool stages and we just didn\u2019t quite get it right in the quarter-final. Secondly, we had not been tested at all in the pool stages and we came up against a team on a completely different level to anything we had experienced. The first point shows the danger of not having clarity but I am not sure the second is relevant at this World Cup. Back then we put 70-odd points on Italy, more than 100 on Portugal, we thrashed Scotland because they were fielding a weakened team and scored another 80 against Romania. You then get to the quarter-finals and the difference is huge. That is not the case any more. The lesser teams are competitive for long spells and while some scorelines have ended up as blow outs, things have improved so much in terms of athletic ability and physicality \u2013 all teams hit hard. All teams have strength and conditioning coaches, they have nutritionists and the benefits are being reaped. Having said that, there is inevitably a different feel when it becomes knockout rugby. Suddenly there is no tomorrow and all the players will all be aware of that. The key, and this is where the coaching staff come in, is to try and keep everything process driven as much as possible. When you start worrying about the outcome, that\u2019s when you have a problem. That was the big thing that changed for the All Blacks after 2007. You have to try and keep the mood and the atmosphere in the camp the same, or as similar as you can, whether it be a pool stage match against Portugal or a quarter-final against France. For New Zealand, it was the development of the players\u2019 leadership group after 2007 that has been key. How they learned to deal with the pressure and how they kept ice cold \u201cblue\u201d heads rather than panicked \u201cred\u201d heads in the crucial situations. It will be interesting to see how England deal with the transition. I do not believe that the cancelled match against France will be much of a problem. Teams such as New Zealand and England can use that extra time to their benefit. Yes both teams have a couple of players who would have benefited from the extra game time, Mako Vunipola and Brodie Retallick for example, but both sets of players have been afforded a bit of downtime and then they can put in the extra analysis \u2013 everything will be that little bit more detailed. Where things could be problematic for England is the lack of experience of knockout international rugby. They did not get out of their pool four years ago which means there are only a few players in the squad with experience of playing a sudden-death World Cup match. Making up for that though, is the fact that the core of this team has huge experience of playing knockout club rugby. You look at the Saracens spine of this team and the amount of European matches they have won \u2013 Super Rugby does not have that kind of equivalent. The biggest concern I have over England is their discipline and whether it stands up when the heat is on in the knockout stages. It is the only area where I worry about them and how a game could slip away from them. They play right on the edge, defensively they are right on that line and the one thing you do not want to do in a quarter or a semi-final is give teams easy outs. If England find themselves charging into rucks when there is no genuine chance of winning the ball, or if they find themselves going in at the side, it would not surprise me to see referees clamping down on that sort of thing the deeper we go into the tournament. With the pool stages now complete we are going to have very experienced assistant referees and that makes a difference \u2013 very little is going to go unnoticed. If England\u2019s opponents try and get under their skin, how will they react? Because I fully expect that sort of challenge from Australia on Saturday. At the breakdown Australia will really try and put them under pressure, slow the ball down and try to take the sting out of England\u2019s power game. It will be niggly and how England\u2019s discipline holds up will be fascinating. To give them their dues, England have been clinical so far. They\u2019ve responded and adapted to what has happened to them. Teams want to lift their performances against England but Eddie Jones\u2019s players have found a way to get the result they needed. I think they are in a good place. The expectation will come from outside the group but I do expect an awkward, potentially scrappy game against Australia. The breakdown will be a massive contest and that could make it stop-start and help England in terms of their tactical kicking. Either way, it should be a cracking encounter and it will be proper knockout rugby. These are the matches that everyone has been waiting for and while we\u2019ve had a wonderful pool stage, bookended by New Zealand and South Africa going at it and then Japan\u2019s incredible win over Scotland, it is now that the World Cup really starts.",

The speed of the unravelling has been breathtaking.</p> <p>Trump has played down the Kurdish relationship as purely transactional. They had been given a lot of money and equipment, he pointed out. But it was not transactional for the soldiers who fought at each others\u2019s shoulders, and the civilians killed as a result of the Trump-Erdo\u011fan understanding.

      "bodyText": "In the week since Donald Trump\u2019s fateful phone conversation with Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, the US has entirely abandoned the Kurds, its most effective allies in the Middle East, and with them a Syria strategy that was five years in the making. The Islamic State flag has been raised once more and the last vestige of US credibility as a reliable partner lies crushed under Turkish tank tracks. It has arguably been the worst seven days for US foreign policy since the invasion of Iraq. Administration officials have been under orders to deny that Trump gave Erdo\u011fan a green light to invade north-eastern Syria, despite all the indications to the contrary. After the Turkish leader announced his intention to invade, Trump invited him to the White House, one of the most coveted rewards a US president can bestow. And even as his aides are instructed to lie on his behalf, Trump continues to flash a green light on Twitter, and not just to the Turks. While echoing Turkey\u2019s view of the Kurds as terrorists, Trump declared: \u201cOthers may want to come in and fight for one side or the other. Let them!\u201d Those \u201cothers\u201d include the Assad regime, and its Iranian and Russian backers, to whom the Kurds have appealed for their own salvation, as their US partners pack their bags and leave. A close, very personal and highly effective partnership between US (as well as British and French) advisers and Kurdish fighters in the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which took nearly five years to forge, has been totally undone in a few days. Since the US started dropping supplies to besieged Kurdish fighters in Kobane in late 2014, that partnership succeeded in rolling back Isis, rooting it out from one stronghold after another. At the same time, it held the regime at bay across a significant swath of Syria. These were Washington\u2019s limited objectives in Syria, inherited from the Obama administration. And they were achieved at very little cost to the US. The price was paid almost solely by the SDF, which lost 11,000 fighters. Regime forces are moving northwards into areas that were in the US sphere of influence just a few days ago, at the invitation of the SDF, desperate for assistance in the face of Turkey\u2019s murderous Syrian proxy militias. At the same time, Isis detainees are escaping from SDF detention facilities and the movement is reconstituting. The speed of the unravelling has been breathtaking. Trump has played down the Kurdish relationship as purely transactional. They had been given a lot of money and equipment, he pointed out. But it was not transactional for the soldiers who fought at each others\u2019s shoulders, and the civilians killed as a result of the Trump-Erdo\u011fan understanding. The US has let the Kurds down before, but Trump\u2019s sheer callousness has made it hard to imagine that this betrayal will be forgiven in the foreseeable future. The US military is also unlikely to forget being forced to cut and run, and watch a respected ally being crushed. There is considerable anger being reported from junior officers in the field and the generals back in the Pentagon. The next time US soldiers go looking for local partners to act as ground forces, it will be much harder. Who would fight with America now? After three years of Trump, that is an increasingly difficult question to answer. The president has lavished praise on adversaries such as Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un, while insulting allies in Europe and Asia who he has convinced himself are ripping off the American taxpayer. The flip side of the impeachment scandal is that while the US president was seeking to force his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to dig up dirt on Trump\u2019s political rival, he was paying no heed to the supposed priority of his own administration, to bolster Ukraine in the face of the Russian threat. That does not seem to have been a factor for him. There are even questions about Nato\u2019s survival if Trump wins re-election next year.

Until recently he was boxed in by a phalanx of his own officials with traditional Republican pro-Nato views. But the so-called \u201cadults in the room\u201d have dispersed one by one.

      "body": "<p>Hopes of a Brexit breakthrough surged after Leo Varadkar and Boris Johnson went for a walk in the Wirral and declared <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/10/boris-johnson-and-leo-varadkar-say-they-see-pathway-to-brexit-deal\">\u201ca pathway to a possible deal\u201d</a>. Four days later it is increasingly obvious that the pathway is steep and strewn with rocks.</p> <p>After a weekend of Brexit talks, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/13/barnier-warns-brexit-talks-have-been-difficult-amid-pessimism-over-deal\">Michel Barnier, gave EU diplomats a bleak account of progress</a> on Sunday night. At the heart of the problem is the same old Brexit conundrum: how can the UK quit the EU customs union and single market while maintaining an open border with Ireland to protect peace on the island.</p> <p>Last Thursday at Thornton Manor, Johnson made a major concession: he agreed there should be no customs border on the island of Ireland. That was the key to triggering the current round of intensified talks in Brussels. But dashing EU hopes, it is clear the UK is not seeking to return to a lightly retouched version of Barnier\u2019s original plan, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/10/brexit-eu-looks-to-northern-ireland-only-backstop-to-break-deadlock\">the Northern Ireland-only backstop</a>. Instead, the UK hopes to devise an unprecedented bespoke customs deal for Northern Ireland.</p> <p>While the British have not disclosed the plan, EU sources have outlined the main details. Northern Ireland would be legally part of the UK customs area, but practically in the EU customs union, following European rules on tariffs and quotas. It would be simultaneously in and out \u2013 a model quickly called Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s customs union, in mock homage to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/jun/03/feline-fine-fate-of-schrodingers-cat-can-be-reversed-study\">the physicist\u2019s theoretical cat that was simultaneously dead and alive</a>.</p> <p>Partly based on a cast-off Theresa May plan, it would allow Johnson to claim the whole of the UK has left the EU. Yet just as May discovered with her customs partnership, problems are plentiful. Brussels is worried about fraud and undermining EU customs rules. Business fears a bureaucratic nightmare. If a Northern Irish fizzy drinks company buys sugar from a non-EU country, what is the legal status of the sugar in the sugar-laden drinks destined for EU consumers? In talks on Monday and Tuesday, the EU are demanding answers to this sickly sweet problem.</p> <p>Barnier was unsparing about the risks for the EU, warning it could unravel the European customs code and poses a serious risk of fraud that could tarnish the single market. While the single market sounds abstract, at heart are concerns about consumer health and safety, and the reputation of European goods and produce. EU officials remember the BSE crisis as a vivid example of how a food scandal can destroy lives and farmers\u2019 reputations.</p> <p>With the customs problem unresolved, the two sides have made little progress on the other stumbling block, how to ensure greater democratic buy-in for Northern Ireland. In another significant concession, Johnson has dropped his insistence that the DUP should be able to veto the creation of an all-Ireland regulatory zone for goods \u2013 a key part of the jigsaw in avoiding a hard border. But the two sides have not agreed an alternative consent mechanism, with EU diplomats adamant there can be no unilateral right of exit.</p> <p>Johnson is rapidly discovering the Brexit constraints that May eventually knew so well: EU red lines, strong opposition in the House of Commons \u2013 and time.</p> <p>The EU will not take a risky gamble on an untested customs partnership to get a deal over the line on 31 October. If the prime minister wants to stick to his \u201cdo or die\u201d pledge, his best hope is a rebranded, retouched version of the EU\u2019s original Northern Ireland only backstop \u2013 rejected by May, as something no British prime minister could ever accept.</p> <p>Returning to the original backstop risks failing in the House of Commons. But so does Johnson\u2019s preferred \u201cdouble customs\u201d plan. The DUP appears to be toughening its opposition, a stance that might sway Conservative hardliners, although Jacob Rees-Mogg, a weather vane for Brexit hardliners, sounds emollient so far. On the other side of the house, many Labour MPs will oppose a Johnson deal that is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/13/boris-johnson-brexit-deal-theresa-may-trade\">forecast to hit the economy harder than May\u2019s plan</a>. At the start of a(nother) crucial week, the end of the Brexit path is still shrouded in fog.</p> <p><br></p>",

      "bodyText": "Hopes of a Brexit breakthrough surged after Leo Varadkar and Boris Johnson went for a walk in the Wirral and declared \u201ca pathway to a possible deal\u201d. Four days later it is increasingly obvious that the pathway is steep and strewn with rocks. After a weekend of Brexit talks, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, gave EU diplomats a bleak account of progress on Sunday night. At the heart of the problem is the same old Brexit conundrum: how can the UK quit the EU customs union and single market while maintaining an open border with Ireland to protect peace on the island. Last Thursday at Thornton Manor, Johnson made a major concession: he agreed there should be no customs border on the island of Ireland. That was the key to triggering the current round of intensified talks in Brussels. But dashing EU hopes, it is clear the UK is not seeking to return to a lightly retouched version of Barnier\u2019s original plan, the Northern Ireland-only backstop. Instead, the UK hopes to devise an unprecedented bespoke customs deal for Northern Ireland. While the British have not disclosed the plan, EU sources have outlined the main details. Northern Ireland would be legally part of the UK customs area, but practically in the EU customs union, following European rules on tariffs and quotas. It would be simultaneously in and out \u2013 a model quickly called Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s customs union, in mock homage to the physicist\u2019s theoretical cat that was simultaneously dead and alive. Partly based on a cast-off Theresa May plan, it would allow Johnson to claim the whole of the UK has left the EU. Yet just as May discovered with her customs partnership, problems are plentiful. Brussels is worried about fraud and undermining EU customs rules. Business fears a bureaucratic nightmare. If a Northern Irish fizzy drinks company buys sugar from a non-EU country, what is the legal status of the sugar in the sugar-laden drinks destined for EU consumers? In talks on Monday and Tuesday, the EU are demanding answers to this sickly sweet problem. Barnier was unsparing about the risks for the EU, warning it could unravel the European customs code and poses a serious risk of fraud that could tarnish the single market. While the single market sounds abstract, at heart are concerns about consumer health and safety, and the reputation of European goods and produce. EU officials remember the BSE crisis as a vivid example of how a food scandal can destroy lives and farmers\u2019 reputations. With the customs problem unresolved, the two sides have made little progress on the other stumbling block, how to ensure greater democratic buy-in for Northern Ireland. In another significant concession, Johnson has dropped his insistence that the DUP should be able to veto the creation of an all-Ireland regulatory zone for goods \u2013 a key part of the jigsaw in avoiding a hard border. But the two sides have not agreed an alternative consent mechanism, with EU diplomats adamant there can be no unilateral right of exit. Johnson is rapidly discovering the Brexit constraints that May eventually knew so well: EU red lines, strong opposition in the House of Commons \u2013 and time. The EU will not take a risky gamble on an untested customs partnership to get a deal over the line on 31 October. If the prime minister wants to stick to his \u201cdo or die\u201d pledge, his best hope is a rebranded, retouched version of the EU\u2019s original Northern Ireland only backstop \u2013 rejected by May, as something no British prime minister could ever accept. Returning to the original backstop risks failing in the House of Commons. But so does Johnson\u2019s preferred \u201cdouble customs\u201d plan. The DUP appears to be toughening its opposition, a stance that might sway Conservative hardliners, although Jacob Rees-Mogg, a weather vane for Brexit hardliners, sounds emollient so far. On the other side of the house, many Labour MPs will oppose a Johnson deal that is forecast to hit the economy harder than May\u2019s plan. At the start of a(nother) crucial week, the end of the Brexit path is still shrouded in fog.",

This is hardly surprising, given growing awareness of Libra\u2019s potential adverse consequences. If it offers anonymity to its users, Libra will become a platform for tax evasion, money laundering and terrorist finance. If, on the other hand, its privacy protections are lax, Libra will give Facebook access to users\u2019 most intimate financial details. Then there are the dangers Libra poses to economic and financial stability. Although Facebook\u2019s stablecoin will be backed by a portfolio of \u201clow-volatility assets\u201d, anyone who lived through the 2008 global financial crisis will know that low volatility is more a state of mind than an intrinsic attribute of an asset. If the prices of the bonds in the reserve portfolio fall in response to an unexpected rise in interest rates, for example, those bonds may then be inadequate to redeem all the Libra in circulation. At this point, the reserve will be subject to the equivalent of a bank run. And because Libra operates like a currency board, there will be no lender of last resort. Libra may also undercut the stabilising capacity of monetary and regulatory policies. If the residents of a country shift out of its national currency, the central bank\u2019s interest-rate-setting policies will be vitiated. To appreciate the consequences, one need look no further than Argentina\u2019s long, unhappy history of financial dollarisation. Finally, governments that use controls to regulate capital flows will find that they are more easily evaded. Their economies will be fully exposed to the foibles of global financial markets. This will be \u201cdisruption\u201d with a vengeance. Libra\u2019s rollout will require the approval of regulators.

Is it just hype? And is it all Elon Musk's fault?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>There is no conventional \u201cnarrative\u201d to Fortnite Battle Royale \u2013 Epic doesn\u2019t provide an origin story for its endless 100-player wars, it doesn\u2019t give us long cinematic scenes with characters explaining the world, the factions and the plot. Instead, Fortnite is split into a series of three-month-long seasons, each with a climactic event that suggests some kind of interdimensional struggle taking place over the future of the game\u2019s isolated island locale.</p> \n<p>The plot began in Season Three when players noticed space rocks hitting the surface of the island as they played. Season Four opened with a huge meteor crash, which destroyed the Dusty Depot area of the map, and then at the close of the season, a <a href=\"https://youtu.be/ZFB7k586Jm4\">rocket flew out of the impact site</a> in a live, in-game event visible to all players online at the time \u2013 an incredible technical achievement, and a fascinating new way to tell stories within a non-persistent multiplayer universe.</p> \n<p>From here, each season brought some new anomaly to the world, including giant alien cubes and vast volcanoes, all seemingly part of a fissure in space-time. But players were never told exactly what was going on \u2013 everything played out through dramatic season events, and clever little environmental storytelling features, such as in-game television screens suddenly showing countdowns, and new scenic features such as impenetrable bunkers appearing in the woods, with no explanation.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcALNEjs2KA\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dcALNEjs2KA?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcALNEjs2KA\">Watch a gamer react to the extraordinary finale</a>\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Through this system of events and signs, a kind of narrative economy emerged between players. Fans took to Reddit forums in their millions to discuss findings and theorise over what the latest signals could mean. These theories were focused and amplified by the game\u2019s biggest YouTube players \u2013 especially Fortnite superstar <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAW-NpUFkMyCNrvRSSGIvDQ\">Ninja</a> \u2013 who made videos, picking through clues they and other players had found in the landscape.</p> \n<p>Environmental storytelling has always been a key element of video game design. When you have a world that players are free to explore, it makes sense to fill that world with story-enhancing elements, rewarding players for having a good look round. Hidden audiotapes, emails and scrolls are a familiar element of action adventure titles such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/assassin-s-creed\">Assassin\u2019s Creed</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/mar/23/mass-effect-andromeda-game-review-galaxy-problems\">Mass Effect</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/grand-theft-auto\">Grand Theft Auto</a>. But these are grand, single-player experiences, where narrative discovery is a key element.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"12da897b-2587-4cf0-a974-48466c48a579\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>What is Fortnite: Battle Royale</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>In short, it's a mass online brawl where 100 players leap out of a flying bus on to a small island and then fight until only one is left. Hidden around are weapons and traps, and players must arm themselves while exploring.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>When was it released?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Fortnite started in July 2017 as a four-player cooperative survival game, but the game's developer, Epic, noticed the huge success of PC title PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG), which pits 100 players against each other, and decided to release a new version.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How much does it cost?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The game is free and players are able to unlock new items as they progress without paying anything. A Premium Battle Pass gives access to exclusive clothing and items.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Why is it so popular with kids?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>It's free, it's fun, and it has a very silly, offbeat sense of humour. While PUBG has a serious, realistic visual style, Fortnite: Battle Royale has very bright, almost cartoon-like graphics, as well as loads of ridiculous items and costumes, such as space suits and dinosaur outfits. Players can pull a variety of dance moves, and team up with a friend to compete as a duo or a squad. Participants can chat as they play using headsets and microphones.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is there violence? And is it addictive?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Although Fortnite is a multiplayer shooter, it does not depict bloody violence. It takes lots of enjoyable gameplay concepts from more mature shooting games but places them in a non-threatening, non-realistic world. In terms of addictiveness, Fortnite contains nothing that makes it different from other action video games. It's more that the game contains many different elements \u2013 nice visuals, good shooting mechanics, an interesting building component and lots of support and interest from YouTubers \u2013 into one package that is free to download.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Fortnite Battle Royale, on the other hand, is a multiplayer online game where players interact with the world in discrete 20-minute sessions. Ostensibly, there\u2019s no need for a narrative \u2013 Epic could, in theory, retain player interest simply by making sure there is a steady supply of new dance moves, costumes and scenic features to enjoy. Instead, the studio has built a vast functional universe in which an alien known as The Visitor is attempting to mend the space-time fissure around the island, and communicated this through systems of signs, signals and miracles \u2013 sort of like the Medieval Christian church. Indeed, it\u2019s interesting how Fortnite has co-opted a lot of religious symbolism into the game\u2019s suggestive narrative, from comets trailing across the sky, to the decidedly apocalyptic imagery of fire, brimstone and global destruction.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"162be027f5ca4ce9a8f4f7d47f93b457468e3152\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/162be027f5ca4ce9a8f4f7d47f93b457468e3152/0_105_2560_1264/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Beginning of the end \u2026 a rocket bursts from the earth.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"494\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Beginning of the end \u2026 a rocket bursts from the earth.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: YouTube/Epic Games</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>For Season 10, Epic was always building toward something vast and catastrophic and upped the narrative signalling accordingly. Throughout the last months players have been able to find audiotapes hidden around the map in which The Visitor has made recordings about his attempts to fix a loop in time and prevent a singularity. It sounds like the ravings of a conspiracy theorist, echoing back the most extreme theories from the fanbase itself.</p> \n<p>And then in the game\u2019s final moments on Sunday evening, a giant explosion took place, sucking the world into a black vortex, leaving players stunned and confused. Brilliantly, Epic took the explosion out of the \u201cfiction\u201d of the game, so that the menu pages and user interface were also pulled into the black hole. To complete the meta-narrative, players who looked up the game\u2019s server status found the narrative had even extended here:</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/HelenAngel/status/1183574048745246721\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Mad props to everyone on the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FortniteGame?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@FortniteGame</a> team for the brilliant execution of this season\u2019s end.

But as a purveyor of new forms of storytelling, in which the community is left to construct its own narrative based around subtle semiotic systems and climactic events, it is a fascinating innovator.</p> \n<p>In many ways, video-game storytelling is still young. The artform is barely 40 years old as a mass medium \u2013 compare that to the movie business (taking <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/23/rediscovering-lumiere-brothers-early-cinema-pioneers\">the Lumi\u00e8re brothers</a>\u2019 Cin\u00e9matographe as our start point), which was only just getting into era of colour after four decades. We have seen the rise of massively multiplayer adventures such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/world-of-warcraft\">World of Warcraft</a>, where global arching narratives are woven into the largely player-directed quests, and we have seen plenty of interesting live story experiments, such as the mostly single-player adventure <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/jun/01/dark-souls-remastered-review-dark-fantasy-rpg-makes-glorious-return\">Dark Souls</a> allowing players to leave messages to each other within the game.</p> \n<p>But Fortnite is playing with storytelling concepts, tropes and systems while also providing a piece of blockbuster entertainment for millions of mostly teenage players. It\u2019s like a new Marvel superhero movie being performed entirely in interpretive dance.</p> \n<p>When Chapter 2 inevitably begins, bringing a new landscape with new gameplay features, it will be interesting to see where Epic goes next on its somewhat transgressive storytelling odyssey. It is, after all, quite hard to top the end of the world as a narrative device.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7d7bd3ad91e9b74d5b943113b65d7fc4fb394561\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7d7bd3ad91e9b74d5b943113b65d7fc4fb394561/132_0_2073_1244/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Implosion \u2026 players and objects are sucked in before the creation of a black hole.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Implosion \u2026 players and objects are sucked in before the creation of a black hole.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: YouTube/Epic Games</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure>",

From here, each season brought some new anomaly to the world, including giant alien cubes and vast volcanoes, all seemingly part of a fissure in space-time. But players were never told exactly what was going on \u2013 everything played out through dramatic season events, and clever little environmental storytelling features, such as in-game television screens suddenly showing countdowns, and new scenic features such as impenetrable bunkers appearing in the woods, with no explanation. Through this system of events and signs, a kind of narrative economy emerged between players. Fans took to Reddit forums in their millions to discuss findings and theorise over what the latest signals could mean. These theories were focused and amplified by the game\u2019s biggest YouTube players \u2013 especially Fortnite superstar Ninja \u2013 who made videos, picking through clues they and other players had found in the landscape. Environmental storytelling has always been a key element of video game design. When you have a world that players are free to explore, it makes sense to fill that world with story-enhancing elements, rewarding players for having a good look round. Hidden audiotapes, emails and scrolls are a familiar element of action adventure titles such as Assassin\u2019s Creed, Mass Effect and Grand Theft Auto. But these are grand, single-player experiences, where narrative discovery is a key element. Fortnite Battle Royale, on the other hand, is a multiplayer online game where players interact with the world in discrete 20-minute sessions. Ostensibly, there\u2019s no need for a narrative \u2013 Epic could, in theory, retain player interest simply by making sure there is a steady supply of new dance moves, costumes and scenic features to enjoy. Instead, the studio has built a vast functional universe in which an alien known as The Visitor is attempting to mend the space-time fissure around the island, and communicated this through systems of signs, signals and miracles \u2013 sort of like the Medieval Christian church. Indeed, it\u2019s interesting how Fortnite has co-opted a lot of religious symbolism into the game\u2019s suggestive narrative, from comets trailing across the sky, to the decidedly apocalyptic imagery of fire, brimstone and global destruction. For Season 10, Epic was always building toward something vast and catastrophic and upped the narrative signalling accordingly. Throughout the last months players have been able to find audiotapes hidden around the map in which The Visitor has made recordings about his attempts to fix a loop in time and prevent a singularity. It sounds like the ravings of a conspiracy theorist, echoing back the most extreme theories from the fanbase itself. And then in the game\u2019s final moments on Sunday evening, a giant explosion took place, sucking the world into a black vortex, leaving players stunned and confused. Brilliantly, Epic took the explosion out of the \u201cfiction\u201d of the game, so that the menu pages and user interface were also pulled into the black hole. To complete the meta-narrative, players who looked up the game\u2019s server status found the narrative had even extended here: Fortnite has been criticised as a shallow, cynical machine of compulsion, its trendy dances and outlandish outfits a means of ensnaring younger players. But as a purveyor of new forms of storytelling, in which the community is left to construct its own narrative based around subtle semiotic systems and climactic events, it is a fascinating innovator. In many ways, video-game storytelling is still young. The artform is barely 40 years old as a mass medium \u2013 compare that to the movie business (taking the Lumi\u00e8re brothers\u2019 Cin\u00e9matographe as our start point), which was only just getting into era of colour after four decades. We have seen the rise of massively multiplayer adventures such as World of Warcraft, where global arching narratives are woven into the largely player-directed quests, and we have seen plenty of interesting live story experiments, such as the mostly single-player adventure Dark Souls allowing players to leave messages to each other within the game. But Fortnite is playing with storytelling concepts, tropes and systems while also providing a piece of blockbuster entertainment for millions of mostly teenage players. It\u2019s like a new Marvel superhero movie being performed entirely in interpretive dance. When Chapter 2 inevitably begins, bringing a new landscape with new gameplay features, it will be interesting to see where Epic goes next on its somewhat transgressive storytelling odyssey. It is, after all, quite hard to top the end of the world as a narrative device.",

      "body": "<p>Maryam* had always wanted to adopt a child. \u201cI used to watch a sitcom called Punky Brewster about a child who was adopted and I loved it to bits,\u201d she says. So when she and her husband Samir* found they had fertility issues, they decided not to pursue treatment and to adopt a child instead.</p> <p>But there was another big factor in their decision: faith. Maryam and Samir are practising Muslims. \u201cThe whole ethos of Islamic scripture talks about protecting and looking after the orphan child, the vulnerable child,\u201d says Maryam. \u201cThat, for us, was our direction. There were children who needed homes, and we needed a family. It didn\u2019t matter to us whether our family was biological or not.\u201d</p> <p>Author, theologian, social entrepreneur and speaker Dr Krish Kandiah is the founder of Home for Good, a charity working to inspire, equip and resource people to play their part in caring for vulnerable children. It\u2019s Christian in ethos but Kandiah stresses that you don\u2019t have to be a Christian to give them a call. He\u2019s also the father of seven children \u2013 four adopted and three birth children.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I became a Christian, I realised that even though I\u2019d messed up a bunch of stuff in my life, God was willing to take me as I was,\u201d he says. \u201cHe didn\u2019t care about the past. And that experience of welcome, grace and hospitality was such an important foundation in my life. What would it mean for a child who isn\u2019t able to live with their family and doesn\u2019t know a sense of security and belonging?\u201d</p> <p>And if you\u2019re a member of a faith community, you\u2019re in a perfect position to give a child from a similar faith and cultural background a home, says Hanif Dudhwala, secretary of the Muslim Welfare Institute (MWI). It runs a local project in Blackburn, Lancashire, aimed at raising awareness about adoption in Muslim communities, encouraging Muslims to consider adoption, and helping them through the adoption process and beyond.</p> <p>\u201cIf the child is Muslim, then the best place is a Muslim household,\u201d says Dudhwala. \u201cThe child will get the opportunity to learn about their religion and understand its teachings. It makes life a lot easier as these children grow up, in terms of faith, language and identity.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4587ba7afc3e5f623dc9d3edd4dee18ada12b7e8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4587ba7afc3e5f623dc9d3edd4dee18ada12b7e8/0_98_2500_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alice and her husband Paul\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alice and Paul felt that they had a duty as Christians to look after children in the care system.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Waugh/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Adopting when you have a faith can have its challenges. Maryam and Samir knew that some sections of the Muslim community felt that adoption was haram: forbidden. They explored the reasons for this belief, and discovered it had its roots in particular verses of the Qur\u2019an and an incident in the prophet\u2019s life when a distinction was made between a biological child and your adopted child.</p> <p>\u201cWe looked at the text, and to us it was clear it was about protecting the child\u2019s biological lineage and heritage,\u201d says Maryam. \u201cThe child needs to know they have a family beyond their adoptive family. And that is completely in line with the British norms and framework for adoption. There is so much emphasis on talking to the child about their birth mother and father, and their background.\u201d Scholars who specialise in theological differences in adoption attend every MWI event, and are happy to discuss these questions, says Dudhwala.</p> <p>Of course, being of a particular faith doesn\u2019t mean you can only adopt children from that faith and many children being adopted will come from a family where no faith was observed. Alice and Paul recently adopted a child with Down\u2019s syndrome as a direct result of Home for Good\u2019s outreach and awareness work. They will raise their child within their own faith, like any other parent. When they experienced fertility issues, the couple found that they weren\u2019t eligible for any NHS fertility investigations or treatment.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/you-can-adopt/2019/oct/14/olympian-tessa-sanderson-on-why-she-adopted-and-the-need-for-more-bame-adoptive-parents\">Olympian Tessa Sanderson on why she adopted \u2013 and the need for more BAME adoptive parents</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When Alice suggested that they adopt a child, Paul was initially unsure. \u201cBeing Christians \u2013 we\u2019re both ministers in the Salvation Army \u2013 we decided to wait a while and pray about it,\u201d says Alice. \u201cI read Krish Kandiah\u2019s book Home for Good and one day in the car, me and Paul listened to one of his sermons. Krish was saying the Bible makes it clear that as Christians we have a responsibility to look after children in the care system, and if we have the capacity to do that, why aren\u2019t we?

      "bodyText": "Maryam* had always wanted to adopt a child. \u201cI used to watch a sitcom called Punky Brewster about a child who was adopted and I loved it to bits,\u201d she says. So when she and her husband Samir* found they had fertility issues, they decided not to pursue treatment and to adopt a child instead. But there was another big factor in their decision: faith. Maryam and Samir are practising Muslims. \u201cThe whole ethos of Islamic scripture talks about protecting and looking after the orphan child, the vulnerable child,\u201d says Maryam. \u201cThat, for us, was our direction. There were children who needed homes, and we needed a family. It didn\u2019t matter to us whether our family was biological or not.\u201d Author, theologian, social entrepreneur and speaker Dr Krish Kandiah is the founder of Home for Good, a charity working to inspire, equip and resource people to play their part in caring for vulnerable children. It\u2019s Christian in ethos but Kandiah stresses that you don\u2019t have to be a Christian to give them a call. He\u2019s also the father of seven children \u2013 four adopted and three birth children. \u201cWhen I became a Christian, I realised that even though I\u2019d messed up a bunch of stuff in my life, God was willing to take me as I was,\u201d he says. \u201cHe didn\u2019t care about the past. And that experience of welcome, grace and hospitality was such an important foundation in my life. What would it mean for a child who isn\u2019t able to live with their family and doesn\u2019t know a sense of security and belonging?\u201d And if you\u2019re a member of a faith community, you\u2019re in a perfect position to give a child from a similar faith and cultural background a home, says Hanif Dudhwala, secretary of the Muslim Welfare Institute (MWI). It runs a local project in Blackburn, Lancashire, aimed at raising awareness about adoption in Muslim communities, encouraging Muslims to consider adoption, and helping them through the adoption process and beyond. \u201cIf the child is Muslim, then the best place is a Muslim household,\u201d says Dudhwala. \u201cThe child will get the opportunity to learn about their religion and understand its teachings. It makes life a lot easier as these children grow up, in terms of faith, language and identity.\u201d Adopting when you have a faith can have its challenges. Maryam and Samir knew that some sections of the Muslim community felt that adoption was haram: forbidden. They explored the reasons for this belief, and discovered it had its roots in particular verses of the Qur\u2019an and an incident in the prophet\u2019s life when a distinction was made between a biological child and your adopted child. \u201cWe looked at the text, and to us it was clear it was about protecting the child\u2019s biological lineage and heritage,\u201d says Maryam. \u201cThe child needs to know they have a family beyond their adoptive family. And that is completely in line with the British norms and framework for adoption. There is so much emphasis on talking to the child about their birth mother and father, and their background.\u201d Scholars who specialise in theological differences in adoption attend every MWI event, and are happy to discuss these questions, says Dudhwala. Of course, being of a particular faith doesn\u2019t mean you can only adopt children from that faith and many children being adopted will come from a family where no faith was observed. Alice and Paul recently adopted a child with Down\u2019s syndrome as a direct result of Home for Good\u2019s outreach and awareness work. They will raise their child within their own faith, like any other parent. When they experienced fertility issues, the couple found that they weren\u2019t eligible for any NHS fertility investigations or treatment. When Alice suggested that they adopt a child, Paul was initially unsure. \u201cBeing Christians \u2013 we\u2019re both ministers in the Salvation Army \u2013 we decided to wait a while and pray about it,\u201d says Alice. \u201cI read Krish Kandiah\u2019s book Home for Good and one day in the car, me and Paul listened to one of his sermons. Krish was saying the Bible makes it clear that as Christians we have a responsibility to look after children in the care system, and if we have the capacity to do that, why aren\u2019t we? When it finished, Paul said: \u2018Well, after that, I have no good reason for us not to do it.\u2019 And it has been the most wonderful experience.\u201d Even with the support of a faith community, adoption is challenging. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t rose-tint it,\u201d emphasises Kandiah. \u201cAround 70% of children in the care system will have experienced some kind of trauma. Dealing with that can be lifelong, and we need to be honest about that. \u201cIf you have the space in your house, if you have the space in your heart, there is nothing more rewarding. You can shape and change not just the life of one person, but a whole generation.\u201d *Not real names If you are interested in finding out more about adoption, contact First4Adoption on 0300 222 0022 or visit first4adoption.org.uk/youcanadopt",

      "body": "<p>So many identities, so little time! There\u2019s a lot of breathless trying on in Zadie Smith\u2019s first collection of short stories \u2013 as if she\u2019s late to a fancy dress party but still can\u2019t decide what costume to wear. Or whether to go in fancy dress at all. Or maybe go to the cinema instead? There is autofiction here, along with formal experimentation, dystopian sci-fi, surrealism, social satire, parable and a story from the point of view of God that reads like a droll reflection on creative restlessness.</p> <p>\u201cTo me, it was beautiful to move between these parallel projects, never getting bogged down, not feeling defined by one way of doing things, feeling light, feeling free\u2026 Doesn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t avoidant behaviour,\u201d says the omnipotent creator in Blocked.</p> <p>Each of Smith\u2019s five novels, from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/jan/26/fiction.zadiesmith\" title=\"\"><em>White Teeth</em> (2000)</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/nov/13/swing-time-zadie-smith-review\" title=\"\"><em>Swing Time </em>(2016)</a>, have danced from one identity to the next, shifting accent, cadence, tone. Meanwhile, her protean essay collections, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/nov/15/changing-my-mind-zadie-smith-review\" title=\"\"><em>Changing My Mind</em> (2009)</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/feb/06/feel-free-zadie-smith-review-essays\" title=\"\"><em>Feel Free </em>(2018)</a>, have revealed a terror of intellectual calcification. Changing her mind is essentially how Smith feels free. But it\u2019s also a trap. Even for a writer, Smith seems unusually anxious about time: wasting it, running out of it \u2013 or having it stolen from her. Time is freedom \u2013 to be curious. But aagh! Curiosity also takes a lot of time. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/21/zadie-smith-never-finished-prous-or-brothers-karamazov\" title=\"\">Smith, now 43, suffers</a> from a kind of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/apr/17/hephzibah-anderson-fomo-new-acronym\" title=\"\">intellectual Fomo</a>, a rapacious interest in everything, which means just as she\u2019s trying to knuckle down and focus, she\u2019s giving herself more work.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>The best stories here act as commentary on her fluctuations and doubts and blend her criticism with the energy and verve of her fiction</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In <em>Grand Union</em>, the \u201cparallel projects\u201d proliferate. So, too, do her cultural references, from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2004/apr/04/popandrock5\" title=\"\">hip-hop duo Dead Prez</a> to French poet and essayist Francis Ponge. There are 19 stories here, most set in the US (she teaches at New York University) and many of which ruminate on the conditions and attitudes that will best inspire creativity.</p> <p>In Downtown, the narrator is an artist in New York who is visited by an artist who lives in a Hungarian forest.

      "bodyText": "So many identities, so little time! There\u2019s a lot of breathless trying on in Zadie Smith\u2019s first collection of short stories \u2013 as if she\u2019s late to a fancy dress party but still can\u2019t decide what costume to wear. Or whether to go in fancy dress at all. Or maybe go to the cinema instead? There is autofiction here, along with formal experimentation, dystopian sci-fi, surrealism, social satire, parable and a story from the point of view of God that reads like a droll reflection on creative restlessness. \u201cTo me, it was beautiful to move between these parallel projects, never getting bogged down, not feeling defined by one way of doing things, feeling light, feeling free\u2026 Doesn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t avoidant behaviour,\u201d says the omnipotent creator in Blocked. Each of Smith\u2019s five novels, from White Teeth (2000) to Swing Time (2016), have danced from one identity to the next, shifting accent, cadence, tone. Meanwhile, her protean essay collections, Changing My Mind (2009) and Feel Free (2018), have revealed a terror of intellectual calcification. Changing her mind is essentially how Smith feels free. But it\u2019s also a trap. Even for a writer, Smith seems unusually anxious about time: wasting it, running out of it \u2013 or having it stolen from her. Time is freedom \u2013 to be curious. But aagh! Curiosity also takes a lot of time. Smith, now 43, suffers from a kind of intellectual Fomo, a rapacious interest in everything, which means just as she\u2019s trying to knuckle down and focus, she\u2019s giving herself more work. In Grand Union, the \u201cparallel projects\u201d proliferate. So, too, do her cultural references, from hip-hop duo Dead Prez to French poet and essayist Francis Ponge. There are 19 stories here, most set in the US (she teaches at New York University) and many of which ruminate on the conditions and attitudes that will best inspire creativity. In Downtown, the narrator is an artist in New York who is visited by an artist who lives in a Hungarian forest. As he leaves her apartment, he says: \u201cI don\u2019t understand how you can live here, and be an artist, amongst all this social noise and all of these people.\u201d The exchange sends the narrator into a \u201cfrenzy of self-hatred\u201d. She wonders if it\u2019s possible to live among the chaos of the city and be a \u201creal artist\u201d? Would a forest or even a jungle be more conducive? In its pace and its tangle of artistic and political angst, the tale is reminiscent of Olivia Laing\u2019s short novel Crudo, only less batty and self-satisfied. Smith shows she can pull the same autofiction trick and be funnier and more knowing. The writing in Grand Union is most alive when Smith is channelling versions of herself, that is, the storyteller (The Canker; Blocked), the teacher (Now More Than Ever), the mother (The Lazy River) or the bookish swot (Kelso Deconstructed). We find a combination of the last two in her best story, Sentimental Education, in which a harassed mum who is contemplating the menopause remembers her time at an Oxbridge college, where she and her boyfriend, Darryl, were among the few students of colour. His means of coping with the college\u2019s cloistered privileged was to bring along his schoolfriend Leon, a cheerful, tracksuited petty criminal who dossed on his floor, charming his way into the affections of everyone from the cleaners to the posh totty. It\u2019s an intriguing tale of education, class, betrayal and sexual chemistry in which the female protagonist reflects on the ways in which she has objectified men: \u201cThere were people to whom you wanted to abase yourself, and people you wanted to abase; there were people you wanted to meet on a flat playing field \u2013 which was called \u2018love\u2019, for capitalism\u2019s and convenience\u2019s sake \u2013 and people you really didn\u2019t know what to do with\u2026 wealth for somebody, but not her.\u201d This idea of inconsistency hangs over many of Smith\u2019s stories. Is consistency important? Is it even possible? She is tacitly arguing a point that she has made more explicit in essays: that it is OK to change your mind.

      "bodyText": "Joel Fitzgibbon has copped a blast in the left and right caucus meetings for declaring Labor should adopt the Coalition\u2019s Paris emissions reduction target rather than pursue ambitious cuts to carbon pollution. The internal unrest came as the shadow cabinet was expected to sign off on Monday night on a shift in Labor\u2019s attitude to the controversial \u201cbig stick\u201d policy of the Morrison government. Labor opposed the government\u2019s policy in the last parliament to create a \u201cbig stick\u201d power breaking up big energy companies if they engaged in price gouging. But it is now, assuming shadow cabinet and caucus approval, expected to allow the legislation to pass, having received assurances it will not be used as a backdoor means of privatising state-owned assets. Fitzgibbon, the shadow resources minister, who suffered a significant swing against him in his coalmining seat in the Hunter Valley in the May election, used a speech to the Sydney Institute last week to argue the ALP should offer \u201ca political and policy settlement\u201d on climate policy \u201cto make 28% the target by 2030\u201d. The unanticipated foray from the senior New South Wales rightwinger prompted internal uproar, and the shadow climate change minister, Mark Butler, promptly declared Labor would not adopt Tony Abbott\u2019s suboptimal target. \u201cThe government\u2019s target, which was developed by Tony Abbott with no expert advice, is fundamentally inconsistent with the Paris agreement,\u201d Butler told Guardian Australia. \u201cIt would lead to global warming of more than 3C and, for that reason, Labor cannot support that target\u201d. With parliament resuming on Monday after a spring break, the left and the right caucuses met separately in the evening ahead of Labor\u2019s regular caucus gathering on Tuesday morning. Guardian Australia understands that in the left caucus, more than 10 MPs spoke forcefully against Fitzgibbon\u2019s intervention, including the senior frontbenchers Tanya Plibersek and Catherine King. Butler, a South Australian leftwinger, and key Albanese backer, did not speak at the meeting but attended and received unanimous support for his position. In the right caucus, Fitzgibbon also faced criticism from within his own group, with colleagues concerned that his contribution at the Sydney Institute had been unhelpful to both Labor and to the leader, Anthony Albanese. While the majority of contributions during the right caucus discussion were sharply negative about the Fitzgibbon proposal, according to people present \u2013 with colleagues pointing out that not everybody in the faction represented a coalmining electorate \u2013 there was, however, in-principle support for having a debate about the climate policies Labor took to the 2019 election. There was concern in the right that internal discussion about Labor\u2019s climate policies before the last election had been largely restricted to the shadow cabinet rather than a more freewheeling conversation in caucus. Fitzgibbon, according to people at the meeting, launched a robust defence of his position both on the policy substance and on the politics of climate change. He contended at the Sydney Institute that ambitious climate policies had cost Labor both leaders and elections, and told colleagues on Monday night that trying to front a position where emissions were reduced to zero by mid-century would be politically fraught. Assuming an about face on the \u201cbig stick\u201d is ticked by shadow cabinet on Monday night, that will hand the Morrison government a significant win.

The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/11/england-supporters-violent-clashes-police-prague\" title=\"\">disorder in Prague</a> was relatively mild. This is where we\u2019ve got to now. A few arrests, some stun grenades, complaints from locals, smashed glass.

And before that we had France and the Euros, and the first appearance en masse of this new raft of younger, chemically-charged lads with their semi-ironical chants, their occupation of the city centres; the idea, through it all, that this is all just a bit of a laugh.</p> \n<p>Let\u2019s call it what it is. The educated English travelling boor may understand that racism is wrong. But intimidating people, smashing property for the sake of it and generally treating locals like un-people is also a public form of xenophobia. It is an offshoot of the same English blindness that says this behaviour is simply a low-level background hum, lads having too much beer.</p> \n<p>It was there in the English exceptionalism of the police briefings before these qualifiers, when it was made clear that our boys had done all they could to urge Uefa to switch the Czech game from Friday night \u2013 and yet astonishingly the Euro-wonks refused to alter the schedule to accommodate our uncontrollable minority of idiots.</p> \n<p>And yes of course this is the minority of England fans. There are so many England travelling supporters who make friends and enjoy the experience. But the fact is these issues bleed into one another and become impossible to ignore or brush aside.</p> \n<p>Hopefully there will be no need for alarm, for walk-offs and all the rest in the Levski. If there is it seems clear there should be zero tolerance of abuse.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Fiver\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  <strong>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</strong>\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>But perhaps it\u2019s time also to start applying those standards both ways, for the Football Association, the players and the manager to call on their own fans to behave better, to stow the nationalism, to respect the locals, or risk losing some of their own allocation; perhaps even to find themselves invited not to travel at all.</p> \n<p>Orwell wrote better than most about English hypocrisy and English exceptionalism. Which are, lest we forget, the best hypocrisy, the best exceptionalism in the world. Faced with Football: 2019 he would perhaps invite us to imagine the moral authority England could claim on matters of supporter behaviour if they could only bring themselves to apply these principles universally; and to begin with the strongest possible stance on their own doorstep.</p>",

The disorder in Prague was relatively mild. This is where we\u2019ve got to now. A few arrests, some stun grenades, complaints from locals, smashed glass. This is almost a victory. What Mihaylov didn\u2019t say, but might have done, is that before Prague we had Seville, and Amsterdam, and Dortmund. And before that we had France and the Euros, and the first appearance en masse of this new raft of younger, chemically-charged lads with their semi-ironical chants, their occupation of the city centres; the idea, through it all, that this is all just a bit of a laugh. Let\u2019s call it what it is. The educated English travelling boor may understand that racism is wrong. But intimidating people, smashing property for the sake of it and generally treating locals like un-people is also a public form of xenophobia. It is an offshoot of the same English blindness that says this behaviour is simply a low-level background hum, lads having too much beer. It was there in the English exceptionalism of the police briefings before these qualifiers, when it was made clear that our boys had done all they could to urge Uefa to switch the Czech game from Friday night \u2013 and yet astonishingly the Euro-wonks refused to alter the schedule to accommodate our uncontrollable minority of idiots. And yes of course this is the minority of England fans. There are so many England travelling supporters who make friends and enjoy the experience. But the fact is these issues bleed into one another and become impossible to ignore or brush aside. Hopefully there will be no need for alarm, for walk-offs and all the rest in the Levski. If there is it seems clear there should be zero tolerance of abuse. But perhaps it\u2019s time also to start applying those standards both ways, for the Football Association, the players and the manager to call on their own fans to behave better, to stow the nationalism, to respect the locals, or risk losing some of their own allocation; perhaps even to find themselves invited not to travel at all. Orwell wrote better than most about English hypocrisy and English exceptionalism. Which are, lest we forget, the best hypocrisy, the best exceptionalism in the world. Faced with Football: 2019 he would perhaps invite us to imagine the moral authority England could claim on matters of supporter behaviour if they could only bring themselves to apply these principles universally; and to begin with the strongest possible stance on their own doorstep.",

      "bodyText": "When the universal credit computer says no, fragile lives can quickly crumble. Lucy Morris, a 32-year-old mother of one in Rochdale, was scraping by on her beauty therapist\u2019s wage topped up with UC when she failed to check a box on the benefit\u2019s online form and lost a \u00a3400 payment. It was enough to torpedo her finances and before long the heating was off, vegetables were dropped from meals and the house grew filthy because she could not afford cleaning products. \u201cIt is designed to make it difficult so that they can get as many people off it as they can,\u201d she said. Mark Abraham, a married father of twins in south London, was denied a month\u2019s benefits because an automated system linking salary data from HMRC with the Department for Work and Pensions misreported his previous income from a TV production job. He showed wage slips that proved the pay was reported wrong, but jobcentre staff could do nothing. Food ran low, he broke down mentally and ended up homeless and estranged from his family. \u201cThe DWP staff appeared to be in thrall to the UC computer, allowing it to make all the decisions,\u201d he said. \u201cBeing able to tackle the computer beast that had made this decision wasn\u2019t within their capability.\u201d Mary Blyde, a 61-year-old with incontinence and learning disability, was discovered by a charity worker lying in her unheated home in Gateshead on a urine-soaked sofa after her benefit was cut. She had missed a note on her online account warning her she needed to take action. When a charity worker found her, all that was left in her cupboard were three potatoes, a can of meat and a carton of orange juice. \u201cSometimes I get scared the money won\u2019t come into my bank,\u201d she said. These are some of the lives that campaigners warn risk being forgotten as the government and its technology industry partners pour millions into automation, artificial intelligence and machine learning in the benefits system. The strategy might seem inevitable, welcome even, given its spread to other walks of life. How we use transport, watch TV and use email are all increasingly shaped by AI. Many UC claimants welcome the ability to communicate digitally rather than waiting on hold on the phone. Ministers argue digitisation will make claiming benefits more straightforward, reduce fraud and save money. The DWP\u2019s last annual report claimed investment in digital technology \u201cimproved the experiences of people who rely on our services, making us more effective and efficient, and enabling us to personalise delivery for customers and claimants\u201d. The ministry tries to create an atmosphere that will attract programmers to develop technologies for a welfare system that is used by 20 million people. There is an \u201cinnovation dojo\u201d to investigate new technologies, and its \u201cintelligent automation garage\u201d \u2013 an echo of Google\u2019s Digital Garage training centres which began in sunny California \u2013 is looking for ways to leverage the \u201cDWP data lake\u201d for \u201cimproved citizen outcomes\u201d, albeit based in a grey government building in north Newcastle. But many see the reforms as erecting digital walls around the welfare state which are now only scalable by the computer literate. A further digital transformation with robotic automation and machine learning will only make things worse, they fear. \u201cIt\u2019s massive,\u201d said Shona Alexander, chief executive of Citizens Advice in Newcastle which helps people navigate the system. \u201cThey think it\u2019s going to save money but we don\u2019t think it will. The waste from the mistakes is many times more [than the savings]. We are seeing more and more people because they have tried online and can\u2019t do it.\u201d She recalled a released prisoner who dropped in recently for help signing on for UC, could not cope with the system and said he wanted to go back inside. \u201cHe kicked off, the police came and he was arrested,\u201d she said. Charities are trying to help. Blyde, for example, relies on Gary Fawcett at the Your Voice Counts in Gateshead. He has spent 155 hours on her case, remarking: \u201cIt almost broke our project.\u201d A recent exchange on her online journal was telling. She had already lost almost \u00a31,000 in benefits because she did not know she needed to input more data, so he asked the DWP to tell her about future problems by post. \u201cMary CANNOT read or access her journal in any way,\u201d he wrote on her journal. \u201cI can no longer be sorting this out for her.\u201d The reply came: \u201cWe do not communicate by letter \u2026 this is an online service.\u201d Fawcett said again she could not access, read or input into the journal. He asked: \u201cWho is supposed to do this?\u201d The DWP replied simply that the online system needed updating, signing off: \u201cPlease do this ASAP.\u201d Fawcett is also trying to help Julian Jennings, 65, who cannot read or write, has learning disabilities and does not even know he is on UC. \u201cI have never used a computer in my life,\u201d he said as he sat at Fawcett\u2019s desk with his UC account screen open. \u201cI used to go to the dole.

      "bodyText": "All around the world, from small-town Illinois in the US to Rochdale in England, from Perth, Australia, to Dumka in northern India, a revolution is under way in how governments treat the poor. You can\u2019t see it happening, and may have heard nothing about it. It\u2019s being planned by engineers and coders behind closed doors, in secure government locations far from public view. Only mathematicians and computer scientists fully understand the sea change, powered as it is by artificial intelligence (AI), predictive algorithms, risk modeling and biometrics. But if you are one of the millions of vulnerable people at the receiving end of the radical reshaping of welfare benefits, you know it is real and that its consequences can be serious \u2013 even deadly. The Guardian has spent the past three months investigating how billions are being poured into AI innovations that are explosively recasting how low-income people interact with the state. Together, our reporters in the US, Britain, India and Australia have explored what amounts to the birth of the digital welfare state. Their dispatches reveal how unemployment benefits, child support, housing and food subsidies and much more are being scrambled online. Vast sums are being spent by governments across the industrialized and developing worlds on automating poverty and in the process, turning the needs of vulnerable citizens into numbers, replacing the judgment of human caseworkers with the cold, bloodless decision-making of machines. At its most forbidding, Guardian reporters paint a picture of a 21st-century Dickensian dystopia that is taking shape with breakneck speed. The American political scientist Virginia Eubanks has a phrase for it: \u201cThe digital poorhouse.\u201d Listen to governments, and you will hear big promises about how new technologies will transform poverty as a noble and benign enterprise. They will speed up benefits payments, increase efficiency and transparency, reduce waste, save money for taxpayers, eradicate human fallibility and prejudice, and ensure that limited resources reach those most in need. But so often, those pledges have fallen flat. At a time when austerity dominates the political landscape, millions have had their benefits slashed or stopped by computer programs that operate in ways that few seem able to control or even comprehend. Mistakes have become endemic, with no obvious route for the victims of the errors to seek redress. This week, the automation of poverty will be brought on to the world stage. Philip Alston, a human rights lawyer who acts as the UN\u2019s watchdog on extreme poverty, will present to the UN general assembly in New York a groundbreaking report that sounds the alarm about the human rights implications of the rush to digitalize social protection. Alston\u2019s analysis is based partly on his official UN studies of poverty in the UK and US, and partly on submissions from governments, human rights organisations and experts from more than 34 countries. It is likely to provide the definitive snapshot of where the world lies now, and where it is going, addressing the harassment, targeting and punishment of those living in the rapidly expanding digital poorhouse. In Illinois, the Guardian has found that state and federal governments have joined forces to demand that welfare recipients repay \u201coverpayments\u201d stretching back in some cases 30 years. This system of \u201czombie debt\u201d, weaponized through technology, is invoking fear and hardship among society\u2019s most vulnerable. As one recipient described it: \u201cYou owe what you have eaten.\u201d In the UK, we investigate the secure government site outside Newcastle where millions are being spent developing a new generation of welfare robots to replace humans. Private companies including a New York outfit led by the world\u2019s first bot billionaire, are supercharging a process which has spawned a whole new jargon: \u201cvirtual workforce\u201d, \u201caugmented decision-making\u201d, \u201crobot process automation\u201d. The government is rushing forward with its digital mission despite the pain already being inflicted on millions of low-income Britons by the country\u2019s \u201cdigital by default\u201d agenda. Claimants spoke of the hunger, filth, fear and panic that they are enduring. In Australia, where the Guardian has reported extensively on robodebt, the scheme that has been accused of wrongly clawing back historic debts through a flawed algorithm, we now disclose that the government has opened a new digital front: using automation to suspend millions of welfare payments. Recipients are finding their money cut off without notice. The most disturbing story comes from Dumka in India. Here, we learn of the horrifying human impact that has befallen families as a result of Aadhaar, a 12-digit unique identification number that the Indian government has issued to all residents in the world\u2019s largest biometric experiment. Motka Manjhi paid the ultimate price when the computer glitched and his thumbprint \u2013 his key into Aadhaar \u2013 went unrecognised.

Once up and running, our plant will provide more than enough renewable electricity and heat for the whole site, as well as for the local area.\u201d Guy Macpherson-Grant, managing director of EGS Energy, a geothermal development group that is working with Eden, said: \u201cThe geology in the county is particularly well-suited for cost-efficient heat and power generation, and St Austell benefits from particularly high heat flows.\u201d Glenn Caplin, chief executive of the Cornwall &amp; Isles of Scilly Local Enterprise Partnership, added: \u201cThis is another huge step forward in the drive to create a geothermal industry in Cornwall, using our natural assets to decarbonise our economy and create high value jobs. Renewable energy is both an environmental and an economic opportunity for Cornwall.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Australian Securities and Investments Commission has upended the way products including mortgages, insurance and investments are regulated, putting banks and other finance companies on notice that they will no longer be able to rely on the small print in contracts to rip off their customers. In a move welcomed by consumer advocates, Asic said that rather than relying on ordinary Australians to make a rational choice based on the often voluminous disclosure documents that accompany financial products, it would now use new powers to make sure finance companies did the right thing. Asic\u2019s new posture comes amid an intense backlash from the finance sector towards regulation, reflected in an intense lobbying effort against Asic\u2019s interpretation of responsible lending laws, and the announcement by the Morrison government of an inquiry by the competition regulator into the banks\u2019 failure to pass on in full the Reserve Bank\u2019s interest rate cuts. It reflects the abandonment of disclosure-based regulatory principles introduced in 1997, following the Wallis review of the finance sector, that in recent years have been steadily whittled away amid a series of scandals including shoddy financial advice and insurance rip-offs. The Asic deputy chair, Karen Chester, said the move was based on 10 years of research into the way consumers actually behave, collected from across four jurisdictions. She said the research, conducted with the Dutch financial regulator, showed that \u201cmore often than not disclosure can be ineffective and can even backfire\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s a really healthy evidence base to keep fighting the good fight \u2013 we\u2019re no longer in a world of anything goes as long as you disclose,\u201d she told Guardian Australia. She said the move also drew on commissioner Kenneth Hayne\u2019s final report following his inquiry last year into the banks. More than 50 of Hayne\u2019s recommendations related to making firms behave better, rather than providing consumers with more information. \u201cFrom Asic\u2019s perspective, the limits of disclosure are not new, but we\u2019re now in a world where the royal commission report proved more than a tilt away from disclosure,\u201d she said. And she rejected the idea that Asic was imposing too heavy a red tape burden on the financial sector. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning \u201cWe know that the rebalancing is needed because what people eloquently call a non-financial risk [not listening to your consumer] has not always been well monitored or well reported to the board,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we now know that can and has crystallised into a financial cost,\u201d she said. \u201cSome are suggesting the remediation tally (including provisioning) is now approaching $10bn.\u201d Following six years of scandals in the finance sector, and continual criticism of it as a do-nothing regulator, the government has given Asic significant new powers and it has pledged to adopt a more aggressive approach to enforcement. The regulator\u2019s new weapons include the power to ban products, the product intervention power, which it has already used four times in the past three months, and a design and distribution obligation that comes into effect in April 2021. This will require financial services companies to create products that are useful to a particular set of consumers and market it to them appropriately, rather than selling useless products to people as some have done with services such as junk insurance. Chester said the new law encapsulated \u201cjust common good business sense\u201d. \u201cI really think that\u2019s got the potential to be a game changer for not only consumers but also the firms and their boards,\u201d she said. \u201cGoing forward they\u2019ll now need to meet these obligations to say that the products you\u2019re offering to your consumers, to your market, are fit for purpose. \u201cI think business is already on notice from us.

Meanwhile, popular support for seceding from Spain \u2013 which reached a <a href=\"https://www.cataloniatoday.cat/article/1273108-record-numbers-in-favour-of-independence-for-catalonia.html\">record high of 48.7%</a> in October 2017 \u2013 is currently at 44%, with <a href=\"http://ceo.gencat.cat/ca/barometre/detall/index.html?id=7188\">48.3% of Catalans</a> in opposition.</p> <h2><strong>Has independence always been a key issue in Catalan politics?</strong></h2> <p>While some Catalans have long dreamed of independence, the issue has only risen to the fore in recent years. In 2010, support for secession hovered at about 20%.</p> <p>Calls for independence grew as Spain endured a painful and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/may/07/spain-scrapes-out-of-recession\">protracted economic crisis</a>. Artur Mas, the then Catalan president, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/11/catalan-independence-boost-barcelona-vote\">switched to supporting</a> independence in 2011 at a time of widespread anger over his centre-right Convergence and Union (CiU) party\u2019s austerity policies. Critics have accused him of a cynical manoeuvre to redirect that fury against the central government in Madrid.</p> <p>Many people in the region were also angered by the Spanish constitutional court\u2019s decision in 2010 to annul or reinterpret parts of the 2006 Catalan statute of autonomy, which would have afforded the region greater independence. </p> <h2><strong>How have successive Catalan governments tried to achieve independence?</strong></h2> <p>In short, by holding two referendums in contravention of Spain\u2019s 1978 constitution, which is founded on the \u201cindissoluble unity of the Spanish nation\u201d.</p> <p>In November 2014, Mas\u2019s government held a symbolic, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/12/catalan-president-prosecution-independence-vote\">non-binding independence referendum</a> in defiance of Spain\u2019s constitutional court, which had ruled the vote illegal. More than 80% of participants opted for independence, but only 2.3 million of Catalonia\u2019s 5.4 million eligible voters took part. Mas was subsequently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/13/catalan-ex-president-artur-mas-barred-from-holding-public-office\">barred from holding</a> public office for two years.</p> <p>Three years later, the government of Mas\u2019s successor, Carles Puigdemont, ignored warnings from the Spanish government and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/06/spanish-government-condemns-catalonia-over-independence-referendum\">country\u2019s constitutional court</a> and pushed ahead with a unilateral referendum.</p> <p>Pro-independence parties managed to get a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/06/spanish-government-condemns-catalonia-over-independence-referendum\">law </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/06/spanish-government-condemns-catalonia-over-independence-referendum\">for the referendum</a> passed in the regional parliament in early September 2017, despite furious objections from opposition MPs, who said usual procedures had been disregarded. The law was eventually struck down by Spain\u2019s constitutional court.</p> <p>The Spanish government of the then prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, also insisted the vote would not go ahead and deployed thousands of police officers to Catalonia.</p> <p>The poll, held on 1 October 2017, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2017/oct/01/catalan-independence-referendum-spain-catalonia-vote-live\">marred by violence</a> after Spanish police used force to try to stop the referendum. According to the Catalan government, 90% of participants <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/02/after-the-catalan-referendum-what-happens-next\">opted for independence</a> on a turnout of 42%.</p> <p>The police action made front-page news across the world, damaging Spain\u2019s reputation, while the referendum plunged the country into the worst political and constitutional crisis since its return to democracy.</p> <h2><strong>What happened next?</strong></h2> <p>Puigdemont signed a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/10/catalan-government-suspends-declaration-of-independence\">declaration of independence</a> nine days later but proposed its effects be suspended for two months to allow for dialogue. Pro-independence Catalan MPs nevertheless voted on 27 October 2017 to unilaterally declare independence from Spain in a session boycotted by dozens of opposition MPs.</p> <p>Less than an hour later, the Spanish senate approved the use of article 155 of the constitution, which allowed Rajoy\u2019s government to assume direct rule of Catalonia, sack Puigdemont and his cabinet, and call a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/27/spanish-pm-mariano-rajoy-asks-senate-powers-dismiss-catalonia-president\">snap regional election</a>.</p> <p>Three Catalan pro-independence parties won <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/21/catalonia-election-set-to-give-victory-to-pro-independence-parties\">47.7% of the vote</a> and 70 seats in the 135-seat regional parliament at the election in December 2017. But the single biggest winner was the centre-right, pro-unionist Citizens party, which took 37 seats.</p> <p>Direct rule was lifted in June 2018 when the new Catalan government was sworn in.</p> <h2><strong>What was the legal fallout of the referendum?</strong></h2> <p>Key members of Puigdemont\u2019s government and two leading grassroots pro-independence activists, Jordi Cuixart and Jordi S\u00e0nchez, were arrested and charged.</p> <p>Nine of the 12 defendants \u2013 who include Cuixart, S\u00e0nchez, the former Catalan vice-president Oriol Junqueras and the former Catalan parliament speaker Carme Forcadell \u2013 are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/10/catalan-independence-key-figures\">accused of rebellion</a>, which carries a prison sentence of up to 25 years.</p> <p>Puigdemont and three of his former cabinet ministers fled into self-imposed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/02/exclusive-carles-puigdemont-vows-lead-catalan-government-exile\">exile in Belgium</a> before they could be arrested.</p> <h2><strong>What will happen </strong><strong>next?</strong></h2> <p>That\u2019s the big question. The Catalan independence movement has always been characterised by its peaceful nature. The regional president, Quim Torra, has called on Catalans to <a href=\"https://elpais.com/ccaa/2019/10/01/catalunya/1569918760_700381.html\">greet guilty verdicts</a> with \u201ca huge show of non-violent civil disobedience\u201d.</p> <p>However, direct action \u2013 including the blocking of roads and railway lines \u2013 is expected from the so-called Committees for the Defence of the Republic.</p> <p>In late September, police in Barcelona <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/23/spanish-police-arrest-catalan-separatists-on-suspicion-of-terrorism\">arrested nine people</a> associated with the CDR who were allegedly planning to sabotage Catalan infrastructure. Seven of them have been <a href=\"https://elpais.com/elpais/2019/09/27/inenglish/1569568870_128248.html\">remanded in custody</a> and are accused of belonging to a terrorist organisation and possessing explosives.</p> <p>Spain\u2019s acting prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, has shown a more conciliatory approach to the independence issue than Rajoy, but has ruled out a referendum and stressed any negotiations will have to adhere to the constitution.</p> <p>S\u00e1nchez has warned his caretaker government could apply article 155 if necessary, but he has also spoken of the need for coexistence in the region.</p> <p>The independence movement, meanwhile, has lost momentum since the referendum. While Puigdemont, Torra and others favour maintaining the pressure on Madrid by following a unilateral path towards independence, Junqueras\u2019s party, the Catalan Republican Left, is pushing for a less confrontational and more practical approach.</p> <p>Whatever the supreme court verdict, any answers to the Catalan question are likely to remain as elusive as ever.</p>",

Meanwhile, popular support for seceding from Spain \u2013 which reached a record high of 48.7% in October 2017 \u2013 is currently at 44%, with 48.3% of Catalans in opposition. Has independence always been a key issue in Catalan politics? While some Catalans have long dreamed of independence, the issue has only risen to the fore in recent years. In 2010, support for secession hovered at about 20%. Calls for independence grew as Spain endured a painful and protracted economic crisis. Artur Mas, the then Catalan president, switched to supporting independence in 2011 at a time of widespread anger over his centre-right Convergence and Union (CiU) party\u2019s austerity policies. Critics have accused him of a cynical manoeuvre to redirect that fury against the central government in Madrid. Many people in the region were also angered by the Spanish constitutional court\u2019s decision in 2010 to annul or reinterpret parts of the 2006 Catalan statute of autonomy, which would have afforded the region greater independence. How have successive Catalan governments tried to achieve independence? In short, by holding two referendums in contravention of Spain\u2019s 1978 constitution, which is founded on the \u201cindissoluble unity of the Spanish nation\u201d. In November 2014, Mas\u2019s government held a symbolic, non-binding independence referendum in defiance of Spain\u2019s constitutional court, which had ruled the vote illegal. More than 80% of participants opted for independence, but only 2.3 million of Catalonia\u2019s 5.4 million eligible voters took part. Mas was subsequently barred from holding public office for two years. Three years later, the government of Mas\u2019s successor, Carles Puigdemont, ignored warnings from the Spanish government and the country\u2019s constitutional court and pushed ahead with a unilateral referendum. Pro-independence parties managed to get a law for the referendum passed in the regional parliament in early September 2017, despite furious objections from opposition MPs, who said usual procedures had been disregarded. The law was eventually struck down by Spain\u2019s constitutional court. The Spanish government of the then prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, also insisted the vote would not go ahead and deployed thousands of police officers to Catalonia. The poll, held on 1 October 2017, was marred by violence after Spanish police used force to try to stop the referendum. According to the Catalan government, 90% of participants opted for independence on a turnout of 42%. The police action made front-page news across the world, damaging Spain\u2019s reputation, while the referendum plunged the country into the worst political and constitutional crisis since its return to democracy. What happened next? Puigdemont signed a declaration of independence nine days later but proposed its effects be suspended for two months to allow for dialogue. Pro-independence Catalan MPs nevertheless voted on 27 October 2017 to unilaterally declare independence from Spain in a session boycotted by dozens of opposition MPs. Less than an hour later, the Spanish senate approved the use of article 155 of the constitution, which allowed Rajoy\u2019s government to assume direct rule of Catalonia, sack Puigdemont and his cabinet, and call a snap regional election. Three Catalan pro-independence parties won 47.7% of the vote and 70 seats in the 135-seat regional parliament at the election in December 2017. But the single biggest winner was the centre-right, pro-unionist Citizens party, which took 37 seats. Direct rule was lifted in June 2018 when the new Catalan government was sworn in. What was the legal fallout of the referendum? Key members of Puigdemont\u2019s government and two leading grassroots pro-independence activists, Jordi Cuixart and Jordi S\u00e0nchez, were arrested and charged. Nine of the 12 defendants \u2013 who include Cuixart, S\u00e0nchez, the former Catalan vice-president Oriol Junqueras and the former Catalan parliament speaker Carme Forcadell \u2013 are accused of rebellion, which carries a prison sentence of up to 25 years. Puigdemont and three of his former cabinet ministers fled into self-imposed exile in Belgium before they could be arrested. What will happen next? That\u2019s the big question. The Catalan independence movement has always been characterised by its peaceful nature. The regional president, Quim Torra, has called on Catalans to greet guilty verdicts with \u201ca huge show of non-violent civil disobedience\u201d. However, direct action \u2013 including the blocking of roads and railway lines \u2013 is expected from the so-called Committees for the Defence of the Republic. In late September, police in Barcelona arrested nine people associated with the CDR who were allegedly planning to sabotage Catalan infrastructure. Seven of them have been remanded in custody and are accused of belonging to a terrorist organisation and possessing explosives. Spain\u2019s acting prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, has shown a more conciliatory approach to the independence issue than Rajoy, but has ruled out a referendum and stressed any negotiations will have to adhere to the constitution. S\u00e1nchez has warned his caretaker government could apply article 155 if necessary, but he has also spoken of the need for coexistence in the region. The independence movement, meanwhile, has lost momentum since the referendum. While Puigdemont, Torra and others favour maintaining the pressure on Madrid by following a unilateral path towards independence, Junqueras\u2019s party, the Catalan Republican Left, is pushing for a less confrontational and more practical approach. Whatever the supreme court verdict, any answers to the Catalan question are likely to remain as elusive as ever.",

Carles Puigdemont Notably absent from the trial was Puigdemont, the architect of the region\u2019s failed independence bid.

He is currently attempting to lead a government in exile \u2013 or \u201ccouncil of the republic\u201d \u2013 from his new home in the Belgian municipality of Waterloo. A Spanish judge dropped an international arrest warrant issued for Puigdemont, 56, after a German court said it would only extradite him over alleged misuse of public funds rather than the more serious charge of rebellion. He faces immediate arrest on charges of sedition, rebellion and misuse of public funds should he return to Spain.

But while Morrison gave the UN a blast in parliament on Monday for allegedly ratcheting Australia up, it was actually the current government that agreed to an increase in ambition as part of the Paris framework which Tony Abbott signed Australia onto, and Malcolm Turnbull later ratified. During the May election campaign, Morrison told Australian voters the Coalition supported the Paris agreement and would conform with its obligations. As the Climate Change Authority has noted, Australia made a specific commitment under the Paris agreement to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by between 26% and 28% below 2005 levels by 2030, and Australia will also need to submit a more ambitious post-2030 goal in 2025 as part of the agreement\u2019s \u201creview, refine and ratchet\u201d mechanism. Post-election, as recently as June, Australian officials confirmed the Morrison government was committed to that process. Officials told the European Union \u2013 which was querying Australia\u2019s progress in emissions reduction ahead of a meeting in Bonn \u2013 that Australia would conduct domestic policy review and refine cycles aligned with the five-yearly review process under the Paris agreement. Separately to the Paris commitments, Morrison voluntarily signed on to a communique during this year\u2019s Pacific Islands Forum in August saying that all parties to the Paris agreement would \u201cformulate and communicate mid-century long-term low greenhouse gas emissions development strategies by 2020\u201d. \u201cThis may include commitments and strategies to achieve net zero carbon by 2050,\u201d the PIF communique said. Morrison began to edge away from those two commitments during his recent trip to the US. The prime minister told parliament on Monday there were \u201cthose overseas\u201d who thought Australia\u2019s 2030 target \u201cshould be higher\u201d but the government did not agree with that \u201cand neither do the Australian people\u201d because they had returned the Coalition to power in the May election. \u201cThe Australian people \u2026 supported the re-election of our government \u2026 on the basis of us going forward with a commitment to 26% reduction of emissions,\u201d the prime minister said. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Morrison declared an increase in ambition had been sought \u201cin some correspondence\u201d by the UN \u2013 presumably referring to correspondence from the UN secretary general in July asking countries, including Australia, to outline their latest emissions reduction plans. Guterres, ahead of the special UN climate summit in September that Morrison declined to attend despite being in America at the time, asked leaders to flag commitments for 2030 and their plans to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. Last week, the minister for emissions reduction, Angus Taylor, ducked questions about what \u201cnegative globalism\u201d meant in the context of Australia\u2019s participation in international climate negotiations, and sidestepped questions about Australia\u2019s emissions reduction strategy for 2050. Asked what Morrison\u2019s commitment at the Pacific Islands Forum meant, Taylor said the government was focused currently on the Paris commitments, not the next cycle. \u201cOur immediate focus is on the 2030 Paris obligation. Our focus right now is on achieving the 2030 targets.\u201d Before Morrison\u2019s comments in the House on Monday, Alex Hawke, the minister for international development and the Pacific, defended the government\u2019s climate change record, declaring the Coalition was responding to the \u201csubstantial threat\u201d facing the region. But Hawke said that some in the media acted \u201cmore as advocates and protesters\u201d rather than on reporting \u2013 echoing a similar critique from Morrison last month. The prime minister said people expressed \u201cprejudiced\u201d views about Australia\u2019s climate policy, and he added: \u201cNow where do they get their information from?

      "bodyText": "Kurdish-led forces in control of north-east Syria have reached a deal with the Assad regime to stave off a bloody five-day-old Turkish assault, as more than 700 people with links to Islamic State have escaped from a detention camp in the area. Kurdish fighters controlling the region would surrender the border towns of Manbij and Kobane to Damascus in a deal brokered by Russia, officials said on Sunday night. Syrian state media said units from President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s army were moving north to \u201cconfront Turkish aggression on Syrian territory\u201d. Unconfirmed reports said the deal between the Kurds and the regime would be extended to apply to the whole of north-east Syria. \u201cAfter everything, it seems that the fate of the Kurdish people [is to be abandoned]. We did everything that we could, we called upon the international community \u2026 but it did not result in a solution. We urged all Kurdish [groups] to show solidarity, but no one listened,\u201d Ismat Sheikh Hassan, the leader of the military council in Kobane, told local television. The deal is likely to be a bitter end to five years of semi-autonomy for Kurdish groups in north-east Syria, forced by Ankara\u2019s offensive on the area. Turkey\u2019s Operation Peace Spring started on Wednesday after Donald Trump\u2019s announcement that US forces would withdraw from the region. Trump had not specified a timeframe for the US withdrawal from Syria, but on Sunday US defence secretary Mark Esper said the remaining 1,000 special forces in the country had been ordered to leave \u201cas safely and quickly as possible\u201d as the fighting between Turkey and the SDF began to threaten US military positions. The area\u2019s Kurdish-led fighters, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), have been funded and trained by the US to combat Isis since 2015, finally defeating the militant group in March after losing 11,000 troops in the battle. Turkey, however, says the largest unit of of the SDF, the Kurdish YPG, is a terrorist group indistinguishable from the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 party (PKK), which has fought an insurgency against the Turkish state for decades. Trump\u2019s decision to abandon the SDF to an inevitable Turkish assault has been widely criticised even by his staunchest allies as a betrayal of a US military partner which has unleashed to a humanitarian disaster and threatens to sow the seeds of Isis\u2019 resurgence amid the chaos. On Sunday, at least 750 people with suspected links to the militant group reportedly fled a displacement camp in north-east Syria. France voiced its concern at the report. Government spokeswoman Sibeth Ndiaye told France 3 television: \u201cI do not know, today, who exactly the people are who fled from the camp; it has been a worry for France since the beginning of this armed intervention.\u201d France has been hit by a wave of jihadist attacks since 2015, many claimed or inspired by Isis, and has expressed concerns that a Turkish assault would bolster the group. On Monday, the French presidency said in a statement it was taking measures to protect its personnel inside Syria. \u201cMeasures will be taken in the coming hours to ensure the safety of French military and civilian personnel present in the zone as part of the international coalition fighting Islamic State and humanitarian action,\u201d the statement said. The women and children formerly part of the \u201ccaliphate\u201d had been held in a secure annexe at the Ain Issa camp. They began to riot and scared away the guards after Turkish shelling struck close to the area on Sunday, said Abdulkader Mwahed, the joint president for humanitarian affairs in the Kurdish-held part of Syria. The UK-based monitor the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights put the number to have escaped at 100, publishing pictures of men, women in black niqabs and small children running through yellow scrubland. The camp was home to a total of about 13,000 people, including three suspected British orphans and a British recruiter for Isis, Tooba Gondal. Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan\u2019s stated goal is to create a 20-mile-deep \u201csafe zone\u201d on its border with the SDF, enough to keep Turkish border towns out of the range of shelling and rocket fire. However, Ain Issa and other Kurdish-held roads and towns south of the proposed safe zone have been hit by airstrikes and shelling. Syrian rebel proxies fighting on behalf of Turkey were pushing south and refused to allow the town of Manbij to fall into regime hands, a fighter with the Syrian National Army (SNA) rebel umbrella group said, reporting that Turkey had begun shelling the SDF-held town west of the Euphrates. A convoy of 40 armoured Turkish trucks travelled into Syria from the Jarablus border crossing to reinforce the Turkish offensive, another military source said. Speaking on Sunday, Erdo\u011fan rejected offers for mediation with the SDF and criticised his western Nato allies for standing by what Turkey considers to be a terrorist organisation. He also dismissed the reports of escaped Isis prisoners as \u201cdisinformation\u201d aimed at provoking the US and other western countries. About 130,000 people have been displaced in Syria in the five-day-old operation so far, with at least 60 civilian casualties in Syria and 18 dead in Turkey after counterattack SDF shelling of Turkish border towns. The SNA summarily executed nine civilians including a female politician, a human rights monitor has claimed. The umbrella group said it had ordered an investigation and commanders were to \u201ccontinuously supervise combatants on the frontlines to prevent any abuse\u201d.

I talked about strategic composition in the region and I focused on foreign policy with some criticism but this was considered because I do think that, whether you look at his most recent speech at the Lowy Institute, where he rails against negative globalism, his decision on Jerusalem, where he sought to walk away from a bipartisan position on Jerusalem when he first became prime minister, when you look at his language on China, this is a prime minister who is prepared to play domestic politics and domestic political tactics and foreign policy in a way I have not seen. </p> <p>The Lowy speech was interesting and disturbing. Disturbing because it was lightweight but also because it broke from <strong>Julie Bishop\u2019s</strong> white paper. </p> <p>The one [plan] the government had was a rules-based order and [to] work multilaterally in our region to achieve that and we have an Australian prime minister doing what really no prime minister has done, of either persuasion, which is railing against global cooperation at a time when we need it. </p> <p>You cannot be an isolationist and free trader.

Scott Morrison appeared to downplay it so it does look from the outside like another tactically domestically focused press conference.</p> <p>... Of course it matters how you handle the relationship as well as what decisions you make. This is not just about substance. That is important. But it\u2019s also about how you handle rhetoric and advocacy. </p> <p>But my concern is, we don\u2019t appear to have a plan when it comes to dealing with an increasingly challenging relationship with China, which is becoming more assertive and more willing to present interests.

She may be interested to know that, in the year 2017, the amount paid out under the Farm Household ... Allowance was $33,735,000. In the numbers we received this morning, the number was $114,00155,000. </p> <p>Since since the drought summit of last year, as I referred to in an earlier answer today, we have made some very significant changes to the Farm Household Allowance. And we didn\u2019t make those changes unilaterally. The minister for drought, then minister for agriculture, commissioned a review of the Farm Household Allowance and went out and spoke directly to all those affected in the sector through that independent review process. </p> <p>That independent review process recommended that we go from three years to four years - and for that four years to be four in every 10. Four in every 10. I remind the member that, when the Labor party was in power, it was three years only - for life, Mr Speaker. Three years for life. The member for Hunter. </p> <p>We increased that to four years in 10, and we are now, in this year most recently completed, we have put $114.2 million to support those families and to ease up on the compliance requirements and the assessment requirements that has enabled more of those families \u2013 some 6,000 now \u2013 which, when Labor was in, numbered only around 300 or thereabouts, Mr Speaker. Mr Speaker, I hear before that the drought had just started. </p> <p>... We learnt in Queensland today, in the minister for drought\u2019s electorate, it\u2019s been going for eight years. It\u2019s been going for eight years, Mr Speaker. </p> <p>So in all of that period of time, what we have done \u2013 and what we have most recently done through the National Drought Summit \u2013 has been to increase access to that payment. And we will continue to consult closely with the community when it comes to making any further changes if they are considered necessary. </p> <p>But we\u2019re acting in accordance with the advice, Mr Speaker, and the head of the farmers in Queensland has been very, very clear about the need to maintain those arrangements as they\u2019ve been set. </p> <p>So we\u2019re going to listen to the farmers and listen to the rural communities, and that\u2019s why, in just the last few weeks, since we sat in this place, we\u2019ve put \u2013 together with the New South Wales government \u2013 over $1 billion into new dams and upgraded dams. </p> <p>We\u2019ve put, Mr Speaker, over $60 million into additional farm household assistance just since we have come back to this parliament. On top of that, we\u2019ve put an additional $14 million into drought-affected local government areas to ensure that we can keep those local economies moving. Mr Speaker, we will continue to respond to the drought as and when and each and every day as we need to, and that will go on into the future with our full support. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-14T04:30:50.835Z\">at 5.30am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5da3f43b8f083d8b3b9db582\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-14T04:07:43.287Z\">5.07am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>We get a bipartisan note, with both<strong> David Littleproud </strong>and <strong>Anthony Albanese</strong> mourning the couple who died in the NSW bushfires, and praising the firefighters who have worked to keep the fires as contained as possible.<br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-14T04:18:51.908Z\">at 5.18am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5da3f32a8f083d8b3b9db57d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-14T04:03:36.763Z\">5.03am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Anthony Albanese </strong>to <strong>Scott Morrison:</strong></p> <p>Today, the prime minister has refused to give a straight answer to questions about record household debt, about record-low wage growth, and about whether he tried to invite <strong>Brian Houston</strong> to the White House.

And I make reference to a number, Mr Speaker, about policy positions that the Australian government has been urged to change. I\u2019m happy to name them, leader of the opposition. </p> <p>There are those who are overseas who think that our commitment to 26% reduction emissions by 2030 should be changed. And it should be higher, Mr Speaker. And we don\u2019t agree. And neither do the Australian people. \u2018Cause we took it to an election, Mr Speaker. And the Australian people said \u2013 and supported \u2013 the re-election of our government, Mr Speaker, on the basis of us going forward with a commitment to 26% reduction of emissions.

I can remember when the UNHCR used to write to us and say we should change our policies. We don\u2019t agree. Does the Labor party agree that we should be changing our border protection rules to comply with the international issues, whether it\u2019s the UNHCR or any other organisations, when it\u2019s in conflict with the express policies of the Australian people taking to election, Mr Speaker? </p> <p>But I return to the issue of emissions reduction. We are in no doubt about our policy on this side of the House. 26% reduction in emissions by 2030. But on that side of the House, the member, Mr Speaker, for Hunter \u2013 he actually agrees with us. He thinks it should be 26%, Mr Speaker. </p> <p>(The government benches go nuts)</p> <p>Not only that, but the deputy thinks it as well. There\u2019s a lot of support for the member for Hunter\u2019s ideas, but sadly not from the member for Sydney.</p> <p>She reserves her right to perfectly disagree with the member for Hunter, so she\u2019s still for the 45% target, Mr Speaker. Then we can go across to the member for Kingsford Smith \u2013 I should say, the member for Wills \u2013 who says he doesn\u2019t know. He says, \u201cWe don\u2019t have the answers right now,\u201d Mr Speaker. Then there\u2019s another position which was put forward ...\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Tony Smith </strong>pulls him on relevance and for straying from the question. Morrison says he was responding to an interjection, but Smith says he didn\u2019t hear one.

Then, what do they think about 0.5%, as we inherited from the Labor party when we came to office, Mr Speaker? </p> <p>Mr Speaker, the Labor party condemns themselves from their own mouths, Mr Speaker, when it comes to their own track record, when it comes to managing the economy. </p> <p>Maybe the member opposite wants to look up the size of the deficit when they left office, Mr Speaker, or all the other matters, Mr Speaker, in which Labor set fire to the budget when they were in office. </p> <p>Mr Speaker, I\u2019m also asked about household debt. I\u2019m asked about household debt. And the treasurer gave, I think, a very good answer about the issues around household debt. But one of the things that I would also add to that is that households themselves are proving to be very effective in how they\u2019re managing their own debt. The House may not know that there is a three-times coverage - three years in advance, that is, that people have been able to build offsets against their mortgages. And they\u2019ve been doing that, Mr Speaker, in a very prudential way. </p> <p>And one of the big differences between Australia\u2019s household debt and household debt in other parts around the world is this: Australia\u2019s rental housing market - 30% of the entire housing market - is owned by mums and dads who invest in investment properties. </p> <p>And if those mums and dads didn\u2019t invest in those investment properties, we would not have the rental stock that is available to people to rent today. And what was Labor\u2019s policy when it came to rents at the last election? To whack a big, fat housing tax on mums and dads who were simply investing in the rental stock of Australians who are renting to put a roof over their heads. The Labor party has never understood the economy. They\u2019ve never understood how to manage money. The economy and the country\u2019s finances has never been safe in Labor\u2019s hands, and the Australian people know it, Mr Speaker. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-14T03:42:59.871Z\">at 4.42am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5da3eb8f8f083d8b3b9db553\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-14T03:30:11.166Z\">4.30am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>For anyone interested <strong>Paul Karp </strong>and<strong> Luke Henriques-Gomes </strong>have factchecked the government\u2019s talking points for you<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/oct/14/the-prime-ministers-office-accidentally-sent-out-its-talking-points-we-fact-checked-them\">The prime minister's office accidentally sent out its talking points.

We\u2019ve got to understand this isn\u2019t the first of these fish death events; in fact there\u2019s been over 600 in New South Wales alone in the past 30 years. But what we\u2019ve got to do is equip our water managers with the tools to be able to manage the waterways and the natural environment better and that\u2019s why we made an $80m response after the Vertessy report to make sure that these events are minimised into the future.</p> <p><strong>Question:</strong> Look, I\u2019m sure listeners will be thinking why did it take a disaster and such a crisis for everyone to realise there was such terrific strains on the system. What is your answer ultimately?</p> <p><strong>DL:</strong> Well as I said, these \u2013 this isn\u2019t a new event. Fish deaths happen from this, over the last the last 30 years we\u2019ve had 600 of them. The reality is how do we equip our water managers better with the tools and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve looked at and made sure that with the science, $20m extra in science, to equip them with the understanding of how the water moves through the system.</p> <p> What you\u2019ve also got to understand is that the water that was released that many say caused this event, actually created the largest spawning event of Murray cod in our nation\u2019s history. So the water that was released out of Menindee did have an environmental benefit. The water managers used the information they had in front of them at the time that conditions were going to be normal in the sense that rainfall may have come through to replenish it, but it didn\u2019t and obviously that was where a lot of the issues came from so we\u2019ve made sure that we\u2019ve invested in the science and technology to equip them to make better decisions and also make sure that those water flows get through. With using even satellite technology, we\u2019ve invested more than 20-odd million dollars into satellite and remote river sensing to make sure that the flows that are for the environment get through to the environment.</p> <p><strong>Question:</strong> You did say in a statement that it was a major wake-up call and with the drought still ongoing, isn\u2019t it the case there are many options open in terms of water management? There\u2019s virtually no environmental water left over for the northern area the moment.</p> <p><strong>DL:</strong> Well exactly right. Unfortunately until it rains, it hits the landscape and runs into the rivers. No one has been able to create water and the only way we can is from rain. And so what we need to do is prepare our water managers with the tools to be able to manage that and the community has a role to play, we all have a role to play. There\u2019s reporting in making sure we understand where the hot spots are now and we\u2019ve actually got an interactive map that community can be part of in identifying where they\u2019re seeing water quality diminish and also the lack of water coming through. We\u2019re making sure that we\u2019re working with our state authorities and also making sure that we get this right through simple technology such as aerators, putting them into parts of the river that have stopped the flow to keep the oxygen moving so that we don\u2019t get these fish death events to the extent we did last year.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-14T00:37:40.725Z\">at 1.37am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5da3bc808f08b13ca7c79ed9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-14T00:10:04.324Z\">1.10am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>I see in the comments there are some eyebrows being raised about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/oct/13/michael-lavarch-to-review-nsw-labor-after-shocking-allegations-at-icac\">latest inquiry Labor has ordered</a> (this time in NSW Labor, for what should hopefully be obvious reasons).</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/politics/leaders-told-to-lead-and-stop-passing-the-buck-to-bureaucrats/news-story/57ed5a56d286e5c9ab289a4bba92b5c5\">So you might find this article in the Australian interesting:</a><br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong>Jeff Kennett </strong>and <strong>Campbell Newman</strong> have called on governments to wrest back control from bureaucrats and take firm action on major decisions, as it emerged that t<strong>he Morrison government had commissioned and endorsed 72 reviews in the past year.</strong></p> <p>Analysis of reviews and inquiries supported by the federal government since September last year reveals a range of decisions deferred to departments, agencies and commissions for consideration.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-14T00:12:59.537Z\">at 1.12am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5da3b7708f083d8b3b9db4a5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-13T23:47:38.240Z\">12.47am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>It is also anti-poverty week.</p> <p>From<strong> Linda Burney\u2019s</strong> office:<br></p> <ul> <li>3 million or 13.2% of Australians live below the poverty line \u2013 when defined as 50% of median income; </li> <li>739,000 children or more than one in six Australian children live below the poverty line; </li> <li>Those on Newstart and Youth Allowance experience poverty at the highest rates; and </li> <li>As many as one in five Australians have experienced <a href=\"https://alp.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=942ebc4c1cf8fc522a4f4c50e&amp;id=087f14ab7e&amp;e=2804e40e87\">food insecurity</a> in the last year.</li> </ul> <p>But hey \u2013 as <strong>Michael McCormack </strong>has told us, you can just drive to another town and get a job.

The remaining 20% will be deposited in their regular account. </li> <li>A second drug test will be scheduled within 25 working days of the positive result.

It is not intended to be a wage replacement.</li> <li>The Morrison government is delivering the job opportunities with more than 1.4 million jobs created since the Coalition was elected. We are also providing pathways to jobs and breaking down barriers unemployed Australians face getting back into the workforce.</li> <li>Newstart allowance is just one element of our comprehensive social security and welfare system which include additional supplements and allowances, concessional access to healthcare, and targeted support through employment services all play a role in supporting people whilst they transition back into the workforce.</li> <li>Jobs growth and supporting jobseekers to fulfil mutual obligations with employment services and through activities designed to improve their job prospects has contributed to the improved lifetime cost of welfare as well as the significant reduction in people entering the welfare system and reduced persistency of payments.</li> <li>The proportion of Australians receiving working-age income support payments has fallen to its lowest level in 30 years at 14.3%t.

We know who they are. They are not putting their lives at risk, or the lives of their children at risk, by getting on a boat.</li> <li>We won\u2019t be taking any advice from Labor, whose mismanagement of our border was an absolute disgrace.</li> <li>Labor\u2019s boat arrivals saw 50,000 people arrive unlawfully, 8,000 children were forcibly placed in detention, 1,200 people lost their lives, 17 detention centres were opened \u2013 all at a cost to the Australian taxpayer of $17bn.</li> </ul> </ul> <blockquote> <p><em>If asked about worker exploitation</em></p> </blockquote> <ul> <ul> <li>The exploitation of any worker in Australia is something we have zero tolerance for.</li> <li>We take a whole of government, multi-agency approach when it comes to the exploitation of foreign workers \u2013 this includes the Australian federal police, the Australian Border Force, state and territory police, the Australian Taxation Office and the fair work ombudsman.</li> <li>Labor claim to be concerned about worker exploitation, but when they were last in government they decimated the fair work ombudsman\u2019s funding by more than $20m, cut their staff by 23% and had no policy to protect vulnerable workers.</li> <li>We have legislated to increase penalties for worker exploitation by up to tenfold, increased the powers of the fair work ombudsman to enforce the law, and increased their resources by over $50m and 60 new staff.</li> </ul> </ul> <blockquote> <p><em>Labor\u2019s border protection policies</em></p> </blockquote> <ul> <ul> <li>Abolish temporary protection visas.</li> <li>Abolish the fast-track assessment process for boat arrivals.</li> <li>Increase our permanent refugee intake by 71%t, cost of $6bn.</li> <li>Labor has already, through partnering with the Greens, passed a law that removes the government\u2019s ability to determine who comes to Australia from Manus or Nauru.</li> <li>The leader of the opposition voted to ban boat turn-backs.

I\u2019m going to go out on a limb and suggest that we will have been taken off the government talking point distribution list by then. A massive thank you to Mike Bowers, Katharine Murphy, Sarah Martin and Paul Karp. And to everyone you don\u2019t see, who work behind the scenes keeping it all going. Of course, the biggest thank you, as always, goes to you. Thank you for joining us today. We\u2019ll be back soon. In the mean time \u2013 take care of you. Zali Steggall on her inclusion on the (latest) family law inquiry: I am very pleased to have been confirmed on the family law inquiry. Relationship breakdowns are a highly emotional time and this inquiry needs to be balanced and handled sensitively to ensure our family law system works the best way possible in all areas, both in property and parenting disputes. Pauline Hanson has been promised the deputy chair role in that family law inquiry. Here is how she has been promoting her involvement: The joint select committee into Australia\u2019s family law system has just been announced \u2013 the House members anyway. They are: Kevin Andrews Llew O\u2019Brien Fiona Martin Zali Steggall For the Greens motion to be successful they would need both Centre Alliance and Jacqui Lambie to vote to shut the family law inquiry down. At this stage Centre Alliance\u2019s Rex Patrick is holding the line that Pauline Hanson\u2019s public comments about domestic violence don\u2019t invalidate the whole process. He told Guardian Australia: \u201cI often strongly disagree* with remarks Pauline Hanson makes, but I respect that she is a member of the Senate and was voted for by a number of people. Her remarks taint her own reputation, they will have no effect on the committee itself, which is made up of 10 parliamentarians.\u201d *An earlier version of this post had an unfortunate typo. Rex Patrick often strongly disagrees with Pauline Hanson, not agrees, as I first had. Sorry. We have a statement from the joint security and intelligence committee: Today the Chair of the Parliament\u2019s Intelligence and Security Committee tabled its Advisory report on the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment (2019 Measures No. 1) Bill 2019. The Chair of the Committee, Mr Andrew Hastie MP said \u201cThis Bill makes changes that are designed to keep Australians safe. It implements a COAG agreement to ensure a presumption that neither bail nor parole will be granted to those persons who have demonstrated support for, or who have links to, terrorist activity. This decision followed the terrorist attack in Brighton, Victoria in June 2017. The perpetrator of that attack was on parole for State offences, and had previously been charged with conspiracy to commit a terrorist attack.\u201d The Bill: amends the existing presumption against bail in section 15AA of the Crimes Act so that it covers persons charged with or convicted of a terrorism offence, amends section 19AG of the Crimes Act to require a court, when sentencing a terrorist offender who is under the age of 18, to fix a non-parole period of three-quarters of the head sentence unless the court is satisfied that exceptional circumstances exist to justify a shorter non-parole period, and provides that exculpatory material does not need to be included in a continuing detention order application where the material would be the subject of a claim for Public Interest Immunity. The Committee has recommended amendments so that the onus is on the Australian Federal Police Minister to satisfy the Court that any excluded exculpatory information is protected by Public Interest Immunity. This addresses the concerns raised by submitters whilst ensuring that the intended aim of the amendment is achieved. The Greens will be moving a motion to dissolve the Kevin Andrews chaired inquiry into the family law system. From Larissa Waters: The Greens will introduce a motion in the Senate today to dissolve the damaging Joint Select Committee Inquiry into Australia\u2019s Family Law System, for vote tomorrow. Greens co-deputy leader and spokesperson on women, Senator Larissa Waters, said the inquiry was already ramping up the risk to women and children. \u2018Australia\u2019s family law system has serious problems which need addressing, however this inquiry is politically motivated and should not go ahead,\u2019 she said. \u2018The Greens are in discussion with other parties and with Senators who may have changed their minds about supporting this inquiry, which is stacked with extremists that have pre-determined, non-expert opinions on violence against women and their children. \u2018There are serious concerns from experts, service providers and women in the community that the inquiry will make women less safe, and that victims and survivors of family violence and abuse do not feel safe giving evidence to the inquiry.\u2019 Speaking of the Senate, Arthur Sinodonos will deliver his Senate valedictory speech on Wednesday afternoon. He\u2019s off to be our man in Washington. Malcolm Roberts, the servant of Queensland and the nation, is now refusing to vote on government bills in the Senate, as part of a One Nation standoff to have the dairy industry regulated. Roberts just said this in the Senate: As a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia, I want to make comments on the National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation Amendment bill 2019. Let me first say that in support of Senator Hanson\u2019s decision to not vote on legislation, other than critical legislation, until the government has addressed the plight of dairy farmers, I will not be voting on this bill. Pauline Hanson has announced the vote ban will apply to \u201cnon-critical legislation\u201d but I guess PHON will decide what is critical and what is not. To pass legislation Labor and the Greens disagree on, the government needs four of the six Senate crossbenchers to pass legislation. Usually that\u2019s Cory Berardi and One Nation, and then either Centre Alliance or Jacqui Lambie. Without One Nation, Centre Alliance AND Lambie become crucial. But again, we don\u2019t know what counts as non-critical legislation. On the speech Penny Wong delivered to the Australian Institute of International Affairs, which, for her, was quite political, Wong had this to say: I thought very carefully about this speech. As you would know, it is not usual for me to have such political attack in a foreign speech. I talked about strategic composition in the region and I focused on foreign policy with some criticism but this was considered because I do think that, whether you look at his most recent speech at the Lowy Institute, where he rails against negative globalism, his decision on Jerusalem, where he sought to walk away from a bipartisan position on Jerusalem when he first became prime minister, when you look at his language on China, this is a prime minister who is prepared to play domestic politics and domestic political tactics and foreign policy in a way I have not seen. The Lowy speech was interesting and disturbing. Disturbing because it was lightweight but also because it broke from Julie Bishop\u2019s white paper. The one [plan] the government had was a rules-based order and [to] work multilaterally in our region to achieve that and we have an Australian prime minister doing what really no prime minister has done, of either persuasion, which is railing against global cooperation at a time when we need it. You cannot be an isolationist and free trader. He claims he wants free trade, more trade, but he does not like multilateral institutions, which presumably include the World Trade Organisation which is critical to Australia. On Peter Dutton\u2019s comments on the Chinese Communist party, Penny Wong says: I would like to make a couple of points. We are different society to China under the Chinese Communist party. And I have made the point for quite a long time. And inevitably with our democracy [we] will have differences of views on a range of issues between us and China. My question to Peter Dutton is \u2013 was [it] a thought-through plan? Was it part of the clear strategy or part of a political tactic because ...it\u2019s very difficult to tell where the government\u2019s strategy on China is. If you accept that we are, as we are, an ally and partner of the US, and we have an important economic relationship with China, you want to make sure you have assessable strategy in dealing with [a] China which is much more assertive, but we are going to have differences of views on whether the relationship is more challenging. ... Scott Morrison appeared to downplay it so it does look from the outside like another tactically domestically focused press conference. ... Of course it matters how you handle the relationship as well as what decisions you make. This is not just about substance. That is important. But it\u2019s also about how you handle rhetoric and advocacy. But my concern is, we don\u2019t appear to have a plan when it comes to dealing with an increasingly challenging relationship with China, which is becoming more assertive and more willing to present interests. There will be times when we our interests converge, and we will engage closely, but times where our interests are different. On Scott Morrison\u2019s visit to the United States, Penny Wong says: What was interesting \u2026 is that [the prime minister] didn\u2019t achieve anything through that trip when it came to the trade war between China and the US. And certainly there are a lot of other distractions that the prime minister chose to engage in, including discussion about China\u2019s status at the WTO bank and he made that announcement in the US, but fundamentally I think it was to distract from the fact that we have a deep interest, both for stability reasons and for economic reasons, in the trade dispute being comfortably resolved. Penny Wong is the guest on Afternoon Briefing today. Wong tells Patricia Karvelas she believes Scott Morrison is very short sighted in his strategy on foreign policy: My point is this, it\u2019s a very challenging time in foreign policy, with a very challenging regional and global environment, and a very challenging time in our relationship with China. It would be best if those issues were managed with very clear on the national interest and in a bipartisan manner. And what we have is a Prime Minister who does seek partisan advantage, who does it to manoeuvre and play tactical gains. Paul Karp with a balloon update: Just on Scott Morrison\u2019s answer on negative globalisation, where he cited examples of times the UN has asked Australia to change its policy \u2013 I guess it\u2019s positive globalisation when we do it? Because that\u2019s a fairly common part of diplomacy and being part of the international stage. For instance, we have recently expressed our concerns to Turkey over its policy in north-eastern Syria. As we should. We finish up with a dixer from Greg Hunt on health spending. The folders are stacked though, so we are done. Lisa Chesters to Scott Morrison: Why does the prime minister\u2019s talking points say that the government recognises how tough drought is when he is withdrawing Farm Household Allowance from hundreds of drought-stricken farm families? Morrison: I thank the member for her question. She may be interested to know that, in the year 2017, the amount paid out under the Farm Household ... Allowance was $33,735,000. In the numbers we received this morning, the number was $114,00155,000. Since since the drought summit of last year, as I referred to in an earlier answer today, we have made some very significant changes to the Farm Household Allowance. And we didn\u2019t make those changes unilaterally. The minister for drought, then minister for agriculture, commissioned a review of the Farm Household Allowance and went out and spoke directly to all those affected in the sector through that independent review process. That independent review process recommended that we go from three years to four years - and for that four years to be four in every 10. Four in every 10. I remind the member that, when the Labor party was in power, it was three years only - for life, Mr Speaker. Three years for life. The member for Hunter. We increased that to four years in 10, and we are now, in this year most recently completed, we have put $114.2 million to support those families and to ease up on the compliance requirements and the assessment requirements that has enabled more of those families \u2013 some 6,000 now \u2013 which, when Labor was in, numbered only around 300 or thereabouts, Mr Speaker. Mr Speaker, I hear before that the drought had just started. ... We learnt in Queensland today, in the minister for drought\u2019s electorate, it\u2019s been going for eight years. It\u2019s been going for eight years, Mr Speaker. So in all of that period of time, what we have done \u2013 and what we have most recently done through the National Drought Summit \u2013 has been to increase access to that payment. And we will continue to consult closely with the community when it comes to making any further changes if they are considered necessary. But we\u2019re acting in accordance with the advice, Mr Speaker, and the head of the farmers in Queensland has been very, very clear about the need to maintain those arrangements as they\u2019ve been set. So we\u2019re going to listen to the farmers and listen to the rural communities, and that\u2019s why, in just the last few weeks, since we sat in this place, we\u2019ve put \u2013 together with the New South Wales government \u2013 over $1 billion into new dams and upgraded dams. We\u2019ve put, Mr Speaker, over $60 million into additional farm household assistance just since we have come back to this parliament. On top of that, we\u2019ve put an additional $14 million into drought-affected local government areas to ensure that we can keep those local economies moving. Mr Speaker, we will continue to respond to the drought as and when and each and every day as we need to, and that will go on into the future with our full support. We get a bipartisan note, with both David Littleproud and Anthony Albanese mourning the couple who died in the NSW bushfires, and praising the firefighters who have worked to keep the fires as contained as possible. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: Today, the prime minister has refused to give a straight answer to questions about record household debt, about record-low wage growth, and about whether he tried to invite Brian Houston to the White House. Why won\u2019t the prime minister just give straight answers, whether it\u2019s here or in media interviews? Morrison: Mr Speaker, once again, the leader of the opposition comes to the dispatch box and he casts a whole range of aspersions across the table, Mr Speaker, without being able to back them up. The problem is, the leader of the opposition doesn\u2019t like the answers to the questions, Mr Speaker. He doesn\u2019t like the fact that, when it comes to our economy, we continue to be one of the strongest-growing developed countries in the world, that we\u2019re continually providing jobs for Australians, and that 1.4 million Australians have been able to find work, that our AAA credit rating has been maintained, that taxes have been reduced, Mr Speaker, under our government, and that we continue to provide support to the farmers and rural and regional communities of this country, including protecting those very farmers from those who would seek, Mr Speaker, to go and invade their farms and create even further anxiety and insult at a time when they are under greatest pressure. Morrison moves into a bunch of government talking points, concluding before there can be a Tony Burke point of order. Labor has also been focusing on Scott Morrison\u2019s Lowy speech in Senate question time, asking whether he was referring to the UN when he warned of an \u201cunaccountable internationalist bureaucracy\u201d. Foreign minister Marise Payne took the opportunity to read extensive quotes from before the offending phrase in the speech, more generic sections about threats in the strategic environment. Labor raised multiple points of order on relevance, but president Scott Ryan agreed with the minister that the content of the speech was all relevant. Labor\u2019s Penny Wong suggested the prime minister had \u201chumiliated\u201d Payne and Julie Bishop \u201cwould\u2019ve stood up and fought\u201d against the talking points. Payne responded that Labor was selectively quoting the speech. She said that the world suffered from \u201cpeak commentary\u201d \u2013 presumably international institutions lecturing Australia \u2013 and the PM was \u201ctrying to navigate a path through that in the national interest. Asked about the related warning of \u201cnegative globalism\u201d, Payne said Morrison was seeking \u201can approach to globalism that facilitates/aligns rather than directs and centralises\u201d which she said was \u201cnot provocative, [but] considered\u201d. Peter Dutton does his usual LABOR IS TERRIBLE ON BORDER SECURITY but it is not as firey as usual. Richard Marles to Scott Morrison: I refer to reports in the Wall Street Journal that the prime minister was determined to bring Brian Houston to the White House, with several rounds of discussions between Canberra and Washington before the White House vetoed the idea. Why won\u2019t the prime minister give a straight answer to this question: \u201cDid the prime minister or his office seek to have Brian Houston invited to the White House?\u201d Morrison: Thank you, Mr Speaker, and I refer the member to my previous answer about how invitations are issued, Mr Speaker. It is not my practice to go around commenting on the unsourced reports, Mr Speaker, and just respond to the rumours that go around this place. The member opposite might want to engage in that but, if the member opposite wants to make comments about the individual in question ... Anthony Albanese gets up on relevance: It is Question Time for a reason \u2013 there\u2019s questions and there\u2019s answers. The prime minister has just said ... My point of order goes to relevance. The prime minister can\u2019t say \u201cI\u2019m just not answering.\u201d He\u2019s got to actually answer questions in this place. That\u2019s what it\u2019s for. Tony Smith rules the answer in order. Morrison continues: I responded to the question, Mr Speaker, but I do ask, Mr Speaker, in the way that the question has been put to this House, that if they are suggesting anything serious or casting any aspersions on the individual which is the subject of the question, then perhaps I suggest they go and attend that church and they explain their concerns directly to their parishioners. Albanese is not happy with that. NOT AT ALL. The pair, who attended and had a laugh together at the National Prayer Breakfast this morning, continue to argue across the table. Morrison turns his back on Albanese, but turns back, to answer something else. That is fairly unusual \u2013 the pair usually leave the politics to the despatch box. It has to be said, although I know that the PMO will disagree, but Morrison was a little nervous before getting up to answer those questions. He does this thing where he shakes the paper a little, and continually folds over the same spot when he is nervous. The hands were moving like crazy in that answer. Richard Marles to Scott Morrison: Did the prime minister or his office seek to have Brian Houston invited to the White House? Morrison: As the member knows, the invitations were handled by the White House, so that\u2019s a matter for the White House. I think the Australian people are more interested in who Jamie Clements was inviting to dinner, and how much cash was in the wine bag. He\u2019s pulled up on relevance, but Morrison has already concluded his answer. Paul Fletcher got very worked up in his lickspittle. Something about no one having moved from welfare to work under Labor. Weird flex, but OK It pains me to say I missed an interjection during the prime minister\u2019s answer on which multilateral institutions were pushing us towards negative globalism. Ed Husic wanted the prime minister to refer to the Illuminati or Agenda 21. As an agent of the deep state, I can assure you agents are already on the mention of the Illuminati and Beyonc\u00e9 is being notified as we speak. Paul Fletcher is now basically reading from the government\u2019s talking points on welfare. Richard Marles to Scott Morrison: Which multilateral institutions was the prime minister talking about when he warned about the dangers of negative globalism? Morrison (with a lot of shouting): I thank the member for his questions about my speech to the Lowy Institute which I understand he doesn\u2019t share my views that Australia\u2019s national interests should always come first and take priority over the agendas of global institutions, Mr Speaker ... I\u2019m surprised that the member opposite thinks that global institutions should be telling the Australian public about what should be happening in this parliament, Mr Speaker. And I make reference to a number, Mr Speaker, about policy positions that the Australian government has been urged to change. I\u2019m happy to name them, leader of the opposition. There are those who are overseas who think that our commitment to 26% reduction emissions by 2030 should be changed. And it should be higher, Mr Speaker. And we don\u2019t agree. And neither do the Australian people. \u2018Cause we took it to an election, Mr Speaker. And the Australian people said \u2013 and supported \u2013 the re-election of our government, Mr Speaker, on the basis of us going forward with a commitment to 26% reduction of emissions. The other thing we recently had some correspondence from the UN, Mr Speaker \u2013 from the UN \u2013 we had some correspondence ... Anthony Albanese jumps up to ask about relevance. Morrison continues: I was making reference, as I was about to, on border protection issues, Mr Speaker, where we have been written to by the UN saying we should change our policies. I can remember when the UNHCR used to write to us and say we should change our policies. We don\u2019t agree. Does the Labor party agree that we should be changing our border protection rules to comply with the international issues, whether it\u2019s the UNHCR or any other organisations, when it\u2019s in conflict with the express policies of the Australian people taking to election, Mr Speaker? But I return to the issue of emissions reduction. We are in no doubt about our policy on this side of the House. 26% reduction in emissions by 2030. But on that side of the House, the member, Mr Speaker, for Hunter \u2013 he actually agrees with us. He thinks it should be 26%, Mr Speaker. (The government benches go nuts) Not only that, but the deputy thinks it as well. There\u2019s a lot of support for the member for Hunter\u2019s ideas, but sadly not from the member for Sydney. She reserves her right to perfectly disagree with the member for Hunter, so she\u2019s still for the 45% target, Mr Speaker. Then we can go across to the member for Kingsford Smith \u2013 I should say, the member for Wills \u2013 who says he doesn\u2019t know. He says, \u201cWe don\u2019t have the answers right now,\u201d Mr Speaker. Then there\u2019s another position which was put forward ...\u201d Tony Smith pulls him on relevance and for straying from the question. Morrison says he was responding to an interjection, but Smith says he didn\u2019t hear one. We eventually come to the end with this: While you may not have heard any interjections from your left, I can assure you the member for Hunter does. The Labor party is riven with division on climate change. #welldoneJoel Apparently our space program is another example of how we are helping our farmers, according to Karen Andrews. I think we are getting to the link here somewhere (and I\u2019m hoping its not we are going to mine an asteroid for water, because I have seen that movie and it doesn\u2019t end well). Oh, nope, there we go. Satellites. Satellites help farmers. Also, something about Mars. Labor\u2019s Katy Gallagher has asked finance minister Mathias Cormann about the Reserve Bank\u2019s decision to cut interest rates to 0.75%. But she\u2019s done it with a twist, quoting Cormann\u2019s own words when he warned of interest rates at \u201cemergency levels\u201d under Labor, when he argued the RBA had \u201cnot cut rates because the economy is doing well\u201d. Cormann responded that the RBA had responded to the \u201cinternational context\u201d, and particularly the need to cut because of low global interest rates. Funny, he didn\u2019t mention anything about household spending. This is what the RBA said on that subject: \u201cThe main domestic uncertainty continues to be the outlook for consumption, with the sustained period of only modest increases in household disposable income continuing to weigh on consumer spending.\u201d But there are plenty of good stats for Cormann to deploy: 28 years of continuous economic growth, 1.4m new jobs, and Australia\u2019s AAA credit rating. Cormann adds that RBA governor Phil Lowe \u201cexpects the economy to gradually strengthen\u201d due to income tax cuts, infrastructure spending and the stabilisation of the property market. Rob Mitchell gets booted for asking Dan Tehan to table the document he was talking from, as there is no mention of education in the talking points. Worth it. Tanya Plibersek to Dan Tehan: Isn\u2019t it true that, under this government, the number of Australians doing an apprenticeship or a traineeship is lower than it was a decade ago? So why has this government cut $3 billion from Tafe and training? Tehan: LABOR CUT FUNDING (this is not a quote, but it is the general vibe) Meanwhile, no one is mentioning the Scott Cam contract, which I don\u2019t know, doesn\u2019t seem like the greatest way to appeal to teenagers. Not that we know how much the Cam contract has cost, because for some reason, that is being kept under wraps. Cool, cool, cool (which Scott Cam is not, btw. I don\u2019t make the rules.) Peta Murphy has the next question for Scott Morrison: Can the prime minister confirm that this Liberal government\u2019s record on wages growth is worse than any previous government? Is this a contributing factor to record household debt? Morrison: I thank the member for her question and I\u2019m pleased to inform the House - again - that in the most recent through-the-year figures in the national accounts, that real wages growth was running at 0.7% a year. (\u201cIt\u2019s a runaway train,\u201d someone from Labor yells.) Well, Mr Speaker, I note the interjections of those opposite who seem to think that 0.7% is not satisfactory. Then, what do they think about 0.5%, as we inherited from the Labor party when we came to office, Mr Speaker? Mr Speaker, the Labor party condemns themselves from their own mouths, Mr Speaker, when it comes to their own track record, when it comes to managing the economy. Maybe the member opposite wants to look up the size of the deficit when they left office, Mr Speaker, or all the other matters, Mr Speaker, in which Labor set fire to the budget when they were in office. Mr Speaker, I\u2019m also asked about household debt. I\u2019m asked about household debt. And the treasurer gave, I think, a very good answer about the issues around household debt. But one of the things that I would also add to that is that households themselves are proving to be very effective in how they\u2019re managing their own debt. The House may not know that there is a three-times coverage - three years in advance, that is, that people have been able to build offsets against their mortgages. And they\u2019ve been doing that, Mr Speaker, in a very prudential way. And one of the big differences between Australia\u2019s household debt and household debt in other parts around the world is this: Australia\u2019s rental housing market - 30% of the entire housing market - is owned by mums and dads who invest in investment properties. And if those mums and dads didn\u2019t invest in those investment properties, we would not have the rental stock that is available to people to rent today. And what was Labor\u2019s policy when it came to rents at the last election? To whack a big, fat housing tax on mums and dads who were simply investing in the rental stock of Australians who are renting to put a roof over their heads. The Labor party has never understood the economy. They\u2019ve never understood how to manage money. The economy and the country\u2019s finances has never been safe in Labor\u2019s hands, and the Australian people know it, Mr Speaker. For anyone interested Paul Karp and Luke Henriques-Gomes have factchecked the government\u2019s talking points for you Dave Sharma has the next lickspittle question, on the ACCC inquiry. \u201cIt\u2019s page five,\u201d Anthony Albanese tells his benches. They all dutifully turn their pages to page five. \u201cThis is word for word,\u201d Jim Chalmers yells. Labor MPs are now mouthing along with Josh Frydenberg as he gives his answer. Graham Perrett appears to be having a particularly great time. Anika Wells, who is not a previous treasurer, despite being the member for Lilley, has the next question: Why won\u2019t the prime minister confirm that household debt is now nearly double disposable income, higher than it has ever been? Frydenberg: The member for Lilley \u2013 who may not have learned any economics from her predecessor, Mr Speaker ... we hope not, we hope not ... The George Costanza, Mr Speaker... The value of household sector assets is five times greater than its debts. And importantly, around three-quarters of the debt is owed by households in the top 40% of the income distribution, Mr Speaker. And they\u2019re generally at a higher capacity to make repayments and are less likely to go through a period of sustained unemployment, Mr Speaker. And then it is just a bunch of yelling. It\u2019s not quite Fatman Scoop, but still. Josh Frydenberg has just proven he knows how microphones work though. So there is that. Meanwhile, politicians really should be banned from using Dorothea Mackellar\u2019s poem as proof that Australia has been in drought before. WE GET IT The government really, really, really wants to talk about what it is doing about the drought. Helen Haines has the independents\u2019 question and it is to David Littleproud: The minister today wrote in an opinion piece, \u2018Our drought strategy is clear.\u2019 This morning, Fiona Simpson, president of the NFF, said, \u2018Unfortunately, Australia remains without a national drought strategy.\u2019 Like many farmers around the country, I\u2019m bamboozled. Can the minister clarify \u2013 does the government actually have a drought strategy and is the strategy the minister referred to the one the NFF doesn\u2019t agree exists \u2013 a strategy which was written in 1992 when the minister himself was 16 years old? A bit of millennial shaming there, but that\u2019s part of the game. Littleproud: (refer to the government talking point on drought for the answer) Jim Chalmers to Scott Morrison: Is the prime minister aware of any year when household debt was higher than it is now? Morrison: I thank the member for his question on household debt. Household debt does continue to trouble the government. And the pressure that it places on families. And that is one of the reasons why, Mr Speaker, we provided the tax relief - through this parliament - when we were re-elected on May 18 to ensure that we could be taking the pressure off families - particularly those on low- and middle-incomes - so they could be able to meet ... the ... increasing challenges that they do on their household budgets. And of course, a big part of that, Mr Speaker, is the things that they owe. But the good thing in Australia is the times\u2019 coverage when it comes to household debt \u2013 the treasurer will correct me if I\u2019m wrong \u2013 but it\u2019s about five times, five times, Mr Speaker, the asset coverage to the debt coverage, and it\u2019s predominantly within the housing sector. If the shadow treasurer thinks there is a significant issue in terms of the credit-worthiness of the Australian housing market, which underpins the credit position of Australians in this country, then he should say so. He should say that. But he won\u2019t say that, because he knows it\u2019s not true. The shadow treasurer once again is seeking to talk down the Australian economy and, Mr Speaker, talk down and create anxiety about issues, Mr Speaker, which are being well-managed by Australians - and conscientiously managed. We really are back in 2016 Labor\u2019s shadow foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, has started Senate question time by asking what Australia has done about the Turkish military operation in northern Syria. Foreign minister Marise Payne said the operation will \u201ccertainly cause additional civilian suffering\u201d, displacement of people, and risk the return of Daesh [Isis], a \u201cserious threat\u201d to regional security. She paints a picture of a full court press \u2013 with Australia engaging Turkish diplomats in Canberra, Ankara, talks with the US secretary of state Mike Pompeo, the French president Emanuel Macron, and talks with her Turkish counterpart. Wong then asks about Donald Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw US troops. Payne responds that Turkey (not the US) is \u201ctotally responsible\u201d for the decision it has made through the incursion, the \u201chumanitarian suffering\u201d and the \u201cdetention, custody and escape of any Daesh fighters\u201d. She refuses to go into the content of talks with Pompeo. Payne said Australia is \u201cvery concerned\u201d about the possibility Daesh, despite its territorial defeat, could regain the capability for \u201cviolent extremist activity\u201d in the Middle East and more broadly. But it does give me an opportunity to watch Darren Chester attempt to crouch down to speak to the crossbench, and witness the seven circles of hell pass over his face. Barnaby Joyce can add inflicting Michael McCormack on us to his list of sins. He starts with this: I don\u2019t have my talking points \u2013 I think they went to the member for Hunter, because the member for Hunter is very much onboard with our climate policy ... I don\u2019t know what else he says because I have metaphysically thrown myself off the press gallery balcony. Tony Burke tries to have the prime minister table his talking points, but Scott Morrison says he wasn\u2019t quoting from anything. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: Where in the prime minister\u2019s talking points for today is the prime minister\u2019s description of the banking royal commission as \u201chollow populist nonsense\u201d, and how is this description consistent with his new inquiry announced today? Will he just say anything at any time when it\u2019s convenient? Morrison: I thank the leader of the opposition for his question. As he may recall, I was the treasurer that initiated the banking royal commission, Mr Speaker ...[Labor dissolves into laughter]... I don\u2019t recall a banking royal commission being initiated by the member for McMahon when he was treasurer, or the member for Lilley when he was treasurer. I don\u2019t remember that at all, Mr Speaker. I remember there was this government that took that action, and it\u2019s now this government that is acting on the recommendations of the royal commission through the good work of the treasurer, Mr Speaker. And now is taking further steps \u2013 just as we were doing from when we came into government, Mr Speaker, and particularly even before the royal commission reported \u2013 we introduced the Banking Executive Accountability Regime, we increased the resources for Asic and Apra, and we made sure they had the powers available to them to do the work they need to do, Mr Speaker. So we\u2019re taking action. And I\u2019ll tell you who we\u2019re taking action for when it comes to the banking sector, Mr Speaker \u2013 that\u2019s for bank customers, Mr Speaker. That\u2019s who needs the greater competition that we want to see in this sector \u2013 for small business lenders as well \u2013 that\u2019s why we\u2019ve put $2 billion into the Small Business Securitisation Fund to deepen and widen the pool of capital available for these new lenders to get their hands on, to provide even better business opportunities to small businesses. Mr Speaker, our government has a real plan, and is implementing a real plan to ensure we get greater competition, greater accountability and better outcomes out of our banking and financial system to support those who want to go and buy a home, for those who want to go and run a business, for those who need that support to sustain them through the drought they\u2019re facing now. That\u2019s what we\u2019re putting in place, Mr Speaker. When those opposite were in this place \u2013 when those opposite were in this place, Mr Speaker, when it came to the needs of those who were customers of the banking and financial sector, they just simply looked the other way. Rowan Ramsey, who always looks like an extra in a Dickens novel to me, is the first lickspittle. Please refer to the government talking points on the drought for Scott Morrison\u2019s answer. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: The prime minister\u2019s talking points for today say \u201cthe major banks have decided to put their profits before their customers\u201d. If that\u2019s the case, why did the treasurer say, just nine days ago, \u201cI\u2019m not focused on new inquiries\u201d \u2013 only to announce a new inquiry on interest rates today? Josh Frydenberg takes this one. He again seems to have forgotten how microphones work over the spring break. On this side of the House, we\u2019re focused on CONSUMERS MR SPEAKER! We\u2019re focused ON LOWER BORROWING COSTS. Lower borrowing costs. For the Labor party, you had the member for Rankin out there last week calling for higher levies on the banks, Mr Speaker. Because for every question, the Labor party HAS THE SAME ANSWER \u2013 higher taxes, higher levies. The reality is, we have announced today a very significant new inquiry by the ACCC. And this inquiry will be looking at the pricing of the nearly $2 trillion residential mortgage market, Mr Speaker. And what we need to understand better is the difference in prices that the banks offer their existing customers and new customers, Mr Speaker \u2013 otherwise known as the front book and the back book, Mr Speaker. What we need to know in better detail is the difference between the advertised price and the actual price paid, Mr Speaker. And what we need to do is to understand if there are barriers for customers to switch banks in order to get a better deal. So on this side of the House, Mr Speaker, we stand for loyal bank customers and getting the best possible deal for them. I expect Darren Chester might find it a little difficult jumping up and down during question time today, after he completed his first marathon over the weekend. It took a little longer than two hours, but congrats to everyone who crosses that finish line. It\u2019s more than I could ever do (I look like a drunk baby giraffe which has been crossed with a confused duck when I run). This has prompted a lot of MPs to get their skin checks done \u2013 when was the last time you had yours? The sincerest form of flattery? We are in the chamber, where the member for Fairfax, Ted O\u2019Brien, is today\u2019s \u201cWho\u2019s that MP?\u201d It\u2019s the downhill slide to question time \u2013 hit me up with your predictions! The SBS political editor, Brett Mason, has followed up on his FOI request into how much Melissa Price\u2019s recent overseas trip cost (the department came back with a total of $2,515 for 142 hours\u2019 work processing the request) with a statement from the minister herself: \u201cThe department arrived at the FOI cost estimate on its own and my office was not consulted,\u201d Minister Price said in a statement to SBS News. \u201cI am more than happy for the costs of my official travel to the UK and Europe last month to be released under normal FOI processes.\u201d Anna Bligh, the spokesperson for the Australian Banking Association, has given the banks\u2019 response to the ACCC inquiry. She says it\u2019s a \u201ccomplicated\u201d process, but that she hopes that it will show people what goes into the decisions. I look forward to an inquiry that is genuinely and authentically focused on casting more light for the public on the many factors that go into making up our interest rates. I don\u2019t want to pre-empt the outcome of the inquiry, but I do hope that, at the end of it, Australians will have a clear understanding of the many factors that determine their interest rates. The One Nation members have so far raised just $240 of their $15,000 total. The reason the members who created the PHON page want Pauline Hanson removed from the executive and James Ashby gone is: 1. To expel James Ashby from One Nation (Pauline Hanson\u2019s One Nation), and all divisions, for life. &gt; The reason being for bringing One Nation into disrepute due to his actions over the past few years. Ie the American trip to the National Rifle Association with Steve Dickson (Senate candidate), the scuffle and fight with former One Nation Senator Brian Burston in Parliament House last year, the One Nation aeroplane saga and investigations that came with it and for other headlines that have hit the media. 2. To remove Pauline Hanson as President for Life of One Nation federal division. &gt;The reason being that One Nation should be democratic and members should be able to nominate for executive positions within the party. This is also for the better management of the party, which will in the future minimise any litigation that the party may encounter, due to any poor decisions. One Nation has been subjected to this in the past, with Pauline Hanson even being put in jail. You may not be a supporter of Pauline Hanson or One Nation but One Nation is a political party that was intended to hold the major political parties to account. Without democracy in this party, this will never happen. Once again: these are the words from PHON\u2019s supporters. Sarah Vogler from the Courier Mail first reported this on the weekend, but it deserves another look. One Nation appears to be charging its members to attend its AGM this Saturday. As Vogler reported, members have set up a Go Fund Me page because they want to be able to send enough members to the meeting to knock Pauline Hanson off as \u201cpresident for life\u201d and also \u201cexpel James Ashby from One Nation and all divisions, for life\u201d. From the Go Fund Me page: Political parties in Australia should be democratic. When a person joins a political party as a member, they are all entitled to attend the organisation\u2019s AGM and have voting rights. Unfortunately, at the upcoming One Nation annual general meeting on the 19th October, many members will not be able to attend due to the exorbitant attendance fee that the One Nation executive are charging ($150 a ticket and $100 for pensioners). In this case, many members have not even been invited to the AGM. The One Nation executive is headed by Pauline Hanson, who has made herself President for Life, and Pauline\u2019s advisor is James Ashby, who is also a member of One Nation. Pauline Hanson is a Queensland senator, which is more than a full-time job. There are many party members who are of the opinion that Pauline needs to concentrate on her Senate work and leave other capable people to manage the executive and finances of One Nation. Unfortunately, because Pauline has not had the time to dedicate to the management of the One Nation political party, there are party members that believe that she has trusted and let the wrong people in to manage the party. Pauline cannot do every job herself and One Nation and Queensland need all jobs done efficiently and properly. This GoFundMe is to raise money for those members who cannot afford to attend the AGM, to pay for their tickets to go, and vote on important party decisions. To put the One Nation party back on track to being a democratic party once again, some members would like to be able to attend and back the following motions at the meeting. Rod Simms is talking on the ACCC inquiry into banks not passing on the interest rate cuts: This inquiry is going to help us understand what decisions banks make in relation to mortgage interest rates, how they make them, why they make them, what implications there are for consumers and for the community in general. The banking sector that is a very important one. The mortgage rates that consumers pay are often the most important financial transactions that they make. We want to make sure that the customers, consumers, community really understand exactly how banks make their decisions, why they make their decisions, there is often a lot of confusion amongst customers in relation to the big difference between the headline rate, the standard variable rate they see and what people actually pay. It is important to understand why that behaviour happens. It is often quite confusing and frustrating for customers. So we are very interested in finding out what we can to inform customers, inform the community, see where we can improve competition in the banking sector, see where we can get consumers getting better deals under the interest rates. For those looking for the grand plan of why the government\u2019s talking points were released, may I direct you to the age-old adage of \u201ccock-up over conspiracy\u201d. There is nothing in there we did not know. There is nothing in there that has not been made public before. It is interesting from a lol perspective, because these things aren\u2019t supposed to be mass mailed out to the media, and interesting from a news perspective because it shows you what the government believes its vulnerabilities are and the lines it has come up with to counter it. But there is no grand conspiracy. Cassandra Goldie from the Australian Council of Social Services says there is at least one obvious way the government could address Australia\u2019s poverty statistics \u2013 increase Newstart: The majority of the Senate, all lower house crossbenchers and the opposition all support an increase to Newstart, along with more than 70% of the community and a wide range of organisations, including the Council of Small Business Australia, the Business Council of Australia and the Country Women\u2019s Association. \u201cWe\u2019ve also heard from members of the government that they also support raising Newstart, which has not had a real increase in 25 years, while living costs have gone through the roof. This Anti-Poverty Week, it\u2019s time for the government to get on board and finally fix the country\u2019s major fairness failure. By increasing Newstart, the government can act on poverty while providing much-needed economic stimulus, creating jobs, including in regional areas. Raising the rate will get Newstart working by allowing people to focus on their futures rather than having to be totally consumed with their current situation of financial crisis. We already know what the government is going to say though. It\u2019s the same thing they have been saying since last year. David Littleproud was on RN this morning, and was asked about the latest episode of fish kills in the Murray-Darling Basin: DL: Yeah well look obviously after that horrific event last year, the federal government and the basin state governments came together to make sure that we had a strategy to work together to collaborate and to make sure that we minimise the impacts of these events. We\u2019ve got to understand this isn\u2019t the first of these fish death events; in fact there\u2019s been over 600 in New South Wales alone in the past 30 years. But what we\u2019ve got to do is equip our water managers with the tools to be able to manage the waterways and the natural environment better and that\u2019s why we made an $80m response after the Vertessy report to make sure that these events are minimised into the future. Question: Look, I\u2019m sure listeners will be thinking why did it take a disaster and such a crisis for everyone to realise there was such terrific strains on the system. What is your answer ultimately? DL: Well as I said, these \u2013 this isn\u2019t a new event. Fish deaths happen from this, over the last the last 30 years we\u2019ve had 600 of them. The reality is how do we equip our water managers better with the tools and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve looked at and made sure that with the science, $20m extra in science, to equip them with the understanding of how the water moves through the system. What you\u2019ve also got to understand is that the water that was released that many say caused this event, actually created the largest spawning event of Murray cod in our nation\u2019s history. So the water that was released out of Menindee did have an environmental benefit. The water managers used the information they had in front of them at the time that conditions were going to be normal in the sense that rainfall may have come through to replenish it, but it didn\u2019t and obviously that was where a lot of the issues came from so we\u2019ve made sure that we\u2019ve invested in the science and technology to equip them to make better decisions and also make sure that those water flows get through. With using even satellite technology, we\u2019ve invested more than 20-odd million dollars into satellite and remote river sensing to make sure that the flows that are for the environment get through to the environment. Question: You did say in a statement that it was a major wake-up call and with the drought still ongoing, isn\u2019t it the case there are many options open in terms of water management? There\u2019s virtually no environmental water left over for the northern area the moment. DL: Well exactly right. Unfortunately until it rains, it hits the landscape and runs into the rivers. No one has been able to create water and the only way we can is from rain. And so what we need to do is prepare our water managers with the tools to be able to manage that and the community has a role to play, we all have a role to play. There\u2019s reporting in making sure we understand where the hot spots are now and we\u2019ve actually got an interactive map that community can be part of in identifying where they\u2019re seeing water quality diminish and also the lack of water coming through. We\u2019re making sure that we\u2019re working with our state authorities and also making sure that we get this right through simple technology such as aerators, putting them into parts of the river that have stopped the flow to keep the oxygen moving so that we don\u2019t get these fish death events to the extent we did last year. I see in the comments there are some eyebrows being raised about the latest inquiry Labor has ordered (this time in NSW Labor, for what should hopefully be obvious reasons). So you might find this article in the Australian interesting: Jeff Kennett and Campbell Newman have called on governments to wrest back control from bureaucrats and take firm action on major decisions, as it emerged that the Morrison government had commissioned and endorsed 72 reviews in the past year. Analysis of reviews and inquiries supported by the federal government since September last year reveals a range of decisions deferred to departments, agencies and commissions for consideration. It is also anti-poverty week. From Linda Burney\u2019s office: 3 million or 13.2% of Australians live below the poverty line \u2013 when defined as 50% of median income; 739,000 children or more than one in six Australian children live below the poverty line; Those on Newstart and Youth Allowance experience poverty at the highest rates; and As many as one in five Australians have experienced food insecurity in the last year. But hey \u2013 as Michael McCormack has told us, you can just drive to another town and get a job. SIMPLES. This was bound to happen Honestly - the government could save itself the hassle of releasing its talking points - it has Michael McCormack. Exhibit A \u201cWe want to build dams, we are building dams, we are getting on with the job.\u201d In other news, the coffee stain on my desk has suddenly taken on Daniel Craig levels of magnetism. Annelise Nielsen from Sky News takes one for the nation and speaks to Michael McCormack, so you don\u2019t have to. He is very excited about the new dam which was announced over the weekend. He is a walking talking point, and just as interesting. This is also ticking away today. I mean.... Penny Wong was also asked about Gladys Liu. She says the most telling part of the whole saga was that Scott Morrison, along with the rest of the government, were unwilling to stand up in parliament and say that Liu was a \u201cfit and proper person\u201d to sit in parliament. Penny Wong on Scott Morrison\u2019s speech to the UN (Wong is speaking at the Australian Institute of International Affairs): I think the prime minister should explain what he meant in that speech. There are two points in that speech. The most and most important one, we are a trading nation. Australian jobs demand open, fair and transparent trading arrangements and that is why Australia and the Coalition have been supportive of the trade organisation. Scott Morrison wants, for domestic political purposes, to rail against globalism but he is pro free-trade. You cannot be pro free trade and go against globalism. Rebekha Sharkie has introduced a private members\u2019 bill to raise the age of criminal responsibility in Australia from 10 to 14, in line with international standards. Here is what she had to say about it on Sunday, when she released her statement on the issue: Our current laws are not consistent with the medical and social science evidence we have about the mental capacity of children who commit offences and the detrimental effects early contact with the justice system have on our children,\u201d Sharkie said today. We also know that our current laws have a disproportionate impact on Indigenous children with almost 70% of the young people in our youth jails being Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children. It\u2019s been almost two years since the Northern Territory\u2019s 2017 royal commission into the protection and detention of children recommended raising the age of criminal responsibility. Meanwhile children as young as 10 continue to be arrested and detained for relatively minor offences when we should be looking at diversionary justice processes instead. We need to acknowledge the evidence and we need to act so Centre Alliance is moving legislation for the government to consider and take up.\u201d One for the diary: On Wednesday, 16 October 2019, Democracy 2025 will release a new report that explores the ways in which federal politicians would like to reform Australia\u2019s democracy. The report is the fifth in a series of reports developed by Democracy 2025 that examine how to strengthen democratic practice and bridge the trust divide in Australia. The director of Democracy 2025, Professor Mark Evans, will present the report at a special event at Parliament House. Wednesday, 16 October, 12pm \u2013 1.30pm Committee Room 2S3, Australian Parliament House Panellists include: \u00b7 Professor Mark Evans, director of Democracy 2025 and co-author of the report \u00b7 Michelle Grattan AO, chief political editor at the Conversation \u00b7 Dr Helen Haines MP, member for Indi \u00b7 Hon Tanya Plibersek MP, member for Sydney \u00b7 Dave Sharma MP, member for Wentworth \u00b7 Professor Gerry Stoker, centenary professor of governance, Institute for Governance and Policy Analysis at the University of Canberra and co-author of the report The bells are ringing, and with them, a sense of pervading doom settles over us all. The Greens will be pushing for the parliament to declare a climate emergency. Adam Bandt spotted this on the way into Canberra Someone in Labor has crunched the words on the government\u2019s talking points, and found they mention Labor, or Anthony Albanese, about 40 times. As the great Regina George would say \u201cWhy are you so obsessed with me?\u201d The National Prayer Breakfast was held this morning. Seems the tea was hot. From AAP: Aged care royal commission chair Richard Tracey QC has died. The former federal court judge died on Friday, the aged care royal commission announced on Monday at the beginning of a Melbourne public hearing examining workforce issues. Commissioners Lynelle Briggs said Tracey died in California, where he was being treated for cancer diagnosed seven weeks earlier. Australian Associated Press is reporting the aged care royal commission chair Richard Tracey has died. We will bring you more on that when we can. The House and Senate are both about to sit: The committee for the latest inquiry into the family law court will most likely be announced today. That\u2019s the one Pauline Hanson has been elevated to deputy-chair on, despite her already having announced her (abhorrent and evidence-less) views going into it. There has been a push on to have Zali Steggall \u2013 who has a background in family law \u2013 to sit on the committee. We\u2019ll see if that pays off. In brighter news, the annual \u201cGirls Takeover Parliament\u201d event is on this week. It\u2019s run by Jasiri Australia, which is a \u201cyouth-led, expert-guided social enterprise committed to seeing gender equality in our communities and in our leadership\u201d. The bipartisan event will see 60 young women paired up with MPs and senators. At the end of the event a charter will be presented to Scott Morrison. Meanwhile, the parliamentary inquiry into the worst of all hours \u2013 question time \u2013 continues. The parliament is looking at how it, and other parliamentary procedures, could be made better. Question time is the one hour of parliament that is broadcast. Which means it is the one hour of parliamentary proceedings that most people see. And it\u2019s a joke. It is an absolute farce, which does nothing to promote trust and faith in our democratic system. It is ridiculous theatre that leaves every person who takes part in it worse. That\u2019s just my opinion of course (DEATH TO DIXERS) but it seems, from the submissions the inquiry has received so far, to be a common opinion. If you can\u2019t be bothered putting in a submission, you can take this survey the committee has set up , which is open until 31 October. And on the ACCC inquiry announced today by Josh Frydenberg, the government wants you to know: ACCC BANK INQUIRY The government has directed the ACCC to undertake an inquiry into the pricing of residential mortgage products, particularly after the banks failed to pass on the RBA\u2019s recent interest rate cuts in full. The Inquiry will focus on the period from 1 January 2019. Since this date, there have been three cuts (June, July and October) by the RBA to the official cash rate. Together these cuts have reduced the cash rate by 75 basis points, and the big four banks have passed on an average 57 basis points in owner-occupied home loan rates. The major banks have decided to put their profits before their customers, and that\u2019s not a good outcome for their customers or the economy. As the Reserve Bank governor pointed out recently \u201clower interest rates put more money into the hands of the household sector and, at some point, this extra money gets spent and this helps the overall economy.\u201d The inquiry will ensure the pricing practices of the banks are better understood and made more transparent by; understanding how banks make pricing decisions for residential mortgages \u2013 which is particularly important in the current context of banks not passing on the RBA rate cuts in full. assessing how prices differ for new and existing customers. investigating barriers to switching. The inquiry will consider pricing across the entire residential mortgage market by major banks, smaller banks, and non-bank lenders. But the big four banks will be a key focus of this inquiry, given they hold around 75% of residential mortgage debt. The government is committed to increasing competition in banking and promoting good consumer outcomes in the mortgage market to ensure that consumers can get a better deal. The consumer data right provides consumers with greater access to their personal information giving them power to securely transfer their banking data to other providers to get a better deal. This is one of a number of policies the government is implementing to increase competition. If asked how this differs to the royal commission and previous ACCC inquiries? The financial services royal commission specifically focused on misconduct rather than the way that banks are pricing their mortgages. The ACCC\u2019s previous residential mortgage price inquiry specifically focused on whether the major bank levy affected the prices charged for residential mortgages. The government has also decided to acknowledge the IMF climate report which said Australia would fail to meet its Paris target: We\u2019re taking meaningful action to reduce global emissions with our $3.5bn climate solutions package that will deliver the 328 million tonnes of abatement needed to meet our 2030 Paris target. Our national target is achievable, balanced and responsible, and is part of coordinated global action to deliver a healthy environment for future generations while keeping our economy strong. In the electricity sector, we are reducing emissions while maintaining reliable and secure supply: The latest official projections show the national electricity market (NEM) is on track to be 26% below 2005 levels by 2022, eight years early. On the back of $25bn of committed investment in clean energy, Australia leads the world with more than double the per capita investment of countries like France, Germany and the UK: If asked \u2013 IMF climate change report saying we will not meet our 2030 target: We\u2019ll meet our target without introducing a carbon tax. When Labor were in government and introduced a carbon tax, energy prices went up and industry threatened to take jobs offshore. The IMF report does not take into account our $3.5bn package which maps out to the last tonne how we will deliver the 328mt of abatement needed to reduce emissions to 26 to 28% below 2005 levels by 2030. The report also states that under a $75 carbon tax, retail electricity prices would increase by 70-90% in Australia. That is not something we are going to do to Australian households and small businesses. When asked about that on Friday, Josh Frydenberg seemed to miss the question and answered along the lines of \u201cWho said that? Labor?\u201d which is a standard response these days. The government is also pretty into what the party who is not in government is doing. Joel Fitzgibbon has given them some extra steam here: LABOR DIVISION ON ENERGY POLICY Joel Fitzgibbon has backflipped on his recent calls for a carbon tax and again presented yet another position on energy policy \u2013 this one driven by self-interest to save his own seat, following huge swings against him at the recent election. Meanwhile Bill Shorten and Penny Wong have recently said they are \u201cproud\u201d of Labor\u2019s reckless 45% target and made the case to keep it. This follows calls by the assistant climate change spokesman Pat Conroy to scrap their 45% emissions reduction target but Labor change spokesman Mark Butler won\u2019t commit to anything. Whether it\u2019s \u201cChairman Swanny\u201d calling for Labor to keep their $387bn tax and spend agenda or Fitzgibbon looking back to the future then doing a backflip, Labor haven\u2019t learned the lessons from the election and want to rehash policies Australia has comprehensively rejected. We\u2019re taking meaningful action to reduce global emissions with our $3.5bn climate solutions package that will deliver the 328 million tonnes of abatement needed to meet our 2030 Paris target. Under our government Australia leads the world with more than double the per capita investment of countries like the UK, France and Germany. But the best thing about this one, is that the government actually admits that emissions have increased (at least through its notes). For the records, emissions have increased every year since 2014, when the carbon price was scrapped. If asked: recent increases in emissions: Emissions fell 0.4% over the first quarter of 2019. Emissions for the year to March 2019 are up 0.6 % or 3.1 Mt. This small increase is due to an 18.8% increase in LNG exports. LNG production related emissions increased 4.7 Mt. Absent the increase in LNG exports, total emissions would have declined. Australia\u2019s LNG exports for the year to March 2019 are estimated to be worth $47.8bn. While this industry\u2019s success has increased Australia\u2019s emissions, it has potentially reduced global emissions by up to 28% of Australia\u2019s annual emissions by displacing coal generation in importing countries. We are nearly half way towards our 2030 Paris target \u2013 emissions are down 11.7% on 2005 levels and the emissions intensity of the economy and per capita are at their lowest levels in nearly three decades. We are also on track to overachieve on our 2020 target by 367 million tonnes. And this talking note, on the drug-testing trial being extended, is actually a WTF moment: DRUG-TESTING TRIAL The Morrison government\u2019s drug -testing trials are part of our commitment to finding new and innovative ways to breaking down barriers unemployed Australians face and supporting them to get back into the workforce so they can take control of their own lives. The government wants to support unemployed Australians become job-ready and given more than 3.5 million Australians already undergo random drug testing as part of their employment, the drug-testing trial is seeking to ensure people entering Newstart and related payments can take advantage of every job offered to them. This measure is about identifying people with substance abuse issues who need our help and supporting them to seek treatment through a $10m treatment fund. Welfare recipients who test positive will not lose a single cent of their payment but will be placed on Income Management for a period of 24 months which will quarantine 80% of their welfare payment on to the Basics Card which prevents spending on drugs, alcohol and gambling. The remaining 20% will be deposited in their regular account. A second drug test will be scheduled within 25 working days of the positive result. After a second positive test, the job seeker will be referred to a medical professional who will assess their circumstances and identify treatment options which can count towards their mutual obligation activity requirements. The two-year drug-testing trial will be rolled out in three locations \u2013 Logan, Queensland, Canterbury-Bankstown, NSW and Mandurah, WA and will test about 5,000 people entering Newstart. If asked why the government is trying to push through the testing when parliament has rejected it twice: There is clear community support for the trial as reports in the media today further show. The Labor party needs to explain to the Australian people why it wants to deny the government the opportunity to tackle a problem of drug addiction for people who are not in work. We hope that all parties support this legislation and will work respectfully with all parties to ensure the trial can take place and help as many people as possible. If asked about claims there is no evidence it works: Evidence shows drug addiction prevents people from working. The 2016 National Drug Strategy Household Survey (undertaken by Australian Institute of Health and Welfare) shows that unemployed people were 3.1 times more likely to use meth/amphetamines and 1.5 times more likely to use cannabis than the employed. As the PM said: \u201cThis is a trial. We are trying to work out if this can work. I am really puzzled by the level of opposition to the Government trying to tackle a problem of drug addiction for people who are not in work and helping them get over it with referral to proper services and funding those services in those trial areas\u201d. The trial will be subject to a comprehensive evaluation on whether drug testing is an effective way of identifying unemployed Australians whose substance abuse is a barrier to work and supporting those people to undertake treatment. The evaluation will be conducted in parallel with the trial to allow the Government to identify any unintended consequences so these can be addressed in real time. If asked about the trial being likened to a Russian plan to send people who test positive for HIV to an island: It is disappointing to note the fear-mongering around the Government\u2019s proposed drug testing trial which is a genuine attempt to help unemployed Australians overcome substance abuse which is a barrier to work. The Newstart talking points makes my eye twitch a little: No one is saying it\u2019s easy to get by without a job which is why the Morrison government is absolutely focused on helping unemployed Australians be work-ready and creating jobs so working age Australians have the opportunity to gain financial independence. We are delivering results with more than 1.4 million jobs being created since we were elected which is about 240,000 a year compared with just 155,000 on average under Labor. The lowest proportion of working age people on welfare in 30 years is proof that our policies are working. Newstart is a taxpayer funded allowance that provides a taxpayer-funded safety net for people while they look for a job. It is not a salary replacement. It is already increased twice a year, every year in line with CPI which is a widely accepted measure of changes to cost of living. Everyone who receives Newstart allowance is eligible for some form of additional assistance from the welfare system including rent assistance, family tax benefit or the energy supplement on top of the $559 base rate. About two-thirds of those granted Newstart get off the payment within 12 months. The government is focused on breaking down the barriers some Australians face in returning to the workforce which is why we are investing $96m in Try, Test and Learn which is trialling innovative pathways to work for those people at risk of long term welfare dependency. The cashless debit card is financial management tool helping unemployed Australians stabilise their personal circumstances while our proposed drug-testing trial will help identify welfare recipients struggling with substance abuse and provide them with support to get back on track. Welfare cost more than $172bn in 2018-19, representing more than one in three dollars or 35% of all spending by the government. It is the responsibility of government to ensure our social security and welfare system is sustainable into the future, so that it can continue to provide support to those most in need. The Labor party continues to play a cruel joke on Australians claiming to support an increase in the Newstart rate without naming the size of their supposed increase or how they would pay for it. Anthony Albanese wants to outsource decisions on how to spend more than a third of Government spending saying it is a \u201creasonable suggestion\u201d for an independent tribunal to decide the rate of welfare payments. Not only is this irresponsible fiscal policy but it reveals the opposition leader is not ready to lead because governments are elected to make decisions not outsource the tough ones. If asked could you live in $40 a day? No one is saying it would be easy and the government understands some Australians are doing it incredibly tough. Newstart is a safety net, it\u2019s not meant to be a replacement for a salary. The focus of Newstart combined with our government\u2019s additional supports and programs is to help people who find themselves on hard times and to support them to get back into the workforce. Whether it\u2019s work for the dole, youth jobs PaTH or ParentsNext programs, we\u2019re helping Australians get a job so they can earn a wage that creates a better future for themselves and their families. If asked whether an increase to Newstart would stimulate the economy. This government is focused on policies like increasing productivity and moving people from welfare into work. Our policies like record infrastructure investment, tax relief and investment in schools and hospitals are creating the conditions for jobs growth across the economy and delivering services Australians rely on. The government wants you to know that everything is totally fine with Gladys Liu. From the talking points: Ms Liu has spent a considerable amount of time over the last three weeks reviewing her association with all community organisations. With nearly 1000 Chinese organisations alone in Victoria alone it has been a lengthy task. Ms Liu has very clearly stated that she does not wish to be a member of any organisation that has not received her explicit consent. She has asked that she be removed from all organisations that have not received her consent. Ms Liu is confident that she is not linked to any organisations that may have inappropriate associations. Barnaby Joyce, who was last incensed over toilet facilities at Sydney airport, was feeling reflective on his Twitter feed this morning: The tweet before was about how monopoly ownership of Sydney airport was not healthy, with a shot of out-of-order urinals (save yourself and don\u2019t look \u2013 what has been seen can not be unseen). What was left out of the tweet was the Sydney airport was privatised in 2002 \u2013 under the Howard government. As first reported by Rob Harris at Nine Newspapers, Barnaby Joyce is the latest person to speak out on behalf of Julian Assange. This is what Joyce had to say to reporters this morning: I, in no way, shape or form, give a character recommendation about Mr Assange. That\u2019s not the issue. The issue is the sovereignty of the laws. And the law is for those you both like or dislike, or have no opinion on. If a person commits a crime in Australia, then you\u2019ll be judged by Australian law. If a person commits a crime in another country while they\u2019re there, they should be judged by those laws. If a person is residing in Australia and commits a crime in another country, I don\u2019t believe that that is a position for extradition. If they weren\u2019t actually there, if they weren\u2019t present there, that is a question for Australian law. We have to follow the principle, even if we don\u2019t have regard for the person. The first subject (after an election list of \u201cpriorities\u201d was drought. What is most interesting about this one is that it highlights the parts the government knows it is vulnerable on \u2013 no actual national drought policy, issues with the farm household allowance and $5bn of that $7bn repeated total, going to a future fund. SUPPORT FOR DROUGHT-AFFECTED AREAS Farmers and their communities will have access to more support with the Coalition Government announcing it will provide more funding, cut red tape and increase services. This week we announced an extra $13.2 million in support for further on-farm water infrastructure \u2013 more than 2000 farmers have already taken up the chance to improve their water access by building new bores, pipelines and desilting muddy dams and the rebate will now also be made available to farmers with permanent crops like fruit trees and vineyards. The support package we announced last week will deliver nearly $100 million to drought-hit communities, which is on top of more than $7 billion in drought support funding already provided by the Government. As the Prime Minister has said, supporting drought affected communities remains our Government\u2019s most urgent priority. That is why he headed directly to drought affected Queensland after he arrives from the US. We are delivering $33 million to resume the Drought Community Support Initiative, which will deliver up to $3000 to eligible farming households experiencing hardship due to drought. We are providing a $13 million extension to the Drought Community Programme to deliver support at the local government level where it counts. Thirteen more Local Government Areas will be provided up to $1 million for local infrastructure and drought relief products. Those areas have been chosen based on Bureau of Meteorology data about current and future weather conditions. We\u2019re also: Delivering the $5 billion Future Drought Fund to help give our farmers tools to prepare for, manage and sustain their businesses through drought. We\u2019ve also been slashing the complexity of the forms to apply and expanding the eligibility of the program If asked: calls for a national drought policy The federal government has a national drought policy and it was outlined following the national drought summit the Government convened last year It includes more than $7 billion worth of measures from supporting people\u2019s mental health to additional assistance through the Farm Household Allowance, as well as our backing for 21 new water infrastructure projects Our response is strategic, comprehensive and focused on both the short-term immediacy needs of farming families and the longer-term future for agriculture in this country None of these talking points are Watergate. We all know that MPs have talking notes \u2013 how else do you think they all say the same thing, over and over and over again? And there is nothing new in any of them \u2013 we all know the government\u2019s lines on these issues. But it is interesting that the arguments have not shifted, despite the debates having moved on \u2013 the government is still pushing the same points it has been pushing since Scott Morrison came to power. But we have come to expect that too. Everything Morrison doesn\u2019t want to talk about is a \u201cbubble\u201d issue, or something he is \u201cnot getting into\u201d or \u201cI\u2019ve already answered that\u201d and we all know the issues with getting anything out of government departments. This is just more of the same. And on welfare, which is also an issue which is not going away (and nor should it) the government wants its members spreading these messages: Social services touches almost all Australians at some stage in their lives usually when people are at their most vulnerable which is why it is absolutely crucial that the system remains sustainable into the future so that we can continue to provide support to those most in need. In 2018-19 the government spent more than $170bn a year on social security and welfare, representing more than one in three dollars or 35% of all commonwealth spending. That amount equates to about 75% of the total amount paid in personal income tax As such the system it must be targeted, sustainable and in line with the expectations of the taxpayers who fund it. The government\u2019s position on Newstart, and indeed the prime minister\u2019s position, is very clear: The best form of welfare is a job, and the government is absolutely focused on getting people off of welfare and into work. It is a taxpayer funded allowance that provides a safety net for people while they look for a job and is increased twice a year, every year in line with CPI. It is not intended to be a wage replacement. The Morrison government is delivering the job opportunities with more than 1.4 million jobs created since the Coalition was elected. We are also providing pathways to jobs and breaking down barriers unemployed Australians face getting back into the workforce. Newstart allowance is just one element of our comprehensive social security and welfare system which include additional supplements and allowances, concessional access to healthcare, and targeted support through employment services all play a role in supporting people whilst they transition back into the workforce. Jobs growth and supporting jobseekers to fulfil mutual obligations with employment services and through activities designed to improve their job prospects has contributed to the improved lifetime cost of welfare as well as the significant reduction in people entering the welfare system and reduced persistency of payments. The proportion of Australians receiving working-age income support payments has fallen to its lowest level in 30 years at 14.3%t. There are 230,000 fewer working age recipients on income support payments between June 2014 and June 2018. If asked \u2013 2018 Welfare Valuation Report The latest valuation shows a 10.1% reduction in the total future lifetime cost of welfare in Australia down to $5.7tn when compared to the re-based 30 June 2017 estimates, confirming the success of government welfare to work initiatives. Government initiatives have contributed to this improved lifetime cost of welfare including jobs growth and significant reductions in entries onto payments and decreases in persistency to payments. The full 2018 valuation will be released by government in due course. If asked why do the PIA figures differ from those reported in past years: The 2018 Priority Investment Approach uses a 5% discount rate based on advice from the Australian Government Actuary in line with other government estimations. The government has updated the first three years of valuations in line with that decision so we are comparing apples with apples. Changing the Discount Rate from 6% to 5% is not an accounting trick \u2013 it brings the valuation in line with the Budget discount rate and other government publications, demonstrating a realistic and responsible government response to recent economic conditions. Another big issue for the government \u2013 border protection \u2013 was also on its talking notes list. Kristina Keneally was on Insiders on Sunday (here is some of what she had to say) but it\u2019s Labor\u2019s stance on people who overstay their visas who arrive by air that the government is focusing on. Here is the government line on that for this week: PROTECTION CLAIMS BY MIGRANTS WHO ARRIVE BY AIR In the last three years that Labor was in office, 6,900 permanent protection visas were granted by Labor to people who arrived by air. In the last three years under this government, 4,780 visas have been granted \u2013 3% less than under Labor. The government is focusing resources both on and offshore to prevent unmeritorious protection claims. This includes through enhancements to our intelligence systems and operational activity. Less than 0.25% of people who arrive lawfully in Australia apply for protection, and of them the vast majority are refused. And the numbers of those who do apply for protection are declining. In 2018-19, the number of onshore protection claims fell by 12 per cent, a result of the government\u2019s focus on stopping unmeritorious claims. This number is continuing to decline at similar rate this program YTD. People who arrive by air, do so with valid travel and identity documents. We know who they are. They are not putting their lives at risk, or the lives of their children at risk, by getting on a boat. We won\u2019t be taking any advice from Labor, whose mismanagement of our border was an absolute disgrace. Labor\u2019s boat arrivals saw 50,000 people arrive unlawfully, 8,000 children were forcibly placed in detention, 1,200 people lost their lives, 17 detention centres were opened \u2013 all at a cost to the Australian taxpayer of $17bn. If asked about worker exploitation The exploitation of any worker in Australia is something we have zero tolerance for. We take a whole of government, multi-agency approach when it comes to the exploitation of foreign workers \u2013 this includes the Australian federal police, the Australian Border Force, state and territory police, the Australian Taxation Office and the fair work ombudsman. Labor claim to be concerned about worker exploitation, but when they were last in government they decimated the fair work ombudsman\u2019s funding by more than $20m, cut their staff by 23% and had no policy to protect vulnerable workers. We have legislated to increase penalties for worker exploitation by up to tenfold, increased the powers of the fair work ombudsman to enforce the law, and increased their resources by over $50m and 60 new staff. Labor\u2019s border protection policies Abolish temporary protection visas. Abolish the fast-track assessment process for boat arrivals. Increase our permanent refugee intake by 71%t, cost of $6bn. Labor has already, through partnering with the Greens, passed a law that removes the government\u2019s ability to determine who comes to Australia from Manus or Nauru. The leader of the opposition voted to ban boat turn-backs. The shadow immigration minister Andrew Giles moved the motion. Kristina Keneally has previously written in the Guardian to \u201cbring the refugees to Australia\u201d. Labor\u2019s track record on border security is clear. They cannot be trusted. And for why the medevac legislation is considered so important by medical bodies, you only need to return to this story from Katharine Murphy a little earlier this year. The medical review panel is not overturning all of the minister\u2019s decisions. We know that, because they have to report to the parliament. In the June quarterly report, the panel, which is chosen by the government, agreed with the minister\u2019s decision in nine of the 15 cases he rejected. Australian medical facilities have not been overrun. Elective surgeries have not been subjected to widespread cancellations (which was actually a claim put forward at the time) and the boats have not restarted. But people who need it, who are under our care, are getting the treatment doctors tell us they so desperately need. On that bolded point in the last post, these are the actual facts, as reported by Katharine Murphy when the bill was still being discussed. The minister has not lost discretion when it comes to security reasons: What discretion does the responsible minister have? Ministerial discretion applies in three areas. First, the minister can refuse the transfer if he or she disagrees with the clinical assessment. The second grounds for refusal is if the minister reasonably suspects that the transfer of the person to Australia would be prejudicial to security \u201cwithin the meaning of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979, including because an adverse security assessment in respect of the person is in force under that Act\u201d. Sticking with security, the transfer can also be knocked back if Asio advises the minister that transfer of the person to Australia may be prejudicial to security \u201cand that threat cannot be mitigated\u201d. The third grounds for refusal is if the minister knows that the transferee has a substantial criminal record (I\u2019ll give you some definitions on that in a minute) and the minister reasonably believes the person would expose the Australian community to a serious risk of criminal conduct. The decision needs to be made within 72 hours. If the minister denies the transfer request on health grounds (as opposed to security or criminal grounds), then the issue goes to an Independent Health Advice Panel \u201cas soon as practicable\u201d. The panel then conducts a second assessment and reports within 72 hours. If the panel reports the person should be transferred on health grounds, and the other vetoes I\u2019ve mentioned are not in force, then the view of the panel prevails. Here is what the government has to say about the medevac legislation. Which MP, you ask? Oh, any of them. This is what the PMO wants them to say, so expect to see varying examples of this throughout the week. Processes for medical transfer already exist and are effective. Section 198B of the Migration Act allows for a transitory person from a country or place outside Australia to come to Australia for a temporary purpose, for example medical or psychiatric assessment or treatment. There are currently over 1,000 transitory persons in Australia. The repeal of the Miscellaneous Measures Act does not remove the ability to medically transfer a transitory person to Australia. It is important to have a single, consistent, transparent medical transfer process with all the necessary protections for the Commonwealth and individuals in place. It is a misconception that the medical transfer provisions inserted by the Miscellaneous Measures Act introduced \u201cdoctors\u201d into the medical transfer process. It did not. The Department has consistently relied on clinical advice from doctors to form decisions on whether to bring a person to Australia for medical. It is the Government\u2019s position that it should determine who is allowed to enter Australia, and the terms and conditions to be imposed on that entry, as is the right of every sovereign nation* Medical services in Papua New Guinea and Nauru have improved over time to more effectively respond to transferee health needs and requirements. The need for medical transfers to third countries, including Australia, reduced as medical capacity and treatment options became more readily available in Papua New Guinea and Nauru. Welcome to the 20th sitting day of the 46th parliament \u2013 and the third last week of joint sittings for the year. That\u2019s right, we only have three more weeks (or 12 more sitting days) of having both House MPs and the senators in the building at the same time. There is an extra House-only sitting next week, with a Senate-only sitting week next month, but that is it! Before we get there, we have a bunch of things to not talk about. We know that, because the prime minister\u2019s office accidentally emailed the government\u2019s talking notes for the day (the list that goes out to government MPs so they know what line to stick to when questioned on issues) to the media distribution list. I\u2019ll bring you some from that a little later. Josh Frydenberg has announced the ACCC will be looking into mortgage products after the big four banks neglected to pass on the latest interest rate cut from the RBA in full. And Jacqui Lambie, as the swing vote, is facing pressure from all sides over medevac. The government wants it gone. Labor, the Greens and the independents, who worked together to get it passed, want it to stay. In a fairly unprecedented step, the nation\u2019s medical bodies came together in a joint statement at the weekend, asking for it to remain. Lambie says she won\u2019t horse-trade over the legislation but is staying quiet on which way she is leaning. Lambie is taking her time this second go round in the Senate. The parliamentary report into medevac is due to be handed down on 18 October, but the Senate isn\u2019t back until 11 November, so she still has a few weeks to think it over. You\u2019ll have Mike Bowers, Katharine Murphy, Sarah Martin and Paul Karp at your disposal, plus what ever percentage of me can be mustered up once I get my third coffee. Stay in touch with us on the socials, or in the comments. Ready? Let\u2019s get into it.",

      "bodyText": "The Cave of the Golden Calf had such a scandalous reputation that a high society divorce case once cited the mere act of attendance as evidence of dubious character. The doorway to the notorious Mayfair club stood at the top of a steep set of steps and was illuminated by a single electric light bulb. A panel set in the wall showed the titular calf in a state of tumescence, flanked by phalluses hanging limp. Opened in June 1912 by Frida Strindberg \u2013 writer, bohemian and ex-wife of playwright August \u2013 the Cave of the Golden Calf was named after the idol erected by the Israelites at Mount Sinai, and cultivated an appropriately pagan image. The London establishment pronounced itself England\u2019s first and only artistic cabaret and its heady decor was provided by artists of the moment: Spencer Gore, Wyndham Lewis, Jacob Epstein, Charles Ginner. Strindberg\u2019s introduction to London\u2019s creative circles had come via her tempestuous relationship with the painter Augustus John, who memorably referred to her as \u201cthe walking hell-bitch of the western world\u201d. Surrounded by avant-garde decorations, including exotic hunting scenes and a drop cloth painted to resemble raw meat, guests at the Cave were treated to shadow plays, opera, experimental dance, comedy sketches and poetry, which was barely audible above the raucous chatter. The spirit of the Cave, if not its ravishing interiors, lived on in the magnificently indecorous creative gatherings of the latter half of the 20th century, when Thames-side warehouses at Butler\u2019s Wharf were squatted by such artists as Derek Jarman and Andrew Logan. It was there in 1975 that Logan held his Alternative Miss World. Participants in this \u201cpansexual beauty pageant\u201d included Miss St Claire Perry of Essex, better known to current audiences as that shrinking violet of the art world, Grayson Perry. A decade later, performance artist Leigh Bowery co-founded the club night Taboo in a space off Leicester Square. The door policy was notoriously fierce: \u201cDress as though your life depends on it \u2013 or don\u2019t bother.\u201d Bowery did just that, manipulating his figure with extraordinary designs that padded, squashed and transformed him like a living sculpture. His club looks were later exhibited at the Anthony D\u2019Offay Gallery, where Bowery appeared in a series of extreme costumes, watched by visitors through a one-way mirror. Both Bowery and his friend Sue Tilley (cashier at Taboo) became important models for the painter Lucian Freud. The Cave of the Golden Calf, and many equally racy institutions, are celebrated in Into the Night, an exhibition at London\u2019s Barbican exploring clubs, cabarets and bohemian life.

We also know many of its words. We are approaching the moment when the great dictionaries pick those that sum up our times, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/nov/15/toxic-oxford-dictionaries-word-of-2018\" title=\"\">following on from last year\u2019s \u201ctoxic\u201d</a> (Oxford English Dictionary), \u201cjustice\u201d (Merriam Webster) \u201csingle use\u201d (Collins) and \u201cme too\u201d (Macquarie). The words might not have been coined in 2019, but will have acquired new meaning, risen to prominence, or somehow distil our preoccupations. In advance of the lexicographers\u2019 big reveal, here are my top 10 candidates.</p> \n<h2><strong>People</strong></h2> \n<p>A pretty ordinary word \u2013 and one with a long history (its origins are murky once you get past Latin, where populus meant a community or nation). But the way the idea of \u201cthe people\u201d has been used over the past year, often cynically, makes it thoroughly contemporary. Supporters of Brexit constantly invoke the \u201cwill\u201d of the people, likening the nation to an individual with desires and motives. Their opponents agitate for a \u201cpeople\u2019s vote\u201d.

But it is an important part of the creaking apparatus of the British constitution and refers to the act of ending a parliamentary session. It comes from the Latin verb to extend and contains the element rogare (to ask). As it turned out, there wasn\u2019t much asking involved \u2013 Johnson\u2019s government, in the vampiric form of Jacob Rees-Mogg, told the Queen that parliament needed to be suspended and she complied. But, as the supreme court concluded, this instruction was unlawful.

      "bodyText": "The year 2019 might still have some surprises in store for us \u2013 Donald Trump is yet to ask the Queen if she has any dirt on Joe Biden \u2013 but we know the general shape of it: global chaos, lies and Love Island. We also know many of its words. We are approaching the moment when the great dictionaries pick those that sum up our times, following on from last year\u2019s \u201ctoxic\u201d (Oxford English Dictionary), \u201cjustice\u201d (Merriam Webster) \u201csingle use\u201d (Collins) and \u201cme too\u201d (Macquarie). The words might not have been coined in 2019, but will have acquired new meaning, risen to prominence, or somehow distil our preoccupations. In advance of the lexicographers\u2019 big reveal, here are my top 10 candidates. People A pretty ordinary word \u2013 and one with a long history (its origins are murky once you get past Latin, where populus meant a community or nation). But the way the idea of \u201cthe people\u201d has been used over the past year, often cynically, makes it thoroughly contemporary. Supporters of Brexit constantly invoke the \u201cwill\u201d of the people, likening the nation to an individual with desires and motives. Their opponents agitate for a \u201cpeople\u2019s vote\u201d. Trump makes it a proper noun: \u201cI am coming to the conclusion that what is taking place is not an impeachment, it is a COUP, intended to take away the Power of the People.\u201d Back in Britain we nervously await a \u201cpeople versus parliament\u201d election, with Boris Johnson eager to paint MPs who oppose his strategy as anti-democrats at odds with the popular mood. Prorogue Like one of the aged vellum documents stowed in parliament\u2019s Victoria tower, this word was unfurled in August to widespread incomprehension. But it is an important part of the creaking apparatus of the British constitution and refers to the act of ending a parliamentary session. It comes from the Latin verb to extend and contains the element rogare (to ask). As it turned out, there wasn\u2019t much asking involved \u2013 Johnson\u2019s government, in the vampiric form of Jacob Rees-Mogg, told the Queen that parliament needed to be suspended and she complied. But, as the supreme court concluded, this instruction was unlawful. As MPs re-entered the chamber on 25 September, the only trace of the prorogation was the imprint of its lugubrious syllables in our minds. Femtech Startup culture hasn\u2019t always seemed like the most welcoming place for women, so the idea of femtech might seem like a breath of fresh air. Investment in digital technology designed to improve women\u2019s health and wellbeing \u2013 like Bluetooth enabled pelvic-floor training devices or fertility apps \u2013 has been steadily building. In the first quarter of 2019, $241m (\u00a3190m) was ploughed into femtech companies, leading some to predict the sector\u2019s first billion-dollar year. But the term isn\u2019t without controversy. \u201cWhen it\u2019s about men and men\u2019s health, it\u2019s not mentech, right?\u201d one analyst recently told the BBC. \u201cWelcome to the world of 21st-century technological advancements, where brand new innovations give us the chance to \u2026 create exactly the same stupid sexist divides all over again,\u201d wrote Quartz\u2019s Olivia Goldhill. It\u2019s a good question: why are products aimed at half the population deemed niche? Sadfishing One of those rare words whose origin can be precisely pinpointed to an opinion piece \u2013 in Metro in January. \u201cSadfishing,\u201d wrote Rebecca Reid, \u201cis when someone uses their emotional problems to hook an audience on the internet\u201d.

      "body": "<p>After a 3-0 start to the season, the Dallas Cowboys stumbled in their next two games with losses to the New Orleans Saints and the Green Bay Packers. Yet there was no reason to overreact. After all, their opponents on Sunday were going to be the 0-4 New York Jets and starting quarterback Sam Darnold fresh off a <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/sam-darnold-to-wear-specialized-pads-to-protect-spleen-in-first-game-back-from-mono/\">month-long bout with mononucleosis</a>.

Even before the start of Sunday\u2019s game, there were factors working against the Cowboys. They began without <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/blog/nfceast/post/_/id/83926/banged-up-cowboys-fall-to-winless-jets-lose-third-straight\">many of their key players</a>, most notably tackles Tyron Smith and La\u2019el Collins and receiver Randall Cobb. During the game itself, quarterback Dak Prescott lost one of his most reliable weapons when wide receiver Amari Cooper exited the game with a quad injury. The Cowboys were playing at some disadvantage and on the road.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/13/nfl-scores-roundup-week-six\">NFL: Sam Darnold pilots Jets to upset of Cowboys while 49ers stay undefeated</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Still, no one could have expected that halftime score. The Jets were not just ahead but they were ahead 21-6. Darnold, wearing protective gear to protect his possibly enlarged spleen, had thrown for two touchdowns and Le\u2019Veon Bell had rushed for a third. Meanwhile, the only offense the Cowboys were able to muster came courtesy of kicker Brett Maher. Not only were the Cowboys losing, they were on the verge of being blown out.</p> <p>In the second half, however, the Jets looked more like the team that couldn\u2019t sniff a win in their first four attempts. After the break, New York were only able to add a field goal to their total while Ezekiel Elliott was able to rush for a touchdown to make it a one-score game. At this point, it felt like both the Cowboys and the Jets were working toward an outcome where somehow could both lose.</p> <p>Perhaps it was fitting such a bizarre game would end with a comedy of errors. During the final minutes, officials called penalties on <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/sports/new-york-jets-dallas-cowboys-six-straight-penalties-flags-dak-prescott-ezekiel-elliott-234653211.html\">six straight plays</a>, something which helped keep the Cowboys chances alive long enough for them to score a touchdown to pull within 24-22. To the Cowboys\u2019 credit, they\u2019f worked their way back from a 15-point deficit to a place where they could have forced overtime with a successful two-point conversion. To their detriment, they couldn\u2019t pull it off. The Jets held on for their first win of the season as the skidding Cowboys fell to .500.</p> <p>Dallas opened the season tagged as <a href=\"https://cowboyswire.usatoday.com/2019/06/02/dallas-cowboys-new-england-patriots-biggest-threats-2019-super-bowl/\">potential Super Bowl contenders</a> and after their fast start, the hype seemed legitimate. There\u2019s no shame in being beaten by the likes of the Saints or the Packers, even if back-to-back losses are not exactly ideal for a team with championship aspirations. Now that they have lost a third straight game, this time in listless and depressing fashion to a winless team starting a quarterback recovering from a significant illness ... well, now it\u2019s panic time, no matter what the team\u2019s injury situation happened to be.</p> <p>Cowboys fans who are now openly questioning whether the team needs to part ways with head coach Jason Garrett if they want to save the season. It\u2019s not a random coincidence that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NFL_Memes/status/1183528357981511681\">a clip</a> of Garrett\u2019s players refusing to high-five him during the last few minutes of the fourth quarter immediately went viral after the loss. Owner <a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000001065562/article/jerry-jones-cowboys-are-not-one-of-nfls-top-teams\">Jerry Jones responded</a> to the debacle by making the inarguable declaration that Dallas was not one of the NFL\u2019s \u201ctop teams\u201d.</p> <p>What about the legion of Cowboys haters? Well, they have a week to enjoy some good old fashioned schadenfreude. For them, the only thing that would have made this loss funnier would be if it had happened on Jones\u2019s birthday. <a href=\"https://www.star-telegram.com/sports/nfl/dallas-cowboys/article236092368.html\">Which it totally did</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Stat of the week</strong></h2> <p><strong>Six</strong>. That\u2019s the number of turnovers committed by quarterback Jameis Winston in the Tampa Bay Buccaneers\u2019 37-26 loss to the Carolina Panthers in Sunday\u2019s London game. Winston began his day by throwing his first interception and, fittingly enough, ended it with his fifth. In between, he also lost a fumble after a strip sack. Winston\u2019s six turnovers <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ESPNStatsInfo/status/1183429549574496258\">were the most</a> committed by a player since Ryan Fitzpatrick, then with the New York Jets, threw six interceptions against the Kansas City Chiefs back in 2013. Winston has struggled with taking care of the ball since the Buccaneers took him with the first overall pick in 2015 and his lack of development in that area might force Tampa Bay to move on.</p> <h2><strong>MVP of the week</strong></h2> <p><strong>Stefon Diggs, WR, Vikings.</strong> Minnesota improved to 4-2 after routing the Philadelphia Eagles 38-20. A huge reason was that Diggs ended up scoring three touchdowns, picking up 167 yards on seven receptions. To be fair, he couldn\u2019t have piled up these numbers if journeyman quarterback Kirk Cousins wasn\u2019t playing on a high level as well. Cousins went 22-for-29, accumulating 333 passing yards and an additional touchdown pss to Adam Thielen. At this point in the season, the Vikings very much look like they will be challenging the Green Bay Packers for the NFC North title.</p> <h2><strong>Quote of the week</strong></h2> <p>\u201cToday we give thanks to the Lord for our new #Saints.

Thanks to this quirk, it looked for all the world like the pope was suggesting that God would be favoring New Orleans over the Jacksonville Jaguars in their game on Sunday, when the tweet <a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/did-pope-francis-announce-his-saints-fandom-on-twitter-161042654.html\">was actually referring to</a> the canonization of five new saints by the Catholic Church. While it\u2019s not for us to say whether that had anything to do with the Saints beating the Jaguars later that afternoon, it would be blasphemous to say that it could have hurt.</p> <h2><strong>Video of the week</strong></h2> <p>The Seattle Seahawks\u2019 32-28 win over the still-struggling Cleveland Browns gave us what could end up being the best endzone celebration of the season.

      "bodyText": "After a 3-0 start to the season, the Dallas Cowboys stumbled in their next two games with losses to the New Orleans Saints and the Green Bay Packers. Yet there was no reason to overreact. After all, their opponents on Sunday were going to be the 0-4 New York Jets and starting quarterback Sam Darnold fresh off a month-long bout with mononucleosis. This would be the perfect chance for Dallas to get back into the win column, right? Well, as it turns out, not necessarily. Even before the start of Sunday\u2019s game, there were factors working against the Cowboys. They began without many of their key players, most notably tackles Tyron Smith and La\u2019el Collins and receiver Randall Cobb. During the game itself, quarterback Dak Prescott lost one of his most reliable weapons when wide receiver Amari Cooper exited the game with a quad injury. The Cowboys were playing at some disadvantage and on the road. Still, no one could have expected that halftime score. The Jets were not just ahead but they were ahead 21-6. Darnold, wearing protective gear to protect his possibly enlarged spleen, had thrown for two touchdowns and Le\u2019Veon Bell had rushed for a third. Meanwhile, the only offense the Cowboys were able to muster came courtesy of kicker Brett Maher. Not only were the Cowboys losing, they were on the verge of being blown out. In the second half, however, the Jets looked more like the team that couldn\u2019t sniff a win in their first four attempts. After the break, New York were only able to add a field goal to their total while Ezekiel Elliott was able to rush for a touchdown to make it a one-score game. At this point, it felt like both the Cowboys and the Jets were working toward an outcome where somehow could both lose. Perhaps it was fitting such a bizarre game would end with a comedy of errors. During the final minutes, officials called penalties on six straight plays, something which helped keep the Cowboys chances alive long enough for them to score a touchdown to pull within 24-22. To the Cowboys\u2019 credit, they\u2019f worked their way back from a 15-point deficit to a place where they could have forced overtime with a successful two-point conversion. To their detriment, they couldn\u2019t pull it off. The Jets held on for their first win of the season as the skidding Cowboys fell to .500. Dallas opened the season tagged as potential Super Bowl contenders and after their fast start, the hype seemed legitimate. There\u2019s no shame in being beaten by the likes of the Saints or the Packers, even if back-to-back losses are not exactly ideal for a team with championship aspirations. Now that they have lost a third straight game, this time in listless and depressing fashion to a winless team starting a quarterback recovering from a significant illness ... well, now it\u2019s panic time, no matter what the team\u2019s injury situation happened to be. Cowboys fans who are now openly questioning whether the team needs to part ways with head coach Jason Garrett if they want to save the season. It\u2019s not a random coincidence that a clip of Garrett\u2019s players refusing to high-five him during the last few minutes of the fourth quarter immediately went viral after the loss. Owner Jerry Jones responded to the debacle by making the inarguable declaration that Dallas was not one of the NFL\u2019s \u201ctop teams\u201d. What about the legion of Cowboys haters? Well, they have a week to enjoy some good old fashioned schadenfreude. For them, the only thing that would have made this loss funnier would be if it had happened on Jones\u2019s birthday. Which it totally did. Stat of the week Six. That\u2019s the number of turnovers committed by quarterback Jameis Winston in the Tampa Bay Buccaneers\u2019 37-26 loss to the Carolina Panthers in Sunday\u2019s London game.

Winston has struggled with taking care of the ball since the Buccaneers took him with the first overall pick in 2015 and his lack of development in that area might force Tampa Bay to move on.

In parliament on Monday, Labor asked a series of questions to the prime minister about whether he or his office sought to have the senior pastor on the guest list for the White House, where Donald Trump hosted a state dinner for Morrison last month. Labor\u2019s deputy leader, Richard Marles, referred to the Wall Street Journal report that said Morrison had been \u201cdetermined\u201d to bring Houston to the White House, with several rounds of discussions between Canberra and Washington before the idea was vetoed. \u201cWhy won\u2019t the prime minister give a straight answer to this question: did the prime minister or his office seek to have Brian Houston invited to the White House?,\u201d Marles said. After initially refusing to comment on the story, deriding it as \u201cgossip\u201d, Morrison told parliament the invitations were handled by the White House, and it was \u201ca matter for the White House\u201d. \u201cI think the Australian people are more interested in who Jamie Clements was inviting to dinner, and how much cash was in the wine bag,\u201d Morrison said, in reference to revelations about illegal Chinese donations made to the NSW branch of the Labor party. After the question was repeatedly asked, Morrison criticised the Labor party for \u201ccasting aspersions\u201d on Houston. \u201cIf they are suggesting anything serious, or casting any aspersions on the individual which is the subject of the question, then perhaps I suggest they go and attend that church and they explain their concerns directly to their parishioners,\u201d Morrison said. The Wall Street Journal reported that Morrison had requested the senior Hillsong church pastor be invited to the state dinner at the Rose Garden in the White House, but the request was knocked back. According to the findings of the 2014 royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse, Houston failed to alert police about allegations that his father, Frank, had sexually assaulted children. The commissioner found multiple failings in the response of the church executive \u2013 at the time led by Brian.

Education minister Chris Hipkins said on Monday: \u201cThe recent death at a student hall of residence in Christchurch exposed the limitations of our current system. \u201cHalls and hostels charge a premium for their accommodation and parents have every right to expect a high level of care for their sons and daughters \u2026 students should also be assured that there are minimum standards of safety and that there is support available to them if they need it.\u201d The government will change the Education Act to introduce a mandatory code of practice for pastoral care. Serious breaches of the new mandatory code, including major injury of death, will result in fines of up to NZ$100,000. The swift changes come after the body of 19-year-old e-commerce student Pendrous was found on 23 September in his dorm room at Canterbury university, Christchurch. Pendrous had been dead for at least a month, New Zealand police said, and his father has expressed anguish that his son\u2019s absence was not noted from university classes, tutorials or meals. It is still unclear how Pendrous died, and the coroner is investigating. First-year university students usually live in campus accomodation, often away from home for the first time. Most halls of residence charge between NZ$15,000 and NZ$20,000 per year. At present, the code of practice is voluntary for university halls of residence, but Hipkins said the self-regulation approach had failed. \u201cThere is no consistent approach to the welfare and pastoral care of domestic tertiary students and we needed to change that swiftly,\u201d he said. The new code of practice will come into effect in 2021, while the new offence and financial penalties will apply from January next year. Earlier this month an Otago University student died when she was trampled to death while attending an end-of semester party in Dunedin. A number of other students were seriously injured, and student binge-drinking culture has been raised as a contributing factor to the tragedy.",

Now I know everyone thinks their house is worth more than it is, but we were actually being quite conservative in our estimates even though a comparable property in our development recently sold for \u00a385,000 more than our valuation. I rang the surveyor and argued my case, he then re-sent his report and overnight the valuation had increased by \u00a315,000. However, this is still significantly less than we had hoped. Is there anything that we can reasonably do regarding this or do we just accept it get moving? The housing association has one week left to find a buyer for our share then we can put it on the open market.

The price you sell for can\u2019t be higher or lower. The buyer must also meet the set eligibility criteria for the shared ownership scheme. So, when selling your share in property, the fact that housing providers typically get eight weeks (sometimes 12) to find a buyer works in your favour since \u2013 unlike an estate agent \u2013 they will have sometimes thousands of potential \u2013 and eligible \u2013 shared-ownership buyers on their books waiting for a suitable property to come up. So the likelihood of the housing provider finding you a buyer is pretty high. In the case of Peabody \u2013 which is one of the largest housing providers in London and the south-east \u2013 it reports finding a buyer within the eight-week period in 98.8% of cases.

It also means that the buyer doesn\u2019t have to pass the shared-ownership eligibility test. But you also have the option to sell 100% of your property even if you currently own only a share of it. According to national shared-ownership property portal <a href=\"http://www.sharetobuy.com\">Share to Buy</a>, if your housing provider hasn\u2019t found you a buyer in the time allowed, you can sell the whole property using a process known as \u201cback-to-back\u201d or \u201csimultaneous\u201d staircasing. This involves increasing your share to 100% on the same day as the sale goes though. You don\u2019t have to borrow extra to pay for your extra share because the funds from the buyer do that (which is why it has to happen on the same day). The bonus in your case is that you would be allowed to accept offers of more \u2013 but not less \u2013 than your valuation amount. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Neil Punchard thought it was funny. The Queensland senior constable used a police database to obtain the personal details of a domestic abuse victim and then joked when he sent her address to her violent former husband. \u201cJust tell her you know where she lives and leave it at that. Lol,\u201d Punchard said in a 2014 text message to his childhood friend, who would later threaten to kill his former wife and strap bombs to their children. On Monday, more than five years after sending that message, Neil Glen Punchard pleaded guilty to nine counts of computer hacking. The Brisbane magistrates court heard Punchard illegally accessed two separate computer systems in 2013 and 2014 as he \u201cbecame more and more embroiled\u201d in his friend\u2019s acrimonious separation. Punchard was sentenced to two months in prison, wholly suspended, on Monday. His penalty is believed to be the first jail term handed out for illegal use of police databases, which has been described as a \u201csystemic problem\u201d in Queensland. The victim, Julie*, says the police must now terminate his employment \u201cTo find out that a police officer was plotting with an abuser behind closed doors is a sense of betrayal that is difficult to articulate,\u201d Julie* told Guardian Australia. In 2016, police declined to bring criminal charges against Punchard. They eventually reopened an investigation last year after consistent public pressure from Julie, whose interactions with police became increasingly embarrassing for the service and the former commissioner, Ian Stewart. Julie has become consumed by fear; heightened because police were supposed to protect her, but instead repeatedly treated her in ways that made her feel \u201cbullied\u201d and unprotected. \u201cI cannot comprehend how a person in such a trusted job could do such a horrible thing and think it would be without consequence,\u201d Julie said. \u201cI live in fear every day. I never go anywhere alone because of fear. I lock the car doors as soon as I get into the car. I cannot trust new people. I am unable to make new friends or know which police officers to trust again. No matter what I do, I cannot feel safe. \u201cI thought that if I was brave enough to come forward and speak up, that the strength of the law would remove such a threat immediately. It has not. \u201cI had no choice left but to stir a hornet\u2019s nest by going to the media with my story. If it were not for the ongoing support of total strangers responding to stories in the media and sending me the strength to carry on in the face of immense adversity and an enormous power imbalance, I am not sure how I could have stood up against the degree of maliciousness that I have endured during this process. \u201cI will forever feel that I have an invisible enemy lurking.\u201d In 2016 Julie discovered the text messages sent by Punchard on a phone that had been used by her former husband and returned to her. Crown prosecutor Angus Edwards said those messages had \u201cinflamed the situation\u201d, including \u201cvery very unedifying\u201d and derogatory comments. \u201cJust tell her you know [the address] now via freedom of information,\u201d Punchard wrote. \u201cShe will be pissed \u2026 Even better just tell her you know where she lives and leave it at that. Lol. She will flip. \u201cI await the email and her reply. Lol. She will fucking explode. Lmao.\u201d In another set of messages, the senior constable offered to assist the man with any police complaints. \u201cThe police will contact you if they want to speak to you \u2026 then you give them my name. That is your get-out-of-jail-free card,\u201d Punchard wrote. \u201cI have completed an email draft to send to the bitch that will hopefully make her shit herself, so I want to go over it with you before I send it to you,\u201d he said in another message. Punchard was first interviewed during a workplace discipline investigation in 2016 and during the process he \u201cmade admissions\u201d, the court heard. Police officers do not have a right against self-incrimination in such circumstances, and the information is considered \u201ccompelled\u201d and not admissible in a criminal court. Police then made the decision \u2013 described later by prosecutors as \u201cerroneous\u201d \u2013 not to lay criminal charges, despite having copies of the text messages and records of the illegal database searches. Punchard was disciplined and went back to work. Astonished the officer was not sacked or charged, Julie and Renee Eaves, a justice advocate whose personal details were accessed from the police system 1,400 times by 400 officers, began a public campaign for charges to be laid. Eaves gatecrashed a press conference by the former police commissioner, Ian Stewart, who was eventually put under pressure to meet Julie and tasked an investigator to review the case. In court, Punchard attempted to argue that his confession in his disciplinary interview had been compelled and had \u201cinfected\u201d the process, that the charges had been brought as a result of that admission, and that his rights had been trampled. After his application to have the charges thrown out failed, Punchard pleaded guilty. Edwards said Punchard\u2019s actions were \u201ca complete breach of trust\u201d. \u201cHis job ... is to protect the Queensland community and he did the complete opposite of that.\u201d Punchard\u2019s lawyer, Calvin Gnech, said the police officer \u201caccepts this is a breach of trust [and that] this is a very serious matter\u201d. But Gnech asked for Punchard to be spared a conviction and said his client had no knowledge of any domestic violence offences at the time he disclosed Julie\u2019s address. Punchard might face renewed disciplinary action from the Queensland Police Service because of the criminal conviction. It is unclear yet if he will be sacked. He remains employed but has been stood down from active duty since being charged. For Julie, the conviction is a vindication of her efforts, but provides little comfort. She has been forced to move home twice and continues to be frustrated by long and unexplained delays in the Queensland civil and administrative tribunal, where police are attempting to appeal against a finding that they breached her privacy. She has received no compensation. Julie said after the hearing she was grateful Punchard received a conviction and jail term. \u201cI\u2019m relieved (and) it does send an important message that this kind of betrayal of trust of the community is not OK. I now understand why so many innocent women and children are dying of domestic violence in this country because it\u2019s not taken seriously enough.\u201d *Name has been changed",

These are three lessons that will stay with me.</p> <h2>Give people a name</h2> <p>She was a talkback caller. Her son had died. The details have faded but I remember her trembling voice, her brave attempt to stay on the call mixed with the terror that she would lose her composure on air. Her voice kept cracking with the weight of sadness and the conversation wasn\u2019t going anywhere. Stuck in traffic and transfixed by the drama, I pretended to be the host.</p> <p>Should I feel sympathetic but tell her to call another day? Should I remain quiet or rush in to fill the awkward silence before my listeners got upset? My hairs rose as I wrestled with the choices. And then, something remarkable happened. Faine said, \u201cLet\u2019s give your son a name. What was his name?\u201d It was magic, this instant creation of a safe space. Once she spoke her son\u2019s name, she could talk about him, share his memory and importantly, get her message across and feel better for it.</p> <p>Every week, I meet patients who are introduced by their diagnosis or their bed number. The 70-year old with gastric cancer. The octogenarian with pneumonia. Bed 10 is dying. Bed 30 has a suspicious breast lump. As if this isn\u2019t bad enough, we never know the names of their loved ones. In a multicultural country, foreign names (like mine) can be hard to pronounce so we stop trying.</p> <p>Dale Carnegie once said that a person\u2019s name, to that person, is the sweetest sound in any language. This is why on every ward round, trying to create a safe space, I balk at using bed numbers as a substitute for names. I say to my residents, \u201cThey have a name, let\u2019s use it.\u201d Even the patients who seem too frail and too groggy respond to their name. Names humanise us \u2013 I learned this from radio.</p> <h2>Now and then, it\u2019s OK to show emotion</h2> <p>In 2012, Melbourne witnessed the ghastly murder of a loved young woman who worked at the ABC. In announcing the news, <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2012/09/28/3599633.htm\">Jon Faine cried on air</a>.</p> <p>It was an utterly human reaction. In fact, given the awful circumstances, how could there have been another? I choked as I drove to work but I learned that sometimes, reacting with the emotion you feel is not just normal, it is also the right thing to do.</p> <p>Last year, I walked into the room of a refugee patient who had put all her trust in me to care for her. But thanks to her poor command of English, a long weekend and stretched staff, she did not die peacefully. In the last minutes of her life, she clutched my hand in despair. Unable to think of anything remotely resembling words of comfort, I simply sat with her husband and cried. A nurse did the same. Our tears held the truest form of expression.</p> <p>For all the challenges that clinicians confront, it\u2019s quite amazing that we mostly hold it together, but I have discovered that our patients don\u2019t mind occasionally seeing us upset. It is a sign that we are bound together by human frailties and emotions and it might build more trust than reciting the latest paper.</p> <h2>Give advice. But never too freely</h2> <p>When I started appearing on air, a doctor cast doubt that I\u2019d ever become a proper oncologist. Not just disheartened but shaken by this dire prediction, I asked Jon Faine for advice. He replied that public radio was a means of democratising medicine and reaching people before they became patients. If I believed this, I\u2019d work out the rest. On our many subsequent on-air appearances, he never dispensed tips, instead letting me find my own voice. He quietly backed me until I felt ready to back myself \u2013 in retrospect there was no richer advice.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/26/the-twin-blessings-of-universal-health-and-education-have-shaped-who-i-am\">The twin blessings of universal health and education have shaped who I am | Ranjana Srivastava</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Like many senior doctors, I am frequently approached by students and trainees. They want to know which specialty to pick, how to write a book, when to report bullying, whether or not to have a baby, and what to say at an interview. The answers aren\u2019t easy, and it can be tempting to expound. One might also regard imitation as the sincerest form of flattery, but I have learned that the best advice can take the form of the fewest words. In seeking advice, people are often looking for hope and encouragement.</p> <p>When I migrated to Australia, I thought there could be no greater privilege than studying medicine. Twenty years later, as I walked into a radio studio I rejoiced that there could be no other greater privilege than using my taxpayer-funded education on public radio. It\u2019s hard to ignore <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/26/the-twin-blessings-of-universal-health-and-education-have-shaped-who-i-am\">the outsized role of public institutions in our lives</a>.</p> <p>Jon Faine will be missed but I sincerely hope his traditions continue, chief among them his unforgettable ability to welcome on-air and support off-air diverse people with differing opinions who might just have something to teach us all.</p> <ul> <li><p>Ranjana Srivastava is an Australian oncologist, award-winning author and Fulbright scholar</p></li> </ul>",

Dale Carnegie once said that a person\u2019s name, to that person, is the sweetest sound in any language. This is why on every ward round, trying to create a safe space, I balk at using bed numbers as a substitute for names. I say to my residents, \u201cThey have a name, let\u2019s use it.\u201d Even the patients who seem too frail and too groggy respond to their name. Names humanise us \u2013 I learned this from radio. Now and then, it\u2019s OK to show emotion In 2012, Melbourne witnessed the ghastly murder of a loved young woman who worked at the ABC. In announcing the news, Jon Faine cried on air. It was an utterly human reaction. In fact, given the awful circumstances, how could there have been another? I choked as I drove to work but I learned that sometimes, reacting with the emotion you feel is not just normal, it is also the right thing to do. Last year, I walked into the room of a refugee patient who had put all her trust in me to care for her. But thanks to her poor command of English, a long weekend and stretched staff, she did not die peacefully. In the last minutes of her life, she clutched my hand in despair. Unable to think of anything remotely resembling words of comfort, I simply sat with her husband and cried. A nurse did the same. Our tears held the truest form of expression. For all the challenges that clinicians confront, it\u2019s quite amazing that we mostly hold it together, but I have discovered that our patients don\u2019t mind occasionally seeing us upset. It is a sign that we are bound together by human frailties and emotions and it might build more trust than reciting the latest paper. Give advice. But never too freely When I started appearing on air, a doctor cast doubt that I\u2019d ever become a proper oncologist. Not just disheartened but shaken by this dire prediction, I asked Jon Faine for advice. He replied that public radio was a means of democratising medicine and reaching people before they became patients. If I believed this, I\u2019d work out the rest. On our many subsequent on-air appearances, he never dispensed tips, instead letting me find my own voice. He quietly backed me until I felt ready to back myself \u2013 in retrospect there was no richer advice. Like many senior doctors, I am frequently approached by students and trainees. They want to know which specialty to pick, how to write a book, when to report bullying, whether or not to have a baby, and what to say at an interview. The answers aren\u2019t easy, and it can be tempting to expound. One might also regard imitation as the sincerest form of flattery, but I have learned that the best advice can take the form of the fewest words. In seeking advice, people are often looking for hope and encouragement. When I migrated to Australia, I thought there could be no greater privilege than studying medicine. Twenty years later, as I walked into a radio studio I rejoiced that there could be no other greater privilege than using my taxpayer-funded education on public radio. It\u2019s hard to ignore the outsized role of public institutions in our lives. Jon Faine will be missed but I sincerely hope his traditions continue, chief among them his unforgettable ability to welcome on-air and support off-air diverse people with differing opinions who might just have something to teach us all.

The analysis, undertaken by Richard Heede at the <a href=\"http://climateaccountability.org/\">Climate Accountability Institute</a>,&nbsp;calculates how much carbon is emitted throughout the supply chain, from extraction to use by consumers. Heede said: \"The fact that consumers combust the fuels to carbon dioxide, water, heat and pollutants does not absolve the fossil fuel companies from responsibility for knowingly perpetuating the carbon era and accelerating the climate crisis toward the existential threat it has now become.\"</p>\n    <p>One aim of the project is to move the focus of debate from individual responsibilities to power structures \u2013 so our reporters also examined the financial and lobbying structures that let fossil fuel firms keep growing, and discovered which elected politicians were voting for change.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Another aim of the project is to press governments and corporations to close the gap between ambitious long-term promises and lacklustre short-term action. The UN says the coming decade is crucial if the world is to avoid the most catastrophic consequences of global heating.

A Greenpeace team took samples from the open-air waste pits on Loma Campana and released the results to the Mapuche Confederation of Neuqu\u00e9n, which last October opened a lawsuit against the Treater waste disposal plant, alleging that Treater had handled waste for many of the fossil fuel companies mining in the area.<br></p> \n<p>\u201cWe are concerned about leakage from the waste pits into the ground as well as by the wind carrying volatile particles into the air from the mountains of waste above the pools,\u201d says Natalia Machain, executive director of Greenpeace Argentina, which joined the lawsuit as plaintiff this year.</p> \n<p>Treater has denied any contamination. \u201cWe are not a waste dump. We are an environmental services company that treats waste from the oil industry.\u201d</p> \n<p>But the Neuqu\u00e9n legislator Santiago Nogueira is pressing for waste management laws because, he says, \u201cthe province does not have enough capacity to process the amount of waste generated by Vaca Muerta\u201d.</p> \n<p>Treater is only one of many open-air waste pits dotted across Vaca Muerta. A large mound rises above the Comarsa waste plant about 4 miles (6km) outside Neuqu\u00e9n.

Experts say the government\u2019s expectations are hampered by the high cost of fracking in Argentina and the lack of adequate gas transport and waste disposal infrastructure, aggravated by a shaky economy.</p> \n<p>The country has spent billions of dollars in direct handouts to lure<br>investors. \u201cOil companies aren\u2019t extracting hydrocarbons from Vaca Muerta. They\u2019re <a href=\"https://farn.org.ar/archives/25350\">extracting subsidies</a>,\u201d says Enrique Viale, an environmental lawyer and anti-fracking campaigner.</p> \n<p>The subsidies are ultimately unaffordable for Argentina, according to a <a href=\"http://ieefa.org/ieefa-report-argentinas-vaca-muerta-patagonia-fracking-plan-is-financially-risky-fiscally-perilous/\">report</a> released in March by the Cleveland-based Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.</p> \n<p>In January the International Monetary Fund, which had put together a $57bn bailout for Argentina in 2018, demanded a trimming of the subsidies. The industry responded with layoffs, the threat of lawsuits against the government and production cuts. \u201cThe abrupt reduction in Argentina\u2019s production subsidy programme \u2026 is shaking investor confidence,\u201d the report states.</p> \n<p>However grim the outlook for the oil and gas companies, it is the Mapuche indigenous people who are bearing the highest cost for Argentina\u2019s dream of a fracking bonanza.</p> \n<p>\u201cAs Mapuches, we\u2019re not fighting for just ourselves or our community,\u201d says Albino Campo Maripe. \u201cWe want our children and grandchildren to know that we fought for something that belongs to everyone.

When he was a child, the 60-year-old Mapuche chief used to ride there bareback. Those days are gone for ever. The once-pristine landscape is now dotted with fracking wells and the white patches of land cleared for even more. The panoramic view is nonetheless overpowering. Two crystal-blue lakes, whose far shores blend with the horizon, cling to the edge of an arid and wind-buffeted Martian landscape of red sandstone, rugged promontories and wide beaches. The ancient and spectacular rock formations of Neuqu\u00e9n province in Argentina\u2019s Patagonia region are a paleontologist\u2019s dream, rich with dinosaur fossils. But the image quickly fades to the sight and sound of the fracking well that exploded on 14 September and burned continuously for 24 days, spewing hot gas and other elements into the air from nearly two miles below ground. The raging fire was finally put out on Monday by a team of experts who flew from Houston with 56 tons of special equipment. \u201cThis shouldn\u2019t be happening,\u201d Campo Maripe said, \u201cbut these are the consequences of fracking.\u201d Fracking accidents happen regularly in Vaca Muerta (Dead Cow in Spanish), one of the world\u2019s largest shale oil and gas reservoirs. In 2018 alone, there were an estimated 934 incidents at 95 wells. There have been leaks from drilling sites, and claims from local people of water pollution and increased ill health affecting them and their livestock. For Argentina\u2019s leaders there is a bigger picture. They believe the shale reservoir can rescue the country from its ongoing economic crises. \u201cThis province will transform us into a world power,\u201d the president, Mauricio Macri, said on Tuesday to a crowd of 3,000 people in Neuqu\u00e9n, referring to the nearly 2,000 fracking wells that have been drilled there since the discovery of the deposits was announced in 2011. Twenty companies own a total of 36 concessions in Vaca Muerta, covering a combined area of about 8,500 sq km (3,300 sq miles). The Argentine oil company YPF leads the pack with 23 areas, of which 16 are operational, in partnership with the US firm Chevron. For the environmentalist Maristella Svampa, the promise that Vaca Muerta could turn Argentina into a new Saudi Arabia is a myth, like that of El Dorado, the city of gold the Spanish conquistadors searched for in South America. \u201cIt\u2019s the magical illusion of sudden wealth,\u201d she said. Neuqu\u00e9n\u2019s indigenous Mapuche people claim Vaca Muerta has brought them not wealth, but discrimination, dispossession and health problems. The Campo Maripe community, comprising about 125 people among 35 families, is one of more than 40 Mapuche communities in Neuqu\u00e9n. \u201cWhen we went to school the other students would yell: \u2018Here come the Indians,\u2019\u201d says Mabel Campo Maripe, 52, who shares community chief duties with her brother Albino. \u201cThose same people today refuse to accept we are Mapuches because that would give us a right to our land.\u201d They say the denial of their cultural identity is being used by the Neuqu\u00e9n authorities to refuse the Campo Maripe community legal rights over the Loma Campana plateau, where they say they have grazed their cattle and goats for nearly a century.

Operational excellence is key and we work permanently to improve and implement solutions that minimise the potential impacts that our activity could generate,\u201d it said. \u201cIn the special case of Loma Campana, the area we develop in partnership with Chevron, no incidents of any kind have been recorded since the beginning of operations in 2013.\u201d The arrival of waste disposal contractors has brought a separate set of problems. A Greenpeace team took samples from the open-air waste pits on Loma Campana and released the results to the Mapuche Confederation of Neuqu\u00e9n, which last October opened a lawsuit against the Treater waste disposal plant, alleging that Treater had handled waste for many of the fossil fuel companies mining in the area. \u201cWe are concerned about leakage from the waste pits into the ground as well as by the wind carrying volatile particles into the air from the mountains of waste above the pools,\u201d says Natalia Machain, executive director of Greenpeace Argentina, which joined the lawsuit as plaintiff this year. Treater has denied any contamination. \u201cWe are not a waste dump. We are an environmental services company that treats waste from the oil industry.\u201d But the Neuqu\u00e9n legislator Santiago Nogueira is pressing for waste management laws because, he says, \u201cthe province does not have enough capacity to process the amount of waste generated by Vaca Muerta\u201d. Treater is only one of many open-air waste pits dotted across Vaca Muerta. A large mound rises above the Comarsa waste plant about 4 miles (6km) outside Neuqu\u00e9n. Closed by the authorities because of its proximity to a large urban area, the plant no longer receives waste, but bulldozers are constantly at work turning over the mounds of earth on its grounds. Sections of the cement containment wall around the plant have collapsed. \u201cThere are over 300,000 cubic metres of waste still piled at Comarsa,\u201d said Nogueira. \u201cThe whole waste treatment system is insufficient.\u201d Vaca Muerta has yet to prove its economic viability. Experts say the government\u2019s expectations are hampered by the high cost of fracking in Argentina and the lack of adequate gas transport and waste disposal infrastructure, aggravated by a shaky economy. The country has spent billions of dollars in direct handouts to lure investors. \u201cOil companies aren\u2019t extracting hydrocarbons from Vaca Muerta. They\u2019re extracting subsidies,\u201d says Enrique Viale, an environmental lawyer and anti-fracking campaigner. The subsidies are ultimately unaffordable for Argentina, according to a report released in March by the Cleveland-based Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. In January the International Monetary Fund, which had put together a $57bn bailout for Argentina in 2018, demanded a trimming of the subsidies. The industry responded with layoffs, the threat of lawsuits against the government and production cuts. \u201cThe abrupt reduction in Argentina\u2019s production subsidy programme \u2026 is shaking investor confidence,\u201d the report states. However grim the outlook for the oil and gas companies, it is the Mapuche indigenous people who are bearing the highest cost for Argentina\u2019s dream of a fracking bonanza. \u201cAs Mapuches, we\u2019re not fighting for just ourselves or our community,\u201d says Albino Campo Maripe. \u201cWe want our children and grandchildren to know that we fought for something that belongs to everyone. Water is life. Every plant is life. The greed of governments is killing the world. The world is not going to end. We are going to end, because we\u2019re killing ourselves.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>At the state funeral of Winston Churchill, one of the pallbearers was Clement Attlee, his wartime deputy. The massive TV audience witnessed a deathly frail Attlee stumble as the lead-lined coffin was carried up the steps of St Paul\u2019s Cathedral. It was a mark of their deep mutual esteem that Churchill had asked for Attlee to be one of his bearers and Attlee had insisted on performing the honour despite his ill health.</p> <p>Thrown together in the dark hours of 1940, the two men forged the cross-party coalition that saved their country from the menace of Nazism and then, when Hitler was done, contested each other at the ballot box for mastery of postwar Britain. In this terrific account of an extraordinary double act, Leo McKinstry rightly contends that their relationship was \u201cunprecedented in the annals of British politics\u201d. A five-year wartime partnership between two leaders, followed by a decade of peacetime competition between them, is unlikely to be repeated.</p> <p>One of the author\u2019s easiest tasks is painting the contrasts. Churchill was charismatic, buccaneering, humorous, impulsive, inclined to lachrymosity, often erratic in his conduct of government and employed his genius with the English language to rouse the nation at its time of gravest peril. He was always the largest character in any room. Attlee was shy, dry, taciturn, cautious, even-tempered, orderly, unsentimental, never a captivating orator and often dismissed as a nonentity. \u201cA funny little mouse\u201d, as Clementine Churchill called him, he spent much of his life in the shade of more obviously gifted contemporaries.</p> <p>The self-effacing socialist was a man of radical politics, but conventional tastes. The flamboyant Tory was a man of conservative politics, but a romantic temperament. His friend FE Smith once remarked: \u201cWinston is easily satisfied with the best.\u201d Churchill, whose extravagance often put him on the edge of bankruptcy, liked to holiday on the French Riviera. For the austere Attlee, it was Frinton. Churchill loved to sit up late with his cronies consuming prodigious amounts of alcohol; Attlee\u2019s favourite evening drink was a bedtime cocoa with his wife, Violet. Churchill believed, from a very early age, that he \u201cwalked with destiny\u201d. He was not surprised to find himself prime minister, only that he had to wait so long. Until it happened, few thought Attlee had it in him to lead Labour to a landslide election victory in 1945 and then preside over a radically reforming government that would change Britain for decades to come.</p> <p>The contrasts, vivid though they were, ultimately mattered less than the deeper commonalities that bonded them. Both had a great love of their country that expressed itself in a profound patriotism, but not a narrow nationalism. We can only guess what Attlee would make of Jeremy Corbyn or Churchill of Boris Johnson, but you have to doubt that they would be impressed. Both had backgrounds as social reformers, Churchill as a Liberal cabinet minister under Lloyd George, Attlee as a welfare worker in the East End of London. Both had strong marriages that sustained them through the bleak stretches of their careers. Both were rather accidental leaders. Attlee secured the Labour leadership mainly because of the vices of more trumpeted rivals. Churchill became prime minister, despite the great reservations of many Tories, because there was no other figure of stature on their benches who had not been discredited by appeasement.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jan/07/winston-churchill-darkest-hour-andrew-rawnsley\">Winston Churchill makes a fine movie star.

      "bodyText": "When Mary Gaitskill\u2019s \u201c#MeToo\u201d novella, This Is Pleasure, was published by the New Yorker in July, it didn\u2019t go viral in the same spectacular way as Kristen Roupenian\u2019s Cat Person did, almost two years previously, just as the #MeToo movement was peaking. Cat Person spoke to many as though it were true. At a time when women were sharing their collective, painful testimony of abuse at the hands of men, a short story that read like a personal essay pinballed across the internet. Now that the frenzy has passed, a new literature is in the process of emerging and it is subtle and nuanced, reaching beyond relatability and identity, and offering no easy answers. In nonfiction and memoir, Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey\u2019s She Said tells how the Weinstein story first broke. Meanwhile, Know My Name by Chanel Miller, whose powerful victim impact statement opened with the line \u201cyou don\u2019t know me but you\u2019ve been inside me\u201d, foreshadowed the movement\u2019s birth. There\u2019s the essay collection Not That Bad: Dispatches from Rape Culture edited by Roxane Gay, and Lucia Osborne-Crowley\u2019s I Choose Elena, a masterful examination of trauma and finding solace in literature. In Things I Didn\u2019t Talk About When I Was a Girl the author Jeannie Vanasco interviews her rapist about what he did to her when at a party when they were 19, and she thought, close friends. Fiction has offered readers a plurality of responses to #MeToo, from the speculative (Sophie Mackintosh\u2019s The Water Cure, Margaret Atwood\u2019s The Testaments) to the contemporary (Queenie, by Candice Carty-Williams, What Red Was by Rosie Price, Shelf Life by Livia Franchini) and the experimental (Peach by Emma Glass). Publishing loves a trend, and I\u2019ll admit to a feeling of queasiness when a proof came through my door along with a blurb proclaiming it \u201cthe first post-Weinstein novel\u201d. The press release for Gaitskill\u2019s This Is Pleasure, which is to be published in standalone book form next month, bills it as \u201cA masterful fictional contribution to the MeToo debate.

The EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, told diplomats last night that<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/13/barnier-warns-brexit-talks-have-been-difficult-amid-pessimism-over-deal\"> Boris Johnson\u2019s Irish border proposals</a> remained an \u201cuntested\u201d risk that the bloc could not countenance.

If there\u2019s no deal he has until 11pm that night to request an extension.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Kurds strike a deal with Damascus</strong> \u2013 In a dramatic development overnight, the Kurdish forces in north-eastern Syria are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/13/kurds-reach-deal-with-damascus-in-face-of-turkish-offensive\">reported to have struck a deal with Damascus</a> to stave off the bloody Turkish assault. Kurdish forces will surrender the towns of Manbij and Kobane, in exchange for help fighting the Turkish assault. Syrian state media said army units were moving north to \u201cconfront Turkish aggression on Syrian territory\u201d. The deal came amid reports that more than 700 prisoners with links to Islamic State had escaped a detention centre in the area. A French spokesperson said it was not clear who had escaped, but \u201cit has been a worry for France since the beginning of this armed intervention\u201d.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>\u2018The system has to change\u2019</strong> \u2013 The women who kick-started the global #MeToo movement two years ago have warned that the allegations against Harvey Weinstein are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/14/metoo-two-years-weinstein-allegations-tip-of-iceberg-accusers-zelda-perkins-rosanna-arquette\">\u201conly the tip of the iceberg\u201d</a>.

      "bodyText": "Top story: \u2018Drastically increased\u2019 penalties for crime Good morning and welcome to this Monday briefing with Alison Rourke. Violent criminals and sexual offenders will face drastically harsher penalties to be laid out in the Queen\u2019s speech this morning, as the government sets out its legislative agenda. Law and order will top the bill, including \u201cdrastically increased\u201d penalties for foreign nationals who breach deportation orders. No 10 hopes it will wrestle the spotlight from this week\u2019s delicate Brexit negotiations and set the stage for a general election that few in Westminster think will be long in coming. But it\u2019s hard to see how any speech, from the Queen or not, will divert from this week\u2019s political drama, with some EU capitals concluding over the weekend that it may now be impossible for the UK to leave the EU by 31 October with a deal. The EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, told diplomats last night that Boris Johnson\u2019s Irish border proposals remained an \u201cuntested\u201d risk that the bloc could not countenance. A leaders\u2019 summit is due to take place on Thursday, when it may become clear if a deal is doable or not. On Saturday the PM will either present the Commons with an EU-backed Brexit deal or set out his next steps. If there\u2019s no deal he has until 11pm that night to request an extension. * * * Kurds strike a deal with Damascus \u2013 In a dramatic development overnight, the Kurdish forces in north-eastern Syria are reported to have struck a deal with Damascus to stave off the bloody Turkish assault. Kurdish forces will surrender the towns of Manbij and Kobane, in exchange for help fighting the Turkish assault. Syrian state media said army units were moving north to \u201cconfront Turkish aggression on Syrian territory\u201d. The deal came amid reports that more than 700 prisoners with links to Islamic State had escaped a detention centre in the area. A French spokesperson said it was not clear who had escaped, but \u201cit has been a worry for France since the beginning of this armed intervention\u201d. * * * \u2018The system has to change\u2019 \u2013 The women who kick-started the global #MeToo movement two years ago have warned that the allegations against Harvey Weinstein are \u201conly the tip of the iceberg\u201d. The movie mogul\u2019s former assistant and theatre producer Zelda Perkins and the actor Rosanna Arquette, hailed a \u201cprofound transformation\u201d since they spoke out, but told the Guardian there were likely more revelations to come about high-profile men abusing their positions. \u201cThe real issue is that society and the system needs to change because currently the systems all work in favour of the powerful,\u201d said Perkins. According to Melissa Silverstein, the founder of Women and Hollywood, the #MeToo movement has been \u201cnothing short of revolutionary\u201d and \u201creshaped the film industry\u2019s DNA\u201d, but film festivals as institutions are still lagging behind. Closer to home hundreds of callers have contacted a Westminster hotline set up to help advise people who have experienced inappropriate behaviour in parliament in the aftermath of the \u201cPestminster scandal\u201d. But Labour MP Jess Phillips says the \u201cculture hasn\u2019t changed\u201d. In the City, a recent tribunal case brought by banker Stacey Macken shows sexual discrimination remains a problem, despite winning her case over pay discrimination. Macken says she was subject to persistent harassment, crude stories and targeted by a prank that involved leaving a witch\u2019s hat on her desk. * * * Pregnancy risk from drinking \u2013 Alcohol firms and the bodies they fund are encouraging expectant mothers to drink \u2013 putting their unborn child in danger \u2013 by publishing false and misleading information about the risks involved. New research, published in the Journal of Studies on Alcohol, claims it is part of a drive to \u201cnudge\u201d pregnant women into continuing to drink because young people are turning away from alcohol. It found industry bodies globally are promoting \u201clight drinking\u201d as safe. Some ignored, downplayed or sparked confusion about the scientific basis of official advice to abstain completely during pregnancy. * * * Hungary election shock \u2013 Prime minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n has suffered his first electoral blow since coming to power in 2010, with an opposition-backed candidate recording a shock win in the Budapest mayoral race overnight. Gergely Kar\u00e1csony, a centre-left, pro-European candidate, said his win was \u201chistoric\u201d; before the vote he had compared it to Istanbul\u2019s landmark mayoral race in March, which was won by an opposition candidate, in a serious blow to Turkey\u2019s president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan. Kar\u00e1csony\u2019s win in the Hungarian capital was repeated in many places across the country. Meanwhile in Poland, the rightwing Law and Justice party is set to win a majority in the country\u2019s parliament and secure another four-year term, after exit polls showed it won 43.6% of the vote, up from 37.6% in 2015. * * * Fortnite black hole \u2013 It might be the dream of many parents, but millions of gamers were horrified when they saw an asteroid that had been looming in the game, spark up and turn into a black hole. Within a short time, the asteroid had blown up the entire map of the online battleground. A lot of time and in some cases money has been invested in the international phenomenon that is Fortnite, particularly by the most hardcore players. But many were left wondering if this was the end of the game, or just an attention-grabbing space catastrophe to mark the start of a new season (a season lasts around 10 weeks). I\u2019ll leave you to be the judge. Today in Focus podcast: What is the truth about vaping? Jamie Doward and Max Sanderson join Anushka Asthana to navigate a way through the haze of the debate around vaping. Is it really safe? Plus: Frances Perraudin on the anniversary of #MeToo \u2013 what has really changed after two years of the campaign against sexual harassment and sexual assault? Lunchtime read: \u2018I\u2019ve lost people before \u2026 this is different\u2019 The pioneering musician Tricky was raised among gangsters and tough women who taught him to survive. But nothing prepared him for his biggest loss in life: his daughter, Mazy. \u201cOne of the biggest problems with my daughter is that I\u2019ve never loved anybody that much before,\u201d he tells Tim Jonze of the 24-year-old, who passed away this year. His autobiography charts his unlikely rise from young Bristol tearaway to one of British music\u2019s most creative visionaries.

Brigid Kosgei delivered a dizzying head-twister of a performance to blow away Paula Radcliffe\u2019s world marathon record, but a miserable fortnight for Mo Farah took a sharp turn for the worse in Chicago as he trudged home more than four minutes behind the leaders in his worst ever marathon time.

John Lanchester\u2019s novel <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/feb/24/capital-john-lanchester-review\" title=\"\">Capital</a></strong> follows inhabitants of Pepys Road \u2013 a fictional residential street in London \u2013 in the run up to the financial crisis. Many of the characters become caught up in the \u201cdelusion of thrift\u201d, believing that they have amassed unimaginable wealth through their own hard work and smart investments, when in fact they are simply living through the tail end of a financial boom. Like so many others, residents of Pepys Road released the equity from their houses for home improvements without anticipating what would come next.</p> <p>In the spirit of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/john-maynard-keynes\" title=\"\">JM Keynes</a> \u2013 who famously called for the \u201ceuthanasia of the rentier\u201d \u2013 many would have us believe that the rentier\u2019s rise represents a perversion of an otherwise well-functioning capitalism. The reality is far more complex. Tony Norfield\u2019s <strong>The City</strong> draws on the work of the Marxist economist Rudolf Hilferding to assert that the growing dominance of finance in the global economy is not an aberration of an otherwise sound model, but a result of the development of capitalism. \u201cIf you do not like \u2018finance\u2019 but have no problem with the capitalist system, you ought to think a little more, since the two are inseparable,\u201d Norfield argues.</p> <p>Nowhere is this clearer than in politics. Capitalism is, after all, not simply an economic system, but a social and political one, too. As Astra Taylor observes in <strong>Democracy May Not Exist </strong><strong>But </strong><strong>We\u2019ll Miss </strong><strong>It </strong><strong>When It\u2019s Gone</strong>, the principles of democracy \u2013 solidarity, interdependence and community \u2013 have been corrupted by the logic of financial capitalism: greed, exploitation and ruthless competition. As the elite uses its power to tilt the rules of the game to its advantage, Taylor calls for a radical rethink not just of capitalism, but of democracy. The only way to solve the crisis in capitalism is for the interests of those who live from work to trump those of people who live off wealth.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Grace Blakeley is the author of Stolen: How to Save the World from Financialisation</em><em> (Repeater</em><em>).</em></p>",

Like so many others, residents of Pepys Road released the equity from their houses for home improvements without anticipating what would come next. In the spirit of JM Keynes \u2013 who famously called for the \u201ceuthanasia of the rentier\u201d \u2013 many would have us believe that the rentier\u2019s rise represents a perversion of an otherwise well-functioning capitalism. The reality is far more complex. Tony Norfield\u2019s The City draws on the work of the Marxist economist Rudolf Hilferding to assert that the growing dominance of finance in the global economy is not an aberration of an otherwise sound model, but a result of the development of capitalism. \u201cIf you do not like \u2018finance\u2019 but have no problem with the capitalist system, you ought to think a little more, since the two are inseparable,\u201d Norfield argues. Nowhere is this clearer than in politics. Capitalism is, after all, not simply an economic system, but a social and political one, too. As Astra Taylor observes in Democracy May Not Exist But We\u2019ll Miss It When It\u2019s Gone, the principles of democracy \u2013 solidarity, interdependence and community \u2013 have been corrupted by the logic of financial capitalism: greed, exploitation and ruthless competition. As the elite uses its power to tilt the rules of the game to its advantage, Taylor calls for a radical rethink not just of capitalism, but of democracy. The only way to solve the crisis in capitalism is for the interests of those who live from work to trump those of people who live off wealth. \u2022 Grace Blakeley is the author of Stolen: How to Save the World from Financialisation (Repeater).",

      "bodyText": "The New Zealand government will create a dedicated investigative team to find and prosecute terrorist and extremist content online, seven months after a gunman live-streamed the mass murder of 51 worshippers at two Christchurch mosques. Prime minister Jacinda Ardern said NZ$17m would be spent over four years to employ 17 new full-time staff, allowing the department of internal affairs to double its investigative, forensic, intelligence and prevention work in partnership with other countries. \u201cWe will have a dedicated team focused on targeting and disrupting violent extremist content across our digital channels. This will work in a similar way to how we target child sexual exploitation material by working with online content hosts to find and remove harmful content,\u201d Ardern said. The package is the main domestic component of Ardern\u2019s Christchurch Call \u2013 a global voluntary pledge to eliminate terrorist and violent content online devised in the wake of the attack. The country\u2019s worst ever mass shooting was livestreamed on Facebook, and the video was shared on Twitter, YouTube and Facebook-owned apps Whatsapp and Instagram. Ardern said the online world must be a force for good where users can \u201cexchange ideas, share technology, and maintain civil liberties\u201d but \u201cwe need to meet that challenge as a country and as a global community,\u201d. Minister of internal affairs Tracey Martin said the \u201cease and speed\u201d with which the video of the 15 March massacre spread online showed the government needed better systems in place to protect New Zealanders online. Some of the funding would also be directed to the office of the chief censor to enable his team to assess and make faster decisions about harmful content. In the long-term, the government would also strengthen the current laws to ensure it responds more swiftly, and explore how online providers should be regulated. Last week Ardern said the Christchurch Call was already having an impact, citing the contained spread of the recent German shooting livestream video. More than 50 companies and countries have signed the Christchurch Call, including Amazon, Google, Facebook and Twitter. The pledge does not contain any enforcement or regulatory measures, and it is up to each individual country and company to decide how it would honour its voluntary commitments.",

It turns out that the \u201cfatbergs\u201d clogging up our city sewers actually consist of just 0.5% fat and 93% wet wipes. Perhaps we should be calling them \u201cwipebergs\u201d.</p> \n<p>A short animated film stars Serkis as a talking anus, highlighting the damaging impact of our addiction to wet wipes and calling for the public to \u201cbe a good a**hole\u201d and dispose of them responsibly.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"9aaa1aa3-338e-4a9f-a1ec-739fd8716368\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Campaigns to educate people about how not to feed fatbergs take pains to remind us that toilets and sinks are not \u201cmagic portals\u201d. There is a simple set of rules for the bathroom: stick to flushing the three Ps: pee, poo and (toilet) paper. Everything else \u2013 sanitary towels, nappies, cotton buds, condoms, dental floss, used plasters and whatever else you might think to chuck down the toilet \u2013 should go into the bin.</p>\n    <p>Just because a product says it is flushable doesn\u2019t mean that it is biodegradable. Baby wipes might be a godsend to parents, but not to Victorian-era sewerage systems. Wipes marketed as flushable will probably be able to make their way down your toilet, but will eventually clog up the pipes further along their journey.</p>\n    <p>The kitchen is another area of concern. Water companies are keen to bust the myth that running hot water and pouring washing-up liquid down the sink ahead of fats, oils or grease will stop it building up and blocking the pipes. Their recommendation is to keep a small container, such as an old margarine tub, to hand in your kitchen, into which you can pour oil and fat before safely disposing of it in the bin.</p>\n    <p><b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a></b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cAll across the news we are seeing people take a stand to look after our planet,\u201d says Serkis. \u201cIt\u2019s only one tiny change we can all make which goes a long way in protecting our oceans.</p> \n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever feel so passionate to take on the role of a talking asshole.\u201d</p> \n<p>Last year the UK used 10.8bn wet wipes, almost a third of which were flushed down toilets. </p> \n<p>The majority of wet wipes sold in the UK contain plastic and are not biodegradable.

      "bodyText": "Andy Serkis is familiar with playing malevolent creatures that lurk in the darkness, so it is perhaps fitting that the Lord of the Rings actor is now raising awareness about the unsightly horrors that lie in the UK\u2019s sewers. A new campaign is warning against flushing wet wipes down the toilet. It turns out that the \u201cfatbergs\u201d clogging up our city sewers actually consist of just 0.5% fat and 93% wet wipes. Perhaps we should be calling them \u201cwipebergs\u201d. A short animated film stars Serkis as a talking anus, highlighting the damaging impact of our addiction to wet wipes and calling for the public to \u201cbe a good a**hole\u201d and dispose of them responsibly. \u201cAll across the news we are seeing people take a stand to look after our planet,\u201d says Serkis. \u201cIt\u2019s only one tiny change we can all make which goes a long way in protecting our oceans. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever feel so passionate to take on the role of a talking asshole.\u201d Last year the UK used 10.8bn wet wipes, almost a third of which were flushed down toilets. The majority of wet wipes sold in the UK contain plastic and are not biodegradable. They combine with household cooking fats and other hygiene products to form huge solid masses, known as fatbergs. These can cause sewage systems to overflow, polluting waterways and seas, says City to Sea, a plastic pollution campaigning organisation behind the drive. Earlier this year a monster fatberg the size of a jumbo jet was discovered beneath Liverpool, and risked flooding the city\u2019s streets with raw sewage. It weighed the same as 13 African elephants. So far, more fatbergs have been discovered in London than anywhere else in the UK. In 2017, a terrifying 250-metre behemoth that was estimated to weigh 130 tonnes was found in Whitechapel. The capital\u2019s crumbling Victorian-style sewers are struggling to cope with our wet wipe addiction and overflow on average once a week, dumping the wipes into the River Thames. Mounds of wet wipes have built up on the riverbed over the years, changing the shape of London\u2019s beloved waterway. In 2018, Thames 21, a London environmental organisation that cleans up rivers and canals, retrieved 5,453 wet wipes in 116 sq metres of the Thames embankment near Hammersmith. Wet wipes also find their way on to UK beaches, where they have increased by almost 700% over the last decade. They are also a global problem: Belfast, Denver, and Melbourne have all discovered large fatbergs lurking in their sewers. Nor is it just big cities that are affected: sewer workers in the English seaside town of Sidmouth recently found a fatberg that was 210ft (64m) long. Part of the reason so many are flushed appears to stem from the fact that many of the companies producing them call their products \u201cflushables\u201d and do not clearly label the packaging with what they\u2019re actually made of. \u201cThere is a confusion when we are told we can flush them,\u201d says City to Sea founder Natalie Fee. \u201cYes, physically they can pass through a toilet, but the material they are made of doesn\u2019t break down. People don\u2019t realise that it\u2019s like flushing a plastic bag down the toilet.\u201d In the US, some cities are taking legal action against companies for misleading the public about their product\u2019s \u201cflushability\u201d. In 2015, the city of Wyoming in Minnesota filed a class-action suit against Procter &amp; Gamble, Kimberly-Clark, Nice-Pak, and three other wet-wipe manufacturers for fraudulently promoting their products as flushable. Although wet wipes are a favourite for cleaning babies, it\u2019s not just parents who are the culprits: Keep Britain Tidy research shows that younger people are most likely to flush, not bin, with 65% of 18-24 year olds admitting to putting wet wipes, sanitary products, cotton buds, cotton wool products or condoms down the toilet. In an effort to further combat this bad habit, the London assembly last year called for sanitary bins to also be introduced in men\u2019s toilets.

      "bodyText": "Steve Hansen has warned Ireland that recent form will count for nothing when the two sides meet in the World Cup quarter-final at Tokyo Stadium on Saturday evening. Ireland have beaten the All Blacks twice in three meetings since the last World Cup, including a 16-9 victory in a relentlessly physical encounter in Dublin last November, and they arrived in Japan at the top of the world rankings having nudged New Zealand off the top. \u201cIreland are a very good side and our last three results against them are lost, won, lost,\u201d said Hansen, who is in his final month as the All Blacks\u2019 head coach having taken over from Sir Graham Henry at the end of 2011. \u201cWe are now at the stage of the tournament where games are do-or-die and that makes it pretty exciting. \u201cThey won last November because they were better than us on the day in a titanic struggle. Like us, they have a settled way of playing that works for them. We enjoy facing Ireland and that has not changed because they have beaten us. A lot of people get caught up in the past, but it is what happens on Saturday that is relevant.\u201d The All Blacks will go into the match having not played for nearly two weeks after their game against Italy in Toyota last weekend was called off because of Typhoon Hagibis, but Hansen is not worried that his players will go into the quarter-final underdone. \u201cWe were locked in our hotel on Saturday and having a week off is not a bad thing,\u201d said Hansen. \u201cIt allowed us to work really hard on Friday when the GPS numbers were just above what a normal Test match would be so we don\u2019t feel we have lost an opportunity to be where we need to be. \u201cWe would like to pass on our sympathies to people in Japan who have lost family members. Having been through a natural disaster myself, I know it can be pretty shaking. We are very supportive of them.\u201d Hansen paid tribute to the hosts Japan who made it to the knock-out stage for the first time when they defeated Scotland in Yokohama with some of their play, especially in the opening half, reminiscent of the All Blacks in terms of passing, handling, support play and speed. \u201cIt is a good way of playing footy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt worked against Ireland and now against Scotland.

By the time they were even aware of such things, the end of the second world war was a quarter of a century away, and what remained of the empire was being <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NTaDnKW64BIC&amp;pg=PA101&amp;lpg=PA101&amp;dq=%22Fiji,+Mauritius,+Swaziland,+the+New+Hebrides%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=e9ediUVYi3&amp;sig=ACfU3U0Qxy5ZvsnfDxdihD5RR-7ObjO-Xg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjtxLHp6pPlAhXzQUEAHVDtDT8Q6AEwAHoECAEQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Fiji%2C%20Mauritius%2C%20Swaziland%2C%20the%20New%20Hebrides%22&amp;f=false\" title=\"\">mocked on TV by David Frost</a> (\u201cFiji, Mauritius, Swaziland, the New Hebrides Condominium \u2026 and sweet Rockall\u201d).

This is not just because of our impossible historical distance from the events these people eulogise and the social transformations that have happened in the meantime (self-evidently, to yearn for the spirit of pre-50s Britain runs the risk of celebrating a country that was monoculturally white and ridden with bigotry, and an imperial ideal racist in both theory and practice). Decades of cultural history have also undermined just about every aspect of the Brexiteers\u2019 view of things.</p> <p>The first Colonel Blimp cartoon, I was recently reminded, <a href=\"https://wordhistories.net/2019/06/30/colonel-blimp/\" title=\"\">appeared in 1934</a>. With no little prescience, it was captioned: \u201cGad, sir, Lord Beaverbrook is right. Splendid isolation is the policy for England. If we refuse to trade with the dashed foreigners in Ireland, Wales and Scotland \u2026 the future will be in sight.\u201d Later on, didn\u2019t the great cultural explosions of the 60s decisively pull us away from the last traces of wartime jingoism, as the union flag was reinvented as a totem of camp, and the supposed glories of war and empire were suddenly sent up? In the Beatles\u2019 1967 masterpiece A Day in the Life, the enervated, gently mocking way that John Lennon sings one line in particular \u2013 \u201cThe English army had just won the war\u201d \u2013 seems to open up the possibility of a whole load of national delusions being subverted.</p> <p>And so it proved: the so-called <a href=\"https://www.popmatters.com/great-silly-grin-2496245246.html\" title=\"\">satire boom</a> was already in full flow \u2013 and then along came Monty Python\u2019s bursting of every pompous English balloon, and even Dad\u2019s Army, with its affectionate portrayal of the farce and hilarity woven into the country\u2019s finest hour.</p> <p>When the UK\u2019s descent into economic decline was met with Margaret Thatcher\u2019s flag-waving and the rise of the National Front, it fell to the new generation of punks to try to explode their fantasies (listen to such songs as the Clash\u2019s Something About England, the Jam\u2019s <a href=\"https://genius.com/The-jam-little-boy-soldiers-lyrics\" title=\"\">Little Boy Soldiers</a>, or the Sex Pistols\u2019 ageless God Save the Queen). And so this strand of popular culture has gone on, speaking directly to millions of people and shaping their understanding of the country they live in. In the midst of the current madness, a good example is the Northampton-born rapper <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/may/11/slowthai-i-love-britain-great\" title=\"\">Slowthai</a>, who has Caribbean, Irish and English ancestry, and styles himself as the Brexit Bandit. The <a href=\"https://genius.com/Slowthai-nothing-great-about-britain-lyrics\" title=\"\">title track of his debut album</a> speaks volumes: \u201cI said there\u2019s nothing great about the place we live in/ Nothing great about Britain/ Sip a cup of tea whilst we\u2019re spittin\u2019/ There\u2019s nothing great about Britain.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/12/angela-merkel-boris-johnson-leaked-brexit-phone-call\">Can Anglo-German relations survive that disastrous London-Berlin phone call?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yet the old illusions refuse to die. To state the obvious, much of the blame for this country\u2019s enduring mixture of hubris, nostalgia and Europhobia can be laid at the door of the tabloid press. It is responsible for framing everything from Germany v England football matches to <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2784339.stm\" title=\"\">Jacques Chirac\u2019s opposition to the Iraq war</a> in terms of unfinished business from 1939-45, and the idea that many European countries owe us a debt of gratitude they have never paid off. But there are also other, more insidious influences at work. When the likes of Farage and Francois <a href=\"https://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/590396/Nigel-Farage-European-Union-EU-referendum-Battle-of-Britain\" title=\"\">talk about the war</a>, I hear not an authentic echo of the struggles and victories of 1939-45, but the big-selling and very stupid comics I used to buy as a child in the late 70s: <a href=\"https://nothingbutafan.wordpress.com/2015/09/23/action-all-the-way-with-warlord-41-years-young/\" title=\"\">Warlord</a> and <a href=\"http://popculture.mearsonlineauctions.com/1977_victor_british_war_comic__843_851____853_858_-lot46411.aspx\" title=\"\">Victor</a>, replete with stories of \u201cJerries\u201d and \u201cJaps\u201d, such characters as Union Jack Jackson and Bomber Braddock, and the basic message they carried \u2013 that there was no finer expression of Britishness than charging at the enemy, hoping for the best.</p> <p>To anyone under 40, these things must surely seem weird beyond words, which ought to give cause for hope. So too might one basic fact about the Brexit moment: that the comical fantasy of a belligerent UK blazing its own trail is already being tested by reality. There again, given that the fictions of war and empire have endured for so long, would they really suddenly wither away? The results of the election \u2013 or, perhaps, another referendum \u2013 will give us an answer of sorts: one of the reasons why the next few months will decide not just who is in power, but the kind of place this conflicted, nervous country is going to be.</p> <p>\u2022 John Harris is a Guardian columnist</p>",

Johnson fumes about parliament\u2019s \u201csurrender bill\u201d, as those increasingly irksome No 10 \u201csources\u201d warn of MPs colluding with \u201cforeign powers\u201d. Nigel Farage rallies begin with the sound of air-raid sirens. Allies and supporters of the prime minister regularly bring up his Churchill fixation, and claim that the spirit of the man on the \u00a35 banknote is being channelled anew, even though what is afoot is obviously much less noble than that. Last week, when he and his people decided to blame Angela Merkel for their waning hopes of a deal, they surely knew what they were doing: tapping into a rich seam of British prejudice that was made clear last week in a Twitter meme put around by Arron Banks and his accomplices at Leave.EU, only to be deleted. \u201cWe didn\u2019t win two world wars to be pushed around by a Kraut,\u201d it said: a view of 20th-century history traditionally voiced by English football hooligans after 12 lagers and too much sunshine. Banks was born in 1966; Johnson and Farage in 1964. Mark Francois, the Conservative MP who needs no encouragement to hold forth about his father\u2019s wartime service and the necessity of standing up to Germany, entered the world in 1965. By the time they were even aware of such things, the end of the second world war was a quarter of a century away, and what remained of the empire was being mocked on TV by David Frost (\u201cFiji, Mauritius, Swaziland, the New Hebrides Condominium \u2026 and sweet Rockall\u201d). But more than 50 years on, their secondhand nostalgia seems to have found a ready audience, as keen as them on the idea that Britannia could once again rule the waves and stick it to the continentals, if only the people Johnson calls \u201cthe doomsters and the gloomsters\u201d would let her. That the prime minister often presents this stuff wrapped in a sense of the absurd only highlights how ludicrously misplaced it all is. This is not just because of our impossible historical distance from the events these people eulogise and the social transformations that have happened in the meantime (self-evidently, to yearn for the spirit of pre-50s Britain runs the risk of celebrating a country that was monoculturally white and ridden with bigotry, and an imperial ideal racist in both theory and practice). Decades of cultural history have also undermined just about every aspect of the Brexiteers\u2019 view of things. The first Colonel Blimp cartoon, I was recently reminded, appeared in 1934. With no little prescience, it was captioned: \u201cGad, sir, Lord Beaverbrook is right. Splendid isolation is the policy for England. If we refuse to trade with the dashed foreigners in Ireland, Wales and Scotland \u2026 the future will be in sight.\u201d Later on, didn\u2019t the great cultural explosions of the 60s decisively pull us away from the last traces of wartime jingoism, as the union flag was reinvented as a totem of camp, and the supposed glories of war and empire were suddenly sent up? In the Beatles\u2019 1967 masterpiece A Day in the Life, the enervated, gently mocking way that John Lennon sings one line in particular \u2013 \u201cThe English army had just won the war\u201d \u2013 seems to open up the possibility of a whole load of national delusions being subverted. And so it proved: the so-called satire boom was already in full flow \u2013 and then along came Monty Python\u2019s bursting of every pompous English balloon, and even Dad\u2019s Army, with its affectionate portrayal of the farce and hilarity woven into the country\u2019s finest hour. When the UK\u2019s descent into economic decline was met with Margaret Thatcher\u2019s flag-waving and the rise of the National Front, it fell to the new generation of punks to try to explode their fantasies (listen to such songs as the Clash\u2019s Something About England, the Jam\u2019s Little Boy Soldiers, or the Sex Pistols\u2019 ageless God Save the Queen). And so this strand of popular culture has gone on, speaking directly to millions of people and shaping their understanding of the country they live in. In the midst of the current madness, a good example is the Northampton-born rapper Slowthai, who has Caribbean, Irish and English ancestry, and styles himself as the Brexit Bandit. The title track of his debut album speaks volumes: \u201cI said there\u2019s nothing great about the place we live in/ Nothing great about Britain/ Sip a cup of tea whilst we\u2019re spittin\u2019/ There\u2019s nothing great about Britain.\u201d Yet the old illusions refuse to die. To state the obvious, much of the blame for this country\u2019s enduring mixture of hubris, nostalgia and Europhobia can be laid at the door of the tabloid press. It is responsible for framing everything from Germany v England football matches to Jacques Chirac\u2019s opposition to the Iraq war in terms of unfinished business from 1939-45, and the idea that many European countries owe us a debt of gratitude they have never paid off. But there are also other, more insidious influences at work. When the likes of Farage and Francois talk about the war, I hear not an authentic echo of the struggles and victories of 1939-45, but the big-selling and very stupid comics I used to buy as a child in the late 70s: Warlord and Victor, replete with stories of \u201cJerries\u201d and \u201cJaps\u201d, such characters as Union Jack Jackson and Bomber Braddock, and the basic message they carried \u2013 that there was no finer expression of Britishness than charging at the enemy, hoping for the best. To anyone under 40, these things must surely seem weird beyond words, which ought to give cause for hope. So too might one basic fact about the Brexit moment: that the comical fantasy of a belligerent UK blazing its own trail is already being tested by reality. There again, given that the fictions of war and empire have endured for so long, would they really suddenly wither away? The results of the election \u2013 or, perhaps, another referendum \u2013 will give us an answer of sorts: one of the reasons why the next few months will decide not just who is in power, but the kind of place this conflicted, nervous country is going to be. \u2022 John Harris is a Guardian columnist",

It\u2019s not quite the response I was anticipating, given that he has been photographing the country for 40 years now and his best shots are about to go on show at the <a href=\"https://museum.wales/cardiff/whatson/10826/Photography-Season/\">National Museum in Cardiff</a>.

It\u2019s a great opportunity to subvert that.\u201d</p> <p>Parr is sitting at a low table piled high with photographs when I arrive at his office in Bristol. These are pictures of recent protests (pro-<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a>, anti-Brexit, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change\">climate crisis</a>) that might eventually find their way into a book: Parr on Protest, perhaps. The photographer has produced more than 100 books in his 45-year career \u2013 extended photo-essays exploring such subjects as tourism, consumerism and class. As for Wales, it\u2019s not far from Bristol \u2013 and anyway, Parr has a holiday flat overlooking his beloved beach at Tenby, on the country\u2019s south coast.</p> <p>The first photograph in the show is a black-and-white image from 1975 of a bemused middle-aged couple at the summit of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/dec/14/in-praise-of-snowdonia-wales-holidays-myths-legends\">Snowdon</a>, evidently wondering what they should do now. As ever with Parr\u2019s work, there is a twist, a trace of sardonic humour: the woman appears to have brought several handbags on the ascent. There are also a few photographs of Tower Colliery near Aberdare, the oldest continuously working deep mine in the UK until its closure in 2008. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1ca3bc1e35ced27ca590b898cfaae916aaa738c8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ca3bc1e35ced27ca590b898cfaae916aaa738c8/0_333_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Is this all there is?\u2019 \u2026 handbags at the top of Snowdon, 1975.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Is <em>this</em> all there is?\u2019 \u2026 handbags at the top of Snowdon, 1975.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Parr/Magnum Photos</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The shots of this vanished world come as a surprise after the cakes and beaches, especially the picture of miners marching in protest at closures, the show\u2019s sole explicitly political note. But even in his set of mining photographs, Parr catches the sheer oddness of life, photographing one blackened miner drinking a cup of tea in an austere room brightened only by a Christmas tree sitting on the table. Another case of getting by in challenging circumstances.</p> <p>Parr\u2019s photographs are often witty. In another shot, a butcher\u2019s arm echoes the strings of sausages in his shop window. \u201cI like humour,\u201d says Parr. \u201cWe learn a lot by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/comedy\">listening to standup comics</a>. The vulnerability they often express has an overlap with the vulnerability I\u2019m looking for in my own work. The world is funny, let\u2019s face it, and people are funny.\u201d</p> <p>Parr, who is 67 and was born in Epsom, Surrey, says his Welsh photographs should be seen in the context of a lifelong project to document the whole of Britain, an endeavour now reaching an even larger audience thanks to the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-38486283\">idents</a>\u201d he has done for BBC One. As they draw breath between programmes, viewers are treated to Parr\u2019s clips of like-minded people coming together: potholers, bhangra dancers, kayakers, lifeguards, junior footballers, female boxers, wheelchair-using rugby players, bog snorkellers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"925fd1b9aab3f1af5bee8006e99c57e2d455b449\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/925fd1b9aab3f1af5bee8006e99c57e2d455b449/0_0_8222_6689/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sardonic humour \u2026 Tower \ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffcColliery, Glamorgan, 1993.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"814\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sardonic humour \u2026 Tower \ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffcColliery, Glamorgan, 1993.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Parr/Magnum Photos/Rocket Gallery</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cMy affection for Wales is very high,\u201d says Parr. \u201cBut my preoccupation is with the United Kingdom. I recently did <a href=\"https://www.martinparrfoundation.org/product/think-of-scotland/\">a book on Scotland</a>.\u201d There will be a show there, too, in Aberdeen. \u201cIt\u2019s a phase I\u2019m going through. Next year I\u2019ll be doing an Irish book because I\u2019ve spent a lot of time there as well.\u201d</p> <p>His Bristol HQ, <a href=\"https://www.martinparrfoundation.org/\">The Martin Parr Foundation</a>, opened in 2017 and houses not only his own archive of more than one million images but the work of other postwar British documentary photographers. The foundation puts on shows, organises talks and publishes books. Its latest volume is a tribute to <a href=\"https://canterburymuseums.co.uk/events/only-in-england/\">Tony Ray-Jones</a>, a pioneering British photographer who died in 1972 at the age of 30.</p> <p>Ray-Jones also loved beaches and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2013/sep/20/tony-ray-jones-england-in-pictures\">captured their quirky British</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2013/sep/20/tony-ray-jones-england-in-pictures\">ness</a> in arresting black and white. Parr, who regards the beach as a great democratic space where people truly express themselves, <a href=\"http://www.photohistories.com/Photo-Histories/65/tony-ray-jones-and-the-lyrical-origin-of-parrworld\">took his stylistic cue from Ray-Jones</a>, then led the move to saturated colour photography with his breakthrough exhibition and book <a href=\"https://www.magnumphotos.com/arts-culture/society-arts-culture/martin-parr-the-last-resort/\">The Last Resort</a> in 1986. He says he was applying the techniques used in advertising to documentary photography \u2013 and has now not merely become a photographic institution but opened one, employing 10 hyper-energetic young people at his foundation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d9c558abb81634ae26e24c8c937f4c207a900e02\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d9c558abb81634ae26e24c8c937f4c207a900e02/0_0_5000_3334/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Barry Island, Wales, 1996.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Echoes of Merseyside \u2026 Barry Island, Wales, 1996.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Parr/Magnum Photos</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Last Resort, which photographed daytrippers to New Brighton on Merseyside, was criticised by some as patronising. These critics might feel the same way about Parr\u2019s photographs of the Welsh <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/class-issues\">working class</a>. A shot in the Cardiff show, of a boy being fed beans and chips, seems to echo his famous photograph of two children in New Brighton standing at a kerb luxuriating in their gooey ice creams. \u201cI\u2019m pretty democratic when it comes to classes,\u201d is all he will say in response to such criticism. \u201cI\u2019ve done them all \u2013 though it\u2019s more difficult to identify a posher class in Wales.\u201d</p> <p>When Parr applied to be a full member of the celebrated Magnum photo agency in 1994, his application was opposed by <a href=\"https://www.magnumphotos.com/photographer/philip-jones-griffiths/\">photojournalist Philip Jones Griffiths</a>, famous for his pictures of the Vietnam war. Jones Griffiths believed in photography as an agent of social change. Parr, he argued, \u201chas always shunned the values that Magnum was built on. Not for him any of our concerned \u2018finger on the pulse of society\u2019 humanistic photography.\u201d</p> <p>Jones Griffiths believed Parr\u2019s membership would be a repudiation of everything Magnum stood for. But in the end, Parr wasn\u2019t just elected \u2013 he went on to serve as president of the agency for four years, suggesting he won not just the battle but the war. It shows Parr\u2019s steeliness that he rode out both that attack and another from the great French photographer (and Magnum co-founder) <a href=\"https://www.magnumphotos.com/photographer/henri-cartier-bresson/\">Henri Cartier-Bresson</a>, who claimed Parr\u2019s work was \u201cfrom another planet\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"79d666b0202f26687524889201483d677b04fa88\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/79d666b0202f26687524889201483d677b04fa88/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"One of his favourites \u2026 ice cream van at Tenby beach, 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of his favourites \u2026 ice-cream van at Tenby beach, 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Parr/Magnum Photos/Rocket Gallery</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIf I hadn\u2019t got into Magnum,\u201d says Parr, \u201cit wouldn\u2019t have been the end of the world because I was relatively established.

Since then, many other photographers have come in and the agenda has somewhat loosened.\u201d</p> <p>Parr talks me through his picture of a queue for an ice-cream van on the beach at Tenby, a shot he is particularly pleased with. His beach pictures are full of the sort of mini-dramas his idol Ray-Jones specialised in. The same could be said of that couple surveying Snowdon. You really do want to know what conversation they\u2019re having: \u201cIs <em>this</em> all there is?\u201d </p> <p>\u201cI just show things as I find them,\u201d says Parr innocently. \u201cIt\u2019s not a journalistic statement.

The shots of this vanished world come as a surprise after the cakes and beaches, especially the picture of miners marching in protest at closures, the show\u2019s sole explicitly political note. But even in his set of mining photographs, Parr catches the sheer oddness of life, photographing one blackened miner drinking a cup of tea in an austere room brightened only by a Christmas tree sitting on the table. Another case of getting by in challenging circumstances. Parr\u2019s photographs are often witty. In another shot, a butcher\u2019s arm echoes the strings of sausages in his shop window. \u201cI like humour,\u201d says Parr. \u201cWe learn a lot by listening to standup comics. The vulnerability they often express has an overlap with the vulnerability I\u2019m looking for in my own work. The world is funny, let\u2019s face it, and people are funny.\u201d Parr, who is 67 and was born in Epsom, Surrey, says his Welsh photographs should be seen in the context of a lifelong project to document the whole of Britain, an endeavour now reaching an even larger audience thanks to the \u201cidents\u201d he has done for BBC One. As they draw breath between programmes, viewers are treated to Parr\u2019s clips of like-minded people coming together: potholers, bhangra dancers, kayakers, lifeguards, junior footballers, female boxers, wheelchair-using rugby players, bog snorkellers. \u201cMy affection for Wales is very high,\u201d says Parr. \u201cBut my preoccupation is with the United Kingdom. I recently did a book on Scotland.\u201d There will be a show there, too, in Aberdeen. \u201cIt\u2019s a phase I\u2019m going through. Next year I\u2019ll be doing an Irish book because I\u2019ve spent a lot of time there as well.\u201d His Bristol HQ, The Martin Parr Foundation, opened in 2017 and houses not only his own archive of more than one million images but the work of other postwar British documentary photographers. The foundation puts on shows, organises talks and publishes books. Its latest volume is a tribute to Tony Ray-Jones, a pioneering British photographer who died in 1972 at the age of 30. Ray-Jones also loved beaches and captured their quirky Britishness in arresting black and white. Parr, who regards the beach as a great democratic space where people truly express themselves, took his stylistic cue from Ray-Jones, then led the move to saturated colour photography with his breakthrough exhibition and book The Last Resort in 1986. He says he was applying the techniques used in advertising to documentary photography \u2013 and has now not merely become a photographic institution but opened one, employing 10 hyper-energetic young people at his foundation. The Last Resort, which photographed daytrippers to New Brighton on Merseyside, was criticised by some as patronising. These critics might feel the same way about Parr\u2019s photographs of the Welsh working class. A shot in the Cardiff show, of a boy being fed beans and chips, seems to echo his famous photograph of two children in New Brighton standing at a kerb luxuriating in their gooey ice creams. \u201cI\u2019m pretty democratic when it comes to classes,\u201d is all he will say in response to such criticism. \u201cI\u2019ve done them all \u2013 though it\u2019s more difficult to identify a posher class in Wales.\u201d When Parr applied to be a full member of the celebrated Magnum photo agency in 1994, his application was opposed by photojournalist Philip Jones Griffiths, famous for his pictures of the Vietnam war. Jones Griffiths believed in photography as an agent of social change. Parr, he argued, \u201chas always shunned the values that Magnum was built on. Not for him any of our concerned \u2018finger on the pulse of society\u2019 humanistic photography.\u201d Jones Griffiths believed Parr\u2019s membership would be a repudiation of everything Magnum stood for. But in the end, Parr wasn\u2019t just elected \u2013 he went on to serve as president of the agency for four years, suggesting he won not just the battle but the war. It shows Parr\u2019s steeliness that he rode out both that attack and another from the great French photographer (and Magnum co-founder) Henri Cartier-Bresson, who claimed Parr\u2019s work was \u201cfrom another planet\u201d. \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t got into Magnum,\u201d says Parr, \u201cit wouldn\u2019t have been the end of the world because I was relatively established. But I liked the challenge, and I liked the concept of Magnum. Since then, many other photographers have come in and the agenda has somewhat loosened.\u201d Parr talks me through his picture of a queue for an ice-cream van on the beach at Tenby, a shot he is particularly pleased with. His beach pictures are full of the sort of mini-dramas his idol Ray-Jones specialised in. The same could be said of that couple surveying Snowdon. You really do want to know what conversation they\u2019re having: \u201cIs this all there is?\u201d \u201cI just show things as I find them,\u201d says Parr innocently. \u201cIt\u2019s not a journalistic statement. It\u2019s a personal statement. You could argue it\u2019s fiction based on reality \u2013 my interpretation of the world.\u201d \u2022 Martin Parr in Wales is at National Museum Cardiff, 26 October to 4 May.",

      "body": "<p>Two years ago, the entertainment industry became the primary focus of discussions over abuse, harassment and decades of ingrained sexism after allegations against Harvey Weinstein rocked Hollywood and kickstarted the wider #MeToo movement.</p> <p>While a raft of initiatives have been introduced, including Time\u2019s Up, a group that provides legal support to victims, and <a href=\"https://womenandhollywood.com/resources/festivals-that-have-committed-to-the-gender-parity-pledge/\">50/50 x 2020</a>, a gender parity pledge that all major film festivals have signed up to, industry experts said change has been glacial.</p> <p>Anna Smith, broadcaster, film critic and host of the Girls on Film podcast, said the key question was how awareness translated to actual numbers. \u201cI think there is a bigger support network now. I hope the casting couch culture isn\u2019t tolerated any more,\u201d she said.</p> <p>According to Melissa Silverstein, the founder of <a href=\"https://womenandhollywood.com/about/\">Women and Hollywood</a>, the #MeToo movement has been \u201cnothing short of revolutionary\u201d and \u201creshaped the film industry\u2019s DNA\u201d. But film festivals as institutions are still lagging behind, she said.</p> <p>This year the London film festival said 65% of its films were directed by women, at Toronto it was 36%, while Berlin had eight and Cannes had four films in competition by women. However, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/aug/26/venice-film-festival-gender-disparity-roman-polanski-nate-parker\">Venice film festival</a>\u2019s decision to include only two films by women in its 21-film competition was called an \u201c<a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/how-venice-film-fest-became-tone-deaf-metoo-times-up-1233163\">intentional provocation</a>\u201d before the event in September. Venice also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/aug/28/jury-members-clash-over-roman-polanski-as-venice-film-festival-opens\">premiered films by Roman Polanski</a> \u2013 convicted in 1978, of raping a 13-year-old girl \u2013 and Nate Parker, who was acquitted of an allegation of rape at university.</p> <p>Both issues overshadowed the festival and Silverstein called the decision \u201ccompletely tone-deaf\u201d. \u201cThese festivals have not done enough,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes it feels as if they are just sighing and doing what they need to do because they think this will pass. But it won\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>Smith said the initiatives that have been introduced at Cannes \u2013 such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/10/cannes-festival-adapts-metoo-era-gender-issues-remain\">a creche and a sexual assault hotline</a> \u2013 do little to counter the \u201cpredatory vibe\u201d of some of the parties held during the festival. The lack of women on judging panels is another way progression has been halted, according to Smith. \u201cThe Palme d\u2019Or jury is so often dominated by older men with the odd glamorous young actress,\u201d she said. \u201cThat perpetrates a very out-of-date message \u2013 the kind of world that Weinstein lived in.\u201d</p> <p>Dame Heather Rabbatts, UK chair of Time\u2019s Up, said that the BFI and Bafta\u2019s decision to introduce guidance on preventing bullying and harassment was a sign of improvement, but that the key for the future would be ensuring that organisations \u201cdo what they say they will\u201d and that any initiatives are sustainable.</p> <p>In music, the past 24 months has seen a procession of big name stars coming forward with their own experiences of sexism, harassment and assault. Taylor Swift won a court case against a radio DJ who groped her while taking a photograph with her. Lily Allen gave a detailed account of a record industry executive sexually assaulting her as she slept, warning that similar abuse is \u201crife\u201d in the music business.</p> <p>Hookworms and also The Orwells broke up after accusations of sexual and psychological abuse surfaced \u2013 though all accused deny the allegations. In February, the New York Times levelled a series of accusations of manipulative behaviour at Ryan Adams, who allegedly \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/13/arts/music/ryan-adams-women-sex.html\">dangled career opportunities while simultaneously pursuing female artists for sex</a>\u201d. Adams apologised to anyone hurt but denied all allegations.</p> <p>The Brit awards\u2019 organising body, the British Phonographic Industry, encouraged attendees at the 2018 ceremony to wear a white rose pin \u201cas a symbol of solidarity\u201d, without specifically mentioning a cause in a move that was widely criticised. Vick Bain, a former chief executive of the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors, said the industry should \u201cbe focused on creating meaningful change\u201d, while Paul Pacifico, chief executive of the Association of Independent Music, said he appreciated the gesture \u201cbut we already know there is a problem\u201d.</p> <p>There has been progress on gender parity at some music festivals, with Primavera Sounds in Barcelona achieving a 50/50 split. \u201cIt\u2019s not difficult once your mind is set,\u201d said Primavera\u2019s Marta Pallares Olivares. After research revealed that 80% of festival lineups were male, 45 events pledged to have gender parity on their lineups by 2022.

      "bodyText": "Two years ago, the entertainment industry became the primary focus of discussions over abuse, harassment and decades of ingrained sexism after allegations against Harvey Weinstein rocked Hollywood and kickstarted the wider #MeToo movement. While a raft of initiatives have been introduced, including Time\u2019s Up, a group that provides legal support to victims, and 50/50 x 2020, a gender parity pledge that all major film festivals have signed up to, industry experts said change has been glacial. Anna Smith, broadcaster, film critic and host of the Girls on Film podcast, said the key question was how awareness translated to actual numbers. \u201cI think there is a bigger support network now. I hope the casting couch culture isn\u2019t tolerated any more,\u201d she said. According to Melissa Silverstein, the founder of Women and Hollywood, the #MeToo movement has been \u201cnothing short of revolutionary\u201d and \u201creshaped the film industry\u2019s DNA\u201d. But film festivals as institutions are still lagging behind, she said. This year the London film festival said 65% of its films were directed by women, at Toronto it was 36%, while Berlin had eight and Cannes had four films in competition by women. However, the Venice film festival\u2019s decision to include only two films by women in its 21-film competition was called an \u201cintentional provocation\u201d before the event in September. Venice also premiered films by Roman Polanski \u2013 convicted in 1978, of raping a 13-year-old girl \u2013 and Nate Parker, who was acquitted of an allegation of rape at university. Both issues overshadowed the festival and Silverstein called the decision \u201ccompletely tone-deaf\u201d. \u201cThese festivals have not done enough,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes it feels as if they are just sighing and doing what they need to do because they think this will pass. But it won\u2019t.\u201d Smith said the initiatives that have been introduced at Cannes \u2013 such as a creche and a sexual assault hotline \u2013 do little to counter the \u201cpredatory vibe\u201d of some of the parties held during the festival. The lack of women on judging panels is another way progression has been halted, according to Smith. \u201cThe Palme d\u2019Or jury is so often dominated by older men with the odd glamorous young actress,\u201d she said. \u201cThat perpetrates a very out-of-date message \u2013 the kind of world that Weinstein lived in.\u201d Dame Heather Rabbatts, UK chair of Time\u2019s Up, said that the BFI and Bafta\u2019s decision to introduce guidance on preventing bullying and harassment was a sign of improvement, but that the key for the future would be ensuring that organisations \u201cdo what they say they will\u201d and that any initiatives are sustainable. In music, the past 24 months has seen a procession of big name stars coming forward with their own experiences of sexism, harassment and assault. Taylor Swift won a court case against a radio DJ who groped her while taking a photograph with her. Lily Allen gave a detailed account of a record industry executive sexually assaulting her as she slept, warning that similar abuse is \u201crife\u201d in the music business. Hookworms and also The Orwells broke up after accusations of sexual and psychological abuse surfaced \u2013 though all accused deny the allegations. In February, the New York Times levelled a series of accusations of manipulative behaviour at Ryan Adams, who allegedly \u201cdangled career opportunities while simultaneously pursuing female artists for sex\u201d. Adams apologised to anyone hurt but denied all allegations. The Brit awards\u2019 organising body, the British Phonographic Industry, encouraged attendees at the 2018 ceremony to wear a white rose pin \u201cas a symbol of solidarity\u201d, without specifically mentioning a cause in a move that was widely criticised. Vick Bain, a former chief executive of the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors, said the industry should \u201cbe focused on creating meaningful change\u201d, while Paul Pacifico, chief executive of the Association of Independent Music, said he appreciated the gesture \u201cbut we already know there is a problem\u201d. There has been progress on gender parity at some music festivals, with Primavera Sounds in Barcelona achieving a 50/50 split. \u201cIt\u2019s not difficult once your mind is set,\u201d said Primavera\u2019s Marta Pallares Olivares. After research revealed that 80% of festival lineups were male, 45 events pledged to have gender parity on their lineups by 2022. Last weekend saw the Hear Her festival take place in Poole, which featured an all-female line-up of artists from across a spectrum of folk, pop and indie rock. Several TV shows including Glow, The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, Fleabag, The Good Fight, Catastrophe and Silicon Valley have all dedicated storylines to the subject of #MeToo. Dan Reed\u2019s Leaving Neverland made new allegations about Michael Jackson abusing two young boys in the 1990s, while the documentary Surviving R Kelly detailed decades of alleged abuse by the R\u2019n\u2019B singer who is currently awaiting trial and denies the allegations. In Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon\u2019s forthcoming Apple TV project, The Morning Show, the host of a popular chat show is sacked after sexual misconduct. HBO, meanwhile, introduced intimacy co-ordinators, such as Alicia Rodis who joined David Simon\u2019s 1970s porn and prostitution show The Deuce. These are employed to ensure actors aren\u2019t \u201cleft fumbling in the dark\u201d when trying not to cross boundaries during sex scenes. The practice has now become widespread, with immersive theatre shows such as The Wolf of Wall Street also employing intimacy co-ordinators to protect actors. \u201cThis is a long-term project and is something that people will have to keep working on all the time,\u201d said Silverstein. \u201cSocial change is not linear.\u201d",

Rife with power, gender, race and class imbalances, the aid sector has long been a hotbed of abuse and misconduct, with an estimated 86% of aid workers claiming to have a colleague who has suffered sexual violence on the job. Yet the flurry of action surrounding the 2018 revelations of sexual misconduct at two of Britain\u2019s best known charities, Oxfam and Save the Children, seemed to promise a clean up of the sector. Hundreds of staff from international charities were dismissed for inappropriate behaviour; conferences and summits held to establish industry-wide codes of conduct and safeguarding principles; millions of pounds pledged on a global register to prevent abusers from working in aid; and calls made for an independent aid ombudsman to support survivors. But has anything actually changed on the ground? According to ethics expert Dr Suzanne Shale, who authored last year\u2019s report into workplace culture at Save the Children UK in the wake of allegations of harassment and abuse at the charity, #MeToo (and the corresponding movement #AidToo) \u201chas given momentum to a process of change which may have been in the works in some charities but was most definitely not on the agenda in others\u201d. Some of this change can be seen in the way the aid sector has been forced to become increasingly transparent about the number of safeguarding and sexual exploitation incidents taking place, said chief executive Stephanie Draper of Bond, the UK network for more than 400 international development NGOs. \u201cThankfully, due to improved reporting, we are seeing more women and girls feeling safe and confident enough to speak out, and we are seeing more potential exploiters called out or excluded from our sector.\u201d But not everyone feels safe to come forward, says Shaista Aziz, co-founder of the NGO Safe Space, an intersectional feminist platform seeking accountability over #AidToo abuse. \u201cMany women who want to make complaints are still being told they\u2019re feeding into a right-wing, anti-aid agenda.

Naik described the nature of the 2019 sex-for-aid allegations as \u201calmost a repeat of the 2002 report\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to keep funding policy and guidelines \u2013 this has been happening since 2002 \u2013 what you need is implementation: support for front-liners so that they can tell beneficiaries about their rights, listen to them and act on their complaints.

Speaking two years after press reports first detailed abuse by Weinstein, his former assistant and theatre producer, Zelda Perkins, and Bafta-award-winning actor Rosanna Arquette, hailed a \u201cprofound transformation\u201d but told the Guardian there were likely more revelations to come about high-profile men abusing their positions. In October 2017, stories in the New York Times and the New Yorker prompted thousands of women to come forward with their accounts of sexual harassment and assault against a wide variety of perpetrators under the hashtag #MeToo. The movement had a far-reaching impact on how industries \u2013 from the arts to politics and business \u2013 dealt with allegations of abuse. \u201cI think [the Weinstein accusations] are the tip of the iceberg in what we are going to see and what will be revealed in the future \u2013 as we\u2019ve just seen from Jeffrey Epstein and his horrible network that\u2019s connected to so many powerful men worldwide,\u201d said Arquette, who has alleged that the Miramax co-founder sexually assaulted her in the early nineties. Perkins worked for Miramax in the 1990s and signed a non-disclosure agreement after she left the company when a colleague said they were attacked by Weinstein. She also said there were more stories to come about powerful men who have abused their positions. \u201c[Men like Weinstein] are everywhere and ultimately my call has not been so much about punishing these individuals \u2013 there are always going to be these individuals,\u201d she said. \u201cThe real issue is that society and the system needs to change because currently the systems all work in favour of the powerful.\u201d Weinstein will face criminal trial in January 2020 for charges including rape and predatory sexual assault, all of which he has pleaded not guilty to. More than 80 women have alleged sexual misconduct by the producer over a period of four decades. Both Arquette and Perkins said that while the publications of allegations against Weinstein had provoked some change for the better, they had not seen as much progress as they would have hoped for. \u201cIt has been a profound transformation,\u201d said Arquette. \u201cIt\u2019s a massive worldwide wake-up call to men in particular to change their bad behaviour on a fundamental level.\u201d But she added: \u201cThere are very, very powerful men in our business who feel sorry for him and that he lost his career and continue to behind the scenes figure out a way to support him.\u201d Perkins said: \u201cPeople are beginning to speak and the water is stirring, but I don\u2019t think that the changes are as big as people would have hoped in the two-year period.

      "body": "<p>Until recently, Tricky had a picture of his mother as the screensaver on his phone. He never got to know her properly \u2013 she killed herself when he was just four years old \u2013 but he had gone through life believing that she was out there, somewhere, keeping an eye on him.</p> <p>\u201cAnd I did believe that,\u201d he says. \u201cUntil 8 May this year. Because that was the day my world ended. So if she was supposed to be looking after me, what the fuck\u2019s happened?\u201d</p> <p>The date he is referring to is the day his daughter Mazy \u2013 also known as Mina \u2013 died at the age of 24 (there is currently an ongoing NHS trust inquiry into the cause). At the time of her death, Tricky put out a brief statement saying: \u201cI thought I knew what loss was, but now my daughter is gone I realise I had no idea what it was after all.\u201d</p> <p>Today, several months on, he still sounds utterly bereft: \u201cI\u2019ve lost my belief,\u201d he says at one point. \u201cHopefully I will get it back.\u201d</p> <p>He is here to talk about his autobiography, and you wouldn\u2019t, on the surface, know that he was grieving. We are sitting at an outdoor bar alongside Regent\u2019s canal in north London. Tricky is drinking \u201cwater with bubbles\u201d and smoking rollups. He is outgoing, cheeky and full of warmth. He speaks with a thick Bristolian burr, loudly and quickly, a surprise to people who have heard his music \u2013 which can be dark and claustrophobic \u2013 and expect a moody personality to match.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ebaa9bef16ef1e33766fe1bccc1eb2e6d745605c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ebaa9bef16ef1e33766fe1bccc1eb2e6d745605c/0_466_1527_1481/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tricky as a child in Bristol.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"970\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tricky as a child in Bristol.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Tricky</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The memoir charts Tricky\u2019s unlikely rise from young Bristol tearaway to one of British music\u2019s most creative visionaries. His hushed style of rapping, unusual production methods and ability to reconstruct soul, punk, reggae and hip-hop into strange new shapes has long left critics scrabbling for words to define his 13-album career. He hates being called \u201cthe godfather of trip-hop\u201d \u2013 hates the phrase \u201ctrip-hop\u201d, in fact \u2013 but it is probably as close as you will get to a neat label and it is hard to argue with.</p> <p>Tricky shaped the sound of Massive Attack\u2019s landmark 1991 album Blue Lines, and four years later \u2013 thanks in part to the beguiling vocals of his then partner and the mother of Mazy, Martina Topley-Bird \u2013 changed the face of pop with his baffling, beautiful debut solo album, Maxinquaye, named after his mother.</p> <p>The book\u2019s title \u2013 Hell Is Round the Corner \u2013 is taken from a track on Maxinquaye, and it aptly describes a life in which violence and tragedy have lurked beside every success story. Born Adrian Thaws and raised in Bristol by his grandmother and aunties, Tricky had a happy, but unconventional, childhood: food often consisted of rabbit stew sourced from the family\u2019s poaching expeditions; criminality was an accepted way of life.</p> <p>Without his musical gift, Tricky\u2019s prospects would not have looked bright: \u201cWhere I come from, a lot of people are either on drugs, in prison or dead,\u201d he says. His uncles were gangsters and Tricky grew up noticing how people would treat him differently whenever their names were dropped: his food in a curry house would be upgraded; the atmosphere in a pub might suddenly change.</p> <p>\u201cOnce, I asked my auntie why everyone was scared of my uncle Martin,\u201d he says. \u201cShe said: \u2018Because if he says he\u2019s going to cut your throat, he\u2019ll cut your throat.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>He saw unimaginable violence from a young age. Several social workers, including his other daughter, Marie, have read his book, and told him that the way he was brought up would, in their professional eyes, count as neglect.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6d1b3ecba1a6ddc8b25d93f2f4487ecfe3c82358\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6d1b3ecba1a6ddc8b25d93f2f4487ecfe3c82358/0_0_5270_3162/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Massive Attack with Tricky in concert, SOBs, New York City, 30 October 1991.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Massive Attack with Tricky in concert, SOBs, New York City, 30 October 1991.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alice Arnold/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But that is not how he sees it. He loved life in Bristol\u2019s Knowle West, a tough, predominantly white neighbourhood, and says his upbringing was full of affection. Still, you can see where the social workers are coming from. His grandmother would often say things like: \u201c\u2018Oh, it\u2019s cold today, you don\u2019t wanna go school, stay at home with me.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>She would also tell him to always empty his pockets before going out, in case he accidentally left something behind at a crime scene. \u201cWhat I consider normal ain\u2019t really normal,\u201d he concedes.</p> <p>Perhaps the most startling example of this in the book is when he introduces a character from his youth as a \u201clovely guy\u201d and then, a paragraph or so later, breezily mentions that said character had also shot someone in the neck. Tricky pauses when I mention this, as if trying to work out who I\u2019m on about. Then he breaks out in an explosion of affection: \u201cOh, Wayney Lomas! Yeah! Aw, Wayney was a <em>brilliant</em> guy! But yeah, he got found with his head chopped off. They shot him in the head, in his house, then took his body, chopped him up and put him in a concrete floor.\u201d</p> <p>Er \u2026 who did?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"044bdb9d2b70faf95229afacc63f913740862248\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/044bdb9d2b70faf95229afacc63f913740862248/0_0_1943_3152/616.jpg\" alt=\"Tricky\u2019s mum, Maxinquaye.\" width=\"616\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tricky\u2019s mum, Maxine Quaye.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Tricky</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThey don\u2019t know who did it. But he was a lovely, <em>lovely</em> guy. But yeah, he\u2019d shot someone in the neck, apparently.\u201d</p> <p>He checks my startled reaction to this tale and laughs. Is it any wonder, he says, that his music can sound dark to some people? Darkness is what he has always known. His first memory is peeking into his mum\u2019s coffin while it was resting in the family home before burial. Didn\u2019t that mess with his head a bit? \u201cI don\u2019t think it would be a great thing, would it?\u201d</p> <p>The men in his life were tough guys, but the women who raised him were tougher. He saw his grandmother and aunties street-fight like his uncles (\u201cThe fighting was more vicious, cos men care more about their ego\u201d) and observed them being strong in other ways, too: running the household and feeding the family while the men were away doing time.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve a kinship with women,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019ve always put women in strong positions in music.\u201d</p> <p>Topley-Bird was the most important of these. He met her by sheer luck in about 1992 \u2013 she had been singing with schoolfriends outside his house. A few years later, they became a couple and had Mazy together; the relationship didn\u2019t last, but they continued to collaborate musically on several more albums.</p> <p>That music as restless and ruthlessly experimental as Tricky\u2019s found commercial success is perhaps surprising, not least to him. He expected to be an underground producer \u2013 instead Maxinquaye went to No 3, and was followed by a string of Top 40 albums. His sound became hugely influential and he was sought after by everyone from David Bowie to U2. Everyone wanted to be associated with him \u2013 even Samantha Cameron claimed to have spent time hanging out with him while she was at university in Bristol (Tricky has always remained sceptical of this, saying he has no recollection of her).</p> <p>But he didn\u2019t enjoy being in the limelight. A tempestuous relationship with Bj\u00f6rk turned him into a tabloid fixture for a while, and he increasingly tried to self-sabotage his career. One time, in New York, he failed to turn up to a meeting in his hotel with Madonna because he wanted to sleep instead. He was also terrible when it came to money. He knows that he once owned a house in New Jersey with acres of land around it, but he can\u2019t remember where exactly it was, how it got sold or where the cash went.</p> <p>His mental state wasn\u2019t helped by the amount of weed he was smoking, while he believes candida \u2013 a yeast infection rarely taken seriously by conventional doctors \u2013 was largely responsible for some of his more erratic behaviour. Even without these problems, the spotlight of fame didn\u2019t suit him.

You should never make someone too scared of you.\u201d</p> <p>Processing emotions has never been easy for Tricky. He admits he was a terrible, absent boyfriend to Bj\u00f6rk.

His adoration for her is so clear and, now, so heartbreaking.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the biggest problems with my daughter is that I\u2019ve never loved anybody that much before,\u201d he says. \u201cI was there at her birth.

      "bodyText": "Until recently, Tricky had a picture of his mother as the screensaver on his phone. He never got to know her properly \u2013 she killed herself when he was just four years old \u2013 but he had gone through life believing that she was out there, somewhere, keeping an eye on him. \u201cAnd I did believe that,\u201d he says. \u201cUntil 8 May this year. Because that was the day my world ended. So if she was supposed to be looking after me, what the fuck\u2019s happened?\u201d The date he is referring to is the day his daughter Mazy \u2013 also known as Mina \u2013 died at the age of 24 (there is currently an ongoing NHS trust inquiry into the cause). At the time of her death, Tricky put out a brief statement saying: \u201cI thought I knew what loss was, but now my daughter is gone I realise I had no idea what it was after all.\u201d Today, several months on, he still sounds utterly bereft: \u201cI\u2019ve lost my belief,\u201d he says at one point. \u201cHopefully I will get it back.\u201d He is here to talk about his autobiography, and you wouldn\u2019t, on the surface, know that he was grieving. We are sitting at an outdoor bar alongside Regent\u2019s canal in north London. Tricky is drinking \u201cwater with bubbles\u201d and smoking rollups. He is outgoing, cheeky and full of warmth. He speaks with a thick Bristolian burr, loudly and quickly, a surprise to people who have heard his music \u2013 which can be dark and claustrophobic \u2013 and expect a moody personality to match. The memoir charts Tricky\u2019s unlikely rise from young Bristol tearaway to one of British music\u2019s most creative visionaries. His hushed style of rapping, unusual production methods and ability to reconstruct soul, punk, reggae and hip-hop into strange new shapes has long left critics scrabbling for words to define his 13-album career. He hates being called \u201cthe godfather of trip-hop\u201d \u2013 hates the phrase \u201ctrip-hop\u201d, in fact \u2013 but it is probably as close as you will get to a neat label and it is hard to argue with. Tricky shaped the sound of Massive Attack\u2019s landmark 1991 album Blue Lines, and four years later \u2013 thanks in part to the beguiling vocals of his then partner and the mother of Mazy, Martina Topley-Bird \u2013 changed the face of pop with his baffling, beautiful debut solo album, Maxinquaye, named after his mother. The book\u2019s title \u2013 Hell Is Round the Corner \u2013 is taken from a track on Maxinquaye, and it aptly describes a life in which violence and tragedy have lurked beside every success story. Born Adrian Thaws and raised in Bristol by his grandmother and aunties, Tricky had a happy, but unconventional, childhood: food often consisted of rabbit stew sourced from the family\u2019s poaching expeditions; criminality was an accepted way of life. Without his musical gift, Tricky\u2019s prospects would not have looked bright: \u201cWhere I come from, a lot of people are either on drugs, in prison or dead,\u201d he says. His uncles were gangsters and Tricky grew up noticing how people would treat him differently whenever their names were dropped: his food in a curry house would be upgraded; the atmosphere in a pub might suddenly change. \u201cOnce, I asked my auntie why everyone was scared of my uncle Martin,\u201d he says. \u201cShe said: \u2018Because if he says he\u2019s going to cut your throat, he\u2019ll cut your throat.\u2019\u201d He saw unimaginable violence from a young age. Several social workers, including his other daughter, Marie, have read his book, and told him that the way he was brought up would, in their professional eyes, count as neglect. But that is not how he sees it. He loved life in Bristol\u2019s Knowle West, a tough, predominantly white neighbourhood, and says his upbringing was full of affection. Still, you can see where the social workers are coming from. His grandmother would often say things like: \u201c\u2018Oh, it\u2019s cold today, you don\u2019t wanna go school, stay at home with me.\u2019\u201d She would also tell him to always empty his pockets before going out, in case he accidentally left something behind at a crime scene. \u201cWhat I consider normal ain\u2019t really normal,\u201d he concedes. Perhaps the most startling example of this in the book is when he introduces a character from his youth as a \u201clovely guy\u201d and then, a paragraph or so later, breezily mentions that said character had also shot someone in the neck. Tricky pauses when I mention this, as if trying to work out who I\u2019m on about. Then he breaks out in an explosion of affection: \u201cOh, Wayney Lomas! Yeah! Aw, Wayney was a brilliant guy! But yeah, he got found with his head chopped off. They shot him in the head, in his house, then took his body, chopped him up and put him in a concrete floor.\u201d Er \u2026 who did? \u201cThey don\u2019t know who did it. But he was a lovely, lovely guy. But yeah, he\u2019d shot someone in the neck, apparently.\u201d He checks my startled reaction to this tale and laughs. Is it any wonder, he says, that his music can sound dark to some people? Darkness is what he has always known. His first memory is peeking into his mum\u2019s coffin while it was resting in the family home before burial. Didn\u2019t that mess with his head a bit? \u201cI don\u2019t think it would be a great thing, would it?\u201d The men in his life were tough guys, but the women who raised him were tougher. He saw his grandmother and aunties street-fight like his uncles (\u201cThe fighting was more vicious, cos men care more about their ego\u201d) and observed them being strong in other ways, too: running the household and feeding the family while the men were away doing time. \u201cI\u2019ve a kinship with women,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019ve always put women in strong positions in music.\u201d Topley-Bird was the most important of these. He met her by sheer luck in about 1992 \u2013 she had been singing with schoolfriends outside his house. A few years later, they became a couple and had Mazy together; the relationship didn\u2019t last, but they continued to collaborate musically on several more albums. That music as restless and ruthlessly experimental as Tricky\u2019s found commercial success is perhaps surprising, not least to him. He expected to be an underground producer \u2013 instead Maxinquaye went to No 3, and was followed by a string of Top 40 albums. His sound became hugely influential and he was sought after by everyone from David Bowie to U2. Everyone wanted to be associated with him \u2013 even Samantha Cameron claimed to have spent time hanging out with him while she was at university in Bristol (Tricky has always remained sceptical of this, saying he has no recollection of her). But he didn\u2019t enjoy being in the limelight. A tempestuous relationship with Bj\u00f6rk turned him into a tabloid fixture for a while, and he increasingly tried to self-sabotage his career. One time, in New York, he failed to turn up to a meeting in his hotel with Madonna because he wanted to sleep instead. He was also terrible when it came to money. He knows that he once owned a house in New Jersey with acres of land around it, but he can\u2019t remember where exactly it was, how it got sold or where the cash went. His mental state wasn\u2019t helped by the amount of weed he was smoking, while he believes candida \u2013 a yeast infection rarely taken seriously by conventional doctors \u2013 was largely responsible for some of his more erratic behaviour. Even without these problems, the spotlight of fame didn\u2019t suit him. His subdued rapping style comes, he says, from shyness; the same goes for his live shows, which use minimal stage lighting: \u201cIt\u2019s all lack of confidence This proved to be an issue in 2011, when Tricky was invited by Beyonc\u00e9 to appear as a guest vocalist for her headline set at Glastonbury. He says he wanted to say no, but his manager insisted, so he wrote a verse to perform during her song Baby Boy. When he got on stage and saw the lights, huge crowd and celebrity faces \u2013 Chris Martin, Jay Z \u2013 staring back at him, he froze. \u201cI wasn\u2019t ready for it \u2026 it was too much,\u201d he says. \u201cI told the press that my mic wasn\u2019t working, but it was working fine.\u201d Anxiety has sometimes overcome him in more destructive ways. In his book, he talks about living in Los Angeles in the 00s, when he would keep an Uzisubmachine gun underneath his bed for protection. Would he have been prepared to use it? \u201cThis ain\u2019t bad-guy talk, cos I\u2019m not a bad guy,\u201d he says. \u201cBut people don\u2019t realise what fear can do.

It makes you sick, it makes you mentally ill.\u201d He continues: \u201cSo I had this person \u2013 I can\u2019t tell you who \u2013 on my mind day and night.

Here are the key moments ahead:</p> <h2><strong>Monday</strong></h2> <p>The Queen\u2019s speech, outlining the government\u2019s plans for legislation, will include details of the withdrawal agreement bill, to be voted on if the EU agrees to a Brexit deal this week. Among the other 22 bills are tougher sentences for violent and sexual offences and scrapping the current rail franchise system. The Scottish National party conference continues in Aberdeen.</p> <h2><strong>Tuesday</strong></h2> <p>MPs debate the Queen\u2019s speech, which can take up to five days before a vote is held. The chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, will meet EU ministers before the European council summit on Thursday. Agenda papers say he will discuss the \u201cstate of play regarding Brexit\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>Thursday</strong></h2> <p>The EU summit begins in Brussels. Johnson and his team will attend, but it may already have become clear by that point whether a deal is doable. A fourth day of debate of the Queen\u2019s speech will he be held in the Commons.</p> <p>With parliament not scheduled to sit on Friday, Thursday would be the government\u2019s last chance to table a motion scheduling a Saturday session in the House of Commons.</p> <h2><strong>Friday</strong></h2> <p>The EU summit continues with Brexit talks, which is the last item on the agenda \u2013 and may turn its attention to the length of a potential extension.</p> <h2><strong>Saturday</strong></h2> <p>The first time the Commons meets on a Saturday since the Falklands war has been labelled \u201csuper Saturday\u201d. Johnson will either present an EU-backed Brexit deal or set out his next steps.</p> <p>Under the terms of the Benn act, Johnson should write a letter to the EU requesting an extension if parliament has not approved a Brexit deal by 11pm.</p> <p>It is unclear whether the government will table the full withdrawal agreement implementation bill, which rebel MPs could seek to amend to bring about a referendum, or just a motion setting out the terms of the proposed deal.</p>",

      "bodyText": "After talks between Leo Varadkar and Boris Johnson prompted a new surge of optimism that a Brexit deal could be reached, intensive talks over the weekend were described by the EU\u2019s chief negotiator Michel Barnier as \u201cdifficult\u201d, suggesting once again that hopes of an agreement were in the balance. Over the next six days, most observers expect that clarity over whether a deal can be done \u2013 or if an extension might be plausible \u2013 will finally arrive. Here are the key moments ahead: Monday The Queen\u2019s speech, outlining the government\u2019s plans for legislation, will include details of the withdrawal agreement bill, to be voted on if the EU agrees to a Brexit deal this week. Among the other 22 bills are tougher sentences for violent and sexual offences and scrapping the current rail franchise system. The Scottish National party conference continues in Aberdeen. Tuesday MPs debate the Queen\u2019s speech, which can take up to five days before a vote is held. The chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, will meet EU ministers before the European council summit on Thursday. Agenda papers say he will discuss the \u201cstate of play regarding Brexit\u201d. Thursday The EU summit begins in Brussels. Johnson and his team will attend, but it may already have become clear by that point whether a deal is doable. A fourth day of debate of the Queen\u2019s speech will he be held in the Commons. With parliament not scheduled to sit on Friday, Thursday would be the government\u2019s last chance to table a motion scheduling a Saturday session in the House of Commons. Friday The EU summit continues with Brexit talks, which is the last item on the agenda \u2013 and may turn its attention to the length of a potential extension. Saturday The first time the Commons meets on a Saturday since the Falklands war has been labelled \u201csuper Saturday\u201d. Johnson will either present an EU-backed Brexit deal or set out his next steps. Under the terms of the Benn act, Johnson should write a letter to the EU requesting an extension if parliament has not approved a Brexit deal by 11pm. It is unclear whether the government will table the full withdrawal agreement implementation bill, which rebel MPs could seek to amend to bring about a referendum, or just a motion setting out the terms of the proposed deal.",

For example, while the rum producer Bacardi acknowledges that drinking in pregnancy is \u201crisky\u201d, it also claims that \u201cwhat is \u2018too much\u2019 may vary by individual\u201d, even though this contradicts existing evidence.</p> <p>Others were \u201cambiguous\u201d about the risks involved, which also include the child being small for its gestational age. For instance, <a href=\"http://educalcool.qc.ca/en/\">Educ\u2019alcool</a>, an industry-backed body in Canada, maintains that \u201c[the] risk to the foetus is reduced considerably if you have only one drink every now and then\u201d.</p> <p>The government and four UK home nations\u2019 chief medical officers\u2019 joint view is that women should avoid alcohol completely while they are pregnant.</p> <p>The findings are published in the <a href=\"https://www.jsad.com/\">Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs</a>. The academics analysed information about alcohol and pregnancy issued by 23 firms such as Heineken and Diageo and industry-funded bodiesin six countries: Britain, Ireland, the US, Australia, New Zealand and Canada. They then compared that to material published by public health bodies and authorities.</p> <p>Information published by the industry sources studied often did not mention the need for total abstention and instead used language that endorsed continuing to consume some alcohol. Some ignored, downplayed or sparked confusion about the scientific basis of official advice.</p> <p>Prof Mark Petticrew of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, the lead author, said: \u201cAcross alcohol industry-funded organisations there appears to be a consistent strategy to the delivery of information on alcohol consumption and pregnancy. One possible reason is that women are a crucial part of the alcohol market. Pregnancy, therefore, may represent a significant commercial threat to the alcohol industry.</p> <p>\u201cThis study provides further evidence that these organisations pose a potential risk to public health, specifically to the health of pregnant women and the baby, and should have no role in disseminating health information.\u201d</p> <p>The paper says that: \u201cThe strategies outlined (omission, framing and linguistic ambiguities) may reflect the alcohol industry\u2019s protection of the female market, with the common goal of \u2018nudging\u2019 women towards continuing to drink during pregnancy.\u201d</p> <p>The researchers accuse Drinkaware of several dubious practices. For example, it gives accurate information about how alcohol crosses the placenta but then confuses matters by adding: \u201cHow a baby will be affected depends on how much its mother drinks and the mother\u2019s metabolism. Evidence suggests that diet is also important, with poor maternal nutrition increasing the risk of harm to the unborn baby.\u201d</p> <p>In addition, Drinkaware\u2019s advice on pregnancy, breastfeeding, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/apr/04/my-mother-the-alcoholic-living-with-foetal-alcohol-syndrome\">foetal alcohol syndrome</a> and fertility are the last four sections of a 45-section area of its website, which means anyone wanting to read it has to scroll through nine pages of other information. It also states that \u201cit can be hard to know where to go for trustworthy advice \u2026 especially \u2026 when it comes to advice about drinking alcohol when you\u2019re pregnant.\u201d</p> <p>Katherine Severi, chief executive of the Institute of Alcohol Studies, a thinktank that is independent of the industry, said: \u201cIt\u2019s worrying to think pregnant women might be putting themselves at greater risk of health problems due to an information vacuum. Alcohol companies are not medical experts, they are experts in selling alcohol.\u201d</p> <p>She called for labels warning pregnant women not to drink to become compulsory on all alcoholic products and ministers to fund public awareness campaigns about the risks involved.</p> <p>Prof Sir Ian Gilmore, the chair of the Alcohol Health Alliance UK, claimed the industry was \u201cdistorting information available to alcohol consumers; putting the health of both mothers and babies at serious risk.

      "bodyText": "Alcohol firms and bodies they fund are encouraging women to drink in pregnancy \u2013 putting their unborn child in danger \u2013 by publishing false and misleading information about the risks involved, new research claims. The alcohol industry is ignoring scientific evidence as part of a drive to \u201cnudge\u201d mothers-to-be into drinking as part of a deliberate strategy to ensure women keep consuming their products because young people are turning away from them, researchers say. Industry bodies globally are casting doubt on government health advice to abstain from alcohol altogether during pregnancy, and misrepresenting evidence showing that drinking then can lead to the baby suffering brain damage or congenital abnormalities or being born prematurely. Alcohol producers and social responsibility organisations they fund such as Drinkaware in the UK are publishing information on websites and apps that says \u201clight drinking\u201d in pregnancy is safe, or denying that consumption is linked to a baby having foetal alcohol spectrum disorder. Some of the sources of information that the British researchers studied promote the idea that certain women may be able to keep drinking some alcohol while expecting. For example, while the rum producer Bacardi acknowledges that drinking in pregnancy is \u201crisky\u201d, it also claims that \u201cwhat is \u2018too much\u2019 may vary by individual\u201d, even though this contradicts existing evidence. Others were \u201cambiguous\u201d about the risks involved, which also include the child being small for its gestational age. For instance, Educ\u2019alcool, an industry-backed body in Canada, maintains that \u201c[the] risk to the foetus is reduced considerably if you have only one drink every now and then\u201d. The government and four UK home nations\u2019 chief medical officers\u2019 joint view is that women should avoid alcohol completely while they are pregnant. The findings are published in the Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs. The academics analysed information about alcohol and pregnancy issued by 23 firms such as Heineken and Diageo and industry-funded bodiesin six countries: Britain, Ireland, the US, Australia, New Zealand and Canada. They then compared that to material published by public health bodies and authorities. Information published by the industry sources studied often did not mention the need for total abstention and instead used language that endorsed continuing to consume some alcohol. Some ignored, downplayed or sparked confusion about the scientific basis of official advice. Prof Mark Petticrew of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, the lead author, said: \u201cAcross alcohol industry-funded organisations there appears to be a consistent strategy to the delivery of information on alcohol consumption and pregnancy. One possible reason is that women are a crucial part of the alcohol market. Pregnancy, therefore, may represent a significant commercial threat to the alcohol industry. \u201cThis study provides further evidence that these organisations pose a potential risk to public health, specifically to the health of pregnant women and the baby, and should have no role in disseminating health information.\u201d The paper says that: \u201cThe strategies outlined (omission, framing and linguistic ambiguities) may reflect the alcohol industry\u2019s protection of the female market, with the common goal of \u2018nudging\u2019 women towards continuing to drink during pregnancy.\u201d The researchers accuse Drinkaware of several dubious practices. For example, it gives accurate information about how alcohol crosses the placenta but then confuses matters by adding: \u201cHow a baby will be affected depends on how much its mother drinks and the mother\u2019s metabolism. Evidence suggests that diet is also important, with poor maternal nutrition increasing the risk of harm to the unborn baby.\u201d In addition, Drinkaware\u2019s advice on pregnancy, breastfeeding, foetal alcohol syndrome and fertility are the last four sections of a 45-section area of its website, which means anyone wanting to read it has to scroll through nine pages of other information. It also states that \u201cit can be hard to know where to go for trustworthy advice \u2026 especially \u2026 when it comes to advice about drinking alcohol when you\u2019re pregnant.\u201d Katherine Severi, chief executive of the Institute of Alcohol Studies, a thinktank that is independent of the industry, said: \u201cIt\u2019s worrying to think pregnant women might be putting themselves at greater risk of health problems due to an information vacuum. Alcohol companies are not medical experts, they are experts in selling alcohol.\u201d She called for labels warning pregnant women not to drink to become compulsory on all alcoholic products and ministers to fund public awareness campaigns about the risks involved. Prof Sir Ian Gilmore, the chair of the Alcohol Health Alliance UK, claimed the industry was \u201cdistorting information available to alcohol consumers; putting the health of both mothers and babies at serious risk. Misleading information on the safety of alcohol consumption for pregnant woman is likely to contribute to the fact that more than 40% of women in the UK continue to drink during pregnancy and four times as many children have alcohol-related birth defects than the global average.\u201d Drinkaware denied any wrongdoing. A spokesperson said information on its website was \u201ccrystal clear \u2026 that that the safest approach is to not drink at all during pregnancy, or if you\u2019re trying to conceive. It states, for example, that \u2018drinking alcohol at any stage during pregnancy can cause harm to your baby and the more you drink, the greater the risk. \u201cThe information we provide is overseen and verified by an independent medical advisory panel, consisting of highly experienced health professionals.\u201d The Department of Health and Social Care said: \u201cWe have been clear that the alcohol industry must reflect the UK Chief Medical Officers\u2019 alcohol guidelines. They can be reflected simply by a reference to the weekly recommendation of 14 units, the no drinking in pregnancy logo and the Drinkaware logo.\u201d",

In practice, hopes of justice for war crimes victims mainly rely at present on independent, non-government organisations such as Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, the Syria Campaign and the Commission for International Justice and Accountability that collect and document evidence and witness statements that could be used in future prosecutions. Recent history suggests most culprits will escape justice, including the killers now on the rampage around Tel Abyad. But this may be changing. Groundbreaking cases brought in Germany and France this year against alleged Syrian state torturers, which are expected to go to trial, have raised hopes the law is slowly catching up with the lawless.",

On Monday the parliamentary sitting week began with the press gallery receiving the full set of notes from the PMO after it was sent to them by accident. We\u2019ve fact checked the document to see just how many untruths or misleading claims are in the brief. Labor\u2019s taxes Claim: \u201cLabor may have changed their leader but they haven\u2019t changed their policies.\u201d Fact: Anthony Albanese has said all Labor policies are under review and it won\u2019t be held to 2019 election policies unless it recommits to them before the next election. Claim: \u201cLabor is still the party of $387 billion of higher taxes.\u201d Fact: At the 2019 election Labor proposed about $157bn of new taxes or cuts to existing tax breaks over a decade, but the Coalition claim is inflated by counting $230bn of income tax cuts Labor at first opposed but then helped the government pass in full. Newstart Claim: \u201cAbout two-thirds of those granted Newstart get off the payment within 12 months.\u201d Fact: This statistic only refers to new recipients coming on to the payment in a given year. The average time a person spends on Newstart is three years, according to government data. At March 2019, 459,007 of the 686,328 people on Newstart had been on the payment for more than 12 months. Claim: Newstart \u201cis already increased twice a year, every year in line with CPI which is a widely accepted measure of changes to cost of living.\u201d Fact: Other payments like the aged pension are benchmarked to wages, which have increased more quickly. Newstart would be about $75 a week more if it had risen with wages since the mid-1990s. Claim: \u201cWelfare cost more than $172 billion in 2018-19, representing more than one in three dollars or 35% of all spending by the government.\u201d Fact: The largest part of the welfare spend is the aged pension. The budget papers show assistance to the aged was $67bn last financial year. Assistance for the unemployed and the sick, which includes Newstart, is about $10bn. Drought Claim: \u201cThe support package we announced last week will deliver nearly $100 million to drought-hit communities, which is on top of more than $7 billion in drought support funding already provided by the government.\u201d Fact: Most of the $7bn has not been spent. The bulk of the figure is attributable to the government\u2019s $5bn Future Drought Fund, which was established with $3.9bn and will grow with earnings reinvested until the balance reaches $5bn, which is expected to be achieved in 2028-29. Nothing has been spent from the $5bn fund yet \u2013 it starts making disbursements from 1 July next year, with $100m being paid each year to support Australian farmers and communities to become more prepared for, and resilient to, the effects of drought. Claim: \u201cThe federal government has a national drought policy and it was outlined following the national drought summit the government convened last year.\u201d Fact: The National Farmers Federation and experts such as Prof Linda Botterill have suggested the current suite of policies do not constitute a national drought policy because they are ad hoc, not sufficiently evidence-based and do not include the states. The NFF president, Fiona Simson, has said the question of how to deal with future droughts is \u201csomething that successive governments now have shirked \u2013 the task of actually putting in place policy that\u2019s going to give people confidence not just when we\u2019re in the grips of drought but when preparing for drought.\u201d Meeting our 2030 Paris targets Claim: \u201cWe\u2019re taking meaningful action to reduce global emissions with our $3.5 billion Climate Solutions Package that will deliver the 328 million tonnes of abatement needed to meet our 2030 Paris target.\u201d Fact: Australia\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions are still rising and numerous experts and international bodies including the United Nations have warned it is not on track to meet the target of a 26-28% reduction by 2030. The government is counting on a 367 megatonne abatement from carryover credits for beating the Kyoto targets \u2013 which could be a source of contention in international negotiations \u2013 as well as just under 100Mt of abatement from \u201ctechnology solutions\u201d \u2013 which aren\u2019t specified in the roadmap \u2013 and emissions reduction from an electric vehicle strategy that it has not yet unveiled. Religious discrimination bill Claim: \u201cThe bill does not create a positive right to freedom of religion.\u201d Fact: While the core of the bill creates a freedom from discrimination, numerous clauses also give religious people new positive rights including: the ability to make religious statements that breach other discrimination laws or employer codes of conduct; and a right for medical practitioners to refuse to treat people on the grounds of religion. Claim: The bill \u201cdoes not prioritise freedom of religion over other rights.\u201d Fact: The bill overrides state and federal discrimination laws, ensuring that statements of religious belief receive greater protection than other protected attributes such as sex, race, age and disability. Statements of belief are protected if they \u201cmay reasonably be regarded\u201d as in accordance with a person\u2019s religious beliefs, but the statements of non-religious people must \u201carise directly\u201d from the fact the person does not hold a religious belief to receive protection. Claim: The bill \u201cdoes not authorise or enable hate speech, harassment or vilification.\u201d Fact: While statements of religious belief that are \u201cmalicious, would harass, vilify or incite hatred or violence\u201d would still be banned, the bill would override section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act and Tasmanian anti-discrimination law, which prohibit statements that \u201coffend, insult or humiliate\u201d people based on protected grounds. Medevac legislation Claim: \u201cProcesses for medical transfer already exist and are effective.\u201d Fact: Before medevac provisions were legislated, the home affairs department policy stated that requests for evacuation \u201cwill only be considered \u2026 where the person faces a life-threatening medical emergency that would otherwise result in their death or permanent, significant disability\u201d. The policy, introduced in 2015, resulted in a sharp decrease in medical evacuations. The Australian Human Rights Commission has told a parliamentary inquiry that since March 2018 the federal court ordered medical transfers in 96 cases and a further 220 people were transferred after threats of legal proceedings. Of the 536 people brought to Australia in 2018-19 approximately 60% were transferred due to actual or prospective litigation, which strongly indicates the previous regime was not sufficient to ensure proper care. Claim: \u201cIt is a misconception that [medevac provisions] introduced \u2018doctors\u2019 into the medical transfer process. It did not. The department has consistently relied on clinical advice from doctors to form decisions on whether to bring a person to Australia for medical treatment.\u201d Fact: The medevac provisions created a specialist medical panel to approve transfers under advice from doctors rather than government officials.

Claim: \u201cThe need for medical transfers to third countries, including Australia, reduced as medical capacity and treatment options became more readily available in Papua New Guinea and Nauru.\u201d Fact: Doctors responsible for medevac health assessments have found that of 581 people in detention they have audited 97% have significant physical health issues and 91% have serious mental health issues. Asylum seekers arriving by plane Claim: \u201cIn the last three years that Labor was in office, 6,900 permanent protection visas were granted by Labor to people who arrived by air.\u201d Fact: According to immigration department statistics, cited by the shadow immigration minister, Kristina Keneally, in her own fact check on Twitter, 4,548 protection visas were granted to asylum seekers who did not arrive by boat between 2010-11 and 2012-13.

      "bodyText": "Fan culture works in mysterious ways, but for a band as popular and influential as U2 have been over four decades, it seems only natural that a whole academic discipline has emerged to study them. The inaugural Australian edition of the U2 Conference \u2013 part symposium for researchers in the robust field of U2 studies, part fan gathering \u2013 will take place in Sydney in November, to coincide with the Irish superstars bringing their Joshua Tree tour to local shores. \u201cThe band has so much meaning to so many people,\u201d Naomi Dinnen, organiser for November\u2019s conference and an academic at Australian National University\u2019s school of music, told Guardian Australia. \u201cThat\u2019s why we wanted to do this conference \u2013 to bring people together to look at how [U2 has] really influenced society, culture and music over the last 40 years. It\u2019s actually been huge.\u201d The conference is the brainchild of US literary academic Scott Calhoun. Three editions of the conference have run in the past \u2013 in 2009 and 2013 in the US, and last year in the pop band\u2019s home town of Dublin, Ireland. Australian film director Richard Lowenstein, behind the recent Michael Hutchence documentary, Mystify, will be a special guest at the conference. A friend of both Hutchence and U2 frontman Bono, Lowenstein\u2019s association with U2 goes back to his little-known documentary, U2 Lovetown, following the band\u2019s lengthy 1989 Australian tour. The U2 Conference will host screenings of both U2 Lovetown and Mystify, the latter of which includes an interview with Bono. It will be a day without the band itself \u2013 U2\u2019s members are not expected to make an appearance at the conference, except perhaps in the form of indelible ink: in what promises to be a conference highlight, University of North Florida associate professor Beth Nabi will present the results of almost five years of international research documenting hundreds of U2 fan tattoos. With conference attendance capped at 100 guests, Dinnen told Guardian Australia she hoped the Sydney event would attract a local audience who wanted to be part of the conversation around U2\u2019s work. \u201cWithin academia, pop music is a relatively new discipline,\u201d Dinnen said. \u201cBecause U2 were so big in America there was a lot of focus on the theological aspect [of their music] in the 80s.\u201d Academics in U2 studies have since looked at the band as a cultural phenomenon and how they\u2019ve changed or influenced concert culture, but there hadn\u2019t been a lot of study into the musicology of the band\u2019s work, she said. The Sydney resident and former music journalist had been a fan of U2 \u201csince the beginning\u201d. One of her earliest memories of the band was catching the music video for Gloria on TV in the early 1980s. \u201cThey\u2019ve evolved and changed. They\u2019ve been through so many different stages with their music,\u201d Dinnen said. \u201cThey could just rest on their laurels and write another Beautiful Day, but they seem to be constantly pushing the boundaries and looking for different ways of doing music.\u201d Dinnen\u2019s research focus is on the influence of the Hebrew Bible in U2\u2019s music. The Antipodean leg of U2\u2019s Joshua Tree tour starts in New Zealand on 8 November before making its way to Australia for shows in Brisbane, Melbourne, Adelaide, Sydney and Perth. The U2 Conference: the Australian Edition will take place on 21 November at Studios 301 in Sydney.",

A social media callout to people born after 1988 (none of them were picking up their phone) showed an intense distrust of a phone conversation. Growing up with mobile phones and messaging means a phone call can be viewed an aggressive personal intrusion. A phone call means less time to formulate a response. It means more vulnerability to another person. Yet it would seem those who avoid the phone call are missing out. Professor Barbara Keys from the University of Melbourne wrote in the Conversation: \u201cThe voice is one of our most powerful instruments, designed not only to communicate but also to build intimacy. Our voices convey emotion so effectively that we can identify emotions in speech even when the words themselves are muffled by walls.

That\u2019s certainly the case for new mother Lucille Cutting, 30. \u201cI\u2019ve reverted back to doing them [making phone calls] now that I\u2019m on maternity leave. They\u2019re great for when I go for long walks with the pram and actually have head space for a conversation. It\u2019s like a dose of endorphins, regardless of whether it\u2019s a happy or slightly sad chat.\u201d Gretchen Miller, 51, is a radio-maker who spends a lot of time thinking about sound and communication, and is a fan of the phone D&amp;M. \u201cI still hear the \u2018phone voice\u2019 as intimate. It signifies intimacy for me \u2013 the receiver pressed to the ear, the thin sound of the voice and the depth of the stories ... that all means closeness.\u201d For me, I no longer see a night at home as a gaping chasm of time to be filled with a TV show I\u2019m only half-interested in, sucking on a few pieces of chocolate and getting lost down internet rabbit holes. Tonight, headphones in, a phone call or two means I\u2019ll discover something new about someone I care about, laugh at least three times, reveal something I wouldn\u2019t tell anyone else and maybe even discover a new Liza Minnelli impersonator I\u2019d never heard of. And how bloody cup-filling is that? \u2022 Melanie Tait is a journalist, author and playwright",
