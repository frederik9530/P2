Speaking on Saturday morning, Torra again condemned the violence of recent days, adding: \u201cViolence has never been our flag.\u201d He urged talks with Spain\u2019s acting government \u201cto open a dialogue to find a democratic solution and a political and democratic\u201d way out of the crisis over regional independence. The pro-independence regional president has been criticised for his delay in condemning the violence \u2013 and for calling for civil disobedience before sending police forces in to quell it. His call for talks came two days after he suggested another unilateral independence referendum should be held in response to the imprisonment of nine leaders over their roles in the failed push for secession two years ago. After five consecutive nights of violence in Barcelona, there was a noisy standoff on Saturday night lasting several hours when a large group of peaceful and largely middle-aged protestors sat down in front of a line of riot police vans to prevent younger protestors from attacking the police. Behind them, hundreds of young people, many with their faces covered, milled around, waiting for the peaceful protesters to disperse, while others set up barricades and taunted police on the other side of the square. Police fired rubber bullets to disperse protesters. There was an exceptionally heavy police presence on all the streets leading to Pla\u00e7a d\u2019Urquinaona, the focus of the worst of Friday night\u2019s violence. In the north of the city, protesters set fire to barricades on Avinguda Meridiana, one of the main roads leading into the city. Meanwhile, in Madrid, police baton-charged groups of demonstrators in the city centre who were protesting against the sentences handed out to the Catalan leaders. In other developments Ada Colau, the mayor of Barcelona, and Roger Torrent, the president of the Catalan parliament, on Saturday formed an alliance with trade union and other groups to create a \u201cworkspace\u201d against violence and the Spanish government\u2019s insistence on using legal measures to deal with the Catalan issue. No one from the Catalan government took part in the group\u2019s first meeting. Friday\u2019s violence in Barcelona was centred on the headquarters of the national police force on Via Laietana. Black smoke rose above the city as protesters set fire to rubbish bins and a newspaper kiosk. Thousands gathered in the surrounding streets chanting: \u201cThe streets will always be ours!\u201d Police struggled to control the situation, firing rubber bullets, teargas and, later in the night, a water cannon was deployed against demonstrators for the first time since it was bought from Israel in 1994. Officers from both national and regional forces have been criticised for their heavy-handed actions and a journalist from El Pa\u00eds was arrested while covering Friday\u2019s skirmishes. Other members of the Spanish media have been intimidated and targeted by some independence supporters. The city council says the violence this week has cost the city more than \u20ac2m (\u00a31.7m) \u2013 much of it lost by the burning of more than 1,000 rubbish bins. Many Barcelona residents woke up on Saturday to find there was no where to put their garbage. Hundreds of council workers were on the streets on Saturday trying to clean up from the previous night. Spain\u2019s interior minister, Fernando Grande-Marlaska, travelled to Barcelona on Saturday to meet his Catalan counterpart and to visit national police officers injured in Friday\u2019s violence. The march that had preceded the unrest had been overwhelmingly peaceful. According to Barcelona police, about 525,000 people congregated in the city, many of them having marched there from around Catalonia. A radical movement of young Catalan separatists, Arran, has called for a new demonstration \u201cagainst repression\u201d in central Barcelona on Saturday afternoon. Spain\u2019s government has promised a firm, united and proportionate response to the violence but has said it will not fall into the trap of further inflaming tensions. \u201cThe only hope of those violent groups is that we\u2019ll make mistakes and become overexcited and divided,\u201d the acting prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, said on Wednesday. S\u00e1nchez\u2019s caretaker government has already said it could activate article 155 of the constitution, which would allow it to suspend the regional government and assume direct rule of the region. The socialist prime minister\u2019s rightwing opponents are calling for the government to take a hard line on the latest eruption of the regional independence crisis. Spain is due to hold its fourth general election in as many years on 10 November. Although S\u00e1nchez has taken a more conciliatory approach to the Catalan question than his predecessor, he has ruled out any referendum on Catalan independence and insisted any negotiations will have to respect the Spanish constitution, which stresses the \u201cindissoluble unity\u201d of the country.",

Do not read on unless you have watched season seven, episodes three and four.</em></p> <h2><strong>Money talks</strong></h2> <p>If you\u2019re counting, \u20ac329,510 fell out of that loft last week, which is a decent haul for some dopey kids putting in a few minutes\u2019 work. The current understanding is that Herville\u2019s informant Wang was holding drugs and money for the Curial estate gangsters, headed by Nassir Benslimane. In the garment district, we\u2019ve got pillar of the Wen community Mr Chen running Agathe Passion and Wang\u2019s partner in the Chinese restaurant Wei Xu running Street Fashion. The rag trade washes the dirty money, and so the gears of the black economy keep turning.</p> <p>The vital intel comes from Kader \u2013 but not before he plays Ali like a harpsichord, getting a witness\u2019s name and address from him without lifting a finger. As a result, the witness catches a beatdown and her flat gets trashed. Ali\u2019s misstep is so knuckleheaded it calls to mind prime Gilou. This new kid is fitting in just fine.</p> <p>The squad are nothing if not persistent, though, and they get their first big break when they discover Rayan\u2019s brother Fouad transporting cash for the Chinese. With Rayan now in custody, Fouad\u2019s next visit suddenly becomes a lot more interesting.</p> <h2><strong>Gilou</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f075ac32b90df44636730de2ad1e5ae6405b55ad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f075ac32b90df44636730de2ad1e5ae6405b55ad/0_102_3543_2126/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Big mouth strikes again ...

But the real emotional clout comes with the return of Tintin. The divorce, being shot in the head and leaving the squad have given Fromentin perspective, insight, and the certain knowledge that, in the end, it is not some all-consuming career, but love that counts. \u201cDon\u2019t mess it up,\u201d he says intently to Gilou and Laure, like he\u2019s some fanfic writer who has never met them. No offence, Tintin, but messing it up is kind of their thing.</p> <h2><strong>Laure</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"487353c56459b4b08d544ea12f375fca17b01124\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/487353c56459b4b08d544ea12f375fca17b01124/0_0_2834_1701/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mother knows best? ...

Her tardiness is, however, the only reason she is able to catch up with the fake postman and identify the Chinatown fashion connection, so yay Laure, I guess?</p> <p>Less stellar is her parenting performance, which hits a new low this week as she risks Romy\u2019s life by dodging Nathalie\u2019s calls alerting her to her daughter\u2019s illness. It lands her in family court, with the Br\u00e9monts seeking full parental responsibility for the child. She doesn\u2019t even put up a fight \u2013 knowing as she must by now that Romy is better off without her.</p> <h2><strong>Jos\u00e9phine</strong></h2> <p>Over to Ms Karlsson, who\u2019s been putting in some hours doing pro bono family law for heroin addict inmate M\u00e9lanie (it\u2019s just as well for Romy that Laure didn\u2019t have her in her corner). Spotting a fine legal distinction between kidnapping and parental child abduction that M\u00e9lanie\u2019s lawyer missed, she offers her new client knowledge that will secure her release. All she asks in return is that the dope getting hurled over the wall into the yard now goes to Lola. It\u2019s a fair deal.</p> <p>Later, Jos\u00e9phine and Lola bond through the cell bars of solitary after throwing down with Sabine the crooked guard. I\u2019d like to say friendship or romance is on the cards, but the smart money is on an apocalyptic crimewave.</p> <p>Meanwhile, on Jos\u00e9phine\u2019s attempted murder rap, Edelman pulls out all the stops in a crime scene reconstruction that seems to show that Vern could not possibly have identified Jos\u00e9phine on the night in question. That\u2019s just the tonic a girl needs \u2013 but when her old nemesis Judge Wagner insists on a reconstruction of his own, you can hear the facepalm from the moon.</p> <h2><strong>Roban</strong></h2> <p>Fran\u00e7ois and Catherine Micallef continue to use M Vouters\u2019 fatal haemorrhage as a springboard for their outrageous flirting. It\u2019s a tale as old as time \u2013 a principled overworked doc \u2013 struggling to hit hospital targets \u2013 warns the suits about chronic understaffing, is roundly ignored and then forced to carry the can when the inevitable avoidable death occurs. If anyone knows about fighting the system, it\u2019s Roban, and it\u2019s safe to say he\u2019s finding the case for the defence very persuasive right now. Someone get a round of Calvados in.</p> <h2><strong>Notes and observations</strong></h2> <p>\u2022 Below-the-line Flic of the Week goes to MatthewCobb, who could see that Fouad was a wrong \u2019un from the jump. Trust no one on this show.</p> <p>\u2022 Nathalie Br\u00e9mont continues to be the most understanding wife in history, raising her husband\u2019s love child without complaint, phoning Laure around the clock to arrange children\u2019s parties or save her daughter\u2019s life.</p> <p>\u2022 Edelman remains the sleazy lawyer we all love to hate, but as he calls in a favour from his Bar Association president friend for Jos\u00e9phine, we get the strong impression it\u2019s for love. As touching as that is, I don\u2019t see it ending well.</p> <p>\u2022 The prefect (a senior civil servant) lets Beckriche know that any operations in the garment district will need Lenoir\u2019s personal approval. Political expedience trumps law enforcement once again. Procureur Machard would be proud.</p> <p><em>Just how deep is Fouad in the money-laundering racket? Will Jos\u00e9phine beat the rap? How long before Roban and Dr Micallef are an item? </em><em>Over to you \u2026</em></p>",

All she asks in return is that the dope getting hurled over the wall into the yard now goes to Lola. It\u2019s a fair deal. Later, Jos\u00e9phine and Lola bond through the cell bars of solitary after throwing down with Sabine the crooked guard. I\u2019d like to say friendship or romance is on the cards, but the smart money is on an apocalyptic crimewave. Meanwhile, on Jos\u00e9phine\u2019s attempted murder rap, Edelman pulls out all the stops in a crime scene reconstruction that seems to show that Vern could not possibly have identified Jos\u00e9phine on the night in question. That\u2019s just the tonic a girl needs \u2013 but when her old nemesis Judge Wagner insists on a reconstruction of his own, you can hear the facepalm from the moon. Roban Fran\u00e7ois and Catherine Micallef continue to use M Vouters\u2019 fatal haemorrhage as a springboard for their outrageous flirting. It\u2019s a tale as old as time \u2013 a principled overworked doc \u2013 struggling to hit hospital targets \u2013 warns the suits about chronic understaffing, is roundly ignored and then forced to carry the can when the inevitable avoidable death occurs. If anyone knows about fighting the system, it\u2019s Roban, and it\u2019s safe to say he\u2019s finding the case for the defence very persuasive right now. Someone get a round of Calvados in. Notes and observations \u2022 Below-the-line Flic of the Week goes to MatthewCobb, who could see that Fouad was a wrong \u2019un from the jump. Trust no one on this show. \u2022 Nathalie Br\u00e9mont continues to be the most understanding wife in history, raising her husband\u2019s love child without complaint, phoning Laure around the clock to arrange children\u2019s parties or save her daughter\u2019s life. \u2022 Edelman remains the sleazy lawyer we all love to hate, but as he calls in a favour from his Bar Association president friend for Jos\u00e9phine, we get the strong impression it\u2019s for love. As touching as that is, I don\u2019t see it ending well. \u2022 The prefect (a senior civil servant) lets Beckriche know that any operations in the garment district will need Lenoir\u2019s personal approval. Political expedience trumps law enforcement once again. Procureur Machard would be proud. Just how deep is Fouad in the money-laundering racket? Will Jos\u00e9phine beat the rap? How long before Roban and Dr Micallef are an item? Over to you \u2026",

      "bodyText": "A day after telling reporters he would consider voting to impeach Donald Trump, the Florida Republican Francis Rooney told Fox News he had decided to retire from Congress. On Friday, Rooney was asked about the political consequences of impeachment, a process the House will probably vote to advance after an inquiry steered by Democratic-controlled committees. He said he wanted \u201cto get the facts and do the right thing because I\u2019ll be looking at my children a lot longer than I\u2019m looking to anybody in this building\u201d. No House Republicans have yet said they will vote to impeach the president and send the matter to the Senate for trial. Senate Republicans are not expected to defect in numbers great enough to convict Trump and ensure his removal. But it has been reported that majority leader Mitch McConnell is preparing his caucus. In the same Friday conversation, Rooney said: \u201cWhether I run again is a totally different can of worms, OK?\u201d On Saturday he confirmed to Fox News that he would not. Asked if other Republicans felt as he did about impeachment, he said \u201cthere are people that talk, that have concerns about a lot of things that have happened \u2013 Syria and Mulvaney\u2019s comments just the other day are probably going to drive some people to rethink this a little more. I have, I was shocked at those.\u201d The president\u2019s abrupt decision to withdraw US troops from Syria remains hugely controversial. The acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, suggested to reporters on Thursday that there had been a quid pro quo in Trump\u2019s treatment of Ukraine, from which he sought political gain, and that the media should \u201cget over it\u201d. He later tried to walk the comments back. Rooney told Fox News he \u201choped\u201d other Republicans were becoming more likely to think as he did on impeachment. Announcing his retirement, he said: \u201cI\u2019ve done what I came to do. I want to be the model for term limits.\u201d He added: \u201cI thought the idea was you came and did your public service and left, you accomplish what you want to accomplish and you left. And that\u2019s what I want to be an example to do. \u201cAnd I\u2019m also tired of the intense partisanship that stops us from solving the big questions that America needs solved.\u201d An investor, Republican donor and former US ambassador to the Holy See under George W Bush, Rooney was elected to Congress in 2016. Republican retirement announcements have stacked up since the Democrats took the House in the 2018 midterms. Trump\u2019s tempestuous presidency has added to the party\u2019s challenges at the polls. According to ballotpedia.org, 14 Republican representatives have said they will bow out in 2020. Many are from districts where Democrats are expected to challenge. Rooney is not. Asked if Republicans were worried about Florida\u2019s 19th district, in the south-west of the state, the National Republican Congressional Committee spokesman Chris Pack simply told the Washington Post: \u201cR+13.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Australia will push for a million square kilometres of the Antarctic ocean to be protected as a marine sanctuary at an international forum in Hobart this week. Bids to preserve a large area of pristine ocean off east Antarctica have struck opposition in the past, including at last year\u2019s meeting of the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, where China and Russia played a part in blocking the proposal. Australia is co-sponsoring the proposal for an East Antarctic Marine Protected Area, along with the European Union, and will resubmit it at this year\u2019s CCAMLR meeting. The organisation\u2019s membership includes 25 nations and the EU. The plan requires the support of all members for it to proceed. The environment minister, Sussan Ley, said the decision to pursue the sanctuary \u201cunderlines our commitment to protecting the Antarctic and Southern Ocean\u201d. Gillian Slocum, the leader of Australia\u2019s delegation to the CCAMLR, said the proposal would protect reefs and safeguard several marine species. \u201cWhen established, the East Antarctic MPA will protect distinctive deep-water reefs and feeding areas for marine mammals, penguins and other seabirds,\u201d she said. The Australian Antarctic Division said the proposed sanctuary would also provide scientific reference zones to help researchers understand the effects of fishing outside protected areas and the consequences of climate change for Southern Ocean ecosystems. The Australian Antarctic explorer and adventurer Tim Jarvis has called on member countries to support the plan, warning that climate change and the threat of industrial fishing were putting pressure \u201con this incredible place\u201d. \u201cIf you don\u2019t protect those resources, you risk disrupting the whole global food web in the ocean,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to head off climate change but you\u2019re going to make them more resilient to it. \u201cIf it could all be protected, that would be fantastic but if we could get this million square kilometres it would be a huge step in the right direction.\u201d But he added that most of the changes necessary to protect Antarctica and its marine life needed to be through a collective global effort to cut carbon pollution and limit global heating. \u201cYou want to protect Antarctica, we need to change the way we do things back in the rest of the world ... in the cities where 75% of us live, where we consume the energy that contributes to the CO2 emissions,\u201d he said. Australian Associated Press contributed to this report \u2022 This story was amended on 21 October 2019 to remove a reference to Norway opposing the sanctuary. Norway has supported the proposal since 2014.",

In a statement reported by the Cook Islands News, the prime minister\u2019s chief of staff, Ben Ponia, thanked Evans for bringing \u201cpassion, expertise, and energy into this role\u201d. Several sources have told the Guardian that Evans lost her job, which was within the office of the prime minister, because of her support for the moratorium. This has been reported in the Cooks, and has not been denied by the government. The prime minister\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment on Evans\u2019s dismissal. Evans said a moratorium should be acceptable to both supporters and opponents of mining. \u201cAdvocates for manganese nodule mining \u2026 say that the only life at 4.5km to 6km deep, where the manganese nodules lie on the seabed, are small \u2018head lice\u2019,\u201d she said. \u201cWe know so little about the ecosystem at that depth. We need to collect more information before such statements can be made.\u201d The Cook Islands Seabed Minerals Authority said ocean survey work over four decades had identified as much as 12bn square tonnes of mineral-rich manganese nodules spread over the Cook Islands\u2019 continental shelf. \u201cThis seabed mineral resource offers a significant opportunity for the long-term sustainable economic and social development of the Cook Islands,\u201d it said. In a statement last week, the minerals authority said: \u201cDespite calls for a 10-year moratorium on seabed mining in the Pacific to allow time to conduct more environmental research, the Cooks are set to be the frontier of the new gold rush\u201d. Deputy prime minister Mark Brown said seabed mining could prove vital to the country\u2019s financial security and contribute revenue towards climate change resilience. \u201cWe can\u2019t just sit back and expect good things to happen for the country, and I see us as taking the lead,\u201d Brown said. Deep-sea \u2013 or seabed \u2013 mining has proved contentious wherever it has been proposed. Proponents argue it could yield ore far superior to land mining in silver, gold, copper, manganese, cobalt and zinc, with little, if any, waste product. The industry is potentially worth billions of dollars and could assist the transition to a renewable energy economy, supplying raw materials for key technologies such as batteries, computers and phones. Environmental and legal groups have urged extreme caution, arguing there are potentially massive ramifications for the environment and for nearby communities. Scientists argue deep sea biodiversity and ecosystems remain poorly understood, making it impossible to properly assess the potential impacts of mining \u2013 including disturbance of seafloor ecosystems, sediment displacement and noise, vibration and light pollution.",

Our lives would be improved overnight if the political debate in this country could ditch the surplus obsession. The pertinent question at the moment is not whether a budget surplus will be delivered this financial year, but why on earth would you aim to do so? Why do we need a budget surplus? It is not a question that gets asked too much \u2013 certainly not during the election campaign just passed, where both major parties argued over who had the bigger surplus. The typical answer you get given is some vague notion of living within your means, saving for a rainy day, needing to pay down debt. It\u2019s all simplistic babble spoken by politicians with next to no economic logic in order to convince voters that somehow they are good at managing the economy \u2013 and for the most part it is taken as given by journalists. The balance of the budget tells us very little about the management of the economy. Liberal Party MPs would have you believe that the mining boom during the 2000s occurred because of the budget surplus. In reality the stonking amounts of revenue that flowed in to the government\u2019s coffers during that time meant it was almost impossible not to run a surplus. In 2000-01 government revenue reached 26% of GDP \u2013 a level greater than the amount of spending done by the Rudd government in 2009-10 when it embarked on its massive stimulus program to offset the impact of the GFC. If the Rudd government had enjoyed the same level of revenue that the Howard government routinely did, it would have at worst had a deficit of about $3bn \u2013 rather than going into a deficit of 4.2% of GDP, or $54bn. But of course, if it had revenue of that size it would not have needed to create a massive stimulus in order to keep the economy going. When you get down to it, the only outcome that really matters in the economy is household living standards. We want low unemployment, high productivity growth and all other things because we want it to lead to better living standards. During the mining boom, you could be forgiven for thinking that a surplus was a sign that the economy was being well managed \u2013 household disposable income was growing at around 4% a year in real terms Now, government revenue is growing off the back of high commodity prices, but our economy is struggling and household living standards are falling. Over the past three years household living standards have fallen by levels more akin to a deep recession than a period where a government should be seeking to take the heat out of the economy with a budget surplus. Because everyone should tattoo this to their eyeballs: the only reason for a budget surplus is to slow the economy in order to control inflation. This happened during the mining boom \u2013 but so addicted was Howard to cutting taxes and providing tax concessions that the budget surpluses were actually too small to stop inflation growth from rising. And thus the Reserve Bank raised interest rates 12 times in six years in order to slow things down. Back then the Howard government was content for this to happen because they believed they would always be able to sell the line that interest rates would always be lower under a Liberal government. Now we are in the opposite situation. Inflation barely has a pulse, the overall economy is growing slower than it has since 2001, and the private sector is growing slower than at any time since the 1990s recession. The Morrison government is mostly content to let the RBA keep cutting rates to stimulate the economy because it believes it will be able to sell the line that it is doing a good job because it has delivered a budget surplus. The last time we had a budget surplus was in 2007-08, when the RBA raised the cash rate four times, from 6.25% to 7.25%. So far this financial year the RBA has cut the cash rate three times, from 1.5% to 0.75%. That is not a sign the economy needs slowing. The last time the RBA raised the cash rate was in November 2010 \u2013 a time so long ago Steve Smith had only played in two test matches, Novak Djokovic had won only one grand slam title and Australians had yet to see the new British TV series, Downton Abbey. During that entire time we have been obsessed about trying to get back to a budget surplus and yet also during that time inflation growth has remained weak, and household living standards have stagnated. But such has been the potency of the surplus con job that should the government actually face reason and dare to utter the words \u201cstimulus,\u201d most news outlets would be quickly running with the failure to deliver a surplus, and the ALP as well would quickly get on board attacking the move. And we would continue this awful economic debate where we discuss things through a frame that has been irrelevant for more than a decade now. At some point, someone in the ALP or LNP is going to twig that the economy has changed since the GFC \u2013 what seemed correct then is most definitely not now. It is time to ditch the surplus mania and force our government to stop worrying about some political con-job about economic management and to start facing up to the five years of falling living standards that have occurred under their watch. \u2022 Greg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia",

      "bodyText": "\u201cSome for one purpose and some for another liketh, loveth, getteth, and useth Mappes, Chartes, &amp; Geographicall Globes.\u201d So explained John Dee, the occult philosopher of the Tudor era. The mystical Dr Dee would, perhaps, have understood the passion stirred by Geosciences Australia\u2019s recent decision to stop producing or selling paper versions of its topographic maps in December, citing dwindling demand. In the 21st century, digital files might be more practical, particularly for a cash-strapped federal government agency. But not everyone loveth and getteth their maps for purely practical reasons. Just ask Brendan Whyte. He\u2019s a curator at the National Library of Australia, responsible for acquiring a copy of every map published in Australia, as well as managing a collection of perhaps a million or so charts and about the same number of aerial photographs. A geographer by training, he knows that some people don\u2019t appreciate electronic cartography. \u201cOne of the problems, with the development of GIS [geographic information systems] and everyone making their own maps is that people just dump their data without thinking about the aesthetics or what the map is trying to tell a reader.\u201d A map, he says, needs beauty so that users want to look at it and absorb what it contains. But that\u2019s less about particular platforms, whether digital or otherwise, than the cartographer\u2019s skill. Whyte gives, as an example of what can be done with data, Minard\u2019s famous map of Napoleon\u2019s Russian campaign, on which a band represents both the progress and the extent of the Grande Arm\u00e9e juxtaposed against temperatures in 1812 and 1813, so that the viewer necessarily imagines the privations of a disintegrating army throughout a terrible Russian winter. Whyte also admires the artistry of the Marshall Island stick charts from the NLA\u2019s own collection. It\u2019s believed to be from the early 1970s. \u201cThey\u2019re thin pieces of coconut wood put together in a sort of lattice like a cat\u2019s cradle and wherever there was an atoll they\u2019d lash on [a] little cowrie shell to represent that island. The bits of coconut wood represent the routes, the wave patterns, the winds, the currents. So they\u2019re not a geographical representation like a modern map, but more how a navigator might get from one island to another via the sea route in a canoe with a big sail.\u201d His favourite catalogued item might also be one of the smallest, an atlas from Queen Mary\u2019s dollhouse. \u201cA lot of publishing companies and authors produced real books for her dollhouse. The famous map shop and publishers Stanfords made her the Atlas of the British Empire, reducing it to about two inches high.\u201d At the State Library of Victoria, the librarian Sarah Ryan also nominates an atlas \u2013 albeit a rather bigger one \u2013 as a particularly treasured item. \u201cIt\u2019s known as the first modern day atlas, even though it was produced in 1572: Ortelius\u2019s Mirror of the World. The printing of that volume is beautiful and the maps are very colourful, and you\u2019ve got lots of iconography like sea monsters and ships and compass roses.\u201d She agrees that, while digital maps can be more convenient, a lot of people still prefer paper, particularly for recreational uses. Ultimately, though, it\u2019s relationships that matter. \u201cWhat pulls you to maps,\u201d she says, \u201cis that connection with people and place and culture.\u201d By way of example, she talks of looking at the SLV\u2019s Atlas of Paris from 1739, just after her own first trip to the city. \u201cI\u2019d visited all those places, so that has a strong connection to me.\u201d Maps, of course, also document territorial claims. The catalogue describes the SLV\u2019s rarest map as coming \u201cfrom the survey of Mr Wedge and others\u201d. The attribution sounds innocuous until you identify the surveyor as the John Wedge who accompanied John Batman on his expedition across Bass Strait. The yellowing paper thus signals the plans for a township in Port Phillip \u2013 and the beginning of Indigenous dispossession. Yet, if maps represent power, they can also show change. It\u2019s a point made by Kay Dancey, the CartoGIS Services Manager at the College of Asia and the Pacific at the Australian National University. A cartographer by training, Dancey provides data visualisation for ANU researchers, as well as managing a collection of hardcopy and digital maps. Her holdings feature items dating back to the 17th century, and include 18th-century works by the French hydrographer and philosopher Jacques-Nicolas Bellin. \u201cThe sheer craft of how they produced these maps \u2026 They\u2019re invariably copper engravings, and there\u2019s such skill required in this process.

Each week \u201csingers\u201d dress in jaw-droppingly odd costumes and \u201cperform\u201d mostly off-key karaoke, and a judging panel of \u201cpersonalities\u201d guess who they are based on hints, heights and voices. At the end of each episode someone is unmasked.</p> <p>Host Osher G\u00fcnsberg called it \u201cproudly the most ridiculous show on television\u201d. In a slightly more <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/sep/24/the-masked-singer-what-is-this-thing-and-why-was-it-on-my-tv-last-night\">acidic description</a>, the Guardian\u2019s Steph Harmon called it emblematic of \u201cthe dumpster-fire crapshoot that has become network television in the digital age\u201d.</p> <p>The Masked Singer began life in South Korea and was successfully exported to the US before arriving on Australian screens, in an attempt to save dwindling ratings at Channel 10. So far, the plan is working. <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/culture/tv-and-radio/ridiculous-show-a-ratings-hit-whether-it-lasts-depends-on-who-s-unmasked-20190924-p52ub5.html\">The first episode</a> drew 1.56 million viewers, the network\u2019s biggest audience since the 2015 launch of I\u2019m A Celebrity \u2026 Get Me Out Of Here.</p> <p>Those numbers have <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/culture/tv-and-radio/the-masked-singer-reclaims-lion-s-share-of-ratings-ahead-of-finale-20191015-p530v4.html\">remained steady</a> and are looking promising for Monday\u2019s finale, and the network has announced they\u2019ll be <a href=\"https://www.nowtolove.com.au/reality-tv/the-masked-singer/masked-singer-australia-season-2-59700\">bringing it back next year</a>. But why, exactly, are so many of us watching it?</p> <p>That question stayed with me long after peeled my body off my friend\u2019s living room floor. I\u2019d expected the enthusiasm to drop off. But episode after episode, reveal after reveal, I remained hooked. A few celebrities existed in my cultural blindspots: I was cold over Wendell Sailor (Rhino) and Brett Lee (Parrot), and had never heard of Darren McMullen (Prawn). But when it came to Paulini (Spider), Deni Hines (Unicorn), Nikki Webster (Alien) and Kate Ceberano (Lion), I couldn\u2019t believe how much I cared.</p> <p>Scanning the list of confirmed and rumoured stars (fans are backing Rob \u201cMillsy\u201d Mills for Wolf, Gorgi Coghlan for Monster, and Cody Simpson for Robot), it struck me how many were products of the Australian 2000s media landscape. Perhaps that explains why we\u2019ve embraced it.</p> <p>For anyone not nursed on the Rove Live teat: host Osher and performer Paulini are both from Australian Idol, while Deni is the daughter of Idol judge Marcia. Many of the predictions so far have included other Idol hopefuls, such as Casey Donovan, Lisa Mitchell, Jessica Mauboy and the aforementioned Millsy. The Big Brother family also includes judge Jackie O, who took over from Gretel in 2008. There was early speculation that Wolf was Big Brother/Neighbours heartthrob Blair McDonough.</p> <p>There\u2019s a reason why my generation feels so sentimental about this period. In the early 2000s, it felt like Australian pop culture was coming into its own. Previously, homegrown celebrities felt so much smaller than their US counterparts, and they were too accessible: you\u2019d see someone from Neighbours nursing a hangover at your local coffee shop, you went to school with a Home and Away cast member.</p> <p>But the influx of US and UK reality franchises created a new kind of Australian star that had a bit more sparkle. Local launches of Pop Stars, Idol, Big Brother and Survivor churned Aussies through the same meat-grinder that had produced real celebrities like Kelly Clarkson and Carrie Underwood. They were on TV every single night; they had to be <em>someone</em>.</p> <p>At the same time, we were watching homegrown favourites \u2013 including Russell Crowe, Cate Blanchett, Nicole Kidman, Baz Luhrmann, Naomi Watts and Heath Ledger \u2013 become Oscar darlings in Hollywood. And<strong> </strong>there was a little thing called the Sydney Olympics. (If Webster hadn\u2019t turned up on The Masked Singer, Australia would have rioted.)</p> <p>But the pleasure of The Masked Singer goes even further: much like Lindsay Lohan herself, the show manages to nourish us with both the joy of nostalgia <em>and</em> the joy of a comeback. It feels good to realise you still like that person you used to like is still around, and they might actually be in on the joke.</p> <p>It\u2019s gratifying to look at these Y2K icons and say: \u201cIn Australia, we respect your low-rise jeans, trucker-capped, body-glittered service, and salute you. Now put on this Alien costume and sing.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022 The Masked Singer finale airs on Monday at 7.30pm on Network 10</em></p>",

Each week \u201csingers\u201d dress in jaw-droppingly odd costumes and \u201cperform\u201d mostly off-key karaoke, and a judging panel of \u201cpersonalities\u201d guess who they are based on hints, heights and voices. At the end of each episode someone is unmasked. Host Osher G\u00fcnsberg called it \u201cproudly the most ridiculous show on television\u201d. In a slightly more acidic description, the Guardian\u2019s Steph Harmon called it emblematic of \u201cthe dumpster-fire crapshoot that has become network television in the digital age\u201d. The Masked Singer began life in South Korea and was successfully exported to the US before arriving on Australian screens, in an attempt to save dwindling ratings at Channel 10. So far, the plan is working. The first episode drew 1.56 million viewers, the network\u2019s biggest audience since the 2015 launch of I\u2019m A Celebrity \u2026 Get Me Out Of Here. Those numbers have remained steady and are looking promising for Monday\u2019s finale, and the network has announced they\u2019ll be bringing it back next year. But why, exactly, are so many of us watching it? That question stayed with me long after peeled my body off my friend\u2019s living room floor. I\u2019d expected the enthusiasm to drop off. But episode after episode, reveal after reveal, I remained hooked. A few celebrities existed in my cultural blindspots: I was cold over Wendell Sailor (Rhino) and Brett Lee (Parrot), and had never heard of Darren McMullen (Prawn). But when it came to Paulini (Spider), Deni Hines (Unicorn), Nikki Webster (Alien) and Kate Ceberano (Lion), I couldn\u2019t believe how much I cared. Scanning the list of confirmed and rumoured stars (fans are backing Rob \u201cMillsy\u201d Mills for Wolf, Gorgi Coghlan for Monster, and Cody Simpson for Robot), it struck me how many were products of the Australian 2000s media landscape. Perhaps that explains why we\u2019ve embraced it. For anyone not nursed on the Rove Live teat: host Osher and performer Paulini are both from Australian Idol, while Deni is the daughter of Idol judge Marcia. Many of the predictions so far have included other Idol hopefuls, such as Casey Donovan, Lisa Mitchell, Jessica Mauboy and the aforementioned Millsy. The Big Brother family also includes judge Jackie O, who took over from Gretel in 2008. There was early speculation that Wolf was Big Brother/Neighbours heartthrob Blair McDonough. There\u2019s a reason why my generation feels so sentimental about this period. In the early 2000s, it felt like Australian pop culture was coming into its own. Previously, homegrown celebrities felt so much smaller than their US counterparts, and they were too accessible: you\u2019d see someone from Neighbours nursing a hangover at your local coffee shop, you went to school with a Home and Away cast member. But the influx of US and UK reality franchises created a new kind of Australian star that had a bit more sparkle. Local launches of Pop Stars, Idol, Big Brother and Survivor churned Aussies through the same meat-grinder that had produced real celebrities like Kelly Clarkson and Carrie Underwood. They were on TV every single night; they had to be someone. At the same time, we were watching homegrown favourites \u2013 including Russell Crowe, Cate Blanchett, Nicole Kidman, Baz Luhrmann, Naomi Watts and Heath Ledger \u2013 become Oscar darlings in Hollywood. And there was a little thing called the Sydney Olympics. (If Webster hadn\u2019t turned up on The Masked Singer, Australia would have rioted.) But the pleasure of The Masked Singer goes even further: much like Lindsay Lohan herself, the show manages to nourish us with both the joy of nostalgia and the joy of a comeback. It feels good to realise you still like that person you used to like is still around, and they might actually be in on the joke. It\u2019s gratifying to look at these Y2K icons and say: \u201cIn Australia, we respect your low-rise jeans, trucker-capped, body-glittered service, and salute you. Now put on this Alien costume and sing.\u201d \u2022 The Masked Singer finale airs on Monday at 7.30pm on Network 10",

They were loved and cared for, but Hazelman remembers how tight money was. Her father was a shift worker and her mother stayed home with the children for many years, before working at local supermarkets. There were few holidays and no money for luxuries.</p> <p>Kasey \u201chated exams\u201d and left school before she was 15 to go straight to a full-time job in a caf\u00e9. She says her family circumstances motivated her to make money, to become independent.</p> <p>\u201cI suppose I\u2019ve learned from mum and dad what not to do,\u201d she says with a laugh. \u201cWhen I was younger, it probably limited me a lot \u2026 we never we never had money, but that\u2019s why I always worked. If I wanted a nice skirt, I bought it myself ... Mum always paid for our food of course, but if wanted clothes and things like that, we had to pay for it ourselves or we wouldn\u2019t get it.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier this year, she bought a boutique for $63,000 outright \u2013 she doesn\u2019t like debts \u2013 and she and her husband Nathan, an electrician, have bought a house in Kyabram and are now renovating. She works a second job managing a bar two nights a week and the couple are hoping to have a child next year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8270d628a95e88c888625bc4c2f8ff46889fae4b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8270d628a95e88c888625bc4c2f8ff46889fae4b/0_67_1752_1052/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kasey Hazelman as a young girl\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kasey Hazelman as a young girl</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI think we\u2019re pretty lucky to be in Australia,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople just need to get off their arses I reckon.\u201d</p> <p>The study presents a complex and subtle picture of class in Australia. These children grew up in the 1990s, a time of dramatic economic change that included a recession. In Victoria, the Kennett government oversaw big cuts to government services.</p> <p>The families in the study who were on low incomes were more likely to be led by a single parent \u2013 usually the mother. The parents were more likely to come from a non\u2013English speaking background and have little formal education beyond year 10. By the age of three, children from low-income families were already being excluded from some participation in the wider world, with less use of paid childcare, playgroups and libraries.</p> <p>Access to kindergarten was less likely for children from poorer backgrounds, mainly due to cost, and fathers were less involved with their children\u2019s lives. As school went on, parents on low incomes had a tougher time affording school fees. Some children missed out on school and after-school activities such as sport and music and were less likely to have resources at home, such as computers. The children who did less well academically were more likely to be from low-income families, although it wasn\u2019t uniform.</p> <p>While 98% of students from high-income families completed the VCE (Victoria\u2019s senior school certificate) and 86% in medium-income families, the figure was only 44% for low-income families.</p> <h2>The education equation</h2> <p>Anna Lam grew up in housing commission flats in Richmond with her mother and younger brother, Robert. Her mother, Hui Yi Chen, fled a violent relationship when Anna was about five, and she remembers staying at a women\u2019s refuge for a time. The flats could be \u201cpretty scary\u201d and she recalls a stigma about living in public housing. But because there were so many children and the local primary school was so inclusive and diverse, it wasn\u2019t something that bothered her. It was just her world.</p> <p>Today, at 29, Lam is talking about her early life and influences at a primary school in Melbourne\u2019s north. She\u2019s a teacher of year 1 children, has bought a unit, is engaged to be married and is about to fly off for her first big European holiday.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0312d975dcd5d6137976792cf094d8a4bcd16c84\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0312d975dcd5d6137976792cf094d8a4bcd16c84/673_0_1200_1567/766.jpg\" alt=\"Anna Lam as a girl in Melbourne\" width=\"766\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anna Lam as a girl in Melbourne.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What made a difference to her, she said, was her mother\u2019s insistence that education was the pathway to independence.</p> <p>\u201cSometimes she\u2019d look at the homework and be like \u2018oh that\u2019s not enough, let\u2019s go to the newsagent to buy those exercise books and with all those different worksheets\u2019\u2026. when we had parent teacher interviews, she\u2019d go, \u2018oh, what else could we do?\u2019</p> <p>\u201cShe always said that you need to finish high school and go to uni and get a job because I don\u2019t want you to end up with nothing.\u201d</p> <p>Lam smiles about it now, but she looks back at her mother\u2019s efforts with admiration. She supported her family by working long hours waitressing at restaurants. She insisted that Lam and her brother \u2013 now studying psychology at university \u2013 attend Mandarin school on Sundays. She took them to church \u2013 even though she was not religious \u2013 because it was a way for her children to meet people and learn values.</p> <p>Thinking back, Lam didn\u2019t feel she missed out on much \u2013 a government program helped pay for school excursions, for instance. She remembers a primary school drama and music teacher who took an interest in her, encouraging her to form dance groups and perform publicly.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s definitely harder if you\u2019re working class \u2026 when your friends have gadgets and you don\u2019t, you kind of go, \u2018Oh, I wish I had that\u2019, but I guess I was a sensible child. OK, we can\u2019t afford it, it is what it is.\u201d</p> <p>Bowman says the belief in education as transformative is powerful in Australia, but it\u2019s complicated. The latest study identifies \u201csmooth\u201d and \u201crocky\u201d pathways into work, and those pathways are linked to disadvantage.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t just the economic privileges that helped those from high-income families, but the social and cultural capital \u2013 the assumptions that higher education was within reach and the connections that could help. Some young adults had experienced challenges \u2013 such as divorce or illness \u2013 but they had resources to cushion the impact.</p> <p>Those who had a rocky pathway were more likely to have come from low-income families, possibly with unemployed parents, and to have missed out on extracurricular activities. They were also more likely to be men, with an equal distribution between Australian-born and non-English speaking parents.</p> <p>Hard work matters, but there are those in the study who are smart and had family support but have been knocked around by circumstances. Bowman mentions one young man who had to contribute money to his family and so had to stop studying. Others have had housing problems and family breakdowns.</p> <p>\u201cEducation is really important, it can be transformational, but the point is, it\u2019s not transactional,\u201d Bowman said. \u201cIt\u2019s not OK to think, \u2018I\u2019ll go to uni and get a good job\u2019.</p> <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t work like that. It\u2019s all those other forms of knowledge, resources and networks that you need as well.\u201d</p> <p>Attitudes towards education varied, too. For poorer students, the study identified that higher education was a means to get a job, a pathway to economic security. For those from better-off families, university was part of a long-term strategy, to network, to understand the \u201crules of the game\u201d towards a career. They were more likely to take time off to travel and study abroad.</p> <h2>\u2018I feel very lucky\u2019</h2> <p>Nick Manzoni is on the phone from China where he is on a scholarship, studying a master of laws with contemporary Chinese studies. He\u2019s here for a purpose. He and a friend, Eric Huang, run an online travel management company and they have ambitions to appeal to more mainland Chinese tourists. The course is as much about networking as the subject material.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ca55e6b67c12c043e65e7991bce1daf224de1711\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca55e6b67c12c043e65e7991bce1daf224de1711/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nicholas Manzoni, owner/operator of Emperors Temple\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nicholas Manzoni, owner-operator of Emperors Temple.

His was a home water birth and, while the assumption was that he and his sister would attend university, there was no pressure. The children could be individuals \u2013 he dyed his hair blue until he was a teenager. \u201cThey (my parents) were very open-minded about letting me sort of experience my own mistakes and letting me learn from that.\u201d</p> <p>He began Mandarin lessons before he started school, played tennis and loved martial arts. And his parents could afford to set up a scholarship fund when the children were young, which helped Manzoni travel when he was at university. He attended a government primary school, then Wesley College, a prestigious and progressive independent school. He studied science at the University of Melbourne.</p> <p>Manzoni says he has worked hard and forged his own path, but he acknowledges his parents\u2019 contribution. When he was setting up his business, he lived at home, and last year build a self-contained studio on his parents\u2019 property in North Fitzroy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e11d0799dced10cdf944ea5753131de23305858b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e11d0799dced10cdf944ea5753131de23305858b/0_0_2000_3000/667.jpg\" alt=\"Nicholas Manzoni as a child\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nicholas Manzoni as a child.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI feel very lucky\u201d he says. \u201cI can compare myself and my opportunities and experiences to a lot of other people my age or older than me, and I just see how much easier it is. But how much I\u2019m able to do, I guess, is about is my ability to get things done (and) I think that\u2019s quite high.\u201d</p> <p>Bowman says one of the interesting things about the study is how rarely the young adults consider structural issues when describing their chances in life.</p> <p>\u201cWe think it\u2019s because they\u2019ve grown up in an era where it\u2019s all on the individual \u2013 the shift of risk and responsibility has been onto individuals. Working hard is really important, trying is important, no-one would deny that, but there are many people who work hard, try hard, but still can\u2019t succeed because the odds are stacked against them.\u201d</p> <p>The structural factors include a transformed labor market, where entry level jobs are harder to get, and employers assume applicants will have higher qualifications. Under-employment and insecure jobs are common.</p> <p>Then there are relatively new pressures, such as housing.</p> <p>\u201cThe issue around home ownership, housing affordability, these are things that reinforce inequality because if you\u2019re lucky enough to be able to live with your parents in an inner-city house, that\u2019s quite a different circumstance from your parents renting, or if you haven\u2019t got anything to fall back on.\u201d</p> <p>She also notes that the idea of adulthood has changed. Even in their mid to late 20s, many of the study\u2019s subjects are just beginning their careers, having worked in casual jobs for many years.</p> <p>The study has been able to keep in contact with 135 people in the original group of 167 babies \u2013 a good retention rate \u2013 and will keep going as long as the participants are willing to talk about their lives twice a year and if funding can be secured.</p> <p>There is nothing else like it in Australia, Bowman says. It\u2019s not representative, because it only recruited families from inner-city Melbourne, although many have moved interstate or to the country. But it does give a longitudinal picture of people\u2019s lives, what they started with, and how that influenced their chances.</p> <p>A child with a family that has financial resources has always had a leg up, but Life Chances shows how and why, and what can make a difference for those without those early advantages. It points to which policies can smooth the path \u2013 a good education and health system, quality mentoring and career advice, and housing policies that don\u2019t add stress to people already overcoming hardships.</p> <p>The risks, and the pathways, are there, Bowman says.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s undeniable that investment in people pays off.\u201d</p>",

Life Chances has echoes of the British Seven Up series, which has documented the lives of 14 people every seven years since the early 1960s. The heart of both projects is class. Life Chances began with 167 babies born to wealthy parents, poor parents, middle-class parents, migrant and single parents.

She works a second job managing a bar two nights a week and the couple are hoping to have a child next year. \u201cI think we\u2019re pretty lucky to be in Australia,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople just need to get off their arses I reckon.\u201d The study presents a complex and subtle picture of class in Australia. These children grew up in the 1990s, a time of dramatic economic change that included a recession. In Victoria, the Kennett government oversaw big cuts to government services. The families in the study who were on low incomes were more likely to be led by a single parent \u2013 usually the mother. The parents were more likely to come from a non\u2013English speaking background and have little formal education beyond year 10. By the age of three, children from low-income families were already being excluded from some participation in the wider world, with less use of paid childcare, playgroups and libraries. Access to kindergarten was less likely for children from poorer backgrounds, mainly due to cost, and fathers were less involved with their children\u2019s lives. As school went on, parents on low incomes had a tougher time affording school fees. Some children missed out on school and after-school activities such as sport and music and were less likely to have resources at home, such as computers. The children who did less well academically were more likely to be from low-income families, although it wasn\u2019t uniform. While 98% of students from high-income families completed the VCE (Victoria\u2019s senior school certificate) and 86% in medium-income families, the figure was only 44% for low-income families. The education equation Anna Lam grew up in housing commission flats in Richmond with her mother and younger brother, Robert. Her mother, Hui Yi Chen, fled a violent relationship when Anna was about five, and she remembers staying at a women\u2019s refuge for a time. The flats could be \u201cpretty scary\u201d and she recalls a stigma about living in public housing. But because there were so many children and the local primary school was so inclusive and diverse, it wasn\u2019t something that bothered her. It was just her world. Today, at 29, Lam is talking about her early life and influences at a primary school in Melbourne\u2019s north. She\u2019s a teacher of year 1 children, has bought a unit, is engaged to be married and is about to fly off for her first big European holiday. What made a difference to her, she said, was her mother\u2019s insistence that education was the pathway to independence. \u201cSometimes she\u2019d look at the homework and be like \u2018oh that\u2019s not enough, let\u2019s go to the newsagent to buy those exercise books and with all those different worksheets\u2019\u2026. when we had parent teacher interviews, she\u2019d go, \u2018oh, what else could we do?\u2019 \u201cShe always said that you need to finish high school and go to uni and get a job because I don\u2019t want you to end up with nothing.\u201d Lam smiles about it now, but she looks back at her mother\u2019s efforts with admiration. She supported her family by working long hours waitressing at restaurants. She insisted that Lam and her brother \u2013 now studying psychology at university \u2013 attend Mandarin school on Sundays. She took them to church \u2013 even though she was not religious \u2013 because it was a way for her children to meet people and learn values. Thinking back, Lam didn\u2019t feel she missed out on much \u2013 a government program helped pay for school excursions, for instance. She remembers a primary school drama and music teacher who took an interest in her, encouraging her to form dance groups and perform publicly. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely harder if you\u2019re working class \u2026 when your friends have gadgets and you don\u2019t, you kind of go, \u2018Oh, I wish I had that\u2019, but I guess I was a sensible child. OK, we can\u2019t afford it, it is what it is.\u201d Bowman says the belief in education as transformative is powerful in Australia, but it\u2019s complicated. The latest study identifies \u201csmooth\u201d and \u201crocky\u201d pathways into work, and those pathways are linked to disadvantage. It wasn\u2019t just the economic privileges that helped those from high-income families, but the social and cultural capital \u2013 the assumptions that higher education was within reach and the connections that could help. Some young adults had experienced challenges \u2013 such as divorce or illness \u2013 but they had resources to cushion the impact. Those who had a rocky pathway were more likely to have come from low-income families, possibly with unemployed parents, and to have missed out on extracurricular activities. They were also more likely to be men, with an equal distribution between Australian-born and non-English speaking parents. Hard work matters, but there are those in the study who are smart and had family support but have been knocked around by circumstances. Bowman mentions one young man who had to contribute money to his family and so had to stop studying. Others have had housing problems and family breakdowns. \u201cEducation is really important, it can be transformational, but the point is, it\u2019s not transactional,\u201d Bowman said. \u201cIt\u2019s not OK to think, \u2018I\u2019ll go to uni and get a good job\u2019. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t work like that. It\u2019s all those other forms of knowledge, resources and networks that you need as well.\u201d Attitudes towards education varied, too. For poorer students, the study identified that higher education was a means to get a job, a pathway to economic security. For those from better-off families, university was part of a long-term strategy, to network, to understand the \u201crules of the game\u201d towards a career. They were more likely to take time off to travel and study abroad. \u2018I feel very lucky\u2019 Nick Manzoni is on the phone from China where he is on a scholarship, studying a master of laws with contemporary Chinese studies. He\u2019s here for a purpose. He and a friend, Eric Huang, run an online travel management company and they have ambitions to appeal to more mainland Chinese tourists. The course is as much about networking as the subject material. Manzoni knows he has had advantages. \u201cIn Australia, yes, I\u2019m a little bit privileged, but compared to say, coming over here to China and other people from all over the world, very privileged.\u201d He describes his parents, Alex, an academic, and Jenny, an occupational therapist, as hippies from North Fitzroy. His was a home water birth and, while the assumption was that he and his sister would attend university, there was no pressure. The children could be individuals \u2013 he dyed his hair blue until he was a teenager. \u201cThey (my parents) were very open-minded about letting me sort of experience my own mistakes and letting me learn from that.\u201d He began Mandarin lessons before he started school, played tennis and loved martial arts. And his parents could afford to set up a scholarship fund when the children were young, which helped Manzoni travel when he was at university. He attended a government primary school, then Wesley College, a prestigious and progressive independent school. He studied science at the University of Melbourne. Manzoni says he has worked hard and forged his own path, but he acknowledges his parents\u2019 contribution. When he was setting up his business, he lived at home, and last year build a self-contained studio on his parents\u2019 property in North Fitzroy. \u201cI feel very lucky\u201d he says. \u201cI can compare myself and my opportunities and experiences to a lot of other people my age or older than me, and I just see how much easier it is. But how much I\u2019m able to do, I guess, is about is my ability to get things done (and) I think that\u2019s quite high.\u201d Bowman says one of the interesting things about the study is how rarely the young adults consider structural issues when describing their chances in life. \u201cWe think it\u2019s because they\u2019ve grown up in an era where it\u2019s all on the individual \u2013 the shift of risk and responsibility has been onto individuals. Working hard is really important, trying is important, no-one would deny that, but there are many people who work hard, try hard, but still can\u2019t succeed because the odds are stacked against them.\u201d The structural factors include a transformed labor market, where entry level jobs are harder to get, and employers assume applicants will have higher qualifications. Under-employment and insecure jobs are common. Then there are relatively new pressures, such as housing. \u201cThe issue around home ownership, housing affordability, these are things that reinforce inequality because if you\u2019re lucky enough to be able to live with your parents in an inner-city house, that\u2019s quite a different circumstance from your parents renting, or if you haven\u2019t got anything to fall back on.\u201d She also notes that the idea of adulthood has changed. Even in their mid to late 20s, many of the study\u2019s subjects are just beginning their careers, having worked in casual jobs for many years. The study has been able to keep in contact with 135 people in the original group of 167 babies \u2013 a good retention rate \u2013 and will keep going as long as the participants are willing to talk about their lives twice a year and if funding can be secured. There is nothing else like it in Australia, Bowman says. It\u2019s not representative, because it only recruited families from inner-city Melbourne, although many have moved interstate or to the country. But it does give a longitudinal picture of people\u2019s lives, what they started with, and how that influenced their chances. A child with a family that has financial resources has always had a leg up, but Life Chances shows how and why, and what can make a difference for those without those early advantages. It points to which policies can smooth the path \u2013 a good education and health system, quality mentoring and career advice, and housing policies that don\u2019t add stress to people already overcoming hardships. The risks, and the pathways, are there, Bowman says. \u201cIt\u2019s undeniable that investment in people pays off.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "People have started visiting the outback town of Pooncarie just to see a place that\u2019s running dry. Josh Sheard, the publican at the Pooncarie hotel, says the remote town in far south-west New South Wales needs the attention. \u201cThe community are mostly happy to see people, and have a yarn,\u201d Sheard says. \u201cThe town is still here, and we\u2019re not going anywhere. There\u2019s businesses that rely on passing trade.\u201d It sits on the dwindling lower Darling River, about 100 kilometres south of Menindee. Menindee has become a symbol of the dire state of the river system, after millions of dead fish washed up over summer. Pooncarie\u2019s drinking water comes from a bore, but raw water for toilets and outdoor use has been trucked in by the Wentworth Shire council since September. The council says that with little to no rainfall over winter, the \u201czero flow\u201d river conditions will linger. Visitors are curious to see a drying river first hand. \u201cUntil you see it yourself, you wouldn\u2019t believe what it looks like. It\u2019s generally a pretty little town, but everything is dying off,\u201d Sheard says. With 97.2% of NSW in drought, concerns about water supplies are not confined to the outback. There are 40 water storages across the state with less than six months\u2019 supply in a \u201cworst case scenario\u201d, according to figures from the Department of Planning, Industry and Environment. Water supplies in large regional centres such as Tamworth, Orange and Dubbo \u2013 which have a combined population of roughly 140,000 \u2013 are among those identified as being \u201chigh risk\u201d. Warragamba Dam, which supplies water to millions of people in Sydney, is sitting below 50%, while a desalination plant works to top up the supply. In regional areas, councils stress that predictions of an imminent water disaster do not take back-up systems into account. A complicated and so far incomplete network of bores, water diversions, pipelines, and emergency infrastructure such as pumps and weirs are designed to stave off a so-called \u201cday zero\u201d. Most rural communities also have water restrictions, and it is typical for people to shower with buckets at their feet to capture water, reuse baths on gardens, and drive dust-coated cars. Nyngan, a town of about 2,000 in the centre of NSW, is one of the communities listed as having less than six months\u2019 supply. Behind the bright blue and yellow gates of the local pool, hundreds of children spent the school holidays splashing around in water set aside under a special allocation. The sparkling aquamarine water couldn\u2019t be more different from the Bogan River, about one kilometre down the road. \u201cIt\u2019s low and awful, and a bit green,\u201d says Scott Bartley, the pool manager and lifelong Nyngan resident. \u201cIt\u2019s the worst I\u2019ve ever seen it. Kids [usually] use the river in summer, but you can\u2019t swim there now.\u201d Nyngan is one of many towns serviced by Burrendong dam, which is on the Macquarie River and is sitting at below 5%. The Bogan shire mayor, Ray Donald, says Nyngan and surrounding villages have been assured of water supplies from the river until at least the middle of 2020. Water authorities are raising the Warren weir to divert flows, and the town will have access to deep water storage pumped from the dam. The council is also exploring potential bore sites for underground water. The shire is on level 3 water restrictions, which mean residents can only use water outdoors during certain hours. \u201cIt\u2019s a situation that hasn\u2019t occurred before, so we\u2019re going into uncharted territory and it\u2019s very stressful,\u201d Donald said. \u201cBut if [the worst case scenario] does happen, it\u2019s not going to happen next week.\u201d Five hours east of Nyngan sits Tamworth, a regional city home to more than 60,000 people. Tamworth\u2019s Chaffey dam is below 20% and residents are urged to use no more than 150 litres of water per person per day. Level five water restrictions ban lawn and garden watering, and the council suggests residents take short showers, and use washing machines for full loads only. Elva Shumack, from the Country Women\u2019s Association, says only one previous drought rivals this one. The 80-year-old can still picture the Macdonald River running dry on her family farm near Tamworth in the 1940s. Today, she says the view from her window in town is depressing. \u201cTrees in the streets are starting to die. If you look up on the skyline, you can see through trees that you could never see through before.\u201d Shumack says neighbours are having to let go of their gardens, an important part of country living. \u201cI find they\u2019re a bit of joy in your life. It\u2019s civilised living if you\u2019ve got a bit of a garden.\u201d But, she says brightly, her lavender is surviving surprisingly well on reused washing water. Tamworth regional council has assured residents the city \u201cwill not have a day zero\u201d. It points to temporary weirs being built on the Peel River and the construction of a pipeline linking Chaffey dam to the smaller Dungowan dam. Tamworth\u2019s famed country music festival will go ahead in January. Council data shows there is not a significant impact on water consumption during the 10-day event, as some locals leave to rent out their houses to visitors. The city hopes the usual crowd of 50,000 people per day will flock in and add $50 million to the economy. Locals say that support is needed more than ever. \u201cAbsolutely, we\u2019re telling people \u2018please come\u2019,\u201d a council spokeswoman says. In other large regional centres identified as \u201chigh risk\u201d, local governments are trying to calm fears about water. Orange, in the central west, relies on a number of dams, creeks, and a pipeline to the Macquarie River. The city\u2019s total storage has fallen to 30%. Level five water restrictions ban most outdoor water use, and authorities implore people to take three minute showers, and one shallow bath per household per day. A stormwater harvesting system, which collects rain from roads, car parks and roofs, adds water to the supply when potential run-off is lost to parched paddocks. Dubbo, west of Orange, gets water from the drying Burrendong dam, like Nyngan. Dubbo will tap into bore water if the Macquarie River stops flowing next year. It is looking into stormwater harvesting, and recycled water. Residents will move onto tough level four restrictions in November for the first time in the city\u2019s history, but they\u2019ve been warned households are still using too much water. \u201cDubbo regional council would like to think this is the beginning of a behavioural change period for our community that will serve us well into the future,\u201d the council says. After eight decades of rural living, Shumack sees the persistent drought as one of many challenges for people in regional areas. \u201cIf it\u2019s not drought, it\u2019s probably floods, or fires, or a price slump in the livestock market, or there\u2019s health issues if you can\u2019t get to a good hospital. \u201cAll these things need steadfast perseverance and resilience.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>For a man renowned for his civility, the language was blunt. During his annual speech to the Anglican Church\u2019s Sydney synod, Archbishop Glenn Davies told supporters of same-sex marriage to \u201cplease leave us\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cMy own view is that if people wish to change the doctrine of our church, they should start a new church or join a church more aligned to their views,\u201d he said. \u201cBut do not ruin the Anglican Church by abandoning the plain teaching of scripture.\u201d</p> <p>In a report published on the Sydney Anglicans website, Davies\u2019s media manager, Russell Powell, said the archbishop had received a standing ovation at the end of his address \u2013 as indeed he had.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/17/anglican-churches-reject-sydney-archbishops-stance-on-same-sex-marriage\">Anglican churches reject Sydney archbishop\u2019s stance on same-sex marriage</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But in pockets of the hall, there was also discomfort, if not with the core sentiment then with the tone. Davies has long been frustrated by what he believes is the excessive liberalism or tolerance of other Australian bishops towards same-sex relationships, particularly among clergy.</p> <p>Now he watches as two relatively small parts of the church \u2013 the dioceses of Wangaratta in Victoria and Newcastle in New South Wales \u2013 are moving to bless same-sex marriages.</p> <p>Pro-gay marriage Anglicans are walking a fine line in the Australian church. Some want a full marriage rite, such as the one that exists in the Episcopal Church of the US. Others, such as the members of the Wangaratta synod, have voted to bless same-sex marriages conducted under civil law. To Sydney\u2019s \u201cguardians\u201d (their word) of orthodoxy, it is a distinction without difference.</p> <p>One leading Sydney Anglican \u2013 supportive of but frustrated with Davies \u2013 could not work out if the archbishop\u2019s call to \u201cplease leave\u201d was a statement about \u201cdiscipline within the church as opposed to grace outside it\u201d. Was he simply insisting that bishops and priests stop agitating for the church to accommodate same-sex marriage? Or was the leader of Australia\u2019s most powerful Anglican diocese, in an unusually intemperate spray, shunning gay Christians at the door of the church?</p> <p>It took Davies <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/my-words-were-for-the-bishops-and-i-stand-by-them-20191018-p5323u.html\">four days to clarify</a> that his imprecise comments were directed at the bishops, not the parishioners, but the hurt has been profound, especially for those working in Anglican education and social services.</p> <p>This is a critical moment for Australia\u2019s churches. They are attempting to persuade the federal government to accommodate their demands for greater religious freedom, including the right to hire staff whose lives accord to strict biblical views of sex and sexuality. At the same time, they insist they welcome LGBT students into their schools and gay Australians to use their welfare services.</p> <p>The archbishops of the important Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth dioceses rushed to say that no Christian or searcher, regardless of sexuality, would be turned away from church. Perth\u2019s Kay Goldsworthy, often mentioned as a future primate of the Australian church, lamented that \u201cit is troubling that the welcome is not universal\u201d.</p> <p>The irony in all of this controversy is that Sydney\u2019s position \u2013 stripped of its incendiary and exclusionary language \u2013 is broadly the position of the Anglican Church of Australia. On Saturday Melbourne\u2019s Anglican synod expressed \u201cregret\u201d at Wangaratta\u2019s decision and referred the issue to a church tribunal.</p> <p>The church consensus on the issue is best personified by Goldsworthy and her Melbourne counterpart, Philip Freier. Goldsworthy voted yes in the 2017 marriage plebiscite, Freier no. But outside Sydney \u2013 where the diocese pumped $1m into the no campaign \u2013 the church adopted a neutral position.</p> <p>The church accepted the 62% vote in favour of same-sex marriage but, in the perennial Anglican way, set up a committee to study the way it would handle the issue, before a special national meeting next year. Not even Goldsworthy said she would challenge the church\u2019s official marriage doctrine.</p> <p>On issues of sexuality and women\u2019s ministry, the Sydney diocese is increasingly out of step with the church in the rest of Australia and certainly in the US, Canada, New Zealand and much of the UK. But it has reached into the church\u2019s growth areas \u2013 Africa, Asia and Latin America, known as the \u201cglobal south\u201d.</p> <p>Sydney was the progenitor of an organisation called the Global Anglican Future Conference, or Gafcon, which enforces a strict reading of scripture. Most of Gafcon\u2019s member churches remain within the official Anglican communion, recognised by the Archbishop of Canterbury.</p> <p>But more ominously for the worldwide Anglican family, the Sydney diocese has a history of supporting schismatic churches, not endorsed by Canterbury. At the weekend, several Sydney bishops flew to New Zealand to consecrate a bishop not recognised by the official NZ church. They have done the same with the breakaway Anglican Church of North America.</p> <p>Most notoriously \u2013 decades before the controversies over sex, sexuality and even feminism \u2013 Sydney supported the Church of England in South Africa. It was a largely, if not officially, white breakaway movement from the official Anglican Church of Southern Africa. In 1997, CESA\u2019s leader begged forgiveness before South Africa\u2019s Truth and Reconciliation Commission for its inadequate response to the apartheid regime.</p> <p>The Sydney diocese is also on the cusp of dominating the Australian church. Its evangelical theological college, Moore, is a powerhouse, churning out a couple of hundred graduates every year.

      "bodyText": "For a man renowned for his civility, the language was blunt. During his annual speech to the Anglican Church\u2019s Sydney synod, Archbishop Glenn Davies told supporters of same-sex marriage to \u201cplease leave us\u201d. \u201cMy own view is that if people wish to change the doctrine of our church, they should start a new church or join a church more aligned to their views,\u201d he said. \u201cBut do not ruin the Anglican Church by abandoning the plain teaching of scripture.\u201d In a report published on the Sydney Anglicans website, Davies\u2019s media manager, Russell Powell, said the archbishop had received a standing ovation at the end of his address \u2013 as indeed he had. But in pockets of the hall, there was also discomfort, if not with the core sentiment then with the tone. Davies has long been frustrated by what he believes is the excessive liberalism or tolerance of other Australian bishops towards same-sex relationships, particularly among clergy. Now he watches as two relatively small parts of the church \u2013 the dioceses of Wangaratta in Victoria and Newcastle in New South Wales \u2013 are moving to bless same-sex marriages. Pro-gay marriage Anglicans are walking a fine line in the Australian church. Some want a full marriage rite, such as the one that exists in the Episcopal Church of the US. Others, such as the members of the Wangaratta synod, have voted to bless same-sex marriages conducted under civil law. To Sydney\u2019s \u201cguardians\u201d (their word) of orthodoxy, it is a distinction without difference. One leading Sydney Anglican \u2013 supportive of but frustrated with Davies \u2013 could not work out if the archbishop\u2019s call to \u201cplease leave\u201d was a statement about \u201cdiscipline within the church as opposed to grace outside it\u201d. Was he simply insisting that bishops and priests stop agitating for the church to accommodate same-sex marriage? Or was the leader of Australia\u2019s most powerful Anglican diocese, in an unusually intemperate spray, shunning gay Christians at the door of the church? It took Davies four days to clarify that his imprecise comments were directed at the bishops, not the parishioners, but the hurt has been profound, especially for those working in Anglican education and social services. This is a critical moment for Australia\u2019s churches. They are attempting to persuade the federal government to accommodate their demands for greater religious freedom, including the right to hire staff whose lives accord to strict biblical views of sex and sexuality. At the same time, they insist they welcome LGBT students into their schools and gay Australians to use their welfare services. The archbishops of the important Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth dioceses rushed to say that no Christian or searcher, regardless of sexuality, would be turned away from church. Perth\u2019s Kay Goldsworthy, often mentioned as a future primate of the Australian church, lamented that \u201cit is troubling that the welcome is not universal\u201d. The irony in all of this controversy is that Sydney\u2019s position \u2013 stripped of its incendiary and exclusionary language \u2013 is broadly the position of the Anglican Church of Australia. On Saturday Melbourne\u2019s Anglican synod expressed \u201cregret\u201d at Wangaratta\u2019s decision and referred the issue to a church tribunal. The church consensus on the issue is best personified by Goldsworthy and her Melbourne counterpart, Philip Freier. Goldsworthy voted yes in the 2017 marriage plebiscite, Freier no. But outside Sydney \u2013 where the diocese pumped $1m into the no campaign \u2013 the church adopted a neutral position. The church accepted the 62% vote in favour of same-sex marriage but, in the perennial Anglican way, set up a committee to study the way it would handle the issue, before a special national meeting next year. Not even Goldsworthy said she would challenge the church\u2019s official marriage doctrine. On issues of sexuality and women\u2019s ministry, the Sydney diocese is increasingly out of step with the church in the rest of Australia and certainly in the US, Canada, New Zealand and much of the UK. But it has reached into the church\u2019s growth areas \u2013 Africa, Asia and Latin America, known as the \u201cglobal south\u201d. Sydney was the progenitor of an organisation called the Global Anglican Future Conference, or Gafcon, which enforces a strict reading of scripture. Most of Gafcon\u2019s member churches remain within the official Anglican communion, recognised by the Archbishop of Canterbury. But more ominously for the worldwide Anglican family, the Sydney diocese has a history of supporting schismatic churches, not endorsed by Canterbury. At the weekend, several Sydney bishops flew to New Zealand to consecrate a bishop not recognised by the official NZ church. They have done the same with the breakaway Anglican Church of North America. Most notoriously \u2013 decades before the controversies over sex, sexuality and even feminism \u2013 Sydney supported the Church of England in South Africa. It was a largely, if not officially, white breakaway movement from the official Anglican Church of Southern Africa. In 1997, CESA\u2019s leader begged forgiveness before South Africa\u2019s Truth and Reconciliation Commission for its inadequate response to the apartheid regime. The Sydney diocese is also on the cusp of dominating the Australian church. Its evangelical theological college, Moore, is a powerhouse, churning out a couple of hundred graduates every year. These are the men \u2013 and increasingly women \u2013 who are ordained as priests and deacons, not just within the diocese but around the country. Other colleges with more liberal or pluralist views of scripture, such as Ridley and Trinity in Melbourne, simply cannot match the numbers. And with numbers comes power. At the 2017 national synod, Sydney and its allies in the dioceses of Tasmania, Armidale, North West Australia and segments of Melbourne and Adelaide, secured a narrow majority on the powerful standing committee. Pessimistic liberals believe Glenn Davies\u2019s harsh words \u2013 \u201cplease leave\u201d \u2013 betray a deeper motive \u2013 to claim the name \u201cthe Anglican Church of Australia\u201d and as much property as possible, push out all liberals and even moderates and then split more formally from the worldwide communion under the Archbishop of Canterbury. Writing in the June edition of the diocesan newspaper Southern Cross, Davies emphasised that the constitution of the church \u201cdoes not tie us to Canterbury\u201d but only to those churches with doctrine that is consistent with the so-called \u201cFundamental Declarations\u201d \u2013 the Bible, the 1662 Book of Common Prayer and the Thirty-Nine Articles. Sydney has also boycotted the Lambeth Conference, called every 10 years by the Archbishop of Canterbury and considered a critical symbol of Anglican unity. Moderate evangelicals doubt Sydney wants to formally split from Canterbury, pointing out it might not then be able to call itself \u201cAnglican\u201d and hold on to all its property without a fight in the civil courts. In largely secular Australia in 2019, that\u2019s the last place any church would want to be. \u2022 Andrew West is the presenter of The Religion &amp; Ethics Report on ABC Radio National",

I was a little bit lucky! I have to improve that part of my game, but what a cross from Bernardo Silva.

The last time Manchester City had a blip, they won 18 of the next 19 league games to pip Liverpool to the title. They will need produce the same murderous form over an even longer stretch if they are to reel Liverpool in this year. City have dropped eight points in eight games, which equals their worst start to a league season since the Abu Dhabi United Group takeover in 2008. Last season they dropped 16 points in 38 matches. </p> <p>All they can do is start winning again, then keep winning, and hope Liverpool get an almighty case of finishinglineitis. But it\u2019s not beyond the realms that the title race could be over by the time City leave Anfield on 10 November. </p> <p>Today\u2019s match certainly isn\u2019t a banker for City. Roy Hodgson\u2019s Crystal Palace are one of only two teams, Liverpool being the other, to take points off them in each of the last two seasons. That statistic is a reflection of how dominant City have been in recent times. Indeed, they\u2019ve won 79 of their last 100 Premier League games.</p> <p>I haven\u2019t had time to work out but that must be a seriously high win percentage. If they are to win a third consecutive title, it will probably need to be even higher.</p> <p><strong>Kick off is at 5.30pm.</strong></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-19T15:53:27.927Z\">at 4.53pm BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Sachin Nakrani\u2019s match report has arrived, so I\u2019ll leave you with that. Thanks for your company - goodnight! Gabriel Jesus speaks \u201cIt\u2019s always difficult against Palace. We have to try to win every game, and I think this season is going to be the same as last year [with a relentless title race]. I try to improve my football all the time, because I have Aguero with me \u2013 he\u2019s a legend at City, so I have to work every day to be ready for when I\u2019m on the pitch. \u201cI tried to head it [for the goal], but it hit my shoulder. I was a little bit lucky! I have to improve that part of my game, but what a cross from Bernardo Silva. With Bernardo and especially Kevin [de Bruyne], I know when and where the cross is coming and I make my runs based on that. I focus on the goal all the time. I think that\u2019s why I score a lot!\u201d Peep peep! City move to within five points of Liverpool with an easy win at Selhurst Park. Gabriel Jesus and David Silva scored just before half-time, the second a beauty, and Palace rarely looked like getting back into the game. 90+1 min Three minutes of added time. 90 min Pep Guardiola again shows his commitment to youth by bringing on Phil Foden for Kevin De Bruyne. 90 min There\u2019s a break in play after a clash of heads between Hennessey and McArthur. They seem fine. 88 min Ederson makes another excellent save, diving to his right to beat away a vicious shot from Zaha. Ayew, on the stretch, volleys the rebound into orbit. 87 min Joao Cancelo\u2019s low cross is screwed wide by Sterling, who could have had a hat-trick today. If he becomes a really clinical finisher, he\u2019ll score 50 a season in this team. 86 min You\u2019d expect City to win their next two league games, at home to Villa and Southampton. Then it\u2019s the humdinger\u2019s humdinger: Liverpool away on 10 November. 85 min Joao Cancelo moves onto his left foot and whacks a shot that hits the chest of Cahill and flies behind for a corner. This, in truth, has been a 2-0 thrashing. 84 min James Tomkins is replaced by Scott Dann for Palace. 82 min Zaha is complaining to the referee about the lack of yellow cards for City\u2019s tactical fouling. I suspect Anthony Taylor is going to book someone in a minute - Zaha himself, if he doesn\u2019t shut up. I have plenty of sympathy with Zaha, though, because City are extremely good at those play-breaking fouls. 81 min: De Bruyne hits the post! Gundogan wriggled away from a couple of men on the right of the box and clipped a cross to the near post, where De Bruyne arrived late to flick a header across goal and off the inside of the far post. He probably should have scored, but I\u2019ll forgive that man anything while he continues to play at least one orgiastic pass/cross in every match. 80 min David Silva, the Man of the Match for mine, is replaced by John Stones. Rodri moves forward into midfield. 79 min Another chance for City. Sterling, found by a beautiful reverse pass tom the superb David Silva, flicks an abysmal left-footed shot so far across goal that it almost goes out for a throw-in. Just before that, Hennessey made a smart reaction save from an errant header by his own player Kouyate. 77 min Gabriel Jesus wastes a great chance to make it 3-0. City broke dangerously again, with Sterling playing Jesus through. He should have squared it to De Bruyne, who had an open goal on the other side of the six-yard box, but instead hit a shot that was beaten behind by Hennessey. I suspect that, in the dressing-room, Pep will ruin him for that little act of selfishness. 76 min Christian Benteke replaces Milivojevic - and hits the bar with his first touch! He met van Aanholt\u2019s deep, outswinging corner with a thumping header back across goal, and Ederson dived a long way to his right to fingertip it onto the bar. That was a quite brilliant save, especially as he\u2019s had the square root of bugger all to do all night. He is a sensational keeper. 75 min \u201cAm I the only one,\u201d says Michael Ireton, \u201cwho is craving a Tequila Sunrise after watching Man City for an hour?\u201d 74 min Good play from Palace. Zaha plays a one-two with McArthur and hits a deep cross that is volleyed towards goal by van Aanholt on the edge of the area. It\u2019s well struck but a City defender on the six-yard line hoofs it away. 73 min Hennessey makes another good save, this time leaping to push Bernardo Silva\u2019s shot over the bar. It wasn\u2019t as good as the save from Jesus BUT THEY ALL BLOODY WELL COUNT IN FANTASY FOOTBALL, SO BE AWAY WITH YOU. 69 min \u201cEpnalty?\u201d muses Ben Park. \u201cIs that a new penalty which has to be scored on Fifa 20? Wouldn\u2019t put it past Fifa as a marketing strategy.\u201d For the Game. For the World. 68 min Hennessey makes a superb one-handed save, diving to his right, from Gabriel Jesus\u2019s fierce left-footed shot. 66 min I wonder if the City players ever get bored with this type of match. It has been so easy for them. No penalty. Well done everyone. VAR check! They are still looking at it. It could easily have been given on the field, but it\u2019s not a clear and obvious error. 62 min De Bruyne goes down in the area after a clumsy challenge from Zaha. No epnalty is given, and VAR is unlikely to overturn it. It was a risky tackle though. 61 min City are cruising to victory. The second half has been painfully one-sided. 58 min This victory will move City back up to second, five points behind Liverpool. Palace will stay sixth. 55 min Crystal Palace make the obvious substition, with Andros Townsend - who scored that awesome volley at the Etihad last December - replacing Jeff Schlupp. 55 min Sterling misses a decent chance, slicing wide with his left foot from 17 yards. 54 min \u201cI understand that there are a huge range of opinions (some of which are actually valid...) over VAR, but I think we can all agree that the biggest problem so far has been the lack of the constant, nonsense penalties that we were threatened with,\u201d says Matt Dony. \u201cI selected Zaha for my fantasy team purely because he gets kicked so much. This far into the season, it has not paid off.\u201d On the plus si- no. 52 min Sterling whistles a low shot from just inside the area that hits the outside of the post and goes wide. Those last three words, I appreciate, were entirely unnecessary. Sterling is good, really foppin good, but not so good that he can hit a shot off the outside of the post that stays on the pitch. 50 min \u201cI must protest,\u201d says Mary Waltz. \u201cThe City kit resembles what happens if you make a pasta and shrimp dish and leave it in your refrigerator for a year.\u201d 49 min Kouyate takes matters into his own feet, playing a nice one-two with McArthur before slicing a shot well wide from 25 yards. 48 min Palace win a free-kick on the right wing. Milivojevic curls it in, Fernandinho heads clear. City\u2019s midfence has had an easy night so far. 47 min \u201cEvening Rob,\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cI hope you\u2019ve had a good October. The clocks go back next Sunday. I suggest we put them back to 1983?\u201d 14 May 1983 by any chance? 46 min Sterling is booked for a late tackle on Ward, who goes looking for afters without success. 46 min Peep peep! City begin the second half. Peep peep! City are cruising towards an important victory. After a frustrating first 38 minutes, in which they had all the ball without creating many clear chances, Gabriel Jesus and David Silva scored in quick succession to give City a nice cushion. Palace have been unable to get at the unlikely centre-back pairing of Fernandinho and Rodri. 45 min \u201cI think the kits look wonderful - kind of reminiscent of old-fashioned sweeties in jars, or batten burg cakes, or marzipan or something,\u201d says Bill Hargreaves. \u201cA little-known fact: the Manchester City kits are manufactured by the players standing in vats of dye as the colour moves up their torsos, kind of like a secondary school experiment in surface tension.\u201d We all live in a post-fact world. 44 min Kouyate is kicked in the face by De Bruyne, who was going for a high ball. A foul has been given but that\u2019s all. I\u2019m not sure why he wasn\u2019t booked, but at least we can\u2019t say it was a tactical foul. The second goal came 30 seconds after the restart. De Bruyne led a City break with a marauding run past the halfway line. Eventually the ball came to Sterling, just inside the area on the left. He waited for the run of David Silva on his inside and kissed a delicious pass over two defenders into his path. Silva watched the ball onto his left foot and swished a volley through the legs of Hennessey. The pass from Sterling was exquisite, the finish merely excellent. This is a great goal! So much for an organised defence. Bernardo Silva\u2019s inswinging cross from the right found Gabriel Jesus in far too much space eight yards from goal. He mistimed a flicked diving header, but the ball ran off his shoulder and drifted into the net off the far post. One-nil! 38 min City continue to have a barely legal amount of possession without getting behind Palace\u2019s superbly organised defence. Zaha and Ayew have switched positions, with Zaha as the lone striker for the time being. 37 min \u201cMan City are modelling the first ever half and half kit,\u201d sniffs Ian Copestake. If so, they\u2019re playing more like Palermo than Brazil. 36 min \u201cI\u2019m camped out at work, meant to be writing a lecture for Monday,\u201d says Zubin Mistry. \u201cBut keep getting distracted by various surprising things that have been going on today. Like the curious Man City formation in the MBM team news: (0-4-1-2-3). Am I missing a tactics in-joke? Or is this a \u2018clear and obvious error\u2019 that maybe, just maybe, a VAR check might clear up? I need to know or Monday\u2019s lecture just won\u2019t get written.\u201d It was an essentially lame way of saying they have a defence made up of midfield players who will spend most of the game in the middle of the pitch. 33 min No danger here: Milivojevic\u2019s free-kick hits the wall. 32 min After a sloppy pass from Fernandinho, Zaha is fouled by Gundogan 25 yards from goal. Danger here... 30 min \u201cI love the kit!\u201d says Richard Fosbury. \u201cAs it looks like it\u2019s a pack of Refreshers it makes an, erm, refreshing change from the reds, whites and blues!\u201d 29 min David Silva overhits a relatively simple return pass to Sterling. City are starting to get slightly frustrated by Palace\u2019s diligent defending. 27 min It was a clash of heads between Ayew and Fernandinho. He seems okay and is going to continue. 26 min Joao Cancelo\u2019s long-range shot is comfortably saved by Hennessey. Fernandinho is down, holding his head, and John Stones has gone out to warm up. 25 min McArthur plays a ball out towards Zaha on the right, just past the halfway line. Rodri slips, which allows Zaha to hare down the right wing, but Sterling gets back to cover and makes an immaculate tackle just outside the area. 24 min City have had 80 per cent of the possession. Palace can\u2019t sustain this for 90 minutes, surely. They have been surprisingly wishy-washy on the counter-attack. 22 min \u201cCity\u2019s alternate kit reminds me of a Retirement Home director attempting to raise the senior\u2019s spirit with a new colour scheme in the dining hall,\u201d says Mary Waltz. \u201cIt simply causes nausea and confusion amongst the old folks.\u201d If only William Morris made football kits. 21 min Gundogan\u2019s relatively innocuous curler from 25 yards almost beats Hennessey. There must have been a deflection, because it ended up hitting Hennessey on the leg. 19 min A promising break from Palace is nipped in the bud when Fernandinho scoots across to reach the ball ahead of Zaha. 18 min \u201cDear Rob,\u201d says Michael Greville. \u201cMy thoughts have turned to the original title of Tom Wofle\u2019s first collection of essays, about custom cars apparently. \u2018There Goes (Varoom! Varoom!) That Kandy-Kolored (Thphhhhhh!) Tangerine-Flake Streamline Baby (Rahghhh!) Around the Bend (Brummmmmmmmmmmmmmm)\u2026\u2019. Perhaps not today, though. Colour-wise, although red v blue is good, I\u2019ve always though Liverpool v Wolves against bright green on a sunny day was best (but not with TV set to \u2018vivid\u2019)\u2018.\u201d I don\u2019t know what to thnk, never mind say. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever considered what might be the best combination of kits, never mind which TV setting I should use. 17 min Sterling plays a one-two with Gundogan, only to make a mess of his attempted volleyed cross. 16 min The corner is half cleared to Bernardo Silva on the right side of the box. He floats a curler towards the far corner that is flapped away by Hennessey, and Jesus heads the loose ball wide. 15 min Palace have been unable to get Zaha into the game. It\u2019s starting to feel like a City goal is coming. De Bruyne, found by a fine pass from Bernardo Silva, plays a typically devastating ball across the six-yard box that is put behind by Ward at the far post. 13 min Milivojevic gets his usual booking, this time for applying his boot to Gabriel Jesus\u2019s ankle. 11 min City are having at least 70 per cent of the possession, as at least 100 per cent of us expected, but they are yet to create a clear chance. Roy Hodgson\u2019s teams are invariably difficult to break down. 9 min \u201cJohn Stones has family problems,\u201d says Jon Heslop, \u201cso I imagine he\u2019s being eased back in while he sorts them out.\u201d Isn\u2019t it usually the case with personal issues that you either miss the match or don\u2019t, rather than being eased back in? I suppose it\u2019s hard to comment without knowing the nature of his problems. 7 min David Silva shoots straight at Hennessey from 20 yards. The chance came after a mistake from Milivojevic. 6 min \u201cObviously Pep will be frustrated at injuries to defenders, and I\u2019m sure he wouldn\u2019t wish ill on anyone,\u201d says Matt Dony. \u201cBut you just know there\u2019s a part of him that\u2019s absolutely over the (blue) moon at being able to field two extra midfielders. Moving inexorably towards his dream of 10-midfielder dominance.\u201d Ten? You\u2019ve forgotten the holding midfielder Ederson. 5 min De Bruyne\u2019s whipped first-time cross is headed over by the stretching Jesus beyond the far post. City look sharp with and especially without the ball. 4 min City, in their execrable ice-lolly away kit, have had most of the possession the first few minutes. Nothihg much to report. 2 min \u201cI see that Stones is on the bench, but not in the XI,\u201d says Seventh Horcrux. \u201cWhy put him on the bench while playing a CDM in his role instead? Is Stones not fully fit? If so, why put him on the bench at all? Doesn\u2019t make sense for a central defender to me. Am I missing something?\u201d He\u2019s been out for a month so he won\u2019t be match sharp. That said, in his interview Guardiola rambled a bit about there being another game in three days\u2019 time. If this was a title decider, I\u2019m sure Stones would have started. It has the feel of a Mourinho-style sulk selection, but only Pep knows. 1 min Peep peep! Palace kick off from left to right. The players emerge from the tunnel, ready for business. There\u2019s a superb atmosphere at Selhurst Park, which pound-for-pound is possibly the most atmospheric ground in the Premier League. \u201cRob, aren\u2019t football formations (just like assistant referees flagging offsides) outmoded nowadays?\u201d says Ravikiran Ramakrishnan. \u201cPep is playing with no centre-halves and played with Bernardo Silva at full back for one of the games last season. What\u2019s the point in pretending that us peasants understand Pep the football genius?\u201d I don\u2019t think they\u2019re outmoded. I do agree that tactics coverage \u2013 even from the best writers \u2013 can only get so close to what goes on behind closed doors. But tactics are much easier to write about than the things that have the biggest influence on the result of a football match: morale, man-management, the life of the mind, and whether the centre-forward had a sly Wimpy and chips on the way to the ground. Pep Guardiola is high on life \u201cRodri and Dinho will play in defence. [Is the key controlling the counter-attack and not letting their pacy players get at your defenders?] Well done. Congratulations. You can be manager. That is our dream but they have top players and we know how difficult it is.\u201d Pre-match reading In a surprising development, VAR has stuck its oar into most of this afternoon\u2019s matches. It sounds like Burnley have been the latest victims of football\u2019s all-singing, all-dancing kangaroo court. Manchester City are without Nicolas Otamendi and Kyle Walker, so they have a centre-back pairing of Fernandinho and Rodri. Oh I say! Crystal Palace (4-1-4-1) Hennessey; Ward, Cahill, Tomkins, van Aanholt; Milivojevic; Zaha, Kouyate, McArthur, Schlupp; Ayew. Substitutes: Henderson, Dann, McCarthy, Meyer, Townsend, Riedewald, Benteke, Manchester City (0-4-1-2-3) Ederson; Joao Cancelo, Fernandinho, Rodri, Mendy; Gundogan; De Bruyne, D Silva; B Silva, Jesus, Sterling. Substitutes: Bravo, Stones, Angelino, Garcia, Aguero, Mahrez, Foden. Referee Anthony Taylor. Hello. The last time Manchester City had a blip, they won 18 of the next 19 league games to pip Liverpool to the title. They will need produce the same murderous form over an even longer stretch if they are to reel Liverpool in this year. City have dropped eight points in eight games, which equals their worst start to a league season since the Abu Dhabi United Group takeover in 2008. Last season they dropped 16 points in 38 matches. All they can do is start winning again, then keep winning, and hope Liverpool get an almighty case of finishinglineitis. But it\u2019s not beyond the realms that the title race could be over by the time City leave Anfield on 10 November. Today\u2019s match certainly isn\u2019t a banker for City. Roy Hodgson\u2019s Crystal Palace are one of only two teams, Liverpool being the other, to take points off them in each of the last two seasons. That statistic is a reflection of how dominant City have been in recent times. Indeed, they\u2019ve won 79 of their last 100 Premier League games. I haven\u2019t had time to work out but that must be a seriously high win percentage. If they are to win a third consecutive title, it will probably need to be even higher. Kick off is at 5.30pm.",

It hit [Alli\u2019s] shoulder and I think it was legal. I can understand for Watford, they must feel so, so bad.\u201d",

Could the prime minister really defy the law on an extension to force his pig-in-lipstick deal through?</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/19/voices-from-peoples-vote-march\">Voices from the People\u2019s Vote march</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>There had been plenty of good reasons not to travel from the country\u2019s four corners to march in the capital: the rugby, the money, the ennui. And above all there had been the danger that the timing might make it all futile anyhow. That \u2013 by the time marchers reached Parliament Square\u2013 the demand for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/12/keir-starmer-brexit-deal-unlikely-pass-without-confirmatory-referendum-interview\" title=\"\">confirmatory referendum</a> would have finally been thwarted, and the latest million man-woman-and-child march would turn into a wake or a vigil. But the marchers turned up anyway, and they were, under darkening skies, rewarded with yet another possible hint of light.</p> \n<p>The prime minister had attempted to choreograph his \u201cSuper Saturday\u201d session of parliament in the tradition of previous crisis-sittings, those that had assembled for debate about war in 1939 and conflict in Suez in 1956 and the Falklands in 1982.</p> \n<p>This time, in Johnson\u2019s telling, the battle lines were drawn between parliament and the people. By \u201cpeople\u201d Johnson meant that section of the population identified by Nigel Farage on the morning after the referendum vote when, in announcing his poundshop \u201cindependence day\u201d, he had talked of Brexit as a victory for \u201creal people, a victory for ordinary people, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/24/nigel-farage-ugliness-bullet-fired\" title=\"\">a victory for decent people</a>.\u201d</p> \n<p>Among the most dangerous themes of that politics of division has been to tell some parts of the population that they are more grounded here in blood and in soil than others. The hundreds of thousands of very real people determined to march once more in London told a very different, more inclusive, island story. One that cuts across borders of politics and circumstance and region. And if ministers had wanted to see the will of those people in full force, they could have looked out of the windows of the Palace of Westminster.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a2edd34f-10d4-4bb8-8c2b-435bbd60a78d\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JYqqcOxGeNA?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>They would have seen people like Dave Blackburn, 62, a support worker for autistic adults, who had come down with a small group overnight on the bus from Glasgow. \u201cIt was getting down to the wire and I still thought there was a chance of a second vote,\u201d Blackburn told me before the march set off. \u201cMy friends are mostly for Scottish independence, and whatever happens I think that battle will now be won. But I think this, leaving the EU, will anyway be a disaster for working people.\u201d</p> \n<p>His fellow sleepless traveller Sheila Connolly, who works with young homeless people, laughed at how their bus down had been advertised with reclining seats \u201cbut that only seemed to apply to seats in front of you\u201d. She had to be here because she would be devastated if Johnson\u2019s deal passed. \u201cI don\u2019t care what they say, this is another way for them to come for working people,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>Or the politicians might have seen Emmanuelle Brook, a teaching assistant in her 40s with two children, among 500 people up from Cornwall. Brook, born in France, has lived in the UK for 24 years. \u201cWe came here on a set of rules we thought would last, and now I have been made a foreigner again,\u201d she said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4e0caeb521b85abc9c1be0230682f68dfb333cdd\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4e0caeb521b85abc9c1be0230682f68dfb333cdd/0_78_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters came from all demographics.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters came from all demographics.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Corban/Rex/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cI get asked where I am from all the time.\u201d She had been scared about today, had the deal been ratified. \u201cNot just the economics but the human impact of Brexit.

Not for the first time in recent years it was as if the world inside the chamber bore no relation to that outside its doors, a Westminster bubble indeed. Among the marchers there was, oddly, a similar lack of curiosity about the progress of the debates happening up the road, a sense that everything that could have been said on the subject had long since been said, and that it was now a stubborn numbers game of ayes and noes.</p> \n<p>The turnout of marchers, coaches and buses from all over, and their mostly irrepressible good humour, once again provided an alternative set of figures to contemplate. Despite the <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/jacob-reesmogg-and-his-young-son-heckled-by-protesters-a4265876.html\" title=\"\">heckling of Andrea Leadsom and Jacob Rees-Mogg</a>, who was with his young son, as they left the Commons, this may well be the most good-natured and well-mannered of protest movements the country has ever mustered, but no one should doubt its determination.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6888bfe8eb5f2413fc36971f2316a91d51779030\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6888bfe8eb5f2413fc36971f2316a91d51779030/0_289_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An effigy depicting Boris Johnson as a puppet operated by his adviser Dominic Cummings.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An effigy depicting Boris Johnson as a puppet operated by his adviser Dominic Cummings.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Isabel Infantes/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The thousands on the streets in this most British of rebellions was testament to the persistence of that constituency who still believe that \u201cjust get it done\u201d is not a basis on which to run a parliamentary democracy. And, like Oliver Letwin, that four hours is not long enough to scrutinise the most significant piece of legislation in a generation.</p> \n<p>Talk to almost any one of that number and you would be hard-pressed to make a case against the idea that, at heart, Brexit has become an assault on the salt of the earth.

      "bodyText": "As the news of the success of the Letwin amendment filtered out to the hundreds of thousands who had once again marched to Parliament Square to demand a People\u2019s Vote on the Brexit deal, there was the most reassuringly British of reactions: widespread applause in the rain. Throaty cheers and whistles gave way to nuanced conversations from under umbrellas and the hoods of cagoules as to what might happen next. Could the prime minister really defy the law on an extension to force his pig-in-lipstick deal through? There had been plenty of good reasons not to travel from the country\u2019s four corners to march in the capital: the rugby, the money, the ennui. And above all there had been the danger that the timing might make it all futile anyhow. That \u2013 by the time marchers reached Parliament Square\u2013 the demand for a confirmatory referendum would have finally been thwarted, and the latest million man-woman-and-child march would turn into a wake or a vigil. But the marchers turned up anyway, and they were, under darkening skies, rewarded with yet another possible hint of light. The prime minister had attempted to choreograph his \u201cSuper Saturday\u201d session of parliament in the tradition of previous crisis-sittings, those that had assembled for debate about war in 1939 and conflict in Suez in 1956 and the Falklands in 1982. This time, in Johnson\u2019s telling, the battle lines were drawn between parliament and the people. By \u201cpeople\u201d Johnson meant that section of the population identified by Nigel Farage on the morning after the referendum vote when, in announcing his poundshop \u201cindependence day\u201d, he had talked of Brexit as a victory for \u201creal people, a victory for ordinary people, a victory for decent people.\u201d Among the most dangerous themes of that politics of division has been to tell some parts of the population that they are more grounded here in blood and in soil than others. The hundreds of thousands of very real people determined to march once more in London told a very different, more inclusive, island story. One that cuts across borders of politics and circumstance and region. And if ministers had wanted to see the will of those people in full force, they could have looked out of the windows of the Palace of Westminster. They would have seen people like Dave Blackburn, 62, a support worker for autistic adults, who had come down with a small group overnight on the bus from Glasgow. \u201cIt was getting down to the wire and I still thought there was a chance of a second vote,\u201d Blackburn told me before the march set off. \u201cMy friends are mostly for Scottish independence, and whatever happens I think that battle will now be won. But I think this, leaving the EU, will anyway be a disaster for working people.\u201d His fellow sleepless traveller Sheila Connolly, who works with young homeless people, laughed at how their bus down had been advertised with reclining seats \u201cbut that only seemed to apply to seats in front of you\u201d. She had to be here because she would be devastated if Johnson\u2019s deal passed. \u201cI don\u2019t care what they say, this is another way for them to come for working people,\u201d she said. Or the politicians might have seen Emmanuelle Brook, a teaching assistant in her 40s with two children, among 500 people up from Cornwall. Brook, born in France, has lived in the UK for 24 years. \u201cWe came here on a set of rules we thought would last, and now I have been made a foreigner again,\u201d she said. \u201cI get asked where I am from all the time.\u201d She had been scared about today, had the deal been ratified. \u201cNot just the economics but the human impact of Brexit. I may be safe here, but I no longer feel it.\u201d Strangely, as the debates unfolded and the march once again inched toward its destination, there appeared to be no mention of the presence of its massed ranks at the government dispatch box. Not for the first time in recent years it was as if the world inside the chamber bore no relation to that outside its doors, a Westminster bubble indeed. Among the marchers there was, oddly, a similar lack of curiosity about the progress of the debates happening up the road, a sense that everything that could have been said on the subject had long since been said, and that it was now a stubborn numbers game of ayes and noes. The turnout of marchers, coaches and buses from all over, and their mostly irrepressible good humour, once again provided an alternative set of figures to contemplate. Despite the heckling of Andrea Leadsom and Jacob Rees-Mogg, who was with his young son, as they left the Commons, this may well be the most good-natured and well-mannered of protest movements the country has ever mustered, but no one should doubt its determination. The thousands on the streets in this most British of rebellions was testament to the persistence of that constituency who still believe that \u201cjust get it done\u201d is not a basis on which to run a parliamentary democracy. And, like Oliver Letwin, that four hours is not long enough to scrutinise the most significant piece of legislation in a generation. Talk to almost any one of that number and you would be hard-pressed to make a case against the idea that, at heart, Brexit has become an assault on the salt of the earth. Judith Spencer, who spent her career as a psychologist on the civil servants\u2019 appointment board, is 79; she is walking with the \u201cIn Limbo\u201d group of EU citizens and UK citizens in Europe, the five million who still live with willed uncertainty. \u201cI was born here half-Japanese in 1940,\u201d Spencer tells me. \u201cAnd I encountered discrimination from the word go. To see mature professional Europeans who have made their lives here suffering discrimination in this country now really horrified me. Hearing that their kids are being terrorised in the playgrounds. I can feel the country moving backwards.\u201d By now, among seasoned marchers, there are few new placards under the sun, but there seemed more saltires and Welsh dragons and county flags alongside EU flags and Union Jacks this time, as people asserted what should never have been in doubt: that all citizens enjoy layers of identity. In among these banners, there was the usual smattering of blunt regional aphorism. A party from Aberdeen had gone with the straightforward \u201cBoris is a Bawbag\u201d. Those from Stratford had chosen a quote from The Tempest \u201cbless our Europe\u201d. Then there was \u201cBramm orth Brexit\u201d, which translated, I was reliably informed, with apologies to Monty Python, as \u201cI fart in Brexit\u2019s general direction.\u201d Cassie Histed, a warehouse worker from Warwick, is amused and heartened by the good cheer of the march, the fact that it represents all ages and classes.

She has always identified herself, she tells me, as part of the Sea-Green society which traces its history of protest back to the Levellers of the English civil war.

They may snigger about the commitment of people who are angry at the railroading of our politics but who are not, by nature, angry people. They might, too, however, reflect on the fact that, in three-and-a-half years, the most notable collective showings of Brexit voters has been the 29 March \u201cBrexit Day\u201d gathering, dominated by the intelligentsia of the Football Lads\u2019 Alliance and their arthritic desire for a ruck in the name of Engerlund. Martyn Cattermole, a retired management consultant, who was marching with his family, has discovered many things in the course of protests over the last year. One of them is that a hollowed-out Pringles tube makes a very effective loud hailer.

      "bodyText": "Championship Leeds, who marked their centenary on Thursday, climbed into second after a 1-0 victory over Birmingham at Elland Road. Kalvin Phillips\u2019 65th minute goal, set up by Jack Harrison, proved to be the winner. Marcelo Bielsa\u2019s team sit behind only West Brom, who won 1-0 at Middlesbrough. With a 1-1 draw against Barnsley at Oakwell, Swansea dropped two points and the chance to finish the day above Leeds and fourth-placed Nottingham Forest, who play at Wigan on Sunday. Jordan Ayew\u2019s 67th minute header put Swans ahead, only for Alex Mowatt to equalise three minutes later. QPR are up to fifth after coming out on top in a five-goal thriller at Hull that saw ten minutes of injury time. Eberechi Eze\u2019s two penalties, the second coming in the 88th minute after he had been the attacking player fouled, proved decisive. Preston dropped to sixth after losing 1-0 to Reading. Royals manager Mark Bowen got a win in first game in charge with the American Matt Miazga scoring the winner from close range in the eighth minute of time added on. Charlton are now seventh, level on points with Preston, after a convincingly beating Derby 3-0. The Rams drop to 15th with pressure growing on manager Phillip Cocu. Bristol City\u2019s push for promotion - and their ten-match unbeaten run \u2013 came to an end as they were beaten 3-0 at Luton, for whom Pelly-Ruddock Mpanzu opened the scoring before Harry Cornick scored the second and Ashley Williams put through his own net for the third. In the division\u2019s lower reaches, Stoke climbed from the foot of the table with a 1-0 win over Fulham, a second victory in succession easing some of the doubts around manager Nathan Jones\u2019 future at the Bet365 Stadium.

Josh Dasilva scored in the 84th minute, then Bryan Mbeumo equalised four minutes later and then had a hand in Ollie Watkins\u2019 winner four minutes into injury time. League One With leaders Ipswich at Accrington on Sunday, their chasers had chance to make up ground. Wycombe remain second after Darius Charles\u2019s winner was enough to ruin Phil Parkinson\u2019s first match in charge of Sunderland, who dropped to tenth in the table. Peterborough\u2019s 2-1 win at Gillingham, which came after a goal from Joe Ward and a Mohamed Eisa penalty kept them in third. Fleetwood moved into fourth with a 4-1 defeat of Burton in which striker Paddy Madden completed his hat-trick in the 90th minute after Ched Evans had opened the scoring. Oxford\u2019s 2-1 win at Rotherham and Coventry\u2019s 0-0 draw with MK Dons moved them into fifth and sixth respectively. At the bottom, AFC Wimbledon continued their recent revival by climbing out of the bottom three. Terell Thomas headed home the only goal of game and winner against Portsmouth in the third minute of time added on at Kingsmeadow. An 85th-minute penalty from substitute Paul Mullin earned Tranmere a point at second-bottom Southend while Bolton remain rock-bottom and still on -8 points after a 3-1 Lancashire derby defeat to Rochdale. League Two Crewe stayed top after a 3-1 defeat of Swindon, in which Chris Porter scored twice. They are joined in the automatic promotion slots by Bradford, who beat Crawley 2-1, and Newport, who celebrated a 2-1 home win over Scunthorpe. Swindon\u2019s defeat dropped them to seventh in the table, the final automatic promotion slot for which there a few contenders. Plymouth\u2019s 2-0 defeat of Carlisle has them just a point behind the Robins, with Macclesfield sitting ninth only on goal difference after Jak McCourt\u2019s 86th minuter winner at Oldham kept up the Silkmen\u2019s recent revival. Cambridge are just a further point back after crushing Exeter 4-0. At the bottom, Morecambe\u2019s 1-0 win at Carlisle vaulted them above Stevenage, who occupy the sole relegation spot after they could only draw 1-1 at Port Vale. Alongside Cambridge, Leyton Orient were the big winners of the day, enjoying a 4-0 seaside stroll at Grimsby.",

Jennifer Arcuri had driven him mad by insisting he stick to Google Hangouts when he\u2019d been dying to move on to spreadsheets.

It took some skill to go back to Brussels and negotiate an even worse withdrawal agreement than Theresa May, but somehow \u2013 against all the odds \u2013 he had defied the gloomsters and pulled it off. So this was to have been his Super Saturday. A day to go down in the history books, when parliament met for the first time on a weekend in 37 years and he, the World King, would be carried aloft along the Tory benches as the \u201cMan who Delivered Brexit\u201d. OK, it would almost certainly be a short-lived triumph once everyone realised that he\u2019d promised polar opposites to different groups of MPs and the real arguments would only emerge once the UK had left the EU, but he could live with that.

People think differently now, after being misled in 2016, and we should have the opportunity to say: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to do this any more. We don\u2019t want to compound our errors.\u201d You only need to look at what\u2019s happened to the pound to see how much faith people have that the current administration can negotiate a better trade deal than what we\u2019ve got.

All my life I\u2019ve ignored that type of newspaper and thought: \u201cIt\u2019s just words.\u201d But it turns out that words matter. Andrew Lee, 35 from Toronto, lives in London, works in finance I have dual British-Canadian citizenship. I feel a second referendum is the only way to get out of the deadlock, irrespective of one\u2019s preference for leave or remain because we need a steer from the people, now that three years have passed and the goalposts have moved. People think differently now, after being misled in 2016, and we should have the opportunity to say: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to do this any more. We don\u2019t want to compound our errors.\u201d You only need to look at what\u2019s happened to the pound to see how much faith people have that the current administration can negotiate a better trade deal than what we\u2019ve got. Fundamentally, the question is: What is the path forward for this country and this people? And the three administrations in the last three years have been unable to pull us out of this quagmire.",

He has written two autobiographical novels, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/jul/16/fiction.features2\" title=\"\"><em>In </em><em>the Country of Men</em></a> (2006) and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/mar/06/hisham-matar-anatomy-disappearance-libya\" title=\"\"><em>Anatomy of a Disappearance</em></a> (2011). Both are about a boy growing up in Cairo and Tripoli, as did Matar, and the abduction of the boy\u2019s father from Egypt, where he had fled from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/muammar-gaddafi\" title=\"\">Muammar Gaddafi</a>\u2019s regime. This is what happened to Matar\u2019s father, the Libyan activist Jaballa Matar, in 1990. He was never seen again. Hisham Matar\u2019s memoir, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jul/03/hisham-matar-the-return-review\" title=\"\"><em>The Return</em></a> (2016), which won many prizes including the Pulitzer and the Folio, was about the author\u2019s journey back to Libya 25 years later, after the overthrow of Gaddafi, to try to find out what happened to his father. His new book, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/a-month-in-siena-9780241409503.html\" title=\"\"><em>A Month </em><em>in Siena</em></a>, is a brief memoir set in the time between the completion of <em>The Return</em> and its publication. It describes a lone trip to the city to see its paintings and find a way ahead.</p> <p><strong>In the book you relate how you became </strong><strong>transfixed</strong><strong> by the Sienese school of paintings at the National Gallery in London at the age of </strong><strong>19</strong><strong>. What </strong><strong>is it about the works of </strong><strong>Lorenzetti</strong><strong>, </strong><strong>Di Pietro</strong><strong> and </strong><strong>Di Paolo</strong><strong> that you </strong><strong>find so bewitching?</strong><br>At the time, I\u2019d just lost my father in a way that was very dramatic and overwhelming, but also secret. I couldn\u2019t talk about it. So I think my reaction to the Sienese paintings was connected to that. They attended in some way to my desire for straightforwardness. There\u2019s something wonderfully rudimentary about them and sort of uncluttered; they seemed to come from a different world and to be very open and questioning and not satisfied. That was very appealing to me. It was exactly how I was feeling: I wasn\u2019t feeling open, I wasn\u2019t satisfied.</p> <p><strong>How important were museums and galleries to you growing up?</strong><br>If I hadn\u2019t had access to them or to public libraries, my whole life would be different. I had no money so museums were not only a place that provided ideas and pleasure and culture, but also a refuge, a place where I could be warm, where I could spend my lunch hour. As a student I would go to the National Gallery at lunchtime and eat my sandwiches in front of a particular picture every day for one week. Then the next week, I would go on to another picture. I enjoyed the fact that I had a destination, and so the picture I was looking at became like an encounter with someone who told you certain things on that day that they hadn\u2019t on the day before. It is a habit that remains with me. Sometimes I spend a couple of months looking at one picture in a gallery, sometimes a year.</p> <p><strong>A whole year looking at one picture?</strong><br>Pretty much. For example, I\u2019m now looking at a picture at the Metropolitan Museum by Velazquez of a man who used to be his slave, <a href=\"https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/437869\" title=\"\">Juan de Pareja</a>. De Pareja was Arab, and he was owned by Velazquez but he was a very good painter and Velazquez liked and admired him and gave him his liberty. It\u2019s a complex picture because it\u2019s a picture of two people who are not equal in society, but who are each other\u2019s equal as human beings. With the pictures that sustain my interest, like this one, there\u2019s so much in them, so much that is variable and contingent and complex.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There was suddenly a very strong sense of conviction that he was dead. I was able to accept it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>You describe in your memoir how, over the years, Siena began to occupy for you the same sort of \u201cuneasy reverence\u201d the devout might feel towards Mecca, Rome or Jerusalem. How did it feel to arrive in the city after 25 years of yearning for it?</strong><br><strong> </strong></p> <p>It felt allegorical. By which I mean, the city felt almost like an imaginative space, a metaphor that could lend itself to me. I think these kinds of encounters happen very rarely. Perhaps each one of us is on a certain kind of trajectory, where we encounter certain books, people, places, works of art. At a certain moment, we and they seem to light up and come alive. I\u2019ve come across some wonderful works of art, books and people, too, but at the wrong moment, and nothing happens. And then, under different circumstances, it\u2019s like you see them for the first time, something about them has become available to you. Being in Siena was that sort of magical encounter where I felt enlivened and I also felt that the place was enlivened by my curiosity, that it was responding.</p> <p><strong>At some point during your visit you realised Siena had become a place to grieve for your father, whom you had been unable to find when you went to Libya. Could you tell me a bit more about that?</strong><br>One of complications in not knowing for sure what happened to my father is that you don\u2019t know exactly where the boundary is between your hope to find him alive and your need to mourn his death. I felt in Siena that I had arrived at this place. There was suddenly a very strong sense of conviction that he was dead. I was able to accept it and I was also confronted with the very strong probability that I will never be able to find his remains or find out how it happened.</p> <p><strong>Does writing come easily to you?</strong><br>Writing is both the easiest thing and the most difficult thing. What makes it the one or the other for me remains uncertain. I know some of the things that increase the chances of it being easier.</p> <p><strong>What sort of things?</strong><br>When I\u2019m not making it about myself. This thing I used to do of thinking, I wrote a terrible paragraph and therefore I\u2019m a terrible person, a terrible writer, I\u2019m crushed \u2013 it\u2019s very inappropriate and narcissistic. One should go to one\u2019s work with a feeling of being in service, a mixture of humility and gratitude, and not be wanting it to pat you on the back.</p> <p><strong>What books are on your bedside table?</strong><br>I don\u2019t have a big pile on my bedside table. Before I sleep I read very little and usually poetry. At the moment it is the collected works of <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/wallace-stevens\" title=\"\">Wallace Stevens</a> because I am very fond of him. I find his work so subtle and miraculous. I\u2019d like to say I am reading a new poet who nobody knows but\u2026</p> <p><strong>Which novelists and nonfiction writers working today do you most admire</strong><strong>?</strong><br>Novelists: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/petercarey\" title=\"\">Peter Carey</a> for his great energy and discipline; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/oct/12/javier-marias-books-that-made-me-knausgaard\" title=\"\">Javier Mar\u00edas</a> for intelligence and ideas; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/colmtoibin\" title=\"\">Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn</a> for his depth of feeling, precision and elegance; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/21/i-initially-thought-it-would-be-about-the-season-ali-smith-on-writing-autumn\" title=\"\">Ali Smith</a> for her mind and style; the essays of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jun/01/adam-phillips-life-in-writing\" title=\"\">Adam Phillips</a> for their freedom, Svetlana Alpers on art, and the poetry of Christian Wiman.</p> <p><strong>What is the last really great book you read?</strong><br>I am doing a lot of rereading because I am teaching [at Barnard College, part of Columbia University, New York]. At the moment it is WG Sebald, Svetlana Alexievich and Joseph Conrad and that has been just fantastic. I have also been rereading Proust, <em>In Search of Lost Time</em> \u2013 all the books in the series. I find Proust amazing.</p> <p><strong>Does teaching feed into your writing?</strong><br>I only teach one semester a year but I find it wonderful because you learn a lot and nothing cheers me up more than a roomful of bright young minds who don\u2019t need convincing: they\u2019ve arrived, they want to read, they want to learn. The classroom becomes a place of endless possibility. It\u2019s an antidote to the politicians we have and what\u2019s happening in the world around us.</p> <p><strong>Is there a classic novel you are ashamed not to have read?</strong><br>I haven\u2019t read a lot of things. I am a slow reader. But I feel no shame, just excitement at the idea that there are all these gems around us, not just books but paintings and music, that we haven\u2019t yet come to.</p> <p><strong>What kind of reader were you as a child?</strong><br>I read a lot of poetry. The first novel I read outside of the obligation to read it for school was when I was 18. I sometimes believed then \u2013 and I was wrong \u2013 that prose was a lesser form of literature, that if you really wanted to read proper stuff you read poetry.</p> <p><strong>What book would you give to a young person?</strong><br>I love those very early short stories of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/aug/13/short-story-survey-italo-calvino\" title=\"\">Italo Calvino</a>. They\u2019re about a page or two long and are always about a moment where a principle is turned upside down. They\u2019re so clever and funny. I used to read them to my nephews when they were young.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s the best book you ever received as a present?</strong><br>My wife, the artist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/nov/12/evidence-libya-gaddafi-dead-disappeared-diana-matar\" title=\"\">Diana Matar</a>, made a single-edition book for me of 100 photographic images she took across Libya. The volume is singular in both senses of the word.</p> <p><em>\u2022 A Month in Siena </em>by Hisham Matar is published by Penguin (\u00a312.99).

This thing I used to do of thinking, I wrote a terrible paragraph and therefore I\u2019m a terrible person, a terrible writer, I\u2019m crushed \u2013 it\u2019s very inappropriate and narcissistic. One should go to one\u2019s work with a feeling of being in service, a mixture of humility and gratitude, and not be wanting it to pat you on the back. What books are on your bedside table? I don\u2019t have a big pile on my bedside table. Before I sleep I read very little and usually poetry. At the moment it is the collected works of Wallace Stevens because I am very fond of him. I find his work so subtle and miraculous. I\u2019d like to say I am reading a new poet who nobody knows but\u2026 Which novelists and nonfiction writers working today do you most admire? Novelists: Peter Carey for his great energy and discipline; Javier Mar\u00edas for intelligence and ideas; Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn for his depth of feeling, precision and elegance; Ali Smith for her mind and style; the essays of Adam Phillips for their freedom, Svetlana Alpers on art, and the poetry of Christian Wiman. What is the last really great book you read? I am doing a lot of rereading because I am teaching [at Barnard College, part of Columbia University, New York]. At the moment it is WG Sebald, Svetlana Alexievich and Joseph Conrad and that has been just fantastic. I have also been rereading Proust, In Search of Lost Time \u2013 all the books in the series. I find Proust amazing. Does teaching feed into your writing? I only teach one semester a year but I find it wonderful because you learn a lot and nothing cheers me up more than a roomful of bright young minds who don\u2019t need convincing: they\u2019ve arrived, they want to read, they want to learn. The classroom becomes a place of endless possibility. It\u2019s an antidote to the politicians we have and what\u2019s happening in the world around us. Is there a classic novel you are ashamed not to have read? I haven\u2019t read a lot of things. I am a slow reader. But I feel no shame, just excitement at the idea that there are all these gems around us, not just books but paintings and music, that we haven\u2019t yet come to. What kind of reader were you as a child? I read a lot of poetry. The first novel I read outside of the obligation to read it for school was when I was 18. I sometimes believed then \u2013 and I was wrong \u2013 that prose was a lesser form of literature, that if you really wanted to read proper stuff you read poetry. What book would you give to a young person? I love those very early short stories of Italo Calvino. They\u2019re about a page or two long and are always about a moment where a principle is turned upside down. They\u2019re so clever and funny. I used to read them to my nephews when they were young. What\u2019s the best book you ever received as a present? My wife, the artist Diana Matar, made a single-edition book for me of 100 photographic images she took across Libya. The volume is singular in both senses of the word. \u2022 A Month in Siena by Hisham Matar is published by Penguin (\u00a312.99). To order a copy go to guardianbookshop.com or call 020-3176 3837.

      "bodyText": "Thank you for following the blog today and for all your comments. Here is a summary of the day\u2019s main developments. Boris Johnson has until 11pm to request an extension to Brexit from the EU after losing a vote on an amendment tabled by Oliver Letwin. The Letwin amendment, which puts a brake on Brexit, was passed by 322 votes to 306. The prime minister insisted he would \u201cnot negotiate a delay with the EU, and neither does the law compel me to do so\u201d. Jeremy Corbyn told him he must comply with the law and the SNP\u2019s Ian Blackford warned Johnson could end up in court. The leader of the house, Jacob Rees-Mogg, said another meaningful vote would be held on Monday. But the Speaker, John Bercow, indicated he might not allow this as it would be \u201ccurious or irregular\u201d attempt to \u201cinvalidate\u201d the result of today\u2019s vote. Bercow also indicated that he could write the letter to the EU requesting an extension if instructed to by a judge or MPs. No 10 has yet to clarify whether Johnson will send the letter. The People\u2019s Vote campaign claims 1 million people have joined a march in London demanding they get a say on any Brexit deal. John McDonnell, Caroline Lucas and Anna Soubry were among those who addressed the crowds after the parliamentary vote. Here\u2019s what Gina Miller \u2013 who has won two legal challenges against the government over Brexit \u2013 said about today. Police are stood round a group singing Rule Britannia, chanting: \u201cOh Tommy Tommy (Robinson)\u201d and calling for a no-deal Brexit as pro-EU protesters are singing: \u201cBollocks to Brexit.\u201d The shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, also needed a police escort today. In her case it was after addressing the People\u2019s Vote march and being followed by pro-Brexit supporters. Another response, this time from the the taoiseach: Here is what the European parliament\u2019s representative on Brexit has said about today\u2019s events: The leader of the house, Jacob Rees-Mogg, has also been given a police escort leaving parliament. The business secretary, Andrea Leadsom, was escorted by police as she left the House of Commons to the sound of protesters on the People\u2019s Vote march shouting: \u201cShame on you.\u201d Having left the Commons after the Letwin amendment was passed, a number of MPs have been addressing the People\u2019s Vote march. The decision by MPs to pass the Letwin amendment brings the legal action against the prime minister which resumes on Monday in Scotland\u2019s highest civil court into sharp relief. The court of session will resume its hearing into a request for an emergency interdict, or injunction, to force Johnson to send the Brexit extension letter required by the Benn act. Johnson told the Commons on Saturday he was not legally required to do so \u2013 a position the court is now likely to test on Monday. Ten days ago, Scotland\u2019s most senior judge, Lord Carloway, sitting with Lords Drummond-Young and Brodie, postponed a decision on enforcing the act\u2019s provisions because they did not then know whether Johnson would have to uphold its provisions or would fail to do so. That case, brought by Dale Vince, the millionaire owner of the Ecotricity green energy company, Jolyon Maugham QC, the anti-Brexit campaigner, and Joanna Cherry QC, the SNP MP will resume at noon on Monday. If Johnson has failed to send the letter as required, by 11pm tonight, the court is expected to rule on Monday on whether to give Johnson 24 hours to do so or face being held in contempt of court. Legal sources believe the prime minister is in significant legal peril. Lawyers for the UK government told the court on 9 October they knew the solemn pledges given at an earlier hearing that Johnson would comply with the act were legally binding. The UK government told the court of session on Friday 4 October the prime minister accepted \u201che is subject to the public law principle that he cannot frustrate its purpose or the purpose of its provisions. Thus he cannot act so as to prevent the letter requesting the specified extension in the act from being sent.\u201d And the court will also adjudicate on a second part of the application: an interdict forcing the UK government not to frustrate or undermine the intent of the letter, by attempting to sidestep the extension move. If he or his ministers, or their proxies, try to subvert the request for an extension \u2013 say by sending a second letter asking the EU to ignore the extension application, they will also be at risk of contempt. It is only if Johnson fails to send the letter and fails to adhere to the court\u2019s interdict requiring him to do so that the court will consider the nuclear option. It has unique powers called nobile officium, which allow the court or its agent to send that letter to all 27 EU member states and institutions on Johnson\u2019s behalf. Those powers have never been used in such a way, and if the Scottish court uses them, it would provoke another extraordinary constitutional confrontation. Assuming the court issues a definitive ruling next week, the case is expected to end up in the UK supreme court within days. Proceedings in the House of Commons have now been adjourned after a lengthy discussion about what happens next following the government\u2019s defeat on the Letwin amendment. Many opposition MPs were unhappy at the prospect of the government tabling another meaningful vote for Monday. It was unclear whether the Speaker, John Bercow, would grant this. Last year, the Speaker said the government could not keep bringing back the same question to parliament in the hope that they got a different answer. The independent - former Labour - MP Jared O\u2019Mara voted for the Letwin amendment, as did the vast majority of Labour MPs. The leader of the house, Jacob Rees-Mogg, suggested there could be a meaningful vote on the Brexit deal on Monday. This was then supported by Oliver Letwin, whose amendment prevented it happening today. But it is for the Speaker, John Bercow, to decide whether to allow that motion on Monday and he gave the strongest indication he would not. Earlier, as the benches emptied out after the vote, the SNP\u2019s Joanna Cherry QC asked Bercow if he would write the letter requesting an extension if the prime minister did not do so. He said he would do so if asked by the judge or MPs. Here is what the Conservatives are saying: A spokeswoman for the European commission said it was up to the UK government to make the next move after the developments in the Commons. She said: The European commission takes note of the vote in the House of Commons today on the so-called Letwin amendment meaning that the withdrawal agreement itself was not put to vote today. It will be for the UK government to inform us about the next steps as soon as possible. A spokesman for the European council president, Donald Tusk, declined to comment. Ambassadors for the EU27 will meet on Sunday morning to discuss the latest developments. More from the march ... Boris Johnson has until 11pm to send that extension letter to the EU. Organisers of the \u201cpeople\u2019s vote\u201d march say there are 1 million people in attendance, my colleague Aamna Mohdin tells me. Here is Boris Johnson\u2019s response to the government defeat on the amendment: You can see how everyone voted here. As they go on debating whether the PM can be forced to write the letter to the EU requesting an extension, No 10 is keeping mum. This was the reaction on the \u201cpeople\u2019s vote\u201d march: Here is a celebratory selfie by a Lib Dem MP with the Green party\u2019s Caroline Lucas. Oliver Letwin says he will be voting for the deal with the intention that the UK leaves the EU on 31 October, and can now do so with the knowledge that if the bill does not pass in time, the UK will not crash out. The DUP\u2019s Nigel Dodds says the party will examine the deal in detail and its priority will remain the integrity of the union. The Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson, says the deal is a bad deal and the public deserve to have a say. The most urgent thing now is that the prime minister complies with the law. She asks for parliament to be suspended so that Boris Johnson can send a letter asking the EU for a suspension and then come back to parliament and confirm that he has sent it. This request is declined by the Speaker. Corbyn calls on Johnson to reconsider what he has said about not asking for an extension. The SNP\u2019s leader in Westminster, Ian Blackford, asks the Speaker what can be done to ensure the government complies with the law and the Benn act. Blackford says Johnson thinks \u201che\u2019s above the law\u201d but will find himself in court if he doesn\u2019t abide by it. The PM says it was \u201cpretty close\u201d today and he hopes MPs will accept his deal next week in \u201coverwhelming numbers\u201d. I continue to commend this deal to the house. Jeremy Corbyn says that parliament has spoken. It is an emphatic decision by this house ... The prime minister must now comply with the law. He says Johnson can no longer use the threat of a no-deal crash-out to blackmail MPs. Boris Johnson thanks everyone for giving up their time but says \u201calas\u201d, the opportunity to have a meaningful vote has been passed up. He says he is not dismayed by the result. He continues in the strong belief that the best thing for the UK and the EU is to leave on 31 October. I will not negotiate a delay with the EU and neither does the law compel me to do so. The legislation will be introduced next week, says Johnson. The government loses. 322 to 306. This withholds approval of the prime minister\u2019s deal until the legislation to enact it \u2013 the EU withdrawal bill \u2013 is passed. Labour think they\u2019ve won... Here\u2019s what people are saying about the Letwin amendment vote: MPs are now voting on the Letwin amendment. Michael Gove is up taking a conciliatory tone, stressing that he accepts everyone is acting in what he thinks are the best interests of the country. But he says those he respects most are those from both benches who voted to remain but now are voting for the deal because it is the will of the British people. On that basis, he says the speech that stood out was that by Theresa May who voted for remain but now wants to honour the result of the referendum. Gove says MPs should be prepared to put aside \u201cour perfect Brexit\u201d for the sake of the common good. He says if there is a vote to delay people will feel that parliament has shirked its responsibilities. Asked a question about how the government will avoid a no deal if it is passed but legislation is not passed on time, Gove says the best way to avoid that is to vote for the government\u2019s deal. If the amendment is passed there will be no meaningful vote today, he says. If parliament votes for the deal unamended people will feel \u201clike a cloud has lifted\u201d, he claims. Another Tory who had the whip withdrawn has confirmed he will vote for Boris Johnson\u2019s deal. As the Brexit debate continues, so do Ukip\u2019s travails. It has taken steps to suspend its leader, Richard Braine, amid a fresh power struggle within the party, my colleague Aaron Walawalkar writes. A man has been arrested for trespass within the Palace of Westminster. Antoinette Sandbach, who had the Tory whip withdrawn last month, says she will back the Letwin amendment. Making the point that she has voted for a Brexit deal more times than the prime minister, she says Johnson\u2019s deal is \u201csubstantially worse\u201d: I\u2019m not saying much about the deal. I was always taught that if you have nothing nice to say, say nothing. She also says she would vote for an amendment in favour of a \u201cpeople\u2019s vote\u201d if there was an opportunity to do so. The Lib Dems\u2019 Tom Brake says the PM is a \u201ccolourful Pied Piper\u201d who struck the deal to further his own ambition. Brake says Boris Johnson himself has said the deal may not survive the transition period and could still lead to a no-deal crash-out. He advocates a people\u2019s vote, referencing \u201cthe hundreds of thousands of people over there in Parliament Square\u201d. Brake urges MPs to support the Letwin amendment and reject the deal. The Tory MP and former cabinet member Liam Fox says the amendment will not take EU off the table, as the government would be forced to ask the EU for any extension. The only way to prevent no deal is to vote for the PM\u2019s deal, says Fox. He says the government made a contract with the British people. It\u2019s a question of faith in our electoral system itself. He says he has \u201cstrong reservations\u201d about the deal but it\u2019s time to deliver. Fox also voted three times for Theresa May\u2019s deal. The veteran Tory Eurosceptic Bill Cash has confirmed he will vote for the deal. He was a doubt for the government. While the debate goes on in parliament ... The Speaker, John Bercow, had placed a five-minute rule on contributions from MPs. He has now reduced it to three minutes. Chris Grayling uses his time to pay tribute to the prime minister and urge people to accept the deal. Grayling also warns the Letwin amendment, if passed, may cause the house to decline to decide on a deal today. The DUP\u2019s Sammy Wilson made a furious contribution in which he also suggested the party\u2019s MPs would back the Letwin amendment. More from the march. Ken Clarke, former Tory chancellor, home secretary and more, says what we have before us is \u201cundoubtedly a bad deal\u201d and worse than that proposed by Theresa May. But now the choice is very real. He says he\u2019s worried that the purpose of the convoluted agreement over Ireland was so the rest of the UK could be taken out of the customs union straight away. The Canada deal took nine years to put in place, says Clarke. But he says all along he has been determined to avoid a no-deal Brexit. We should support this deal. Some pro-Brexit protesters have been ushered away from the People\u2019s Vote march. Labour\u2019s Peter Kyle responds to Theresa May, saying there was a promise not to create a border in the Irish Sea but that is what has happened. He also says the original referendum was ill-defined. If you want to know what the British people think now: \u201cAsk them.\u201d The Lib Dems\u2019 Sam Gyimah (formerly of the Conservatives of course) asks Kyle if he agrees that any deal should be put to a people\u2019s vote. Kyle says he voted for three different versions of Brexit but it\u2019s got to the point that there are so many different versions of Brexit that there is \u201cirreconcilable division\u201d in the house. The public must have a say, he concludes. Theresa May speaks. She tells a slightly stodgy anecdote about Jonny May scoring two tries for England in the rugby. Saying she feels a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, May says: I intend to rebel against all of those who don\u2019t want to vote to deliver Brexit. She says the SNP has a history of rejecting the results of referendums. The former prime minister says if parliament doesn\u2019t back the deal \u201cit is guilty of the most egregious con tricks on the British people\u201d. If you don\u2019t want no deal you have to vote for a deal. Businesses are crying out for certainty. People want certainty in their lives. She concludes by saying if you want the country to move forward, vote for the deal today. More from the People\u2019s Vote march. Gareth Ellner, 37, dressed up as a Brexit unicorn called \u201cSunlit uplands\u201d, said: I like dressing up and I thought we have been promised the unicorn and I thought it\u2019s right for everyone to get a unicorn. Ellner said he\u2019s worried by the events taking place in parliament. I\u2019m concerned that Boris has told enough lies to enough people to get it [the deal] through. He is still holding out hope for a second referendum. We didn\u2019t know what we were voting to. I am ashamedly one of the voters who voted leave because I thought screw David Cameron. I was politically naive but recent events have made me more political active.\u201d One man pointed to Ellner\u2019s costume and asked: \u201cIt\u2019s not a sexual thing?\u201d before taking a photo with him. The former Labour MP Jared O\u2019Mara, who had said he would resign from parliament in September, has been spotted in the house. The SNP leader in Westminster, Ian Blackford, says the deal gives Northern Ireland a competitive advantage over Scotland. He says Northern Ireland is effectively being kept in the customs union, which is what Scotland wanted. This prime minister and his Brexit fan club in No 10 don\u2019t care about Scotland. He says it was \u201cdishonesty and lies\u201d by Vote Leave that brought this country to vote for Brexit. This is the beginning and end of their precious union. Whether the deal is passed or not today, an extension is needed and there should be an election to get rid of this \u201crotten government\u201d, says Blackford. Former cabinet minister Justine Greening, who had the Tory whip withdrawn, says the house is being given an \u201cimpossible choice\u201d. She likens it to buying a house without going inside. Greening \u2013 along with fellow Tory exiles Dominic Grieve and Guto Bebb \u2013 has previously made clear she wants a second referendum. My colleague Mattha Busby is at the People\u2019s Vote march. Here is Oliver Letwin. He says the purpose of his amendment is to prevent Britain crashing out with no deal if legislation is not passed by 31 October. He says he will vote for implementation of the deal. Despite my support for the PM\u2019s deal I do not believe its responsible to make that threat [of my deal or no deal]. His amendment will only be used to prevent a no-deal Brexit, he says. There\u2019s a lot of love for the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, on Twitter. Starmer says we could end up on WTO terms at the end of 2020 under this deal. This is a trapdoor to no deal. He reminds the house that \u201cnot a single trade union supports this deal\u201d. Labour MP Rushanara Ali says: This is a Trojan deal for no deal Brexit. Starmer agrees. Labour MP Helen Hayes said there should be another vote to give a voice to the hundreds of thousands of young people marching for a people\u2019s vote today. The mayor of London has joined the marchers. Starmer said Johnson\u2019s argument that he is not putting a border in the Irish Sea is simply wrong. On the reasons why the government wants to leave, Starmer says: It\u2019s obvious where the government is going. They want a licence to diverge. Once you move out of alignment you don\u2019t go back. You break the economic model we\u2019ve been operating for decades. Once you do that you look across to the US \u2026 and that\u2019s a different economic model, a deregulated model. He says 10 days is standard holiday in the US and corporate bodies have much more power than workers. The Lib Dem MP Norman Lamb says he has agonised this week over whether to support the deal. He says we run the risk of \u201cinflaming unionist opinion\u201d. Lamb, the only Lib Dem who potentially might have supported the deal, released a video earlier today saying he would not support it. Meanwhile, outside parliament, the people\u2019s vote march has begun. Addressing the crowd at the start, Young Greens co-chair Rosie Rawle said: We have never seen our future snatched away like we are at the present moment. We\u2019re inheriting a country ravaged by austerity and privatisation \u2026 We\u2019re being dragged out of Europe against our will \u2026 And we\u2019re forced to watch our planet spiral towards climate breakdown. But today, every single one of us are here to say \u2019We are not going to let this happen\u2019. While bullies like Boris Johnson and layabouts like Jacob Rees-Mogg drive our future off a cliff, there are millions of young people getting politicised, organised and mobilised. The shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, pleads: Don\u2019t take us out of the customs union. He says that is just what this deal does, it \u201crips up\u201d our close trading relationship with the EU and will result in job losses. If the aspiration of the government is to have a trading relationship \u201cas close as possible\u201d to the existing one, why were those words taken out, asks Starmer. Ed Vaizey, another one of the Tory MPs to have the whip withdrawn over attempts to block a no-deal Brexit, asked if the Letwin amendment did not pass and the deal was voted for but the bill did not pass by 31 October, whether that would lead to no deal? Barclay did not give a straight answer. The former attorney general, Dominic Grieve, another who had the whip, removed said the Letwin amendment was nothing more than \u201can insurance policy\u201d. Barclay said the purpose of the amendment was just delay, \u201cto stop us getting Brexit done\u201d. He says today is an opportunity for all those who want to avoid no deal. The shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, is unhappy about the channelling of the memory of Mo Mowlam by Stephen Barclay. The Tory MP Mark Francois says no member of the ERG spoke against the deal at its meeting this morning. If the deal is passed this morning we will faithfully vote the bill through to the end so that we leave the EU, says Francois, attempting to quash the suggestion that MPs might vote for the deal before trying to force through a no deal at a later date. The Lib Dem MP Luciana Berger again asks how MPs can vote without any economic analysis. To laughter, Barclay says no level of analysis would change her mind. He adds that the deal was only done on Thursday and says analysis would be contingent on what\u2019s happening in the rest of the world. Labour\u2019s Caroline Flint describes the Letwin amendment as \u201ca panic measure\u201d. She says it also underlines that the sponsors of the Benn act had only the intention to delay Brexit and stop it. Pretty clear that she intends to vote for the deal. Gareth Snell is one of the Labour MPs the government is hoping will vote for the deal. Significant backing for the deal: Steve Barclay, the Brexit secretary, says: We will set regulation that is world-leading. He says the UK parliament went ahead of the EU in several areas including maternity rights and will continue to do. Alistair Burt, one of 21 Conservatives who had the whip removed for backing legislation to stop a no-deal Brexit, says he will not support the Letwin amendment. The debate on motions is beginning now. Stephen Barclay is met by cries of \u201cHow dare you?\u201d after he invokes the name of the late Northern Ireland secretary Mo Mowlam. The speaker intervenes, urging MPs to calm down. Barclay continues, saying he was referring to her ability to unify. Barclay says he respects the intentions of Oliver Letwin. But his amendment would render today\u2019s vote meaningless.\u2026 The public would be appalled by pointless further delay. He asks Letwin to withdraw it. Johnson says it cannot be right to delay beyond 31 October so it is his deal or no deal. In response to a question about how he would appeal to remainers, he repeats that it is an opportunity for people who love Europe to move forward. This is what BBC Newsnight\u2019s political editor is saying about the impact of the Letwin amendment. The former Labour MP, Frank Field, says only one vote should be necessary today. The PM says it would be a good thing if the house had what was promised, a meaningful vote tonight. My fear is that the vote we have will not be meaningful. And Sky News says: The Conservative MP Nigel Evans asks the prime minister what message he would have for MPs representing leave constituencies. I think you can guess the answer .... The Tory MP Jeremy Wright says it is incumbent on all MPs to settle the debate and accept a \u201cgood deal\u201d rather than delay in expectation of a \u201cperfect deal\u201d. Johnson says it is as perfect a deal as you can get in the circumstances, while accepting \u201cthere are difficulties with it\u201d. Let\u2019s knock it through if we possibly can tonight. Labour\u2019s Pat McFadden says PM is promising Tory MPs the deregulated future they dream off while promising opposition MPs a road to better workers\u2019 rights, interests Johnson rubbished while a journalist. Both cannot be true, he insists. Johnson says both are possible. The Lib Dem MP Luciana Berger asks how MPs can vote on a deal today when the PM\u2019s Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, was on TV this morning saying no economic assessment of the deal had been done. Johnson responds by saying the deal has been welcomed by a broad range of people, including the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney. The Tory MP John Baron stands up and says he will back the deal because it abolishes the \u201canti-democratic backstop\u201d. The abolition also makes a free trade deal more likely, says Baron. Johnson - unsurprisingly - agrees. Another former Tory, David Gauke, says Johnson has done well to agree a deal but asks whether he will ensure that a \u201cdeep and special relationship\u201d is agreed with the EU before the implementation period comes to an end. The PM says the 14-month period to reach a free trade deal with the EU is sufficient even though it is \u201ca blistering pace\u201d. He says detractors said he would never be able to reopen the withdrawal deal or get rid of the backstop (some would suggest he has not achieved the latter). The Green party\u2019s Caroline Lucas says the deal takes a \u201cwrecking ball\u201d to our social and environmental standards and that is why the PM will not put it to the British people. Johnson says she has misread the deal, as parliament makes a commitment to uphold standards. He says he hopes standards will be even higher. Justine Greening, another former Tory, asks if the PM recognises that dismissing concerns of other nations within the UK and communities within England is no way to bring Britain back together. Johnson says he didn\u2019t mean to dismiss anyone\u2019s concerns. His strong belief is the way to move the country forward is to get the deal done. He even insists getting Brexit done will give people the opportunity to stress their pro-European views. Greg Clark, another former Tory who had the whip removed, asks if Johnson will give a commitment that workers\u2019 rights in the UK will never be inferior to those in the EU. The PM says: \u201cYes, I can.\u201d There is a lot of noise in response including someone shouting \u201cYeah, yeah, yeah\u201d. Unclear whether it is a hearty endorsement of Johnson or sarcastic ... Liz Saville Roberts, Plaid Cymru\u2019s Westminster leader, says the Welsh are an \u201cafterthought\u201d and he has refused to share impact assessments. She denounces the \u201cbillionaire\u2019s Brexit\u201d. The PM responds by saying Wales voted to leave and she should respect that. This was Philip Hammond, one of 21 MPs who lost the Tory whip, for backing legislation to stop a no-deal Brexit. Labour\u2019s Angela Eagle says Johnson has put a border down the Irish Sea after promising he would not do so. Why would anyone believe him again? Johnson says she is \u201csimply wrong\u201d. We have delivered in defiance of the scepticism of the party opposite who said it was necessary to keep Northern Ireland in the customs union, says the PM. The Labour MP, Hilary Benn, says the deal will ensure friction-free trade for Northern Ireland. Why is the PM so determined to deny that to the rest of the UK? Johnson says Benn believes in a delay to Brexit, which the PM does not agree with. There are reasons for treating the NI border with sensItivity and respect, says the PM. David Davis says the prime minister has achieved what was deemed \u201cimpossible\u201d two weeks ago. The DUP\u2019s Westminster leader, Nigel Dodds, takes a different view. He says the deal is contrary to the deal made in 2017 that said regulatory difference could only be implemented with the agreement of the Northern Ireland assembly. The PM says the arrangements with respect to Northern Ireland that have made the deal possible are temporary. He also criticises the idea that anyone should have a veto when the overall Brexit vote was won by 52% to 48%. He also insists the deal upholds the Good Friday agreement. The PM says it will not remove workers\u2019 rights and accuses Swinson of not allowing the British public a say on the deal by preventing a general election. He also mocks what he says is the Lib Dems\u2019 lack of influence in Brussels. The Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson, stands up and begins by saying the deal removes protections on workers\u2019 rights. The speaker, John Bercow, intervenes as she is jeered admonishing MPs for shouting her down. She blasts the PM for not giving the British public a choice on his deal. Iain Duncan Smith rises and says he will back the deal. He calls on Oliver Letwin to remove his amendment, in order to give the people \u201ca meaningful vote\u201d. The PM responds by saying it would be a great shame if the opportunity to have a meaningful vote \u201cwere to be taken away from us\u201d. He stresses that he thinks Letwin is motivated by the best of intentions. Bizarrely, the PM begins his response to the SNP\u2019s Westminster leader by congratulating the England rugby team on their World Cup quarter-final victory over Australia. It\u2019s a great deal for all four home nations, says Johnson. The Scots will enjoy the benefit of their \u201cspectacular marine wealth\u201d, says the PM. Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, says the PM and his cronies don\u2019t care about Scotland. This Tory government has sold Scotland out. He says special arrangements have been made for Northern Ireland but not for Scotland, despite a majority of Scots voting to remain in the EU. The Scottish parliament and people have been treated with contempt, says Blackford. Any and all assessments of any Brexit outcome show that Scotland and the whole of the UK will be poorer as a result of leaving the EU, he says. The Old Etonian prime minister gets some jeers, responding to Clarke, as he refers to the European \u201celite\u201d. He, unsurprisingly paints an optimistic view of trade post-Brexit under his deal. Norman Lamb, the only potential Lib Dem to vote for the deal, will not do so, he has said. It is Ken Clarke now. He asks the PM if he would accept that for the last 50 years and all four PMs whose governments Clarke served in believed EU membership enhanced Britain\u2019s place in the world and strengthened its economy. Like a schoolteacher admonishing a pupil, Johnson says he is \u201cdisappointed by the tone\u201d of Corbyn\u2019s response. Brexit gives us the opportunity to do things we have not had the opportunity to do and people want us to do, including protecting the environment and animals, says Johnson. He quotes the Conservative peer Stuart Rose, who was chair of Britain Stronger in Europe, but said the deal would be good for the economy. Corbyn does not trust his own party, says Johnson, immediately after saying it is not the time for adversarial politics. He concludes by saying the deal will take the whole of Europe forward. It is \u201cnonsense\u201d to say this is the only way of blocking no deal, says Corbyn. It would lead to a race to the bottom in regulations, insists the Labour leader. He wants the PM to confirm that if a free trade agreement is not done, the UK will revert to trade under World Trade Organization rules. Concluding, Corbyn dubs it a \u201csell-out\u201d deal. Moving on to workers\u2019 rights, Corbyn warns \u201cwe cannot give the government a blank cheque\u201d. It would hammer the economy, cost jobs and sell workers down the river, says the Labour leader, quoting Frances O\u2019Grady, the general secretary of the TUC. He was jeered as he mentioned her name. Corbyn responded by saying she represented 6 million voters. Corbyn says he understands the fatigue and frustration in the house but we simply cannot vote for a deal worse than that which was voted down three times. Corbyn says the PM is not being honest about the effect of this deal on manufacturing and jobs. He says a vote for the deal would be a vote to cut jobs all over the country and usher in a \u201cTrump trade deal \u2026 exposing our families to chlorinated chicken\u201d. Johnson says his deal is \u201ca great prospect and a great deal\u201d and urges MPs to vote for it. Now it\u2019s Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s turn. He begins by thanking parliamentary staff who have come in on their day off to facilitate this session. But he says Johnson has negotiated a deal that is even worse than the original withdrawal agreement: These benches will not be duped. There is \u201cvery little appetite\u201d among EU27 leaders for any further delay, Johnson says, even of \u201cone single day\u201d. He urges MPs to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d. He says even if he is compelled under the Benn Act to write a letter requesting an extension, he will never believe that delay is a good idea. It\u2019s time to get this thing done, he says, \u201cto end this debilitating feud\u201d. \u201cOur National Health Service will not be on the table\u201d in future trade talks, Johnson tells MPs. (The threat of a Trump-led US grab on NHS contracts is a concern for many.) The Speaker, John Bercow, has announced that MPs will vote on Oliver Letwin and Hilary Benn\u2019s amendment, in which the House of Commons would withhold support from Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal until the relevant legislation has been passed. If it passes, it would force the prime minister to request an extension to Brexit by 11pm tonight, the deadline set in the Benn act. Some MPs see it as extra insurance against a no-deal Brexit, in case MPs supported Johnson\u2019s deal today \u2013 fulfilling the requirements of the Benn act \u2013 and then voted against the withdrawal bill. Without an extension in place, they feared the government could still take Britain out of the EU without a deal on 31 October. Other backers of the Letwin amendment would like to support Johnson\u2019s deal, but regard it as securing extra time to scrutinise it, and perhaps secure amendments. Government sources are suggesting this morning that if Letwin passes \u2013 as appears highly likely \u2013 the whips will simply order Conservative MPs to go home, effectively boycotting the vote on the motion as amended. They are not making clear whether they will request an article 50 extension. Johnson moves on to concerns around workers\u2019 rights and protections. No one believes in lowering standards, he says, to loud heckles from opposing benches. Animal welfare standards could be higher post-Brexit, he says. Johnson now sets out the details of his new deal, struck with the EU this week. For those wondering how much it differs from Theresa May\u2019s deal, here\u2019s a handy visual guide: And here\u2019s a point-by-point breakdown of the key changes: Johnson says his deal allows the UK \u201cwhole and entire\u201d to leave the EU, but preserves the ties of friendship and cooperation. He praises the EU for its flexibility in reopening the withdrawal agreement. And he says he will listen to all MPs speaking in the Commons today. Johnson says the UK has over the years been a \u201cbackmarker\u201d in the EU, opting out of schemes such as the euro. He says we have been \u201chalfhearted Europeans\u201d, but adds that this means \u201cpart of our hearts\u201d are with Europe. It is our continent. It is precisely because we are capable of thinking both things at once \u2026 that the whole experience of the last three and a half years has been so difficult for this country and so divisive. Johnson says his deal \u201ccan heal the rift in British politics\u201d: Now is the time for this great House of Commons to come together and bring the country together today. Bercow says he has selected the Letwin amendment for debate, and also Kyle-Wilson amendment to the second motion. And now Boris Johnson is on his feet to present his deal to the Commons. Speaker John Bercow is welcoming MPs to this extraordinary Saturday session. And here\u2019s confirmation that the hardline Brexiters of the ERG have broken from the DUP \u2013 Steve Baker and Mark Francois say they and their colleagues will vote for Boris Johnson\u2019s deal: Tory MP Bernard Jenkin seems to be confirming that the ERG will vote for the deal, albeit not wholeheartedly: The Sunday Times\u2019 political editor, Tim Shipman, quotes an unnamed \u201cNo 10 source\u201d saying the government will abandon the vote on the deal if the Letwin amendment \u2013 which would allow parliament to withhold its approval until the legislation to implement Brexit has passed \u2013 goes through today. The BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg says that if that happens, MPs will be asked to vote on the deal on Monday instead: Rebecca Long Bailey, Labour\u2019s shadow business secretary, described Boris Johnson\u2019s deal as a \u201csellout\u201d. She told the BBC: It\u2019s actually far worse than Theresa May\u2019s deal, which was voted down repeatedly in the House of Commons. It\u2019s a sellout, it sells out industry, it sells out our rights and protection, and it potentially sells off our NHS in future trade deals to Donald Trump \u2013 and that\u2019s not something we can condone.\u201d She called on the government to provide stronger commitments on workers\u2019 rights: The protections that have been offered are simply, as I understand it \u2026 pretty similar to what Theresa May\u2019s proposed, with the ability for parliament to review any changes in EU law when it comes to workers\u2019 rights and environmental protections then vote on them that is \u2026 dependent on a Tory majority, who at the best of times would vote against any improvements in workers\u2019 rights. What we want to see is a legal lock \u2026 so we don\u2019t fall behind improvements in workers\u2019 rights and environmental standards, so if the government was serious about that then they would make more robust legal protections.\u201d While Long Bailey wouldn\u2019t comment on Labour\u2019s whipping arrangement for the Letwin amendment, she did say: We don\u2019t trust Boris Johnson at all and we need to protect as much as we possibly can, so I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we were supportive of this amendment.\u201d MPs present and past have been out and about on the airwaves this morning setting out their positions. Former chancellor Philip Hammond \u2013 ejected by Boris Johnson after he voted for the Benn act \u2013 told the BBC he would vote for the Letwin amendment: This cannot be the final vote today because we do not know the full shape of the package. The Letwin amendment gives us an insurance policy that prevents us having to look at this bill against the constant threat of the government to pull the plug and crash us out on 31 October. We have to remove any risk of leaving on 31 October 31 with no deal.\u201d Tony Blair told BB Radio 4\u2019s Today programme MPs should defeat the deal: If this deal had been put before the British parliament a year ago, or two years ago, there is absolutely no way it would pass. The only reason the government can try and get it passed now is frankly \u2026 people are completely fed up with Brexit. They want it over. They want it done with.\u201d But the culture secretary, Nicky Morgan, tweeted that MPs should get onboard with the plan: Sky News reports that Steve Baker, who chairs the hardline Brexiter ERG, has said the group will back the deal today: With the DUP definitely against the deal, and a number of the former Conservative MPs who lost the whip last month seemingly onboard, two groups will be vital. First are the so-called \u201cSpartans\u201d, the most hardline of Tory Brexiters. Some of these have already come onboard, and others could follow \u2013 but with the DUP opposed, this is still a finely balanced decision. The other group set to be endlessly pestered by Johnson\u2019s team are Labour MPs from leave-voting areas who support a deal, such as Caroline Flint, Stephen Kinnock and others. They face intense Labour pressure to vote against it, but could still potentially be persuaded the vote the other way. These MPs might be more likely to back the deal if it is amended via the Letwin-Benn plan. Key players Steve Baker: the Tory hard Brexiters\u2019 club, the European Research Group (ERG), is meeting first thing on Saturday. Whichever way Baker, its chair, chooses to vote will be a key indicator for the choice of other Spartans. Philip Hammond: on the other side of the Tory divide, the former chancellor is prominent among the sizeable group of rebel MPs who lost the whip last month, and could go either way. Caroline Flint: co-leader of the \u201cMPs for a deal\u201d grouping, Flint is a leading member of the Labour contingent that believes the UK should leave sooner rather than later. If she backs Johnson\u2019s deal, she could take others with her. Norman Lamb: while the rest of the Liberal Democrats are firmly against the deal, Lamb \u2013 who will step down at the next election \u2013 has long been much more Brexit-minded than his colleagues. He is believed to still be deciding, and while it will only be one vote, this could be crucial. Welcome to our live coverage of the vote on Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal. The decision MPs make today could determine whether the UK leaves the EU, as Johnson has promised, on 31 October, or instead faces the prospect of requesting an extension from the European Union \u2013 and a possible general election. Peter Walker has written a guide to see you through the day. Here are the key moments: The Commons convenes at 9.30am with a statement from Boris Johnson on the Brexit deal he has negotiated with the EU, followed by questions. The actual motion on the deal follows afterwards, to be opened by another minister. It is only when this debate begins that we will know which amendments have been selected for a vote by the Speaker, John Bercow. The number of amendments will affect the length of the process, so the key vote could come any time from mid-afternoon to early evening. Also on the order paper is the European Union (Withdrawal) (No 2) Act \u2013 better known as the Benn act. This is the backbench-created law that would compel Johnson to seek a Brexit extension if his deal is not passed. The Lords is also sitting to consider the same two issues.",

Football, real sodding football, is actually back. </strong>After the joyless rigmarole of the international break we can get back to Premier League business, VAR chat and minor breakdowns over the Match of the Day running order.</p> <p>For Tottenham there can be no more a heartening sight than the Watford team bus coming down the M1. Given the mood around White Hart Lane currently, you could be forgiven for thinking it is Spurs who are rock bottom of the Premier League and already on to their second manager of the season. Instead, a win for Mauricio Pochettino, a few kind results elsewhere and all of a sudden the picture looks a little prettier.</p> <p>One of those results those in North London will be hoping for will be at Chelsea, where Newcastle arrive at Stamford Bridge on the back of a win over Manchester United. That used to mean a lot more but Steve Bruce and his team will have confidence that they are capable of causing their hosts some problems.</p> <p>Away from the marquee fixtures, there is a healthy slate of Premier League action. Leicester host Burnley in a battle of two sides hoping to gatecrash the top four and with markedly different approaches to doing so. Leicester, the aesthetes, are all silky touches and waif-like midfielders and Burnley, a bowling ball of razors dressed in claret. </p> <p>Elsewhere, Graham Potter\u2019s pass-happy Seagulls head to Aston Villa hoping their win over Spurs was more than a flash in the pan; Wolves host Southampton with an eye on the top half of the table; and mid-table Bournemouth welcome a Norwich side capable of giving anyone a game whilst leaking goals at a prodigious rate. </p> <p>Up next, team news!</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-19T12:46:21.763Z\">at 1.46pm BST</time></p>  </div>",

Here is Jacob Steinberg\u2019s from Stamford Bridge: Bradford 2-1 Crawley Cambridge 4-0 Exeter Colchester 0-1 Morecambe Crewe 3-1 Swindon Forest Green 2-2 Mansfield Grimsby 0-4 Leyton Orient Newport 2-1 Scunthorpe Northampton 2-0 Salford Oldham 0-1 Macclesfield Plymouth 2-0 Carlisle Port Vale 1-1 Stevenage Walsall 1-2 Cheltenham Wimbledon 1-0 Portsmouth Bolton 1-3 Rochdale Doncaster 2-0 Bristol Rovers Fleetwood 4-1 Burton Gillingham 1-2 Peterborough MK Dons 0-0 Coventry Rotherham 1-2 Oxford Wycombe 1-0 Sunderland Barnsley 1-1 Swansea Brentford 3-2 Millwall Charlton 3-0 Derby Hull 2-3 QPR Leeds 1-0 Birmingham Luton 3-0 Bristol City Middlesbrough 0-1 West Brom Reading 1-0 Preston Stoke 2-0 Fulham Aston Villa 2-1 Brighton Bournemouth 0-0 Norwich Chelsea 1-0 Newcastle Leicester 2-1 Burnley Tottenham 1-1 Watford Wolves 1-1 Southampton Ten-man Brighton denied at the last by Matt Targett. Alli earns a late point for Spurs as VAR causes more controversy. Grealish tees up Targett and the full back steals it at the death with a left-foot shot past Mat Ryan. This sums it up: A ruckus at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, yellow cards are being flashed, handbags everywhere and Spurs have a free-kick. It is farcical stuff. Alonso\u2019s goal enough at the Bridge. This is bizarre, Alli thinks he has scored. Foster makes an error and Alli capitalises as it ricochets off his shoulder (or is that his arm?) VAR checks it, the referee awards the goal but the screen says no goal. This is absurd. Watford kick off and the goal stands but that could have easily been ruled out. I want to put my head through the desk. Watford know they are close now. All the time killing techniques are coming out, substitutions, cramp and delayed restarts. More VAR, this time the video assistant denies Danny Rose a penalty. You have seen those given... Burnley think they have levelled but VAR rules it out. A bit of a scramble as Wood thinks he has scored but VAR judges that he fouled Jonny Evans. This one will be poured over post-match. Sissoko goes into the book for tripping Deulofeu on the edge of the box. The Frenchman was put in an uncomfortable position as Gazzaniga\u2019s poor clearance went straight to a Watford player. Alli inches away from an equaliser as he cannot get on to cross as he slides to make contact. Spurs pressing but Watford holding firm. Youri Tielemans smashes his finish into the roof of the net to put the Foxes in front for the first time. Hudson-Odoi is instrumental in this, sliding a composed pass into the path of Alonso after Pulisic broke into the box. Watford still looking dangerous on the break and again Janmaat wastes an opportunity, this time turning down a chance to shoot on his left, cutting back to stall the move. At the Bridge, Andy Carroll is on for Joelinton. Brighton have settled since the break and had a number of chances on the break. Montoya wastes the most recent and best after being teed up by Gross. Chelsea see a couple of chances go begging, Abraham and Pulisic going close in quick succession with Dubravka to the fore. At the Vitality Stadium, Ramsdale has made an outstanding save to deny Pukki with a strike that looked destined for the bottom corner. He finally gets his goal but the decision to award the spot kick looked very soft. After having a goal ruled out by VAR earlier, Jimenez will not care a jot. Can they convert? Still 0-0 at the Bridge and Chelsea\u2019s afternoon is summed up by Willian letting a routine pass slip under his foot and go out of play. Pulisic is coming on. Janmaat wastes a glorious opportunity as Spurs get caught short at the back, Watford have a three-on-two in the box but the Dutchman fluffs his shot. Spurs pushing but leaving big gaps at the back. Capitalising on a Wolves mistake, Ings picks up the ball and moves into the box before finishing smartly past Rui Patricio. Brighton are hanging on. Mat Ryan has to make a reflex save to deny Hourihane a second, blocking the effort with his chest. Just before March fired just wide when well placed to shoot at the other end. A chance at either end at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. Son nearly makes an instant impact, fleeting away down the right before driving into the box and powering a shot against the crossbar. Then Deulofeu counters at pace and gets in behind the Spurs backline before squaring it for Pereyra but his effort is deflected behind for a corner. Chance for Vardy at the King Power but Lowton makes a vital interception to deny the striker tapping home second. Saint-Maximin is a fun player and unmissable with his blonde locks. He starts the second half with a powerful dart deep into the Chelsea half. He tries to feed Joelinton and the move breaks down. We are back underway in the 3 o\u2019clock kick-offs. Son is coming on for Sanchez at Spurs. Brighton are also making a change, with Solly March coming on for Connolly. Nate Elliot emails in with a fair point: It\u2019s fashionable to criticise clubs\u2019 contortions to advertise alternate kits, and many clubs have much to answer for here. But surely you can appreciate there\u2019s not a lot of contrast between yellow and white? Watford choosing a strip that clearly contrasts with their hosts\u2019 will be appreciated by millions of people with vision impairment, including the nearly one-in-ten men who have some form of colour blindness. Bradford 1-0 Crawley Cambridge 1-0 Exeter Colchester 0-0 Morecambe Crewe 0-1 Swindon Forest Green 1-0 Mansfield Grimsby 0-2 Leyton Orient Newport 1-0 Scunthorpe Northampton 1-0 Salford Oldham 0-0 Macclesfield Plymouth 1-0 Carlisle Port Vale 1-1 Stevenage Walsall 0-1 Cheltenham Wimbledon 0-0 Portsmouth Bolton 0-0 Rochdale Doncaster 1-0 Bristol Rovers Fleetwood 1-1 Burton Gillingham 0-1 Peterborough MK Dons 0-0 Coventry Rotherham 1-1 Oxford Wycombe 1-0 Sunderland Barnsley 0-0 Swansea Brentford 0-1 Millwall Charlton 1-0 Derby Hull 1-1 QPR Leeds 0-0 Birmingham Luton 0-0 Bristol City Middlesbrough 0-0 West Brom Reading 0-0 Preston Stoke 1-0 Fulham Premier League Aston Villa 1-1 Brighton Bournemouth 0-0 Norwich Chelsea 0-0 Newcastle Leicester 1-1 Burnley Tottenham 0-1 Watford Wolves 0-0 Southampton This time Villa are level, Jack Grealish gets on the end of an El Ghazi cross and Brighton cannot hang on until the break. This one counts as Vardy gets up to head home just before the break. Here comes VAR. Wolves think Jiminez has put them ahead but there is a marginal offside that one is struck off and then Conor Hourihane\u2019s apparent equaliser at Villa Park bites the dust, a foul in the build-up it seems. Big moment for Tottenham and they are lucky to survive. Deulofeu goes down in the box wanting a penalty after a tangle with Vertonghen. VAR says no. They have the lead and have been looking good for it but now Brighton could be facing an uphill battle with key man Mooy dismissed. After picking up a booking for blocking a quick free-kick, the Australian brings down Jack Grealish and earns a deserved early bath. Ruben Neves in a spot of bother? The Wolves midfielder has come second best in a challenge with Danny Ings. He is hobbling on for now. Aaron Connelly and Neal Maupay are linking up well at Villa Park, the Irishman is slipped in by his strike partner and forces Tom Heaton into a good save with this feet. A classic little and little combo. Tottenham have settled into a familiar pattern for this season. Their play is slow and laboured, probing from side to side but not really making any inroads. Watford look happy to hold the home side on the edge of the box. Willian is looking threatening at the Bridge, he has been mesmerising the Newcastle defence with the ball at his feet and goes close to breaking the deadlock with an effort that rustles the side netting. Leicester have a couple of chances and have been control against Burnley but the visitors are nothing if not resilient. They swiftly head up the other end where Chris Wood stuns the home fans by heading in McNeil\u2019s cross. Alan Davis emails in from Gorran in Cornwall: Why are Watford (first choice colours yellow and black) playing in second choice colours (navy blue and white) at Spurs (in navy blue and white)? Isn\u2019t it time for action on this annoying and cynical phenomenon? I could give you the boring answer that clubs have minimum matches for wearing their away kit written into the contracts but no one cares about that. Ban this nonsense. Adam Webster has given the away side the lead, powerfully heading in at the back post from a Pascal Gross free-kick for his first goal since joining the club in the summer. Couple of chances for Chelsea as Hudson-Odoi clips a ball to the far post and Tammy Abraham heads wide, then Mason Mount has a strike at goal but Dubravka saves well. Danny Rose wants a penalty as he goes down under challenge from Pereyra but the refs shakes his head and you imagine the VAR is doing so to. Watford still carrying a threat at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, they win a free-kick on the edge of the Spurs box but Deulofeu clips the top of the wall with his effort. In Spain, Barcelona have wrapped up a routine win at Eibar: A bit of life at Spurs. Sissoko gets in a nice position to shoot but his effort is typically wayward. Newcastle are looking good at the Bridge. They have had the better of the early exchanges and look dangerous going forward with Saint-Maximin and Joelinton. The former just flashed a half chance past the post. Wow, minutes after losing Welbeck and the Hornets are ahead. It was a well-made goal with the ball spread wide to Daryl Janmaat on the right, the Dutchman sweeps in an inch-perfect low cross for the on-rushing Abdoulaye Doucour\u00e9 to tap home. Welbeck goes off and is replaced by Gerard Deulofeu. Not the start Watford would have wanted. Oh dear, oh dear. Watford have a man down and it is Danny Welbeck, you feel for the striker. Injury plagued does not do his fitness record justice, and the England international is coming off after less than four minutes. Right then, we are off in the Premier League. At the King Power Stadium, James Maddison has found his way from the casino the centre of Leicester\u2019s midfield. Burnley bring in Jay Rodriguez and Robbie Brady from the start. At Villa Park, Dean Smith has stuck to the same side who battered Norwich before the international break. For Brighton, Leandro Trossard is back in the squad and on the bench. Davy Pr\u00f6pper comes in for Steven Alzate in the only change to the Seagull\u2019s starting XI. Chelsea\u2019s large English contingent in the starting XI is in part because N\u2019Golo Kante was injured on international duty with France. Ross Barkley starts in place of Kante in Chelsea\u2019s only change from the 4-1 win over Southampton. Times are changing at the Bridge: So Spurs make seven changes from the 3-0 away loss at Brighton. Harry Kane, Toby Alderweireld, Jan Vertonghen and Moussa Sissoko are the players to retain their spots in the starting XI. Dele Alli and Lucas Moura both in from the start.

Football, real sodding football, is actually back. After the joyless rigmarole of the international break we can get back to Premier League business, VAR chat and minor breakdowns over the Match of the Day running order. For Tottenham there can be no more a heartening sight than the Watford team bus coming down the M1. Given the mood around White Hart Lane currently, you could be forgiven for thinking it is Spurs who are rock bottom of the Premier League and already on to their second manager of the season. Instead, a win for Mauricio Pochettino, a few kind results elsewhere and all of a sudden the picture looks a little prettier. One of those results those in North London will be hoping for will be at Chelsea, where Newcastle arrive at Stamford Bridge on the back of a win over Manchester United. That used to mean a lot more but Steve Bruce and his team will have confidence that they are capable of causing their hosts some problems. Away from the marquee fixtures, there is a healthy slate of Premier League action. Leicester host Burnley in a battle of two sides hoping to gatecrash the top four and with markedly different approaches to doing so. Leicester, the aesthetes, are all silky touches and waif-like midfielders and Burnley, a bowling ball of razors dressed in claret. Elsewhere, Graham Potter\u2019s pass-happy Seagulls head to Aston Villa hoping their win over Spurs was more than a flash in the pan; Wolves host Southampton with an eye on the top half of the table; and mid-table Bournemouth welcome a Norwich side capable of giving anyone a game whilst leaking goals at a prodigious rate. Up next, team news!",

      "body": "<p>Seldom can a manager have greeted a last-gasp winning goal for his team so angrily. After Matt Targett struck in the fourth minute of stoppage time for Aston Villa, Dean Smith had an expression like thunder. He was still dismayed, he explained, by two things: his team\u2019s all-round performance and what he considered to be the most outrageous intervention yet by VAR against Aston Villa, who had a goal contentiously disallowed for the third time this season.</p> <p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t even celebrate at the end,\u201d said Smith. Nearly everyone else supporting Villa went wild, as Targett\u2019s first goal for the club secured three points from a match in which Brighton had been dominant until Aaron Mooy got himself sent off in the 35th minute. The visitors had been leading thanks to Adam Webster, and although the excellent Jack Grealish equalised before the break, Brighton looked good value for a point until Grealish set up Targett for the decisive breakthrough. \u201cWe probably didn\u2019t deserve to win,\u201d said Smith.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/19/leicester-city-burnley-premier-league-match-report\">Tielemans gives Leicester win but Burnley denied equaliser by VAR</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Brighton are a team transformed under Graham Potter, nothing like the side who trudged to Premier League survival under Chris Hughton last term. For the first half hour here they attacked with such fluency they made Villa look like dunces at a Mensa meeting. Less than a minute had elapsed when Neal Maupay fired off the visitors first shot, which whizzed just wide.</p> <p>Although it was not one-way traffic, Brighton\u2019s superiority made one wonder how they had not scored in their previous three road trips. They soon put that right here, although, given their impressive movement, it felt wrong that their breakthrough came from a set piece. Pascal Gross curled over a free-kick from the left with a precision that Villa\u2019s markers lacked, and Webster was free to guide a downward header into the far corner.</p> <p>Maupay, who continually found space between midfield and attack, forced Tom Heaton into a save in the 32nd minute and then, moments later, threaded a pass through to Aaron Connolly, who would have made the score 2-0 if not for Heaton\u2019s rapid reaction.</p> <p>It took uncharacteristic clumsiness from Mooy to turn things in Villa\u2019s favour. The midfielder was already on a yellow card when he committed himself unwisely to a tackle on Grealish, knee-sliding into his opponent\u2019s ankle in the 32nd minute. Fresh optimism swept through Villa Park when he was ordered off.</p> <p>A mighty roar went up in the 42nd minute when Conor Hourihane rammed the ball into the net from 16 yards but the goal was wiped off following a review by VAR, Wesley having been judged to have fouled the goalkeeper in the buildup. It was true that Wesley\u2019s elbow caught Matthew Ryan as the pair jumped for the ball but contact does not necessarily equate to a foul and Smith was adamant there had been no clear and obvious reason to reverse the on-field decision. It was the third time this season that Villa have had disallowed a goal ruled out after a review by VAR but Smith found this decision even more difficult to accept than the ones against Burnley and Crystal Palace. \u201cFor the first time, I believe, VAR has got involved in a subjective decision,\u201d said Smith. \u201cI must have missed the memo where they said that\u2019s what it is for.\u201d Good thing, then, that Grealish struck a legitimate equaliser moments later. Struck is a generous word, as the midfielder did not meet Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Guilbert\u2019s low cross cleanly. But he was in the right place at the time to bundle the ball into the net from close range, finishing a move he had started.</p> <p>Being cut to 10 men and pegged back on the scoreboard barely dulled Brighton\u2019s ambition. They continued to attack when they could in the second half and defended defiantly when they had to. They were on course for a point until Grealish skilfully teed up Targett for an emphatic finish.</p>",

Nearly everyone else supporting Villa went wild, as Targett\u2019s first goal for the club secured three points from a match in which Brighton had been dominant until Aaron Mooy got himself sent off in the 35th minute. The visitors had been leading thanks to Adam Webster, and although the excellent Jack Grealish equalised before the break, Brighton looked good value for a point until Grealish set up Targett for the decisive breakthrough. \u201cWe probably didn\u2019t deserve to win,\u201d said Smith. Brighton are a team transformed under Graham Potter, nothing like the side who trudged to Premier League survival under Chris Hughton last term. For the first half hour here they attacked with such fluency they made Villa look like dunces at a Mensa meeting. Less than a minute had elapsed when Neal Maupay fired off the visitors first shot, which whizzed just wide. Although it was not one-way traffic, Brighton\u2019s superiority made one wonder how they had not scored in their previous three road trips. They soon put that right here, although, given their impressive movement, it felt wrong that their breakthrough came from a set piece. Pascal Gross curled over a free-kick from the left with a precision that Villa\u2019s markers lacked, and Webster was free to guide a downward header into the far corner. Maupay, who continually found space between midfield and attack, forced Tom Heaton into a save in the 32nd minute and then, moments later, threaded a pass through to Aaron Connolly, who would have made the score 2-0 if not for Heaton\u2019s rapid reaction. It took uncharacteristic clumsiness from Mooy to turn things in Villa\u2019s favour. The midfielder was already on a yellow card when he committed himself unwisely to a tackle on Grealish, knee-sliding into his opponent\u2019s ankle in the 32nd minute. Fresh optimism swept through Villa Park when he was ordered off. A mighty roar went up in the 42nd minute when Conor Hourihane rammed the ball into the net from 16 yards but the goal was wiped off following a review by VAR, Wesley having been judged to have fouled the goalkeeper in the buildup. It was true that Wesley\u2019s elbow caught Matthew Ryan as the pair jumped for the ball but contact does not necessarily equate to a foul and Smith was adamant there had been no clear and obvious reason to reverse the on-field decision. It was the third time this season that Villa have had disallowed a goal ruled out after a review by VAR but Smith found this decision even more difficult to accept than the ones against Burnley and Crystal Palace. \u201cFor the first time, I believe, VAR has got involved in a subjective decision,\u201d said Smith. \u201cI must have missed the memo where they said that\u2019s what it is for.\u201d Good thing, then, that Grealish struck a legitimate equaliser moments later. Struck is a generous word, as the midfielder did not meet Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Guilbert\u2019s low cross cleanly. But he was in the right place at the time to bundle the ball into the net from close range, finishing a move he had started. Being cut to 10 men and pegged back on the scoreboard barely dulled Brighton\u2019s ambition. They continued to attack when they could in the second half and defended defiantly when they had to. They were on course for a point until Grealish skilfully teed up Targett for an emphatic finish.",

Meanwhile, there\u2019s a generation of the inner-city poor who survive pretty much on take-out Chinese now.</p> <p><strong>Our biggest family meal was Thanksgiving</strong><strong>. </strong>The process always started on a Thursday, when my aunts used to soak the dessert in brandy or sherry for three days. On Friday they\u2019d do the meats and on Saturday the vegetables. I\u2019d snap the beans while watching <em>Soul Train</em>, or National Geographic, with my Uncle Jim. On Sunday it was church. Then, at 4pm, 16 of us could start having the feast. The problem was how obedient me and my cousin were in the run-up to it. How you didn\u2019t fight over licking the leftover cake batter or frosting off grandmother\u2019s spoon and never touched the pies or cobbler. If you were going to sneak a scoop of ice cream from the refrigerator you\u2019d better pray no one saw you.</p> <p><strong>To get the prize</strong> \u2013 the little toy \u2013 in a cereal box at my grandmother\u2019s house, I\u2019d be up and dressed early. She would say: \u201cDon\u2019t ever put your hands in the cereal box.\u201d If she wasn\u2019t looking, you\u2019d put your hands in briefly, but otherwise you\u2019d be thinking strategically \u2013 being third or fourth in line, so that at least by the time half of the cereal box was poured, the toy might be in sight.</p> <p><strong>I was eight years old,</strong> we were staying in an airport Sheraton out west and I liked the band Kiss. I woke up wanting a drink and my sister said: \u201cGo take some money from the dresser and get yourself a soda.\u201d I went down and got a soda and then the lift door opened and inside, in full costume, stood Kiss. I screamed, dropped the soda and ran away.</p> <p><strong>I once asked my mother to buy Peanut Butter Captain Crunch</strong> but she said: \u201cWe won\u2019t get that this week. We\u2019ll get this no-frills cereal.\u201d That week, in church, members of the congregation were giving testimonials, like \u201cI want to say that God is good, because I got a job as a bus driver this week\u201d or \u201cI broke my leg in a car accident but I\u2019m alive\u201d and everyone cheered: \u201cPraise the Lord!\u201d I was 11 years old and I stood up and said: \u201cI just want people to pray for my family. We went shopping but we couldn\u2019t afford everything.\u201d It turned out that they had an emergency church pantry and they gave me a lift home with six free bags of food. My mother was highly embarrassed and returned everything \u2013 except the Jiffy Pop popcorn \u2013 and apologised profusely. That is one time I misinterpreted, \u201cOh God, I can\u2019t have Peanut Butter Captain Crunch\u201d as \u201cWe\u2019re real poor.\u201d</p> <p><strong>It\u2019s weird how nowadays chefs are experimenting</strong> with sweet and salty, because I felt like a pioneer as a child. Whenever I\u2019d make my oatmeal, with honey and butter, I\u2019d also put salt in, to offset. I always believed that salt teaches your tastebuds how sweet your honey is. Salted caramel is now a norm, but I pioneered. Back in those days, people looked at me like I was crazy.</p> <p><strong>I used to go to record stores</strong> in West Philly with my father and there were two food options afterwards \u2013 Sunray drugstore, a bit like your Boots but with a countertop where they\u2019d serve cheeseburgers and fries. The second and my preferred option was a soul food restaurant called Broadway\u2019s which had an awesome jukebox. Back then my choices were often based on how good the jukebox was in a restaurant. And the crucial element for me, when at Philadelphia High School for the Creative and Performing Arts, was that right next door to the school was Philadelphia International Records. When they were red hot. Practically every day you\u2019d be sighting Teddy Pendergrass, or members of the O\u2019Jays, the Jacksons, the Three Degrees or the Jones Girls. The Wawa store nearby wasn\u2019t as corporate as 7-11 but made good local deli sandwiches, so nine times out of 10 I\u2019d go to Wawa, hoping to God I\u2019d see a celebrity.</p> <p><strong>Between 1993 and 1998, which was the more starving period</strong> of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jul/12/the-roots-review-hip-hop-brixton-academy\">my band the Roots</a>, I had my base in London, in Kentish Town. We\u2019d go off and play France for two weeks, or Germany for a month or Italy for three weeks. In between we\u2019d have our hub in Kentish Town, above the fish and chip shop. During Thanksgiving we only had \u00a322 to feed the entire group. The answer was right below us. For \u00a322 you could get 12 pieces of cod and a mess of French fries and have change. So, my manager went to the shop across the street and got a whole bunch of cheese and tomato sauce. Then Tariq, my partner in the Roots spent the last pennies on a stick of butter and he got a pan, melted it, took all the chips, fine-chopped them until they were like a mashed paste, laid the cheese on top, then the tomato sauce, then the cod on top. We had a kind of tomato, cheese, fish and chip souffle that looked like a big lasagne. And it was like, \u201cWow!\u201d</p> <p><strong>Anthony Bourdain and I got along</strong> famously. He was very instrumental in me getting a table at Sukiyabashi Jiro [a restaurant in Japan], so we became fast friends. I asked him: \u201cIs it true that if you catch any of your staff playing Billy Joel in the kitchen they\u2019re instantly fired? Because I don\u2019t believe it.\u201d He replied: \u201cI\u2019ve fired three already. They did it, so they\u2019re gone. I won\u2019t have Joel\u2019s negative energy in my kitchen.\u201d When I heard of Anthony\u2019s death, I thought of the times he\u2019d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/dec/24/late-night-tv-bandleaders-the-roots-reggie-watts-fred-armisen\">come on the Jimmy Fallon show</a><em> </em>and ask, \u201cWhat are you playing as my intro?\u201d and I\u2019d say, \u201cYou\u2019re going to love it, Anthony \u2013 it\u2019ll be a great rocker\u201d, but then we\u2019d play him on to a Billy Joel. The day he died, the greatest tribute I thought I could give was to sort of troll him by creating the biggest Spotify account of music he absolutely hated.</p> <p><strong>The Roots\u2019 </strong><strong>fourth</strong><strong> album,</strong> <em>Things Fall Apart</em>, came together because we added a chef to our budget. The Zanzibar Blue\u2019s Terry was our favourite chef in Philly and we asked if he could cook for us every Friday for 15 weeks. He\u2019d come to my apartment around 5pm and just cook up a storm. Word got around and practically the whole musician community showed up. My house could comfortably hold maybe 18 people, but 60 or came. Not just any 60 people \u2013 Jill Scott, Mos Def, Common, De La Soul, Eve, Floetry \u2026 With great food we enticed people to collaborate with us and as a result yielded our first Grammy.</p> <p><strong>Later I started throwing</strong><strong> food salons </strong>and we carefully curated the guest list, almost as a social experiment. What if we put a doctor, this college professor and this upcoming model together? Or this lawyer, this actor and this comedian? Or Bj\u00f6rk, Chris Rock and Bob Woodward? After each, a couple of weeks or a month later, I\u2019d hear things about people who met at the salon and were working together. One joy is bringing different types of chefs together. Get Dominique Ansel, April Bloomfield and Daniel [Humm] from Eleven Madison Park in a room at the same time and they\u2019re collaborating.</p> <p><strong>My last stop before I go to Heathrow,</strong> at the end of visiting London, involves adding on an extra two hours so I can head to Beigel Bake [in Brick Lane] where Amy Winehouse first took me when I met her, to get a salt beef and a peanut butter one. I was stood in line for 40 or 50 minutes. I\u2019d go there before any high-end Michelin restaurant. <strong>I\u2019m the complete opposite of someone who won\u2019t let passengers have food and drink in my car</strong>. I still drive the Scion I got in 2004. My all-time favourite hobby is going to a cheesy drive-in movie in the Scion, even though drive-ins are few and far between now and you have to drive an hour and a half to find some run-down outdoor theatre. Recently we saw this weird Jaws-like film starring the daughters of both Sylvester Stallone and Jamie Foxx. We made a day of it, buying healthy popcorn, salami and cheese on the way and eating it throughout the film. My Scion is like my house, with a refrigerator in there. In fact, all my cars are like my house.</p> <p><strong>The last meal I had with my father</strong> before he died was on Father\u2019s Day. Me, my dad and my sister went to a seafood restaurant to have crabs, and this was around the time that my father was about to meet his new son-in-law \u2013 my sister\u2019s husband \u2013 for the first time and we made a family affair of it. It was a seafood crab festival, that\u2019s what we call it here. You kind of have all the seafood you can eat.</p> <p><strong>I\u2019ve been 260 days without any sugar</strong>. Although I gave myself time out during it. When I agreed to go sugarless for a year, I decided on four weeks in the middle as a lost weekend, like John Lennon. Two weeks before Christmas I was at my highest weight, 409 lbs. And thank God there\u2019s always a person in life to give yourself completely to, to fix yourself, when you can\u2019t fix it yourself. My personal chef, Adenia, is a life-saver.</p> <h2>My favourite things</h2> <p><strong>Food<br></strong>I\u2019m in a transitional period. Normally my default answer would be southern American soul food but I\u2019ve adopted a healthier lifestyle, exploring different foods to love that aren\u2019t detrimental to my health. My go-tos now are sushi, or just Japanese food in general.</p> <p><strong>Drink<br></strong>When I handed in the manuscript for [my book] <em>Something To Food About</em>, I felt shame.

The highlight on the latest Champions Day was definitely the victory of Magical in the Champion Stakes. Let\u2019s hope we see her at the Breeders\u2019 Cup - she\u2019s such a tough mare and Aidan O\u2019Brien \u2013 remarkably winning the race for the first time \u2013 said: \u201cShe is just incredible, but she is classy as well. What can you say about her? She is the ultimate racehorse, that is what she is. She is incredible. It looks like she is still progressing, which is amazing. The [lads] have to decide whether they want to go to the Breeders\u2019 Cup or not, and that would be the next one if they decide they want to go.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Stradivarius was just run out of it in the gruelling Long Distance Cup and, apart from Star Catcher, it was a frustrating day for Stradivarius\u2019 jockey Frankie Dettori, who was runner-up in the last race too. Racing on the inner (hurdles) course, where the Long Distance Cup was run, did not seem to have a detrimental effect on the action and Ascot certainly have that option in future for Champions Day. Hope you enjoyed the day and see you next time.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"74b7ac862a6296b9a137c12252e6528b6efd7f13\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/74b7ac862a6296b9a137c12252e6528b6efd7f13/0_150_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donnacha O\u2019Brien rides Magical (purple colours) to success in the Champion Stakes at Ascot.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donnacha O\u2019Brien rides Magical (purple colours) to success in the Champion Stakes at Ascot.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alan Crowhurst/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-19T16:01:09.208Z\">at 5.01pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dab2fa58f0804be72799dc2\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-19T15:49:48.170Z\">4.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Balmoral Handicap (4.40) result</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>1 <strong>Escobar</strong> (A Kirby) 16-1 <br>2 <strong>Lord North</strong> (L Dettori) 3-1 Fav <br>3 <strong>Mitchum Swagger</strong> (Rob Hornby) 28-1 <br>4 <strong>Glen Shiel</strong> (Hollie Doyle) 18-1 <br>20 ran <br>Non Runner: 8 </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dab2e158f0804be72799db7\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-19T15:43:51.042Z\">4.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Balmoral Handicap (4.40)</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>And they\u2019re off ...

I\u2019ve gone from crying to smiling in half an hour. She\u2019s lovely, she\u2019s tough - I think she\u2019s staying in training, with a bit of luck, and she\u2019s a wonderful filly. She\u2019s provided me with my 250th Group One and 18th this season, so I love her.\u201d <br><br>Victorious trainer John Gosden said: \u201cThat is the hope [to see her again next year]. [The ownwr] Mr Oppenheimer believes in racing his horses and he enjoys it immensely, so she should be racing next year. She is a lovely filly and a brave filly. America [for the Breeders\u2019 Cup] is too close and you can\u2019t go to America on 2 November after running a race like that. She has just left her heart on the track. To stick her neck in between them, she was very brave. </p> \n  <p>\u201cShe is a brave filly and she will have a winter off. It was a brave, wonderful performance.

While she has a couple of Group One victories to her name, this filly would have won four more, had it not been for Enable and Crystal Ocean. No rival of that standing faces her here and the step back to 10 furlongs should help after she again found the Arc too much of a test. This is her ninth run of the year, so she will need to be durable but the best effort of her 2018 campaign came in November.

He pulled all the muscles in his back just before Ascot. He barely made it back for the Irish St Leger and that race just didn\u2019t go right. He\u2019s an incredible horse. </p> \n  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible he\u2019ll be around next year. The lads will decide what they want to do. There is a big chance he will be. He\u2019s a very brave horse, so I\u2019m delighted. I\u2019d say the Gold Cup next year would definitely be the target if he stayed in training next year. I would imagine that\u2019s it for the season.\u201d </p> \n  <p>Gosden, trainer of Stradivarius, said: \u201cIt was too soft and he was not entirely happy on it. He didn\u2019t really love it through Swinley Bottom. It was very bold and sporting of Mr [Bjorn] Nielsen to run him, but he just found the ground too soft. </p> \n  <p>\u201cHe did well to win it last year as they went no pace. This year he found it too much of a slog in the ground. He has run a wonderful race and has come back in and had a whinny, so he is happy. </p> \n  <p>\u201cTake nothing away from the winner, we headed him and he\u2019s come back. It\u2019s not his ground, Frankie said he wasn\u2019t very happy through Swinley Bottom.

He was third in the race last year and he\u2019s such a legend - it\u2019s fantastic for King Power to win their first Group One race, there were a couple of anxious moments, but Silvestre managed to get himself out. </p> \n  <p>\u201cI\u2019m just so thrilled for the horse as he was the first horse the chairman ever bought - he\u2019d be so proud right now.\u201d He added: \u201cWe were quietly hopeful coming into it, but we needed everything to go right and we got a bit of luck in the end. He has been a star and has got easier to train. The head lad who works in his barn has worked hard on his joints, but this was always going to be his last race, as he is off to stud now in France now.

If you fancy a trip out for Champions Day here\u2019s an idea of what\u2019s on offer.<br><br>Juliet Slot, Ascot\u2019s chief commercial director, said: \u201cWe have a huge array of things going on. We\u2019ve got the Pony Club here with an enormous amount of activities trying to get young people to understand about racing; we\u2019ve got great films about following foals from the moment they are born until they get on the track.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got a students\u2019 area; there are a lot of different places to eat and a lot of different activities to engage with. I would encourage anyone to download our app \u2013 it just shows you how you can engage with the site here, especially if it is your first day here.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Asked what first-time Ascot visitors should do to maximise their enjoyment of the day, she replied: \u201cI always think there are some amazing hidden bars and areas of seating, generally towards the ends of the grandstands. There are some fantastic hidden lawns, such as the Grundy and Bustino Lawn and the Brigadier Gerard Lawn, which have tables and chairs and little bar areas.</p> \n  <p>\u201cIf you want to watch the racing, I always think you should go down to the rails. There\u2019s nothing like the thunder of the horses coming down. We\u2019re so lucky, we have a huge vista in front of the grandstand, so anywhere in front of the rails. And after racing we have brilliant music from Basement Jaxx.\u201d<br></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a5b84e45225f3d0dc26d337b1af9c1962a8a0082\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a5b84e45225f3d0dc26d337b1af9c1962a8a0082/0_187_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Simon Ratcliffe (left) and Felix Buxton of Basement Jaxx who perform after racing at Ascot today.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Simon Ratcliffe (left) and Felix Buxton of Basement Jaxx who perform after racing at Ascot today.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Hall/The Observer</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5daafca18f0898437061a24c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-19T12:10:07.855Z\">1.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">The Queen has arrived</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Suspect she\u2019s pleased to be at Ascot rather than be in parliament where she looked distinctly unhappy at having to read out Boris Johnson\u2019s words for the Queen\u2019s Speech earlier this week.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c0cef05af1a1674c0a9eabef35b92f6fd8fada2d\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c0cef05af1a1674c0a9eabef35b92f6fd8fada2d/1_0_2043_1226/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Queen arrives on Champions Day at Ascot.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Queen arrives on Champions Day at Ascot.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Cuthbert/UK Press via Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5daaf8118f08993584c89631\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-19T12:01:56.422Z\">1.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Can Dettori go through the card?</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Nicola McGeady at Ladbrokes has just been on Sky Sports Racing pointing out that Frankie Dettori is on four of the six favourites at Ascot today. We know what he did at Ascot in 1996 when he went <a href=\"https://www.ascot.co.uk/archive/magnificent7\">one better with the Magnificent Seven</a>. The approximate odds for a Frankie accumulator are 2,865-1.</p> \n  <p>A spokesperson from <a href=\"http://bookmakers.tv/\">bookmakers.tv</a> commented: \u201cChampions Day is perfectly placed to be a highlight in a bumper day of sport and the bookmakers are going all out to ensure the top class racing appeals as a betting proposition to the recreational customer, who\u2019ll no doubt have Frankie\u2019s Royal Ascot four-timer fresh in the memory.</p> \n  <p>\u201cBut short of battening down the hatches, on the basis the meeting has been one of mixed fortunes for punters over the years the firms don\u2019t appear to be running scared at all and the Dettori accumulator is being marketed aggressively. If he were to repeat the feat it would be a costly one - although not as much as the bookie reps may suggest - but the odds suggest it\u2019s a risk worth taking for the layers.\u201d<br></p> \n  <p>Ladbrokes current odds on Frankie\u2019s mounts ...<br></p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Advertise 7-2</li> \n   <li>Stadivarius 8-13</li> \n   <li>Star Catcher 13-8</li> \n   <li>King Of Comedy 7-1 (from 10-1)</li> \n   <li>Coronet 100-30</li> \n   <li>Lord North 100-30</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>If he does ride all six winners let\u2019s hope the next statue\u2019s a better one!</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"08a390e736e3fb22e33074a1d128ce16b7f038e7\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/08a390e736e3fb22e33074a1d128ce16b7f038e7/0_103_1152_1440/800.jpg\" alt=\"Frankie Dettori unveils the statue of himself at Ascotto commemorate the seven winners he rode on the same card five years earlier in 1996.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Frankie Dettori unveils the statue of himself at Ascotto commemorate the seven winners he rode on the same card five years earlier in 1996.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Hevezi/PA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-19T12:02:56.159Z\">at 1.02pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5daaf5458f08c78d1cb4eaf7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-19T11:37:59.591Z\">12.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Can you imagine Adam Gemili running up that Ascot straight?</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Ascot/status/1185519713515753472\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\ud83d\udde3 \"I'm glad I'm not the one running today!\"<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChampionsSeries?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@ChampionsSeries</a> Ambassador, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Adam_Gemili?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Adam_Gemili</a>, is looking forward to a terrific day of racing at QIPCO British Champions Day! <a href=\"https://t.co/0shlKvpoNy\">pic.twitter.com/0shlKvpoNy</a></p>\u2014 Ascot Racecourse (@Ascot) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Ascot/status/1185519713515753472?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 19, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5daaf0408f0859498cfb185f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-19T11:18:24.818Z\">12.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong><em>Non-runners</em></strong></p> \n  <p><strong>2.10pm QIPCO Long Distance Cup<br></strong>South Pacific (Vets Certificate, Abscess)<br><strong><br>4.40pm Balmoral Handicap<br></strong>Dunkirk Harbour (Vet\u2019s Certificate, Temperature)<br><br><strong><em>Detailed going news</em></strong><br></p> \n  <p>Straight Course:<strong> Heavy</strong><br>Inner Flat Course:<strong> Good to Soft, Soft in places</strong><br><em>GoingStick readings today at 8.15am: </em><em>Straight Course: 5.3; </em><em> </em><em>Inner Flat Course 6.6<br></em>Clerk of the Course Chris Stickels said: \u201cWe have been dry since 6pm yesterday and we are forecast a generally dry day, with the outside chance of a shower.\u201d</p> \n  <p>It\u2019s going to be tough going out there, never mind the testing ground the runners have to deal with there\u2019s also a strong headwind to contend with!<br><br></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/HughRacing/status/1185514629524611072\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Just been out onto straight track at Ascot as far as 4f pole.

No rival of that standing faces her here and the step back to 10 furlongs should help after she again found the Arc too much of a test.<br><br>This is her ninth run of the year, so she will need to be durable but the best effort of her 2018 campaign came in November.

She impressed in staying on bravely for second place at Longchamp, despite being the meat in the sandwich between Anapurna and Enbihaar close home. Antonia De Vega comes from a red-hot yard but might leave herself too much to do.<br><br><strong>3.20 Ascot</strong> It is easy to like the power-packed finishes produced by The Revenant this year and this ground should be no problem to the French raider but the value of his form is open to question. Benbatl, in contrast, is a top-class animal who might hate this mud. King Of Comedy has become tricky, while Magna Grecia and Mohaather have plenty to prove after missing the summer. So the way is open for an outsider like <strong>Happy Power </strong>to get involved. He has seemed to relish the chances he has had on soft ground and, on a fast surface, was beaten less than two lengths in the Sussex. The grey has sometimes pulled too hard early on but there should be a decent pace on here.<br><br><strong>4.40 Ascot</strong> A 12lb rise for winning the Cambridgeshire makes this tough for <strong>Lord North</strong> but the way he shot forwards once in the clear that day suggests he really does belong in a higher grade and he can end the day on a high for the Gosden / Dettori team. Kynren was a fair fifth a year ago but was running on empty at the line and is 8lb higher now.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5daae4878f0804be72799c70\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/gregwood\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-19T10:34:50.759Z\">11.34am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Welcome to Champions Day</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>There is positive news to start the day at Ascot, which has somehow managed to remain rain-free since 6pm on Friday evening allowing Chris Stickels, the clerk of the course, to report unchanged going: good-to-soft, soft in places on the inner hurdles track where much of the action will unfold, and heavy for the milers and sprinters on the straight course.</p> \n  <p>And it seems likely to stay that way, with the latest forecast suggesting \u201ca generally dry day with the outside risk of a shower\u201d, so a card that might have descended into a muddy farce should be able to take its proper place in an outstanding day of sporting action.<br></p> \n  <p>That said, it will be a tough, demanding afternoon for horses and jockeys alike.

      "bodyText": "... at least on the Flat anyway. The highlight on the latest Champions Day was definitely the victory of Magical in the Champion Stakes. Let\u2019s hope we see her at the Breeders\u2019 Cup - she\u2019s such a tough mare and Aidan O\u2019Brien \u2013 remarkably winning the race for the first time \u2013 said: \u201cShe is just incredible, but she is classy as well. What can you say about her? She is the ultimate racehorse, that is what she is. She is incredible. It looks like she is still progressing, which is amazing. The [lads] have to decide whether they want to go to the Breeders\u2019 Cup or not, and that would be the next one if they decide they want to go.\u201d Stradivarius was just run out of it in the gruelling Long Distance Cup and, apart from Star Catcher, it was a frustrating day for Stradivarius\u2019 jockey Frankie Dettori, who was runner-up in the last race too. Racing on the inner (hurdles) course, where the Long Distance Cup was run, did not seem to have a detrimental effect on the action and Ascot certainly have that option in future for Champions Day. Hope you enjoyed the day and see you next time. 1 Escobar (A Kirby) 16-1 2 Lord North (L Dettori) 3-1 Fav 3 Mitchum Swagger (Rob Hornby) 28-1 4 Glen Shiel (Hollie Doyle) 18-1 20 ran Non Runner: 8 And they\u2019re off ... Waarif is prominent early ... Coolagh Forest just the leader at halfway ... Lord North makes a challenge ... Escobar comes very late with a strong run to win with ease. You can find a full report of the Champion Stakes here A 12lb rise for winning the Cambridgeshire makes this tough for Lord North but the way he shot forwards once in the clear that day suggests he really does belong in a higher grade and he can end the day on a high for the Gosden/Dettori team. Kynren was a fair fifth a year ago but was running on empty at the line and is 8lb higher now.

I Can Fly slowly away but Addeybb is handy and Regal Reality leads early ... Magical moves up to second ... these two are clear of Fox Tal ... Magical goes for home and she gets the lead with Addeybb fighting hard to challenge but he can\u2019t get there. King Of Change ran out an authoritative winner of the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at Ascot. Winning trainer Richard Hannon said: \u201cI thought he\u2019d run well in the Guineas, but he had a hard race so we put him away - we thought it would be fast ground at Royal Ascot, but we got the first Royal Ascot in 10 years where it rained! \u201cAfter missing that we took our time and he came back to win his Listed race well. Sean said he\u2019s the best horse he\u2019s ever ridden, so he must give him some feel. You\u2019d love to be part of Royal Ascot, but it was always about next year for him. I\u2019m delighted for everyone. He\u2019s got lots of options, but it\u2019s a shorter winter on the back of a win like that.\u201d PA Media Magical \u2013 11/8 Coronet \u2013 4/1 Addeybb \u2013 6/1 Deirdre \u2013 9/1 Mehdaayih \u2013 16/1 Regal Reality \u2013 22/1 Fox Tal \u2013 25/1 I Can Fly \u2013 33/1 Pondus \u2013 40/1 Full betting here. Star Catcher rounded off her excellent campaign with victory in the Qipco British Champions Fillies &amp; Mares Stakes at Ascot. Winning jockey Frankie Dettori was bouncing straight back after defeat for Stradivarius in the Long Distance Cup, and was making it winner number 18 at Group One level this season. He said: \u201cObviously I\u2019m still a bit sour about Stradivarius, but the ground is a bit worse than we thought. I\u2019ve gone from crying to smiling in half an hour. She\u2019s lovely, she\u2019s tough - I think she\u2019s staying in training, with a bit of luck, and she\u2019s a wonderful filly. She\u2019s provided me with my 250th Group One and 18th this season, so I love her.\u201d Victorious trainer John Gosden said: \u201cThat is the hope [to see her again next year]. [The ownwr] Mr Oppenheimer believes in racing his horses and he enjoys it immensely, so she should be racing next year. She is a lovely filly and a brave filly. America [for the Breeders\u2019 Cup] is too close and you can\u2019t go to America on 2 November after running a race like that. She has just left her heart on the track. To stick her neck in between them, she was very brave. \u201cShe is a brave filly and she will have a winter off. It was a brave, wonderful performance. She is a very good filly, but she won the Vermeille on fast ground and she won in Ireland on quick ground.\u201d PA Media Aidan O\u2019Brien has won almost every top-class Flat race in Britain but one of the few to have evaded him is the Champion Stakes, which has not fallen to a raider from Ballydoyle since the Vincent O\u2019Brien-trained Sir Ivor in 1968. Magical can be horse to end that barren run and take the trophy back to Ireland. While she has a couple of Group One victories to her name, this filly would have won four more, had it not been for Enable and Crystal Ocean. No rival of that standing faces her here and the step back to 10 furlongs should help after she again found the Arc too much of a test. This is her ninth run of the year, so she will need to be durable but the best effort of her 2018 campaign came in November. She should outclass Addeybb, while Deirdre could have done with less rain this week. Fox Tal could outrun his odds. It\u2019s got tougher ... and will be for the big race, the Champion Stakes, next on the inner course. 1 King Of Change (S M Levey) 12-1 2 The Revenant (P C Boudot) 4-1 3 Safe Voyage (J P Spencer) 40-1 16 ran Also: 7-2 Fav Benbatl, 20-1 Veracious 4th And they\u2019re off ... Veracious leads the way from Phoenix Of Spain ... Magna Grecia is close up with Happy Power ... Veracious goes for home but King Of Change is now the new leader and is challenged by The Revenant but he can\u2019t catch the leader. It is easy to like the power-packed finishes produced by The Revenant this year and this ground should be no problem to the French raider but the value of his form is open to question. Benbatl, in contrast, is a top-class animal who might hate this mud. King Of Comedy has become tricky, while Magna Grecia and Mohaather have plenty to prove after missing the summer. So the way is open for an outsider like Happy Power to get involved. He has seemed to relish the chances he has had on soft ground and, on a fast surface, was beaten less than two lengths in the Sussex. The grey has sometimes pulled too hard early on but there should be a decent pace on here.

Stradivarius suffered his first defeat in almost two years as Kew Gardens came on top in a pulsating climax to the Qipco British Champions Long Distance Cup. Winning trainer Aidan O\u2019Brien said: \u201cWe were training him for the Gold Cup and he got an injury and it all went pear shaped so we\u2019re just so lucky to get him back. He pulled all the muscles in his back just before Ascot. He barely made it back for the Irish St Leger and that race just didn\u2019t go right. He\u2019s an incredible horse. \u201cIt\u2019s possible he\u2019ll be around next year. The lads will decide what they want to do. There is a big chance he will be. He\u2019s a very brave horse, so I\u2019m delighted. I\u2019d say the Gold Cup next year would definitely be the target if he stayed in training next year. I would imagine that\u2019s it for the season.\u201d Gosden, trainer of Stradivarius, said: \u201cIt was too soft and he was not entirely happy on it. He didn\u2019t really love it through Swinley Bottom. It was very bold and sporting of Mr [Bjorn] Nielsen to run him, but he just found the ground too soft. \u201cHe did well to win it last year as they went no pace. This year he found it too much of a slog in the ground. He has run a wonderful race and has come back in and had a whinny, so he is happy. \u201cTake nothing away from the winner, we headed him and he\u2019s come back. It\u2019s not his ground, Frankie said he wasn\u2019t very happy through Swinley Bottom. We came fairly close [to pulling him out], but it\u2019s Champions Day and we would have let the day down a bit if we didn\u2019t run Stradivarius. He has been beaten a nose, so there is no disgrace in that. It is just not his ground. We will be back for the Ascot Gold Cup on good to firm in good shape.\u201d PA Media 1 Star Catcher (L Dettori) 7-4 Fav 2 Delphinia (J A Heffernan) 20-1 3 Sun Maiden (Jim Crowley) 25-1 12 ran Also: 9-2 Fleeting 4th And they\u2019re off ...

Star Catcher will be hard to beat if Frankie Dettori is once more allowed his own way in front but that can\u2019t be taken for granted against 11 rivals with a big prize on the line. Delphinia appeals as an alternative, having made steady progress all year. She impressed in staying on bravely for second place at Longchamp, despite being the meat in the sandwich between Anapurna and Enbihaar close home.

She seems to be enjoying herself. As we know Brexit has split families (I\u2019ve not had the conversation yet with the brother-in-law thankfully) and Rachel is a strong supporter of Remain. Perhaps she\u2019s cheering on Oliver Letwin and hopes his amendment is carried in parliament today. 1 Kew Gardens (D O\u2019Brien) 7-2 2 Stradivarius (L Dettori) 8-13 Fav 3 Royal Line (R Havlin) 12-1 9 ran Also: 20-1 Mekong 4th Non Runner: 10 And they\u2019re off ...

Stradivarius cutting back the leader and he and Kew Gardens go past the post together ... photo-finish ... great race. Bookies on track going 5-1 on Kew Gardens ... and he has prevailed. Donjuan Triumphant lunged late to claim a poignant victory in the Qipco British Champions Sprint at Ascot. A field of 17 runners went to post for the six-furlong contest, with the William Haggas-trained mare One Master and Martyn Meade\u2019s Advertise the joint-favourites at 4-1. There were still several in with chances as the leaders raced inside the final furlong, with Denis Hogan\u2019s remarkable improver Make A Challenge - rated just 66 prior to six wins this season - looking the most likely winner after hitting the front. However, he was swamped by four runners as the post loomed and it was Andrew Balding\u2019s 33-1 shot Donjuan Triumphant who had his head in front where it mattered, scoring by a length in the hands of Silvestre de Sousa. Turning out just under a fortnight after claiming a second successive victory in the Prix de la Foret at ParisLongchamp, One Master ran a fine race to fill the runner-up spot, with Forever In Dreams and Brando close-up in third and fourth respectively. The win comes a year on from the tragic death of Leicester City owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, who founded King Power Racing, in whose blue and white colours Balding\u2019s charge runs. Balding said: \u201cHe\u2019s always come good in the autumn and I thought he ran a really good race last time behind Cape Byron, because he fluffed the start and things didn\u2019t go to plan. He was third in the race last year and he\u2019s such a legend - it\u2019s fantastic for King Power to win their first Group One race, there were a couple of anxious moments, but Silvestre managed to get himself out. \u201cI\u2019m just so thrilled for the horse as he was the first horse the chairman ever bought - he\u2019d be so proud right now.\u201d He added: \u201cWe were quietly hopeful coming into it, but we needed everything to go right and we got a bit of luck in the end. He has been a star and has got easier to train. The head lad who works in his barn has worked hard on his joints, but this was always going to be his last race, as he is off to stud now in France now. He will go to stud, but I\u2019m so pleased he has got a Group One for King Power.\u201d PA Media Even the bookies love Stradivarius The exceptional Stradivarius looks set for his 11th consecutive win, none of his rivals here posing an obvious threat. He might have got fed up on hock-deep ground but the switch to the drier inner track has removed even that potential trapdoor.

If you fancy a trip out for Champions Day here\u2019s an idea of what\u2019s on offer. Juliet Slot, Ascot\u2019s chief commercial director, said: \u201cWe have a huge array of things going on. We\u2019ve got the Pony Club here with an enormous amount of activities trying to get young people to understand about racing; we\u2019ve got great films about following foals from the moment they are born until they get on the track. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a students\u2019 area; there are a lot of different places to eat and a lot of different activities to engage with. I would encourage anyone to download our app \u2013 it just shows you how you can engage with the site here, especially if it is your first day here.\u201d Asked what first-time Ascot visitors should do to maximise their enjoyment of the day, she replied: \u201cI always think there are some amazing hidden bars and areas of seating, generally towards the ends of the grandstands. There are some fantastic hidden lawns, such as the Grundy and Bustino Lawn and the Brigadier Gerard Lawn, which have tables and chairs and little bar areas. \u201cIf you want to watch the racing, I always think you should go down to the rails. There\u2019s nothing like the thunder of the horses coming down. We\u2019re so lucky, we have a huge vista in front of the grandstand, so anywhere in front of the rails. And after racing we have brilliant music from Basement Jaxx.\u201d Suspect she\u2019s pleased to be at Ascot rather than be in parliament where she looked distinctly unhappy at having to read out Boris Johnson\u2019s words for the Queen\u2019s Speech earlier this week. Nicola McGeady at Ladbrokes has just been on Sky Sports Racing pointing out that Frankie Dettori is on four of the six favourites at Ascot today. We know what he did at Ascot in 1996 when he went one better with the Magnificent Seven. The approximate odds for a Frankie accumulator are 2,865-1. A spokesperson from bookmakers.tv commented: \u201cChampions Day is perfectly placed to be a highlight in a bumper day of sport and the bookmakers are going all out to ensure the top class racing appeals as a betting proposition to the recreational customer, who\u2019ll no doubt have Frankie\u2019s Royal Ascot four-timer fresh in the memory. \u201cBut short of battening down the hatches, on the basis the meeting has been one of mixed fortunes for punters over the years the firms don\u2019t appear to be running scared at all and the Dettori accumulator is being marketed aggressively. If he were to repeat the feat it would be a costly one - although not as much as the bookie reps may suggest - but the odds suggest it\u2019s a risk worth taking for the layers.\u201d Ladbrokes current odds on Frankie\u2019s mounts ...

Aidan O\u2019Brien has won almost every top-class Flat race in Britain but one of the few to have evaded him is the Champion Stakes, which has not fallen to a raider from Ballydoyle since the Vincent O\u2019Brien-trained Sir Ivor in 1968. Magical (4.00) can be horse to end that barren run and take the trophy back to Ireland. While she has a couple of Group One victories to her name, this filly would have won four more, had it not been for Enable and Crystal Ocean. No rival of that standing faces her here and the step back to 10 furlongs should help after she again found the Arc too much of a test. This is her ninth run of the year, so she will need to be durable but the best effort of her 2018 campaign came in November. She should outclass Addeybb, while Deirdre could have done with less rain this week. Fox Tal could outrun his odds. 1.35 Ascot This will be the softest ground Advertise has encountered by a long way and promises to be significantly more testing even than the Haydock ground through which Hello Youmzain ploughed so effectively last month.

Antonia De Vega comes from a red-hot yard but might leave herself too much to do. 3.20 Ascot It is easy to like the power-packed finishes produced by The Revenant this year and this ground should be no problem to the French raider but the value of his form is open to question. Benbatl, in contrast, is a top-class animal who might hate this mud. King Of Comedy has become tricky, while Magna Grecia and Mohaather have plenty to prove after missing the summer. So the way is open for an outsider like Happy Power to get involved. He has seemed to relish the chances he has had on soft ground and, on a fast surface, was beaten less than two lengths in the Sussex. The grey has sometimes pulled too hard early on but there should be a decent pace on here. 4.40 Ascot A 12lb rise for winning the Cambridgeshire makes this tough for Lord North but the way he shot forwards once in the clear that day suggests he really does belong in a higher grade and he can end the day on a high for the Gosden / Dettori team. Kynren was a fair fifth a year ago but was running on empty at the line and is 8lb higher now. There is positive news to start the day at Ascot, which has somehow managed to remain rain-free since 6pm on Friday evening allowing Chris Stickels, the clerk of the course, to report unchanged going: good-to-soft, soft in places on the inner hurdles track where much of the action will unfold, and heavy for the milers and sprinters on the straight course. And it seems likely to stay that way, with the latest forecast suggesting \u201ca generally dry day with the outside risk of a shower\u201d, so a card that might have descended into a muddy farce should be able to take its proper place in an outstanding day of sporting action. That said, it will be a tough, demanding afternoon for horses and jockeys alike. Heavy ground at Ascot is widely seen to be as gruelling as it gets, not least when it has had a few hours without rain allowing it to get a little \u201cgluey\u201d. The runners in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes , in particular, will need to get every inch of the mile, and even on the inner track, the runners in the Long Distance Cup and Champion Stakes may be grateful for the shorter trip in both events: 82yds less than normal for the stayers\u2019 race and 78yds less for the day\u2019s feature race. The early news in the betting is that Stradivarius, the only odds-on shot on the card, is a little uneasy in the market for the Long Distance Cup, drifting to 4-6 from an overnight price of 4-7 with most firms, following support for Aidan O\u2019Brien\u2019s Kew Gardens. Donnacha O\u2019Brien, the trainer\u2019s son, will be aboard his father\u2019s main runners this afternoon as Ryan Moore, the stable jockey, seems to have drawn the short straw by heading to Australia to trail home last on Ten Sovereigns in the hugely valuable Everest a few hours ago. And it could be a big day for Ireland\u2019s reigning champion jockey as Magna Grecia, who took the 2,000 Guineas at Newmarket with O\u2019Brien in the saddle back in May, has joined The Revenant at the top of a very open market for the QEII, with both runners available at 5-1. Chris Cook\u2019s tips for today\u2019s races are in his preview here and listed below and all the news and views from Ascot will be in this space as the richest afternoon in British racing unfolds from 1.50.",

He says that he has only belatedly realised that such sentiments as \u201cI know you want it\u201d and guest rapper TI\u2019s lyric: \u201cI\u2019ll give you something big enough to tear your ass in two\u201d could be considered \u201crapey\u201d. Now Williams says: \u201cSome of my old songs, I would never write or sing today. I get embarrassed\u2026 It just took a lot of time and growth to get there.\u201d Williams adds: \u201cI realised that we live in a chauvinist culture\u2026 Didn\u2019t realise that [some] of my songs catered to that. So that blew my mind.\u201d</p> <p>And there you have it, folks \u2013 behold the pop-cultural phenomenon of Delayed Woke. The generally male, conveniently belated mea culpa of sexism, which seems to say that you can behave as you like as long as you\u2019re very apologetic at some unspecified point in the future.</p> <p>No one is claiming that Blurred Lines was the first ever sexist song. Nor is it only Williams who is guilty of delayed wokery. Snoop Dogg said that he didn\u2019t regret initially blasting women as \u201cbitches\u201d and \u201cwhores\u201d, as he later grew to respect women, going on to view his early material as merely a marker for how far from misogyny he had come (so glad that womankind could help with your \u201cjourney\u201d, Snoop!).</p> <p>Elsewhere, after the comedian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/dec/31/louis-ck-parkland-survivors-standup-routine\" title=\"\">Louis CK</a> was pilloried for masturbating in front of women, he \u201capologised\u201d (ish) by incorporating his infamy into his act, perhaps proving that, for some, woke ends up permanently delayed.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Blurred Lines wasn't 'different' times. All this happened, not in yon olden pop days, but in 2013</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Then there are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2014/may/12/10-of-the-best-beastie-boys-readers-choice\" title=\"\">Beastie Boys</a>, who were slammed for misogyny around their first album, <em>Licensed to Ill</em> (women dancing on stage in cages and the like). However, not only were the Beasties very young, they listened to criticism, later apologising in a song (Sure Shot), and renouncing chauvinism. By contrast, Williams was already 40 when Blurred Lines was released. But hey, I suppose some artists need more \u201ctime and growth\u201d than others.</p> <p>Am I being too harsh on Williams? Possibly. At least he\u2019s no longer defending Blurred Lines with such <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/may/29/pharrell-sexually-suggestive-blurred-lines-the-new-black-hillary-clinton\" title=\"\">zingers</a> as: \u201cIs it sexually suggestive when a car salesman says to a person who is trying to buy a car, \u2018I know you want it\u2019?\u201d (Yup, an actual quote from 2014.) However, this former music hack knows that releasing a pop song is a fairly lengthy process, with plenty of time for a seasoned professional to reflect that things had become \u201crapey\u201d.</p> <p>In short, I don\u2019t entirely buy this \u201challelujah \u2013 I\u2019ve seen the chauvinist light!\u201d routine that adult men belatedly come out with \u2013 after, say, they have banked all the global royalties and noted not only the #MeToo storm but also how admired artists such as John Legend are for their pro-feminist mindsets.</p> <p>Let\u2019s face it, Blurred Lines wasn\u2019t \u201cdifferent times\u201d. All this happened, not in yon olden pop days, but in 2013. It\u2019s sweet that Williams finally, as he says, \u201cgot it\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Musician Pharrell Williams says he is now \u201cembarrassed\u201d by Blurred Lines, his controversial hit with Robin Thicke. He says that he has only belatedly realised that such sentiments as \u201cI know you want it\u201d and guest rapper TI\u2019s lyric: \u201cI\u2019ll give you something big enough to tear your ass in two\u201d could be considered \u201crapey\u201d. Now Williams says: \u201cSome of my old songs, I would never write or sing today. I get embarrassed\u2026 It just took a lot of time and growth to get there.\u201d Williams adds: \u201cI realised that we live in a chauvinist culture\u2026 Didn\u2019t realise that [some] of my songs catered to that. So that blew my mind.\u201d And there you have it, folks \u2013 behold the pop-cultural phenomenon of Delayed Woke. The generally male, conveniently belated mea culpa of sexism, which seems to say that you can behave as you like as long as you\u2019re very apologetic at some unspecified point in the future. No one is claiming that Blurred Lines was the first ever sexist song. Nor is it only Williams who is guilty of delayed wokery. Snoop Dogg said that he didn\u2019t regret initially blasting women as \u201cbitches\u201d and \u201cwhores\u201d, as he later grew to respect women, going on to view his early material as merely a marker for how far from misogyny he had come (so glad that womankind could help with your \u201cjourney\u201d, Snoop!). Elsewhere, after the comedian Louis CK was pilloried for masturbating in front of women, he \u201capologised\u201d (ish) by incorporating his infamy into his act, perhaps proving that, for some, woke ends up permanently delayed. Then there are Beastie Boys, who were slammed for misogyny around their first album, Licensed to Ill (women dancing on stage in cages and the like). However, not only were the Beasties very young, they listened to criticism, later apologising in a song (Sure Shot), and renouncing chauvinism. By contrast, Williams was already 40 when Blurred Lines was released. But hey, I suppose some artists need more \u201ctime and growth\u201d than others. Am I being too harsh on Williams? Possibly. At least he\u2019s no longer defending Blurred Lines with such zingers as: \u201cIs it sexually suggestive when a car salesman says to a person who is trying to buy a car, \u2018I know you want it\u2019?\u201d (Yup, an actual quote from 2014.) However, this former music hack knows that releasing a pop song is a fairly lengthy process, with plenty of time for a seasoned professional to reflect that things had become \u201crapey\u201d. In short, I don\u2019t entirely buy this \u201challelujah \u2013 I\u2019ve seen the chauvinist light!\u201d routine that adult men belatedly come out with \u2013 after, say, they have banked all the global royalties and noted not only the #MeToo storm but also how admired artists such as John Legend are for their pro-feminist mindsets. Let\u2019s face it, Blurred Lines wasn\u2019t \u201cdifferent times\u201d. All this happened, not in yon olden pop days, but in 2013. It\u2019s sweet that Williams finally, as he says, \u201cgot it\u201d. Then again, Pharrell, what took you so long? Writing a motto for anorexics is hardly holistic, Gwyneth We have become accustomed to Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s wellness-quackery, via her Goop site. Many will recall her advice to steam your vagina \u2013 only expensively, mind, ladies; it wouldn\u2019t be holistic just to throw your knickers off and crouch over a scalding, billowing kettle spout, DIY-style. However, groundbreaking as Paltrow has been over the years, she and Goop need to be careful that they don\u2019t cross the line and become dangerous. Goop recently published a Q&amp;A about achieving one\u2019s \u201cleanest liveable weight\u201d, angering and dismaying those who try to help people with eating disorders. In fairness, the person being interviewed, Traci Mann, a professor of psychology at the University of Minnesota, is against strict dieting and her argument directly relates to an individual\u2019s \u201cleanest liveable weight\u201d \u2013 without extreme steps.

      "bodyText": "Sympathy is rarely felt for a rival rugby nation yet it was impossible to suppress pangs of exactly that emotion for Ireland. The cruel, crushing nature of this seventh World Cup quarter-final exit has never been so severely inflicted. As the Ireland coach, Joe Schmidt, exclaimed, the scars of this defeat will remain for some time. There could be no more brutal way to sign off his tenure. While Ireland knew the All Blacks would respond after two defeats in their last three meetings, they were powerless to stop it. Four years ago it was a similar theme. The All Blacks arrived at the World Cup quarter-finals to meet France, their supposed World Cup nemesis. Playing at the same Cardiff venue, memories of 2007 were rolled out in the build-up. The All Blacks bottled that fury and produced one of their best performances on this stage, sweeping France aside to win 62-13. Their new nemesis suffered the same fate. Andy Farrell\u2019s defensive blueprint rattled the All Blacks with the British &amp; Irish Lions and Ireland twice before. Yet here at Tokyo Stadium, his green wall came crumbling down as the All Blacks skipped to the edge with consummate ease. After watching New Zealand take Ireland apart in this seven-try masterclass, the England coach, Eddie Jones, may want to retract his statement about looking forward to facing the holders in next Saturday\u2019s semi-finals.

      "bodyText": "After another tumultuous week in Washington, with the prospect of impeachment growing by the day, Donald Trump faced a stinging rebuke from the man who holds the president\u2019s fate in his hands: the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell. In a column for the Washington Post, the Kentucky Republican lambasted the president for making \u201ca grave strategic mistake\u201d in seeking to withdraw US troops from Syria, a move which allowed Turkey to attack Kurdish forces previously allied with the US against the Islamic State. The impeachment inquiry in the House is focused on Trump\u2019s attempts to have Ukraine investigate Joe Biden, a leading contender for the Democratic nomination. Testimony from key Trump aides has brought closer a vote on impeachment and thus a Senate trial. A two-thirds majority would be needed to convict and remove the president. The New York Times reported this week that McConnell has begun preparing his caucus, offering a PowerPoint presentation \u201ccomplete with quotes from the constitution, as he schooled fellow senators on the intricacies of a process he portrayed as all but inevitable\u201d. Most observers, including the New York Times, think McConnell\u2019s grip on a party loath to break with Trump renders conviction unlikely. McConnell has vowed to stop it. But as some Republican moderates will face pressure at the ballot box over impeachment, so foreign policy remains a key GOP interest, particularly the need for the US to look strong and to fight Islamic extremists. This week, as the Trump administration scrambled to contain the damage in Syria, fighting continued and Russian troops moved in to fill the vacuum, dismay over Trump\u2019s capitulation to Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan spread among Republican senators. McConnell\u2019s rebuke was both oblique and partisan: he did not mention Trump by name and he did mention, and blame, Barack Obama three times. But it was nonetheless a rebuke. \u201cThere is no substitute for American leadership,\u201d he wrote. \u201cNo other nation can match our capability to spearhead multinational campaigns that can defeat terrorists and help stabilise the region. Libya and Syria both testify to the bloody results of the Obama administration\u2019s \u2018leading from behind\u2019.\u201d McConnell also made pointed reference to bipartisan agreement in the Senate. \u201cIn January,\u201d he wrote, \u201cfollowing indications that the president was considering withdrawing US forces from Syria and Afghanistan \u2026 the Senate stepped up. A bipartisan supermajority of 70 senators supported an amendment I wrote [which] stated our opposition to prematurely exiting Syria or Afghanistan.\u201d McConnell said he had been \u201cdisheartened that nearly all the Senate Democrats running for president\u201d did not back the amendment but \u201cthe consensus position of nearly all Republicans and a number of Democrats was encouraging\u201d. Democratic presidential contenders support the impeachment process. No Republican senators have yet said they do \u2013 the former Ohio governor and 2016 presidential hopeful John Kasich did so on Friday \u2013 but criticism of Trump, not only by his frequent critic Mitt Romney of Utah but from allies such as Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, is more often to be heard. The former senator Jeff Flake has said that if a vote were held in private, as many as 35 Republicans would vote to remove Trump. Presuming all Democrats and independents did so, 20 defections would be enough. A rolling drumbeat of reports and revelations continues to increase pressure that has caused Trump, characteristically, to lash out on Twitter, backing his position on Syria, attempting to question the validity of the impeachment inquiry and attacking its leaders in viciously personal terms. On Saturday morning, the president opened with simply: \u201c#StopTheCoup.\u201d He had reason to tweet more. On Friday, CNN reported that Rudy Giuliani, the former New York mayor commonly described as Trump\u2019s personal lawyer and a leading player in the president\u2019s Ukraine policy, had pressed the White House and state department to grant a visa to Viktor Shokin. Shokin, formerly Ukraine\u2019s top prosecutor, was removed under international pressure led by Biden as vice-president to Obama, because he was seen as weak on corruption. Trump and his allies allege that Biden wanted to relieve pressure on his own son, Hunter Biden, who was on the board of a Ukrainian energy company. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Biden but Hunter Biden has been moved to defend himself, relinquishing a position tied to China and saying this week he regretted his involvement in what he called a \u201cswamp\u201d in Ukraine. Giuliani has said Shokin promised to reveal \u201cdirt\u201d on Democrats. CNN\u2019s report was based on testimony to House committees by George Kent, a state department official. Others who have offered testimony damaging to Trump include the former Ukraine ambassador Marie Yovanovitch; the British-born former White House adviser Fiona Hill; and the current European Union ambassador, Gordon Sondland. A battle over access to records pertaining to Ukraine goes on. This week, Giuliani said he would not comply with a subpoena. The energy secretary, Rick Perry, embroiled in the Ukraine scandal, announced his resignation. But the most damaging blow came from inside the White House. The key issue is whether Trump offered Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy a quid pro quo: an unfreezing of nearly $400m in US military aid in return for what Trump called in a 25 July phone call \u201ca favour\u201d. On Thursday, the acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, suggested there had been such a deal, and told reporters to \u201cget over it\u201d \u2013 a slogan which swiftly appeared on T-shirts as the Trump fundraising juggernaut rolled on. Amid reported dismay in Trump\u2019s inner circle, Mulvaney tried to walk his comments back. He did not seem to succeed. \u201cIt\u2019s not an Etch-A-Sketch,\u201d Francis Rooney, a Florida Republican, told the New York Times, miming use of the toy, which lets children erase their doodles and start again. \u201cThere were a lot of Republicans looking at that headline yesterday when it came up. I certainly was.\u201d",

He studied at&nbsp;Eton and then Trinity College, Cambridge, and first became a Conservative MP in 1997.</p>\n    <p>However, his political career had started long before then, as he had served in Margaret Thatcher's policy unit from 1983 to 1986. The poll tax was an idea Letwin almost single-handedly kept alive in the mid-1980s. In a 1985 memo, he suggested it could be introduced in Scotland first as \u201ca trailblazer for the real thing\u201d.</p>\n    <p>In 2016 Letwin was forced to apologise after it emerged he had co-written a paper telling Thatcher that providing financial assistance for black unemployed youth after the 1985 riots would only end up in the \u201cdisco and drug trade\u201d. The memo, Letwin admitted, was \u201cbadly worded and wrong\u201d.</p>\n    <p>Letwin was forced into hiding in 2001 by a desperate Conservative party, after being outed as the minister who had&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/may/21/uk.election200115\">promis</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/may/21/uk.election200115\">ed \u00a320bn of tax and spending cuts</a>&nbsp;in an anonymous interview with the Financial Times, far beyond the party\u2019s manifesto at the time.</p>\n    <p>In many respects, the best periods of Letwin\u2019s career were in the policy engine room, not least when he acted as David Cameron\u2019s fixer, when he was a cabinet office minister in the coalition government. His influence went far beyond the ministerial title.</p>\n    <p>Then he wrestled with issues such as the future of press regulation in the aftermath of the Leveson inquiry. Letwin\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/dec/20/oliver-letwin-leveson-reforms\">big idea</a>, to deal with the fact that newspapers refused to accept statutory regulation, was to create an independent regulator backed by royal charter. It was neat, but the mainstream press refused to accept it.</p>\n    <p>Letwin has emerged as an unlikely Brexit rebel, going from being the ultimate loyalist to serial rebel, beginning in January 2019 when he voted with Labour to give Theresa May a two-week deadline to debate Brexit next steps if her deal was voted down.</p>\n    <p>\u201cMy right honourable friend&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?p=10555\">Sir Nicholas Soames</a>, who is sitting next to me, and I have calculated that we have been in the house, collectively, for 56 years, and we have only ever, either of us, voted once against the Conservative whip,\u201d Letwin said.</p>\n    <p>A month later his concerns had hardened, as demonstrated in a Commons speech in which he worried that \u201cwhen the chips are down\u201d the government \u201cwould prefer to do what some of my esteemed colleagues would prefer to do: head for the exit door without a deal\u201d.

Instead of backing Johnson\u2019s agreement in a \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d, MPs passed an amendment tabled by a cross-party group of MPs led by Oliver Letwin by 322 votes to 306 \u2013 a majority of 16. The prime minister said he was not \u201cdaunted or dismayed\u201d by the defeat, and would press ahead with tabling Brexit legislation next week. MPs are likely to take the opportunity to table a string of amendments, including on trying to force a second referendum. The move by cross-party MPs was aimed at forcing Johnson to comply with the terms of the Benn act, which obliges him to write to the EU to request a Brexit delay, if he had not won approval for his deal by 11pm. But Johnson insisted: \u201cI will not negotiate a delay with the EU, and neither does the law compel me to do so\u201d \u2013 a claim that is likely to see him face a legal challenge. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said: \u201cThe prime minister must now comply with the law. He can no longer use the threat of a no-deal crash-out to blackmail MPs to support his sellout deal.\u201d The clashes came during a historic Saturday sitting of parliament, during which the PM adopted an emollient tone as he implored MPs to throw their weight behind his deal. \u201cLet us come together as democrats behind this deal, the one proposition that fulfils the verdict of the majority but which also allows us to bring together the two halves of our hearts, to bring together the two halves of our nation,\u201d he urged them. \u201cLet us go for a deal that can heal this country and allow us all to express our legitimate desires for the deepest possible friendship and partnership with our neighbours. A deal that allows us to create a new shared destiny with them.\u201d But the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, vehemently rejected Johnson\u2019s arguments in a forensic speech highlighting the deal\u2019s differences with Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal agreement, including the absence of legal guarantees on workers\u2019 rights. Starmer concluded: \u201cThe deal before this house is a thoroughly bad deal for jobs, rights and living standards, a bad deal for the future direction of this country \u2013 it will put us on the path to an entirely different economy and society: one of deregulation and divergence.\u201d \u201cManufacturing having been on its knees, and now having revived at least in part, how anyone could take an axe to it I will never understand. If we pass this deal today it will be a long way back for the communities we represent.\u201d Letwin said he was minded to support Johnson\u2019s deal, but the aim of his amendment was \u201cto keep in place the insurance policy provided by the Benn act, which prevents us from crashing out automatically if there is no deal by 31 October\u201d. Johnson hinted in his speech before the vote that EU leaders could rebuff any British request for a delay. \u201cI must tell the house in all candour that there is very little appetite among our friends in the EU for this business to be protracted by one extra day,\u201d he said. He told MPs: \u201cWhatever letters they may seek to force the government to write, it cannot change my judgment that further delay is pointless, expensive and deeply corrosive of public trust.\u201d A spokeswoman for the European commission said it was up to the UK government to make the next move after the developments in the Commons. She said: \u201cThe European commission takes note of the vote in the House of Commons today on the so-called Letwin amendment meaning that the withdrawal agreement itself was not put to vote today. \u201cIt will be for the UK government to inform us about the next steps as soon as possible.\u201d A spokesman for the European council president, Donald Tusk, declined to comment. Ambassadors for the EU27 will meet on Sunday morning to discuss the latest developments. After being defeated on the amendment, the government and opposition agreed not to hold a vote on the amended motion, which Downing Street sources said they considered \u201cmeaningless\u201d. The leader of the House of Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, then told MPs the government would seek to hold another meaningful vote on Johnson\u2019s deal on Monday \u2013 something the Speaker, John Bercow, said he would have to decide whether to allow. Before Letwin tabled his amendment, Downing Street had appeared tantalisingly close to achieving majority support for the last-minute deal the prime minister secured on Thursday, which outlines a looser economic relationship with the EU. Ardent Eurosceptics including Mark Francois and Bill Cash had signalled that they would support the deal, despite the objections of the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist party (DUP). And several Labour MPs, including Melanie Onn and Sarah Champion, who had rejected Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal agreement, signalled that they too were ready to vote with the government. The DUP\u2019s backing was key to the success of Letwin\u2019s amendment, after the party rejected Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal on Thursday. It was also supported by 10 independent former Conservatives, including David Gauke and Philip Hammond. In a passionate speech to the Commons, the DUP MP Sammy Wilson said that the agreement would cut off Northern Ireland from the country \u201cto which we belong\u201d. \u201cWe will not give in to this agreement which we believe does damage to our part of the United Kingdom and which will lead to the focus of attention away from London, towards Dublin,\u201d he said. Tory MPs left the chamber en masse when the SNP MP Joanna Cherry, who was involved in recent legal action aimed at forcing Johnson to comply with the Benn act, rose to speak. She asked Bercow whether he would be prepared to sign a letter to the EU requesting an extension, if necessary. \u201cWere I instructed by this house, I would do as instructed, and if I were instructed by a court, I would do as directed,\u201d he replied. Briefing journalists after the government\u2019s defeat, the prime minister\u2019s official spokesman stonewalled questions about how Johnson planned to avoid negotiating a delay. \u201cWe are not going to add anything to the PM\u2019s words in the house,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cGovernments comply with the law.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Not many people can say that they share an address with Leonardo da Vinci, but Massimo Alba can. The fashion designer\u2019s Milan apartment is part of the Casa degli Atellani, an elegant palazzo and one of the city\u2019s most celebrated museums. It is also home to the vineyard gifted to da Vinci by the Duke of Milan, Ludovico Maria Sforza, in 1498.</p> <p>\u201cEvery time I come home, I feel privileged to be living in this terrific place, surrounded by good energy,\u201d says Alba as he leads the way through the museum to the garden where the Renaissance artist tended to his vines.</p> <p>Alba\u2019s home, which he shares with his wife Marilena and their 14-year-old son, Nicol\u00f2, is situated on the first floor, but our tour starts in the sun-dappled gardens. Alba is keen to highlight the harmonious juxtaposition between past and present that inspires not only his work but his apartment, too. </p> <p>The 59-year old designer and his family moved here shortly after their home on the island of Ischia was destroyed by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/21/earthquake-strikes-italian-island-of-ischia-with-one-reported-dead\" title=\"\">2017 earthquake</a>. They had already sold their other two properties in and around Milan to raise capital to set up his eponymous label, so when the Casa degli Atellani\u2019s current owners, the Portaluppi family, suggested Alba rented one of the storied dwellings, the family saw it as an opportunity to start their next chapter.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4ca1a526bbaf701f9c8491f2f6d06ce5c334bb3a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4ca1a526bbaf701f9c8491f2f6d06ce5c334bb3a/0_156_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sweet dreams: the bedroom in peaceful grey, in keeping with the rest of the apartment.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sweet dreams: the bedroom in peaceful grey, in keeping with the rest of the apartment.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marco Bertolini/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t really own things [in life], only emotions,\u201d reflects Alba, explaining that no longer being a proprietor \u2013 much like running his independent brand \u2013 makes him feel, \u201cin a funny way, free\u201d.</p> <p>The apartment is peppered with mementos from the past. When you step into the apartment you\u2019re met with a treasure \u201cfrom a lifetime ago\u201d: an exquisite Tibetan chest that sits beneath a high ceiling. Beyond is an open-plan kitchen, dining room and living area with a retro floor-to-ceiling shelving system that acts as a room divider.</p> <p>Taking centre stage, the shelving unit is covered in dog-eared paperbacks piled high, unframed canvases, souvenirs, family photographs, hand-written notes, candlesticks, paperweights and small vintage lamps picked up at markets and auctions. It acts as a captivating storyboard of lives spent and shared.</p> <p>So, too, the artwork that covers the walls. Black and white photography and abstract oil paintings by Lillian Bassman, Kenro Izu, Evelyn Hofer and Fran\u00e7ois Berthoud sit on floating shelves along one wall that stretches the length of the apartment. Meanwhile, giant scenes by French fashion photographer Patrick Demarchelier and the Sicilian photographer Ferdinando Scianna stand side by side on the floor next to a small sculpted chair by Tom Dixon.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b7dede5fb816fbfec142199b72ffda8bf0f8e357\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b7dede5fb816fbfec142199b72ffda8bf0f8e357/0_0_4000_6000/667.jpg\" alt=\"Cooking up something special: the kitchen, with its collection of vintage glassware.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cooking up something special: the kitchen, with its collection of vintage glassware.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marco Bertolini/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On the opposite wall, giant windows frame the view of the <a href=\"https://legraziemilano.it/\" title=\"\">Santa Maria delle Grazie</a> church across the road where da Vinci, commissioned by Sforza, painted <em>The Last Supper</em> in 1498, where it still hangs to this day.</p> <p>\u201cIn a certain way, our home is a melting pot, everything is slightly different, from a different place in time,\u201d says Alba. As with the collections that he and Marilena design to be seasonless, comfortable and worn with everything else in your wardrobe, his home is a holistic extension of that. \u201cWe never look at each item; we look at the way items work with other items. We don\u2019t want to change every season \u2013 we want to follow our inner voice and instinct.\u201d</p> <p>Many of the pieces have sentimental value. Midcentury chairs by Danish and Italian designers including Hans Wegner and Gio Ponti are decorated with cushions Alba had embroidered by his friend, the artist Roberto Reale. They read: \u201cHappiness is not in another place but in this place, not in another hour, but in this hour,\u201d and \u201cHello there.\u201d A lampshade also features needlework by Reale that reads: \u201c<em>M\u2019illumino d\u2019immenso</em>.\u201d It translates as: \u201cI flood myself with the light of the immense,\u201d and is a quote from the late Italian modernist poet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/may/31/featuresreviews.guardianreview6\" title=\"\">Giuseppe Ungaretti</a>, whose poetry Alba\u2019s son was recently studying at school.</p> <p>Tibetan rugs, which overlap each other across the floor, have been hand-painted by Alba \u2013 himself a keen artist whose line of painted handkerchiefs has become a signature of his brand. Beds are draped in blankets he designed with the Scottish cashmere company <a href=\"https://www.beggandcompany.com/\" title=\"\">Begg &amp; Co</a>. The kitchen, where I\u2019m told generous servings of pasta and wine are served up for regular dinner-party guests, is decorated with classic Sicilian head vases, vintage mismatched glassware and family relics passed down from parents.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"08e8f2309f9701a1f20f65208889c85162b92ae1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/08e8f2309f9701a1f20f65208889c85162b92ae1/0_400_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018We follow our instinct\u2019: Massimo Alba at home.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We follow our instinct\u2019:<strong> </strong>Massimo Alba at home.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marco Bertolini/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cPersonally, I like it when things from different times become friends and live together \u2013 something from the 50s, something from the 30s,\u201d explains Alba. \u201cI really feel it\u2019s home.

      "bodyText": "Not many people can say that they share an address with Leonardo da Vinci, but Massimo Alba can. The fashion designer\u2019s Milan apartment is part of the Casa degli Atellani, an elegant palazzo and one of the city\u2019s most celebrated museums. It is also home to the vineyard gifted to da Vinci by the Duke of Milan, Ludovico Maria Sforza, in 1498. \u201cEvery time I come home, I feel privileged to be living in this terrific place, surrounded by good energy,\u201d says Alba as he leads the way through the museum to the garden where the Renaissance artist tended to his vines. Alba\u2019s home, which he shares with his wife Marilena and their 14-year-old son, Nicol\u00f2, is situated on the first floor, but our tour starts in the sun-dappled gardens. Alba is keen to highlight the harmonious juxtaposition between past and present that inspires not only his work but his apartment, too. The 59-year old designer and his family moved here shortly after their home on the island of Ischia was destroyed by the 2017 earthquake. They had already sold their other two properties in and around Milan to raise capital to set up his eponymous label, so when the Casa degli Atellani\u2019s current owners, the Portaluppi family, suggested Alba rented one of the storied dwellings, the family saw it as an opportunity to start their next chapter. \u201cYou don\u2019t really own things [in life], only emotions,\u201d reflects Alba, explaining that no longer being a proprietor \u2013 much like running his independent brand \u2013 makes him feel, \u201cin a funny way, free\u201d. The apartment is peppered with mementos from the past. When you step into the apartment you\u2019re met with a treasure \u201cfrom a lifetime ago\u201d: an exquisite Tibetan chest that sits beneath a high ceiling. Beyond is an open-plan kitchen, dining room and living area with a retro floor-to-ceiling shelving system that acts as a room divider. Taking centre stage, the shelving unit is covered in dog-eared paperbacks piled high, unframed canvases, souvenirs, family photographs, hand-written notes, candlesticks, paperweights and small vintage lamps picked up at markets and auctions. It acts as a captivating storyboard of lives spent and shared. So, too, the artwork that covers the walls. Black and white photography and abstract oil paintings by Lillian Bassman, Kenro Izu, Evelyn Hofer and Fran\u00e7ois Berthoud sit on floating shelves along one wall that stretches the length of the apartment. Meanwhile, giant scenes by French fashion photographer Patrick Demarchelier and the Sicilian photographer Ferdinando Scianna stand side by side on the floor next to a small sculpted chair by Tom Dixon. On the opposite wall, giant windows frame the view of the Santa Maria delle Grazie church across the road where da Vinci, commissioned by Sforza, painted The Last Supper in 1498, where it still hangs to this day. \u201cIn a certain way, our home is a melting pot, everything is slightly different, from a different place in time,\u201d says Alba. As with the collections that he and Marilena design to be seasonless, comfortable and worn with everything else in your wardrobe, his home is a holistic extension of that. \u201cWe never look at each item; we look at the way items work with other items. We don\u2019t want to change every season \u2013 we want to follow our inner voice and instinct.\u201d Many of the pieces have sentimental value. Midcentury chairs by Danish and Italian designers including Hans Wegner and Gio Ponti are decorated with cushions Alba had embroidered by his friend, the artist Roberto Reale. They read: \u201cHappiness is not in another place but in this place, not in another hour, but in this hour,\u201d and \u201cHello there.\u201d A lampshade also features needlework by Reale that reads: \u201cM\u2019illumino d\u2019immenso.\u201d It translates as: \u201cI flood myself with the light of the immense,\u201d and is a quote from the late Italian modernist poet Giuseppe Ungaretti, whose poetry Alba\u2019s son was recently studying at school. Tibetan rugs, which overlap each other across the floor, have been hand-painted by Alba \u2013 himself a keen artist whose line of painted handkerchiefs has become a signature of his brand. Beds are draped in blankets he designed with the Scottish cashmere company Begg &amp; Co. The kitchen, where I\u2019m told generous servings of pasta and wine are served up for regular dinner-party guests, is decorated with classic Sicilian head vases, vintage mismatched glassware and family relics passed down from parents. \u201cPersonally, I like it when things from different times become friends and live together \u2013 something from the 50s, something from the 30s,\u201d explains Alba. \u201cI really feel it\u2019s home. I feel close to everything I like.\u201d Warm and inviting, it\u2019s a home that is lived in, not looked at; the kind of space that speaks style and whispers \u201cwell-travelled\u201d with a curiosity in every corner and a cup of coffee on the table. It\u2019s kept feeling cosy by the walls and ceilings which are the same shade of matt grey throughout. They were done this way, says Alba, so that the rooms not only \u201cbecome circular\u201d and create intimacy but also complement the view of Santa Maria delle Grazie. It brings the outside in \u2013 as do the pots of Monstera deliciosa, along with unidentified succulents and vases of wild eucalyptus. One of the most memorable pieces from Alba\u2019s home is a glass sculpture of a salmon by the glass artist Hugh Findletar, which Alba says he was drawn to \u201cbecause salmon swim against the tide\u201d. In creating this very personal space inside this world-famous landmark, Alba and his family have created a Renaissance of their own.",

      "body": "<p>From Leonardo da Vinci to <em>Iron Man</em>\u2019s Tony Stark, the ultimate ambition of madcap inventors has always been the personal flying machine. Last year, filming in China, TV presenter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/18/reggie-yates-searching-for-grenfell-missing-victims-interview\" title=\"\">Reggie Yates</a> saw that ambition finally realised when a young tech entrepreneur he was interviewing for a documentary climbed on to his drone motorbike and calmly pootled off and up, 50m or so into the sky.</p> <p>Viewers watching the feat will be astounded. But Yates, 36, adopts neither Palinesque awestruck wonderment nor Therouxvian outsider awkwardness. Instead, he turns to the inventor\u2019s wife and asks her how working on the machine has affected their family. Not great, it turns out. They\u2019ve had to sell their home to fund his research and she\u2019s terrified about him having an accident. It\u2019s an unusual conversation: matter-of-fact and personal, not the kind of thing you often see on TV.</p> <p>Yates has two documentary series out this month. The three-part <em>Reggie Yates in China</em>, featuring the drone motorbike, sees him wrestling with the well-trodden contradictions of an authoritarian free-market superpower. Then there\u2019s MTV\u2019s <em>Reggie Yates Meets World</em> (\u201cAlways get your name in the title,\u201d he tells me), which focuses on young people getting rich in unusual ways. But whether he\u2019s hanging out with teen e-sports fanatics in the US or traversing the monoculture of China, he seems to manage a kind of everyman ease with his subjects, making them forget the crew and cameras, as if they\u2019re just talking to a friend they haven\u2019t seen in a while.</p> <p>He creates the same atmosphere when we meet in a caf\u00e9 near his home in southeast London. \u201cHello again!\u201d he beams at our waiter, before reinforcing status as a regular by ordering the veggie breakfast less as if it was a meal and more an ongoing process of trial and error slowly working towards perfection. \u201cNo toast, extra halloumi, a couple more croquettes if anything, and eggs, scrambled, but cooked through, because yesterday they were a bit runny.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c8eb82e1ff6e7ac5f9d8ab87d27d604a8fddd23a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c8eb82e1ff6e7ac5f9d8ab87d27d604a8fddd23a/84_0_2600_1560/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ready for take-off: Reggie Yates in China with Zhao Deli, inventor of the \u2018Magical Cloud\u2019 flying motorbike.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ready for take-off: Reggie Yates in China with Zhao Deli, inventor of the \u2018Magical Cloud\u2019 flying motorbike.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sam Wilkinson/BBC/72 Films</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He asks me five or so questions before I\u2019m able to sneak my first in. I can\u2019t tell if this is him unwilling to relinquish the role of interviewer or just his matey manner, but by the time our drinks arrive he has worked out that he almost attended the same co-ed secondary school as me, but ended up going elsewhere because his mum was worried he\u2019d be distracted by the girls.</p> <p>Yates has had decades to hone this patter. He first appeared on television aged eight, popping up in small roles in <em>A Bit of Fry and Laurie</em> sketches and the groundbreaking C4 sitcom <em>Desmond\u2019s</em>. By the time he was a teenager he was hosting a ream of kids\u2019 Saturday morning shows as well as appearing in CBBC dramas. Often working alongside <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/fearne-cotton\" title=\"\">Fearne Cotton</a>, he quickly made the transition into grown-up broadcasting, hosting all three of the BBC\u2019s tentpole pop shows: <em>The Voice</em>, the official chart on Radio 1, and <em>Top of the Pops</em>.</p> <p>It\u2019s not uncommon for someone with that level of adolescent success to become enamoured of the trappings of fame and to start making reckless choices. But Yates is almost never papped at showbiz parties and claims he has never drunk alcohol or tried any drug. Why is he so sensible? \u201cAt 18, I\u2019d already been on telly for a decade. I had a mortgage and three year-long contracts for Radio 1, <em>Top of the Pops</em> and CBBC, but I\u2019d also had a decade of people recognising me in the street, a decade of my mum telling me, \u2018Don\u2019t mess up or it all goes away.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>He says he could feel the difference between himself and other people his age when he was interviewing pop bands on CBBC. \u201cThey had \u2018rinse me\u2019 written on their foreheads and \u2018take everything you can\u2019 written across their T-shirts.

Just hours after the interview, the group was involved in riots in which the journalist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/lyra-mckee\" title=\"\">Lyra McKee</a> was shot and killed. Some have claimed Saoradh amped up their usual Easter shenanigans to make a bigger splash for the TV crew.

He is currently working on three screenplays, including a feature film.

This morning he went to his barber at 6am \u2013 they opened especially for him \u2013 followed by the gym, the motorbike shop, a meeting with his architect, another with his \u201cA/V guy\u201d and now he\u2019s eating for the first time today.

Even when he\u2019s talking about his single life \u2013 things ended with his fianc\u00e9e, the model Tia Ward, a few years ago \u2013 he\u2019s desperately even-handed. \u201cThe only way you can have a sustained relationship with a romantic partner is that they can\u2019t be your everything.\u201d</p> <p>I wonder if he is always so philosophical about everything. \u201cI used to be very judgmental\u2026 not in a bitchy way, but in a self-righteous way.

They\u2019re everywhere. To keep that in check I ask myself the right questions and as a result I think I\u2019m balanced. I know I am balanced.

      "bodyText": "From Leonardo da Vinci to Iron Man\u2019s Tony Stark, the ultimate ambition of madcap inventors has always been the personal flying machine. Last year, filming in China, TV presenter Reggie Yates saw that ambition finally realised when a young tech entrepreneur he was interviewing for a documentary climbed on to his drone motorbike and calmly pootled off and up, 50m or so into the sky. Viewers watching the feat will be astounded. But Yates, 36, adopts neither Palinesque awestruck wonderment nor Therouxvian outsider awkwardness. Instead, he turns to the inventor\u2019s wife and asks her how working on the machine has affected their family. Not great, it turns out. They\u2019ve had to sell their home to fund his research and she\u2019s terrified about him having an accident. It\u2019s an unusual conversation: matter-of-fact and personal, not the kind of thing you often see on TV. Yates has two documentary series out this month. The three-part Reggie Yates in China, featuring the drone motorbike, sees him wrestling with the well-trodden contradictions of an authoritarian free-market superpower. Then there\u2019s MTV\u2019s Reggie Yates Meets World (\u201cAlways get your name in the title,\u201d he tells me), which focuses on young people getting rich in unusual ways. But whether he\u2019s hanging out with teen e-sports fanatics in the US or traversing the monoculture of China, he seems to manage a kind of everyman ease with his subjects, making them forget the crew and cameras, as if they\u2019re just talking to a friend they haven\u2019t seen in a while. He creates the same atmosphere when we meet in a caf\u00e9 near his home in southeast London. \u201cHello again!\u201d he beams at our waiter, before reinforcing status as a regular by ordering the veggie breakfast less as if it was a meal and more an ongoing process of trial and error slowly working towards perfection. \u201cNo toast, extra halloumi, a couple more croquettes if anything, and eggs, scrambled, but cooked through, because yesterday they were a bit runny.\u201d He asks me five or so questions before I\u2019m able to sneak my first in. I can\u2019t tell if this is him unwilling to relinquish the role of interviewer or just his matey manner, but by the time our drinks arrive he has worked out that he almost attended the same co-ed secondary school as me, but ended up going elsewhere because his mum was worried he\u2019d be distracted by the girls. Yates has had decades to hone this patter. He first appeared on television aged eight, popping up in small roles in A Bit of Fry and Laurie sketches and the groundbreaking C4 sitcom Desmond\u2019s. By the time he was a teenager he was hosting a ream of kids\u2019 Saturday morning shows as well as appearing in CBBC dramas. Often working alongside Fearne Cotton, he quickly made the transition into grown-up broadcasting, hosting all three of the BBC\u2019s tentpole pop shows: The Voice, the official chart on Radio 1, and Top of the Pops. It\u2019s not uncommon for someone with that level of adolescent success to become enamoured of the trappings of fame and to start making reckless choices. But Yates is almost never papped at showbiz parties and claims he has never drunk alcohol or tried any drug. Why is he so sensible? \u201cAt 18, I\u2019d already been on telly for a decade. I had a mortgage and three year-long contracts for Radio 1, Top of the Pops and CBBC, but I\u2019d also had a decade of people recognising me in the street, a decade of my mum telling me, \u2018Don\u2019t mess up or it all goes away.\u2019\u201d He says he could feel the difference between himself and other people his age when he was interviewing pop bands on CBBC. \u201cThey had \u2018rinse me\u2019 written on their foreheads and \u2018take everything you can\u2019 written across their T-shirts. Even at 18, I could see they were ripe for being taken advantage of because it was all so new and exciting; they had too much too soon.\u201d Instead of becoming an It Boy, Yates started to become restless with entertainment TV and began making documentaries. Initially, he wasn\u2019t sure whether he knew enough about current affairs to make factual TV and took some convincing from the then-controller of BBC One, Danny Cohen, but after a series exploring masculinity, homophobia, crime and cults, he now feels at home in the genre. \u201cIt\u2019s never an interview, it\u2019s a conversation, researched to a point, but I can still be surprised in the moment. I feel confident in saying that if I sat down with George Clooney, I could get him to say something he\u2019d never said before.\u201d It wasn\u2019t always that way. \u201cPart of the reason I left Radio 1 is that I would be sat down with pop stars and I\u2019m asking them questions that their label and my producer want me to ask. I\u2019d have One Direction sat in front of me and not be able to ask how much they\u2019re struggling, just about their new song that they didn\u2019t write.\u201d Yates\u2019s own films are informative and, he says, far from formulaic. \u201cBecause of who I am \u2013 a young black man from north London, from a working-class background \u2013 the way I tackle a subject matter is going to be infinitely different from, say, Michael Palin.\u201d Fronting primetime documentary strands on the BBC is the holy grail for most serious broadcasters, Palin included. But when you list them \u2013 Theroux, Palin, Simon Reeve, Stacey Dooley, Brian Cox, Michael Portillo, Andrew Marr \u2013 the lack of diversity is obvious. You\u2019d expect him to say that needs to change, but the absence of people who look like him hosting documentaries punctures him in an especially visceral way. \u201cI realised how alone I was and how awkward that made me feel. Every single time I leave the house, someone stops me and says: \u2018You\u2019ve found your purpose,\u2019 or, \u2018You\u2019re doing this for us,\u2019 and \u2018Thank you for speaking for me,\u2019 or, \u2018You\u2019re like one of my sons.\u2019 You realise you\u2019ve got a platform you\u2019ve got to do something with.\u201d Is he saying that the way people talk to him on the street is different to, say, the way they talk to Fearne Cotton? \u201cThose are your words not mine, but I know I\u2019m in a very different place from my peers. Realistically, I\u2019m peerless.\u201d He does feel a kinship with the rapper Kano, with actor and former So Solid Crew member Ashley Walters and with Ashley Thomas, also known as Bashy, who moved from music to acting. \u201cWe\u2019re having conversations about tax, about health, about looking after ourselves, the pressures of being \u2018the one that made it\u2019, even though none of us feel like we\u2019ve made it. But their experiences are in music and acting. I don\u2019t have anyone to talk to about going from entertainment to documentary to directing.\u201d His answer to this problem has been to take on five mentees, who he\u2019s helping through the hurdles of the TV industry. Two of them, the Asian Network host Mim Shaikh and the stylist and filmmaker Basma Khalifa, have had their debut documentaries shown on BBC One. Both, on Yates\u2019s advice, feature their name in the title. He says he hopes they will surpass his success and \u201csooner rather than later\u201d. Yates is so deeply focused on being a model to others \u2013 he has written his autobiography about his journey and gives advice and talks on YouTube \u2013 that he might seem impervious to scandal, but he has more than once been accused of serious missteps. Three years ago he appeared on the HalfCast podcast with Chuckie and Poet, two stalwarts of the grime scene. He was talking about how exciting it was that there are not just more young black artists, but also that they\u2019re \u201cindependent, they\u2019re not managed by some random fat Jewish guy from northwest London, they\u2019re managed by their brethren\u201d. After being accused by many of antisemitism, he apologised for the remarks and quit that year\u2019s edition of Top of the Pops (he hasn\u2019t returned since). \u201cI was beating myself up more than anybody else, because I was like: \u2018I\u2019m so stupid to say something like that,\u2019 and in the moment not correct myself and not realise the people that I care about I will offend,\u201d he says of that time. \u201cThe greatest lesson I\u2019ve learned from it is that context is irrelevant when you hurt somebody.

It would still have been a bad thing to say if there were a lot of Jews working in that genre, but because there aren\u2019t; it felt as though it was plugged into an older, more sinister stereotype. \u201cYeah, John [Wiley\u2019s manager] is a mate of mine. He spoke about it in a Jewish newspaper, he stuck up for me. He said: \u2018He\u2019s apologised to me personally,\u2019 which I had. Look, I\u2019m not going to run down the list of people in my phonebook who are from that faith, but I had to make a lot of calls, because I personally wanted to apologise to people. And I think the minute you\u2019re smart enough to recognise that, you\u2019re smart enough to know you\u2019ll never make that mistake again.\u201d A few years later, Yates was filming in Northern Ireland with Saoradh, a far-left republican group with ties to the New IRA, for his MTV series. Just hours after the interview, the group was involved in riots in which the journalist Lyra McKee was shot and killed. Some have claimed Saoradh amped up their usual Easter shenanigans to make a bigger splash for the TV crew. One community organiser told the Guardian, \u201cThey staged the whole thing for him. It was all staged, all choreographed.\u201d Yates is more reticent on this issue, citing an ongoing police investigation and McKee\u2019s grieving family, but does say that he \u201cabsolutely\u201d feels comfortable with his actions and those of the crew, and points to numerous statements from the Police Service of Northern Ireland that have said there is \u201cno evidence\u201d to suggest their presence affected events on the ground. Neither episode, nor the moment in 2017 when the BBC apologised for \u201cmisleading\u201d scenes in a documentary Yates presented about an Aboriginal community in regional Australia, has put any dampers on Yates\u2019s career. He is currently working on three screenplays, including a feature film. Yesterday, he began his day on a panel about diversity with Esther Rantzen in London, got a car to Oxfordshire to interview Kano, then took a helicopter back to London for a workshop about storytelling organised by Apple. This morning he went to his barber at 6am \u2013 they opened especially for him \u2013 followed by the gym, the motorbike shop, a meeting with his architect, another with his \u201cA/V guy\u201d and now he\u2019s eating for the first time today. Our lunch will be squeezed in before his new car gets delivered, then he\u2019s set a few hours aside to work on his screenplay, before DJing this evening. Meanwhile, he\u2019s designed most of the furniture in his home and most of the jewellery he\u2019s wearing. He goes to the cinema twice a week, is up to speed on the latest music releases and works out almost every morning. Does he have extra hours in the day? \u201cHa, no; if you care enough, you make the time for it.\u201d It helps that he only sleeps five hours a night during the week and goes everywhere by motorbike. \u201cYou\u2019re always going to get there 50% faster.\u201d One might think that his bulging iCal means he would disappear the second I turn my Dictaphone off, but he stays for ages, talking more about the antisemitism issue, about other celebrities who\u2019ve doubled-down, rather than immediately apologising following a racist comment, and have found it career-ending. Even when he\u2019s talking about his single life \u2013 things ended with his fianc\u00e9e, the model Tia Ward, a few years ago \u2013 he\u2019s desperately even-handed. \u201cThe only way you can have a sustained relationship with a romantic partner is that they can\u2019t be your everything.\u201d I wonder if he is always so philosophical about everything. \u201cI used to be very judgmental\u2026 not in a bitchy way, but in a self-righteous way. Therapy helps you assess your behaviour. It\u2019s so easy to become a sycophant or an egomaniac or a psychopath. Jesus Christ, I\u2019ve met some psychopaths in this industry. They\u2019re everywhere. To keep that in check I ask myself the right questions and as a result I think I\u2019m balanced. I know I am balanced. That\u2019s something I\u2019m happy to brag about.\u201d Reggie Yates in China will air this autumn on BBC Two Fashion editor Helen Seamons; grooming by Hannah Cutts; lighting by Michael Furlonger; digital by Rob Self; lighting assistant Alex Williams; fashion assistant Peter Bevan; shot on location at UCL (ucl.ac.uk)",

      "body": "<p>The US troop withdrawal from Syria, the betrayal of the west\u2019s Kurdish allies, and subsequent advances by Russian, Iranian and Syrian regime forces have been widely interpreted as a dramatic \u201cwatershed moment\u201d both for the Middle East and for American global influence.</p> <p>Excited analysts claimed that last week\u2019s Syrian upheaval<a href=\"https://thehill.com/opinion/international/465794-the-beginning-of-the-end-of-a-us-role-in-the-middle-east\" title=\"\"> foreshadowed an end to US regional leadership</a>, even to Washington\u2019s international dominance. A commentator for The Hill<em>,</em> a website reporting on American politics, compared the withdrawal to another famous turning point \u2013 Britain\u2019s \u201ceast of Suez\u201d retreat in 1968.</p> <p>Syrian developments were also taken by some observers as proof that an increasingly <a href=\"https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/decline-is-a-choice/\" title=\"\">isolationist America is turning in on itself </a>and giving way \u2013 as failing empires inevitably do \u2013 to a successor world order shaped by emerging global powers, principally China.</p> <p>But is the Syrian crisis really a watershed moment? And if it is, who are the contenders for America\u2019s crown as no 1 global superpower \u2013 and what are their own strengths and weaknesses?</p> <p>The perception of gradual, broad US international disengagement is widely held. But as historians know, it is hard to tell exactly when a specific, definitive turning point is reached. Contemporary observers, caught up in fast-moving events, are often the least qualified to do so.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The Syrian upheaval provides evidence that the global balance of power is shifting in ways that are not yet understood.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Identifying such transformative tipping points can still be problematic hundreds of years later. Asked about the significance of the 1789 French revolution, Zhou Enlai, the former Chinese Communist party leader, reportedly quipped: \u201cIt\u2019s too soon to say.\u201d Permanent changes in the strategic and geopolitical balance of power rarely come out of the blue. With hindsight, such shifts are frequently seen as the long-signalled culmination of preceding policy decisions, unconnected political and military moves, mishaps and miscalculations.</p> <p>By general agreement, 1945 was a watershed year, marking the final defeat of fascism and the creation, through the UN, of what is known as the \u201crules-based international order\u201d. In much the same way, 1989 is seen, in the US at least, as the year when the west <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/did-the-end-of-the-cold-war-sow-the-seeds-for-a-new-one-1.2019039\" title=\"\">\u201cwon\u201d the cold war with the Soviet Union</a>.</p> <p>Yet it can be argued (as Russians do) that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jun/03/stalingrad-by-vasily-grossman-review\" title=\"\">battle of Stalingrad</a>, which concluded in 1943 with a decisive Red Army victory over the invading Nazis, was the true turning point of the second world war. Likewise, some say the cold war merely paused in 1989, only to resume a decade later in a different guise.</p> <p>Looking back in time, the true significance of other big moments, trumpeted as critical turning points when they occurred, appears similarly open to question. For example, Britain\u2019s post-imperial \u201ceast of Suez\u201d retreat was initially triggered by India\u2019s independence in 1947. By 1968, it was already long under way.</p> <p>In 1992, the <a href=\"https://www.theparliamentmagazine.eu/articles/opinion/maastricht-treaty-25-years\" title=\"\">Maastricht treaty</a> creating the European Union was cheered, and condemned, as opening the door to a federal Europe \u2013 an aspiration unfulfilled more than a quarter of a century later. Tony Blair\u2019s New Labour landslide in 1997 was hailed as a bright new dawn, but quickly clouded over. In the Middle East, the \u201chistoric\u201d 2011 Arab spring pro-democracy revolts, source of much instantaneous hope and joy, proved to be a cruelly deceptive mirage \u2013 precursors of a new epoch of intensifying, region-wide conflict and repression, typified by Syria.</p> <p>The early rebel failure to topple Bashar al-Assad, Syria\u2019s president, when combined with Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 pledge to end US involvement in \u201cendless\u201d foreign wars\u201d and age-old Turkish-Kurdish enmity, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/18/bernard-henri-levy-trumps-syria-withdrawal-is-a-nightmare-and-completely-predictable]\" title=\"\">arguably predetermined events that led predictably</a>, if not inevitably, to last week\u2019s ultimate strategic crunch.</p> <p>Nor do the Syrian regime\u2019s advances represent a sudden, unexpected twist. Assad has been steadily re-establishing control over the main populated areas in recent years. Neighbouring Arab leaders have been mending fences in the belief that Assad has won the war. European governments mostly share this view, though they do not say so publicly.</p> <p>The bigger claim \u2013 that the latest developments amount to a pivotal moment for expanding Russian influence in the Middle East \u2013 is also contentious. Since intervening in Syria in 2015, Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin, has ably exploited ambivalent and confused US policies. While Trump has recklessly stoked confrontation with Iran, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-10-08/putin-s-has-made-russia-part-of-the-middle-east\" title=\"\">Putin has cautiously cultivated cordial working relationships</a> with the main regional actors and adversaries, including Israel, Iran, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Egypt, based on shared interests in counter-terrorism, arms sales, and oil and gas production.</p> <p>In other words, Russia\u2019s influence across the Middle East has been growing for some time. That is partly the result of US strategic incoherence, partly of Putin\u2019s diplomatic acuity. Russia\u2019s latest success in Syria follows this trend. While it\u2019s significant, it probably does not amount, by itself, to a \u201cwatershed moment\u201d.

Yet if this is indeed happening, the change began not with Trump but as far back as the 1989-93 presidency of George HW Bush.</p> <p>By declaring victory in the cold war and promising a domestic <a href=\"https://prospect.org/culture/books/lost-peace-dividend/\" title=\"\">peace dividend</a> paid through reduced military spending, Bush helped nurture a delusional mindset that believed US global hegemony and the newly found status of the US as sole superpower were forever set in stone. The idea gained ground that America could, and should, do exactly as it pleased. Such complacent thinking was given superficial intellectual weight by Francis Fukuyama\u2019s much-mangled thesis, <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/09/03/francis-fukuyama-postpones-the-end-of-history\" title=\"\">The End of History?</a>, first published as an essay in 1989. Part of its attraction lay in its connections to the original isolationist, unilateralist \u201cAmerica First\u201d era that died a sudden death at Pearl Harbor in 1941. </p> <p>The illusion that the US could stand apart, and stand above, the world was shattered for a second time on 11 September 2001. But since then, unlike in the post-1945 period, US foreign policy and war-making have been essentially defensive, self-interested and reactive in nature. The proactive, exemplary global vision of democracy, prosperity and freedom, delivered to the world from a \u201cshining city upon a hill\u201d, as Ronald Reagan put it in 1989, has been obscured. With its perspectives and instincts fatally distorted by the \u201cwar on terror\u201d, America has lost its sense of mission. <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/10/09/trump-cuts-millions-dollars-foreign-aid-iraq-china/\" title=\"\">Swingeing cuts </a>to foreign aid budgets, hostility to the UN and multilateralism in general, and an ideologically driven, post-Iraq aversion to \u201cnation-building\u201d, symbolise this change.</p> <p>In this respect, Trump is but the crude, know-nothing legatee of a regressive process long in the making. Relative US economic decline arising from globalisation, deindustrialisation and increased competition for resources and markets have helped narrow US horizons. Trump\u2019s dislike of costly \u201cforeign entanglements\u201d such as Syria oddly echoes the Founding Fathers and White House predecessors such as James Monroe. All the same, he is a modern aberration whose vow to \u201cmake America great again\u201d is having the opposite effect.</p> <p>The US still leads, mostly, in key areas such as digital, cyber, AI, medical science, tech innovation and space exploration. Its wealth is unmatched. It recently became the <a href=\"https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/US-Is-Now-Largest-Oil-And-Gas-Producer-In-The-World.htm\" title=\"\">top global producer of oil and gas</a>. And it remains the foremost military power. It is said that Trumpism has permanently changed America\u2019s outlook. That may be true but it\u2019s a fair bet that his successors, whoever they are, will try to halt America\u2019s retreat. Future presidents will not cede global leadership to others, as he has done, and may move aggressively to restore America\u2019s reputation and leading role in the 21st century world.</p> <h2>Europe: down for the count</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5da9272a9da00d6ceb04a55b4221334c97e08cc7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5da9272a9da00d6ceb04a55b4221334c97e08cc7/0_128_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"French president Emmanuel Macron with German chancellor Angela Merkel.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">French president Emmanuel Macron with German chancellor Angela Merkel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: R\u00e9gis Duvignau/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The European Union is good at values: it stands for individual human and civil rights, inclusive democratic governance, equality of opportunity and multilateralism \u2013 meaning a collective, collaborative approach to global problems such as the climate crisis and migration.</p> <p>Many of these values, promulgated by 18th-century Enlightenment thinkers, were enshrined in the US constitution, and bind the Old World to the New.

      "bodyText": "The US troop withdrawal from Syria, the betrayal of the west\u2019s Kurdish allies, and subsequent advances by Russian, Iranian and Syrian regime forces have been widely interpreted as a dramatic \u201cwatershed moment\u201d both for the Middle East and for American global influence. Excited analysts claimed that last week\u2019s Syrian upheaval foreshadowed an end to US regional leadership, even to Washington\u2019s international dominance. A commentator for The Hill, a website reporting on American politics, compared the withdrawal to another famous turning point \u2013 Britain\u2019s \u201ceast of Suez\u201d retreat in 1968. Syrian developments were also taken by some observers as proof that an increasingly isolationist America is turning in on itself and giving way \u2013 as failing empires inevitably do \u2013 to a successor world order shaped by emerging global powers, principally China. But is the Syrian crisis really a watershed moment? And if it is, who are the contenders for America\u2019s crown as no 1 global superpower \u2013 and what are their own strengths and weaknesses? The perception of gradual, broad US international disengagement is widely held. But as historians know, it is hard to tell exactly when a specific, definitive turning point is reached. Contemporary observers, caught up in fast-moving events, are often the least qualified to do so. Identifying such transformative tipping points can still be problematic hundreds of years later. Asked about the significance of the 1789 French revolution, Zhou Enlai, the former Chinese Communist party leader, reportedly quipped: \u201cIt\u2019s too soon to say.\u201d Permanent changes in the strategic and geopolitical balance of power rarely come out of the blue. With hindsight, such shifts are frequently seen as the long-signalled culmination of preceding policy decisions, unconnected political and military moves, mishaps and miscalculations. By general agreement, 1945 was a watershed year, marking the final defeat of fascism and the creation, through the UN, of what is known as the \u201crules-based international order\u201d. In much the same way, 1989 is seen, in the US at least, as the year when the west \u201cwon\u201d the cold war with the Soviet Union. Yet it can be argued (as Russians do) that the battle of Stalingrad, which concluded in 1943 with a decisive Red Army victory over the invading Nazis, was the true turning point of the second world war. Likewise, some say the cold war merely paused in 1989, only to resume a decade later in a different guise. Looking back in time, the true significance of other big moments, trumpeted as critical turning points when they occurred, appears similarly open to question. For example, Britain\u2019s post-imperial \u201ceast of Suez\u201d retreat was initially triggered by India\u2019s independence in 1947. By 1968, it was already long under way. In 1992, the Maastricht treaty creating the European Union was cheered, and condemned, as opening the door to a federal Europe \u2013 an aspiration unfulfilled more than a quarter of a century later. Tony Blair\u2019s New Labour landslide in 1997 was hailed as a bright new dawn, but quickly clouded over. In the Middle East, the \u201chistoric\u201d 2011 Arab spring pro-democracy revolts, source of much instantaneous hope and joy, proved to be a cruelly deceptive mirage \u2013 precursors of a new epoch of intensifying, region-wide conflict and repression, typified by Syria. The early rebel failure to topple Bashar al-Assad, Syria\u2019s president, when combined with Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 pledge to end US involvement in \u201cendless\u201d foreign wars\u201d and age-old Turkish-Kurdish enmity, arguably predetermined events that led predictably, if not inevitably, to last week\u2019s ultimate strategic crunch. Nor do the Syrian regime\u2019s advances represent a sudden, unexpected twist. Assad has been steadily re-establishing control over the main populated areas in recent years. Neighbouring Arab leaders have been mending fences in the belief that Assad has won the war. European governments mostly share this view, though they do not say so publicly. The bigger claim \u2013 that the latest developments amount to a pivotal moment for expanding Russian influence in the Middle East \u2013 is also contentious. Since intervening in Syria in 2015, Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin, has ably exploited ambivalent and confused US policies. While Trump has recklessly stoked confrontation with Iran, Putin has cautiously cultivated cordial working relationships with the main regional actors and adversaries, including Israel, Iran, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Egypt, based on shared interests in counter-terrorism, arms sales, and oil and gas production. In other words, Russia\u2019s influence across the Middle East has been growing for some time. That is partly the result of US strategic incoherence, partly of Putin\u2019s diplomatic acuity. Russia\u2019s latest success in Syria follows this trend. While it\u2019s significant, it probably does not amount, by itself, to a \u201cwatershed moment\u201d. What the Syrian upheaval does do, however, is provide additional, confirmatory evidence that the global balance of power is slowly and incrementally shifting in ways that are not yet fully understood and with consequences not yet glimpsed. This process resembles not so much a sudden earthquake as a long-drawn-out series of tremors and shocks. And while it\u2019s clear that the grip of the old, post-1945 US-dominated international order is weakening, it is unclear what will replace it \u2013 and who will come out on top. The main global contenders \u2013 the US, China, Russia and Europe and their respective allies, dependents and satraps \u2013 remain the same. But the relative ability, and desire, of each power bloc to shape and lead the 21st century by outmanoeuvring and outperforming rivals may be fundamentally changing. Whether last week was a watershed moment or not, it\u2019s plain that the new world order is coming up for grabs. The US: defending champion on the ropes Although the US remains, by most measures, the world\u2019s most influential and powerful country, the advent of Donald Trump has encouraged talk of an end to its global dominance. Yet if this is indeed happening, the change began not with Trump but as far back as the 1989-93 presidency of George HW Bush. By declaring victory in the cold war and promising a domestic peace dividend paid through reduced military spending, Bush helped nurture a delusional mindset that believed US global hegemony and the newly found status of the US as sole superpower were forever set in stone. The idea gained ground that America could, and should, do exactly as it pleased. Such complacent thinking was given superficial intellectual weight by Francis Fukuyama\u2019s much-mangled thesis, The End of History?, first published as an essay in 1989. Part of its attraction lay in its connections to the original isolationist, unilateralist \u201cAmerica First\u201d era that died a sudden death at Pearl Harbor in 1941. The illusion that the US could stand apart, and stand above, the world was shattered for a second time on 11 September 2001. But since then, unlike in the post-1945 period, US foreign policy and war-making have been essentially defensive, self-interested and reactive in nature. The proactive, exemplary global vision of democracy, prosperity and freedom, delivered to the world from a \u201cshining city upon a hill\u201d, as Ronald Reagan put it in 1989, has been obscured. With its perspectives and instincts fatally distorted by the \u201cwar on terror\u201d, America has lost its sense of mission. Swingeing cuts to foreign aid budgets, hostility to the UN and multilateralism in general, and an ideologically driven, post-Iraq aversion to \u201cnation-building\u201d, symbolise this change. In this respect, Trump is but the crude, know-nothing legatee of a regressive process long in the making. Relative US economic decline arising from globalisation, deindustrialisation and increased competition for resources and markets have helped narrow US horizons. Trump\u2019s dislike of costly \u201cforeign entanglements\u201d such as Syria oddly echoes the Founding Fathers and White House predecessors such as James Monroe. All the same, he is a modern aberration whose vow to \u201cmake America great again\u201d is having the opposite effect. The US still leads, mostly, in key areas such as digital, cyber, AI, medical science, tech innovation and space exploration. Its wealth is unmatched. It recently became the top global producer of oil and gas. And it remains the foremost military power. It is said that Trumpism has permanently changed America\u2019s outlook. That may be true but it\u2019s a fair bet that his successors, whoever they are, will try to halt America\u2019s retreat. Future presidents will not cede global leadership to others, as he has done, and may move aggressively to restore America\u2019s reputation and leading role in the 21st century world. Europe: down for the count The European Union is good at values: it stands for individual human and civil rights, inclusive democratic governance, equality of opportunity and multilateralism \u2013 meaning a collective, collaborative approach to global problems such as the climate crisis and migration. Many of these values, promulgated by 18th-century Enlightenment thinkers, were enshrined in the US constitution, and bind the Old World to the New. Europe and the US appear natural partners. Yet the story of recent years is one of growing division and rivalry. There have been damaging splits and rows over issues such as the Iraq war, trade protectionism, the importance of international institutions such as the United Nations, the future of Nato, transnational justice, health and food standards, and environmental policy. The EU is divided from within, too, over the way the eurozone operates, budget fairness and French-led plans for a more integrated, federal Europe. There are also east-west and north-south splits, dramatised by the rise of hard-right populists in Italy and by Poland\u2019s and Hungary\u2019s governance disputes with Brussels. Recent polling suggests most people in most member countries support the EU, but there are wide divergences over what it is for and what it should do. Voters believe that Europe carries more clout in the world if it acts in unison. But that often proves difficult. Last week saw the EU split over a proposed arms embargo on Turkey. Meanwhile, Britain\u2019s defection prospectively weakens its ability to influence events. EU enthusiasts argue that the bloc should do more to boost Europe\u2019s standing as a key player on the world stage. But even if all its divisions were somehow magically healed, the idea that the EU may one day be in a position to challenge American or Chinese global leadership still seems far-fetched. Russia: punching above its weight Given the chaotic post-communist legacy bequeathed by Boris Yeltsin, Vladimir Putin, Russia\u2019s president, has made the best of a bad job. The former KGB spy once bemoaned the collapse of the Soviet empire as the \u201cgreatest geopolitical catastrophe\u201d of the last century. In contrast, Russia in the 21st century punches above its weight. Yet Putin\u2019s diplomatic, military and strategic successes, notably in the Middle East, cannot disguise fundamental domestic weaknesses: chronic underinvestment, overreliance on energy export revenues, poor infrastructure and social provision, endemic corruption, rising political discontent, and a pervasive, fearful sense of state lawlessness. Putin has largely defined his foreign policy in disruptive opposition to the US and the EU \u2013 by slavishly befriending China, courting Eurosceptic east Europeans, meddling in the Balkans, backing outlier regimes such as Iran, selling arms to anybody who asks, manipulating other people\u2019s elections (and his own), and generally subverting democratic states. But as a plausible alternative to either the US or China in terms of global leadership, Russia is outmatched and outclassed. Putin lacks a positive, constructive vision for his own country, let alone the world \u2013 and, opposition leader Alexei Navalny apart, there is no sign yet of a Russian leader who has one. China: boxing clever Xi Jinping, China\u2019s president, makes no secret of his ambition to restore the Middle Kingdom to its once unchallenged leadership position at the centre of international events. His oddly named Belt &amp; Road Initiative, involving infrastructure development and capital investment in more than 150 countries, is probably the most rapidly expansionist global strategy ever devised by a single state. In previous eras, Britain and other imperial powers used superior military might, physical control of territory, and divide-and-rule tactics to project their national interests around the globe. Xi\u2019s empire-building is less adversarial, primarily economic and financial in nature. China calls it a win-win strategy. Critics call it ruthless debt diplomacy.

Large Chinese companies such as Huawei, ultimately subject to state control, are successfully challenging equivalent American and European businesses in growth areas such as telecoms and nuclear power. China\u2019s military capabilities are growing rapidly, too, notably its \u201cblue water\u201d naval surface and submarine fleet whose evident aim is to challenge American control in the western Pacific. This looks certain to increase tensions with western powers around flashpoints such as Taiwan and disputed areas of the South China Sea. Xi\u2019s China also offers the world an alternative governance model \u2013 an authoritarian, paternalistic system, reinforced by mass surveillance, that ostensibly guarantees the wellbeing and safety of citizens in return for their political acquiescence and public silence. This model is plainly not working in Hong Kong and Xinjiang. As China\u2019s middle class grows, it may not work much longer in mainland cities, either. China\u2019s dramatic economic growth has slowed. While this may be temporary, the Communist party\u2019s lack of democratic legitimacy and the absence of consent pose the biggest long-term threat to China\u2019s 21st-century global ambitions.

He studied at&nbsp;Eton and then Trinity College, Cambridge, and first became a Conservative MP in 1997.</p>\n    <p>However, his political career had started long before then, as he had served in Margaret Thatcher's policy unit from 1983 to 1986. The poll tax was an idea Letwin almost single-handedly kept alive in the mid-1980s. In a 1985 memo, he suggested it could be introduced in Scotland first as \u201ca trailblazer for the real thing\u201d.</p>\n    <p>In 2016 Letwin was forced to apologise after it emerged he had co-written a paper telling Thatcher that providing financial assistance for black unemployed youth after the 1985 riots would only end up in the \u201cdisco and drug trade\u201d. The memo, Letwin admitted, was \u201cbadly worded and wrong\u201d.</p>\n    <p>Letwin was forced into hiding in 2001 by a desperate Conservative party, after being outed as the minister who had&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/may/21/uk.election200115\">promis</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/may/21/uk.election200115\">ed \u00a320bn of tax and spending cuts</a>&nbsp;in an anonymous interview with the Financial Times, far beyond the party\u2019s manifesto at the time.</p>\n    <p>In many respects, the best periods of Letwin\u2019s career were in the policy engine room, not least when he acted as David Cameron\u2019s fixer, when he was a cabinet office minister in the coalition government. His influence went far beyond the ministerial title.</p>\n    <p>Then he wrestled with issues such as the future of press regulation in the aftermath of the Leveson inquiry. Letwin\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/dec/20/oliver-letwin-leveson-reforms\">big idea</a>, to deal with the fact that newspapers refused to accept statutory regulation, was to create an independent regulator backed by royal charter. It was neat, but the mainstream press refused to accept it.</p>\n    <p>Letwin has emerged as an unlikely Brexit rebel, going from being the ultimate loyalist to serial rebel, beginning in January 2019 when he voted with Labour to give Theresa May a two-week deadline to debate Brexit next steps if her deal was voted down.</p>\n    <p>\u201cMy right honourable friend&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?p=10555\">Sir Nicholas Soames</a>, who is sitting next to me, and I have calculated that we have been in the house, collectively, for 56 years, and we have only ever, either of us, voted once against the Conservative whip,\u201d Letwin said.</p>\n    <p>A month later his concerns had hardened, as demonstrated in a Commons speech in which he worried that \u201cwhen the chips are down\u201d the government \u201cwould prefer to do what some of my esteemed colleagues would prefer to do: head for the exit door without a deal\u201d. It was, he added, \u201ca terrifying fact\u201d \u2013 and one he resolved to prevent.</p>\n    <p>Ultimately it was to cost him his place in the Conservative party, as Prime Minister Boris Johnson removed the whip from 21 Tory rebels including Letwin, as his Brexit plans were thwarted yet again.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Dan Sabbagh</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The amendment has the backing of Labour: however, it has been heavily criticised for denying Johnson a conclusive vote on his deal.</p> \n<p>Other people to put their name to the amendment were Labour\u2019s Hilary Benn, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, Jo Swinson, and the former Tory chancellor Philip Hammond.</p> \n<p>If the government loses on the Letwin amendment, it is expected to boycott the rest of the day\u2019s proceedings, and press ahead with tabling the withdrawal agreement bill \u2013 the legislation needed to enact Brexit.</p> \n<p>There could then be a vote on the second reading of the bill on Tuesday \u2013 which government sources suggested could effectively become the \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d denied to Johnson on Saturday.</p> \n<h2>Boris Johnson\u2019s deal</h2> \n<p>If the Letwin amendment has not passed, MPs will then move on to vote for or against the prime minister\u2019s Brexit deal.

Kevin Brock never kicked a ball for Everton, but he played one of the most important passes in their history. Brock\u2019s poor backpass, which allowed Adrian Heath to score a late equaliser against Oxford in a Milk Cup quarter-final in January 1984, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/that-1980s-sports-blog/2015/oct/20/howard-kendall-everton-fa-cup-1984\">probably saved Howard Kendall from the sack</a>. Fifteen months later, Everton were the best side in England, having stormed to the title with a record five games to spare, and possibly Europe.</p> <p>Marco Silva could do with a Kevin Brock moment right now. He is fighting for his job, with Everton third from bottom and on a run of four straight defeats. Another against West Ham today might be his last. Everton have been a bit unfortunate at times, and they were excellent against Manchester City in their last home game, but the modern culture of instant gratification will not tolerate a club of Everton\u2019s size being in the bottom three. </p> <p>Ronald Koeman was sacked two years ago this weekend, after a 5-2 defeat at home to Arsenal left them in the relegation places. Koeman also had a promising first season and an unfathomably poor start to the second. Silva will hope the comparison ends there. </p> <p><strong>Kick off is at 12.30pm</strong>.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-19T11:14:28.742Z\">at 12.14pm BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "I\u2019ll leave you with our match report from Goodison. Thanks for your company - bye! There are seven 3pm fixtures in the Premier League. Tom Bassam has team news from around the country. Post-match reaction Gylfi Sigurdsson \u201cIt was a fantastic performance. It was one of those games where we had a lot of chances, so you never know when it\u2019s only 1-0, but luckily we managed to hold on to the three points. We had a lot of energy andthere was a real purpose to our game today. We pressed them high; we passed the ball really well with good movement. Theo Walcott \u201cThe guys were fantastic from start to finish. The international break can be difficult but we worked hard and the team showed how strong we actually are going forward. We don\u2019t want to get ahead of ourselves but we know the quality of the team. The fans were fantastic. There was a sense of urgency in our game today and everyone enjoyed it.\u201d It\u2019s safe to say Marco Silva hasn\u2019t lost the dressing-room. That was a superb performance, with a blistering intensity throughout. There was plenty of quality, too; Theo Walcott, Richarlison and Andre Gomes were especially good, while the substitute Gylfi Sigurdsson scored a spectacular late goal to settle the match. Peep peep! Everton jump up to 12th with a rousing, emphatic victory over West Ham. That was a classic Sigurdsson goal. He received a square pass from Richarlison 25 yards from goal and sat Wilshere down by dummying to shoot with his left foot. Then he came back onto his right foot, looked up and whipped a beautiful rising curler that flew into the net. It brushed the fingers of Roberto, who was at full stretch, but he was never saving that. The substitute Gylfi Sigurdsson seals victory with a glorious goal! 90+1 min There will be four minutes of added time. Pickford makes a smart save from Ajeti, who had been flagged offside. That would have been tight had it gone to VAR. 90 min \u201cEven I am currently higher than Man Utd,\u201d sniffs Ian Copestake. 89 min Rice abandons his station to surge into the Everton area, but Mina comes across to shepherd the ball through to Pickford. Good defending. 89 min \u201cShouldn\u2019t the referee wait for the ball to go out of play in order to blow the whistle?\u201d says Miltos Kal. \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of VAR if the referee stops the attack and it can\u2019t be reviewed?\u201d I have no idea any more. There are so many inconsistencies and imperfections. 88 min Sigurdsson gets involved straight away, warming Roberto\u2019s right hand from 20 yards. 87 min Gylfi Sigurdsson replaces Alex Iwobi, who has had a good game apart from that missed chance a few moments ago. 85 min Everton make a change: Moise Kean on, Theo Walcott off. He\u2019s been outstanding. 83 min West Ham are given a corner despite a clear hack by Masuaku on Sidibe. I\u2019m not sure Sidibe touched the ball either. The corner leads to a goalmouth scramble and eventually a brilliant save from Pickford to repel Ogbonna\u2019s deflected close-range shot. There would have been mayhem had that gone in. 82 min Everton have been great today; a 3-0 scoreline wouldn\u2019t flatter them. 81 min Walcott plays a give-and-go with Iwobi and fizzes a cross to the near post. Diop gets in a tangle and unwittingly rams the ball towards his own goal; it flies off the head of Roberto, who had no time to react, and over the bar. 79 min Diop is booked for a foul on Richarlison. I think that Mina goal was disallowed because Andre Gomes blocked Diop, but it looked a very harsh decision. There was no pause for a VAR check, so goodness knows. 78 min: Mina has a goal disallowed! It was an empathic header from Bernard\u2019s right-wing corner, but Paul Tierney had blown for a foul. I\u2019m not exactly sure what that was for. 77 min: Iwobi misses a glorious chance! That should have been the match for Everton. Sidibe charged down the inside-right channel, waited for Richarlison to drag defenders out of the way and then played a fine pass towards Iwobi in space down the middle. His first touch was immaculate, dragging the ball away from Diop on the run, but he stabbed his shot far close to Roberto. 76 min \u201cIs it just me,\u201d says Ian Copestake, \u201cor has this game been going on for hours?\u201d Well you might think that but I couldn\u2019t possibly comment. 74 min West Ham make their final change, and switch to a 4-4-2 formation: Mark Noble is replaced by the young Swiss striker Albian Ajeti. 73 min It\u2019s a much tighter game in the second half, though Everton still look the likelier scorers. Andre Gomes plays a delightful pass inside Fredericks for Digne, whose low cross towards Richarlison deflects through to the keeper Roberto. 71 min \u201cGood to see a report written partly in Old English,\u201d says Charles Antaki. \u201cThe phrase \u2018the superb Walcott\u2019 dates back to c. 2007-8 AD but was thought to have fallen into disuse somewhere around 2012. Fondly remembered, if now largely obsolete.\u201d Wait until Jack Wilshere equalises. Then you\u2019ll really see some Chaucer. 70 min Declan Rice is booked for a foul on Walcott, who has been the best player on the pitch. On which subject... 68 min The Premier League is so tight that a win would lift Everton from 18th to 12th, above Manchster United and only a point behind Spurs. 67 min Yarmolenko\u2019s free-kick is comfortably saved by Pickford, moving smartly across his line. 64 min: Walcott hits the bar! That was a ferocious strike. Digne\u2019s free-kick from the left was headed out to him, 25 yards from goal, by Ogbonna. He controlled the ball with his chest and then, as it bounced up, lashed a beautiful shot that flashed past the diving Roberto all ends up and rebounded off the underside of the bar. 63 min Another West Ham substitution. Jack Wilshere replaces Pablo Fornals, who has had a minor stinker. 63 min \u201cWest Ham are overrated,\u201d says Clive Smith. \u201cTheir displays this season have not been that good. The manager plays one forward home and away. The defence is one of the worst in the league. I have supported this team over seventy years. Nothing changes. As long as they stay in the Premiership that\u2019s ok. They have not won anything for nearly forty years and never will.\u201d I sense a certain apathy towards the 1999 Intertoto Cup. 62 min Roberto makes a comfortable save from Mina\u2019s header. 61 min This has been a stirring performance from Everton, who have played with the kind of intensity that the home fans love. 59 min Digne whistles a free-kick just wide from a tight angle on the right. 56 min West Ham have been slightly better in attack since the break, with Fornals seeing a lot of the ball. He\u2019s done bugger all with it, but it\u2019s the taking part that counts. 53 min The superb Walcott wins a corner for Everton. Digne curls it towards the far post, where Mina\u2019s downward header is saved comfortably by Roberto. 51 min West Ham\u2019s best chance. Yarmolenko\u2019s cross from the right bounces nicely into the path of Fornals, who mishits a first-time shot wide of the far post from 15 yards. 48 min \u201cYou should have a butchers at the match thread in r/Hammers on reddit,\u201d says Mark Lepine. \u201cTo say, \u2018West Ham have been poor\u2019 is an understatement in there.\u201d The internet: the worst thing to happen to society since [blank]. 47 min Richarlison goes down holding his face after wearing the point of Diop\u2019s elbow. It was accidental. 46 min: Richarlison has a goal disallowed for offside! It was the right decision, as he was well off; it was also a superb volleyed finish from Richarlison. 46 min Peep peep! West Ham have brought on Andriy Yarmolenko, which isn\u2019t a surprise, and taken off Felipe Anderson, which is. Peep peep! Everton deservedly lead through Bernard\u2019s unlikely goal, a reward for persistence and improvisation. The rejigged side, with Richarlison up front, have looked sharp on the counter-attack and could be further ahead. West Ham, who omitted Andriy Yarmolenko, have been poor. 45+3 min Tom Davies is booked for something or other. 45 min There will be three minutes of added time. 44 min \u201cIt seems to me that Marco Silva might be another managerial victim of Olivier Giroud\u2019s failed transfer to Everton,\u201d says Admir Pajic. \u201cNeither Calvert-Lewin nor Kean are what Everton need right now. Given that, today\u2019s front line of four wingers capable of interchanging positions might be the last straw for Silva. As an Arsenal fan, I still recall how some of the finest Arsenal display\u2019s in the last years of Wenger\u2019s career - including 5-2 at Leicester, 3-0 over Man U and 3-0 over Chelsea - were made possible by Theo Walcott starting in a No.9 role or on the right wing with a mobile striker (Alexis) down the middle. Of course, he will never have qualities of a classic No.9 like Giroud but he still has pace and is a calm finisher.\u201d 42 min Felipe Anderson gets away from Mina, but then underhits his a cross/pass towards the unmarked Haller. 40 min Richarlison\u2019s shot from the edge of the area is blocked, and Walcott scissor-kicks the loose ball wide. Richarlison had the best chance; he should have played in the overlapping Sidibe to his right. 38 min Walcott\u2019s speculative, backheeled cross-shot is blocked by Masuaku. Walcott has been superb today, with an without the ball. 38 min Nothing much happening at the moment. West Ham have offered very little in attack. 33 min Pickford makes a comfortable diving save from Fornals\u2019 header. I think it would have been disallowed for offside anyway. 32 min Play resumes. 31 min \u201cWith regards to your confusion about Ian\u2019s son\u2026\u201d begins James Chambers. \u201cEveryone knows that BA ain\u2019t getting\u2019 on no plane, you crazy fool\u2026 I\u2019d go with Toy Story 4.\u201d Crikey, a shock scoreline: Pixar 1-0 Napoli. 30 min There\u2019s a break in play with Masuaku is treated for a bloody nose. He collided with Tom Davies. 27 min \u201cBernard is going to be good playing for Merseyside in the traditional Christmas five-a-side tournament at Earl\u2019s Court,\u201d says Gary Naylor. You say that like it\u2019s a \u2026 hang on, is it a good thing? 24 min Iwobi\u2019s long-range shot is held by Roberto. West Ham are being overrun at the moment. 22 min: Richarlison hits the post! That was really nice football from, Everton. Iwobi played him in with a lovely through pass down the side of the defence. Richarlison got between the centre backs and drove a low first-time shot from a tight angle that hit the outside of the post. After a nervy start, Everton have been terrific in the last 10 minutes. 21 min \u201cGreetings Rob,\u201d says Ian Sargeant. \u201cWest Ham fan here. Halfway to new York with ba. Reliant on your good self and a dodgy wifi for updates whilst trying to stop my 14 yo from watching too much family guy. Trying to decide whether to watch toy story 4 or the Maradona film next. Can you run a poll till half time?\u201d I think we all know what answer you\u2019ll get. More importantly, I had to read your third sentence at least four times before I realised that ba wasn\u2019t an affectionate name for your 14-year-old. 19 min Richarlison almost makes it 2-0 on the break. He skinned Diop with elegant ease in the inside-left channel, moved into the area and then couldn\u2019t decide whether to shoot or try to find Andre Gomes. In the end he tried to cut the ball back into the centre, and Ogbonna put it behind for a corner. It was made by the lively Walcott, who cut infield from the right and played a nice through pass to Bernard on the right side of the area. He decided not to shoot first time, which looked a poor decision, instead cutting back inside Masuaku. Then he wriggled back outside Masuaku and, from a very tight angle, poked the ball under the left armpit of the outrushing Roberto. It was poor goalkeeping from Roberto, who was beaten on the inside, but Bernard won\u2019t care. Everton take the lead with a peculiar solo goal from Bernard! 13 min It hasn\u2019t been a great game so far. Everton have been the better side though. 8 min: Great save by Roberto! That corner led to another, this time on the left. It was flicked on at the near post and sidefooted towards goal on the volley by Davies, six yards out. It looked a certain goal, but Roberto dived to his left to shovel it away. On reflection, Davies should probably have scored - it wasn\u2019t the cleanest connection, nor was it right in the corner - but it was still a brilliant save. 7 min Fine play from Walcott. He controls a long ball on the edge of the area, spins outside and then back inside Ogbonna before hitting an early shot towards the far corner. Ogbonna dangles a leg to deflect it behind for a corner. 6 min Everton win the first corner of the match. Masuaku heads it clear, and that\u2019s that. 4 min ... and he curls it well wide. 3 min Felipe Anderson is fouled by Richarlison, 25 yards from goal. It\u2019s slightly to the left of centre, perfect for Lanzini... 2 min The atmosphere is a wee bit muted. The first goal feels particularly important today. 1 min Peep peep! West Ham, in their cracking clartet-and-blue kit, kick off from left to right. Everton are in blue. Pre-match reading Everton (4-2-3-1) Pickford; Sidibe, Keane, Mina, Digne; Andre Gomes, Davies; Walcott, Iwobi, Bernard; Richarlison.

      "body": "<p>Perhaps Marco Silva was right not to panic after all. The Everton manager\u2019s job looks a lot safer after his side inflicted a first away defeat on West Ham, climbing out of the bottom three in the process.</p> <p>This was by no means West Ham\u2019s most convincing performance of the season; despite their league position they were disappointingly ponderous so it might be a little early for anyone to get carried away, though here at least was evidence that Everton can play in the way Silva keeps insisting he demands.</p> <p>The manager made five outfield changes from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/05/burnley-everton-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">dismal display at Burnley</a> and was rewarded by the sight of players in blue passing quickly, finding each other well and putting pressure on the visitors\u2019 defence from the outset. If one had to be critical it could be said that Everton\u2019s decision-making in the final third was not as impressive as the application and appetite they showed over the rest of the pitch, which was one reason why their superiority did not show in the scoreline until Gylfi Sigurdsson made victory certain with only seconds remaining, but a crowd-pleasing win was exactly what was needed after a miserable few weeks.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2019/oct/19/everton-v-west-ham-premier-league-live\">Everton 2-0 West Ham: Premier League \u2013 live!</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe should have scored more goals, but it is important to talk about the way we played,\u201d Silva said. \u201cPressure is normal in football, whether you are winning or losing. Our last few results were not good enough, so we had to react. We controlled the game and created a lot of chances. It was good to see.\u201d</p> <p>Manuel Pellegrini could not disagree. \u201cThey played better than we did,\u201d the West Ham manager said, after admitting he felt like making 11 changes at half-time. That would have been hard on his goalkeeper, actually, but it was a fair comment on a vapid outfield showing. \u201cEverton gave more than 100%, while we were not at our best.\u201d</p> <p>Bernard scored the goal that mattered early in the first half, fastening on to Theo Walcott\u2019s delightfully disguised pass and appearing to take the wrong option in disdaining a first-time shot, only to outwit Arthur Masuaku and then Roberto Jim\u00e9nez to find the net from an improbably narrow angle.</p> <p>West Ham could not complain; they could easily have gone behind 10 minutes earlier when a corner found its way to Tom Davies at the far post and an indecisive finish allowed Jim\u00e9nez to make a point-blank save.</p> <p>Time and again in the first half Everton made rapid progress down the left through Bernard and Lucas Digne, only to run out of ideas on the edge of the West Ham penalty area. Richarlison hit a post but shots from Walcott and Alex Iwobi were from too far out to cause Jim\u00e9nez any problems.</p> <p>The same pattern continued in the second half, which began with an otherwise crisp finish by Richarlison being denied by an offside flag. Walcott hit the bar from 25 yards, Yerry Mina saw a couple of headers from corners saved and Iwobi missed a glorious chance to seal victory after excellent work by Andr\u00e9 Gomes and Djibril Sidib\u00e9, who ghosted unchallenged into the area but put his shot far too close to Jim\u00e9nez.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2019/oct/19/tottenham-v-watford-chelsea-v-newcastle-and-more-live\">Tottenham v Watford, Chelsea v Newcastle and more \u2013 live!</a> </p> </aside>  <p>West Ham were largely dormant for more than an hour, though as full time approached with a draw still a possibility they stepped up their effort for an equaliser. They might have had one too but after a quiet afternoon Jordan Pickford\u2019s reflexes were still up to keeping out a close-range effort from Angelo Ogbonna in what amounted to the visitors\u2019 best chance.</p> <p>By the time Sigurdsson came on to bring a dramatic save from Jim\u00e9nez at the other end before beating him with another shot from outside the area in added time, Everton could reflect on the fact that they ought to have won by three or four clear goals.</p> <p>While work on finishing and final delivery is obviously required, the main positive for Silva was a midfield that clicked. Behind the front line Davies and Gomes operated smoothly and stylishly. Spectacular as Sigurdsson\u2019s late right-foot strike was, the Iceland international may no longer be able to take a place in the starting lineup for granted.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Perhaps Marco Silva was right not to panic after all. The Everton manager\u2019s job looks a lot safer after his side inflicted a first away defeat on West Ham, climbing out of the bottom three in the process. This was by no means West Ham\u2019s most convincing performance of the season; despite their league position they were disappointingly ponderous so it might be a little early for anyone to get carried away, though here at least was evidence that Everton can play in the way Silva keeps insisting he demands. The manager made five outfield changes from the dismal display at Burnley and was rewarded by the sight of players in blue passing quickly, finding each other well and putting pressure on the visitors\u2019 defence from the outset. If one had to be critical it could be said that Everton\u2019s decision-making in the final third was not as impressive as the application and appetite they showed over the rest of the pitch, which was one reason why their superiority did not show in the scoreline until Gylfi Sigurdsson made victory certain with only seconds remaining, but a crowd-pleasing win was exactly what was needed after a miserable few weeks. \u201cWe should have scored more goals, but it is important to talk about the way we played,\u201d Silva said. \u201cPressure is normal in football, whether you are winning or losing. Our last few results were not good enough, so we had to react. We controlled the game and created a lot of chances. It was good to see.\u201d Manuel Pellegrini could not disagree. \u201cThey played better than we did,\u201d the West Ham manager said, after admitting he felt like making 11 changes at half-time. That would have been hard on his goalkeeper, actually, but it was a fair comment on a vapid outfield showing. \u201cEverton gave more than 100%, while we were not at our best.\u201d Bernard scored the goal that mattered early in the first half, fastening on to Theo Walcott\u2019s delightfully disguised pass and appearing to take the wrong option in disdaining a first-time shot, only to outwit Arthur Masuaku and then Roberto Jim\u00e9nez to find the net from an improbably narrow angle. West Ham could not complain; they could easily have gone behind 10 minutes earlier when a corner found its way to Tom Davies at the far post and an indecisive finish allowed Jim\u00e9nez to make a point-blank save. Time and again in the first half Everton made rapid progress down the left through Bernard and Lucas Digne, only to run out of ideas on the edge of the West Ham penalty area. Richarlison hit a post but shots from Walcott and Alex Iwobi were from too far out to cause Jim\u00e9nez any problems. The same pattern continued in the second half, which began with an otherwise crisp finish by Richarlison being denied by an offside flag. Walcott hit the bar from 25 yards, Yerry Mina saw a couple of headers from corners saved and Iwobi missed a glorious chance to seal victory after excellent work by Andr\u00e9 Gomes and Djibril Sidib\u00e9, who ghosted unchallenged into the area but put his shot far too close to Jim\u00e9nez. West Ham were largely dormant for more than an hour, though as full time approached with a draw still a possibility they stepped up their effort for an equaliser. They might have had one too but after a quiet afternoon Jordan Pickford\u2019s reflexes were still up to keeping out a close-range effort from Angelo Ogbonna in what amounted to the visitors\u2019 best chance. By the time Sigurdsson came on to bring a dramatic save from Jim\u00e9nez at the other end before beating him with another shot from outside the area in added time, Everton could reflect on the fact that they ought to have won by three or four clear goals. While work on finishing and final delivery is obviously required, the main positive for Silva was a midfield that clicked. Behind the front line Davies and Gomes operated smoothly and stylishly. Spectacular as Sigurdsson\u2019s late right-foot strike was, the Iceland international may no longer be able to take a place in the starting lineup for granted.",

In August, a picture in the same collection, <em>Orpheus Enchanting the Animals</em>, was upgraded from coming from a little-known Titian follower, Alessandro Varotari, to Titian\u2019s workshop.</p> <p>Yesterday Hope, the former director of the Warburg Institute, a research centre associated with London University, challenged <em>The Dana\u00eb</em>\u2019s attribution, suggesting that it was by a north European follower of Titian rather than an Italian artist. He argued that the \u201cmuch more beautiful\u201d version in the Prado, Madrid, is the original Titian sent to Philip II of Spain, his greatest patron, for whom he painted an epic series of large-scale mythological paintings.</p> <p>However, another leading expert, Professor Paul Joannides, who believes the Apsley House picture is the version painted for the king, maintains that the radically free handling of the Prado <em>Dana\u00eb</em> resembles nothing else by Titian around 1550.</p> <p>But comparisons with works of that date cannot be made as so little has survived, Hope said. \u201cThe one thing everybody agrees on is that the Prado picture is much more beautiful than any other [version]. So why didn\u2019t Titian send the most beautiful one to Philip? Why does he do a less good picture for the king?\u201d</p> <p>Four years ago Hope\u2019s doubts appeared in the scholarly <em>Burlington Magazine</em>, but he has spoken out now because the Apsley House painting \u2013 rather than the Prado version \u2013 will be included in next year\u2019s touring exhibition. Hope said: \u201cThe one that\u2019s now in the Prado, which everybody for the last four centuries believed is the real Titian, is the real Titian and the picture [he painted] for Philip II. The Apsley House one is a sub-Titian. It isn\u2019t the picture for Philip II.\u201d</p> <p>Noting the Apsley House picture\u2019s weaknesses, he said: \u201cThe most obvious one is the Disney caricature of an old woman. It doesn\u2019t look like Titian\u2019s old women at all.\u201d He also criticised the brushwork as \u201cinferior\u201d.</p> <p>He pointed to a contemporary description of <em>The Dana\u00eb</em> at the Alc\u00e1zar in 1626, when only one picture of this subject attributed to Titian was in the Spanish royal collection. That account referred to \u201cgold coins gushing down \u2026 in the form of rain. The Prado picture includes golden rain in the form of coins, while the Apsley House picture consists only of golden raindrops\u201d.</p> <p>Joannides could not be reached yesterday but, in a subsequent <em>Burlington</em> article, he and Miguel Falomir, director of the Prado, argued that many of those raindrops are large enough to have been remembered by that contemporary as coins. They concluded that, although the Apsley House Dana\u00eb had been ignored or dismissed by scholars until recently, a 2013 restoration revealed that its \u201ctechnique and handling were wholly compatible with Titian\u2019s work c.1550 and not with that of a later pastiche\u201d.</p>",

In August, a picture in the same collection, Orpheus Enchanting the Animals, was upgraded from coming from a little-known Titian follower, Alessandro Varotari, to Titian\u2019s workshop. Yesterday Hope, the former director of the Warburg Institute, a research centre associated with London University, challenged The Dana\u00eb\u2019s attribution, suggesting that it was by a north European follower of Titian rather than an Italian artist. He argued that the \u201cmuch more beautiful\u201d version in the Prado, Madrid, is the original Titian sent to Philip II of Spain, his greatest patron, for whom he painted an epic series of large-scale mythological paintings. However, another leading expert, Professor Paul Joannides, who believes the Apsley House picture is the version painted for the king, maintains that the radically free handling of the Prado Dana\u00eb resembles nothing else by Titian around 1550. But comparisons with works of that date cannot be made as so little has survived, Hope said. \u201cThe one thing everybody agrees on is that the Prado picture is much more beautiful than any other [version]. So why didn\u2019t Titian send the most beautiful one to Philip? Why does he do a less good picture for the king?\u201d Four years ago Hope\u2019s doubts appeared in the scholarly Burlington Magazine, but he has spoken out now because the Apsley House painting \u2013 rather than the Prado version \u2013 will be included in next year\u2019s touring exhibition. Hope said: \u201cThe one that\u2019s now in the Prado, which everybody for the last four centuries believed is the real Titian, is the real Titian and the picture [he painted] for Philip II. The Apsley House one is a sub-Titian. It isn\u2019t the picture for Philip II.\u201d Noting the Apsley House picture\u2019s weaknesses, he said: \u201cThe most obvious one is the Disney caricature of an old woman. It doesn\u2019t look like Titian\u2019s old women at all.\u201d He also criticised the brushwork as \u201cinferior\u201d. He pointed to a contemporary description of The Dana\u00eb at the Alc\u00e1zar in 1626, when only one picture of this subject attributed to Titian was in the Spanish royal collection. That account referred to \u201cgold coins gushing down \u2026 in the form of rain. The Prado picture includes golden rain in the form of coins, while the Apsley House picture consists only of golden raindrops\u201d. Joannides could not be reached yesterday but, in a subsequent Burlington article, he and Miguel Falomir, director of the Prado, argued that many of those raindrops are large enough to have been remembered by that contemporary as coins. They concluded that, although the Apsley House Dana\u00eb had been ignored or dismissed by scholars until recently, a 2013 restoration revealed that its \u201ctechnique and handling were wholly compatible with Titian\u2019s work c.1550 and not with that of a later pastiche\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>In a city dripping with Renaissance jewels, the restored <em>Last Supper </em><a href=\"https://news.artnet.com/exhibitions/plautilla-nelli-last-supper-1681627\" title=\"\">unveiled last week</a> looks at first glance like just another masterpiece by one of the great artists of the 16th century.</p> <p>Which it is. But look a little closer, and you notice one astonishing detail \u2013 the name on the canvas. The artist who signed it was female. She was Plautilla Nelli: a contemporary of Michelangelo, Titian and Tintoretto; a native of Florence who spent her entire life in the city in which her greatest work has now been rediscovered; a woman who managed to paint at a time when women were effectively forbidden from doing so; and a nun.</p> <p>Nelli is one of the female painters art history forgot, but 15 years ago Jane Fortune, an American visiting Italy, chanced upon a market-stall book that mentioned a work by a Renaissance woman at the Museum of San Marco. Fortune went to look for the work, <em>The Lamentation</em> \u2013 the guard on duty told her no one had ever asked to see it before \u2013 and she was captivated. She formed an organisation, <a href=\"http://advancingwomenartists.org/\" title=\"\">Advancing Women Artists,</a> to seek out the work of Nelli and other women who had been written out of art history \u2013 and over the years since, about 20 of Nelli\u2019s drawings and paintings have been found languishing in museum storage, or tucked away in dark corners on church walls.</p> <p><em>The Last Supper,</em> painted in the 1560s, is Nelli\u2019s masterpiece, and has been undergoing restoration for the past four years. It\u2019s a vast 7x2-metre canvas, and the all-female team responsible for its resurrection hope that it will restore Nelli to the canon of art history, where they believe she belongs. Speaking at a press conference in Florence this week, restorer Rossella Lari said that she had been aware, as she worked, of Nelli\u2019s power as a painter. \u201cShe used wide brushstrokes, and she was quite forceful.

      "bodyText": "In a city dripping with Renaissance jewels, the restored Last Supper unveiled last week looks at first glance like just another masterpiece by one of the great artists of the 16th century. Which it is. But look a little closer, and you notice one astonishing detail \u2013 the name on the canvas. The artist who signed it was female. She was Plautilla Nelli: a contemporary of Michelangelo, Titian and Tintoretto; a native of Florence who spent her entire life in the city in which her greatest work has now been rediscovered; a woman who managed to paint at a time when women were effectively forbidden from doing so; and a nun. Nelli is one of the female painters art history forgot, but 15 years ago Jane Fortune, an American visiting Italy, chanced upon a market-stall book that mentioned a work by a Renaissance woman at the Museum of San Marco. Fortune went to look for the work, The Lamentation \u2013 the guard on duty told her no one had ever asked to see it before \u2013 and she was captivated. She formed an organisation, Advancing Women Artists, to seek out the work of Nelli and other women who had been written out of art history \u2013 and over the years since, about 20 of Nelli\u2019s drawings and paintings have been found languishing in museum storage, or tucked away in dark corners on church walls. The Last Supper, painted in the 1560s, is Nelli\u2019s masterpiece, and has been undergoing restoration for the past four years. It\u2019s a vast 7x2-metre canvas, and the all-female team responsible for its resurrection hope that it will restore Nelli to the canon of art history, where they believe she belongs. Speaking at a press conference in Florence this week, restorer Rossella Lari said that she had been aware, as she worked, of Nelli\u2019s power as a painter. \u201cShe used wide brushstrokes, and she was quite forceful. She paid extraordinary attention to detail \u2013 you can see the veins on the apostles\u2019 hands, and the cuticles on their fingernails.\u201d In her article in the catalogue published to mark the unveiling of the painting, Lari describes the work as \u201ca supremely balanced composition\u201d. Silvia Colucci, director of the Santa Maria Novella Museum in Florence where the painting will hang, said that Nelli had been \u201ctotally forgotten, in oblivion\u201d, which contrasted with how she had been received during her lifetime. \u201cShe was very successful in her own day \u2013 she was one of very few women mentioned by [the pivotal art historian] Vasari, and in her lifetime her works were much sought after by wealthy Florentines,\u201d she said. \u201cAlso, the way she signed the painting \u2013 she added the words \u2018Pray for the Paintress\u2019 after her name \u2013 was an important act of self-affirmation, because she was claiming her status as an artist.\u201d She was born Polissena Marguerita Nelli in January 1524, the second child of a draper called Piero and his wife Francesca, who lived in the San Felice area of Florence. At the time, about 50% of educated girls in the city were deposited in convents, so that their families did not have to pay dowries \u2013 and in 1538 she entered the Dominican convent of Santa Caterina di Cafaggio, becoming Sister Plautilla \u2013 a decision that would open the door to a career virtually unheard of for a female in 16th-century Florence. It was a time of great artistic creation in the city \u2013 but membership of the guilds, which licensed practitioners of the arts and provided for them to train and to sell their work, was restricted to men. The only painting that women could do was of miniatures for their own use; the small number of women who broke through the barriers tended to be the daughters of established male artists, whose workshops gave them opportunities for informal instruction. Nelli, though, was different. \u201cShe didn\u2019t work alongside any professional male painter, and she didn\u2019t have any training as an artist,\u201d says Colucci. \u201cShe did, however, inherit some drawings from Fra Bartolomeo [a Renaissance artist who died seven years before she was born].\u201d These works, and the study of other pieces such as Franciabigio\u2019s Last Supper at the convent of La Calza in Florence, were invaluable to Nelli in pressing forward with her painting \u2013 but essentially, and extraordinarily given the quality of her work, she was self-taught. As indeed was noted by Vasari who devoted a whole passage to her in the second edition (1568) of his essential Renaissance text, The Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors and Architects: he describes her as \u201cbeginning little by little to draw and to imitate in colours pictures and paintings by excellent masters\u201d.

      "body": "<p>At some point during the melee that is this Slowthai gig, a bra lands on the stage. The grinning Northampton rapper drapes it over his head, a pair of flapping D-cups giving him the look of a demented puppy.</p> <p>The song is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRX2ME9scmg\" title=\"\">Ladies</a>, the track off his debut album, <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZsNnuaUSNs\" title=\"\">Nothing Great About Britain</a></em>, where Slowthai pays tribute to \u201cthe ladies\u201d \u2013 not just as makers of babies, but as makers of men. Like any number of rappers on both sides of the Atlantic, Tyron Frampton was raised by strong women in the face of considerable odds, an upbringing he details later on a track called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6RKVEe8ZjU\" title=\"\">Northampton\u2019s Child</a>. In short: teenage mum, absent dad, dodgy stepfather, a series of council flats, the death of his baby brother\u2026 it has all arguably contributed to making Slowthai the breakout British artist of 2019, in cultural significance, if not crude album sales.</p> <p>The bra ears, meanwhile, come accessorised with a John Lydon stare, a bottle of Buckfast, a T-shirt that says \u201cSlowthai\u201d in the form of the Irn-Bru logo, and, later, a bare chest with prison inmate-style tattoos \u2013 one of them Nothing Great About Britain. His wide, gappy smile speaks both of an overactive inner child and something darker.</p> <p>Another set of floppy ears roams the stage: Woioii the Crack Rabbit, a mascot with a filthy bunny head and demonic, glowing red eyes. Woioii has his own <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B19DY5mJbV3/\" title=\"\">Instagram</a> and apparently represents Slowthai\u2019s chemically inclined past. Two songs in is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzccfphVosc\" title=\"\">Drug Dealer</a>, in which the young Frampton \u2013 a stigmatised young male from the <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/nekvqx/slowthais-guide-to-northampton-east-midlands-uk-rap-2018\" title=\"\">\u201cBush\u201d area of Northampton</a>, where the council estates are hidden behind a screen of trees \u2013 answers a teacher\u2019s question about his future plans with a truthful reply. He\u2019ll be a drug dealer when he grows up. (\u201cSorry mum\u201d is another of his tattoos.)</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Nothing Great About Britain uses his hyper-local reference points to make universal arguments about class and race</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Alongside Slowthai\u2019s DJ, producer and hype man, Kwes Darko, Woioii is there to swirl up a moshpit that doesn\u2019t actually require risotto levels of prodding. A circle pit takes up all the space between the stage and the mixing desk in this sold-out 1,250-capacity venue. The gig was recently upgraded to accommodate demand \u2013 in no way was a smaller <em>bo\u00eete</em> elsewhere in this warehouse complex going to contain all this consensual aggro. Slowthai\u2019s sonics tend largely towards grime and US hip-hop, but the action has the muscular gaiety of a punk gig. \u201cRun clockwise in a circle until your feet fall off!\u201d he commands at one point, part chaos-bringer, part drill sergeant. He could easily be caricatured as the attack dog of austerity Britain \u2013 <em>Nothing Great About Britain</em> uses his hyper-local reference points to make universal arguments about class, race, the withdrawn ladders of social mobility and slippery slopes snaking down \u2013 but Slowthai\u2019s gleeful charisma makes his a more complex offering than that.</p> <p>In medieval times, court jesters were licensed to tell truth to power, provided they entertained. Slowthai is fulfilling that brief in 2019. Sometimes he is direct and uncouth (\u201cElizabeth, you cunt,\u201d he quips, on the title track of his debut album). There are a couple of dud songs in this set, where the energy levels drop and the tunes don\u2019t quite make up for it.</p> <p>Sometimes, however, there is a greater degree of sophistication at play.

      "bodyText": "At some point during the melee that is this Slowthai gig, a bra lands on the stage. The grinning Northampton rapper drapes it over his head, a pair of flapping D-cups giving him the look of a demented puppy. The song is Ladies, the track off his debut album, Nothing Great About Britain, where Slowthai pays tribute to \u201cthe ladies\u201d \u2013 not just as makers of babies, but as makers of men. Like any number of rappers on both sides of the Atlantic, Tyron Frampton was raised by strong women in the face of considerable odds, an upbringing he details later on a track called Northampton\u2019s Child. In short: teenage mum, absent dad, dodgy stepfather, a series of council flats, the death of his baby brother\u2026 it has all arguably contributed to making Slowthai the breakout British artist of 2019, in cultural significance, if not crude album sales. The bra ears, meanwhile, come accessorised with a John Lydon stare, a bottle of Buckfast, a T-shirt that says \u201cSlowthai\u201d in the form of the Irn-Bru logo, and, later, a bare chest with prison inmate-style tattoos \u2013 one of them Nothing Great About Britain. His wide, gappy smile speaks both of an overactive inner child and something darker. Another set of floppy ears roams the stage: Woioii the Crack Rabbit, a mascot with a filthy bunny head and demonic, glowing red eyes. Woioii has his own Instagram and apparently represents Slowthai\u2019s chemically inclined past. Two songs in is Drug Dealer, in which the young Frampton \u2013 a stigmatised young male from the \u201cBush\u201d area of Northampton, where the council estates are hidden behind a screen of trees \u2013 answers a teacher\u2019s question about his future plans with a truthful reply. He\u2019ll be a drug dealer when he grows up. (\u201cSorry mum\u201d is another of his tattoos.) Alongside Slowthai\u2019s DJ, producer and hype man, Kwes Darko, Woioii is there to swirl up a moshpit that doesn\u2019t actually require risotto levels of prodding. A circle pit takes up all the space between the stage and the mixing desk in this sold-out 1,250-capacity venue. The gig was recently upgraded to accommodate demand \u2013 in no way was a smaller bo\u00eete elsewhere in this warehouse complex going to contain all this consensual aggro. Slowthai\u2019s sonics tend largely towards grime and US hip-hop, but the action has the muscular gaiety of a punk gig. \u201cRun clockwise in a circle until your feet fall off!\u201d he commands at one point, part chaos-bringer, part drill sergeant. He could easily be caricatured as the attack dog of austerity Britain \u2013 Nothing Great About Britain uses his hyper-local reference points to make universal arguments about class, race, the withdrawn ladders of social mobility and slippery slopes snaking down \u2013 but Slowthai\u2019s gleeful charisma makes his a more complex offering than that. In medieval times, court jesters were licensed to tell truth to power, provided they entertained. Slowthai is fulfilling that brief in 2019. Sometimes he is direct and uncouth (\u201cElizabeth, you cunt,\u201d he quips, on the title track of his debut album). There are a couple of dud songs in this set, where the energy levels drop and the tunes don\u2019t quite make up for it. Sometimes, however, there is a greater degree of sophistication at play. His ideas can startle. Instead of a backdrop, the Bet Ya a \u00a35er tour (tickets: \u00a35) features a clever trick: lots of mirrors, as you might find in a perv\u2019s boudoir. Not, as Slowthai later jokes, to show off how great the back of him looks, but to hold up a mirror to what is actually great about Britain, its people \u2013 or Slowthai fans, at any rate. Even in an age of social media, Slowthai is particularly fan-forward, using Twitter to max out the guest list, inviting an audience member \u2013 tonight, make way for Phoebe \u2013 on stage to perform the absent guest MC Skepta\u2019s verse on Inglorious. At the Mercury prize ceremony last month, Slowthai may not have won the album of the year prize (Dave did), but he dominated the talking points by waving around a rubbery severed head of Boris Johnson. Tonight\u2019s merch stall is doing a roaring trade in those obscene Boris Ts, a \u201cfuck Boris\u201d chant echoing even after the gig ends. While the Mercury symbolism was blunt, Slowthai\u2019s Twitter justification \u2013 not an apology \u2013 explained his actions: \u201cThe people in power who are trying to isolate and divide us are not the ones who will feel its effects the hardest. They\u2019re not the ones queuing at the food banks, not the ones navigating universal credit, and not the ones having to deal with systematic oppression and hate crimes at the hands of privileged politicians who say what they want without fear and consequence.\u201d Tonight, the pontificating is kept to a minimum: there are many young pores to open in this sweat bath and belongings to sacrifice to the pit (\u201cYou lost your glasses?

And if the set list mostly revisits songs from his five-month-old album \u2013 it feels like it has been around far longer \u2013 a couple of tracks point forwards. Slowthai has spoken vaguely of his next steps \u2013 an album that you can smell, \u201cgrowth\u201d, \u201cnot a follow-up or a sequel\u201d, but in the meantime, momentum is gathering further afield. Released last month, a new single, Psycho, found Slowthai combining with Florida rapper Denzel Curry in a two-hander that dripped with ferocity.

      "body": "<p>At a time when women\u2019s reproductive freedoms are under attack, any suggestion that the birth control pill could be problematic feels explosive. But Sarah E Hill, a professor of social psychology at the Texas Christian University in Fort Worth, Texas argues we need to talk about how oral contraceptives are affecting women\u2019s thinking, emotions and behaviour. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/how-the-pill-changes-everything-9781409178835.html\" title=\"\"><em>How the Pill Changes Everything: Your Brain on Birth Control</em></a> is her new book about the science behind a delicate subject.</p> <p><strong>Some US states have recently made it harder to get an abortion and the Trump administration is doing its best to </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/14/judge-blocks-trump-administration-contraception-rule\" title=\"\"><strong>chisel away at access to birth control</strong></a><strong>. Is your book trying to dissuade women from using the pill?</strong><br>My institution was founded as a Christian school, but it doesn\u2019t have a particular religious bent now. My goal with this book is not to take the pill away or alarm women. It is to give them information they haven\u2019t had up until now so they can make informed decisions. The pill, along with safe, legalised abortions, are the two biggest keys to women\u2019s rights. But we also have a blind spot when it comes to thinking about how changing women\u2019s sex hormones \u2013 which is what the pill does \u2013 influences their brains. For a long time, women have been experiencing \u201cpsychological\u201d side-effects on the pill but nobody was telling them why.</p> <p>The backlash we are seeing against the pill, particularly with <a href=\"https://www.cosmopolitan.com/sex-love/a18930043/are-young-women-over-the-pill/\" title=\"\">millennial women walking away from it</a>, I think is because women haven\u2019t felt right on it and have grown weary of doctors patting them on their heads and telling them they are wrong. The more information women have, the more it will bring them back to the pill.</p> <p><strong>How exactly does the pill affect women\u2019s brains?</strong><br>The pill works mainly by mimicking the second half of a woman\u2019s monthly ovulatory cycle, in which the hormone progesterone is dominant. Its primary ingredient is artificial progesterone \u2013 so-called progestin \u2013 which shuts down the brain signal that prompts egg development. But that also means the ovaries aren\u2019t producing oestrogen, the hormone which dominates the first half of a woman\u2019s natural cycle. And oestrogen does some of our favourite things to our brains and bodies, making us feel sexier and more energetic. While most pills include some synthetic oestrogen \u2013 primarily to offset progestin\u2019s unpleasant side-effects \u2013 women can feel the lack.</p> <p>A less well-understood mechanism is that progestins, which are often created by changing the molecular structure of testosterone, aren\u2019t an exact match for our progesterone receptors. This means they can potentially stimulate other receptors, including those for testosterone, leading to masculinising effects, and for cortisol, which over time can dysregulate stress response. The stress hormone profile of pill-taking women, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5658328/\" title=\"\">research suggests</a>, is similar to people who have experienced chronic stress. Other research has found effects on the <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5592309/\" title=\"\">immune system</a>, learning and memory.</p> <p><strong>We know a lot about the small but serious health risks associated with the pill \u2013 things like stroke and blood clots. Why have we been kept in the dark about the effects on the brain?</strong><br>Until very recently, there has been little research. And the research that is out there doctors often aren\u2019t aware of because it isn\u2019t being published in the medical journals they look at, but rather in psychology and neuroscience journals. Then society has taboos about talking about it. The best defence against the sexist notion that women\u2019s hormones make them less rational than men seemed to be to deny hormonal involvement in the brain. And the pill is so useful, no one is motivated to examine it too critically. But our hormones, especially our sex hormones, are a key part of what creates the experience of feeling like ourselves. And talking critically about the pill doesn\u2019t mean that the benefits aren\u2019t going to outweigh the cost. It\u2019s not antithetical to women\u2019s rights to talk about this stuff.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Some women are going to experience big changes while others are going to have none</p> <footer> <cite>Sarah E Hill</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>How does the pill potentially affect women\u2019s choice of mate?</strong><br>Oestrogen is known to nudge women\u2019s preferences when it comes to their romantic partners to favour qualities that are associated with masculinity and higher testosterone: square-cut jaws, broad shoulders and brow ridges, for example. But <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23528282\" title=\"\">research suggests</a> pill-taking women \u2013 in their state of artificial progesterone dominance and lacking a cyclical oestrogen urge \u2013 seem to prefer the faces of men who are less masculine. The implication is that if a woman chooses her partner when she\u2019s on the pill and then goes off it \u2013 it might lead to relationship dissatisfaction because she no longer finds herself as attracted to the person. It is a possibility that women should at least keep in mind. </p> <p><strong>What about the mood changes women report on the pill?</strong><br>Being on the pill is associated with an <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2552796\" title=\"\">increased risk of being diagnosed</a> with anxiety and depression, though there are some women who report the pill stabilises their moods. The association was particulary high in young women aged 15-19 and their suicide risk is also more than <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29145752\" title=\"\">twice that of non-pill takers</a>. A dysregulated stress response is likely part of the picture, but another driver seems to be low levels of the neurosteroid allopregnanolone \u2013 a breakdown product of progesterone that acts as a natural sedative. In pill-taking women, the <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0028390801001873\" title=\"\">research suggests</a>, levels are significantly lower than in naturally cycling women. Women starting the pill should keep a mood journal or tell a friend to keep an eye on them, especially if they have a personal or family history of mood-related symptoms. For young women, the pill may not be worth the trade-off if it is being used for reasons other than to prevent pregnancy \u2013 for example to clear acne or regulate periods.</p> <p><strong>How big are the effects you are talking about?</strong><br>They are relatively small. But at an individual level, some women are going to experience big changes while others are going to have absolutely none. Each woman should know about the research that\u2019s out there so they can monitor themselves and troubleshoot.</p> <p><strong>There are over 100 different formulations of pill along with multiple other hormonal birth control options. Should we treat them the same?</strong><br>The signalling is going to be different. Progestins divide into four different generations each with a somewhat different molecular structure. Each pill can also have a different ratio of progestin to artificial oestrogen. Right now, the research that exists rarely divides women based on the type of progestin they are on, let alone the ratios. We need to push science to start looking at this.</p> <p><strong>Should women seek alternatives to the pill?</strong><br>I am not making recommendations to any individual woman. Each knows what her own life goals are and how her body feels. But I do advise women to be strategic in their use of the pill. Understand the psychological trade-offs and then decide whether or not you want to use it. For a lot of women, the answer is still going to be yes, but now they choose knowing that information. With all the different formulations out there, I am confident women who want to use the pill are going to be able to find one that works for them. For women who are looking for something which doesn\u2019t have hormones in it, the copper IUD is one of the most failsafe.</p> <p><strong>Are you concerned that raising these issues might turn women to less effective methods of birth control that could leave them with unwanted pregnancies?</strong><br>It is the last thing I want to have happen. I\u2019m hoping we can use this moment to educate ourselves, but still recognise how important it is to protect ourselves from unwanted pregnancy. Not being pregnant when you don\u2019t want to be pregnant \u2013 for me the benefits of that far outweigh almost any brain changes the pill can cause.</p> <p><strong>You say the issue of birth control is not yet solved. So what would solve it? Better pills, a male pill, or something new entirely?</strong><br>Ideally we want contraception that\u2019s really safe and effective that doesn\u2019t monkey with anyone\u2019s brain. Maybe that means more investment in the copper IUD. Or maybe it is something yet to be invented. But we need the imagination of the best researchers on this issue. The pill works so well and is so easy, we\u2019ve become complacent. And in the meantime, we need more and better research to understand what we\u2019ve got.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>How the Pill Changes Everything: Your Brain on Birth Control </em>is published by Orion (\u00a319.99).

But we also have a blind spot when it comes to thinking about how changing women\u2019s sex hormones \u2013 which is what the pill does \u2013 influences their brains. For a long time, women have been experiencing \u201cpsychological\u201d side-effects on the pill but nobody was telling them why. The backlash we are seeing against the pill, particularly with millennial women walking away from it, I think is because women haven\u2019t felt right on it and have grown weary of doctors patting them on their heads and telling them they are wrong. The more information women have, the more it will bring them back to the pill. How exactly does the pill affect women\u2019s brains? The pill works mainly by mimicking the second half of a woman\u2019s monthly ovulatory cycle, in which the hormone progesterone is dominant. Its primary ingredient is artificial progesterone \u2013 so-called progestin \u2013 which shuts down the brain signal that prompts egg development. But that also means the ovaries aren\u2019t producing oestrogen, the hormone which dominates the first half of a woman\u2019s natural cycle. And oestrogen does some of our favourite things to our brains and bodies, making us feel sexier and more energetic. While most pills include some synthetic oestrogen \u2013 primarily to offset progestin\u2019s unpleasant side-effects \u2013 women can feel the lack. A less well-understood mechanism is that progestins, which are often created by changing the molecular structure of testosterone, aren\u2019t an exact match for our progesterone receptors. This means they can potentially stimulate other receptors, including those for testosterone, leading to masculinising effects, and for cortisol, which over time can dysregulate stress response. The stress hormone profile of pill-taking women, research suggests, is similar to people who have experienced chronic stress. Other research has found effects on the immune system, learning and memory. We know a lot about the small but serious health risks associated with the pill \u2013 things like stroke and blood clots. Why have we been kept in the dark about the effects on the brain? Until very recently, there has been little research. And the research that is out there doctors often aren\u2019t aware of because it isn\u2019t being published in the medical journals they look at, but rather in psychology and neuroscience journals. Then society has taboos about talking about it. The best defence against the sexist notion that women\u2019s hormones make them less rational than men seemed to be to deny hormonal involvement in the brain. And the pill is so useful, no one is motivated to examine it too critically. But our hormones, especially our sex hormones, are a key part of what creates the experience of feeling like ourselves. And talking critically about the pill doesn\u2019t mean that the benefits aren\u2019t going to outweigh the cost. It\u2019s not antithetical to women\u2019s rights to talk about this stuff. How does the pill potentially affect women\u2019s choice of mate? Oestrogen is known to nudge women\u2019s preferences when it comes to their romantic partners to favour qualities that are associated with masculinity and higher testosterone: square-cut jaws, broad shoulders and brow ridges, for example. But research suggests pill-taking women \u2013 in their state of artificial progesterone dominance and lacking a cyclical oestrogen urge \u2013 seem to prefer the faces of men who are less masculine. The implication is that if a woman chooses her partner when she\u2019s on the pill and then goes off it \u2013 it might lead to relationship dissatisfaction because she no longer finds herself as attracted to the person. It is a possibility that women should at least keep in mind. What about the mood changes women report on the pill? Being on the pill is associated with an increased risk of being diagnosed with anxiety and depression, though there are some women who report the pill stabilises their moods. The association was particulary high in young women aged 15-19 and their suicide risk is also more than twice that of non-pill takers. A dysregulated stress response is likely part of the picture, but another driver seems to be low levels of the neurosteroid allopregnanolone \u2013 a breakdown product of progesterone that acts as a natural sedative. In pill-taking women, the research suggests, levels are significantly lower than in naturally cycling women. Women starting the pill should keep a mood journal or tell a friend to keep an eye on them, especially if they have a personal or family history of mood-related symptoms. For young women, the pill may not be worth the trade-off if it is being used for reasons other than to prevent pregnancy \u2013 for example to clear acne or regulate periods. How big are the effects you are talking about? They are relatively small. But at an individual level, some women are going to experience big changes while others are going to have absolutely none. Each woman should know about the research that\u2019s out there so they can monitor themselves and troubleshoot. There are over 100 different formulations of pill along with multiple other hormonal birth control options. Should we treat them the same? The signalling is going to be different. Progestins divide into four different generations each with a somewhat different molecular structure. Each pill can also have a different ratio of progestin to artificial oestrogen. Right now, the research that exists rarely divides women based on the type of progestin they are on, let alone the ratios. We need to push science to start looking at this. Should women seek alternatives to the pill? I am not making recommendations to any individual woman. Each knows what her own life goals are and how her body feels. But I do advise women to be strategic in their use of the pill. Understand the psychological trade-offs and then decide whether or not you want to use it. For a lot of women, the answer is still going to be yes, but now they choose knowing that information. With all the different formulations out there, I am confident women who want to use the pill are going to be able to find one that works for them. For women who are looking for something which doesn\u2019t have hormones in it, the copper IUD is one of the most failsafe. Are you concerned that raising these issues might turn women to less effective methods of birth control that could leave them with unwanted pregnancies? It is the last thing I want to have happen. I\u2019m hoping we can use this moment to educate ourselves, but still recognise how important it is to protect ourselves from unwanted pregnancy. Not being pregnant when you don\u2019t want to be pregnant \u2013 for me the benefits of that far outweigh almost any brain changes the pill can cause. You say the issue of birth control is not yet solved. So what would solve it? Better pills, a male pill, or something new entirely? Ideally we want contraception that\u2019s really safe and effective that doesn\u2019t monkey with anyone\u2019s brain. Maybe that means more investment in the copper IUD. Or maybe it is something yet to be invented. But we need the imagination of the best researchers on this issue. The pill works so well and is so easy, we\u2019ve become complacent. And in the meantime, we need more and better research to understand what we\u2019ve got. \u2022 How the Pill Changes Everything: Your Brain on Birth Control is published by Orion (\u00a319.99).

Joins the line so well, though. 6 Anthony Watson His footwork gave Koroibete a torrid time and was rewarded for his efforts with a try. Commanding under the high ball. 8 Henry Slade Strange one. Notably rusty at times but his kick for May\u2019s second try was the sublime moment of the match. 7 Manu Tuilagi It was his tackle that stopped Australia\u2019s early onslaught after 18 phases and his powerful carry that led to May\u2019s first try. 7 Jonny May Touched the ball three times in the first half and finished with two tries. Rolled up his sleeves in second half but injured late on. 8 Owen Farrell (capt) What. A. Pass. Nothing \u201cclunky\u201d about this display. Who knew he was an accomplished fly-half? Also flawless from the tee. 9 Ben Youngs Much better from the one player England cannot afford to lose. Not a great start but made a clever dart down the left. 7 Mako Vunipola Made 18 tackles in his 69 minutes, which is remarkable for someone who had not started a match since May. A great return. 8 Jamie George Lineout was not perfect and he gave away one penalty but a player who raises his game when temperature is at its highest. 8 Kyle Sinckler Scored a first England try and made a key turnover with his side under the pump. \u201cA runaway rhino,\u201d said Eddie Jones. 8 Maro Itoje Put his head where it hurts.

He studied at&nbsp;Eton and then Trinity College, Cambridge, and first became a Conservative MP in 1997.</p>\n    <p>However, his political career had started long before then, as he had served in Margaret Thatcher's policy unit from 1983 to 1986. The poll tax was an idea Letwin almost single-handedly kept alive in the mid-1980s. In a 1985 memo, he suggested it could be introduced in Scotland first as \u201ca trailblazer for the real thing\u201d.</p>\n    <p>In 2016 Letwin was forced to apologise after it emerged he had co-written a paper telling Thatcher that providing financial assistance for black unemployed youth after the 1985 riots would only end up in the \u201cdisco and drug trade\u201d. The memo, Letwin admitted, was \u201cbadly worded and wrong\u201d.</p>\n    <p>Letwin was forced into hiding in 2001 by a desperate Conservative party, after being outed as the minister who had&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/may/21/uk.election200115\">promis</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/may/21/uk.election200115\">ed \u00a320bn of tax and spending cuts</a>&nbsp;in an anonymous interview with the Financial Times, far beyond the party\u2019s manifesto at the time.</p>\n    <p>In many respects, the best periods of Letwin\u2019s career were in the policy engine room, not least when he acted as David Cameron\u2019s fixer, when he was a cabinet office minister in the coalition government. His influence went far beyond the ministerial title.</p>\n    <p>Then he wrestled with issues such as the future of press regulation in the aftermath of the Leveson inquiry. Letwin\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/dec/20/oliver-letwin-leveson-reforms\">big idea</a>, to deal with the fact that newspapers refused to accept statutory regulation, was to create an independent regulator backed by royal charter. It was neat, but the mainstream press refused to accept it.</p>\n    <p>Letwin has emerged as an unlikely Brexit rebel, going from being the ultimate loyalist to serial rebel, beginning in January 2019 when he voted with Labour to give Theresa May a two-week deadline to debate Brexit next steps if her deal was voted down.</p>\n    <p>\u201cMy right honourable friend&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?p=10555\">Sir Nicholas Soames</a>, who is sitting next to me, and I have calculated that we have been in the house, collectively, for 56 years, and we have only ever, either of us, voted once against the Conservative whip,\u201d Letwin said.</p>\n    <p>A month later his concerns had hardened, as demonstrated in a Commons speech in which he worried that \u201cwhen the chips are down\u201d the government \u201cwould prefer to do what some of my esteemed colleagues would prefer to do: head for the exit door without a deal\u201d. It was, he added, \u201ca terrifying fact\u201d \u2013 and one he resolved to prevent.</p>\n    <p>Ultimately it was to cost him his place in the Conservative party, as Prime Minister Boris Johnson removed the whip from 21 Tory rebels including Letwin, as his Brexit plans were thwarted yet again.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Dan Sabbagh</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>But in what appeared to be a signal that he was ready to write the letter mandated by the Benn act, he told MPs: \u201cWhatever letters they may seek to force the government to write, it cannot change my judgment that further delay is pointless, expensive and deeply corrosive of public trust.\u201d</p> \n<p>Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, rejected Johnson\u2019s defence of his deal, saying it would \u201cfire the starting gun on a race to the bottom\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cVoting for a deal today won\u2019t end Brexit. It won\u2019t deliver certainty and the people should have the final say. Labour is not prepared to sell out the communities we represent. We are not prepared to sell out their future. And we will not back this sell-out deal,\u201d he said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"36e59380-3340-4baf-9357-5e283b2b8ca3\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_4dtVnt2EU0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>After Johnson\u2019s speech, the government\u2019s motion was proposed by the Brexit secretary, Steve Barclay.</p> \n<p>The shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, responded by forensically highlighting the differences between the new deal and Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal agreement, including the absence of legal guarantees on workers\u2019 rights.</p> \n<p>Starmer cited Johnson\u2019s own remarks last November, that \u201cregulatory checks and customs controls between Britain and Northern Ireland would be damaging to the fabric of the union. No British Conservative government could or should sign up to such an arrangement.\u201d</p> \n<p>Starmer concluded: \u201cThe deal before this house is a thoroughly bad deal for jobs, rights and living standards, a bad deal for the future direction of this country \u2013 it will put us on the path to an entirely different economy and society: one of deregulation and divergence,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>He added: \u201cManufacturing having been on its knees, and now having revived at least in part, how anyone could take an axe to it, I will never understand,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we pass this deal today it will be a long way back for the communities we represent.\u201d</p> \n<p>It appears likely that MPs will pass Oliver Letwin\u2019s amendment, withholding support from the Brexit deal until the relevant legislation \u2013 the withdrawal agreement bill \u2013 has been passed.</p> \n<p>Speaking in support of his amendment, Letwin said its aim was \u201cto keep in place the insurance policy provided by the Benn act, which prevents us from crashing out automatically if there is no deal by 31 October\u201d.</p> \n<p>Government sources have suggested that if MPs inflict a defeat on Johnson by supporting the amendment, Conservative whips will effectively boycott the vote on the motion as amended, by sending MPs home.</p> \n<p>A No 10 spokesman said Johnson\u2019s focus was on winning the vote against the Letwin amendment \u2013 and suggested the rebel MPs\u2019 aim was not to provide for better scrutiny of the agreement, but to frustrate Brexit.</p> \n<p>\u201cI do think there is required a frankness from MPs about what this amendment is about,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should be clear to MPs thinking of voting for Letwin \u2013 it is more pointless delay.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/18/brexit-super-saturday-will-the-deal-pass\">Brexit 'super Saturday': your guide to the big day</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>If the government loses on the Letwin amendment, it is expected to boycott the rest of the day\u2019s proceedings, and press ahead with tabling the withdrawal agreement bill \u2013 the legislation needed to enact Brexit.</p> \n<p>The vote would still be expected to take place, and the motion would pass, but it would not be the \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d the government had hoped for. And it would trigger the requirements of the Benn act, forcing the government to request an extension to article 50.</p> \n<p>There could then be a vote on the second reading of the bill on Tuesday \u2013 which government sources suggested could effectively become the \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d denied Johnson on Saturday.</p> \n<p>The spokesman added that the public would expect MPs to work all the hours available \u2013 potentially sitting late and through weekends \u2013 to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d.</p> \n<p>In the run-up to Saturday\u2019s session, the balance of support in parliament for Johnson\u2019s deal appeared too close to call, with most of the Eurosceptics who held out against May\u2019s deal three times saying they would support it, as well as several Labour MPs, including Sarah Champion and Melanie Onn.</p>",

A desire to cooperate with our friends and partners in everything \u2013 creatively, artistically, intellectually. \u201cA sense of shared destiny. And a deep understanding of the eternal need, especially after the horrors of the last century, for Britain to stand as one of the guarantors of peace and democracy in our continent, and it is our continent,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s precisely because we are capable of feeling both things at once, sceptical about the modes of EU integration as we are but passionate and enthusiastic about Europe.\u201d He praised his Brexit agreement, which allows for a significantly looser economic relationship with the EU than the deal negotiated by Theresa May, calling it \u201ca deal that can heal the rift in British politics. Unite the warring instincts in us all.\u201d He stressed the UK\u2019s right to leave the EU customs union and single market and negotiate new free trade deals with non-EU countries. And he insisted the government had no intention of slashing the environmental standards or social protections that will no longer be guaranteed by law under the new deal. Johnson also dropped a heavy hint that he concedes he will be forced to request a Brexit delay if MPs defeat the government and pass a backbench amendment aimed at averting no deal. He said there was \u201cvery little appetite\u201d in the EU to delay Brexit \u201cby one single day\u201d, urging MPs to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d. But in what appeared to be a signal that he was ready to write the letter mandated by the Benn act, he told MPs: \u201cWhatever letters they may seek to force the government to write, it cannot change my judgment that further delay is pointless, expensive and deeply corrosive of public trust.\u201d Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, rejected Johnson\u2019s defence of his deal, saying it would \u201cfire the starting gun on a race to the bottom\u201d. \u201cVoting for a deal today won\u2019t end Brexit. It won\u2019t deliver certainty and the people should have the final say. Labour is not prepared to sell out the communities we represent. We are not prepared to sell out their future. And we will not back this sell-out deal,\u201d he said. After Johnson\u2019s speech, the government\u2019s motion was proposed by the Brexit secretary, Steve Barclay. The shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, responded by forensically highlighting the differences between the new deal and Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal agreement, including the absence of legal guarantees on workers\u2019 rights. Starmer cited Johnson\u2019s own remarks last November, that \u201cregulatory checks and customs controls between Britain and Northern Ireland would be damaging to the fabric of the union. No British Conservative government could or should sign up to such an arrangement.\u201d Starmer concluded: \u201cThe deal before this house is a thoroughly bad deal for jobs, rights and living standards, a bad deal for the future direction of this country \u2013 it will put us on the path to an entirely different economy and society: one of deregulation and divergence,\u201d he said. He added: \u201cManufacturing having been on its knees, and now having revived at least in part, how anyone could take an axe to it, I will never understand,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we pass this deal today it will be a long way back for the communities we represent.\u201d It appears likely that MPs will pass Oliver Letwin\u2019s amendment, withholding support from the Brexit deal until the relevant legislation \u2013 the withdrawal agreement bill \u2013 has been passed. Speaking in support of his amendment, Letwin said its aim was \u201cto keep in place the insurance policy provided by the Benn act, which prevents us from crashing out automatically if there is no deal by 31 October\u201d. Government sources have suggested that if MPs inflict a defeat on Johnson by supporting the amendment, Conservative whips will effectively boycott the vote on the motion as amended, by sending MPs home. A No 10 spokesman said Johnson\u2019s focus was on winning the vote against the Letwin amendment \u2013 and suggested the rebel MPs\u2019 aim was not to provide for better scrutiny of the agreement, but to frustrate Brexit. \u201cI do think there is required a frankness from MPs about what this amendment is about,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should be clear to MPs thinking of voting for Letwin \u2013 it is more pointless delay.\u201d If the government loses on the Letwin amendment, it is expected to boycott the rest of the day\u2019s proceedings, and press ahead with tabling the withdrawal agreement bill \u2013 the legislation needed to enact Brexit. The vote would still be expected to take place, and the motion would pass, but it would not be the \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d the government had hoped for. And it would trigger the requirements of the Benn act, forcing the government to request an extension to article 50. There could then be a vote on the second reading of the bill on Tuesday \u2013 which government sources suggested could effectively become the \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d denied Johnson on Saturday. The spokesman added that the public would expect MPs to work all the hours available \u2013 potentially sitting late and through weekends \u2013 to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d. In the run-up to Saturday\u2019s session, the balance of support in parliament for Johnson\u2019s deal appeared too close to call, with most of the Eurosceptics who held out against May\u2019s deal three times saying they would support it, as well as several Labour MPs, including Sarah Champion and Melanie Onn.",

      "bodyText": "Joe Schmidt speaks: \u201cWe gave them too many access points into the game,\u201d says Ireland\u2019s now former coach, as he agrees that today\u2019s outcome was the result of a combination of New Zealand being particularly good and Ireland being particularly poor. \u201cWe gave them a bit of a leg up and you just can\u2019t afford to do that,\u201d he says. Brian O\u2019Driscoll speaks: \u201cUltimately it will be seen as a disappointment,\u201d says the former Ireland international when asked how he thinks this campaign - one in which they lost to Japan and got hockeyed in yet another quarter-final - will be viewed by the Irish. That, ladies and gentlemen, is why he gets paid the big bucks. Rory Best speaks: Well, he doesn\u2019t - after his final game of rugby Ireland\u2019s captain looks like he\u2019s going to cry cry as the crowd cheer him. Then he speaks. \u201cThe All Blacks were fantastic,\u201d he says. \u201cWe felt we prepared well and we felt we had a game plan. They started well and put us on the back foot. They were really clinical and didn\u2019t let us get on the front foot. This is a front foot, momentum game. I think for now you just have to give credit to the All Blacks.\u201d Just the seven tries for New Zealand: They were simply outstanding today, going over seven times, albeit in the face of fairly feeble resistance from Ireland. It\u2019s all over: Having put in arguably their best performance since the last World Cup, New Zealand swat Ireland aside with a minimum of fuss. They were as outstanding as the Irish were inept and will now face England in the last four. For Ireland, it\u2019s yet another dismal failure to win a knockout match at a Rugby World Cup. They didn\u2019t show up today and were punished accordingly. 79 min New Zealand 46-14 Ireland Beauden Barrett is announced as the Man of the Match. It\u2019s a New Zealand scrum, five metres from the Ireland line. Another long pass kick out to the corner, from Beauden Barrett to his brother Jordie Barrett and he dives over in the corner in the face of shockingly bad Irish defending. Richie Mo\u2019unga misses the conversion. 78 min New Zealand 41-14 Ireland: Apologies, I meant they\u2019re right back on their own line, after another dreadful kick from Joey Carberry, who has been even more wayward off the boot than Johnny Sexton, who he replaced. 77 min New Zealand 41-14 Ireland: With Ireland camped on the New Zealand line, CJ Stander\u2019s route to touching the ball against the base of the upright by an offside Matt Todd. That\u2019s a yellow card for the cheating Kiwi and Ireland are right back in this game!!! 75 min New Zealand 41-7 Ireland: Ireland make their way towards the New Zealand line, going close to scoring a second try as Jordan Lamour chases a kick to the corner. 73 min New Zealand 41-7 Ireland Ardie Savea turns over possession for New Zealand. A burst through the centre and Dane Coles offloads to Bridge, who goes over. This is a massacre. 71 min New Zealand 34-7 Ireland: If anything, that consolation try has just riled up the All Blacks. They capitalise on more poor kicking from hand to make ground and a hot-knife-through-butter move looks guaranteed to end in a try until Anton Lienert-Brown misplaces a pass to TJ Perenara. 69 min New Zealand 34-7 Ireland From a five-metre scrum, CJ Stander takes the ball and makes a clever before passing to Henshaw, who darts over between the posts. The extra are added and it\u2019s game on! New Zealand are on the ropes! 68 min New Zealand 34-0 Ireland Robbie Henshaw fails to gather a little grubber kick in behind and a great try-scoring opportunity goes to waste for Ireland. 66 min New Zealand 34-0 Ireland Decent from Ireland, as Jacob Stockdale gallops down the right wing before being brought to ground. Irelandgo through the phases and are camped in front of the New Zealand posts, as the crowd roar them on, patronising them to within an inch of their lies. 65 min New Zealand 34-0 Ireland Another Irish penalty, another missed effort for touch. 63 min New Zealand 34-0 Ireland The conversion is missed and Ireland captain Rory Best goes off to rapturous applause from the Ireland fans, who have had little else to clap. That\u2019s him done with rugby after a fine career, although he\u2019ll be unhappy at having to sign off like this. 62 min New Zealand 34-0 Ireland From a lineout, New Zealand drive forward, smithereening the Irish pack. An inch-perfect cross-field kick from Mo\u2019unga is gathered on the far touchline and a ruck forms. The ball\u2019s picked out from the base of the ruck and fed to Matt Todd, who goes over. Sensational stuff from the All Blacks. 60 min New Zealand 29-0 Ireland A brilliant chip-and-chase from Beauden Barrett has New Zealand back on their own line, trying to clear with a relieving box-kick. 59 min New Zealand 29-0 Ireland \u201cOK we\u2019re going nowhere here, lads,\u201d says Owens, as New Zealand come up from the scrum early. After playing the advantage, he awards Ireland the penalty. Once again, they fail to make touch. That is diabolically inept from Ireland. 58 min New Zealand 29-0 Ireland Scrum for Ireland just inside their own half for a New Zealand knock on. Not for the first time in this game, Conor Murray gets a lecture from Nigel Owens about the manner in which he is appealing for decisions to go his way. 56 min New Zealand 29-0 Ireland Brody Retallick is penalised for going off his feet and Ireland clear their lines. Matt Todd and Rhys Ruddock come off their respective benches. 54 min New Zealand 29-0 Ireland New Zealand rampage forward again, playing the ball out wide to George Bridge on the touchline, seven or eight yards from the Ireland line. They move it back inside and Ireland are defending their own line again. 53 min New Zealand 29-0 Ireland: Sonny Bill Williams comes on for Jack Goodhue, whose lucky mullet has served him well today. He\u2019s been excellent for New Zealand, a pivotal ever-present menace as they stretch Ireland hither and yon across the pitch. 52 min New Zealand 29-0 Ireland: Ireland get into the New Zealand 22 for only the second time in the game and promptly give the ball away. They proceed to give away another penalty for a Tadhg Furlong tackle on a man without the ball. 50 min New Zealand 29-0 Ireland: New Zealand make front row changes, with Ofa Tuungafasi and Angus Ta\u2019avao coming on for Moody and Laualala. For Ireland, Dave Kilcoyne replaces Cian Healy. 48 min New Zealand 29-0 Ireland: Kieran Read drives for the line and is brought down. He pops the ball up to Taylor, who grabs the pass and drops between the posts. The conversion sails between the posts. New Zealand are so, so good ... 46 min New Zealand 22-0 Ireland: Kieran Read drives as New Zealand inch towards the Ireland line. Scott Barrett is next to put the head down and burrow. \u201cKeep your feet, please,\u201d says Nigel Owens to Ireland\u2019s forwards. We\u2019re on Phase Seven and Ireland are taking a ferocious pummelling. 46 min New Zealand 22-0 Ireland: Smith offloads to Goodhue after a good carry from Brodie Retallick. A knock on by CJ Stander give New Zealand the scrum and there\u2019s a break in play as New Zealand prop Joe Moody receives medical attention. Scrum for New Zealand about eight metres from the Irish line. 44 min New Zealand 22-0 Ireland: Ireland have a 22 drop out and New Zealand claim Johnny Sexton\u2019s kick. They play the ball from one touchline to the other, with Jack Goodhue making ground. They are on complete control of this match. 42 min New Zealand 22-0 Ireland: Scott Barrett is on for New Zealand and Ireland are already pinned back inside their own half. They have the scrum, about 10 metres from their own line. Conor Murray kicks for touch and New Zealand win the lineout. 41 min: \u201cIreland need to create a little bit of quicker ruck balls ... they\u2019re running into a brick wall at the moment,\u201d says Brian O\u2019Driscoll in the ITV studio. They missed 10 out of 66 tackles in that first half. New Zealand missed one out of 75. They kick off and Beauden Barrett catches the ball. He kicks for touch and Jacob Stockdale catches. He has a foot in touch and that\u2019s another silly Irish error ... Gerard Lyne is not happy: \u201cJust nine properly competitive rugby playing nations, nine World Cups and Ireland have never got past the quarter finals,\u201d he writes. \u201cAlso-rans, never nearly men. Overhyped. Over glorification of meaningless Soldier Field wins. Time to wind in the hype machine. It\u2019s Demolition Day. Again.\u201d It\u2019s only half-time, Gerard. Anything could happen ... although I have a feeling I know what\u2019s about to unfold. Some half-time reading: The players go off at half-time with Ireland having had the collective backside handed to them in a first half in which they had only one meaningful trip past the New Zealand 22. The reigning champions have been outstanding and for all their pre-match talk, Ireland have been pretty poor. 40+2 min New Zealand 22-0 Ireland: Ireland get a penalty, which is reversed because Peter O\u2019Mahony is penalised for leading a tackle with his shoulder on a man who was on the ground. 40+2 min New Zealand 22-0 Ireland: Excellent defence from New Zealand, but Ireland have another penalty for a tackle off the ball by Kieran Read. Nigel Owens is also checking a bad tackle by Peter O\u2019Mahony, who he suspects of leading with his shoulder on a player on the ground. 40+1 min New Zealand 22-0 Ireland: Ireland win a penalty as Sam Whitlock goes off his feet. Johnny Sexton kicks for touch in the corner and Ireland win the lineout. 40 min New Zealand 22-0 Ireland: Ireland win the lineout and are driven backwards as the half-time gong goes. Ireland are in possession a few metres from the New Zealand 22. This is actually as close as they\u2019ve come to scoring a try. 40 min New Zealand 22-0 Ireland: Conor Murray kicks for touch and wins his team the lineout after the ball goes out off Mo\u2019unga. 37 min New Zealand 22-0 Ireland: New Zealand go about their hunt for try No4. Ireland scrum after some indiscretion in the ruck perpetrated by Kieran Read. 33 min New Zealand 22-0 Ireland: Nigel Owens awards the try after a long consultation with Graham Hughes. Richie Mo\u2019unga misses the conversion from out wide by the right touchline. 32 min New Zealand 22-0 Ireland: A bruising tackle on Sexton from Reece prompts the Irishman to lose the ball. Barrett kicks the ball ahead, gathers and goes over. The TMO is checking to see if Barrett was offside when he kicked the ball. 31 min New Zealand 17-0 Ireland: Ireland lineout just inside the New Zealand half. They\u2019ve had just 38% in this game thus far. 29 min New Zealand 17-0 Ireland: In possession, Ireland struggle to get the ball out of their own 22. Murray kicks long to Beauden Barrett, who immediately plays it wide to Sevu Reece. 28 min: New Zealand 17-0 Ireland: New Zealand are in possession on the Ireland 22 going through seven ... eight ... nine... phases. Ardie Savia is penalised for knocking on. Ireland\u2019s forwards are going to be exhausted, what with New Zealand toying with them ... constantly forcing them from one side of the pitch to the other as they play the ball out to wide areas. New Zealand have been outstanding thus far. Ireland have been anything but, but are not doing themselves any favours. 26 min New Zealand 17-0 Ireland: New Zealand turn the ball over and Beauden Barrett scurries forward. Cian Healy is penalised for stealing the ball from a ruck. \u201cIt was still in the zone,\u201d says Nigel Owens, the referee. 24 min New Zealand 17-0 Ireland: Relentless New Zealand pressure as Ireland try to hang on. They have a moment of respite as they win a penalty and kick for touch around the New Zealand 22. 23 min New Zealand 17-0 Ireland: A penalty for New Zealand as Ringrose tackles Sevu Reece around the neck. This has the makings of a slaughter if Ireland can\u2019t cut out the ill discipline and silly mistakes. They\u2019re struggling to get out of their own half. 18 min New Zealand 17-0 Ireland: Ireland lineout. It\u2019s sloppy and Tadhg Furlong ends up knocking on. Scrum for New Zealand. The ball\u2019s played out the line from Jack Goodhue to Sevue Reece who gallops to the corner. He\u2019s tackled, a ruck forms and Aaron Smith goes over in the corner for his second try. A stupid mistake by Ireland at their own lineout is punished mercilessly. Richie Mo\u2019unga scores the conversion. 16 min New Zealand 10-0 Ireland: Just 16 minutes in and Ireland are in possession on the halfway line. Robbie Henshaw goes to ground and then James Ryan carries for five or six metres. Penalty advantage for Ireland as Codie Taylor is penalised for tackling Ryan without the ball. Johnny Sexton goes for distance elects to kick for touch in the corner but fails to make it. That\u2019s not good. 14 min New Zealand 10-0 Ireland: That\u2019s been coming. After relentless New Zealand pressure through phase after phase five metres from the Ireland line, Aaron Smith spots a gap, scuttles through and grounds the ball just beside the posts. Mo\u2019unga adds the extras. 13 min New Zealand 3-0 Ireland: Kearney cleans up at the back for Ireland as Mo\u2019unga plays a little grubber kick to the corner for George Bridge to chase. Ireland remain under the cosh, deep inside their own half. 11 min New Zealand 3-0 Ireland: New Zealand pay it out wide, with Beauden Barrett passing it to Sevu Reece. New Zealand are on the Ireland 22 and playing it over and back across the field, stretching the Ireland defence. 9 min New Zealand 3-0 Ireland: Garry Ringrose returns to action with his head bandaged and Jordan Lamour makes way. Ardie Savea is penalised for collapsing a maul and Johnny Sexton finds touch with the clearance. Ireland are under pressure here. Scrum for the All Blacks just inside the Ireland half. 7 min New Zealand 3-0 Ireland: Rob Kearney drops the ball deep in New Zealand territory andthe loose ball is booted forward by Goodhue, who gives chase. In the ensuing ruck, Conor Murray\u2019s attempted clearance is blocked. 6 min New Zealand 3-0 Ireland: Richie Mo\u2019unga makes no mistake with his first kick at goal and New Zealand have the lead. 5 min New Zealand 0-0 Ireland: Another break in play for treatment for a head injury sustained by Garry Ringrose. He\u2019s off to the blood bin and Jordan Lamour replaces him. New Zealand have a chance to open the scoring after Jacob Stockdale is penalised for deliberate, one-handed knock on as he tried to intercept. 4 min New Zealand 0-0 Ireland: After a brief break in play for treatment to a Sam Whitelock knee injury, New Zealand win a scrum inside their own half. The ball is kicked high by Richie Mo\u2019unga and Garry Ringrose is unable to claim it. New Zealand have the ball halfway inside the Irish half. 2 min New Zealand 0-0 Ireland: Rob Kearney fields a dinked kick from Jack Goodhue and Ireland have a lineout, which is claimed by Peter O\u2019Mahony. Ireland are on the front foot, but New Zealand turn it over in the maul after good work from Kieran Read. 1 min: The crowd count down and New Zealand kick off, with Richie Mo\u2019unga doing the honours. Scrum to Ireland after a New Zealand knock on, halfway inside the Irish half. And the haka ... Ireland\u2019s players stand inside their own half, lined out with their arms around each others shoulders, as New Zealand\u2019s players form an arrowhead and perform their customary pre-match ritual. In the stands, Ireland\u2019s supporters \u2013 who appear to vastly outnumber their New Zealand counterparts \u2013 attempt to drown it out with a rendition of The Fields Of Athenry. A minute\u2019s silence: There\u2019s a pause for reflection in memory of those who lost their lives as a result of last weekend\u2019s Typhon Hagibis. Now, the anthems ... Not long now: The teams are coming out of their dressing rooms and making their way to the tunnel. With New Zealand led by Kieran Read and Ireland by Rory Best, they\u2019re about to walk out into a cauldron. Off they go ... Joe Schmidt speaks: Talking to ITV, the Irish coach says it would be \u201ca dream come true\u201d to beat New Zealand. He pays tribute to his players, who he says have \u201cworked so hard\u201d. He goes on to say that he thinks Ireland will have to be calm and play better than they did in victory over New Zealand last November. \u201cWhen you\u2019re a team who can\u2019t see the wood for the trees, New Zealand love that.\u201d Steve Hansen and Joe Schmidt: There can be only winner today and following the post-match niceties and press conferences, the coach of either New Zealand or Ireland will be out of a job. Both Steve Hansen and Joe Schmidt have promised to step down once their team\u2019s interest in this Rugby World Cup has ended. Ireland captain Rory Best has also stated his intention to retire at the end of this tournament, so this could be his last game of rugby. England through to the semi-finals: England\u2019s quarter-final win over Australia could scarcely have been more emphatic and they will play the winners of this game in the last four. Robert Kitson was at Oita Stadium to see them advance. Ireland team news: Ireland are almost at full strength, although with Bundee Aki suspended, Joe Schmidt has picked Garry Ringrose as outside centre. New Zealand team news: \u201cThe forecast here is for rain on Saturday, but Hansen has picked a team to attack Ireland out wide,\u201d writes Paul Rees from Tokyo. \u201cThe wings George Bridge and Sevu Reece have 12 caps between them, the centre Jack Goodhue 11 and Richie Mo\u2019unga, who continues at fly\u2011half with Beauden Barrett the second playmaker at full-back, 14. The experienced Ben Smith and Ryan Crotty did not even make the bench, which is where Sonny Bill Williams will sit.\u201d Today\u2019s match officials Referee: Nigel Owens (Wales) Assistant: Pascal Gauzere (France) Assistant: Angus Gardner (Australia) TMO: Graham Hughes (England) New Zealand: B Barrett; Reece, Goodhue, Lienert-Brown, Bridge; Mo\u2019unga, Smith; Moody, Taylor, Laulala, Retallick, Whitelock; Savea, Cane, Reid. Replacements: Coles, Tuungafasi, Ta\u2019avao, S Barrett, Todd, Perenara, Williams, J Barrett. Ireland: Kearney; Earls, Ringrose, Henshaw, Stockdale; Sexton, Murray; Healy, Best, Furlong, Henderson, James Ryan, O\u2019Mahony; Van der Flier, Stander. Replacements: Scannell, Kilcoyne, Porter, Beirne, Ruddock, McGrath, Carbery, Larmour. Tokyo Stadium is the venue for a quarter-final between the tournament favourites and a team that has beaten them twice in Autumn internationals over the past three years. In beating New Zealand in Soldier\u2019s Field, Chicago in 2016, Ireland broke a hoodoo that had lasted 111 years, while their victory against the same opposition in Dublin last November prompted quite a few Irishmen to lose the run of themselves altogether and decide their team was going going to win the World Cup. For the Irish (and this minute-by-minute commentator ought to declare he is typing this report with knobbly stick-waving pigs under each arm), today is something of a reckoning. Somewhat remarkably, they have never won a Rugby World Cup knockout game and today in Tokyo is as good a time as any for them to \u2013 pardon my French but I feel very strongly about this \u2013 shit or get off the pot. Kick-off is at 11.15am (BST), but other time zones are available and we\u2019d be delighted to have your company wherever you might be.",

      "body": "<p><em>Arthur (Or The Decline And Fall Of The British Empire)</em> is a courageous concept album, about both personal loss and the loss of imperial identity after the second world war. But when it came out in 1969 the record industry did not know what to do with it, despite reviews in the music press saluting a creative masterpiece.</p> <p>This autumn the Kinks\u2019 lyrical story of an ordinary man caught up in a time of great national change has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/oct/06/the-kinks-album-arthur-to-be-turned-into-bbc-radio-drama\" title=\"\">turned into a BBC Radio 4 show</a>, broadcast next month.

By sheer coincidence, it resonates more now that it did then,\u201d he told the <em>Observer</em>. The struggles and uncertainty of the postwar era are matched, he believes, by the current search for what it means to be English or British.</p> <p>\u201cToday, I feel we have got a similar atmosphere. To be fairly critical, looking back at the 60s, I think we blew it,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a generation that made great art, but the politics and the country was falling apart.\u201d</p> <p>Davies, 75, describes the album as a \u201cpop documentary\u201d rather than a \u201cpop opera\u201d.

Another generation up,\u201d said Davies. \u201cBut anyway there was a falling out between the producer and the director and Granada TV. Words were said to the effect of \u2018If I don\u2019t get what I want I\u2019m walking.\u2019 And they said, \u2018Go ahead.\u2019\u2009\u201d</p> <p>The playwright Julian Mitchell had written a script, inspired by the life of Davies\u2019s brother-in-law, and Davies wrote 12 accompanying songs.</p> <p>\u201cAs an album it is a signpost of where the Kinks were going,\u201d said Davies. \u201cWe stopped being a pop band with the album <em>The Kinks Are The Village Green Preservation Society</em> the year before, which was a homage to my spiritual or fantasy world. Then, with <em>Arthur</em>, I turned back to reality. I wanted to write about England, damn it. And so I stood my ground after <em>Village Green</em> failed commercially, if not artistically. I was quite stubborn and I\u2019m still quite stubborn.\u201d</p> <p>The tracks were not all designed for release as singles and some space for longer guitar solos was \u201cnegotiated\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t really win any battles with the record company. You never do. They say they\u2019ll do something, then they bend your arm and do what they want. So I just thought I would make the record I want to make,\u201d said Davies.</p> <p>The hour-long radio version, together with a longer stage show, has been adapted in collaboration with the playwright and musician Paul Sirett, with whom Davies wrote the show <em>Come Dancing</em>.</p> <p>The cast includes Lee Ross as Arthur, Davies\u2019s real-life brother-in-law, and Rosie Cavaliero as his beloved elder sister, Rose, and there are key songs from the original album, along with other Kinks\u2019 hits Waterloo Sunset and You Really Got Me. It is also likely to come to the stage as a musical in the new year.</p> <p>\u201cIt is a play set 50 years ago that is about now,\u201d said Sirett, adding: \u201cRay is a very important English voice. He can still tell us things we haven\u2019t even spotted about ourselves.\u201d</p> <p>The Davies brothers were born into a large, close-knit family in north London and suffered poverty and bereavement before they achieved fame. Their eldest sister, Rene, a dance hall star, had died suddenly when Ray was 13.</p> <p>\u201cIt is a more emotional album for me than <em>Village Green</em>, as it is based on my own family,\u201d said Davies. \u201cArthur and Rose were a surrogate father and mother to me. Arthur didn\u2019t know the word \u2018mentor\u2019 and didn\u2019t know that\u2019s what he was. He was disciplined after his time in the army and it was character-building for me. He thought I was an annoying little bastard but we really missed them. Yet if Arthur had not left for Australia, my brother and I might not have formed the band. He wanted me to get a job and I would have stayed at art school for longer.\u201d</p> <p>The remastered re-release of the original album includes extra tracks that show the genesis of the key musical themes. It also features the solo music that Dave Davies, the band\u2019s lead guitarist, was making at the same time.</p> <p>\u201cI wanted to put out a balanced overview,\u201d said Ray Davies. The brothers notoriously fought throughout the latter part of their careers, but things are on the mend. The inclusion of his brother\u2019s tracks from a solo album that was never released is a sign they are now, as Davies has admitted, if not exactly back together again, then at least \u201cback to our dysfunction\u201d.</p> <p>The Kinks\u2019 musical mood has been called nostalgic, but Davies isn\u2019t keen on the word. He prefers \u201cremembrance\u201d or \u201cmelancholy\u201d and also points out his hits All Day and All of the Night and You Really Got Me hardly fit this bill. He does concede though that the sadnesses of his youth \u201cmay have had an effect\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI was traumatised by Rene\u2019s death,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I was a kid if you had an issue you kept quiet about it. There was shame. So I didn\u2019t sit down and say I am going to write a melancholy theme. I was sensitive and couldn\u2019t express myself. Then I found music and the outpouring began. I\u2019ll never stop writing because I think of tunes incessantly \u2013 it bugs me. They come into my head \u2013 literally voices in my head.\u201d</p> <p>When the Kinks toured Australia in 1971, Davies met up again backstage with his brother-in-law Arthur. \u201cHe told me he liked my work and that he knew I had written about him,\u201d said Davies. \u201cThe overall impression I got was that the trip out to Australia was a success, although Rose didn\u2019t want to go.\u201d</p>",

The inclusion of his brother\u2019s tracks from a solo album that was never released is a sign they are now, as Davies has admitted, if not exactly back together again, then at least \u201cback to our dysfunction\u201d. The Kinks\u2019 musical mood has been called nostalgic, but Davies isn\u2019t keen on the word. He prefers \u201cremembrance\u201d or \u201cmelancholy\u201d and also points out his hits All Day and All of the Night and You Really Got Me hardly fit this bill. He does concede though that the sadnesses of his youth \u201cmay have had an effect\u201d. \u201cI was traumatised by Rene\u2019s death,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I was a kid if you had an issue you kept quiet about it. There was shame. So I didn\u2019t sit down and say I am going to write a melancholy theme. I was sensitive and couldn\u2019t express myself. Then I found music and the outpouring began. I\u2019ll never stop writing because I think of tunes incessantly \u2013 it bugs me. They come into my head \u2013 literally voices in my head.\u201d When the Kinks toured Australia in 1971, Davies met up again backstage with his brother-in-law Arthur. \u201cHe told me he liked my work and that he knew I had written about him,\u201d said Davies. \u201cThe overall impression I got was that the trip out to Australia was a success, although Rose didn\u2019t want to go.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The campaigning group <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ByDonkeys?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\" title=\"\">Led By Donkeys</a> is always on the lookout for what it calls \u201cthermonuclear hypocrisy\u201d in politics, and specifically on Brexit. So when, in August, its founders belatedly came across an article that Michael Gove had written for the <em>Daily Mail</em> in March 2019, they felt they had hit the jackpot. In it, Gove, who is now chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster \u2013 or more prosaically, the man charged with making Brexit happen, deal or no deal \u2013 had noted: \u201cWe didn\u2019t vote to leave without a deal. That wasn\u2019t the message of the campaign I helped lead.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt was like, \u2018Hang on a second: that should be the iceberg to the government\u2019s no-deal Titanic,\u2019\u201d exclaims 45-year-old Ben Stewart, one of the four founders of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/25/led-by-donkeys-reveal-identities-brexit-billboards-posters\" title=\"\">Led By Donkeys</a>. \u201cThe leader of the campaign, the person charged with no-deal planning has said there is no mandate for this. And now they <em>are</em> claiming a mandate for it. So I felt and we all felt: we need to make that quote famous.\u201d</p> <p>Led By Donkeys, which came into existence only in January, had already had considerable success, and a lot of fun, reminding politicians of words they have said, written or tweeted, and probably wished they hadn\u2019t. The project started with blowing up tweets \u2013 from the likes of <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-47801288\" title=\"\">David Cameron</a> and Leave tub-thumpers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/16/billboard-campaign-reminds-voters-of-mps-brexit-promises\" title=\"\">Jacob Rees-Mogg</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/19/led-by-donkeys-billboards-nigel-farage-ann-widdecombe\" title=\"\">Nigel Farage</a> \u2013 and slapping them on billboards in the dead of night. But the group quickly became more ambitious and its work has appeared everywhere from a <a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/?q=People%27s+Vote+London+in+March+led+by+donkeys+banner&amp;iar=images&amp;iax=images&amp;ia=images&amp;iai=https%3A%2F%2Fwordpress.mediatel.co.uk%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2019%2F04%2Fled-by-donkeys.png\" title=\"\">40m x 20m banner</a> at the People\u2019s Vote demonstration in London in March to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bydonkeys/status/1113827097930280960\" title=\"\">projections on the cliffs of Dover</a>. Their targets are overwhelmingly on the right of the political spectrum, though Jeremy Corbyn was mocked with a <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/poster-campaign-challenges-jeremy-corbyn-to-back-a-peoples-vote_uk_5c62a328e4b0ffd8515df4c2\" title=\"\">billboard</a> that had his Twitter handle but was otherwise left blank, so that people could write on to it what they would like the Labour leader to say on the issue.</p> <p>Its work has been, to some camps, the Remain campaign that never was: impassioned, humorous, compelling. Through more than 50 poster designs, photographs of which have had more than 200m views on social media, Led By Donkeys has taken the fight to the flip-flopping Brexiters. They have also taken potshots at Donald Trump and what they consider the dangers of post-truth politics. When the US president visited the UK in June, they <a href=\"https://www.euronews.com/2019/06/04/led-by-donkeys-billboard-crusaders-launch-campaign-in-london-during-trump-visit\" title=\"\">projected his approval ratings</a> (and those of Barack Obama) on to the Tower of London, and a video in which Boris Johnson called Trump out for \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theneweuropean.co.uk/top-stories/boris-johnson-s-comments-on-donald-trump-1-6084635\" title=\"\">quite stupefying ignorance</a>\u201d was superimposed on to Big Ben. In the US, these stunts were picked up by Stephen Colbert on <em>The Late Show </em>and Rachel Maddow on MSNBC. Just last week, Led By Donkeys launched <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/12/brexit-the-horror-film-billboards-mock-governments-get-ready-campaign-led-by-donkeys\" title=\"\">posters</a> satirising the government\u2019s Get Ready for Brexit campaign, designed by members of the public, and, as this article went to press, were finalising plans for Saturday\u2019s People\u2019s Vote march.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"23f8218a2d8db42c5ad07a2baf1c519ddcd99815\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/23f8218a2d8db42c5ad07a2baf1c519ddcd99815/0_212_5760_3249/1000.jpg\" alt=\"One of Led By Donkeys\u2019 first billboards, in Leeds, January 2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"564\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of Led By Donkeys\u2019 first billboards, in Leeds, January 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Morgan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Back in the summer, as Boris Johnson pushed more insistently for a no-deal Brexit, Led By Donkeys decided its Michael Gove quote needed a special treatment, eventually settling on a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/01/visible-from-space-gove-portrait-appears-on-beach-in-brexit-protest\" title=\"\">sand sculpture</a> of his words for Redcar beach in Teeside. Redcar was chosen because, for one thing, it has a massive beach, but also because analysis suggests that the north-east will be profoundly affected by leaving the EU without a deal, especially up the coast in Sunderland, home of Nissan, the UK\u2019s biggest car plant. On 1 September, Gove\u2019s face and his comment (\u201cWe didn\u2019t vote to leave without a deal\u201d) were carved into the sand in ginormous letters, covering around 7,500 square metres of the beach.</p> <p>Stewart smiles. \u201cSo it\u2019s like: \u2018Oh well, if Michael Gove thinks he can take us out without a deal he needs to own what he said on a sand sculpture visible from space.\u2019 And he saw it, because Sarah Vine, his wife, replied to our tweet saying: \u2018Wow, that\u2019s really impressive!\u2019 So that fucker saw it over the breakfast table and maybe he\u2019ll think twice before repeating that bullshit.\u201d</p> <p>It has been a wild, confounding and very busy few months for the Led By Donkeys team who, besides Stewart, are Oliver Knowles, 44, James Sadri and Will Rose, both 40. At the beginning of the year they were unknown; now they are one of the loudest voices in opposition to the government\u2019s Brexit policy. Drone footage of the Redcar sand installation has been watched 1.1m times.

The founders, anonymous initially, were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/25/led-by-donkeys-reveal-identities-brexit-billboards-posters\" title=\"\">\u201cunmasked\u201d</a> in May by the rightwing Guido Fawkes website. All four had worked at Greenpeace at one point \u2013 two of them still do \u2013 leading them to be described as \u201clefty environmentalists\u201d. For some, Led By Donkeys epitomises the \u201cRemoaner\u201d camp, preaching to other like-minded zealots (and hardly anyone else) mainly on social media. Certainly, it is not always clear how much damage their stinging attacks on Leave-promoting politicians are really inflicting. After skewering the March to Leave, and especially Farage\u2019s half-hearted involvement, Led By Donkeys was dismayed to watch the Brexit Party <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/27/nigel-farage-brexit-party-win-big-wake-up-call-westminster\" title=\"\">perform buoyantly</a> in the European elections in May, winning the highest share of the vote in nine of the 12 regions, and 32% overall.</p> <p>These criticisms, for the most part, miss the target, the Led By Donkeys founders think. They don\u2019t believe they can single-handedly bring down the government; in fact, they started the project for \u201ccatharsis\u201d: they could either laugh or cry \u2013 and they would rather laugh. And that\u2019s still true today.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/12/brexit-the-horror-film-billboards-mock-governments-get-ready-campaign-led-by-donkeys\">Brexit the horror film: billboards mock government's 'get ready' campaign</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cYou just have to laugh with this massive shitshow going on,\u201d says Stewart. \u201cWe have this unifying thing where we do laugh at Gove and Cummings and Fox and Johnson and I hope that comes out through the project. And there is a political power in laughing at these people.\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s not to say, though, that there isn\u2019t serious intent behind the project. \u201cAt the moment, we\u2019re thinking, \u2018Can we stop Brexit happening on 31 October?\u2019\u201d says Stewart. \u201cLook, we alone are not going to do it, but what is our tiny, tiny role in that effort?\u201d</p> <p>Blue or red, Leave or Remain, the rise of Led By Donkeys is an entertaining caper that often slides into farce, and it\u2019s told with vim in a new book by the founders, <em>Led By Donkeys: How Four Friends </em><em>With a Ladder Took on Brexit</em>. The broad aims of the project were conceived in a pub, the Birdcage in Stoke Newington, north London, last December. Much has been made of the founders\u2019 connection to Greenpeace, but the make-up of the group was as random as nights out often are. \u201cIt just happened to be us four in the pub that night. It could have been five of us, or us two with two others,\u201d says Stewart.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f5a885d2f3bb57f60b2937182aa6a050d8e3182d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f5a885d2f3bb57f60b2937182aa6a050d8e3182d/0_0_3500_2334/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Jacob Rees Mogg billboard in London, September.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Jacob Rees Mogg billboard in London, September.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Mirzoeff/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The camaraderie between the four is clear when we meet this month at a cafe in north London. Stewart, Greenpeace\u2019s deputy programme director, speaks the most, and the most bluntly, while Knowles comes across as clear and concise, a moral anchor for the group. Sadri, whose background is in human rights and the Middle East, cuts through any pomposity that might creep in and runs the digital side of the operation, while Rose \u2013 who today has just arrived, on next to no sleep, from Sweden, where he lives \u2013 is a photographer and often designs the Led By Donkeys posters.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/13/brexit-remain-radicalisation-fbpe-peoples-vote\">\u2018Loud, obsessive, tribal\u2019: the radicalisation of remain</a> </p> </aside>  <p>No one remembers who first thought of doing quotes on billboards, but there was unanimous agreement that the initial target should be David Cameron and his evergreen 2015 line: \u201cBritain faces a simple and inescapable choice \u2013 stability and strong government with me, or chaos with Ed Miliband.\u201d They ordered the posters and Sadri came up with a name for the group, a riff on \u201clions led by the donkeys\u201d, the phrase used in the first world war to describe the tragedy of the British footsoldiers led to slaughter by incompetent or stupid generals. When it came to putting up the first billboard in January, by the A10 in Stamford Hill, close to the Birdcage, the job fell to Knowles and Stewart, who both live in the area.</p> <p>The team didn\u2019t have the money to pay for the billboard, so they decided to requisition one. This, of course, is illegal: criminal damage at the very least. All four men had, in their activist pasts, had skirmishes with police, specifically campaigning on the climate crisis and against the Iraq war, and they knew their actions could result in them being arrested. As Stewart explains: \u201cWe come from a political culture that is comfortable with civil disobedience and thinks that civil disobedience has got us a lot of the freedoms we\u2019ve got, and, speaking personally, isn\u2019t that bothered by getting a conviction.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt felt important to do something that was more than just writing a letter of concern or protest,\u201d adds Sadri. \u201cIt feels like this is such a momentous political moment that there should be more people out there prepared to do a little bit more to stop this calamitous thing from happening. So this was a very modest and small way of personally doing something.\u201d</p> <p>Putting up a billboard poster, it turns out, is a skilled task. \u201cIt very nearly didn\u2019t continue as a project,\u201d says Knowles, the man up the \u00a390 B&amp;Q ladder that night. \u201cWe were covered in paste, couldn\u2019t get the poster up and people were stopping in their cars and looking at us and laughing. So for a moment, it didn\u2019t feel like it was going anywhere.\u201d</p> <p>A little too amateurish perhaps?</p> <p>Stewart bristles a little. \u201cI would describe it as guerrilla-style,\u201d he smiles, then relents. \u201cNo, it was amateurish. Sheet one of poster one was nearly the sum total of this project. But we got that fucker up! And it just developed from there.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"502110e277c415b894fbeeaa1d160e705f45f62e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/502110e277c415b894fbeeaa1d160e705f45f62e/0_0_4912_7192/683.jpg\" alt=\"Led By Donkeys\" width=\"683\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We\u2019re increasingly passionate about is finding people outside the remain camp.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phil Fisk/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The plan was always to combine the analogue \u2013 billboards \u2013 with the digital: taking photographs and videos of people interacting with the work and posting them on their social media channels. So after the Cameron poster went up, Stewart contacted the<em> Guardian</em> columnist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/marinahyde\" title=\"\">Marina Hyde</a> through Twitter. She retweeted the image, and within minutes Led By Donkeys had hundreds of followers and interview requests had begun to come in; there was a special frisson among the four when Gary Kemp from Spandau Ballet started following them.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know anything about it at all,\u201d remembers Hyde, \u201cbut as soon as I saw their first billboard I thought it was so striking and funny. It\u2019s so rare to see a sense of pisstake in any political campaigning. I just thought it was a great, simple, modern idea \u2013 one of the few things on what I suppose you\u2019d call the Remain side to try and elicit an emotional response. It definitely shits on another \u2018letter to the Times from 100 businessmen\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Led By Donkeys describes what it does as \u201cpolitical theatre\u201d and it\u2019s most effective when, whether it\u2019s a physical billboard or the <em>Angel of the North</em>, you can\u2019t just thumb past it on your smartphone. \u201cPeople talk about how the problems in today\u2019s world are because we live in these little echo chambers, all talking to ourselves, and Twitter is one of the worst culprits of that culture,\u201d says Sadri. \u201cSo there\u2019s something about taking a politician\u2019s tweet \u2013 something that flies past you at a million miles per hour \u2013 and slapping it on this massive, wooden, 100-year-old structure in the middle of somebody\u2019s neighbourhood that breaks that, and says: \u2018We have to look at that if it\u2019s a sunny day, if it\u2019s pissing with rain.\u2019 And it gives you time to digest it if you\u2019re sitting at a bus stop or talking to your neighbours.\u201d</p> <p>The \u201canarchic, guerrilla\u201d phase of Led By Donkeys actually lasted for little more than a week, but took in cover-of-darkness assignments to Romford, which voted 70% Leave, and Dover where, their pasting skills improving, they covered four sites in a night. But life was becoming increasingly complicated at work and home \u2013 all four have two young children each \u2013 and when the idea of crowdfunding to rent billboard space came up, they decided to dip a toe in. Not only would it make them legit, but it would allow Led By Donkeys posters to cover the entire country, not just towns that could be reached at night and get them home for the morning school run. They set a target of \u00a310,000, which they hit in three hours; by the end of the day they had raised \u00a330,000. The total now is over \u00a3600,000.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/01/visible-from-space-gove-portrait-appears-on-beach-in-brexit-protest\">Gove portrait 'visible from space' drawn on beach in Brexit protest</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Going straight hasn\u2019t always been easy for Led By Donkeys: there was clearly a thrill to dodging police and furious Leavers, which was heightened by being anonymous and sometimes overhearing friends or colleagues talking about their latest stunt, without having a clue that they were involved.</p> <p>\u201cI did a lot of activism when I was younger and then I settled down, mortgage, kids,\u201d says Stewart. \u201cSo suddenly finding myself with Olly out on a ladder, doing something that was actually illegal but you really believed in it, was something I hadn\u2019t done for eight or nine years. And there was something beautiful for us about doing it with friends, not doing it as part of a big group or organisation.\u201d</p> <p>Still, even if they are \u201cmired in Excel spreadsheets\u201d now, there are clear upsides. From the beginning, Led By Donkeys had been conscious it could be accused of only existing in a bubble, but now it has the resources to reach a much wider audience.

      "bodyText": "The campaigning group Led By Donkeys is always on the lookout for what it calls \u201cthermonuclear hypocrisy\u201d in politics, and specifically on Brexit. So when, in August, its founders belatedly came across an article that Michael Gove had written for the Daily Mail in March 2019, they felt they had hit the jackpot. In it, Gove, who is now chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster \u2013 or more prosaically, the man charged with making Brexit happen, deal or no deal \u2013 had noted: \u201cWe didn\u2019t vote to leave without a deal. That wasn\u2019t the message of the campaign I helped lead.\u201d \u201cIt was like, \u2018Hang on a second: that should be the iceberg to the government\u2019s no-deal Titanic,\u2019\u201d exclaims 45-year-old Ben Stewart, one of the four founders of Led By Donkeys. \u201cThe leader of the campaign, the person charged with no-deal planning has said there is no mandate for this. And now they are claiming a mandate for it. So I felt and we all felt: we need to make that quote famous.\u201d Led By Donkeys, which came into existence only in January, had already had considerable success, and a lot of fun, reminding politicians of words they have said, written or tweeted, and probably wished they hadn\u2019t. The project started with blowing up tweets \u2013 from the likes of David Cameron and Leave tub-thumpers Jacob Rees-Mogg and Nigel Farage \u2013 and slapping them on billboards in the dead of night. But the group quickly became more ambitious and its work has appeared everywhere from a 40m x 20m banner at the People\u2019s Vote demonstration in London in March to projections on the cliffs of Dover. Their targets are overwhelmingly on the right of the political spectrum, though Jeremy Corbyn was mocked with a billboard that had his Twitter handle but was otherwise left blank, so that people could write on to it what they would like the Labour leader to say on the issue. Its work has been, to some camps, the Remain campaign that never was: impassioned, humorous, compelling. Through more than 50 poster designs, photographs of which have had more than 200m views on social media, Led By Donkeys has taken the fight to the flip-flopping Brexiters. They have also taken potshots at Donald Trump and what they consider the dangers of post-truth politics. When the US president visited the UK in June, they projected his approval ratings (and those of Barack Obama) on to the Tower of London, and a video in which Boris Johnson called Trump out for \u201cquite stupefying ignorance\u201d was superimposed on to Big Ben. In the US, these stunts were picked up by Stephen Colbert on The Late Show and Rachel Maddow on MSNBC. Just last week, Led By Donkeys launched posters satirising the government\u2019s Get Ready for Brexit campaign, designed by members of the public, and, as this article went to press, were finalising plans for Saturday\u2019s People\u2019s Vote march. Back in the summer, as Boris Johnson pushed more insistently for a no-deal Brexit, Led By Donkeys decided its Michael Gove quote needed a special treatment, eventually settling on a sand sculpture of his words for Redcar beach in Teeside. Redcar was chosen because, for one thing, it has a massive beach, but also because analysis suggests that the north-east will be profoundly affected by leaving the EU without a deal, especially up the coast in Sunderland, home of Nissan, the UK\u2019s biggest car plant. On 1 September, Gove\u2019s face and his comment (\u201cWe didn\u2019t vote to leave without a deal\u201d) were carved into the sand in ginormous letters, covering around 7,500 square metres of the beach. Stewart smiles. \u201cSo it\u2019s like: \u2018Oh well, if Michael Gove thinks he can take us out without a deal he needs to own what he said on a sand sculpture visible from space.\u2019 And he saw it, because Sarah Vine, his wife, replied to our tweet saying: \u2018Wow, that\u2019s really impressive!\u2019 So that fucker saw it over the breakfast table and maybe he\u2019ll think twice before repeating that bullshit.\u201d It has been a wild, confounding and very busy few months for the Led By Donkeys team who, besides Stewart, are Oliver Knowles, 44, James Sadri and Will Rose, both 40. At the beginning of the year they were unknown; now they are one of the loudest voices in opposition to the government\u2019s Brexit policy. Drone footage of the Redcar sand installation has been watched 1.1m times. The Led By Donkeys coverage of the pro-Brexit march in March \u2013 which took the form of regular updates to their 300,000 Twitter followers, long after the media pack had departed \u2013 was perhaps primarily responsible for revealing it as a lacklustre, poorly attended shambles. Yet, while the Led By Donkeys team are heroes to many who would like a second referendum, their work is not universally adored. The founders, anonymous initially, were \u201cunmasked\u201d in May by the rightwing Guido Fawkes website. All four had worked at Greenpeace at one point \u2013 two of them still do \u2013 leading them to be described as \u201clefty environmentalists\u201d. For some, Led By Donkeys epitomises the \u201cRemoaner\u201d camp, preaching to other like-minded zealots (and hardly anyone else) mainly on social media. Certainly, it is not always clear how much damage their stinging attacks on Leave-promoting politicians are really inflicting. After skewering the March to Leave, and especially Farage\u2019s half-hearted involvement, Led By Donkeys was dismayed to watch the Brexit Party perform buoyantly in the European elections in May, winning the highest share of the vote in nine of the 12 regions, and 32% overall. These criticisms, for the most part, miss the target, the Led By Donkeys founders think. They don\u2019t believe they can single-handedly bring down the government; in fact, they started the project for \u201ccatharsis\u201d: they could either laugh or cry \u2013 and they would rather laugh. And that\u2019s still true today. \u201cYou just have to laugh with this massive shitshow going on,\u201d says Stewart. \u201cWe have this unifying thing where we do laugh at Gove and Cummings and Fox and Johnson and I hope that comes out through the project. And there is a political power in laughing at these people.\u201d That\u2019s not to say, though, that there isn\u2019t serious intent behind the project. \u201cAt the moment, we\u2019re thinking, \u2018Can we stop Brexit happening on 31 October?\u2019\u201d says Stewart. \u201cLook, we alone are not going to do it, but what is our tiny, tiny role in that effort?\u201d Blue or red, Leave or Remain, the rise of Led By Donkeys is an entertaining caper that often slides into farce, and it\u2019s told with vim in a new book by the founders, Led By Donkeys: How Four Friends With a Ladder Took on Brexit. The broad aims of the project were conceived in a pub, the Birdcage in Stoke Newington, north London, last December. Much has been made of the founders\u2019 connection to Greenpeace, but the make-up of the group was as random as nights out often are. \u201cIt just happened to be us four in the pub that night. It could have been five of us, or us two with two others,\u201d says Stewart. The camaraderie between the four is clear when we meet this month at a cafe in north London. Stewart, Greenpeace\u2019s deputy programme director, speaks the most, and the most bluntly, while Knowles comes across as clear and concise, a moral anchor for the group. Sadri, whose background is in human rights and the Middle East, cuts through any pomposity that might creep in and runs the digital side of the operation, while Rose \u2013 who today has just arrived, on next to no sleep, from Sweden, where he lives \u2013 is a photographer and often designs the Led By Donkeys posters. No one remembers who first thought of doing quotes on billboards, but there was unanimous agreement that the initial target should be David Cameron and his evergreen 2015 line: \u201cBritain faces a simple and inescapable choice \u2013 stability and strong government with me, or chaos with Ed Miliband.\u201d They ordered the posters and Sadri came up with a name for the group, a riff on \u201clions led by the donkeys\u201d, the phrase used in the first world war to describe the tragedy of the British footsoldiers led to slaughter by incompetent or stupid generals. When it came to putting up the first billboard in January, by the A10 in Stamford Hill, close to the Birdcage, the job fell to Knowles and Stewart, who both live in the area. The team didn\u2019t have the money to pay for the billboard, so they decided to requisition one. This, of course, is illegal: criminal damage at the very least. All four men had, in their activist pasts, had skirmishes with police, specifically campaigning on the climate crisis and against the Iraq war, and they knew their actions could result in them being arrested. As Stewart explains: \u201cWe come from a political culture that is comfortable with civil disobedience and thinks that civil disobedience has got us a lot of the freedoms we\u2019ve got, and, speaking personally, isn\u2019t that bothered by getting a conviction.\u201d \u201cIt felt important to do something that was more than just writing a letter of concern or protest,\u201d adds Sadri. \u201cIt feels like this is such a momentous political moment that there should be more people out there prepared to do a little bit more to stop this calamitous thing from happening. So this was a very modest and small way of personally doing something.\u201d Putting up a billboard poster, it turns out, is a skilled task. \u201cIt very nearly didn\u2019t continue as a project,\u201d says Knowles, the man up the \u00a390 B&amp;Q ladder that night. \u201cWe were covered in paste, couldn\u2019t get the poster up and people were stopping in their cars and looking at us and laughing. So for a moment, it didn\u2019t feel like it was going anywhere.\u201d A little too amateurish perhaps? Stewart bristles a little. \u201cI would describe it as guerrilla-style,\u201d he smiles, then relents. \u201cNo, it was amateurish. Sheet one of poster one was nearly the sum total of this project. But we got that fucker up! And it just developed from there.\u201d The plan was always to combine the analogue \u2013 billboards \u2013 with the digital: taking photographs and videos of people interacting with the work and posting them on their social media channels. So after the Cameron poster went up, Stewart contacted the Guardian columnist Marina Hyde through Twitter. She retweeted the image, and within minutes Led By Donkeys had hundreds of followers and interview requests had begun to come in; there was a special frisson among the four when Gary Kemp from Spandau Ballet started following them. \u201cI didn\u2019t know anything about it at all,\u201d remembers Hyde, \u201cbut as soon as I saw their first billboard I thought it was so striking and funny. It\u2019s so rare to see a sense of pisstake in any political campaigning. I just thought it was a great, simple, modern idea \u2013 one of the few things on what I suppose you\u2019d call the Remain side to try and elicit an emotional response. It definitely shits on another \u2018letter to the Times from 100 businessmen\u2019.\u201d Led By Donkeys describes what it does as \u201cpolitical theatre\u201d and it\u2019s most effective when, whether it\u2019s a physical billboard or the Angel of the North, you can\u2019t just thumb past it on your smartphone. \u201cPeople talk about how the problems in today\u2019s world are because we live in these little echo chambers, all talking to ourselves, and Twitter is one of the worst culprits of that culture,\u201d says Sadri. \u201cSo there\u2019s something about taking a politician\u2019s tweet \u2013 something that flies past you at a million miles per hour \u2013 and slapping it on this massive, wooden, 100-year-old structure in the middle of somebody\u2019s neighbourhood that breaks that, and says: \u2018We have to look at that if it\u2019s a sunny day, if it\u2019s pissing with rain.\u2019 And it gives you time to digest it if you\u2019re sitting at a bus stop or talking to your neighbours.\u201d The \u201canarchic, guerrilla\u201d phase of Led By Donkeys actually lasted for little more than a week, but took in cover-of-darkness assignments to Romford, which voted 70% Leave, and Dover where, their pasting skills improving, they covered four sites in a night. But life was becoming increasingly complicated at work and home \u2013 all four have two young children each \u2013 and when the idea of crowdfunding to rent billboard space came up, they decided to dip a toe in. Not only would it make them legit, but it would allow Led By Donkeys posters to cover the entire country, not just towns that could be reached at night and get them home for the morning school run. They set a target of \u00a310,000, which they hit in three hours; by the end of the day they had raised \u00a330,000. The total now is over \u00a3600,000. Going straight hasn\u2019t always been easy for Led By Donkeys: there was clearly a thrill to dodging police and furious Leavers, which was heightened by being anonymous and sometimes overhearing friends or colleagues talking about their latest stunt, without having a clue that they were involved. \u201cI did a lot of activism when I was younger and then I settled down, mortgage, kids,\u201d says Stewart. \u201cSo suddenly finding myself with Olly out on a ladder, doing something that was actually illegal but you really believed in it, was something I hadn\u2019t done for eight or nine years. And there was something beautiful for us about doing it with friends, not doing it as part of a big group or organisation.\u201d Still, even if they are \u201cmired in Excel spreadsheets\u201d now, there are clear upsides. From the beginning, Led By Donkeys had been conscious it could be accused of only existing in a bubble, but now it has the resources to reach a much wider audience. There is satisfaction in getting 10,000 retweets from a post, but these days the founders insist they are more excited when their work is picked up by regional papers, sparking local debate. They also want their message to be heard beyond British borders: to that end, they have bought billboard space in Brussels and beamed \u201cSOS\u201d on an EU flag in a 75x50m projection on the Dover cliffs. \u201cQuite something to see the white cliffs of Dover turn blue,\u201d noted Guy Verhofstadt, the former Belgian prime minister and now the EU parliament\u2019s representative in the Brexit negotiations. \u201cWe have a project that definitely reaches Remainers, but what we\u2019re increasingly passionate about is finding people outside that camp,\u201d says Knowles. \u201cAnd our premise is that there\u2019s a lot of people who have changed their mind who aren\u2019t being heard at the moment. Can we find a way to talk to them and bring them into the discussion?\u201d The concepts can also become more outsized. \u201cBeing in Redcar,\u201d says Rose, \u201cwatching them draw it out on the sand and then seeing the drone go up and looking at the screen and seeing the message revealed \u2013 that was a different level of excitement.\u201d Alastair Campbell suggested that, if Brexit were to be averted, Led By Donkeys would deserve a special award as \u201csecret heroes\u201d of the campaign.

      "bodyText": "Why are workers\u2019 rights at stake in Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal? The PM\u2019s renegotiated deal opens the way to a much looser relationship with the EU than envisaged by his predecessor, Theresa May, and allows for more \u201cdivergence\u201d with EU regulations. As such, instead of writing into the legally binding withdrawal agreement that the UK will abide by EU standards on workers\u2019 rights and the environment, these \u201clevel playing field\u201d commitments have been shifted to the forward-looking political declaration. In practice, it will be up to the government that negotiates the free trade deal \u2013 most likely after a general election \u2013 to decide how strong a commitment to EU rules it is prepared to make. What promises is the government making to protect workers\u2019 rights? While labour rights \u2013 like a blizzard of other rules and regulations \u2013 would no longer be underpinned by EU law, the government has promised to write a series of commitments into the Withdrawal Act (the legislation implementing Brexit). On Friday night, the government announced that ministers would be obliged to make a statement each time any new law could affect employment rights, and say whether they would comply with EU standards. And the government would also report regularly on changes to EU standards and whether the UK planned to mirror them. MPs would then be given a vote on these reports, to approve or reject the government\u2019s plan. Ministers also pointed out that the government announced an employment reform bill in the Queen\u2019s speech that would increase standards, and insisted they had no intention of reducing standards. However, Labour\u2019s employment rights spokesperson, Laura Pidcock, insisted those pledges were not worth the paper they were written on \u2013 and Jeremy Corbyn claimed Johnson was \u201cfiring the starting gun on a race to the bottom\u201d. Johnson has also repeatedly stressed his insistence that while environmental standards will no longer be guaranteed by EU law, the UK will set higher standards, including in an environment bill, announced in this week\u2019s Queen\u2019s speech. What else might be up for grabs in future trade deals? According to Johnson in the debate on Saturday, not the NHS \u2013 which Labour fears could be opened up to exploitation by US corporations as part of a trade agreement with Donald Trump\u2019s White House. When he flew to the G7 summit in Biarritz in August, the PM outlined a long list of trade barriers he said faced British business hoping to export to the US market \u2013 but declined to say what he could offer to Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d government in return. Johnson has repeatedly insisted NHS contracts will not be part of any future trade deal and put hospital funding at the heart of his bid for re-election. However, Labour has accused him of being willing to put it up for sale. What economic assessment has the government done of the impact of Boris Johnson\u2019s deal? Extraordinarily, it hasn\u2019t done any. Challenged by the Lib Dem Luciana Berger about why the government had failed to publish forecasts, the Brexit secretary, Steve Barclay, said: \u201cThere\u2019s no level of analysis that is probably going to change her vote and her mind. Indeed, as a former Treasury minister one of the things I\u2019m always aware of, is indeed it\u2019s difficult to model a deal that was only made on Thursday.\u201d He added that it would be difficult to model changes to policy by the new European commission, and to the global economic backdrop. The independent thinktank UK in a Changing Europe has published analysis comparing Johnson\u2019s agreement with Theresa May\u2019s deal, which came closer to achieving frictionless trade with the EU, in exchange for promising alignment with EU regulations in key areas. It found that Johnson\u2019s deal would be likely to reduce GDP per capita \u2013 a measure of living standards \u2013 by between 2.3% and 7% over the next decade, compared with remaining in the EU.

Consulting my map, I write the following numbers on something approximating a waxed luggage tag: \u201c22-37-71-34-33-32-31-30-08-01-33\u201d. I put the map away, slip the tag around my bike\u2019s handlebars and I\u2019m set for the morning. I\u2019ve never been to this part of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2019/apr/06/bradley-wiggins-tour-of-flanders-cycling-climbs-cafes-flemish-ardennes\" title=\"\">Flanders</a> before \u2013 it\u2019s the lesser-known French part, on the northernmost tip of the country, bordering Belgium \u2013 but I\u2019m now confident I can cycle today from my table in the riverside town of Saint-Venant, through Haverskerque, across the Nieppe forest, down into Merville and finally into the town of Estaires.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"240a9211430d302eeb342ccc18aaab57e2068081\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/240a9211430d302eeb342ccc18aaab57e2068081/0_0_1082_746/1000.jpg\" alt=\"flanders cycling map\" width=\"1000\" height=\"689\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Welcome to French Flanders\u2019 ingenious new cycle network. Launched earlier this year, the catchily titled R\u00e9seau Points-N\u0153uds V\u00e9lo (literally Network Node-Points Bike) comprises <a href=\"https://www.jadorelenord.fr/premierreseauvelo.html\" title=\"\">830km of minor roads and cycle paths</a> covering the Vall\u00e9e de la Lys, the Monts de Flandre hills and a small slice of southern Belgium. The clever bit is its hundreds of numbered signposts \u2013 or \u201cnode-points\u201d \u2013 each directing cyclists to the next numbered signpost. All riders need to do is pick up the map (\u20ac8), note down the node-point numbers on their chosen route and pedal away. The map also highlights restaurants, breweries, museums, attractions, campsites and eco-lodges, and shows the distances between the node-points, which makes tailoring your own Tour de Flandre extremely simple. And once you\u2019ve set off, there\u2019s no need to consult the map again, or worry about your phone dying.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d378edb81e66441f945f11a6b5a13bd3b3d7dde1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d378edb81e66441f945f11a6b5a13bd3b3d7dde1/0_397_4896_2938/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Node point north of Estaires\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Node point north of Estaires</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dixe Wills</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Less than three hours after setting off from London, I picked up my hire bike (<a href=\"http://eeuwenhout.info/\" title=\"\">eeuwenhout.info</a>) at Bailleul, one of the many small towns and villages within the network served by a railway station. On my three-day circular tour I would cover 180km, starting with a gentle climb into the low hills of the Monts de Flandre.</p> <p>It was lunchtime when I rolled into Terdeghem, a village of neat brick cottages and the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/category/Restaurant/HET-KERK-HOEK-479908782076521/\" title=\"\">Het Kerk </a><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/category/Restaurant/HET-KERK-HOEK-479908782076521/\" title=\"\">Hoek</a>, holder of the much-prized <em><a href=\"https://www.estaminets.fr/Pages/SiteMiseAJour.php\" title=\"\">Estaminets </a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.estaminets.fr/Pages/SiteMiseAJour.php\" title=\"\">flamands</a></em> marque, awarded to authentically Flemish restaurants and bars.

      "bodyText": "I\u2019m sitting down to a picnic breakfast at a sun-flecked table beside the River Lys in Flanders. Consulting my map, I write the following numbers on something approximating a waxed luggage tag: \u201c22-37-71-34-33-32-31-30-08-01-33\u201d. I put the map away, slip the tag around my bike\u2019s handlebars and I\u2019m set for the morning. I\u2019ve never been to this part of Flanders before \u2013 it\u2019s the lesser-known French part, on the northernmost tip of the country, bordering Belgium \u2013 but I\u2019m now confident I can cycle today from my table in the riverside town of Saint-Venant, through Haverskerque, across the Nieppe forest, down into Merville and finally into the town of Estaires. Welcome to French Flanders\u2019 ingenious new cycle network. Launched earlier this year, the catchily titled R\u00e9seau Points-N\u0153uds V\u00e9lo (literally Network Node-Points Bike) comprises 830km of minor roads and cycle paths covering the Vall\u00e9e de la Lys, the Monts de Flandre hills and a small slice of southern Belgium. The clever bit is its hundreds of numbered signposts \u2013 or \u201cnode-points\u201d \u2013 each directing cyclists to the next numbered signpost. All riders need to do is pick up the map (\u20ac8), note down the node-point numbers on their chosen route and pedal away. The map also highlights restaurants, breweries, museums, attractions, campsites and eco-lodges, and shows the distances between the node-points, which makes tailoring your own Tour de Flandre extremely simple. And once you\u2019ve set off, there\u2019s no need to consult the map again, or worry about your phone dying. Less than three hours after setting off from London, I picked up my hire bike (eeuwenhout.info) at Bailleul, one of the many small towns and villages within the network served by a railway station. On my three-day circular tour I would cover 180km, starting with a gentle climb into the low hills of the Monts de Flandre. It was lunchtime when I rolled into Terdeghem, a village of neat brick cottages and the Het Kerk Hoek, holder of the much-prized Estaminets flamands marque, awarded to authentically Flemish restaurants and bars. I think it\u2019s fairly safe to say that, like the rest of Flanders \u2013 which loves its beef, chicken, mussels and cheeses \u2013 it has yet to receive the memo about veganism. However, it\u2019s wonderful how far cow eyes and a sad inflection in the voice will get you. In no time, I was tucking into a beautiful platter of locally grown crudit\u00e9s, complete with little pots of dressings, sauces and a comp\u00f4te, along with a 3 Monts beer. \u201cBrewed just 3km from here,\u201d according to the barman. It was the first of many Flemish beers I sampled. At the Bellenaert eco-brewery in Outtersteene, where all the energy comes from renewables, I learned a little about the nuances of bitterness, density and colour. Flemish beers are usually fermented a second time in the bottle, which gives them a delicate crispness. I also discovered that the Flemish have a sceptical attitude to Mondays, and opening hours in general \u2013 my attempts to visit the museums dedicated to life on the French/Belgian border and bees were rebuffed by mus\u00e9e ferm\u00e9 signs. However, I had more luck when I breezed along the few kilometres (\u201c59-23-27-22-33\u201d) from Terdeghem to Cassel. Perched on the saddle between two hills, and sprinkled with gorgeous Flemish architecture, Cassel is said to be the inspiration for the nursery rhyme The Grand Old Duke of York, and was voted France\u2019s favourite village in a TV competition last year. On the beautiful old Grand\u2019Place I popped into the Mus\u00e9e de Flandre to unearth something of the region\u2019s history. It was rather bloody: the area was fought over by Burgundians, Dutch, Spanish, French and Germans (though not all at once). However, its people did inspire Pieter Bruegel the Elder, so there\u2019s that. I was just about to leave when I heard Harpo\u2019s 1975 smash, Movie Star, being played outside by a marching band, striding over the cobbles. And then came another. And another. I had stumbled upon a competition \u2013 six brass bands from local villages taking turns to roam around Cassel\u2019s Grand\u2019Place blasting out three-minute renditions of popular classics, from Abba and Aha to the White Stripes and, well, AC/DC.

And they\u2019re not actually on the phone, because they don\u2019t know how to use it. It\u2019s an old-fashioned rotary telephone, finger-in-the-dial variety.

It\u2019s a kind of social experiment, about different generations, lost skills, changing technology \u2013 what Loxford media studies teacher Mr Rushworth calls \u201cconvergence\u201d. OK, and it\u2019s also about having a laugh; and getting my generation\u2019s own back for those times we\u2019ve had to go crawling to a teenager for technical assistance, such as asking how to make the video on WhatsApp work.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Kids can\u2019t read maps.

They may actually talk, verbally, via WhatsApp and FaceTime, to their closest friends and parents. Rhianna FaceTimes family in Bangladesh.</p> <p>They recognise the old phone from movies (and from watching The Sweeney in media studies \u2013 I want to go to Mr Rushworth\u2019s media studies classes). Do you have to call the operator first, wonders Jannugan? Is the operator even still there?</p> <p>Oh, it\u2019s going to be hard to find out because we have a technical problem: Loxford is so modern there isn\u2019t a single old-fashioned BT phone socket in the building. We can\u2019t actually plug this phone in to surprise the operator with their first call in 20 years.</p> <p>We\u2019ll just have to simulate. So what\u2019s the operator\u2019s number? Hey, you know what, you don\u2019t have to call the operator, you can just call your parents. So what\u2019s that number? \u201cYou have to actually dial the number instead of going to contacts,\u201d suggests Aissato.</p> <p>But obviously they don\u2019t know their numbers, although Jannugan knows his mother\u2019s ends in 202. Hang on, he does know his landline number, amazingly, for emergencies, and there\u2019s always someone home. So let\u2019s dial it.</p> <p>This is when the fun begins. Someone knows you have to turn the dial, but how far? They put their fingers in, then dial a teeny bit, then dial back, is that it? It\u2019s hopeless, none of them dials right round to the stopper, then releases before moving on to the next number. And they haven\u2019t taken the handset off the cradle, so they wouldn\u2019t be getting through anyway. Sad, worried parents, not to mention the lonely operator, would remain unrung.</p> <p>I\u2019m afraid, <a href=\"http://www.almonbrownstrowger.com/\" title=\"\">Almon Brown Strowger</a>, that your design is an unintuitive disaster. And the kids are not impressed. How long, just to dial the number? And if it\u2019s busy, you have to go through the whole process again? On the plus side, you don\u2019t have to worry about running out of charge. <br><strong>Enjoyment: 3/10</strong><strong> Achievement: 4/10</strong></p> <h2>2 Get up\u2026 using a wind-up alarm clock</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"27bc4dc6c5f304072e33b1a12e812d448ab13a38\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/27bc4dc6c5f304072e33b1a12e812d448ab13a38/0_1012_4218_3444/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aissato tries to set an old-fashioned alarm clock\" width=\"1000\" height=\"817\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aissato wonders what makes an old-fashioned alarm clock tick.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Spring/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Traditionally this is not an easy task for a teenager.

Yes, it is: a Nintendo Game Boy handheld console, circa 1990. But how does a 15-year-old schoolgirl in east London in 2019 know that? From <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/stranger-things\" title=\"\">Stranger Things</a>, she says. Really? I thought the Netflix sci-fi horror was set in the 80s, pre-Game Boy?

It <em>is</em> one of those spinny things, also known as a record player. No, they\u2019re not CDs Tanu, they\u2019re records, seven-inch singles, some fairly desperate ones from my local charity shop (I wasn\u2019t going to risk anyone\u2019s precious vinyl on this lot). Iqra, Najaat and Tanu listen to music on apps and YouTube, via their phones, obviously. Pay for it? Eh? Why would anyone do that? The girls like masked UK rapper <a href=\"https://www.mhuncho.co.uk/\" title=\"\">M Huncho</a>; Tanu\u2019s more of a rock and pop man. Well, I have here <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrpsi0Gt_dY\" title=\"\">Topanga by David Soul</a>. Yeah, pretty much the M Huncho of his day.</p> <p>They manage to put the disc on the turntable, Tanu moves the arm across, and puts it down on the rotating record \u2013 gently, Tanu! We have music, of sorts, even if it\u2019s halfway through the song.</p> <p>\u201cIt sounds scary, like a horror movie,\u201d Iqra says. She\u2019s not wrong, but that\u2019s because it\u2019s on 33rpm. We talk about what changing the speed does, and needles, and how many songs you might find on a record like this \u2013 only one on each side! Then I ask them to start from the beginning of the record.</p> <p>This proves tricky. Tanu picks up the arm and puts it down in the middle of the song again. \u201cCan you rewind it?\u201d Najaat asks. Good question: no.</p> <p>We watch and listen for a while, the needle riding the groove, David Soul\u2019s spooky howling (it really is a terrible record at any speed) echoing across the classroom. Eventually, Iqra realises that the needle is moving, slowly, towards the centre of the record. So where\u2019s the beginning? The edge! She picks it up, and puts the needle down on the edge, the beginning. Yay!</p> <p>They don\u2019t have much good to say about the turntable \u2013 too complicated, easily broken, bad sound quality.</p> <p>But then they seem to remember that record players aren\u2019t just about lounging about listening to rubbish songs, they belong in other places. Suddenly Iqra and Najaat are pretending to be DJs \u2013 the club sort, sorry @gregjames \u2013 spinning and scratching (has David Soul ever been scratched before?).

I couldn\u2019t find an actual Walkman, but this Sony cassette player is as near as dammit.

Now find the school. After flicking through, marvelling at how long it must have taken to make, they find the index, and Loxford Lane, IG1. Good start. The index directs them to \u201c5G, 71\u201d. So they turn to page 5, where there seems to be a column called G, and here\u2019s a boating lake, which must be the boating lake up the road, yay! Except the boating lake on the map is in Regent\u2019s Park. A fail, then. Back to the index: 71 is the page, 5 and G the column and row, Ilford, this looks promising, where\u2019s the school then? What do you think \u201csch\u201d might stand for? I\u2019m sure they would have found it, eventually, but we\u2019d have been there all day.</p> <p>We have been granted special permission to leave the premises \u2013 no, not to get takeaway, Iqra \u2013 but to buy stamps. And I\u2019ve heard they can be bought on Gordon Road near the junction with Henley Road. It doesn\u2019t go brilliantly. Where are we now? \u201cIt\u2019s just an alleyway,\u201d Iqra says. Well this looks like a road? After looking at the map, she says, \u201cIt\u2019s just called \u2018Road\u2019.\u201d That\u2019s because the first part of the name is up the other end: Gordon Road! We pass Staines Road, Eton Road, Mortlake Road, and find it, the post office. Not because they have map-read their way here, but because they knew where we were going.</p> <p>Still, they successfully purchase stamps for the first time, which involves interaction with another human being.</p> <p>Now to post them: where\u2019s the post box? Just there, Iqra says. No, that one\u2019s broken, there\u2019s a better one on Woodlands Road. Najaat looks at her phone, she\u2019s only got 10%. Oi, put it away. \u201cOh yeah, we\u2019re in the 80s,\u201d she remembers. Back on page 71, Najaat finds Woodlands Road and we set off, she and Iqra recommending M Huncho tracks to me as we walk. In the right direction, as it happens, and this time I think they are actually using the A-Z. There may even be a happy ending to this story: some time in the next couple of days, on to the doormats of three surprised sets of parents in east London, three letters may drop.

And they\u2019re not actually on the phone, because they don\u2019t know how to use it. It\u2019s an old-fashioned rotary telephone, finger-in-the-dial variety. They\u2019re tapping it, prodding at the holes. Hahahaha \u2013 they haven\u2019t got a clue. Loxford is an academy in Ilford, east London. I\u2019ve come here with a suitcase stuffed full of the past, tech from my own childhood, mostly borrowed from nostalgic hoarder colleagues. Everything in the case is obsolete: it\u2019s all been shrunk to fit into the smartphones today\u2019s 15-year-olds almost all have. It\u2019s a kind of social experiment, about different generations, lost skills, changing technology \u2013 what Loxford media studies teacher Mr Rushworth calls \u201cconvergence\u201d. OK, and it\u2019s also about having a laugh; and getting my generation\u2019s own back for those times we\u2019ve had to go crawling to a teenager for technical assistance, such as asking how to make the video on WhatsApp work. My first team of year 10 time travellers is Jannugan Sasiharan (plays games on his phone; watches YouTubers \u2013 he\u2019d rather not say which ones); Aissato Jalo (likes reading; family from Guinea-Bissau; speaks with an American accent, because she learned English by watching US TV shows such as Friends); and Rhianna Choudhury (prefect, head of year, probably should be running the country #VoteRhianna). 1 Phone home\u2026 with a rotary dial telephone Aissato, Rhianna and Jannugan communicate with their friends on Snapchat and iMessage. They may actually talk, verbally, via WhatsApp and FaceTime, to their closest friends and parents. Rhianna FaceTimes family in Bangladesh. They recognise the old phone from movies (and from watching The Sweeney in media studies \u2013 I want to go to Mr Rushworth\u2019s media studies classes). Do you have to call the operator first, wonders Jannugan? Is the operator even still there? Oh, it\u2019s going to be hard to find out because we have a technical problem: Loxford is so modern there isn\u2019t a single old-fashioned BT phone socket in the building. We can\u2019t actually plug this phone in to surprise the operator with their first call in 20 years. We\u2019ll just have to simulate. So what\u2019s the operator\u2019s number? Hey, you know what, you don\u2019t have to call the operator, you can just call your parents. So what\u2019s that number? \u201cYou have to actually dial the number instead of going to contacts,\u201d suggests Aissato. But obviously they don\u2019t know their numbers, although Jannugan knows his mother\u2019s ends in 202. Hang on, he does know his landline number, amazingly, for emergencies, and there\u2019s always someone home. So let\u2019s dial it. This is when the fun begins. Someone knows you have to turn the dial, but how far? They put their fingers in, then dial a teeny bit, then dial back, is that it? It\u2019s hopeless, none of them dials right round to the stopper, then releases before moving on to the next number. And they haven\u2019t taken the handset off the cradle, so they wouldn\u2019t be getting through anyway. Sad, worried parents, not to mention the lonely operator, would remain unrung. I\u2019m afraid, Almon Brown Strowger, that your design is an unintuitive disaster. And the kids are not impressed. How long, just to dial the number? And if it\u2019s busy, you have to go through the whole process again? On the plus side, you don\u2019t have to worry about running out of charge. Enjoyment: 3/10 Achievement: 4/10 2 Get up\u2026 using a wind-up alarm clock Traditionally this is not an easy task for a teenager. Jannugan\u2019s grandmother used to have one like this, he says, correctly identifying my next item, an alarm clock with bells on the top and a little hammer that jiggles between them. \u201cIt\u2019s not working,\u201d he says. \u201cI think it needs batteries\u2026 or do you wind it up?\u201d Good work: soon there\u2019s a reassuring ticking from the clock. They pass it round, winding (the alarm needs winding separately), twiddling, and eventually figure out that the third hand, the red one, must set the alarm. They don\u2019t find the little catch to release the hammer, that\u2019s just too stone age, but once I\u2019ve helped with that, they get it going: ding-a-ding-a-ding-ding\u2026 Jesus, remember? Like the hammer and the bells are inside your head. \u201cMy phone\u2019s much easier to use,\u201d Rhianna says. \u201cBut this wakes you up more, it\u2019s really loud,\u201d Jannugan says, possibly even a little impressed. Enjoyment: 5/10 Achievement: 7/10 3 Tune in\u2026 to the wireless So now we\u2019re wide awake, let\u2019s turn the radio on. \u201cThat\u2019s a radio?\u201d Aissato says, about the little Sony model I\u2019ve brought along. They all say they don\u2019t really listen to the radio, sorry @gregjames. Rhianna\u2019s father sometimes has it on in the car, to know what\u2019s going on. They do figure out how to pull the aerial up. \u201cAntenna,\u201d Jannugan says. To catch the signal or something, Rhianna says. From radio towers, Aissato says. Hey, between them they\u2019re practically Marconi. But then there\u2019s a lot of twiddling and switching, crackle and hiss, some discussion about the meaning of FM/AM/LW/SW. (Frequency modulation and amplitude modulation; I\u2019d forgotten that.) Jannugan wonders if the towers still transmit, for radios like this. Yes! They still print newspapers, too, by the way. Eventually, they stumble across Radio 5 Live, where the talk is about cricket. And then the knob for tuning falls off. Enjoyment: 6/10 Achievement: 6/10 4 Look it up\u2026 in an encyclopedia I set them a task \u2013 who won the Cricket World Cup? Easy, they say, England! No, in 1983. Ah. Ordinarily they would ask Google (they talk about Google, rather than anywhere Google might take them to). It would take two seconds. But there\u2019s no Google here; they\u2019re the search engines \u2013 go search. \u201cMaybe this has it,\u201d Aissato says, picking up a 1991 Pears\u2019 Cyclopaedia. \u201cI\u2019ve heard of an encyclopedia, but not a cyclopaedia,\u201d she says. Hmm, me, too, if I\u2019m honest. Here\u2019s a fun fact about Pears: they are the same people who make the soap, and the final edition, the 126th, was published in 2017. They\u2019ve never seen an encyclopedia, but they get the hang of it, which is good news: books still work. They discover a contents page. Would it be in Events? Probably Sport. From there, it\u2019s a stroll: they figure out that it\u2019s arranged alphabetically, and have an answer in about three minutes. India won the World Cup in 1983. Enjoyment: 5/10 Achievement: 8/10 5 Play time \u2026 with an old-school Nintendo Game Boy \u201cGame Boy!\u201d Rhianna says, excitedly, pointing at one of the objects on the table. Yes, it is: a Nintendo Game Boy handheld console, circa 1990. But how does a 15-year-old schoolgirl in east London in 2019 know that? From Stranger Things, she says. Really? I thought the Netflix sci-fi horror was set in the 80s, pre-Game Boy? Maybe also from The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, she says. Turns out they\u2019ve also played with Game Boy emulators on their phones, but never a real one, so this is exciting. \u201cIt\u2019s original, pristine,\u201d Jannugan says. He\u2019s not getting anywhere near it, though, because Rhianna has kidnapped the Game Boy. There are no problems operating it, Super Mario is loaded up and she\u2019s away: \u201cDo I have to grab the mushroom\u2026 oh I missed it \u2013 it gets you another life.\u201d \u201cAlso a good source of vitamin D,\u201d Mr Rushworth says, injecting some nutritional education into proceedings. Rhianna\u2019s current favourite mobile game is a cooking simulation one called Cooking Fever. She likes Subway Surfers, too, as do Aissato and Jannugan. But there\u2019s a desirable authenticity about the old tech. \u201cI knew I\u2019d be obsessed with Game Boy,\u201d Rhianna says. \u201cIf my parents got me one they\u2019d never see me, it\u2019s so addictive. I want one.\u201d It\u2019s the only winner so far. \u201cSometimes the original is better,\u201d Rhianna admits, before loading Tetris without any problems (maybe ease of use is directly proportional to desirability). But it\u2019s clearly the exception to the rule. \u201cEverything here has been replaced by a smartphone,\u201d Aissato observes, of all my gear. \u201cIt\u2019s quicker, more efficient, you can do all of these things on your phone,\u201d Rhianna says. \u201cIf I was to lose [my phone] I\u2019d be, like, so confused.\u201d Enjoyment: 10/10 Achievement: 10/10 Jannugan, Aissato and Rhianna have to go to an awards assembly now. I imagine they\u2019ll be collecting loads. Time for fresh legs. Six of them, with three fresh minds, belonging to Iqra Kadri (cheeky; says she should have worn mascara for the pictures), Najaat Shahbal (shier; likes science and maths), Tanu Pathak (laid-back; cool), and five new tasks. 6 Spin class\u2026 with a turntable \u201cIt looks like one of those spinny things,\u201d Iqra says. It is one of those spinny things, also known as a record player. No, they\u2019re not CDs Tanu, they\u2019re records, seven-inch singles, some fairly desperate ones from my local charity shop (I wasn\u2019t going to risk anyone\u2019s precious vinyl on this lot). Iqra, Najaat and Tanu listen to music on apps and YouTube, via their phones, obviously. Pay for it? Eh? Why would anyone do that? The girls like masked UK rapper M Huncho; Tanu\u2019s more of a rock and pop man. Well, I have here Topanga by David Soul. Yeah, pretty much the M Huncho of his day. They manage to put the disc on the turntable, Tanu moves the arm across, and puts it down on the rotating record \u2013 gently, Tanu! We have music, of sorts, even if it\u2019s halfway through the song. \u201cIt sounds scary, like a horror movie,\u201d Iqra says. She\u2019s not wrong, but that\u2019s because it\u2019s on 33rpm. We talk about what changing the speed does, and needles, and how many songs you might find on a record like this \u2013 only one on each side! Then I ask them to start from the beginning of the record. This proves tricky. Tanu picks up the arm and puts it down in the middle of the song again. \u201cCan you rewind it?\u201d Najaat asks. Good question: no. We watch and listen for a while, the needle riding the groove, David Soul\u2019s spooky howling (it really is a terrible record at any speed) echoing across the classroom. Eventually, Iqra realises that the needle is moving, slowly, towards the centre of the record. So where\u2019s the beginning? The edge! She picks it up, and puts the needle down on the edge, the beginning. Yay! They don\u2019t have much good to say about the turntable \u2013 too complicated, easily broken, bad sound quality. But then they seem to remember that record players aren\u2019t just about lounging about listening to rubbish songs, they belong in other places. Suddenly Iqra and Najaat are pretending to be DJs \u2013 the club sort, sorry @gregjames \u2013 spinning and scratching (has David Soul ever been scratched before?). The spinny thing reclaims its credibility. Enjoyment: 7/10 Achievement: 6/10 7 Play it again\u2026 with a Sony Walkman Mistake number one: the teenagers fail to take the tape out of its case before trying to get it in the player. I couldn\u2019t find an actual Walkman, but this Sony cassette player is as near as dammit. They find and open the door, eventually get the tape the right way round; this one does have rewind, which I nudge them in the direction of, then play. There\u2019s a really positive reaction in the room. Not from Iqra, Najaat or Tanu, sadly, but from Mr Rushworth. Turns out 7800\u00b0 Fahrenheit by Bon Jovi is one of Mr Rushworth\u2019s all-time favourite records. He used to listen to it on the way to training\u2026 yeah, all right, this isn\u2019t about you, sir. For the kids it\u2019s the usual issues: too complicated, too big, too rubbish; why would you pay for it? I show them how to wind a tape back in, using a pencil, not that they\u2019ll ever need to do that. Enjoyment: 5/10 (Mr Rushworth: 10/10) Achievement: 4/10 8 Snap it\u2026 on a 35mm camera \u201cWhere\u2019s the screen? Normally there\u2019s a screen,\u201d Iqra says, looking at the back of the camera. \u201cOh, you peek through that, innit,\u201d Tanu says, looking through the viewfinder, then pushing the button. All correct, but there\u2019s no film. They open the door, but loading a film proves too hard. Sophia, the Guardian\u2019s photographer, shows us how to pull out the film this much, push the roll in, then shut the door. We hear the whirr as it winds itself on. I remember pretending my camera was an electric razor during that bit \u2013 actually, probably during the rewind when the whirr was longer. Oh it was a laugh, back in the day. Iqra, Najaat and Tanu are soon snapping away: each other, selfies, zooming in and out, photographing the actual photographer. Normally they take photos on their phones \u2013 family, friends \u2013 then share them. The idea of waiting to get your photos developed is quite alien to them. \u201cDid you have to pay for it?\u201d Najaat asks. \u201cAnd you can\u2019t check it? Imagine if you print it out and it\u2019s ugly.\u201d Enjoyment: 7/10 Achievement: 7/10 9 Write home\u2026 using pen and paper Here\u2019s some paper, Basildon Bond, blue, found at the bottom of a drawer. Now write a letter! \u201cFoundation pens,\u201d Najaat says. Near enough. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Iqra says. That\u2019s because it needs this: ink (also blue, I seem to remember that it was easier to get out of clothes than black). \u201cDidn\u2019t they dip in feathers,\u201d Tanu says. Don\u2019t be cheeky, how old do you think I am? They start by just dipping their pens into the ink pot, and that seems to work OK. They\u2019re not cartridge pens, but rather the ones with the little rubber reservoir you squeeze to suck up the ink. It soon gets very inky. That\u2019s why they\u2019re called fountain pens not foundation pens, Najaat. Snapchat\u2019s much less messy. We stick to dipping. Dear Mother, begins Iqra. Is that what she calls her? \u201cNo, I just wrote it. I call her Mummy.\u201d Nice neat writing, though; less so, Tanu. And so, for the first time ever, they write letters home, about what a brilliant morning they\u2019re having at school (I imagine). Actually, they write half-letters, because we\u2019re running out of time and we need to send them. I have envelopes, to be addressed, which Iqra does quite eccentrically: parents\u2019 names top left, then address top right, postcode first, then Ilford, then street. Will it ever get there? They\u2019ll have to post them first\u2026 Enjoyment: 3/10 Achievement: 5/10 10 Find it\u2026 on the map! Kids these days, they can\u2019t read maps. The minute they run out of power, or data and can\u2019t get to Google Maps or Waze, they are hopelessly lost. \u201cIt\u2019s a book,\u201d Tanu says. \u201cA guide, a map of the whole of London, basically.\u201d Yes and it\u2019s called the A-Z. Now find the school. After flicking through, marvelling at how long it must have taken to make, they find the index, and Loxford Lane, IG1. Good start. The index directs them to \u201c5G, 71\u201d. So they turn to page 5, where there seems to be a column called G, and here\u2019s a boating lake, which must be the boating lake up the road, yay! Except the boating lake on the map is in Regent\u2019s Park. A fail, then. Back to the index: 71 is the page, 5 and G the column and row, Ilford, this looks promising, where\u2019s the school then? What do you think \u201csch\u201d might stand for? I\u2019m sure they would have found it, eventually, but we\u2019d have been there all day. We have been granted special permission to leave the premises \u2013 no, not to get takeaway, Iqra \u2013 but to buy stamps. And I\u2019ve heard they can be bought on Gordon Road near the junction with Henley Road. It doesn\u2019t go brilliantly. Where are we now? \u201cIt\u2019s just an alleyway,\u201d Iqra says. Well this looks like a road? After looking at the map, she says, \u201cIt\u2019s just called \u2018Road\u2019.\u201d That\u2019s because the first part of the name is up the other end: Gordon Road! We pass Staines Road, Eton Road, Mortlake Road, and find it, the post office. Not because they have map-read their way here, but because they knew where we were going. Still, they successfully purchase stamps for the first time, which involves interaction with another human being. Now to post them: where\u2019s the post box? Just there, Iqra says. No, that one\u2019s broken, there\u2019s a better one on Woodlands Road. Najaat looks at her phone, she\u2019s only got 10%. Oi, put it away. \u201cOh yeah, we\u2019re in the 80s,\u201d she remembers. Back on page 71, Najaat finds Woodlands Road and we set off, she and Iqra recommending M Huncho tracks to me as we walk. In the right direction, as it happens, and this time I think they are actually using the A-Z. There may even be a happy ending to this story: some time in the next couple of days, on to the doormats of three surprised sets of parents in east London, three letters may drop. Half-finished, messy, splodgy\u2026 but actual hand-written letters home. Just like in the olden days.

      "body": "<p>On its polished surface, Donizetti\u2019s <strong><a href=\"https://www.roh.org.uk/tickets-and-events/don-pasquale-by-damiano-michieletto-details\" title=\"\">Don Pasquale</a></strong> (1843) is a criss-cross of stock comic characters: rich, ageing bachelor-lech; poor, feckless nephew; glamorous minx of a widow; scheming doctor. With its lampooning and cruelty, it isn\u2019t easy to love. How can we laugh when a young woman slaps an old man, a gesture so shocking the music stops, bright harmony and bustling orchestration shriven into abrupt retreat. Discomfort is part of the work\u2019s gleaming weaponry. The Royal Opera\u2019s new production, directed by Damiano Michieletto, conducted by Evelino Pid\u00f2 and starring one of opera\u2019s all-time greats, the Welsh bass-baritone <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/live/2018/jul/05/bryn-terfel-webchat-singer-falstaff-verdi-royal-opera\" title=\"\">Bryn Terfel</a>, recognised these tensions, at times nastily, at others disarmingly. I warmed to this piece, after long avoidance, for the first time.</p> <p>Michieletto and his designer Paolo Fantin have borrowed from the language of cinema, the go-to source for so many updated opera productions: two this week alone featuring director\u2019s chair, film studio paraphernalia and wheel-on classic cars (see also <em>Rigoletto</em> below). The pinging and dinging of smartphones \u2013 even the doddery Don can read an SMS \u2013 are absorbed into the aural and visual narrative. Fantin\u2019s skilful set, with neon-outline roof and some clever business with doors, conjures a vulgar world of greed and bad taste, in which Norina \u2013 here a makeup artist to the celebs \u2013 revels. Soon, in her mock marriage to Pasquale, she\u2019s the one in glitter and furs, steamrolling her \u201chusband\u201d, and his house, into a wholesale makeover.</p> <p>The quartet of singers, not always secure vocally but collegiate as a team, had to work hard in an open set that offered little acoustic support. They interacted deftly around Terfel\u2019s towering, minutely detailed Pasquale, his role debut. As he moves into a new phase of repertoire, his voice remains russety and focused, even when he\u2019s required to manipulate a hand-held puppet and sing a breakneck patter song. His crumpled realisation that he has been duped, that the game of love is over, was lacerating in its pathos.</p> <p>Markus Werba\u2019s leather-jacketed Doctor Malatesta, robust and sly, and Olga Peretyatko in her Royal Opera debut as the gorgeous vixen Norina, appeared to have their own magnetic relationship. What were they up to? She\u2019s supposed to be in love with earnest Ernesto (Ioan Hotea). It all enriched the generic, sour #MeToo odour. The production, first seen in Paris earlier this year, is uneven. Yet the music wins out, vibrantly and effervescently. Pid\u00f2, a bel canto authority, conducted with crispness and finesse. Donizetti gives little to the chorus (well sung here) but demands much of the orchestra, with lavishly accompanied recitatives and many conspicuous solos. Throughout, the ROH players more than delivered.</p> <p>If Michieletto and co added a few extra strands to <em>Don Pasquale</em>, Glyndebourne tour\u2019s new staging of Verdi\u2019s <strong><a href=\"https://www.glyndebourne.com/events/rigoletto/\" title=\"\">Rigoletto</a></strong> constructed an entirely different carapace. The tragedy of the hated jester and his beloved daughter, based on Victor Hugo\u2019s <em>Le roi s\u2019amus</em><em>e</em>, is one of opera\u2019s simpler plots. Christiane Lutz, making her directorial debut in a work that is also a first for Glyndebourne, introduces so many complications that it becomes almost unrecognisable: we\u2019re in 1920s Hollywood, complete with Rigoletto-as-Chaplin, two doppelg\u00e4ngers whose identities are never entirely clear, and a dumbshow enactment suggesting suicide, baby snatching and incest.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0ab2347823cf4afbf16f0a288522beba7fe68a69\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0ab2347823cf4afbf16f0a288522beba7fe68a69/0_0_3892_2552/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Matteo Lippi (Duke of Mantua) and Vuvu Mpofu (Gilda) in Glyndebourne\u2019s first ever Rigoletto.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"656\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Matteo Lippi (Duke of Mantua) and Vuvu Mpofu (Gilda) in Glyndebourne\u2019s first ever Rigoletto.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Luckily, under the baton of Thomas Blunt, there was sterling quality in the orchestra, chorus and cast, with the baritone Nikoloz Lagvilava magnificent and burly in the title role. Matteo Lippi\u2019s Duke was well judged: loud, brash, showing off those top notes as if they were rippling muscles. Gilda, tenderly sung and acted by Vuvu Mpofu, is often compared to an angel. Accordingly, she wears large white wings (sometimes). Christian Tabakoff\u2019s sets, with lighting by Benedikt Zehm and projections by Anton Trauner, looked attractive, though Rigoletto\u2019s house, where he keeps his daughter under lock and key, had more the feel of an open prison. Good ideas were weighed down by literalness. If all can be streamlined by the time it reaches the main festival, it may work. Catch it on tour, with Donizetti\u2019s softer comedy, <em><a href=\"https://www.glyndebourne.com/events/lelisir-damore/\" title=\"\">L\u2019elisir d\u2019amore</a></em>, and Handel\u2019s dazzling <em><a href=\"https://www.glyndebourne.com/events/rinaldo-tour-2019/\" title=\"\">Rinaldo</a></em>, until December.</p> <p>In a UK premiere at the Linbury theatre, two outstanding performances, by the soprano <a href=\"https://juliabullock.com/\" title=\"\">Julia Bullock</a> and pianist <a href=\"https://www.cedrictiberghien.com/\" title=\"\">C\u00e9dric Tiberghien</a>, gave unity to a fractured evening. <strong><a href=\"https://www.roh.org.uk/tickets-and-events/zauberland-by-katie-mitchell-details\" title=\"\">Zauberland</a></strong>, directed by Katie Mitchell, attempts to forge Robert Schumann\u2019s 1844 song cycle <em>Dichterliebe</em> (poems by Heinrich Heine) to new songs by the composer Bernard Foccroulle with texts by Martin Crimp. The starting point is Schumann\u2019s excision, from his original manuscript, of four songs, leaving the 16 we know. This is described in the programme as an \u201cunsolved mystery\u201d though it might well be termed \u201cartist\u2019s prerogative\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0281c80e57facb1a45db9027e9f59c89cf31ea83\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0281c80e57facb1a45db9027e9f59c89cf31ea83/0_0_3800_2500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Zauberland at the Linbury theatre.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"658\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Zauberland at the Linbury theatre.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patrick Berger</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Whichever, the Foccroulle-Crimp songs, engaging in themselves \u2013 delicate, imagery-rich and often sensuously melismatic \u2013 threw no light on the Schumann. A promising storyline involving a young pregnant woman, forced to leave Syria and travel to Germany, is suggested chiefly by atmosphere. Because of poor sightlines in the Linbury I missed most of the action, but Mitchell\u2019s preference for symbolic, patterned repetition meant gaps could be filled by guesswork. Listening to Bullock and Tiberghien, attendant and redundant mysteries aside, made absorbing sense.</p> <p><em>Star ratings (out of five)<br>Don Pasquale </em>\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605<em><br>Rigoletto </em>\u2605\u2605\u2605<em><br>Zauberland </em>\u2605\u2605\u2605</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.roh.org.uk/tickets-and-events/don-pasquale-by-damiano-michieletto-details\">Don Pasquale</a> is at the Royal Opera House, London, until 2 November</p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.glyndebourne.com/events/rigoletto/\">Rigoletto</a> is at Glyndebourne, East Sussex, until 2 November, then tours to Canterbury, Milton Keynes, Liverpool, Woking and Norwich until 7 December<br></p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "On its polished surface, Donizetti\u2019s Don Pasquale (1843) is a criss-cross of stock comic characters: rich, ageing bachelor-lech; poor, feckless nephew; glamorous minx of a widow; scheming doctor. With its lampooning and cruelty, it isn\u2019t easy to love. How can we laugh when a young woman slaps an old man, a gesture so shocking the music stops, bright harmony and bustling orchestration shriven into abrupt retreat. Discomfort is part of the work\u2019s gleaming weaponry. The Royal Opera\u2019s new production, directed by Damiano Michieletto, conducted by Evelino Pid\u00f2 and starring one of opera\u2019s all-time greats, the Welsh bass-baritone Bryn Terfel, recognised these tensions, at times nastily, at others disarmingly. I warmed to this piece, after long avoidance, for the first time. Michieletto and his designer Paolo Fantin have borrowed from the language of cinema, the go-to source for so many updated opera productions: two this week alone featuring director\u2019s chair, film studio paraphernalia and wheel-on classic cars (see also Rigoletto below). The pinging and dinging of smartphones \u2013 even the doddery Don can read an SMS \u2013 are absorbed into the aural and visual narrative. Fantin\u2019s skilful set, with neon-outline roof and some clever business with doors, conjures a vulgar world of greed and bad taste, in which Norina \u2013 here a makeup artist to the celebs \u2013 revels. Soon, in her mock marriage to Pasquale, she\u2019s the one in glitter and furs, steamrolling her \u201chusband\u201d, and his house, into a wholesale makeover. The quartet of singers, not always secure vocally but collegiate as a team, had to work hard in an open set that offered little acoustic support. They interacted deftly around Terfel\u2019s towering, minutely detailed Pasquale, his role debut. As he moves into a new phase of repertoire, his voice remains russety and focused, even when he\u2019s required to manipulate a hand-held puppet and sing a breakneck patter song. His crumpled realisation that he has been duped, that the game of love is over, was lacerating in its pathos. Markus Werba\u2019s leather-jacketed Doctor Malatesta, robust and sly, and Olga Peretyatko in her Royal Opera debut as the gorgeous vixen Norina, appeared to have their own magnetic relationship. What were they up to? She\u2019s supposed to be in love with earnest Ernesto (Ioan Hotea). It all enriched the generic, sour #MeToo odour. The production, first seen in Paris earlier this year, is uneven. Yet the music wins out, vibrantly and effervescently. Pid\u00f2, a bel canto authority, conducted with crispness and finesse. Donizetti gives little to the chorus (well sung here) but demands much of the orchestra, with lavishly accompanied recitatives and many conspicuous solos. Throughout, the ROH players more than delivered. If Michieletto and co added a few extra strands to Don Pasquale, Glyndebourne tour\u2019s new staging of Verdi\u2019s Rigoletto constructed an entirely different carapace. The tragedy of the hated jester and his beloved daughter, based on Victor Hugo\u2019s Le roi s\u2019amuse, is one of opera\u2019s simpler plots. Christiane Lutz, making her directorial debut in a work that is also a first for Glyndebourne, introduces so many complications that it becomes almost unrecognisable: we\u2019re in 1920s Hollywood, complete with Rigoletto-as-Chaplin, two doppelg\u00e4ngers whose identities are never entirely clear, and a dumbshow enactment suggesting suicide, baby snatching and incest. Luckily, under the baton of Thomas Blunt, there was sterling quality in the orchestra, chorus and cast, with the baritone Nikoloz Lagvilava magnificent and burly in the title role. Matteo Lippi\u2019s Duke was well judged: loud, brash, showing off those top notes as if they were rippling muscles. Gilda, tenderly sung and acted by Vuvu Mpofu, is often compared to an angel. Accordingly, she wears large white wings (sometimes). Christian Tabakoff\u2019s sets, with lighting by Benedikt Zehm and projections by Anton Trauner, looked attractive, though Rigoletto\u2019s house, where he keeps his daughter under lock and key, had more the feel of an open prison. Good ideas were weighed down by literalness. If all can be streamlined by the time it reaches the main festival, it may work. Catch it on tour, with Donizetti\u2019s softer comedy, L\u2019elisir d\u2019amore, and Handel\u2019s dazzling Rinaldo, until December. In a UK premiere at the Linbury theatre, two outstanding performances, by the soprano Julia Bullock and pianist C\u00e9dric Tiberghien, gave unity to a fractured evening. Zauberland, directed by Katie Mitchell, attempts to forge Robert Schumann\u2019s 1844 song cycle Dichterliebe (poems by Heinrich Heine) to new songs by the composer Bernard Foccroulle with texts by Martin Crimp. The starting point is Schumann\u2019s excision, from his original manuscript, of four songs, leaving the 16 we know. This is described in the programme as an \u201cunsolved mystery\u201d though it might well be termed \u201cartist\u2019s prerogative\u201d. Whichever, the Foccroulle-Crimp songs, engaging in themselves \u2013 delicate, imagery-rich and often sensuously melismatic \u2013 threw no light on the Schumann. A promising storyline involving a young pregnant woman, forced to leave Syria and travel to Germany, is suggested chiefly by atmosphere. Because of poor sightlines in the Linbury I missed most of the action, but Mitchell\u2019s preference for symbolic, patterned repetition meant gaps could be filled by guesswork. Listening to Bullock and Tiberghien, attendant and redundant mysteries aside, made absorbing sense. Star ratings (out of five) Don Pasquale \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Rigoletto \u2605\u2605\u2605 Zauberland \u2605\u2605\u2605 Don Pasquale is at the Royal Opera House, London, until 2 November Rigoletto is at Glyndebourne, East Sussex, until 2 November, then tours to Canterbury, Milton Keynes, Liverpool, Woking and Norwich until 7 December",

Going into Sunday\u2019s third game of the series at Sydney\u2019s Qudos Bank Arena, the Diamonds and Silver Ferns are locked at 1-1 after two matches in New Zealand.</p> <p>Diamonds\u2019 coach Lisa Alexander said Australia wouldn\u2019t bring in a replacement for Hadley as they had picked 13 rather than the normal 12 in the squad, which included an extra midcourter.<br></p> <p>\u201cWe really feel for Paige, especially given she would have been playing in front of her home crowd tomorrow,\u201d Alexander said on Saturday. \u201cTo be losing her from the team for the remaining two matches of the series isn\u2019t ideal but we\u2019re confident we have the depth within our group to get the job done.\u201d</p> <p>A win on Sunday would go a long way toward securing Australia a ninth Constellation Cup series in 10 years, with the final match to be played in Perth on October 27. Alexander opted to go with just three shooters in game two but Hadley\u2019s injury means she will have four players across each line for Saturday\u2019s clash. The match is expected to draw at least 14,000 spectators, which would be the biggest netball attendance anywhere in the world this year.</p> <p>Wing attack Laura Scherian\u2019s impressive introduction to international play and the increasing influence of fellow Queenslander and shooter Gretel Tippett have been two big positives for Alexander through the games in New Zealand. Tippett continued her impressive shooting form from the World Cup, missing just two of 49 shots across the first two CC matches and her all-round play in Auckland was excellent. Scherian handled the step up with aplomb after getting her Diamonds chance at age 31.</p> <p>\u201cShezzie is amazing. She doesn\u2019t look like a debutant at all , she\u2019s very wise,\u201d Tippett told AAP. \u201cShe\u2019s my little general out the front; she calls the shots and I love that.\u201d</p> <p>The fortunes of both have risen considerably since 2014, when they were playing for Queensland Fusion in the domestic second-tier ANL.<br></p> <p>\u201c(Tippett) is starting to get that consistency with her game; we\u2019re using her strengths in a more consistent way as well,\u201d Alexander said. \u201c(With) Laura Scherian, it\u2019s possibly the Queensland angle, they have a nice combination together and that was very complementary in the first two Tests and hopefully that will be what we see in the future.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5daa8bc88f08993584c8950c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-19T04:12:36.209Z\">5.12am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>WBBL: </strong>Unfortunately it looks like I put the commentator\u2019s (blogger\u2019s?) curse on Erin Fazackerley earlier, she fell to fellow Erin (Osborne) almost immediately after for 46. No one else has been able to put on a big score for the Hurricanes, but Fran Wilson with 17 off 14 is building. With only four overs remaining, she needs to get a move on. The Hurricanes are 126-5 after 17 overs.</p> <p>Things haven\u2019t improved for the Renegades, who are now 37-4 after 10 overs. Stafanie Taylor took two wickets in her first over for the Strikers, shifting there from the Sydney Thunder this season. Courtney Webb and Jess Duffin are batting cautiously at the crease now, looking to establish a partnership and hopefully hit some late runs to mount a defendable score.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/WBBL/status/1185405584004108288\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Stafanie Taylor picks up two wickets from her first over in blue! \ud83d\ude31 <br><br>Renegades 4-27 after 7 <a href=\"https://t.co/zoWHD9ulwW\">https://t.co/zoWHD9ulwW</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WBBL05?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#WBBL05</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/HovkfJVhUt\">pic.twitter.com/HovkfJVhUt</a></p>&mdash; Rebel Women&#39;s Big Bash League (@WBBL) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WBBL/status/1185405584004108288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 19, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5daa895f8f08142786c4f019\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-19T04:03:29.216Z\">5.03am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">World Cup Nines: Australia Women 42-4 England Women</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Australia\u2019s women continue their dominance, easily accounting for England at Bankwest Stadium. England were slightly ahead in the standings on for and against, but Australia will now leapfrog them into first place and have sealed a place in the final. Australia shared the scoring around, with seven tries coming from seven different try-scorers. It was a dominant display from start to finish, with the English unable to match the pace or skill of their southern rivals.

The big story has been Lebanon\u2019s win over England in the men\u2019s competition, leaving England vulnerable to an early exit from the tournament.</p> <p><strong>From AAP:</strong></p> <p>England are perilously close to becoming the first shock exit of the World Cup nines after a 16-13 loss to lowly Lebanon. Without their boycotting NRL stars, the Cedars claimed what will likely be the biggest upset of the weekend against an England side full of NRL and Super League talent.</p> <p>Brothers Reece and Travis Robinson starred, the latter scoring a double with the first coming from a nice flick pass from his sibling. The win was Lebanon\u2019s second of the tournament after also stunning France on the opening night, meaning they will qualify for the finals if they beat Wales on Saturday afternoon.</p> <p>That would blow England out of the tournament, meaning they would miss the semi-finals of a rugby league World Cup event in any format for the first time in their history. </p> <p>\u201cWe probably didn\u2019t start well. Some of the tries we let in defensively weren\u2019t our best effort. That\u2019s where we let ourselves down there,\u201d England star Gareth Widdop said. \u201cThey played some good football.

      "bodyText": "A lot going on this Saturday - so much for the post-winter codes lull. The WBBL has just finished up at Drummoyne Oval, with the Sydney Sixers in all sorts after the Brisbane Heat ripped through their top six. It was a decisive win for the defending premiers who were excellent with the bat and ball - Laura Harris took out player of the match, while also proclaiming herself \u201cHarris of the Match\u201d, pipping sister Grace for that gong. There were big wins for the Hobart Hurricanes and the Adelaide Strikers earlier in the day - Chloe Tryon the star for the Tasmanians with a stoinking 46 off 18 with the bat. At the World Nines, Australia and New Zealand shared the finals glory with a win-a-piece, Australia winning the men\u2019s final, while the Kiwi Ferns pulled a minor upset in the women\u2019s final with a great win from behind. In the A-League it was honours shared in Western United\u2019s first home game from Geelong, as they nearly pipped the premiers Perth Glory, who had the coach\u2019s son, Kristian Popovic, to thank for their point. The F3 derby huffed and puffed - but home side Mariners couldn\u2019t find a second after Milan Duric\u2019s sumptuous opener. Plenty more elsewhere - a Sheffield Shield century for Steve Smith, who just doesn\u2019t know how to not score runs these days. No doubt lots more we\u2019ve missed - thanks for your company! The big news today of course: Australia are out of the Rugby World Cup. It\u2019s the old enemy, England, that delivers the coup-de-gr\u00e2ce. The Wallabies played some scintillating stuff at times, and some loose stuff at others. Our chief rugby writer Bret Harris with his final assessment of the campaign - and he doesn\u2019t mince his words: All square in the end. They rattled the crossbar a few times, the Mariners, while in added-time it was Dimi Petratos with a chance to win it at the death for Newcastle. Jets dominated possession and finished stronger in the second half, but Central Coast still had their chances. You\u2019d imagine coach Stajcic would settle for the point given how they had one snatched away in round one, while Merrick may have preferred the three, as he side blew out some cobwebs after a first round bye. And there it is! It\u2019s the teenage prodigy, David Fifita who clinches it for Australia. You can\u2019t question that try - and it\u2019s Moses in at the end, but wonderful lead-up play. Worthy winners in the end, but huge question marks over the Feldt try. Madge Macguire doesn\u2019t look happy on the touchline in the NZ coaching strip, but on balance, they probably still earned it, the Kangaroos. One a piece - Australia win the men\u2019s final, NZ the women\u2019s! Nines Men\u2019s Final: Australia 17-10 New Zealand - second half, 5 to play: NZ look to get the \u201cgo-ahead\u201d try, but it breaks down and almost allows Josh Addo-Carr to launch a speedy counter-attack. Wade Graham gets Australia moving but he doesn\u2019t have the pace to get home - but they head to the corner, has Kyle Feldt grounded in the corner? He looked short of the line? They\u2019ve given it! Wow. Expect that to come back to haunt, if this one finishes close. 82 min: A big last ten minutes or so to come in the F3 derby - it\u2019s still scores locked 1-1. Is there a feeling that at this stage in the season both sides would prefer more not to lose than to win? Stajcic was certainly aggrieved not to get something from the opening round against the Wanderers after a late VAR penalty against his side, but how much do Merrick and his men want all three points? Nines Men\u2019s Final: Australia 13-10 New Zealand - HT: So! We\u2019re away, and what a lively half it\u2019s started in the Nines men\u2019s final. New Zealand get first blood down the flank, but Australia hit straight back with a try from the \u201cbonus zone\u201d to move to 7-4. The superb Jamayne Isaako then pins the ears back and scores in the corner for NZ, only to convert brilliantly as well with the drop-kicked conversion. Before Australia got the last laugh of the half. They almost duffed this, the Kangaroos, but how\u2019s the turn of pace from Moses to finish. Fine work. 75 min: Skipper Matt Simon looks to throw himself around (uncharacteristically). Oh, and look - he\u2019s picked up a yellow - and it\u2019s his 50th in the A-League! You certainly know what you get from the passionate striker. Love it. There is also WBBL action underway, where it\u2019s the fearsome duo of Alyssa Healy and Ellyse Perry at the crease for the Sydney Sixers as they start their run chase. Beth Mooney got Brisbane Heat flying with a quick-fire 50, before Laura Harris smacked a remarkable 36 off 17 finish with a respectable 6-165 off 20. Some handy work here during that innings from Healy as well. Enjoy. 68 min: And Stajcic does eventually shuffle his pack, but it\u2019s a defender Ruon Tongyik that comes on for Dylan Fox, not Silvera further up the field. What we have we hold for the Mariners? They\u2019re similar players, so no significant tactical adjustment you fancy. We still have the Nines men\u2019s final to come - we\u2019ll try and bring you some of that shortly, but if you weren\u2019t sure how much it meant to the Kiwi Ferns to win the women\u2019s clash, check out these celebrations: 62 min: The Jets starting to grow a little ascendent here - Alen Stajcic ponders his options, and sends the talented youngster Sam Silvera to warm up. The pressure is rising on the home side, Petratos, Ugarkovic and Ridenton starting to dominate the midfield. Goal! Central Coast 1-1 Newcastle (Petratos) 56 min: Petratos steps up once again - he goes the same way, again, but this time he beats Birighitti! If the crowd weren\u2019t involved before they are now. It\u2019s really running hot inside Gosford Stadium, and can you blame the home fans? 55 min: Oh my - we\u2019ve gone upstairs - Birighitti strayed fractionally off his line to stop the penalty, and we\u2019ll have the penalty re-taken, and the \u2018keeper is handed a yellow card! Ooph, that\u2019s harsh, isn\u2019t it? It was a brilliant save - but the video did suggest he went marginally early. 52 min: Penalty! They do get the whistle this time, the Jets, as Giancarlo Gallifuoco rises for a header and just deflects the ball off the head of an opponent with the hand. Up steps Dimi Petratos - but Birighitti saves it! Brilliant reactions from the Mariners custodian. 50 min: And another VAR shout at the other end - Clisby gives the ball away poorly and Steven Ugarkovic goes to ground in the box under the challenge of Kye Rowles. Was there sufficient contact there? Referee and video men say: no. 48 min: Close! Lovely work from Duric who finds De Silva - and the young u23 national team star almost fashions a second for the Mariners. He skipped past a would be tackler or two before playing the one-two with Duric, but his delightful cross was prevented, nearly off the goal line, by the experienced Topor-Stanley. A lovely passage for the home side. A-League - second half! But, back to the A-League, and we\u2019re underway once more in the F3 derby. It\u2019s a half-time substitute a piece - the skipper Matt Simon replaces Jordan Murray for the home side, and young English fullback Bobby Burns is on for Johnny Koutroumbis for the Jets. Poor old Michael Cheika - his old mate Eddie Jones really does have the wood over him. It\u2019s a bit too soon to talk about what this all means for him post-World Cup, but needless to say it\u2019s a bitter pill to swallow. Not that media figures from across the ditch are feeling too sympathetic. And if you just need Rugby World Cup action hooked into your veins, there is of course the minor matter of New Zealand v Ireland coming up as well. The irrepressible Barry Glendenning is the man on the keyboard there: And, I\u2019ve tried my best not to talk about it, but in that minor matter of the Rugby World Cup match, the Wallabies have not been victorious. Here\u2019s Robert Kitson from the ground in Japan with the match report: A-League: Central Coast 1-0 Newcastle Jets - HT: So a rugged clash, as you\u2019d expect in the F3 derby, where the whistle\u2019s just gone for half-time. Duric\u2019s quality strike the difference. Newcastle Jets have enjoyed a fair share of the possession but they\u2019ve struggled to fashion too many clear-cut chances in the face of some desperate Mariners defence. Fitzgerald with a chance or two against his old club - wouldn\u2019t that light the touchpaper, if the former CCM man bagged an equaliser. Wowee, wow. They\u2019ve hung on and done it, New Zealand. They were well-beaten 22-8 in the pool stage yesterday, but when it really mattered they\u2019ve stood tall, the Kiwi Ferns. One down, one to go - can New Zealand make it a clean sweep with a win in the men\u2019s final as well? Nines Women\u2019s Final - Australia 15-17 New Zealand - 5 to play: It\u2019s New Zealand with first blood after the break, as Jules Newman finds the corner. Corbyn McGregor then with too much pace round the outside to put the Jillaroos back in front. But it\u2019s quick work from dummy half from Maynard that gets the Ferns back in front. Can they get home from here, the trans-Tasman rivals?! Nines Women\u2019s Final - Australia 8-7 New Zealand - HT: Brigginshaw looks at the clock and sizes her options. The skipper puts it on the toe and tries to catch the Kiwi Ferns on their heels, but they tidy up at the back. \u201cWe have to play smart now, tackle one and two - no risky balls\u201d is the word from the Ferns skipper. Let\u2019s see what they can come up with this second half. Let\u2019s take you to the women\u2019s Nines final now - hopefully we can follow that to the end. It\u2019s Australia v New Zealand, and it\u2019s 8-7 to the Jillaroos with three minutes to play before half-time. It\u2019s two tries to one for the host nation, as Brigginshaw looks to marshall her troops. They\u2019ve dominated possession, Australia, but New Zealand are finding considerable success on a fast break. 17 min: A talking point as the VAR takes a good look at a potential handball in the box by Johnny Koutroumbis. And even those it\u2019s clearly struck the hand, the verdict is that he was not \u201cmaking himself bigger\u201d with the arm. It\u2019s an area of some real unclarity and unhappiness, handballs under VAR, but that\u2019s the line here. And it will be an Australian-New Zealand final in the men\u2019s Nines as well - as the Kangaroos hop away from a determined Samoa late on. 25-8 the final score. At risk of sounding a party pooper t\u2019d have called this last one held, but credit the persistence from Frizzell. Goal! Central Coast Mariners 1-0 Newcastle Jets (Duric) 5 min: Can you believe this! We\u2019re barely minutes underway and it\u2019s their star Serbian midfielder who\u2019s sparked the contest. First blood, Mariners - and he becomes the first player to start their carreer scoring in consecutive games for Central Coast since, of all names, Asdrubal! It was an exquisite volley from the former Vojvodina man - he released Jordan Murray with a raking cross-field ball, before the return found the Serbian unmarked, and he lashed it home past Glen Moss. Terrific strike. Kickoff! 1 min: We\u2019re in Gosford, home of the Mariners, where Newcastle are making their first appearance of the season follow their opening round bye. A 48th F3 derby. Hasn\u2019t it grown into a great fixture over the years. Two former Mariners, Matt Millar and Nick Fitzgerald will start against their old club. The former, you\u2019ll recall left in pretty acrimonious circumstances. We\u2019re at half-time in the Nines second semi-final, where Australia are leading 11-4 against Samoa. A terrific late try from Josh Addo-Carr really getting Australia going - how\u2019s the skillset here, watch and enjoy: Now, our feature match for tonight\u2019s Sportwatch is about to kickoff - it\u2019s the F3 Derby in the A-League, Central Coast Mariners v Newcastle Jets. Alen Stajcic did start his reign at the Mariners late last season with the derby, which Central Coast stunning won 3-2, with all five goals coming in the second half. Can we dare to hope for a repeat of those dramatics tonight? We\u2019re in the first semi-final in the men\u2019s Nines where England are battling New Zealand (Australia will face Samoa in the second semi). They\u2019ve just registered their first try, England, having gone behind 16-0. About 20m out and with their tails up, the northern hemisphere side had a shot at really making it interesting, but bombed a good chance, only to see Jamayne Isaako sprint away 70m and hit straight back for NZ. 22-6 the current score. Rugby Union - England 17-9 Australia - HT: As mentioned, the big fixture today comes from the Rugby World Cup where it\u2019s the Wallabies trailing England at the break. An intercept try a real kick in the teeth for Michael Cheika\u2019s side, who for large portions have looked very good. Follow that all play-by-play with Lee Calvert: No! There\u2019s the final whistle. It\u2019s honours even and reputations in-tact. They\u2019re good off-field friends, Tony Popovic and Mark Rudan, so they\u2019ll have to settle for the point each. But importantly for the home fans on the A-League\u2019s newest club, no loss on their home debut. 6,888 the official crowd figure in Geelong - not too shabby for a club that\u2019s only existed &gt; 2 years. By all accounts a pulsating second half, and there was a goal disallowed for Besart Berisha - could they have taken all three, the new kids? And some better news for Perth Glory in the A-League, where it\u2019s been a telling contribution from Popovic! No, not coach and former Socceroo Tony - but son Kristian who has fired his first ever A-League goal, to level the ledger for the premiers. Western United 1-1 Perth Glory. Is there a final twist left in this one? And a few scandalous yarns doing the rounds today - firstly from the A-League a who-dunnit worthy of Carmen Sandiego even - the mystery of Perth Glory\u2019s missing kit. The club launched a remarkable broadside on Twitter: Before Qantas replied: Wherever the truth lies, they\u2019ve turned out in their all-white training kit, Perth, and it\u2019s not appearing to work for them. Shades of Alex Ferguson and the infamous United grey kit? Only difference is they\u2019ve got nothing to change back into for the second half, the reigning premiers. And another emphatic win at the Nines - New Zealand have sunk England 33-4 in the final group game of the women\u2019s draw, so it will be an all trans-Tasman final in about an hour or two\u2019s time. Game on! As mentioned - the Rugby World Cup knockout match between Australia and England has just got underway. Check out Lee Calvert\u2019s liveblog for play-by-play coverage of that one. And we do have a breakthrough in the A-League - where it\u2019s a first home goal for Western United, and it\u2019s their marquee midfielder, the Greek international Panegiotis Kone for smashes one home from outside the box! Western United 1-0 Perth Glory. A-League - Western United 0-0 Perth Glory - HT: No goals out in Geelong in the new kids on the block\u2019s inaugural home game. Plenty to like from both sides with star playmakers Alessandro Diamanti and Diego Castro trying to pull the strings for their respective halves but very little goalbox action thus far. Just the two shots on target from Perth, who almost took the lead inside two minutes with a sumptuous buildup just avoiding Bruno Fornaroli at the far post. Some result updates from the Nines. The Aussie men have finalised their group matches following a convincing 26-0 win over Papua New Guinea, thanks to tries to Daly Cherry-Evans, Campbell Graham x2, AJ Brimson and Jai Arrow - the last probably the pick of the action: And the Jillaroos have just completed their final group game, also against PNG, and it was another emphatic showing. A double to Tiani Penitani who takes her tournament tally to four, with Isobel Kelly and Ally Brigginshaw also in the thick of the action. A late consolation try for PNG maintaining their record of having scored in every game, 30-6 the final score there. The Australian men will now progress to a semi-final date with England, the Australian women will now look ahead to the final, where they\u2019ll play the winner of England or New Zealand. Now, as mentioned there\u2019s plenty floating about on the sports front at the moment. We\u2019ve got A-League action, Nines, a game or two of WBBL, but most eyes I imagine will be flicking towards the crunch Rugby World Cup knockout rounds showdown between Australia and England. First whistle is about half an hour away there, and Lee Calvert is your eyes on the prize in our match-specific liveblog: Evening all - and thanks Megan for another sterling shift. Great to bond over all things Carmen Sandiego. Apparently there\u2019s a Netflix show now so that the young\u2019uns can relive one of the seminal classics of our generation (Gen X/Millennial cusp?). \u201cHere are the de-tails of your next case\u201d. Magic. Incidentally a fun fact about the word sterling - I recently read Mark Kurlansky\u2019s classic book, Cod, where he suggested the name came into English through ancient salted fish trade with the \u201cEasterlings\u201d, Germanic traders around the Baltic Sea. Apparently there are rival theories that challenge that, but it\u2019s certainly a more romantic interpretation. Sportwatch, eh? You came for Nines updates, you left learning about the history of currency. Next week maybe we\u2019ll do famous dead languages, what ever happened to Livonian etc. Well that\u2019s goodbye from me, I now leave you in the very capable hands of fellow Carmen Sandiego fan Richard Parkin to see you through the rest of the night. He\u2019s bringing you some more Nines, even more WBBL and some A-League, just to mix things up. Auf Widersehen! It wasn\u2019t a happy day for the Melbourne teams today, as the Renegades\u2019 117 proved to be not quite enough at Karen Rolton Oval in Adelaide. Sophie Devine was the standout batter for the Strikers and was awarded player of the match, with 72* off 45. Katie Mack came in for a quick-fire 10 from five balls at the end, in a wonderful cameo to finish off the game. Lea Tahuhu and Maitlan Brown were the wicket-takers for the Renegades, grabbing two each. While only Claire Koski and Georgia Wareham were particularly expensive, the Renegades weren\u2019t bowling tightly enough for such a small total. Stafanie Taylor will be pleased with her off-season move from the Thunder, starting with a decisive bowling performance for her new club. A big win for the Hurricanes in their first match of WBBL05. After dominant batting performances from Erin Fazackerley (46 off 33) and Chloe Tryon (46 off 18), the Tasmanians were well set up to defend their total. Getting Elyse Villani lbw for a duck was the perfect start and they denied the Stars the chance to get into a rhythm, taking regular wickets. Belinda Vakarewa (3-27) and former Thunder star Maisy Gibson (3-26) did the damage and the Stars couldn\u2019t catch them. Tess Flintoff gave it her best shot, managing 34* off 22, but it wasn\u2019t enough for the women in green. The Stars will get another shot tomorrow however, as the two teams meet again - same bat place, (almost) same bat time (it starts at 2pm instead of 1:30pm). Netball: If you thought I was finished plugging my own articles, do I have news for you! Here\u2019s another - this one is on Lisa Alexander and her record-breaking 100 games as coach of the Australian Diamonds. The Constellation Cup continues tomorrow and I\u2019ll be bringing you a match report live from Sydney, so check back in for that one. W-League: My colleague Samantha Lewis wrote an excellent analysis on the questions posed by an independent W-League this week. Lots of good talking points in there, I highly recommend having a read of it. World Cup Nines: Time to check back in on the best World Cup you didn\u2019t know was a World Cup. In the men\u2019s competition Lebanon couldn\u2019t keep up their giant-killing form, falling to Wales 14-25. England made short work of France, winning 38-4, while the Cook Islands moved into second place in Pool C after beating Fiji 12-10. Samoa are ahead of Tonga at half-time, leading 18-10. Australia take on Papua New Guinea at 5:15pm. The women\u2019s competition returns to the field this evening, with final pool games featuring Australia v Papua New Guinea and England v New Zealand, with the final to follow. Racing: The fortuitously named Yes Yes Yes has won the Everest at Royal Randwick today. I\u2019m sure the owners were screaming that name quite loudly as the horse crossed the finish line. Funny name for a horse really. I\u2019d probably have called him Elizabeth. Or Mary. WBBL: Checking back in on the Big Bash and there isn\u2019t a whole lot of big bashing, or bashing of any description, going on right now to be quite frank. The Stars are looking stilted at 68-5 after 10 overs. The loss of Elyse Villani for a duck was a huge blow for Green Melbourne and they have a way to go to chase down the 164 that the Hurricanes put on. Belinda Vakarewa and Maisy Gibson (another former Thunder player) have done the damage with the ball, taking two wickets each, with Heather Knight picking up one. The Strikers would have been confident chasing down the Renegades\u2019 117 but have struggled get going early, losing Susie Bates for 2 and Tahlia McGrath for a duck. Lea Tahuhu has both wickets for Red Melbourne so far, with sensational figures of 2-4. The Strikers are 25-2 after four overs. Rugby World Cup: There is no doubt that the Wallabies go into tonight\u2019s quarter final against England as the underdogs. The Australians have been less than convincing at the World Cup so far, but that puts the pressure squarely on England. Bret Harris analysed the Wallabies as underdogs for us this week, looking at the potential headache they could cause for their English rivals. Tokyo 2020: We ran a sneak peek behind the scenes at some of Tokyo\u2019s stunning Olympic venues. While Japan has been all about rugby lately, the attention will soon turn to the world\u2019s biggest multi-sport showcase and the city is ready. W-League: It was getting a little worrying, but the draw has finally been released! Much like the Super Netball this year, the competition will take an international break, but fortunately not as long as the netball one was. Hopefully the Matildas players are given plenty of support and recovery opportunities as they work through a crowded calendar. WBBL: Melbourne Renegades 117-7 at the innings break Despite the best efforts of Jess Duffin, who pulled together 44 from 32 balls, the Renegades look to be in a spot of bother in Adelaide. However the second half of their innings was much improved and they will take some confidence from their refusal to fall apart after things looked catastrophic early. West Indies captain Stafanie Taylor looks to be the signing of the season, she was sensational for her new club, finishing with 3-26 from her four overs. Sheffield Shield: Checking in on the Shield games for a spell and Queensland are creeping up toward\u2019s South Australia\u2019s total, currently 82 runs behind at 139-4 after Marnus Labuschagne was dismissed for 32. Lunch at the WACA and the Western Australians are 18-1 and looking to build after the early loss of Cam Bancroft for 10. Sam Whiteman and Shaun Marsh will return to the crease after the lunch break, chasing Victoria\u2019s total of 341 in the first innings. Meanwhile Steve Smith has reached his half century at Drummoyne Oval, batting with Moises Henriques. NSW are 113-2, chasing Tasmania\u2019s first innings score of 268. Realityreigns in the comments isn\u2019t too excited about all this delightful summer sport we\u2019ve got on. I feel like maybe we need some more summer vibes to get them excited about this wonderful time of year. Some Calvin Harris might help. Rugby World Cup: Don\u2019t forget, we have a big night of action from Japan coming up with the Australia v England and New Zealand v Ireland coming up later tonight. We\u2019ll be live blogging both matches, so stick around for those. While you\u2019re waiting, we\u2019ve had some great coverage from our rugby writers. This piece from Andy Bull about how rugby has won over \u201cniwaka fans\u201d is a great place to start. WBBL: Hobart Hurricanes 164-5 at the innings break Well, a few overs ago I urged Fran Wilson to get a move on and, while she did indeed oblige, it was young all-rounder Chloe Tryon who really took it to the bowlers, smashing 46 off 18. While they looked in danger after Fazackerley\u2019s dismissal, Tryon turned their innings around and now they have a total they will be confident they can defend. The Stars have plenty of firepower in their ranks though, and will look to come out firing. Should be a cracker of a second innings, so stay tuned! Netball: News just in that Diamonds\u2019 mid-courter Paige Hadley has been ruled out of tomorrow\u2019s Constellation Cup match between Australia and New Zealand. It\u2019s a blow for the Sydneysider who has had a huge year, being selected for the Netball World Cup and leading the NSW Swifts to victory in the Super Netball last month. From AAP: Australia will be without experienced midcourter Paige Hadley for the remainder of the Constellation Cup netball series, after she fractured a wrist in game two on Wednesday. Going into Sunday\u2019s third game of the series at Sydney\u2019s Qudos Bank Arena, the Diamonds and Silver Ferns are locked at 1-1 after two matches in New Zealand. Diamonds\u2019 coach Lisa Alexander said Australia wouldn\u2019t bring in a replacement for Hadley as they had picked 13 rather than the normal 12 in the squad, which included an extra midcourter. \u201cWe really feel for Paige, especially given she would have been playing in front of her home crowd tomorrow,\u201d Alexander said on Saturday. \u201cTo be losing her from the team for the remaining two matches of the series isn\u2019t ideal but we\u2019re confident we have the depth within our group to get the job done.\u201d A win on Sunday would go a long way toward securing Australia a ninth Constellation Cup series in 10 years, with the final match to be played in Perth on October 27. Alexander opted to go with just three shooters in game two but Hadley\u2019s injury means she will have four players across each line for Saturday\u2019s clash. The match is expected to draw at least 14,000 spectators, which would be the biggest netball attendance anywhere in the world this year. Wing attack Laura Scherian\u2019s impressive introduction to international play and the increasing influence of fellow Queenslander and shooter Gretel Tippett have been two big positives for Alexander through the games in New Zealand. Tippett continued her impressive shooting form from the World Cup, missing just two of 49 shots across the first two CC matches and her all-round play in Auckland was excellent. Scherian handled the step up with aplomb after getting her Diamonds chance at age 31. \u201cShezzie is amazing. She doesn\u2019t look like a debutant at all , she\u2019s very wise,\u201d Tippett told AAP. \u201cShe\u2019s my little general out the front; she calls the shots and I love that.\u201d The fortunes of both have risen considerably since 2014, when they were playing for Queensland Fusion in the domestic second-tier ANL. \u201c(Tippett) is starting to get that consistency with her game; we\u2019re using her strengths in a more consistent way as well,\u201d Alexander said. \u201c(With) Laura Scherian, it\u2019s possibly the Queensland angle, they have a nice combination together and that was very complementary in the first two Tests and hopefully that will be what we see in the future.\u201d WBBL: Unfortunately it looks like I put the commentator\u2019s (blogger\u2019s?) curse on Erin Fazackerley earlier, she fell to fellow Erin (Osborne) almost immediately after for 46. No one else has been able to put on a big score for the Hurricanes, but Fran Wilson with 17 off 14 is building. With only four overs remaining, she needs to get a move on. The Hurricanes are 126-5 after 17 overs. Things haven\u2019t improved for the Renegades, who are now 37-4 after 10 overs. Stafanie Taylor took two wickets in her first over for the Strikers, shifting there from the Sydney Thunder this season. Courtney Webb and Jess Duffin are batting cautiously at the crease now, looking to establish a partnership and hopefully hit some late runs to mount a defendable score. Australia\u2019s women continue their dominance, easily accounting for England at Bankwest Stadium. England were slightly ahead in the standings on for and against, but Australia will now leapfrog them into first place and have sealed a place in the final. Australia shared the scoring around, with seven tries coming from seven different try-scorers. It was a dominant display from start to finish, with the English unable to match the pace or skill of their southern rivals. It speaks volumes about the standard of the NRLW competition and the benefits to the women who compete in it. World Cup Nines: It\u2019s been a big two days of World Cup Nines action so far. The big story has been Lebanon\u2019s win over England in the men\u2019s competition, leaving England vulnerable to an early exit from the tournament. From AAP: England are perilously close to becoming the first shock exit of the World Cup nines after a 16-13 loss to lowly Lebanon. Without their boycotting NRL stars, the Cedars claimed what will likely be the biggest upset of the weekend against an England side full of NRL and Super League talent. Brothers Reece and Travis Robinson starred, the latter scoring a double with the first coming from a nice flick pass from his sibling. The win was Lebanon\u2019s second of the tournament after also stunning France on the opening night, meaning they will qualify for the finals if they beat Wales on Saturday afternoon. That would blow England out of the tournament, meaning they would miss the semi-finals of a rugby league World Cup event in any format for the first time in their history. \u201cWe probably didn\u2019t start well. Some of the tries we let in defensively weren\u2019t our best effort. That\u2019s where we let ourselves down there,\u201d England star Gareth Widdop said. \u201cThey played some good football. We nearly got it at the end there but didn\u2019t. We know we need to be better in the next game.\u201d WBBL: First to the cricket, which had a high scoring start to the season last night, with the Sydney Thunder unable to run down the total their cross town rivals, the Sydney Sixers, had amassed. It was a powerful display from Sixers\u2019 captain Ellyse Perry, who dominated with the bat and ball. Thunder veteran Alex Blackwell put up a good fight, but lacked support around her to chase the 192 that the women in magenta put on. First up today we have the Melbourne Stars taking on the Hobart Hurricanes in St Kilda. The Stars sent the Canes in and Tasmanians have got off to a decent start, currently 69/2 from 11 overs. Erin Fazackerley is doing most of the heavy lifting, with 43 off 29 balls. It\u2019s not such a happy start for the Melbourne Renegades against the Adelaide Strikers with both openers going cheaply, they\u2019re currently 15/2 from four overs. Megan Schutt has been the dangerwoman for the Strikers, taking both wickets at 2/9. And since we\u2019re talking about WBBL, why not have a read of my article from earlier in the week about reasons to get excited about the new standalone season? Hello and welcome to Saturday\u2019s edition of Sportwatch! And what a big night we have ahead of us. There\u2019s plenty of A-League and WBBL action happening tonight, plus we\u2019ll have our separate live blogs going for the big Australia v England and New Zealand v Ireland Rugby World Cup quarter finals. I\u2019ll be kicking us off and the always delightful Richard Parkin will take you into the evening. It\u2019s going to be a big one and as we\u2019re already up and running with the Rugby League Nines and the WBBL, let\u2019s get started!",

      "body": "<p>The Wallabies\u2019 played with great attacking spirit at the World Cup in Japan, but their lofty ambition exceeded their skill-level.</p> \n<p>Statistically, the Wallabies entered their quarter-final against England at Oita Stadium on Saturday as one of the most dominant attacking teams in the tournament in terms of tackle busts, line-breaks and metres gained. But Australia also committed the most turnovers of any team in the final eight, the Achilles heel that led to their record 40-16 defeat to England and early exit from the tournament.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2019/oct/19/england-v-australia-rugby-world-cup-2019-quarter-final-live\">England 40-16 Australia: Rugby World Cup 2019 \u2013 as it happened</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The Wallabies attempted to play a high-tempo, high-passing game, but did not have the skill level to execute their strategy. It was not from want of trying. The Wallabies poached former All Blacks skills coach Mick Byrne and worked hard on their skill execution over the last four years.</p> \n<p>But the Australians never quite managed to play with the pace and precision of the All Blacks or even Japan at this World Cup and could not eradicate the crucial turnovers from their game. The Wallabies enjoyed the majority of possession, 65 per cent, and the English were happy to let them have the ball, pressuring the men in gold into making costly mistakes.</p> \n<p>It was not so much that the Wallabies committed so many more turnovers than England, but it was the time and place they made them that ruined their game. Early in the game the Wallabies strung together 18 phases on attack in England\u2019s territory only for five-eighth Christian Lealiifano to lose the ball in contact, a sign of things to come.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"044e8d9b-bf7d-4cd9-bd3c-604e599c802b\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HgRshkuDA5I?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The Wallabies had a clear intent to keep the ball in hand, which was predictable for the English defence, mostly rock solid throughout the game. It was the Wallabies\u2019 determination to try to run the ball out of their own end, particularly in the first-half, which led to the first of England winger Jonny May\u2019s two tries.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/19/england-australia-rugby-world-cup-match-report\">England into World Cup semi-finals after bruising victory over Australia</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>When Wallabies tight-head prop Allan Alaalatoa dropped the ball in the 22 to give England a scrum in an attacking position the English shifted the ball to the right and then swung back to the left with May crossing over in the corner in the 17th minute. It was a try that could have been so easily avoided with a long, clearing kick, but that was not the way this Wallabies team played \u2013 and England knew it.</p> \n<p>May was over again less than three minutes later after outside centre Henry Slade intercepted a pass from Wallabies flanker David Pocock, which was intended for Lealiifano, who seemed unaware the ball was coming to him.</p> \n<p>As in all of their games at this World Cup the Wallabies had made another bad start, trailing 17-9 at halftime.

      "bodyText": "The Wallabies\u2019 played with great attacking spirit at the World Cup in Japan, but their lofty ambition exceeded their skill-level. Statistically, the Wallabies entered their quarter-final against England at Oita Stadium on Saturday as one of the most dominant attacking teams in the tournament in terms of tackle busts, line-breaks and metres gained. But Australia also committed the most turnovers of any team in the final eight, the Achilles heel that led to their record 40-16 defeat to England and early exit from the tournament. The Wallabies attempted to play a high-tempo, high-passing game, but did not have the skill level to execute their strategy. It was not from want of trying. The Wallabies poached former All Blacks skills coach Mick Byrne and worked hard on their skill execution over the last four years. But the Australians never quite managed to play with the pace and precision of the All Blacks or even Japan at this World Cup and could not eradicate the crucial turnovers from their game. The Wallabies enjoyed the majority of possession, 65 per cent, and the English were happy to let them have the ball, pressuring the men in gold into making costly mistakes. It was not so much that the Wallabies committed so many more turnovers than England, but it was the time and place they made them that ruined their game. Early in the game the Wallabies strung together 18 phases on attack in England\u2019s territory only for five-eighth Christian Lealiifano to lose the ball in contact, a sign of things to come. The Wallabies had a clear intent to keep the ball in hand, which was predictable for the English defence, mostly rock solid throughout the game. It was the Wallabies\u2019 determination to try to run the ball out of their own end, particularly in the first-half, which led to the first of England winger Jonny May\u2019s two tries. When Wallabies tight-head prop Allan Alaalatoa dropped the ball in the 22 to give England a scrum in an attacking position the English shifted the ball to the right and then swung back to the left with May crossing over in the corner in the 17th minute. It was a try that could have been so easily avoided with a long, clearing kick, but that was not the way this Wallabies team played \u2013 and England knew it. May was over again less than three minutes later after outside centre Henry Slade intercepted a pass from Wallabies flanker David Pocock, which was intended for Lealiifano, who seemed unaware the ball was coming to him. As in all of their games at this World Cup the Wallabies had made another bad start, trailing 17-9 at halftime. It was only England giving away kickable penalties in their red zone rather than conceding tries that kept the Wallabies remotely in the game. When Wallabies winger Marika Koroibete scored a spectacular try soon after the resumption of play, it looked as if Australia was right back in the game. Koroiebete received a long ball from fellow winger Reece Hodge and beat England fullback Elliot Daly with an in and away, but the score was just a flash in the pan for the Wallabies. England hit back with a try in the 47th minute to tight-head prop Kyle Sinckler, who ran into a huge gap off a cut-out pass from Farrell, regaining the eight-point margin. Farrell extended England\u2019s lead to 27-16 with a penalty goal in the 49th minute after the Wallabies collapsed a scrum. This had resulted from Alaalatoa being held by the defence after receiving a long, aimless pass from Lealiifano, another error which put the prop under pressure. The moment of truth arrived for the Wallabies around the 60th minute mark when they attacked the England line with a series of pick and goes. The Australians had to score or start to think about packing their bags to go home, but number eight Isi Naisarani had the ball ripped out of his clutches by Sinckler in a tackle on the ninth phase. That was just about it for the Wallabies. Critical errors at critical moments killed their campaign, so much of their pain self-inflicted. England winger Anthony Watson delivered the coup de grace when he intercepted yet another wayward long pass from Wallabies fullback Kurtley Beale to captain Michael Hooper and raced away. It was a desperate measure by a desperate team, but by this stage the Wallabies looked confused as to what to do, a situation that could not have been helped by the constant chopping and changing of the Australian backline throughout the tournament. In the end the Wallabies resembled a team with a strategy, but no tactics, up against a master tactician in England coach Eddie Jones, who knew exactly what was coming and prepared meticulously to counter it.",

Mas, who governed Catalonia between 2010 and 2016 and set the region on its collision course with Madrid by staging a symbolic, non-binding independence referendum five years ago, acknowledged that mistakes had been made. The current crisis began when Mas\u2019s successor, Carles Puigdemont, announced a unilateral independence referendum in June 2017.

Kitteridge, an elderly widow by now and still living in Maine, spots a former pupil in a diner \u2013 the girl has become famous, she is the poet laureate \u2013 and approaches her to revive the connection. In the exchange that follows, one becomes aware of Strout\u2019s sympathetic range: she is Kitteridge, fawning over the celebrated writer while remaining convinced of her own superiority; she is Andrea, the poet, regarding her old teacher with a cold eye; and of course she is the novelist herself, exhibiting, in the dynamic between these women, the ruthless gaze of the writer on her prey. \u201cThat was the first story that I wrote for <em>Olive, Again</em>,\u201d says Strout, cheerfully. \u201cShe just showed up and I saw her nosing her car into the marina; and I thought: Oh man, she\u2019s back.\u201d She laughs with pure joy.</p> <p>Olive Kitteridge, one of the great, difficult women of American literature, became instantaneously beloved when the book was first published, somewhat to the surprise of her creator.

Her persona, when fully charged, doesn\u2019t brook any compromise and tends towards the invulnerable, which is why, when she has her feelings hurt, it is almost too much for the reader to bear. In the first book, this took the form of Olive at her son\u2019s wedding, overhearing her daughter-in-law mock her dress. In <em>Olive, Again</em>, it is the moment when Andrea the poet assassinates Olive in a poem, and a slew of small slights and denigrations. \u201cGod, she was a strange woman,\u201d thinks Jack, the man who becomes her second husband, much to his surprise. <em>Olive Kitteridge</em> sold more than a million copies and won the 2009 Pulitzer prize, but to the book\u2019s fans, its greater achievement was to take a certain ornery type, eccentric and ungainly, and make her seem noble.</p> <p>Strout, who continues to be mildly baffled by the success of the book, is grateful that it came late in her career; she was 53 when <em>Olive</em> <em>Kitteridge</em> was published, \u201cand thank God I wasn\u2019t 23. Because at that point I\u2019d had so many years of isolation and working and just slogging through, that although I was grateful, I was far, far too old to be changed\u201d.</p> <p>Ten years later, we are in her apartment in Manhattan, where she and her husband James, a retired lawyer, live half the time, spending the other half at their house in Maine. They married in 2011 after meeting at one of Strout\u2019s book events (her first husband, Martin, was a public defender; they divorced after 20 years together). Most of Strout\u2019s work, starting with <em>Amy and Isabelle</em>, published in 2001, and ending with <em>Olive Kitteridge</em>, was written in Brooklyn, where Strout raised her daughter, Zarina, now 35 and working as a playwright. \u201cShe was my only kid and I just pathologically loved her,\u201d she says. But while the city nourished her life for decades, as a writer it was undoubtedly Maine that made her.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ce23e3ded8b993fe350761069d60d550a6017de9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ce23e3ded8b993fe350761069d60d550a6017de9/0_281_2331_2911/801.jpg\" alt=\"Frances McDormand as Olive Kitteridge in the 2014 TV series.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Frances McDormand as Olive Kitteridge in the 2014 TV series.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/HBO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The gap between a character\u2019s persona and their inner workings is everywhere on display in Strout\u2019s books. For Olive, it is there in a moment of existential panic when, seeing her grandson\u2019s abandoned red scarf on the floor, she realises with a sudden pang that she has failed as a mother. In her fifth novel, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/05/my-name-is-lucy-barton-by-eliabeth-strout-review\" title=\"\"><em>My Name Is Lucy Barton</em></a>, the story of a writer living in New York and her mother in Illinois, it is in the gap between the narrator\u2019s polished life in the city and the memory of her spartan, violent childhood. For Strout herself, for a long time, it was the role occupied by Maine in her psyche.</p> <p>As in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/nov/03/featuresreviews.guardianreview27\" title=\"\">Elizabeth Gaskell\u2019s <em>Cranford</em></a>, the apparent smallness of the lives conjured by Strout \u2013 small town folk doing small town things \u2013 makes the movements within them seem larger. Strout always starts off with a scene. \u201cI learned that years ago, when my daughter was small and I only had a couple of hours: OK, if I can get a scene down with a heartbeat to it, then it will connect with others eventually. So when I write a scene, I try to use whatever is most urgent in me at that moment and transpose it into a character, so that it will be a living thing that\u2019s real.\u201d The scenes are always sequential and she often gets stuck. \u201cOh, all the time. And I just keep writing different scenes, keep literally scratching them out and lots of them end up on the floor. And then I\u2019ll realise oh, this works, and this works with it.\u201d</p> <p>Strout does regret very well, and disappointment \u2013 the aching sadness of Olive\u2019s bad relationship with Christopher, her son. She\u2019s also good at the drive-by observation that doesn\u2019t compact into a teachable moment, and at upending expectation to sometimes shocking effect. In one scene in the new book, a teenage girl permits a man with dementia to observe her touching herself up and, rather than feeling molested by his voyeurism, feels oddly empowered. It\u2019s a risky scene but, says Strout, \u201cI think that a part of me is always trying to write against the grain; I don\u2019t mean the political correctness grain, but you\u2019re always trying to look for the areas that are not obvious. So for her to actually do this, and feel important as a result of it, is going against the grain. That\u2019s not why I did it, but it\u2019s an interesting aspect of a human experience.\u201d</p> <p>It took Strout a long time to realise that Maine was her subject. She had spent so many years trying to leave the place that it seemed to her, in the first instance, perverse to return to it in her fiction. She grew up in a remote house outside Portland, where her father was a scientist \u2013 he studied parasites and tropical diseases \u2013 and her mother was an English teacher. She was an oddball in the family and in that part of the world. The New England character is, according to stereotype, shuttered, repressed, disinclined to outburst and Strout was none of these things. \u201cI used to joke that there had to be some kind of mutation of genes,\u201d she says. \u201cThere had to be! I have an older brother and he\u2019s very Maine, very reticent, very much a Yankee. And he\u2019ll tell you that himself, if he chose to speak to you. And I was always talking. My father would say to me at Thanksgiving \u2013 these joyless Thanksgivings, with a chicken with no spices and water not alcohol \u2013 and I can remember my father telling me: \u2018When I put my hand to my tie, it means you\u2019re talking too much.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Was she crushed by that? \u201cOh no! Not remotely. Every so often I\u2019d see: Oh! His hand\u2019s on his tie! And then I would just start to talk again.\u201d After attending college, first Bates, in Maine, and later law school at Syracuse University, Strout said to her mother that she\u2019d decided to be a writer. \u201cAnd her response was: \u2018Well you\u2019ve never had a shortage of words.\u2019\u201d In fact, Strout would be 45 before her first novel was published. The strange thing, she says, is that she never doubted that it would happen one day. After graduating, she went to live in the UK, in Oxford for a year where a boyfriend was living and worked at a pub in the city. \u201cAnd I tried to write stories but I had no success. I survived \u2013 I had a little bedsit, a room in a woman\u2019s house outside of town and it was very grim.

      "bodyText": "There is a moment in Olive, Again, the eagerly awaited follow-up to Olive Kitteridge, Elizabeth Strout\u2019s best-seller of 2008, in which the novelist\u2019s virtuosity is on full display. Kitteridge, an elderly widow by now and still living in Maine, spots a former pupil in a diner \u2013 the girl has become famous, she is the poet laureate \u2013 and approaches her to revive the connection. In the exchange that follows, one becomes aware of Strout\u2019s sympathetic range: she is Kitteridge, fawning over the celebrated writer while remaining convinced of her own superiority; she is Andrea, the poet, regarding her old teacher with a cold eye; and of course she is the novelist herself, exhibiting, in the dynamic between these women, the ruthless gaze of the writer on her prey. \u201cThat was the first story that I wrote for Olive, Again,\u201d says Strout, cheerfully. \u201cShe just showed up and I saw her nosing her car into the marina; and I thought: Oh man, she\u2019s back.\u201d She laughs with pure joy. Olive Kitteridge, one of the great, difficult women of American literature, became instantaneously beloved when the book was first published, somewhat to the surprise of her creator. Olive is blunt, erratic, bad-tempered. Her persona, when fully charged, doesn\u2019t brook any compromise and tends towards the invulnerable, which is why, when she has her feelings hurt, it is almost too much for the reader to bear. In the first book, this took the form of Olive at her son\u2019s wedding, overhearing her daughter-in-law mock her dress. In Olive, Again, it is the moment when Andrea the poet assassinates Olive in a poem, and a slew of small slights and denigrations. \u201cGod, she was a strange woman,\u201d thinks Jack, the man who becomes her second husband, much to his surprise. Olive Kitteridge sold more than a million copies and won the 2009 Pulitzer prize, but to the book\u2019s fans, its greater achievement was to take a certain ornery type, eccentric and ungainly, and make her seem noble. Strout, who continues to be mildly baffled by the success of the book, is grateful that it came late in her career; she was 53 when Olive Kitteridge was published, \u201cand thank God I wasn\u2019t 23. Because at that point I\u2019d had so many years of isolation and working and just slogging through, that although I was grateful, I was far, far too old to be changed\u201d. Ten years later, we are in her apartment in Manhattan, where she and her husband James, a retired lawyer, live half the time, spending the other half at their house in Maine. They married in 2011 after meeting at one of Strout\u2019s book events (her first husband, Martin, was a public defender; they divorced after 20 years together).

But while the city nourished her life for decades, as a writer it was undoubtedly Maine that made her. The gap between a character\u2019s persona and their inner workings is everywhere on display in Strout\u2019s books. For Olive, it is there in a moment of existential panic when, seeing her grandson\u2019s abandoned red scarf on the floor, she realises with a sudden pang that she has failed as a mother. In her fifth novel, My Name Is Lucy Barton, the story of a writer living in New York and her mother in Illinois, it is in the gap between the narrator\u2019s polished life in the city and the memory of her spartan, violent childhood. For Strout herself, for a long time, it was the role occupied by Maine in her psyche. As in Elizabeth Gaskell\u2019s Cranford, the apparent smallness of the lives conjured by Strout \u2013 small town folk doing small town things \u2013 makes the movements within them seem larger. Strout always starts off with a scene. \u201cI learned that years ago, when my daughter was small and I only had a couple of hours: OK, if I can get a scene down with a heartbeat to it, then it will connect with others eventually. So when I write a scene, I try to use whatever is most urgent in me at that moment and transpose it into a character, so that it will be a living thing that\u2019s real.\u201d The scenes are always sequential and she often gets stuck. \u201cOh, all the time. And I just keep writing different scenes, keep literally scratching them out and lots of them end up on the floor. And then I\u2019ll realise oh, this works, and this works with it.\u201d Strout does regret very well, and disappointment \u2013 the aching sadness of Olive\u2019s bad relationship with Christopher, her son. She\u2019s also good at the drive-by observation that doesn\u2019t compact into a teachable moment, and at upending expectation to sometimes shocking effect. In one scene in the new book, a teenage girl permits a man with dementia to observe her touching herself up and, rather than feeling molested by his voyeurism, feels oddly empowered. It\u2019s a risky scene but, says Strout, \u201cI think that a part of me is always trying to write against the grain; I don\u2019t mean the political correctness grain, but you\u2019re always trying to look for the areas that are not obvious. So for her to actually do this, and feel important as a result of it, is going against the grain. That\u2019s not why I did it, but it\u2019s an interesting aspect of a human experience.\u201d It took Strout a long time to realise that Maine was her subject.

She grew up in a remote house outside Portland, where her father was a scientist \u2013 he studied parasites and tropical diseases \u2013 and her mother was an English teacher. She was an oddball in the family and in that part of the world. The New England character is, according to stereotype, shuttered, repressed, disinclined to outburst and Strout was none of these things. \u201cI used to joke that there had to be some kind of mutation of genes,\u201d she says. \u201cThere had to be!

There was that ascent to fame when she sat horizontal on a sofa and said arch things on Gogglebox: we quite liked her then. After that there was the predictable <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/i-m-a-celebrity\">I\u2019m A Celeb \u2026 win</a> and the boom-and-bust fitness DVD: an unfurling of the bud. After that, the full bloom of Moffattism, where she was drafted by ITV as a sort of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/mar/30/ant-and-dec-reunited-punch-him-hug-him\">Ant and Dec</a> ancillary on Saturday Night Takeaway, turning them from a diarchy to a triumvirate by holding cue cards a lot and waving.</p> <p>Since then, a holy silence: the panel-show guest appearances, some sort of Instagram controversy about a skirt, a little McDonald\u2019s spon-con. And now this, The British Tribe Next Door (Tuesday, 9.15pm, Channel 4), one final swing of the Moffatt bat, a last attempt to cement her as beloved in the British canon, a sort of Kerry Katona/Princess Diana mash-up event; and a, uh, show where her and her family live in a faithfully rebuilt version of their County Durham terrace house in among the mud-and-stone huts of a Namibian tribe.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1a10d4f333b0391c7bf8e06d2a1850faa190265d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1a10d4f333b0391c7bf8e06d2a1850faa190265d/0_60_4000_2401/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Betty Ironing with Kandisiko\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Betty Ironing with Kandisiko.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Bloomer/Channel 4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I doubt I am the first to say this and I will not be the last, but: <em>what</em>? On paper, you would be right to think that this does not sound like a good idea. In practice, it is also very much not a good idea. The vague intention is: the Moffatts \u2013 dad Mark, who is boring; mum Betty, who is boring; the teen sister Ava-Grace is mostly mute \u2013 move in with the semi-nomadic Himba tribe in Namibia, and they stay in an exact replica of their home (frustratingly glossed over are the logistics of building an exact replica of Scarlett Moffatt\u2019s house in the middle of the Namib desert.

There was that ascent to fame when she sat horizontal on a sofa and said arch things on Gogglebox: we quite liked her then. After that there was the predictable I\u2019m A Celeb \u2026 win and the boom-and-bust fitness DVD: an unfurling of the bud. After that, the full bloom of Moffattism, where she was drafted by ITV as a sort of Ant and Dec ancillary on Saturday Night Takeaway, turning them from a diarchy to a triumvirate by holding cue cards a lot and waving. Since then, a holy silence: the panel-show guest appearances, some sort of Instagram controversy about a skirt, a little McDonald\u2019s spon-con. And now this, The British Tribe Next Door (Tuesday, 9.15pm, Channel 4), one final swing of the Moffatt bat, a last attempt to cement her as beloved in the British canon, a sort of Kerry Katona/Princess Diana mash-up event; and a, uh, show where her and her family live in a faithfully rebuilt version of their County Durham terrace house in among the mud-and-stone huts of a Namibian tribe. I doubt I am the first to say this and I will not be the last, but: what? On paper, you would be right to think that this does not sound like a good idea. In practice, it is also very much not a good idea. The vague intention is: the Moffatts \u2013 dad Mark, who is boring; mum Betty, who is boring; the teen sister Ava-Grace is mostly mute \u2013 move in with the semi-nomadic Himba tribe in Namibia, and they stay in an exact replica of their home (frustratingly glossed over are the logistics of building an exact replica of Scarlett Moffatt\u2019s house in the middle of the Namib desert.

He exalts men with weapons the way football fans deify their favorite quarterbacks.</p> <p>Generals have always occupied a special place in Trump\u2019s psyche. \u201cGeneral Mattis is a strong, highly dignified man,\u201d Trump <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/23/us/politics/trump-new-york-times-interview-transcript.html\">said</a> in 2016, shortly before he tapped Jim Mattis to be his defense secretary. \u201cYou know he\u2019s known as Mad Dog Mattis, right? Mad Dog for a reason.\u201d</p> <p>The generals, though, are through with him. Mattis, no longer defense secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/18/james-mattis-mocks-donald-trump-overrated-general\">ridiculed Trump on Thursday night</a> for dodging the Vietnam war and obsessing over fast food. The quips came after an infuriated Trump, on the defensive after Republicans and Democrats joined forces to condemn him for withdrawing troops from Syria, called Mattis the world\u2019s most \u201coverrated\u201d general.</p> <p>\u201cI have earned my spurs on the battlefield,\u201d Mattis <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/18/us/mattis-trump.html\">said</a>. \u201cDonald Trump earned his spurs in a letter from his doctor.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe only person in the military Mr Trump does not feel is overrated,\u201d he added, was Colonel Sanders, the founder of KFC.</p> <p>William McRaven, a retired four-star navy admiral who led the US special operations command under George W Bush and Barack Obama, piled on Friday in a scathing New York Times op-ed, criticizing Trump for abandoning the Kurds in Syria. \u201cIf our promises are meaningless, how will our allies ever trust us?\u201d he <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/17/opinion/trump-mcraven-syria-military.html\">wrote</a>. \u201cIf we can\u2019t have faith in our nation\u2019s principles, why would the men and women of this nation join the military?\u201d</p> <p>It must be embarrassing for a president to be so thoroughly rebuked by those he formerly worshiped.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump, like all strongmen, fetishizes military might. He dreams of parading armies down the streets of Washington. He exalts men with weapons the way football fans deify their favorite quarterbacks. Generals have always occupied a special place in Trump\u2019s psyche. \u201cGeneral Mattis is a strong, highly dignified man,\u201d Trump said in 2016, shortly before he tapped Jim Mattis to be his defense secretary. \u201cYou know he\u2019s known as Mad Dog Mattis, right? Mad Dog for a reason.\u201d The generals, though, are through with him. Mattis, no longer defense secretary, ridiculed Trump on Thursday night for dodging the Vietnam war and obsessing over fast food. The quips came after an infuriated Trump, on the defensive after Republicans and Democrats joined forces to condemn him for withdrawing troops from Syria, called Mattis the world\u2019s most \u201coverrated\u201d general. \u201cI have earned my spurs on the battlefield,\u201d Mattis said. \u201cDonald Trump earned his spurs in a letter from his doctor.\u201d \u201cThe only person in the military Mr Trump does not feel is overrated,\u201d he added, was Colonel Sanders, the founder of KFC. William McRaven, a retired four-star navy admiral who led the US special operations command under George W Bush and Barack Obama, piled on Friday in a scathing New York Times op-ed, criticizing Trump for abandoning the Kurds in Syria. \u201cIf our promises are meaningless, how will our allies ever trust us?\u201d he wrote. \u201cIf we can\u2019t have faith in our nation\u2019s principles, why would the men and women of this nation join the military?\u201d It must be embarrassing for a president to be so thoroughly rebuked by those he formerly worshiped. Trump is far from losing the Republican party, which now belongs entirely to him, but he has successfully shattered the link between the GOP and the traditional foreign policy establishment. Now facing impeachment, Trump has suddenly lent hawks like Lindsey Graham and Mitt Romney a rationale for one day voting against him. This does not mean his presidency is imperiled. And it does not mean that Trump\u2019s approach to foreign policy, too feckless to be regarded as doveish or even isolationist, should be scrapped for what Graham or the generals desire, which is more war, forever war, troops marching through ravaged nations until the end of the century and beyond.

The electronic prescription service (EPS) will be rolled out across England after a trial run in 60 GP practices and hundreds of pharmacies. At least 70% of all prescriptions are already being prescribed and dispensed through EPS and the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said it had received positive feedback from GPs and pharmacies. The first EPS went live in 2009 at a GP surgery and pharmacy in Leeds. Once the final stage is rolled out, nearly all prescriptions will be sent electronically. Under the electronic system, patients can get their medications by either nominating a pharmacy that will receive the details directly from their GP or receive a paper prescription with the digital barcode.

Paper prescriptions are not being scrapped as stated in the headline and introduction of an earlier version.",

Whether it will be enough to propel Eddie Jones\u2019s side all the way to World Cup glory remains to be seen but Australia could not withstand their second-half surge in this eventful quarter-final. For the first time since 2007 England are into the last four and Saturday\u2019s smackdown with New Zealand will be some collision.</p> \n<p>If the final margin was slightly harsh on a spirited Wallaby side it was hard-earned reward for England\u2019s well-organised defence and the last-quarter power lurking on their bench. It took until the final quarter to establish clear forward-control but a rampaging 46th-minute score by tight-head Kyle Sinckler had already pushed Australia towards their earliest World Cup exit for a dozen years.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/19/weve-not-played-our-best-england-can-improve-eddie-jones-tells-new-zealand\">\u2018We\u2019ve not played our best\u2019: England can improve, Eddie Jones tells New Zealand</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>If you had offered Eddie Jones a 24-point margin of victory against his homeland prior to the start he would have snatched your arm off above the elbow. The fact it was achieved with 36% of the ball and similar territory stats underlines the reality of modern-day rugby: possession is all very well but taking your chances when they arise is what really counts.</p> \n<p>In that regard Australia\u2019s 18 turnovers were a costly case of self-harm. So, too, were the two interception tries that ultimately wrecked any chance of Michael Cheika\u2019s side ending their recent grim sequence against the Poms. This was Jones\u2019s seventh successive win over his old Randwick teammate and, with the Cheika era drawing to a close, there can be no disputing the runaway winner of their personal duel.</p> \n<p>It was certainly a painful way for two great Wallaby servants, David Pocock and Will Genia, to go out. They can still bask in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/oct/03/england-australia-rugby-world-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">Australia\u2019s 33-13 victory over their old rivals at the 2015 World Cup</a> but that golden glow is now a fading memory. Only one of these two teams currently appears to be on an upward curve.</p> \n<p>Jones could still do with Jonny May, the scorer of the first two of England\u2019s four tries, recovering swiftly from an apparent hamstring tweak but in Sinckler and his young flankers, Tom Curry and Sam Underhill, the coach has some steadily improving individuals. Anthony Watson\u2019s late interception and Owen Farrell\u2019s 100% kicking contribution also helped scupper the Wallabies, despite the promise of their exciting new centre Jordan Petaia and the roadrunner pace of winger Marika Koroibete.</p> \n<p>A one-sided outcome, however, did not always look an inevitability. Australia had looked the brighter side initially, probing for gaps in England\u2019s defensive spacing and taking an early lead via Christian Lealiifano\u2019s first successful penalty. Their opponents took a while to make any kind of consistent front-foot impression before May\u2019s double whammy inside four minutes banished their jangling nerves.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"203cee992b8b0fb167484cd6767e8386e584d411\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/203cee992b8b0fb167484cd6767e8386e584d411/0_109_3793_2394/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kyle Sinckler runs through to score a critical try early in the second half after Australia had closed to within one point\" width=\"1000\" height=\"631\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kyle Sinckler runs through to score a critical try early in the second half after Australia had closed to within one point.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gabriel Bouys/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The first was the product of a destructive hard line down the middle by Manu Tuilagi, which sucked in the Australian defence and stretched the cover further out, allowing Farrell and Curry to put May over in the left corner. The Wallabies needed to strike back immediately but, instead, Pocock\u2019s attempted pass to Lealiifano was intercepted by Henry Slade whose chip ahead with his supposedly weaker right foot gave May another chance to show his searing pace.</p> \n<p>Farrell\u2019s second touchline conversion deepened the pain and left Australia to play catch-up rugby, precisely the scenario they had been anxious to avoid. To their credit Cheika\u2019s side did not panic, attacking with verve and using purposeful pick-and-go tactics to try and fluster England. In terms of the scoreboard it yielded only a couple more penalties for Lealiifano to one from Farrell but at no stage could England entirely relax.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b168122b-74a3-443f-a0a9-43da869acd9b\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>4 mins </b>After being penalised for early engagement at the first scrum, Sinckler receives several provocative pats on the head from laughing Aussie hooker Tolu Latu. The Wallabies clearly fancy Sinckler as a red-card candidate, and he looks rattled before England lock Maro Itoje pushes Latu away. Speaking on ITV, Sir Clive Woodward says: \u201cIn days of old, that could have all kicked off there. But Sinckler just turns away, and that is fantastic - he kept a cool head.\u201d&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>38 mins </b>After one scrum engagement, Sinckler is seen roaring in the direction of Romain Poite, far away on the other side of the pitch, because the south Londoner thinks Scott Sio is dropping the bind. He\u2019s a touch fortunate that referee J\u00e9r\u00f4me Garc\u00e8s doesn\u2019t intervene, and is penalised after the scrum is reset, Christian Lealiifano stroking over the penalty.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>46 mins </b>After Marika Koroibete\u2019s electrifying score, the Wallabies are back to within a point. Sinckler, running a magnificent line, collects a fizzing pass from fly-half Owen Farrell and barrels over. \u201cThat\u2019s the way the game is going, these young props can run with the ball,\u201d coach Eddie Jones says. \u201cHe ran a beautiful line - and that try put us in control.\u201d&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>60 mins </b>The Wallabies come hard again, wave after wave of attacks raining down on a tiring defence. Isi Naisarani and Samu Kerevi drive to within a metre of the try line, but Sinckler does brilliantly to rip the ball away. England are relieved after a period of sustained pressure, and they go on to dominate the final quarter.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>In post-match analysis, former Australia scrum-half George Gregan adds more praise: \u201cA tight-head prop scoring his first Test try in a World Cup, he\u2019ll be pretty happy with that, won\u2019t he?

      "bodyText": "No typhoons this week, just a gathering English storm. Whether it will be enough to propel Eddie Jones\u2019s side all the way to World Cup glory remains to be seen but Australia could not withstand their second-half surge in this eventful quarter-final. For the first time since 2007 England are into the last four and Saturday\u2019s smackdown with New Zealand will be some collision. If the final margin was slightly harsh on a spirited Wallaby side it was hard-earned reward for England\u2019s well-organised defence and the last-quarter power lurking on their bench. It took until the final quarter to establish clear forward-control but a rampaging 46th-minute score by tight-head Kyle Sinckler had already pushed Australia towards their earliest World Cup exit for a dozen years. If you had offered Eddie Jones a 24-point margin of victory against his homeland prior to the start he would have snatched your arm off above the elbow. The fact it was achieved with 36% of the ball and similar territory stats underlines the reality of modern-day rugby: possession is all very well but taking your chances when they arise is what really counts. In that regard Australia\u2019s 18 turnovers were a costly case of self-harm. So, too, were the two interception tries that ultimately wrecked any chance of Michael Cheika\u2019s side ending their recent grim sequence against the Poms. This was Jones\u2019s seventh successive win over his old Randwick teammate and, with the Cheika era drawing to a close, there can be no disputing the runaway winner of their personal duel. It was certainly a painful way for two great Wallaby servants, David Pocock and Will Genia, to go out. They can still bask in Australia\u2019s 33-13 victory over their old rivals at the 2015 World Cup but that golden glow is now a fading memory. Only one of these two teams currently appears to be on an upward curve. Jones could still do with Jonny May, the scorer of the first two of England\u2019s four tries, recovering swiftly from an apparent hamstring tweak but in Sinckler and his young flankers, Tom Curry and Sam Underhill, the coach has some steadily improving individuals. Anthony Watson\u2019s late interception and Owen Farrell\u2019s 100% kicking contribution also helped scupper the Wallabies, despite the promise of their exciting new centre Jordan Petaia and the roadrunner pace of winger Marika Koroibete. A one-sided outcome, however, did not always look an inevitability. Australia had looked the brighter side initially, probing for gaps in England\u2019s defensive spacing and taking an early lead via Christian Lealiifano\u2019s first successful penalty. Their opponents took a while to make any kind of consistent front-foot impression before May\u2019s double whammy inside four minutes banished their jangling nerves. The first was the product of a destructive hard line down the middle by Manu Tuilagi, which sucked in the Australian defence and stretched the cover further out, allowing Farrell and Curry to put May over in the left corner. The Wallabies needed to strike back immediately but, instead, Pocock\u2019s attempted pass to Lealiifano was intercepted by Henry Slade whose chip ahead with his supposedly weaker right foot gave May another chance to show his searing pace. Farrell\u2019s second touchline conversion deepened the pain and left Australia to play catch-up rugby, precisely the scenario they had been anxious to avoid. To their credit Cheika\u2019s side did not panic, attacking with verve and using purposeful pick-and-go tactics to try and fluster England. In terms of the scoreboard it yielded only a couple more penalties for Lealiifano to one from Farrell but at no stage could England entirely relax. Barely two minutes after the interval the margin was reduced to just a single point after Elliot Daly, under a bit of pressure, knocked on 40 metres from his own line and gave the Wallabies a broken field to play with. Slick use of the resulting turnover ball gave Koroibete the space to burn off Daly, only the third try England have so far conceded in this tournament. Australia\u2019s second-half record against England, however, has been dreadful lately and the same achilles heel duly presented itself. The Wallaby defence was too easily spilt by Farrell\u2019s snappy midfield miss-pass, allowing a beaming Sinckler to storm untouched through the unguarded heart of the defence. The Harlequins front-rower used to be a fly-half in his youth but this was the stuff of any prop forward\u2019s dreams. Sinckler was also responsible for a crucial defensive rip as Australia pressed for another score before Watson\u2019s final intervention and Farrell\u2019s fourth conversion took England into 40-point territory. There have been more conveniently situated stadiums in World Cup history \u2013 exactly how and why two of rugby\u2019s showpiece games ended up in this relatively obscure Japanese city remains a good question \u2013 but England will for ever remember their visit to this striking dome. Jones, his selection reshuffle fully vindicated, also reckons Japan\u2019s illustrious old warriors would approve of how his team are playing. \u201cThe best samurais were always the guys who had a plan they could adapt. They had calm heads but were full of aggression. I thought we were like that today but there\u2019s always a better samurai around the corner.\u201d Dressed all in black, in this case, and capable of asking more serious questions than England ultimately had to face here.",

      "body": "<p>Non-fiction is still king in the rapidly expanding podcast universe: the bulk of on-demand audio remains dedicated to interviews, debates about sport or pop culture, and the genre that pushed podcasting into the mainstream, true crime. But some of those formats have gone stale: if we have maybe had enough of 12-part documentaries about a multiple child murder in Delaware in 1995, we can certainly do without any more two-hour chinwags where famous-ish people chat to their friends. Be thankful, then, that podcasting has a new big thing: dramatic fiction. Serialised audio drama is emerging as a defined genre, nourished by a symbiotic relationship with the golden age of TV. It\u2019s still early, but the possibilities look infinite.</p> <p>This month saw Facebook Watch debut a TV thriller called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/oct/16/limetown-review-a-sub-x-files-podcast-to-tv-load-of-total-tosh-thanks-facebook\">Limetown</a>, starring Jessica Biel and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jan/23/stanley-tucci-interview\">Stanley Tucci</a>, about a public-radio reporter looking into the disappearance of 326 people at a Tennessee research facility. It is a remake of a 2015 podcast that started the audio drama surge by capitalising on the success of true-crime megahit Serial. Limetown used the same storytelling techniques to map out a work of fiction.</p> <p>Last year, Amazon Prime Video distributed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/nov/02/homecoming-review-julia-roberts-old-fashioned-mystery-has-hints-of-hitchcock\">Homecoming</a>, a tantalising double-timeline conspiracy drama starring Julia Roberts, no less, alongside Bobby Cannavale. It too was a TV retread of a hit podcast that had made waves two years earlier. Both Homecoming and Limetown fed the ravenous monster that is multi-platform peak TV with fresh ideas, shot through with a jittery nerdiness. Designed for lone listeners with headphones on, they translate well to the modern small-screen box set, a medium willing to take stylistic risks. Next to move to telly is The Horror of Dolores Roach, a Sweeney Todd-esque parable about a released convict who responds murderously to the gentrification of her old NYC neighbourhood, featuring \u2013 in the audio original, which returns for season two this month \u2013 Daphne Rubin-Vega and Cannavale (again).</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W15LeSQKewM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/W15LeSQKewM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Podcast dramas do not, however, require television\u2019s blessing to snag A-listers. The original Homecoming, for instance, was scarcely less starry than the Amazon version: David Schwimmer, Catherine Keener and Oscar Isaac were in it. Sandra, a kooky drama about a woman who goes to work for a company making an Alexa-like virtual assistant \u2013 the twist being that the device\u2019s responses are improvised by a vast team of human operators \u2013 managed to hire Alia Shawkat to play the new employee and Kristen Wiig as the digital voice of Sandra, with Christopher Abbott and Ethan Hawke in supporting roles. It has got major performers in it already and is a thoughtful, spiky thing with its own singular style, ideally suited to smartphone consumption; even audiobooks, booming as they are, can\u2019t compete with the bitesized episodes of a good drama when it comes to offering a hit of story that fits within a single commute.</p> <p>Podcasts also regularly now give established actors the chance to try stuff out: take 36 Questions, for instance, a musical led by Tony nominee and Mindhunter star Jonathan Groff that takes advantage of the intimacy of the medium; or Blackout, an apocalyptic thriller centring on a small-town DJ played by Rami Malek. The likes of Groff and Malek are utilising a facility that\u2019s always been open to British actors, thanks to BBC Radio 3 and 4 maintaining the radio drama tradition that the US lost in the 1950s. Audio projects tend to be challenging and creatively nourishing but require a fraction of the time commitment demanded by TV or film.</p> <p>Other big US podcasts are acutely aware that they\u2019re reviving a genre that, in the US, was considered long dead. Welcome to Night Vale, a series of local radio broadcasts addressing the residents of a town riven by bizarre phenomena, has the retro shimmer of Orson Welles\u2019s War of the Worlds. Its success fuelled the creation of production house Night Vale Presents, which has since released monologue-based mystery drama Alice Isn\u2019t Dead, spooky found-audio saga Within the Wires and \u201cAfrofuturistic buddy comedy\u201d Adventures in New America, among others.</p> <p>One indication that drama podcasting is still nascent is that the big shows are the work of a handful of people. Writer-producer Terry Miles followed up paranormal pseudo-doc The Black Tapes (co-created by Paul Bae) with the spin-off series Tanis and the stylistically similar Rabbits, while Limetown and 36 Questions are both from the same company, Two-Up. Sandra, The Horror of Dolores Roach and Homecoming, meanwhile, are on the roster of Gimlet Media, perhaps podcasting\u2019s strongest player.

      "bodyText": "Non-fiction is still king in the rapidly expanding podcast universe: the bulk of on-demand audio remains dedicated to interviews, debates about sport or pop culture, and the genre that pushed podcasting into the mainstream, true crime. But some of those formats have gone stale: if we have maybe had enough of 12-part documentaries about a multiple child murder in Delaware in 1995, we can certainly do without any more two-hour chinwags where famous-ish people chat to their friends. Be thankful, then, that podcasting has a new big thing: dramatic fiction. Serialised audio drama is emerging as a defined genre, nourished by a symbiotic relationship with the golden age of TV. It\u2019s still early, but the possibilities look infinite. This month saw Facebook Watch debut a TV thriller called Limetown, starring Jessica Biel and Stanley Tucci, about a public-radio reporter looking into the disappearance of 326 people at a Tennessee research facility. It is a remake of a 2015 podcast that started the audio drama surge by capitalising on the success of true-crime megahit Serial. Limetown used the same storytelling techniques to map out a work of fiction. Last year, Amazon Prime Video distributed Homecoming, a tantalising double-timeline conspiracy drama starring Julia Roberts, no less, alongside Bobby Cannavale. It too was a TV retread of a hit podcast that had made waves two years earlier. Both Homecoming and Limetown fed the ravenous monster that is multi-platform peak TV with fresh ideas, shot through with a jittery nerdiness. Designed for lone listeners with headphones on, they translate well to the modern small-screen box set, a medium willing to take stylistic risks. Next to move to telly is The Horror of Dolores Roach, a Sweeney Todd-esque parable about a released convict who responds murderously to the gentrification of her old NYC neighbourhood, featuring \u2013 in the audio original, which returns for season two this month \u2013 Daphne Rubin-Vega and Cannavale (again). Podcast dramas do not, however, require television\u2019s blessing to snag A-listers. The original Homecoming, for instance, was scarcely less starry than the Amazon version: David Schwimmer, Catherine Keener and Oscar Isaac were in it. Sandra, a kooky drama about a woman who goes to work for a company making an Alexa-like virtual assistant \u2013 the twist being that the device\u2019s responses are improvised by a vast team of human operators \u2013 managed to hire Alia Shawkat to play the new employee and Kristen Wiig as the digital voice of Sandra, with Christopher Abbott and Ethan Hawke in supporting roles. It has got major performers in it already and is a thoughtful, spiky thing with its own singular style, ideally suited to smartphone consumption; even audiobooks, booming as they are, can\u2019t compete with the bitesized episodes of a good drama when it comes to offering a hit of story that fits within a single commute. Podcasts also regularly now give established actors the chance to try stuff out: take 36 Questions, for instance, a musical led by Tony nominee and Mindhunter star Jonathan Groff that takes advantage of the intimacy of the medium; or Blackout, an apocalyptic thriller centring on a small-town DJ played by Rami Malek. The likes of Groff and Malek are utilising a facility that\u2019s always been open to British actors, thanks to BBC Radio 3 and 4 maintaining the radio drama tradition that the US lost in the 1950s. Audio projects tend to be challenging and creatively nourishing but require a fraction of the time commitment demanded by TV or film. Other big US podcasts are acutely aware that they\u2019re reviving a genre that, in the US, was considered long dead. Welcome to Night Vale, a series of local radio broadcasts addressing the residents of a town riven by bizarre phenomena, has the retro shimmer of Orson Welles\u2019s War of the Worlds. Its success fuelled the creation of production house Night Vale Presents, which has since released monologue-based mystery drama Alice Isn\u2019t Dead, spooky found-audio saga Within the Wires and \u201cAfrofuturistic buddy comedy\u201d Adventures in New America, among others. One indication that drama podcasting is still nascent is that the big shows are the work of a handful of people. Writer-producer Terry Miles followed up paranormal pseudo-doc The Black Tapes (co-created by Paul Bae) with the spin-off series Tanis and the stylistically similar Rabbits, while Limetown and 36 Questions are both from the same company, Two-Up. Sandra, The Horror of Dolores Roach and Homecoming, meanwhile, are on the roster of Gimlet Media, perhaps podcasting\u2019s strongest player. Its upcoming releases include a second season of fantasy saga The Two Princes, and new cyber-revenge conspiracy/romance drama Motherhacker, starring Carrie Coon and Alan Cumming. Gimlet gained new clout when it was acquired in February by Spotify for $230m \u2013 so we can hope for a lot more imaginative fiction, and a little less of George Ezra interviewing Ed Sheeran.

      "body": "<h2>Grandmaster Flash, 61, hip-hop pioneer, and AJ Tracey, 25, MC</h2> <p>Grandmaster Flash \u2013 born Joseph Saddler on New Year\u2019s Day, 1958 \u2013 is often credited as one of the pioneers of hip-hop, but his achievements are as much in the field of engineering as they are in music. It was Flash who invented the slipmat that allowed records to be manipulated by DJs; who used solder and Super Glue to give decks a separate headphone channel, so they could hear the record they were cueing up; and who invented the \u201cquick-mix theory\u201d, allowing small portions of tracks to be looped. Those innovations formed the basis of modern DJing.</p> <p>Hip-hop has gone through many iterations since Flash debuted his skills on the wheels of steel (a phrase he popularised) at block parties in the Bronx. AJ Tracey, the London MC, tries to embody them all, combining grime, UK drill and trap in his music. An outspoken supporter of Jeremy Corbyn, he is one of the leading lights of the UK rap scene, registering a No 3 album and selling out two nights at London\u2019s Alexandra Palace. The pair immediately hit it off and talk constantly during the photoshoot \u2013 about love, their roots and Nando\u2019s, sometimes to the dismay of the Guardian\u2019s photographer. \u201cHow can you photograph us having a talk if we\u2019re not talking!\u201d shouts Flash.</p> <p><strong>Grandmaster Flash</strong> So what would you do if it wasn\u2019t music?</p> <p><strong>AJ Tracey</strong> I don\u2019t want to say something incriminating! I was at university, so, hopefully, I would have got a job. I was doing criminology.</p> <p><strong>GF</strong> Criminology? So which side of the coin were you working?</p> <p><strong>AJT</strong> Ha, both sides. Studying their side, but doing my side. I love learning about history. I thought criminology would give me a bit of an insight into how cities work.</p> <p><strong>GF</strong> Did your parents want you to stay at college?</p> <p><strong>AJT</strong> My dad was born in the UK, but he actually got sent back to Trinidad for a while for misbehaving. He was impoverished and obviously black people had it hard it in the UK. He was a rapper, too, but my grandma told him, \u201cI want you to go to school and bring some money to the family because you should be grateful for the British education.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My mother was a pirate radio DJ. Being a white Welsh woman spinning hip-hop was unheard of</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>So when it was my turn, he said I should go to college. Any parent who cares about his son would say that, especially any parent from Trinidad. And when I told my gran that I wanted to do the music thing and leave uni, she rolled up her sleeves, got the spoon and just whacked it.</p> <p><strong>GF</strong> I used to get my ass whacked, too! My father was an avid collector of vinyl records. The rules of the household were: never to go in the closet where dad\u2019s records were, and never to touch the stereo. But as soon as I heard his tools go over his shoulder, and the door slam, I would grab a chair, play music and dance around the living room. Whoever was home would say, \u201cDad will take your head off if he sees this\u201d, and he would kick my ass, but in a way that made me know the records were really valuable, so I\u2019d do it again.</p> <p>After a while, I had to start diagnosing the vinyl. My mother was a seamstress, so I took one of her needles and put the tip inside the black tunnel and felt a vibration. I\u2019m like, \u201cHoly moly \u2013 the music lives in the black tunnels!\u201d Then it was on: me going in the closet, him beating my ass, me going in the closet. My dad was the brother of the 1948 featherweight champion of the world, so he had hands of stone.</p> <p><strong>AJT</strong> I can identify with that. My mother was a pirate radio DJ. Being a white Welsh woman spinning hip-hop was unheard of \u2013 my dad obviously fell in love with that. She used to spin <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/nwa\" title=\"\">NWA</a>. She\u2019s got NWA\u2019s first vinyl, and she has two copies: one to spin and one that\u2019s sealed. She knew it was going to be crazy valuable. That\u2019s the record I wasn\u2019t allowed to touch. But actually my mum was the one saying: \u201cGo for it, do music.\u201d</p> <p><strong>GF</strong> Oooh, that\u2019s interesting. It was mom saying go for it.</p> <p><strong>AJT</strong> What would you have done if not music?</p> <p><strong>GF</strong> I think I would have been an electronic technician, because I was always unscrewing the back of amps and seeing how the circuitry worked. That\u2019s what my people wanted me to be. I actually had to stop hanging around people \u2013</p> <p><strong>AJT</strong> \u2013 who were telling you that it\u2019s not going to work out [in music]?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"e3a0b49c50cbe5e6f97db5105ea5fe54f3f2cf62\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e3a0b49c50cbe5e6f97db5105ea5fe54f3f2cf62/100_218_2069_3587/577.jpg\" alt=\"Grandmaster Flash\" width=\"577\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>GF</strong> Exactly. In my teenage years, when I was trying to figure out the quick-mix theory, I had a crew. They would knock on the door and say, \u201cCan Joe come out and play?\u201d I\u2019d say, \u201cI\u2019ll be right there.\u201d After months and months, they realised I was never coming out. So all my friends left and my audience was my miniature doberman pinscher named Caesar.</p> <p>Later, when we would play in the neighbourhood parks, my problem was there was no place to plug in, because if you asked a person in the nearest apartment, that\u2019s a lot of juice! By this time I had knowledge of electronics, so I worked out that the lamp-post turns on at dusk automatically. I had to break the lamp-post door, find the electronic timer, cut the head of the extension cord and wire it so the electricity was going all the time. These were the challenges.</p> <p><strong>AJT</strong> I wouldn\u2019t go to the park, but I would go to pirate radio stations to try and get the microphone. You almost have to fight your way in there. It\u2019s really a hood thing \u2013 you need to be built tough, because you need to go in there with your people and say: \u201cIt\u2019s my turn.\u201d Often it was 2am in Enfield \u2013 not many listeners could hear me, but I could hear me.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The big-time drug dealers would come to the park with us and buy 300 bottles of pop and bags of crisps for the audience</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>GF</strong> Exactly! It\u2019s about that practice. For us it wasn\u2019t pirate radio, but we did deal with the cops. Early on, they would shut us down. But what would happen is that all the big-time drug dealers and hood rats and killers would come into the park and jam with us \u2013 what we were doing just brought the best out of people. Drug dealers were going to the shop and buying 300 bottles of pop and 300 bags of crisps for the audience. And the cops would just sit around and be happy they had nothing to do.</p> <p><strong>AJT</strong> Man, I can\u2019t imagine British police saying it\u2019s a good thing, but one day they will. UK rap is a baby compared with the US \u2013 we\u2019re still new to this. We need some more time for everyone to become accustomed to black culture.</p> <p><strong>GF</strong> Are you a perfectionist?</p> <p><strong>AJT</strong> Absolutely. I\u2019m my worst critic.</p> <p><strong>GF</strong> Me, too. I\u2019ll come off stage and people will be cheering \u201cone more tune\u201d, and all I\u2019ll be able to think about is 15 minutes into the set I fucked up a mix.</p> <p><strong>AJT</strong> Me too, bro. My tour manager will say it was a great show, but I won\u2019t be happy, because I know I fumbled. They\u2019ll say no one noticed. But I notice.</p> <p><strong>GF</strong> So what\u2019s the biggest difference for us? The internet.</p> <p><strong>AJT</strong> That would be the defining thing. You were in the Bronx, and I was growing up in west London \u2013 but with the internet we\u2019re half a second away from everyone. I was recording music in a trap house, pressing a button and uploading it to SoundCloud \u2013 which means it\u2019s in people\u2019s bedrooms, in white households in America, in Japan. It\u2019s much easier for me to sneak around the powers that be, and the gatekeepers, and get my sound out there. I still wanna rap about things that are close to home. You can\u2019t tell me I should speak on Trump or Brexit, just because it\u2019s two big things that are happening. That\u2019s not how it works. I will speak on Grenfell or the Labour party \u2013 things that are close to home.</p> <p><strong>GF</strong> Right. It\u2019s got to be something that affects the artist, their family or their neighbourhood.</p> <p><strong>AJT</strong> I wouldn\u2019t say we had the same struggles, but they\u2019re similar struggles. Our parents, being black and from black heritage, the struggles of being a perfectionist. I feel like that\u2019s within every artist \u2013 the struggle that led you to excel, and that in turn leads you to want to give perfection.</p> <h2>Janet Ellis, 64, writer, actor and television presenter, and Will Lenney, 23, YouTube superstar</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c407bcfc7a8e0a2a185fd2fc2ba3b383f0ec647f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c407bcfc7a8e0a2a185fd2fc2ba3b383f0ec647f/379_1264_4089_5110/800.jpg\" alt=\"Will Lenney and Janet Ellis.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lenney and Ellis: \u2018I think it\u2019s important for the ideas to come from you.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: P\u00e5l Hansen/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1983, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/janet-ellis\" title=\"\">Janet Ellis</a> was looking for a new challenge.

The channel began as a bedroom exploit in Whitley Bay in North Tyneside, but has now made Lenney rich enough to move to a flash London apartment, where his videos are recorded.</p> <p>Today, Ellis and Lenney\u2019s 41-year age gap feels immaterial; they josh and banter as if they have just been announced as two brand new Blue Peter presenters, assuming boy-band poses and swapping stories of their most disastrous links (Lenney just rerecorded his, whereas Ellis\u2019s went out on TV to millions).</p> <p><strong>Janet Ellis</strong> This is a question you must be endlessly asked: how do you become a YouTuber?</p> <p><strong>Will </strong><strong>Lenney</strong> There\u2019s no \u201cfollow this first step\u201d, no path. You give it your all and hope for the best. I think that\u2019s probably one of the biggest similarities between our careers.</p> <p><strong>JE</strong> Yeah, I had no career plan. When I was little, I wanted to act, but when you go, \u201cI want to be an actress\u201d, people just go, \u201cWell, did you know, 75% of the people in the profession are out of work?\u201d And I have to say, I just went: \u201cWell, poor them.\u201d</p> <p><strong>WL</strong> Sod yous, yeah? I like that. The one thing I\u2019d say is that if you start out wanting to do YouTube as a job, you\u2019re finished from the get-go.</p> <p><strong>JE</strong> I get that. When people say, \u201cI want to be a presenter\u201d, I think: what do you want to talk about on camera? Why do you want to be there?</p> <p><strong>WL</strong> For me, it started as a hobby \u2013 just making daft comedy videos maybe once or twice a year. I failed my A-levels spectacularly and had to retake them, but I used all the spare time I had to give the YouTube thing a really good go.</p> <p><strong>JE</strong> I got my provisional Equity card early and did loads of theatre, and then four episodes of Doctor Who. Along the way, I had Sophie and then went straight back to work. I did a kids\u2019 series called Jigsaw just weeks after she was born.</p> <p><strong>WL</strong> That must have been hard.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I've always had an office of people whose job it was to find something to do. On Blue Peter, 75% was viewer-suggested</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>JE</strong> I didn\u2019t know any different. I had her when I was 23, so the same age as you. I felt clever, you know: \u201cI can do all this <em>and</em> I\u2019ve got a kid.\u201d Also, in real life, if somebody says: \u201cRight, you\u2019re going to get up at six in the morning and go parachuting\u201d, I\u2019d say no. But presenter-me says, \u201cOh yes!\u201d I suppose what makes a good presenter is allowing people to see that actually, you <em>would</em> rather be in bed, or that you\u2019re scared.</p> <p><strong>WL</strong> Totally \u2013 especially on YouTube, when people will go, \u201cI got up, I ate breakfast, you know, I went to John Lewis.\u201d If you bring people into that, they feel like they know you as a mate.</p> <p><strong>JE</strong> I wanted to ask you about ideas, because the stuff I\u2019ve done, there\u2019s been an office full of people whose job it was to find something to do. On Blue Peter, 75% of it was viewer-suggested. Do you have people who suggest content?</p> <p><strong>WL</strong> I think it\u2019s important for the ideas to come from you, because it\u2019s your channel. But we get immediate feedback with analytics. You can see the number of people watching your channel over the last 60 minutes, then for each minute, how many times someone clicked on each video. When shows like Love Island are on, there\u2019s no point in uploading, because I can see the huge drop-off. No one is on YouTube at that time.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I would never put something in my videos that I wouldn\u2019t say to my mum</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>JE</strong> Yeah, we owned them: the audience had nowhere else to go. Not just the kids, but the parents, because everyone understands the words Blue Peter. It\u2019s been on now for 60 years. Even by the time I joined, it was 25 years old, and if parents went into the room and their kids were watching they would probably stay, for reasons of nostalgia. I have grandsons now, and they\u2019re all fully YouTube conversant, but it\u2019s not that thing of getting home from school and it\u2019s there, and mum might come in and watch, too.</p> <p>Do you like the fact that it enables young people to have this thing that has nothing to do with us?</p> <p><strong>WL</strong> Parents should always be aware of what someone is watching but yes, we specifically target who we think is our demographic. Having said that, I would never put something in my videos that I wouldn\u2019t say to my mum.</p> <p><strong>JE</strong> That is an excellent rule.</p> <p><strong>WL</strong> That usually helps me walk the line pretty well. I find it liberating. I quite enjoy the responsibility, or burden, of knowing the buck stops with me. </p> <p><strong>JE</strong> I left the BBC years ago, but you become a spokesperson for it. I have lost count of the number of times I\u2019ve been asked to defend children\u2019s television, and you will be asked to defend YouTube.</p> <p><strong>WL</strong> Yeah, I get that quite a lot. YouTube is very strictly regulated now, whereas maybe it wasn\u2019t seven or eight years ago. There are dos and don\u2019ts. Now, if you say certain jokes, YouTube are not going to put any adverts on your video. I just have to make the decision: is this worth the risk?</p> <p><strong>JE</strong> With live telly, people always assume that you\u2019re desperate to swear or do something wrong. But I wouldn\u2019t ever do that. I joined Blue Peter when I was 28, so I wasn\u2019t going to be living a nun-like existence, but the first responsibility was always \u2013 it sounds so prissy \u2013 to the viewer. I don\u2019t want to be the person they see falling over pissed and being horrible to waiters, or something. But this was way before Twitter, paparazzi; I suppose it\u2019s harder now.</p> <p><strong>WL</strong> It can be very volatile. There was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/mar/25/google-youtube-advertising-extremist-content-att-verizon\" title=\"\">a big YouTube scandal in 2017</a> when a lot of advertisers pulled out over concerns about what their adverts appeared on. It had just become my full-time job. I\u2019d moved down to London, I was paying rent, and suddenly you go from getting paid, say, a pound for 1,000 views to 10 pence.</p> <p><strong>JE</strong> When the News Of The World published an expos\u00e9 of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/aug/29/richard-bacon-q-and-a\" title=\"\">Richard Bacon</a>, 22, taking cocaine, it was horrible. He\u2019s still one of the best presenters they ever had, and he was immediately sacked and the then head of children\u2019s programmes, Lorraine Heggessey, sat in front of a bowl of daffodils and did this sort of Queen-like speech before the programme went on air, you know: \u201cvery disappointed in the behaviour\u201d. They dragged some of us out of retirement because they were suddenly one presenter down. So I went and did a few programmes. But it was ridiculous.</p> <p><strong>WL</strong> That\u2019s a horrible existence that, innit? On the other hand I\u2019ve been doing these live shows and it\u2019s been such a lovely experience and privilege just to speak to people on the street who enjoy what you do.</p> <p><strong>JE</strong> YouTube makes people scared, so you have to hold their hands and tell them it\u2019s fine. My 10-year-old grandson has started talking into the camera completely unaffectedly, wandering around the house \u2013 using entirely the wrong angle.</p> <p><strong>WL</strong> You\u2019ve got to start somewhere.</p> <p><strong>JE</strong> Well, he always starts with: \u201cHey, guys.\u201d</p> <p><strong>WL</strong> That\u2019s so sweet. Ten is young for it, but by the time he\u2019s 15, he could get bloody good. I haven\u2019t even been doing it for five years. I hope he keeps doing it.</p> <h2>Alice Oswald, 53, Oxford professor of poetry, and Yrsa Daley-Ward, 30, Instagram poet</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"efc13f0f11274680b36cb59ccf8b358cd52324a3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/efc13f0f11274680b36cb59ccf8b358cd52324a3/17_11_2532_1519/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Yrsa Daley-Ward and Alice Oswald.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Daley-Ward and Oswald: \u2018Now I am happy to sit or walk, waiting for a poem.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: P\u00e5l Hansen, Gareth Iwan Jones/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/alice-oswald\" title=\"\">Alice Oswald</a> was elected Oxford professor of poetry in June this year, succeeding <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/simonarmitage\" title=\"\">Simon Armitage</a> and becoming the first woman in the role. It follows a string of prestigious poetry prizes, and acclaim from her contemporaries: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/carol-ann-duffy\" title=\"\">Carol Ann Duffy</a> hailed her \u201cthe best UK poet now writing, bar none\u201d, while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/jeanettewinterson\" title=\"\">Jeanette Winterson</a> said she was \u201cmaking a new kind of poetry\u201d, bringing the countryside, myth and nature to life.</p> <p>Oswald\u2019s career has centred on traditional published collections and literary magazines; by contrast, Yrsa Daley-Ward self-published her debut collection, Bone, in 2014, but rose to prominence after publishing excerpts and new poems on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/yrsadaleyward/?hl=en\" title=\"\">Instagram</a> (she has amassed more than 150,000 followers). These were initially interspersed with photos from her modelling career and videos of live performances. She bristles at the label \u201cInstagram poet\u201d, but the way she posts poetry, sometimes as a screengrab of her Apple Notes app, or scribbled down in a notebook, feels especially urgent. Modelling has mostly been replaced by acting, and she\u2019s currently appearing as Connie in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/sep/29/world-on-fire-review-ordinary-lives-caught-up-in-extraordinary-times\" title=\"\">World On Fire</a>, Peter Bowker\u2019s new BBC drama about the second world war.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>On social media, we can\u2019t hide from the fact that a lot of things are very self-centred</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Daley-Ward, who was born in Chorley, Lancashire, and raised in part by strict Seventh-day Adventist grandparents, now lives in New York, from where she spoke on the phone to Alice, who was in her cottage in south Devon.</p> <p><strong>Alice Oswald</strong> I think it\u2019s fascinating that poetry has found its way on to Instagram. I wonder whether it might then grow into a form where it\u2019s not so autobiographical, and maybe the images are not personal \u2013 that it might create a form that\u2019s more like Chinese poetry, which tends to be both visual and verbal at the same time.</p> <p><strong>Yrsa Daley-Ward</strong> You know, on social media, we can\u2019t hide from the fact that a lot of things are very self-centred. They just are. And if we think about things generationally, as well, people [of my generation] are almost obsessed with our journey, our feelings about this, our trauma. I don\u2019t think you have to be like that to do well on social media. I always hear this thing \u201cInstagram poet\u201d, but often people are using excerpts from much longer works.</p> <p>Do you ever split poems up in that way? Do you see four or five lines from the larger body of work as standing alone, and maybe even meaning something else?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It seemed to put people off when poetry was taught in schools. It\u2019s exciting that social media poetry has changed that</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>AO</strong> Yes. I like the notion that the poem is a very intense, airborne thing. One only captures a little bit of the poem you get in a book \u2013 just a trace of some actual alive poem that\u2019s always elsewhere.</p> <p>It does feel as if people are talking more about poetry now, and I\u2019m delighted by that. I was always frustrated that it only ever seemed to put people off when it was taught in schools. It\u2019s exciting that, suddenly, performance poetry and social media poetry have changed that.</p> <p><strong>YD-W</strong> I think there\u2019s been a huge surge. People are going into prisons and care units and facilitating the writing of poetry. I\u2019m from a very religious background, so I grew up on biblical text. Also, I\u2019m Jamaican and Nigerian, so I grew up on knowledge of the ancestors or oral storytelling, fables. When that meets this modern way of processing, understanding and speaking about things in a very simple and succinct way, you almost, as the writer, don\u2019t have to make it happen. It\u2019s already there.</p> <p><strong>AO</strong> For me, poetry is all about expressing the fact that I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. Does that have any resonance with you?</p> <p><strong>YD-W</strong> I\u2019m interested in what I do know and what I don\u2019t know. I think I found poetry because I wanted to talk about things that were in front of me. But I don\u2019t always understand a feeling before it\u2019s on the page. So I think the genesis of it is still what I don\u2019t know. Then somewhere in that process, it becomes very personal.</p> <p><strong>AO</strong> When I was younger I used to suffer from that panic of, \u201cOh I\u2019m never going to write again, this has gone.\u201d Now I am happy to sit or walk, waiting for a poem. It\u2019s not really up to me \u2013 I just have to do the listening.</p> <p><strong>YD-W</strong> I know I want to be very serene, and not that intentional. Which is why I write in the morning because then everything still feels possible. I feel open and not too much has happened in the day to make me distracted.</p> <p><strong>AO</strong> I, too, love the early morning \u2013 to get up before anyone else is awake, drink strong coffee. That does offer a kind of clarity that isn\u2019t always there in the rest of the day. But I do notice that, however much I try to say to myself that it\u2019s a daily discipline, probably the more inventive poems emerge at times when things aren\u2019t manageable.</p> <p><strong>YD-W</strong> Yeah, I agree \u2013 I think because the mind has to go somewhere.</p> <p><strong>AO</strong> That\u2019s exactly it. If you reach impossibility, then that\u2019s when the imagination kicks in, I think.</p> <p><strong>YD-W</strong> There\u2019s a passion that comes during those times. Where you put your energies is particularly surprising and important. </p> <p><strong>AO</strong> Yes, I remember when I was 20 or so, and I decided to try writing so-called free verse. I remember feeling physical panic as I was doing it, which was exhilarating. But I think the things poetry summons up are quite terrifying.</p> <p><strong>YD-W</strong> Absolutely. But I think we can always rest in the knowledge that the work stands alone. When somebody is there with your book, you\u2019re not there in person. It\u2019s no longer about you.</p> <p><strong>AO</strong> There\u2019s a difference between Alice and Alice Oswald, and I spend most of my time trying to escape Alice Oswald. I hate her. If she is anywhere near me when I\u2019m trying to write, that\u2019s a disaster. So I have good ways of getting rid of her. I find her entirely fictional and redundant. I like the thing you say somewhere: \u201cYou know you\u2019re writing the truth when you\u2019re terrified.\u201d</p> <p><strong>YD-W</strong> I think that whenever you are nervous that you\u2019re revealing yourself, or that you\u2019re saying something you haven\u2019t said before \u2013 that\u2019s when you\u2019re striking something important.</p> <p>\u2022 If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email <a href=\"mailto:weekend@theguardian.com\" title=\"\">weekend@theguardian.com</a>, including your name and address (not for publication).</p>",

      "bodyText": "Grandmaster Flash, 61, hip-hop pioneer, and AJ Tracey, 25, MC Grandmaster Flash \u2013 born Joseph Saddler on New Year\u2019s Day, 1958 \u2013 is often credited as one of the pioneers of hip-hop, but his achievements are as much in the field of engineering as they are in music. It was Flash who invented the slipmat that allowed records to be manipulated by DJs; who used solder and Super Glue to give decks a separate headphone channel, so they could hear the record they were cueing up; and who invented the \u201cquick-mix theory\u201d, allowing small portions of tracks to be looped. Those innovations formed the basis of modern DJing. Hip-hop has gone through many iterations since Flash debuted his skills on the wheels of steel (a phrase he popularised) at block parties in the Bronx. AJ Tracey, the London MC, tries to embody them all, combining grime, UK drill and trap in his music. An outspoken supporter of Jeremy Corbyn, he is one of the leading lights of the UK rap scene, registering a No 3 album and selling out two nights at London\u2019s Alexandra Palace. The pair immediately hit it off and talk constantly during the photoshoot \u2013 about love, their roots and Nando\u2019s, sometimes to the dismay of the Guardian\u2019s photographer. \u201cHow can you photograph us having a talk if we\u2019re not talking!\u201d shouts Flash. Grandmaster Flash So what would you do if it wasn\u2019t music? AJ Tracey I don\u2019t want to say something incriminating! I was at university, so, hopefully, I would have got a job. I was doing criminology. GF Criminology? So which side of the coin were you working? AJT Ha, both sides. Studying their side, but doing my side. I love learning about history. I thought criminology would give me a bit of an insight into how cities work. GF Did your parents want you to stay at college? AJT My dad was born in the UK, but he actually got sent back to Trinidad for a while for misbehaving. He was impoverished and obviously black people had it hard it in the UK. He was a rapper, too, but my grandma told him, \u201cI want you to go to school and bring some money to the family because you should be grateful for the British education.\u201d So when it was my turn, he said I should go to college. Any parent who cares about his son would say that, especially any parent from Trinidad. And when I told my gran that I wanted to do the music thing and leave uni, she rolled up her sleeves, got the spoon and just whacked it. GF I used to get my ass whacked, too! My father was an avid collector of vinyl records. The rules of the household were: never to go in the closet where dad\u2019s records were, and never to touch the stereo. But as soon as I heard his tools go over his shoulder, and the door slam, I would grab a chair, play music and dance around the living room. Whoever was home would say, \u201cDad will take your head off if he sees this\u201d, and he would kick my ass, but in a way that made me know the records were really valuable, so I\u2019d do it again. After a while, I had to start diagnosing the vinyl. My mother was a seamstress, so I took one of her needles and put the tip inside the black tunnel and felt a vibration. I\u2019m like, \u201cHoly moly \u2013 the music lives in the black tunnels!\u201d Then it was on: me going in the closet, him beating my ass, me going in the closet. My dad was the brother of the 1948 featherweight champion of the world, so he had hands of stone. AJT I can identify with that. My mother was a pirate radio DJ. Being a white Welsh woman spinning hip-hop was unheard of \u2013 my dad obviously fell in love with that. She used to spin NWA. She\u2019s got NWA\u2019s first vinyl, and she has two copies: one to spin and one that\u2019s sealed. She knew it was going to be crazy valuable. That\u2019s the record I wasn\u2019t allowed to touch. But actually my mum was the one saying: \u201cGo for it, do music.\u201d GF Oooh, that\u2019s interesting. It was mom saying go for it. AJT What would you have done if not music? GF I think I would have been an electronic technician, because I was always unscrewing the back of amps and seeing how the circuitry worked. That\u2019s what my people wanted me to be. I actually had to stop hanging around people \u2013 AJT \u2013 who were telling you that it\u2019s not going to work out [in music]? GF Exactly. In my teenage years, when I was trying to figure out the quick-mix theory, I had a crew. They would knock on the door and say, \u201cCan Joe come out and play?\u201d I\u2019d say, \u201cI\u2019ll be right there.\u201d After months and months, they realised I was never coming out. So all my friends left and my audience was my miniature doberman pinscher named Caesar. Later, when we would play in the neighbourhood parks, my problem was there was no place to plug in, because if you asked a person in the nearest apartment, that\u2019s a lot of juice! By this time I had knowledge of electronics, so I worked out that the lamp-post turns on at dusk automatically. I had to break the lamp-post door, find the electronic timer, cut the head of the extension cord and wire it so the electricity was going all the time. These were the challenges. AJT I wouldn\u2019t go to the park, but I would go to pirate radio stations to try and get the microphone. You almost have to fight your way in there. It\u2019s really a hood thing \u2013 you need to be built tough, because you need to go in there with your people and say: \u201cIt\u2019s my turn.\u201d Often it was 2am in Enfield \u2013 not many listeners could hear me, but I could hear me. GF Exactly! It\u2019s about that practice. For us it wasn\u2019t pirate radio, but we did deal with the cops. Early on, they would shut us down. But what would happen is that all the big-time drug dealers and hood rats and killers would come into the park and jam with us \u2013 what we were doing just brought the best out of people. Drug dealers were going to the shop and buying 300 bottles of pop and 300 bags of crisps for the audience. And the cops would just sit around and be happy they had nothing to do. AJT Man, I can\u2019t imagine British police saying it\u2019s a good thing, but one day they will. UK rap is a baby compared with the US \u2013 we\u2019re still new to this. We need some more time for everyone to become accustomed to black culture. GF Are you a perfectionist? AJT Absolutely. I\u2019m my worst critic. GF Me, too. I\u2019ll come off stage and people will be cheering \u201cone more tune\u201d, and all I\u2019ll be able to think about is 15 minutes into the set I fucked up a mix. AJT Me too, bro. My tour manager will say it was a great show, but I won\u2019t be happy, because I know I fumbled. They\u2019ll say no one noticed. But I notice. GF So what\u2019s the biggest difference for us? The internet. AJT That would be the defining thing. You were in the Bronx, and I was growing up in west London \u2013 but with the internet we\u2019re half a second away from everyone. I was recording music in a trap house, pressing a button and uploading it to SoundCloud \u2013 which means it\u2019s in people\u2019s bedrooms, in white households in America, in Japan. It\u2019s much easier for me to sneak around the powers that be, and the gatekeepers, and get my sound out there. I still wanna rap about things that are close to home. You can\u2019t tell me I should speak on Trump or Brexit, just because it\u2019s two big things that are happening. That\u2019s not how it works. I will speak on Grenfell or the Labour party \u2013 things that are close to home. GF Right. It\u2019s got to be something that affects the artist, their family or their neighbourhood. AJT I wouldn\u2019t say we had the same struggles, but they\u2019re similar struggles. Our parents, being black and from black heritage, the struggles of being a perfectionist. I feel like that\u2019s within every artist \u2013 the struggle that led you to excel, and that in turn leads you to want to give perfection. Janet Ellis, 64, writer, actor and television presenter, and Will Lenney, 23, YouTube superstar In 1983, Janet Ellis was looking for a new challenge. Having previously only accepted acting roles, she initially felt offended when it was suggested she audition to be the new Blue Peter presenter; she was only persuaded after betting her agent \u00a35 she wouldn\u2019t get the gig. She lost the bet, and became one of the show\u2019s best-loved hosts. Her four-year stint was followed by regular BBC presenting jobs and occasional TV appearances with her daughter, the singer Sophie Ellis-Bextor. Her main focus is now fiction; her second novel, How It Was, was published in August. Children\u2019s television has changed a lot since Ellis\u2019s day, not least in that little of it is watched on television. Half of children over eight say they prefer YouTube, and the majority of 12- to 15-year-olds say they regularly watch content made by vloggers. Will Lenney, better known as WillNE, is a 23-year-old YouTube superstar with more than 3 million subscribers. His posts are mostly first-person looks at internet culture: These Life Hacks Are Beyond Useless or Remaking The Worst Tik Toks I Could Find, for instance. He\u2019s often joined by other popular YouTube personalities, although Lenney brings a sense of humour and self-deprecation to his vlogs. The channel began as a bedroom exploit in Whitley Bay in North Tyneside, but has now made Lenney rich enough to move to a flash London apartment, where his videos are recorded. Today, Ellis and Lenney\u2019s 41-year age gap feels immaterial; they josh and banter as if they have just been announced as two brand new Blue Peter presenters, assuming boy-band poses and swapping stories of their most disastrous links (Lenney just rerecorded his, whereas Ellis\u2019s went out on TV to millions). Janet Ellis This is a question you must be endlessly asked: how do you become a YouTuber? Will Lenney There\u2019s no \u201cfollow this first step\u201d, no path. You give it your all and hope for the best. I think that\u2019s probably one of the biggest similarities between our careers. JE Yeah, I had no career plan. When I was little, I wanted to act, but when you go, \u201cI want to be an actress\u201d, people just go, \u201cWell, did you know, 75% of the people in the profession are out of work?\u201d And I have to say, I just went: \u201cWell, poor them.\u201d WL Sod yous, yeah? I like that. The one thing I\u2019d say is that if you start out wanting to do YouTube as a job, you\u2019re finished from the get-go. JE I get that. When people say, \u201cI want to be a presenter\u201d, I think: what do you want to talk about on camera? Why do you want to be there? WL For me, it started as a hobby \u2013 just making daft comedy videos maybe once or twice a year. I failed my A-levels spectacularly and had to retake them, but I used all the spare time I had to give the YouTube thing a really good go. JE I got my provisional Equity card early and did loads of theatre, and then four episodes of Doctor Who. Along the way, I had Sophie and then went straight back to work. I did a kids\u2019 series called Jigsaw just weeks after she was born. WL That must have been hard. JE I didn\u2019t know any different. I had her when I was 23, so the same age as you. I felt clever, you know: \u201cI can do all this and I\u2019ve got a kid.\u201d Also, in real life, if somebody says: \u201cRight, you\u2019re going to get up at six in the morning and go parachuting\u201d, I\u2019d say no. But presenter-me says, \u201cOh yes!\u201d I suppose what makes a good presenter is allowing people to see that actually, you would rather be in bed, or that you\u2019re scared. WL Totally \u2013 especially on YouTube, when people will go, \u201cI got up, I ate breakfast, you know, I went to John Lewis.\u201d If you bring people into that, they feel like they know you as a mate. JE I wanted to ask you about ideas, because the stuff I\u2019ve done, there\u2019s been an office full of people whose job it was to find something to do. On Blue Peter, 75% of it was viewer-suggested. Do you have people who suggest content? WL I think it\u2019s important for the ideas to come from you, because it\u2019s your channel. But we get immediate feedback with analytics. You can see the number of people watching your channel over the last 60 minutes, then for each minute, how many times someone clicked on each video. When shows like Love Island are on, there\u2019s no point in uploading, because I can see the huge drop-off. No one is on YouTube at that time. JE Yeah, we owned them: the audience had nowhere else to go. Not just the kids, but the parents, because everyone understands the words Blue Peter. It\u2019s been on now for 60 years. Even by the time I joined, it was 25 years old, and if parents went into the room and their kids were watching they would probably stay, for reasons of nostalgia. I have grandsons now, and they\u2019re all fully YouTube conversant, but it\u2019s not that thing of getting home from school and it\u2019s there, and mum might come in and watch, too. Do you like the fact that it enables young people to have this thing that has nothing to do with us? WL Parents should always be aware of what someone is watching but yes, we specifically target who we think is our demographic. Having said that, I would never put something in my videos that I wouldn\u2019t say to my mum. JE That is an excellent rule. WL That usually helps me walk the line pretty well. I find it liberating. I quite enjoy the responsibility, or burden, of knowing the buck stops with me. JE I left the BBC years ago, but you become a spokesperson for it. I have lost count of the number of times I\u2019ve been asked to defend children\u2019s television, and you will be asked to defend YouTube. WL Yeah, I get that quite a lot. YouTube is very strictly regulated now, whereas maybe it wasn\u2019t seven or eight years ago. There are dos and don\u2019ts. Now, if you say certain jokes, YouTube are not going to put any adverts on your video. I just have to make the decision: is this worth the risk? JE With live telly, people always assume that you\u2019re desperate to swear or do something wrong. But I wouldn\u2019t ever do that. I joined Blue Peter when I was 28, so I wasn\u2019t going to be living a nun-like existence, but the first responsibility was always \u2013 it sounds so prissy \u2013 to the viewer. I don\u2019t want to be the person they see falling over pissed and being horrible to waiters, or something. But this was way before Twitter, paparazzi; I suppose it\u2019s harder now. WL It can be very volatile. There was a big YouTube scandal in 2017 when a lot of advertisers pulled out over concerns about what their adverts appeared on. It had just become my full-time job. I\u2019d moved down to London, I was paying rent, and suddenly you go from getting paid, say, a pound for 1,000 views to 10 pence. JE When the News Of The World published an expos\u00e9 of Richard Bacon, 22, taking cocaine, it was horrible. He\u2019s still one of the best presenters they ever had, and he was immediately sacked and the then head of children\u2019s programmes, Lorraine Heggessey, sat in front of a bowl of daffodils and did this sort of Queen-like speech before the programme went on air, you know: \u201cvery disappointed in the behaviour\u201d. They dragged some of us out of retirement because they were suddenly one presenter down. So I went and did a few programmes. But it was ridiculous. WL That\u2019s a horrible existence that, innit? On the other hand I\u2019ve been doing these live shows and it\u2019s been such a lovely experience and privilege just to speak to people on the street who enjoy what you do. JE YouTube makes people scared, so you have to hold their hands and tell them it\u2019s fine. My 10-year-old grandson has started talking into the camera completely unaffectedly, wandering around the house \u2013 using entirely the wrong angle. WL You\u2019ve got to start somewhere. JE Well, he always starts with: \u201cHey, guys.\u201d WL That\u2019s so sweet. Ten is young for it, but by the time he\u2019s 15, he could get bloody good. I haven\u2019t even been doing it for five years. I hope he keeps doing it. Alice Oswald, 53, Oxford professor of poetry, and Yrsa Daley-Ward, 30, Instagram poet Alice Oswald was elected Oxford professor of poetry in June this year, succeeding Simon Armitage and becoming the first woman in the role. It follows a string of prestigious poetry prizes, and acclaim from her contemporaries: Carol Ann Duffy hailed her \u201cthe best UK poet now writing, bar none\u201d, while Jeanette Winterson said she was \u201cmaking a new kind of poetry\u201d, bringing the countryside, myth and nature to life. Oswald\u2019s career has centred on traditional published collections and literary magazines; by contrast, Yrsa Daley-Ward self-published her debut collection, Bone, in 2014, but rose to prominence after publishing excerpts and new poems on Instagram (she has amassed more than 150,000 followers). These were initially interspersed with photos from her modelling career and videos of live performances. She bristles at the label \u201cInstagram poet\u201d, but the way she posts poetry, sometimes as a screengrab of her Apple Notes app, or scribbled down in a notebook, feels especially urgent. Modelling has mostly been replaced by acting, and she\u2019s currently appearing as Connie in World On Fire, Peter Bowker\u2019s new BBC drama about the second world war. Daley-Ward, who was born in Chorley, Lancashire, and raised in part by strict Seventh-day Adventist grandparents, now lives in New York, from where she spoke on the phone to Alice, who was in her cottage in south Devon. Alice Oswald I think it\u2019s fascinating that poetry has found its way on to Instagram. I wonder whether it might then grow into a form where it\u2019s not so autobiographical, and maybe the images are not personal \u2013 that it might create a form that\u2019s more like Chinese poetry, which tends to be both visual and verbal at the same time. Yrsa Daley-Ward You know, on social media, we can\u2019t hide from the fact that a lot of things are very self-centred. They just are. And if we think about things generationally, as well, people [of my generation] are almost obsessed with our journey, our feelings about this, our trauma. I don\u2019t think you have to be like that to do well on social media. I always hear this thing \u201cInstagram poet\u201d, but often people are using excerpts from much longer works. Do you ever split poems up in that way? Do you see four or five lines from the larger body of work as standing alone, and maybe even meaning something else? AO Yes. I like the notion that the poem is a very intense, airborne thing. One only captures a little bit of the poem you get in a book \u2013 just a trace of some actual alive poem that\u2019s always elsewhere. It does feel as if people are talking more about poetry now, and I\u2019m delighted by that. I was always frustrated that it only ever seemed to put people off when it was taught in schools. It\u2019s exciting that, suddenly, performance poetry and social media poetry have changed that. YD-W I think there\u2019s been a huge surge. People are going into prisons and care units and facilitating the writing of poetry. I\u2019m from a very religious background, so I grew up on biblical text. Also, I\u2019m Jamaican and Nigerian, so I grew up on knowledge of the ancestors or oral storytelling, fables. When that meets this modern way of processing, understanding and speaking about things in a very simple and succinct way, you almost, as the writer, don\u2019t have to make it happen. It\u2019s already there. AO For me, poetry is all about expressing the fact that I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. Does that have any resonance with you? YD-W I\u2019m interested in what I do know and what I don\u2019t know. I think I found poetry because I wanted to talk about things that were in front of me. But I don\u2019t always understand a feeling before it\u2019s on the page. So I think the genesis of it is still what I don\u2019t know. Then somewhere in that process, it becomes very personal. AO When I was younger I used to suffer from that panic of, \u201cOh I\u2019m never going to write again, this has gone.\u201d Now I am happy to sit or walk, waiting for a poem. It\u2019s not really up to me \u2013 I just have to do the listening. YD-W I know I want to be very serene, and not that intentional. Which is why I write in the morning because then everything still feels possible. I feel open and not too much has happened in the day to make me distracted. AO I, too, love the early morning \u2013 to get up before anyone else is awake, drink strong coffee. That does offer a kind of clarity that isn\u2019t always there in the rest of the day. But I do notice that, however much I try to say to myself that it\u2019s a daily discipline, probably the more inventive poems emerge at times when things aren\u2019t manageable. YD-W Yeah, I agree \u2013 I think because the mind has to go somewhere. AO That\u2019s exactly it. If you reach impossibility, then that\u2019s when the imagination kicks in, I think. YD-W There\u2019s a passion that comes during those times. Where you put your energies is particularly surprising and important. AO Yes, I remember when I was 20 or so, and I decided to try writing so-called free verse. I remember feeling physical panic as I was doing it, which was exhilarating. But I think the things poetry summons up are quite terrifying. YD-W Absolutely. But I think we can always rest in the knowledge that the work stands alone. When somebody is there with your book, you\u2019re not there in person. It\u2019s no longer about you. AO There\u2019s a difference between Alice and Alice Oswald, and I spend most of my time trying to escape Alice Oswald. I hate her. If she is anywhere near me when I\u2019m trying to write, that\u2019s a disaster. So I have good ways of getting rid of her. I find her entirely fictional and redundant. I like the thing you say somewhere: \u201cYou know you\u2019re writing the truth when you\u2019re terrified.\u201d YD-W I think that whenever you are nervous that you\u2019re revealing yourself, or that you\u2019re saying something you haven\u2019t said before \u2013 that\u2019s when you\u2019re striking something important. \u2022 If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication).",

      "body": "<p>After more than three years of parliamentary events touted as momentous, we will get one that definitely lives up to the billing \u2013 the first Saturday sitting of the Commons since the Falklands conflict, in which there will be a potentially knife-edge vote on a plan that could shape the UK\u2019s future for a generation.</p> <h2>What is the schedule for Saturday?</h2> <p>The Commons <a href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201920/cmagenda/OP191019.pdf\">convenes at 9.30am</a> with a statement from Boris Johnson on the Brexit deal he has negotiated with the EU, followed by questions.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f254e43d24c8e44b3c57a6ca48fd9cbaa99852e2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f254e43d24c8e44b3c57a6ca48fd9cbaa99852e2/0_319_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson speaking during a debate in the House of Commons\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson will begin proceedings with a statement.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jessica Taylor/UK PARLIAMENT HANDOUT/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The motion on the deal follows afterwards, to be opened by another minister. It is only when this debate begins that we will know which amendments have been selected for a vote by the Speaker, John Bercow.</p> <p>The number of amendments will affect the length of the process, so the key vote could come any time from mid-afternoon to early evening. If the government loses the vote, the prime minister could then seek a vote on leaving without a deal, which is the only other way to avoid the so-called Benn act \u2013 the backbench-created law that would compel Johnson to seek a Brexit extension if his deal is not passed or no deal is not approved.</p> <h2>Will there be amendments?</h2> <p>Some have already been tabled, for example one to extend the Brexit deadline. Another amendment <a href=\"https://twitter.com/peterkyle/status/1185215551267921920\">has been tabled</a> to secure a second referendum, but this would be attached to the no-deal motion, so seems unlikely to go to a vote.</p> <h2>Will there definitely be an all-or-nothing vote?</h2> <p>The big decision could be delayed again. A potentially key amendment tabled by Oliver Letwin, Hilary Benn and others would withhold full approval for the Brexit deal until all the associated legislation was passed.</p> <p>This would seem likely to require another extension, and would delay the real moment of truth for MPs. One reason for this amendment would be to prevent the possibility of hardline Brexit Conservatives approving the deal \u2013 thus removing the conditions of the Benn act \u2013 but then voting down the subsequent withdrawal agreement bill, which implements the legally binding treaty, and so forcing no deal anyway.</p> <p>Labour is understood to be likely to back this amendment, and former Tory MPs including Amber Rudd and David Gauke have said they would vote for it.</p> <h2>Will MPs know the full implications of the deal?</h2> <p>Not really. The deal was cobbled together and agreed with the EU in a huge rush, and MPs will have only a few hours of debate in the Commons before making a hugely important decision. Downing Street has said MPs will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/oct/18/boris-johnson-launches-frantic-sales-pitch-of-brexit-deal-ahead-of-commons-vote-politics-live?page=with:block-5da998ac8f08993584c890e8#block-5da998ac8f08993584c890e8\">not see official economic impact assessments</a> of the plan in advance, despite some requesting this.</p> <h2>What happens if the plan passes?</h2> <p>If it passes unamended, this would still be the first stage of the process, and even with Downing Street promising that MPs would work around the clock as needed, there is no guarantee everything will be done by 31 October. No 10 would hope to present the bill to the Commons as early as Monday. If the deal motion is amended, for example by the Letwin-Benn plan, a delay to departure is more likely.</p> <h2>Do we get no deal if the plan is rejected?</h2> <p>Most likely not, even though Johnson seems set to frame the vote in these terms, and the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, briefly startled remain-minded MPs by telling reporters <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2019/oct/17/it-has-to-be-now-jean-claude-juncker-claims-eu-wont-further-delay-brexit-video\">he did not think</a> another Brexit extension would be granted. EU sources <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/17/boris-johnson-and-eu-reach-brexit-deal-without-dup-backing\">have said</a> that if Johnson\u2019s deal is rejected, meaning the Benn act would come into force, they would not reject a UK request for another extension.</p> <h2>Which MPs are key to whether it passes?</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7f5f5544599078b13c426649b4ebeb467bc10556\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7f5f5544599078b13c426649b4ebeb467bc10556/431_288_2943_1766/1000.jpg\" alt=\"DUP deputy leader, Nigel Dodds, and leader, Arlene Foster, have said they won\u2019t back the deal.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The DUP deputy leader, Nigel Dodds, and leader, Arlene Foster, have said they won\u2019t back the deal.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rebecca Black/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With the DUP <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/17/dup-boris-johnson-brexit-deal\">definitely against</a> the deal, and a number of the former Tory MPs who lost the whip last month seemingly onboard, two groups will be vital. First are the so-called \u201cSpartans\u201d, the most hardline of Tory Brexiters. Some of these have already said they would back the bill, and others could follow \u2013 but with the DUP opposed, this is still a finely balanced decision.</p> <p>The other group set to be endlessly pestered by Johnson\u2019s team are Labour MPs from leave-voting areas who support a deal, such as Caroline Flint, Stephen Kinnock and others. They <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/18/john-mcdonnell-expects-labour-mps-to-hold-firm-on-brexit-deal\">face intense Labour pressure</a> to vote against it, but could still potentially be persuaded the vote the other way. These MPs might be more likely to back the deal if it was amended via the Letwin-Benn plan.</p> <h2>So will it pass \u2013 and if so, is it all over?</h2> <p>On the first point \u2013 no one knows. The final tally could come within a couple of votes. It is worth remembering that Theresa May\u2019s defeats on her Brexit deal ended up being heavier than expected. However, some momentum seem to be with Johnson. As to the second question: no, not at all. Even if the deal is passed, this is but the first step in a long parliamentary process, which would in turn shape an evolving and still very controversial departure process over many years. Prepare for much, much more of this.</p> <h2>MPs to watch</h2> <p><strong>Steve Baker: </strong>the Tory hard Brexiters\u2019 club, the European Research Group, met first thing on Saturday. Its chair has told the group that they should vote for Johnson\u2019s deal. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aa72491b79d99487b9a59027b4b735a4bc2cc712\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aa72491b79d99487b9a59027b4b735a4bc2cc712/0_88_1181_708/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Steve Baker\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The ERG chair, Steve Baker, is likely to be a key indicator for the Spartans\u2019 voting intentions.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Brady/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Philip Hammond:</strong> on the other side of the Tory divide, the former chancellor is prominent among the sizeable group of rebel MPs who lost the whip last month, who could go either way.</p> <p><strong>Caroline Flint:</strong> co-leader of the \u201cMPs for a deal\u201d grouping, Flint is a leading member of the Labour contingent who believe the UK should leave sooner rather than later.

      "bodyText": "After more than three years of parliamentary events touted as momentous, we will get one that definitely lives up to the billing \u2013 the first Saturday sitting of the Commons since the Falklands conflict, in which there will be a potentially knife-edge vote on a plan that could shape the UK\u2019s future for a generation. What is the schedule for Saturday? The Commons convenes at 9.30am with a statement from Boris Johnson on the Brexit deal he has negotiated with the EU, followed by questions. The motion on the deal follows afterwards, to be opened by another minister. It is only when this debate begins that we will know which amendments have been selected for a vote by the Speaker, John Bercow. The number of amendments will affect the length of the process, so the key vote could come any time from mid-afternoon to early evening. If the government loses the vote, the prime minister could then seek a vote on leaving without a deal, which is the only other way to avoid the so-called Benn act \u2013 the backbench-created law that would compel Johnson to seek a Brexit extension if his deal is not passed or no deal is not approved. Will there be amendments? Some have already been tabled, for example one to extend the Brexit deadline. Another amendment has been tabled to secure a second referendum, but this would be attached to the no-deal motion, so seems unlikely to go to a vote. Will there definitely be an all-or-nothing vote? The big decision could be delayed again. A potentially key amendment tabled by Oliver Letwin, Hilary Benn and others would withhold full approval for the Brexit deal until all the associated legislation was passed. This would seem likely to require another extension, and would delay the real moment of truth for MPs. One reason for this amendment would be to prevent the possibility of hardline Brexit Conservatives approving the deal \u2013 thus removing the conditions of the Benn act \u2013 but then voting down the subsequent withdrawal agreement bill, which implements the legally binding treaty, and so forcing no deal anyway. Labour is understood to be likely to back this amendment, and former Tory MPs including Amber Rudd and David Gauke have said they would vote for it. Will MPs know the full implications of the deal? Not really. The deal was cobbled together and agreed with the EU in a huge rush, and MPs will have only a few hours of debate in the Commons before making a hugely important decision. Downing Street has said MPs will not see official economic impact assessments of the plan in advance, despite some requesting this. What happens if the plan passes? If it passes unamended, this would still be the first stage of the process, and even with Downing Street promising that MPs would work around the clock as needed, there is no guarantee everything will be done by 31 October. No 10 would hope to present the bill to the Commons as early as Monday. If the deal motion is amended, for example by the Letwin-Benn plan, a delay to departure is more likely. Do we get no deal if the plan is rejected? Most likely not, even though Johnson seems set to frame the vote in these terms, and the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, briefly startled remain-minded MPs by telling reporters he did not think another Brexit extension would be granted. EU sources have said that if Johnson\u2019s deal is rejected, meaning the Benn act would come into force, they would not reject a UK request for another extension. Which MPs are key to whether it passes? With the DUP definitely against the deal, and a number of the former Tory MPs who lost the whip last month seemingly onboard, two groups will be vital. First are the so-called \u201cSpartans\u201d, the most hardline of Tory Brexiters. Some of these have already said they would back the bill, and others could follow \u2013 but with the DUP opposed, this is still a finely balanced decision. The other group set to be endlessly pestered by Johnson\u2019s team are Labour MPs from leave-voting areas who support a deal, such as Caroline Flint, Stephen Kinnock and others. They face intense Labour pressure to vote against it, but could still potentially be persuaded the vote the other way. These MPs might be more likely to back the deal if it was amended via the Letwin-Benn plan. So will it pass \u2013 and if so, is it all over? On the first point \u2013 no one knows. The final tally could come within a couple of votes. It is worth remembering that Theresa May\u2019s defeats on her Brexit deal ended up being heavier than expected. However, some momentum seem to be with Johnson. As to the second question: no, not at all. Even if the deal is passed, this is but the first step in a long parliamentary process, which would in turn shape an evolving and still very controversial departure process over many years. Prepare for much, much more of this. MPs to watch Steve Baker: the Tory hard Brexiters\u2019 club, the European Research Group, met first thing on Saturday. Its chair has told the group that they should vote for Johnson\u2019s deal. Philip Hammond: on the other side of the Tory divide, the former chancellor is prominent among the sizeable group of rebel MPs who lost the whip last month, who could go either way. Caroline Flint: co-leader of the \u201cMPs for a deal\u201d grouping, Flint is a leading member of the Labour contingent who believe the UK should leave sooner rather than later. If she backs Johnson\u2019s deal she could take others with her. Norman Lamb: while the rest of the Liberal Democrats are firmly against the deal, Lamb \u2013 who will step down at the next election \u2013 has long been much more Brexit-minded than his colleagues. However, he said on Saturday morning he could not support the deal. Pundits to follow Catherine Haddon: fellow at the Institute for Government and self-described \u201cconstitutional agony aunt\u201d. Anand Menon: politics academic-turned head of the UK in a Changing Europe thinktank. Steve Peers: Essex University EU law professor and outlet for well-informed, remain-minded analysis. Ruth Fox: as head of the Hansard Society, the independent authority on parliamentary matters, she is a good bet for procedural conundrums.

She said: \u201cHaving that exposed to me at such a young age made me reassess my priorities.\u201d She finds that older people often compare the current climate crisis movement with the protests over nuclear weapons in the 1950s and 60s. But for her, they are not the same: \u201cWe are the first generation which has been completely united by such an existential universal threat.\u201d That is why XR Youth is not afraid to stand its ground in the broader XR movement. Back in July, the group democratically voted against any involvement in the Heathrow disruption plans, and members have placed a greater emphasis on climate justice by working closely with the Internationalist Solidarity Network to provide support to indigenous groups and those in the global south who are the frontline of the climate crisis. Hollie Andrews, 21, helped set up XR Youth earlier this year, as part of a group who felt they were not getting the support they needed as young people within the rebellion. \u201cWe\u2019re challenging the main XR a lot, we\u2019re seeing what we don\u2019t like and trying to fix that with XR Youth,\u201d she said. \u201cXR isn\u2019t perfect but give us a better alternative. There isn\u2019t one, I don\u2019t think.\u201d Coverage of XR\u2019s rebellion has been dominated by the number of arrests, but the XR Youth team are keen not to glorify this. While some members perceive the threat of arrest as \u201cmeaningless\u201d in the face of such an uncertain future, others think the arrest burden should fall on older people. XR Youth coordinator Savannah Lovelock, 20, said: \u201cAdults need to be accountable to the young people, and if that means going on the streets and getting arrested in the thousands so we can have a chance of getting to the government and saying what we think should happen, then I think that should be the strategy.\u201d For them, the fight is not just about the climate crisis but also the system they have grown up in and the impact this has had on their mental health. Daniel Walsh, 17, is part of XR Youth London and has been arrested five times for his part in the protests. He said: \u201cYoung people already have to face the problems of social media and body image issues \u2026 and now you\u2019ve got the climate crisis to deal with as well. For some people, it has tipped them to breaking point. Certainly for me, XR has kept me alive. I was depressed before I was part of XR.\u201d Reflecting back on their time in XR Youth, the members seem most proud of the communities that have been built and the friendships they\u2019ve forged through the movement. \u201cRebellion isn\u2019t just going on the street and getting arrested, it\u2019s also rebelling against a system that makes us lonely and have no purpose,\u201d said Lovelock. \u201cIt\u2019s about creating those communities where people are held in their grief and their terror of what\u2019s going on.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Anyone who knows anything about the American author Michelle Tea will recognise the joke in the title of this collection of journalism. More than most, she has made an industry out of writing her own life, either in straight-up memoir or adapted into autofiction (most recently, 2016\u2019s bracingly apocalyptic <em>Black Wave</em>). But, as she admits in the title piece here, it\u2019s something she feels ambivalent about. At a reading, Tea meets the woman for whom a long-ago ex left her, and on whom she revenged herself in the novel <em>Valencia</em>: \u201cTimes change and people change and new information comes to light, and forever in the pages of that book Sara is the destroyer of my young lesbian romance. I am forever done wrong.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s an anxiety about the way writing can trap us in our own past selves, and it might explain one of the strangest features of <em>Against Memoir</em>, which is that several of these articles have been unsubtly amended to be more representative of the contemporary Tea than the one who originally wrote them. The effect is disconcerting. You can be rattling along under the spell of, say, 2003 Tea (and she is an intoxicating writer, a mix of swagger and bathos, delivering sentences that land with the snap and force of a punch); then suddenly a voice cuts in from the present, and the whole vehicle shudders on its wheels.</p> <p>Take the series of pieces she wrote for the now-defunct website xoJane about rebuilding her teenage record collection. In the throes of what she describes as her \u201cRadical Lesbian Separatist Nervous Breakdown\u201d, she moved to California and left her once-beloved vinyl behind in her Massachusetts hometown. That music belonged to her adolescent immersion in goth and punk, she writes, and it \u201cmade no sense with this new me who had chopped off her hair, gone vegan, sold all her \u2018objectifying\u2019 clothing, and was busy purging all male-created culture from her life\u201d. But in the 2010s, she\u2019s a settled adult with an apartment, a girlfriend and a record player, and there\u2019s space for Gene Loves Jezebel and Sonic Youth in her life once again.</p> <p>One of the bands she goes back to in 2012 is Minor Threat, whose frontman Ian MacKaye holds personal significance for Tea in two ways. Firstly, he was an outspoken advocate for feminism in the generally macho DC hardcore scene (later, he lent his muscle to the burgeoning Riot Grrrl scene, with which Tea was associated); second, he was the face of the Straight Edge movement, which eschewed drink and drunks, and held an otherworldly fascination for Tea as she was swirling into the addictions that would dominate her early adulthood.</p> <p>But those themes fall by the wayside when the revising voice sweeps in, denouncing MacKaye for clueless racial politics in one song: \u201cIn an earlier version of this essay I all but let MacKaye off the hook for \u2018Guilty of Being White\u2019, guilty as I am of the same white laziness he continues to suffer from.\u201d How applicable the word \u201ccontinues\u201d is seems questionable, since it was recorded in 1981, when MacKaye was 19 \u2013 he too has been snared in a past version of himself, cast as a foil so that Tea can separate herself from the 2012 Michelle who wasn\u2019t quite so fluent in the language of privilege as feminist writers have subsequently had to become under threat of cancellation.</p> <p>The same evolution of mores is apparent in the version of \u201cTransmissions from Camp Trans\u201d that appears here, a report on protests against the Michigan Womyn\u2019s music festival for its female-only attendance policy, originally published by the Believer in 2003. In the intervening 16 years, the schism over gender has grown more savage, and MichFest held its last event in 2015 following years of pressure and harassment from those who considered it transphobic. And so the article itself has become more savage.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The book suffers from bittiness as Tea moves from smartmouthed blogging to frank and fierce pieces about her pregnancies</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>New additions accuse the festival of \u201ccommitting suicide rather than sharing its magic\u201d, and hope that, as older lesbians \u201cage and die so will their fearful reactionary points of view\u201d. That last cruelty is thrown into almost-comic relief when, three pages later, in the text of a speech called \u201cHow Not to Be a Queer Douchebag\u201d, she commands her audience to \u201cStop policing each other like little queer police officers\u201d (unless the people they\u2019re policing are lesbians born before Tea, who hold unacceptable beliefs, I guess). This is the whiplash way of Tea: passionate attachments, lightly worn.</p> <p>As a collection, this book suffers from the bittiness that afflicts many writers who work for multiple outlets primarily on the internet. One thing Tea hasn\u2019t tried to fix for republication is the jolt of moving from smartmouthed xoJane-style blogging to the frank and fierce pieces about her own pregnancies or her family\u2019s poverty that ran in<a href=\"https://nplusonemag.com/\" title=\"\"> N+1</a> and Harper\u2019s. But the jaggedness is also the point. <em>Against Memoir</em> chronicles a spectacularly fraught couple of decades for feminism and lesbianism, sometimes dramatising those stresses in the clash of voices between then-Michelle and now-Michelle. Times change and people change and new information comes to light, but Tea crashes on in the thrilling project of continually inventing herself.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Against Memoir is published by And Other Stories (\u00a310).

One of the bands she goes back to in 2012 is Minor Threat, whose frontman Ian MacKaye holds personal significance for Tea in two ways. Firstly, he was an outspoken advocate for feminism in the generally macho DC hardcore scene (later, he lent his muscle to the burgeoning Riot Grrrl scene, with which Tea was associated); second, he was the face of the Straight Edge movement, which eschewed drink and drunks, and held an otherworldly fascination for Tea as she was swirling into the addictions that would dominate her early adulthood. But those themes fall by the wayside when the revising voice sweeps in, denouncing MacKaye for clueless racial politics in one song: \u201cIn an earlier version of this essay I all but let MacKaye off the hook for \u2018Guilty of Being White\u2019, guilty as I am of the same white laziness he continues to suffer from.\u201d How applicable the word \u201ccontinues\u201d is seems questionable, since it was recorded in 1981, when MacKaye was 19 \u2013 he too has been snared in a past version of himself, cast as a foil so that Tea can separate herself from the 2012 Michelle who wasn\u2019t quite so fluent in the language of privilege as feminist writers have subsequently had to become under threat of cancellation. The same evolution of mores is apparent in the version of \u201cTransmissions from Camp Trans\u201d that appears here, a report on protests against the Michigan Womyn\u2019s music festival for its female-only attendance policy, originally published by the Believer in 2003. In the intervening 16 years, the schism over gender has grown more savage, and MichFest held its last event in 2015 following years of pressure and harassment from those who considered it transphobic. And so the article itself has become more savage. New additions accuse the festival of \u201ccommitting suicide rather than sharing its magic\u201d, and hope that, as older lesbians \u201cage and die so will their fearful reactionary points of view\u201d. That last cruelty is thrown into almost-comic relief when, three pages later, in the text of a speech called \u201cHow Not to Be a Queer Douchebag\u201d, she commands her audience to \u201cStop policing each other like little queer police officers\u201d (unless the people they\u2019re policing are lesbians born before Tea, who hold unacceptable beliefs, I guess). This is the whiplash way of Tea: passionate attachments, lightly worn. As a collection, this book suffers from the bittiness that afflicts many writers who work for multiple outlets primarily on the internet. One thing Tea hasn\u2019t tried to fix for republication is the jolt of moving from smartmouthed xoJane-style blogging to the frank and fierce pieces about her own pregnancies or her family\u2019s poverty that ran in N+1 and Harper\u2019s. But the jaggedness is also the point. Against Memoir chronicles a spectacularly fraught couple of decades for feminism and lesbianism, sometimes dramatising those stresses in the clash of voices between then-Michelle and now-Michelle. Times change and people change and new information comes to light, but Tea crashes on in the thrilling project of continually inventing herself. \u2022 Against Memoir is published by And Other Stories (\u00a310).

In a triumphal speech to the Liberal party\u2019s federal council in Canberra on Saturday, Morrison again said the drought was \u201cthe most pressing and biggest call on our budget\u201d. \u201cIt is the first cab off the rank, the first thing we sit together and say, \u2018Once we have done everything we can in this area, then we can consider other priorities\u2019. \u201cIt is the biggest call on the budget because it is the most pressing, the rock I\u2019m going to put in the jar first. It is the first call because that is what is needed in our rural and regional communities. They know we cannot make it rain and they know we cannot make it like it was before the drought.\u201d The prime minister did not mention the climate crisis while detailing the government\u2019s three-phase drought response package thus far: the farm household allowance for eligible farming families; the drought communities program dedicating $100m to councils affected by the drought; and long-term drought resilience plans, including money for new dams and the drought future fund. \u201cThat is what we are doing on drought and we will keep responding,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cWe will keep going and delivering. That is why you need resilient and strong budget. That is why we will not walk away.\u201d But the budget is coming under significant pressure, with a sharp downturn in the economic outlook. The IMF this week forecast a global \u201csynchronised slowdown\u201d of world economies, and a \u201cprecarious outlook\u201d for recovery. Australia is forecast to grow more slowly than Greece, with 1.7% growth in 2019, a full percentage point below 2018\u2019s 2.7%. But the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg \u2013 currently at the G20 \u2013 has said additional drought support would not sacrifice the surplus, saying natural disasters had been taken into account when the Coalition made its pre-election pledge to return the budget to balance and then surplus next year. The midyear economic and fiscal outlook (MYEFO) will come out before Christmas. Any additional drought spending is likely to be detailed there. The government has been criticised by Labor for moving too slowly on the drought. Accusing the government of \u201csix years of inaction\u201d, Labor\u2019s Joel Fitzgibbon has called for a bipartisan drought war cabinet to be established. \u201cWhat began as crisis for our farmers fast moved to a crisis for our rural townships, which are literally running out of water,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I fear that we now are fast approaching a threat to our food security \u2026 We need to sit the major parties down together and to start making some pretty significant decisions.\u201d The drought response has also been questioned by some councils, including Moyne shire in south-west Victoria, which was given $1m despite not being in drought and whose mayor said he wanted to refuse it. \u201cOur council has never applied for funding under this drought package or any other similar program of drought-assistance funding,\u201d Moyne shire council mayor Mick Wolfe said. Morrison\u2019s speech to the party faithful in Canberra was a triumphal affair, given the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the party\u2019s founding by Robert Menzies, the Coalition\u2019s unexpected election win in May and his own rise to unchallenged authority within the party. He condemned the Labor party for what he described as its \u201cpanic in a crisis\u201d and \u201cpolitics of envy\u201d, in particular highlighting the party\u2019s current corruption issues in NSW. The Liberal party federal council will also debate a series of motions from various branches of the party. The Young Liberals called on the party to \u201creaffirm its strong support for freedom of speech and the rule of law around the world and supports the right of the people of Hong Kong to protests peacefully in defence of those freedoms\u201d. The Morrison government\u2019s rhetoric towards China has become increasingly bellicose in recent weeks: the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, accused the Chinese Communist Party of political repression, intellectual property theft and cyber hacking; the foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, has been forthright in her demands over detained Australian writer Yang Hengjun; while Morrison has taken an uncompromising position on China\u2019s \u201cdeveloping nation\u201d status at the WTO. However, it\u2019s unclear whether an overtly political motion such as the Young Liberals\u2019 support for Hong Kong will win broader party support. The ACT branch of the Liberal party has called on the government to \u201cprioritise a free trade agreement with the UK over the European Union\u201d and also wants the government to reject European demands for \u201cgeographic indicators\u201d on food products in Australia, such as on feta, gruyere and gorgonzola cheeses. The ACT Liberals also want investigation of \u201cinnovative financing options\u201d for a high-speed rail linking Australia\u2019s east-coast capitals. And the West Australian branch want legislation mandating that public funding for both \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno\u201d campaigns be equal at all future constitutional referenda, a legacy of the marriage equality campaign.",

I used that for motivation and determination, and I promised myself that I was gonna get gold next time I got in that tournament.\u201d He did just that, unseating the incumbent champion at 152lbs and winning the Sugar Ray Robinson award as the tournament\u2019s best open class boxer. He then went on to win the US nationals, earning the No 1 national ranking in his weight class, and was a 2012 Olympic alternate.</p> <p>DiBella noticed immediately that he had a different vibe from most of the other fighters.</p> <p>\u201cHe clearly didn\u2019t need to do it, and if it wasn\u2019t such a passion for him and he wasn\u2019t compelled by whatever lies within his soul to do it, do I think a kid like this would have been better without it?

      "bodyText": "Two days before fight night, Patrick Day walked to the podium for the event\u2019s final press conference. He complimented Chicago, a city he said reminded him of New York, \u201cjust less crowded\u201d. He then remarked that the other fighters looked fit and healthy, and promised an entertaining fight with Charles Conwell. He sounded more like the promoter than one of the participants, a point he addressed. \u201cPeople look at me, look at my demeanor, and say, \u2018Oh you\u2019re such a nice guy, well-spoken, why do you choose to box?\u2019 It\u2019s about what\u2019s in your heart \u2026 I have a fighter\u2019s soul, a fighter\u2019s spirit, and I love this sport,\u201d Day said. \u201cBoxing makes me happy, that\u2019s why I choose to do it.\u201d It\u2019s a question that has been repeated in the days that followed, though the tenses have changed. Day lapsed into a coma after being knocked out, less than 100 seconds before the bout\u2019s scheduled conclusion. Emergency brain surgery was performed, but he died Wednesday, four days after the fight, aged 27. In a sport where everyone is fighting for a piece of the same pie, Day was the rare example of someone universally well-liked by peer and promoter alike. He had been a standout student at his high school in Freeport, Long Island, and earned his associate\u2019s degree in Nutrition at Nassau Community College, and later obtained his Bachelor\u2019s in Health and Wellness through online classes at Kaplan University (now known as Purdue University Global).

      "body": "<p>Northern Rock, Equitable Life, Icesave, New Star \u2026 and now Woodford Investment Management. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/neil-woodford\" title=\"\">Neil Woodford</a>\u2019s investment business is the latest on the list of companies that have either collapsed, nearly gone under or been shut down.</p> <p>Woodford <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/15/neil-woodford-equity-income-fund-wound-up\" title=\"\">announced on Tuesday</a> that he was closing his business after being fired from his flagship fund, Woodford Equity Income, which will now be wound up. Investors in this fund will get their money back in stages, but should brace themselves for heavy losses \u2013 and it could be a year or more before the final payments are made.</p> <h2><strong>What\u2019s happened?</strong></h2> <p>In June, Woodford <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/jun/08/are-your-savings-trapped-in-neil-woodford-fund\" title=\"\">suspended all trading in the fund</a> after being overwhelmed by customer withdrawals following a series of bad market bets. Woodford was fired and the administrators, Link Fund Solutions, said it was \u201cin the best interests of all investors\u201d for the fund to be wound up.</p> <h2><strong>How many investors are there?</strong></h2> <p>Several hundred thousand.</p> <h2><strong>What now?</strong></h2> <p>LFS says the plan is to return investors\u2019 cash \u201cat the earliest opportunity\u201d. The winding up of the fund will start on 17 January, and the money will be returned in chunks. The first payment could be made by the end of January after some of the easier-to-sell assets have been flogged. The \u201cunquoted and less liquid\u201d assets will be sold off over time. Unfortunately, says LFS, it is not possible to predict when the sale process will be completed.</p> <h2><strong>How much will people get back?</strong></h2> <p>We don\u2019t know yet. \u201cSadly, many people will be looking at significant losses,\u201d reckons Adrian Lowcock at the investment firm Willis Owen.</p> <p>Ryan Hughes at the investment platform AJ Bell says that while investors will not be charged direct fees while all this happens, they will still be incurring high costs for the winding up of the fund \u2013 particularly relating to offloading the tricky-to-sell assets. \u201cThese costs will be taken out of any proceeds from the sale,\u201d he adds.</p> <p>As of the middle of this week, Woodford Equity Income had returned a loss of about 26% over the past year.</p> <h2><strong>Might I have money in the fund but not know it?</strong></h2> <p>It\u2019s possible. For example, six of Hargreaves Lansdown\u2019s multi-manager funds are invested in it. They include the \u00a32.7bn Multi-Manager Income &amp; Growth fund. At the end of September, about 11% of this fund was invested in Woodford\u2019s fund.</p> <h2><strong>What about the Financial Services Compensation Scheme?</strong></h2> <p>The FSCS can pay compensation if a financial firm is unable to pay back money it owes. Before it can pay redress, it must be satisfied that a firm does not have sufficient assets to meet claims. The FSCS says it is not expecting to be involved, but it is monitoring developments.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Northern Rock, Equitable Life, Icesave, New Star \u2026 and now Woodford Investment Management. Neil Woodford\u2019s investment business is the latest on the list of companies that have either collapsed, nearly gone under or been shut down. Woodford announced on Tuesday that he was closing his business after being fired from his flagship fund, Woodford Equity Income, which will now be wound up. Investors in this fund will get their money back in stages, but should brace themselves for heavy losses \u2013 and it could be a year or more before the final payments are made. What\u2019s happened? In June, Woodford suspended all trading in the fund after being overwhelmed by customer withdrawals following a series of bad market bets. Woodford was fired and the administrators, Link Fund Solutions, said it was \u201cin the best interests of all investors\u201d for the fund to be wound up. How many investors are there? Several hundred thousand. What now? LFS says the plan is to return investors\u2019 cash \u201cat the earliest opportunity\u201d. The winding up of the fund will start on 17 January, and the money will be returned in chunks. The first payment could be made by the end of January after some of the easier-to-sell assets have been flogged. The \u201cunquoted and less liquid\u201d assets will be sold off over time. Unfortunately, says LFS, it is not possible to predict when the sale process will be completed. How much will people get back? We don\u2019t know yet. \u201cSadly, many people will be looking at significant losses,\u201d reckons Adrian Lowcock at the investment firm Willis Owen. Ryan Hughes at the investment platform AJ Bell says that while investors will not be charged direct fees while all this happens, they will still be incurring high costs for the winding up of the fund \u2013 particularly relating to offloading the tricky-to-sell assets. \u201cThese costs will be taken out of any proceeds from the sale,\u201d he adds. As of the middle of this week, Woodford Equity Income had returned a loss of about 26% over the past year. Might I have money in the fund but not know it? It\u2019s possible. For example, six of Hargreaves Lansdown\u2019s multi-manager funds are invested in it. They include the \u00a32.7bn Multi-Manager Income &amp; Growth fund. At the end of September, about 11% of this fund was invested in Woodford\u2019s fund. What about the Financial Services Compensation Scheme? The FSCS can pay compensation if a financial firm is unable to pay back money it owes. Before it can pay redress, it must be satisfied that a firm does not have sufficient assets to meet claims. The FSCS says it is not expecting to be involved, but it is monitoring developments.",

      "body": "<p>The theatre formerly known as the West Yorkshire Playhouse has reopened after 15 months of renovation. It has reverted to its original name of Leeds Playhouse, which is clearer. The main entrance now overlooks the city, which is bolder. Auditoria and front-of-house areas have been spruced up, lightened, made easier for wheelchair users. And, in an unused hollow at the bottom of the building, a new studio theatre has been created. The uncompromisingly named <a href=\"https://leedsplayhouse.org.uk/latest_news/major-boost-west-yorkshire-playhouse-redevelopment/\" title=\"\">Bramall Rock Void </a>(which has a totemic pile of masonry at the side of the entrance) seats 120.

Its opening production comes through with flying colours.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://leedsplayhouse.org.uk/events/there-are-no-beginnings/\" title=\"\">There Are No Beginnings</a></strong> is not the first play to show a region shaken to its core by a serial killer of women. It\u2019s a subject that provoked Liverpool Everyman\u2019s lacerating <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2006/mar/26/theatre\" title=\"\">Unprotected</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2006/mar/26/theatre\" title=\"\"> </a>in 2006 and, five years later, the National Theatre\u2019s unsettling <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/apr/17/london-road-betty-blue-eyes-precious-little-talent\" title=\"\">London Road</a></em>. Still, <a href=\"http://painesplough.com/person/charley-miles\" title=\"\">Charley Miles</a>\u2019s play belongs to Leeds. Set in the city between 1975 and 1980, when Peter Sutcliffe, the Yorkshire Ripper, was at large, it features neither Sutcliffe nor the women he murdered. Miles\u2019s concern is with the effect the killings had on all women\u2019s behaviour. How, living with a running commentary of terror (\u201cGrrrrruuuuesome\u201d, rasps the radio) they began always to lock their doors. How they were roused to anger by the advice that they, rather than men, should observe a curfew. How they came together to protest; how distinctions made on grounds of \u201cdecency\u201d \u2013 on whether a woman was a prostitute \u2013 began to be questioned. Meanwhile, the floor in the police department holding the reports on the killings began to sag under the weight of the paperwork.</p> <p>After some artful opening flutters, Amy Leach\u2019s production is direct, personal and crisp. And often funny. The speeches of the four-strong cast are based on dozens of interviews Miles conducted with women who were in Leeds in the 70s; the performances are exceptionally distilled. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/aug/11/julie-hesmondhalgh-interview-edinburgh-fringe-the-greatest-play-in-the-history-of-the-world\" title=\"\">Julie Hesmondhalgh</a>, sombre, merry, stolid in her pinny while she runs a women\u2019s refuge. As her daughter, Tessa Parr moves dextrously from being a Donny Osmond adorer to a woolly-hatted protester, always slipping between pert and precarious. Jesse Jones is cleverly inscrutable as the ambitious, wary young policewoman. Natalie Gavin \u2013 the working girl \u2013 is remarkable: she never cries, but her face seems to be bruised with tears. The women put on their costumes in full view of the audience in the opening moments, as if to say we could any of us put on each other\u2019s skin.</p> <p>Stanis\u0142aw Lem\u2019s 1961 novel <strong><a href=\"https://lyric.co.uk/shows/solaris/\" title=\"\">Solaris</a></strong> is a tremendous lure and snare for any adapter. The real yeast of the fiction is not plot but a stirring central concept: the idea that on a distant planet there is an ocean that has consciousness: a cerebral sea which, when approached by humans, seems to give physical substance to their thoughts and fantasies. This is not as easy to embody as a gloomy love entanglement, and it was that gooier aspect to which both Steven Soderbergh and Andrei Tarkovsky were drawn \u2013 to Lem\u2019s dismay. He thought Tarkovsky\u2019s jowly 1971 film \u201camputated the scientific landscape\u201d. Reimagining <em>Solaris</em> for the stage (in a co-production with the Lyric, Melbourne\u2019s Malthouse Theatre and the Royal Lyceum in Edinburgh), David Greig has some fun with the romance: the fantasy love object bops to the Beach Boys. Greig and director Matthew Lutton don\u2019t indulge in the \u201cemotional sauce\u201d that so repelled Lem, and they do go some way to catching the all-encompassing impersonality of that ocean, in black-and-white videos of surging waves and in lighting by Paul Jackson that flushes and blanches and blues the stage.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8d153e186182518ce22859654f00ccfc3515e465\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d153e186182518ce22859654f00ccfc3515e465/820_641_4152_2491/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Polly Frame in Solaris.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Polly Frame in Solaris.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mihaela Bodlovic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s a coolly intriguing evening.

      "body": "<p>Chidera Eggerue, AKA The Slumflower, is a social media star, south-east London homegirl and feminist. She first came to prominence in 2017 when she created the hashtag #SaggyBoobsMatter on Twitter in order to promote the body-positive message that women\u2019s breasts and bodies are fine just as they are. It\u2019s an important idea and antithetical to a beauty industry that berates us for our imperfections. A year later Eggerue published a self-help motivational book, <em>What a Time to Be Alone: The Slumflower\u2019s Guide to Why You Are Already Enough</em>, which entered the Sunday Times bestseller list the week it was published in 2018, when she was 23. In her very pink, zanily illustrated book, Eggerue, a self-styled \u201cguru, confidante and best friend\u201d to her readers, offers advice on self-worth and self-acceptance. An earlier booklet called <em>Little Black Book: A Toolkit for Working Women</em>, by Otegha Uwagba, became a bestseller in 2016, paving the way for Eggerue. This, in turn, was probably influenced by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie\u2019s 2014 essay <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/17/chimamanda-ngozi-adichie-extract-we-should-all-be-feminists\" title=\"\">We Should All Be Feminists</a></em>. </p> <p>These are unprecedented times for black female writers, in no small part due to the internet. It has reconfigured how we present ourselves to the world at large, as well as bringing previously marginalised social groups and writing to the fore in ways hitherto unimaginable. As a society we are beginning to recognise and take seriously the ills and pitfalls of social media, but it is still the most exciting channel of mass communication since history began. </p> <p>And these times really are extraordinary. The ripple effects of 2013\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/19/blacklivesmatter-birth-civil-rights-movement\" title=\"\">#BlackLivesMatter</a> moment, and the movement that followed, saw renewed interest in writings about race in the US, which spilled over into the UK. We are used to the spotlight on racism being beamed across the Atlantic while little attention is paid to the perniciousness of systemic racism in Britain, about which there is much denial. Yet when #BlackLivesMatter gained momentum, it precipitated an unprecedented interest in non-fiction books by black writers. In 2016, David Olusoga published <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/nov/17/black-and-british-by-david-olusoga-review\" title=\"\">Black and British: A Forgotten History</a></em>, which accompanied an acclaimed television series and reached beyond the usual niche market for such books. Reni Eddo-Lodge\u2019s bestselling <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/30/why-im-no-longer-talking-to-white-people-about-race\" title=\"\">Why I\u2019m No Longer Talking to White People About Race</a> </em>(which began as a blog post which went viral) was published in 2017. However, while Eddo-Lodge acknowledges African American feminists of yore, she is silent on our own trailblazers. In 1985, <em>The Heart of the Race: Black Women\u2019s Lives in Britain</em>, edited by Beverley Bryan, Stella Dadzie and Suzanne Scafe, recently reissued, was one of the first non-fiction books that investigated the subject. Heidi Safia Mirza later published <em>Young, Female and Black</em> (1992) and <em>Black British Feminism</em> (1997). Much of this history has been lost: it is rarely taught at universities, nor does it appear in the timelines of what is effectively a whitewashed British feminist history.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"daf778c7f194ae309dac3005e3c7be7dc9e5aaae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/daf778c7f194ae309dac3005e3c7be7dc9e5aaae/0_249_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Yomi Adegoke and Elizabeth Uviebinen\u00e9 offer advice on how to get ahead.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yomi Adegoke, left, and Elizabeth Uviebinen\u00e9.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But all of these recent commercially and critically successful non-fiction books have sent the publishing industry into an unprecedented buying frenzy.

Burnett\u2019s deeply poetic communion with nature reminds me of Ingrid Pollard\u2019s 1988 Pastoral Interlude series of photographs, which captured, radically, and in a way that was ahead of its time, solitary black figures in the English countryside. Similarly, the play <em>Black Men Walking</em>, written by Testament, featured three northern black men who go on walking trips in the wilds of the Peak District \u2013 and talk. Seeing black British people, especially men, extracted from their usual depiction in an urban environment makes you realise how limiting that portrayal has been, how black life has become synonymous with the metropolis. <em>Black Men Walking</em> was a refreshing, progressive look at male friendship in a pastoral setting, while Burnett\u2019s memoir connects us at a primal, immersive level to the topography of a country that is as much ours as anyone else\u2019s.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d87d08e0d76dc7f8d2a5278e0e9a606d94fa57c4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d87d08e0d76dc7f8d2a5278e0e9a606d94fa57c4/0_254_4344_2607/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Changing landscapes \u2026 Black Men Walking by Testament.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Changing landscapes \u2026 Black Men Walking by Testament.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Also off the beaten track is <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/may/30/afropean-by-johny-pitts-review\" title=\"\">Afropean: Notes from Black Europe </a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/may/30/afropean-by-johny-pitts-review\" title=\"\">(2019)</a> by Johny Pitts, whose travels and encounters with black communities offer a counter-narrative to a continent associated with whiteness.

But whereas Phillips\u2019s book is a moving account of the experiences of a black man observing an overwhelming European whiteness more than 30 years ago, Pitts shows us today\u2019s black communities on the continent, and reframes our understanding of it. The books are companion pieces, as well as lessons in history, travel and identity. I ventured on to this terrain in my 2005 novel-with-verse <em>Soul Tourists</em>, creating a fictional black couple who travel across Europe by car to the Middle East in the late 1980s, a journey I myself had undertaken.

While there was a literary lineage of black writers in Britain going back to the 1950s and earlier, they were predominantly male and first-generation. In 80s Britain, the Women\u2019s Press imported the successful books of Alice Walker from the US, but with a couple of exceptions, such as the two novels of Joan Riley, was not interested in black British women\u2019s writing. And while Virago championed Maya Angelou, her homegrown counterparts were mostly absent from their lists.</p> <p>I remember disappearing between the pages of <em>Home Girls: A Black Feminist Anthology</em> (1999), edited by Barbara Smith, during one long weekend and discovering African American female writers who had the confidence and experience to express their realities through poetry and essays. The fragmentary prose-poetry books of the Jamaican-American author, Michelle Cliff, such as <em>Claiming an Identity They Taught Me to Despise</em> (1980), inspired me to be adventurous with my own writing. In her essay \u201cCaliban\u2019s Daughter\u201d (1991), Cliff wrote that her aim was \u201cto reject speechlessness, a process which has taken years, and to invent my own peculiar speech with which to describe my own peculiar self, to draw together everything I am and have been\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bda21b563c183310ca44250c2bf506a869e97c25\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bda21b563c183310ca44250c2bf506a869e97c25/0_63_3817_2291/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Audre Lord \u2026 she inspired a generation of feminists.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Audre Lord \u2026 she inspired a generation of feminists.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Alexander/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Similarly, Audre Lorde wrote in <em>Sister Outsider </em>(1984): \u201cWhat are the words you do not yet have? What do you need to say? What are the tyrannies you swallow day by day and attempt to make your own, until you will sicken of them and die of them, still in silence.\u201d She inspired my generation of feminists, much as she now inspires the latest generation, with new editions of her works. I met her when she visited London in the early 80s. She wanted to spend time with young black feminists. At an event at the Drill Hall theatre, with an audience of mostly white women, she demanded that the black women without tickets in the lobby be let in, or she wouldn\u2019t take to the stage.</p> <p>And how enriching and motivating it was to read interviews with so many great writers in <em>Black Women Writers at Work</em> (1984) edited by Claudia Tate. These African American women spoke of their process and practice long before you could trawl through online interviews and find authors doing the same. I am indebted to the female writers who went before me, whose pamphlets and books shaped me in my formative years and have travelled with me to my many homes over the decades; works that are stained with tobacco smoke, coffee and red wine from the days when I indulged in all three, and, while I have dispensed with thousands of books in my time, these and others from that era I treasure \u2013 they still reside on my bookshelves, grouped together to remind me that they were the making of me.</p> <p>We British female writers were emboldened and encouraged by their literature as we began to produce our own. Anthologies were a good way to start to showcase our burgeoning talents and to give us the confidence that comes with publication. There were several anthologies, such as <em>Black Women Talk Poetry</em> (1987), which featured 20 poets, including Jackie Kay, Dorothea Smartt and Adjoa Andoh, published by the newly formed Black Women Talk Poetry Collective of Da Choong, Olivette Cole-Wilson, Gabriela Pearse and myself; and <em>Watchers and Seekers</em> (1987), a mixture of poetry and fiction, edited by Rhonda Cobham and Merle Collins.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>Like today's art activists, black female writers were\u00a0doing it for themselves, rather than hoping to be cherry-picked by white Britain's cultural producers</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In creating an alternative space for our politicised creativity, we were challenging the status quo. We were too often excluded from white feminist endeavours, just as we were excluded or marginalised from much of the contemporaneous black male arts production. Many of us were queer, either transiently, as it turned out, or for life. This meant that we were more likely to organise as women together, and less reliant on male opinion and approval. Like today\u2019s young arts activists, we were doing it for ourselves rather than hoping to be cherry-picked by this country\u2019s white cultural producers.</p> <p>We never imagined that we would be taken as seriously as we are at this moment. I was thrilled to win the Booker prize earlier this week, just as I was overjoyed when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/dec/06/turner-prize-winner-lubaina-himid-interview\" title=\"\">Lubaina Himid</a> won the Turner prize in 2017 for her exciting, innovative and spectacular work, four decades after she began her career as an artist. Similarly, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/mar/30/richard-ii-my-friend-adjoa-andoh-was-born-to-play-the-king\" title=\"\">Adjoa Andoh</a> recently co-directed and starred in the first all-women-of-colour Shakespeare production on a major stage in Britain, <em>Richard II</em> at the Globe.</p> <p>I wonder what my generation might have achieved had social media been around when we were in our 20s. How would our lives have been enriched by the rapid interconnectivity of today? Many of us have campaigned to improve access to publishing and the arts industry for people of colour for decades, and we are finally seeing the results. I founded The Complete Works poetry mentoring scheme (2007\u201317), which selected 30 poets to be mentored by many of Britain\u2019s leading poets in order to redress the fact that less than 1% of poetry books published in the UK were by poets of colour. Now that proportion stands at 16% and the mentored poets are winning many top poetry and literature awards.</p> <p>One thing I have learned is that the future won\u2019t look after itself. We cannot take any developments for granted. If those of us who are considered marginal stop campaigning, we experience social regression. I wonder what will happen if the support systems, networks and development programmes for people of colour cease to exist. The plethora of books currently being published is astonishing, but we must be wary because today\u2019s boom is not the result of a steady, incremental transition. It has exploded out of a void.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a67b35796c66869ac271f4721d591db95b9000e0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a67b35796c66869ac271f4721d591db95b9000e0/0_1416_3648_2189/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chidera Eggerue, AKA The Slumflower.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chidera Eggerue, AKA The Slumflower.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rachel Sherlock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Where are its foundations? I have written in the past about fads in the literary world for writers of colour, especially the period in the mid-to-late 90s when there were more young black men and women publishing fiction than ever before, with a tendency towards coming-of-age narratives. By the noughties most of these writers had disappeared. </p> <p>What happens when the big advances do not deliver on their promise? What happens when second-book syndrome kicks in? What about those who have become authors almost by accident, via blogs leading to instant book deals? We want the field of writing to be wide and abundant, spanning the very young through to the very old. We want our writers to have long careers spent producing work that matures as they do. Yet the emphasis in publishing and the media focuses on the new and the young, although new and young isn\u2019t synonymous with fresh and original. Some of these writers become shooting stars, and when their moment has passed we wonder what happened to them. History tells us that books can too easily disappear from literary and cultural memory, until such time as they are rediscovered, if at all. Alice Walker resurrected the once-celebrated Zora Neale Hurston in 1975, 15 years after her death. Hurston\u2019s books had been out of print for decades. Obscurity has been the fate of too many black female writers.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/oct/15/booker-winners-bernardine-evaristo-margaret-atwood-rule-breaking\">Booker winners Bernardine Evaristo and Margaret Atwood on breaking the rules</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What is the role of books in our brave new world where knee-jerk reactions predominate, moral outrage is the prevailing orthodoxy and ideas must be compressed to sound bites? Chidera Eggerue, with a hefty 244,000-plus Instagram followers and 79,000-plus on Twitter, sagely advises: \u201cInstagram might shut down one day and suddenly nobody will care about your 80,000 followers. Relevance in the offline world is key.\u201d Conversely, the older writers, artists and activists who eschew social media are missing out on bringing their wisdom, experience and perspective to these debates. It\u2019s an exciting political, intellectual and creative space, and we need to be a part of it \u2013 and if not, we must ask ourselves if we are relinquishing our responsibility towards the future.</p> <p>Eggerue, and other arts activists of her generation, are benefiting from the desire of the multinationals to be aligned with woke young people and to exploit their marketability. The revolution, or rather what we might think of as this countercultural moment where those previously without a platform are having their say, has already been commodified. Those of us who are alert to the capriciousness of this <em>should</em> trumpet a note of caution to those who are swept up in the glamour of the moment. We need to ask ourselves how best we can effect change for our constituencies that is sustainable rather than fashionable. My answer is that the spirit of entrepreneurship, community and arts activism will sustain us long after it\u2019s no longer woke to be \u201cwoke\u201d.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Brave New Words: The Power of Writing Now, edited by Susheila Nasta, is <a href=\"https://www.bl.uk/events/island-full-of-voices-35-years-of-wasafiri\" title=\"\">published by Myriad, to celebrate 35 years of Wasafiri magazine.</a> </em><em>Evaristo will speak at </em><em><a href=\"https://www.bl.uk/events\" title=\"\">An Island Full of Voices: Writing Britain Now</a></em><em>, at the British Library, London NW1, on 9 November.</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Chidera Eggerue, AKA The Slumflower, is a social media star, south-east London homegirl and feminist. She first came to prominence in 2017 when she created the hashtag #SaggyBoobsMatter on Twitter in order to promote the body-positive message that women\u2019s breasts and bodies are fine just as they are. It\u2019s an important idea and antithetical to a beauty industry that berates us for our imperfections. A year later Eggerue published a self-help motivational book, What a Time to Be Alone: The Slumflower\u2019s Guide to Why You Are Already Enough, which entered the Sunday Times bestseller list the week it was published in 2018, when she was 23. In her very pink, zanily illustrated book, Eggerue, a self-styled \u201cguru, confidante and best friend\u201d to her readers, offers advice on self-worth and self-acceptance. An earlier booklet called Little Black Book: A Toolkit for Working Women, by Otegha Uwagba, became a bestseller in 2016, paving the way for Eggerue. This, in turn, was probably influenced by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie\u2019s 2014 essay We Should All Be Feminists. These are unprecedented times for black female writers, in no small part due to the internet. It has reconfigured how we present ourselves to the world at large, as well as bringing previously marginalised social groups and writing to the fore in ways hitherto unimaginable. As a society we are beginning to recognise and take seriously the ills and pitfalls of social media, but it is still the most exciting channel of mass communication since history began. And these times really are extraordinary. The ripple effects of 2013\u2019s #BlackLivesMatter moment, and the movement that followed, saw renewed interest in writings about race in the US, which spilled over into the UK. We are used to the spotlight on racism being beamed across the Atlantic while little attention is paid to the perniciousness of systemic racism in Britain, about which there is much denial. Yet when #BlackLivesMatter gained momentum, it precipitated an unprecedented interest in non-fiction books by black writers. In 2016, David Olusoga published Black and British: A Forgotten History, which accompanied an acclaimed television series and reached beyond the usual niche market for such books. Reni Eddo-Lodge\u2019s bestselling Why I\u2019m No Longer Talking to White People About Race (which began as a blog post which went viral) was published in 2017.

Also published this year was Safe: Black British Men Reclaiming Space, edited by Derek Owusu, co-host of the popular black-focused literature podcast, Mostly Lit. In Black, Listed, Jeffrey Boakye offered a witty and hard-hitting take on black British culture with a quirky dictionary of terms, while No Win Race by Derek Bardowell examined sport and race, family and legacy, spanning three decades from the Brixton riots of 1981 to the EU referendum.

At an event at the Drill Hall theatre, with an audience of mostly white women, she demanded that the black women without tickets in the lobby be let in, or she wouldn\u2019t take to the stage. And how enriching and motivating it was to read interviews with so many great writers in Black Women Writers at Work (1984) edited by Claudia Tate. These African American women spoke of their process and practice long before you could trawl through online interviews and find authors doing the same. I am indebted to the female writers who went before me, whose pamphlets and books shaped me in my formative years and have travelled with me to my many homes over the decades; works that are stained with tobacco smoke, coffee and red wine from the days when I indulged in all three, and, while I have dispensed with thousands of books in my time, these and others from that era I treasure \u2013 they still reside on my bookshelves, grouped together to remind me that they were the making of me. We British female writers were emboldened and encouraged by their literature as we began to produce our own. Anthologies were a good way to start to showcase our burgeoning talents and to give us the confidence that comes with publication. There were several anthologies, such as Black Women Talk Poetry (1987), which featured 20 poets, including Jackie Kay, Dorothea Smartt and Adjoa Andoh, published by the newly formed Black Women Talk Poetry Collective of Da Choong, Olivette Cole-Wilson, Gabriela Pearse and myself; and Watchers and Seekers (1987), a mixture of poetry and fiction, edited by Rhonda Cobham and Merle Collins. In creating an alternative space for our politicised creativity, we were challenging the status quo. We were too often excluded from white feminist endeavours, just as we were excluded or marginalised from much of the contemporaneous black male arts production. Many of us were queer, either transiently, as it turned out, or for life. This meant that we were more likely to organise as women together, and less reliant on male opinion and approval. Like today\u2019s young arts activists, we were doing it for ourselves rather than hoping to be cherry-picked by this country\u2019s white cultural producers. We never imagined that we would be taken as seriously as we are at this moment. I was thrilled to win the Booker prize earlier this week, just as I was overjoyed when Lubaina Himid won the Turner prize in 2017 for her exciting, innovative and spectacular work, four decades after she began her career as an artist. Similarly, Adjoa Andoh recently co-directed and starred in the first all-women-of-colour Shakespeare production on a major stage in Britain, Richard II at the Globe. I wonder what my generation might have achieved had social media been around when we were in our 20s. How would our lives have been enriched by the rapid interconnectivity of today? Many of us have campaigned to improve access to publishing and the arts industry for people of colour for decades, and we are finally seeing the results. I founded The Complete Works poetry mentoring scheme (2007\u201317), which selected 30 poets to be mentored by many of Britain\u2019s leading poets in order to redress the fact that less than 1% of poetry books published in the UK were by poets of colour. Now that proportion stands at 16% and the mentored poets are winning many top poetry and literature awards. One thing I have learned is that the future won\u2019t look after itself. We cannot take any developments for granted. If those of us who are considered marginal stop campaigning, we experience social regression. I wonder what will happen if the support systems, networks and development programmes for people of colour cease to exist. The plethora of books currently being published is astonishing, but we must be wary because today\u2019s boom is not the result of a steady, incremental transition. It has exploded out of a void. Where are its foundations? I have written in the past about fads in the literary world for writers of colour, especially the period in the mid-to-late 90s when there were more young black men and women publishing fiction than ever before, with a tendency towards coming-of-age narratives. By the noughties most of these writers had disappeared. What happens when the big advances do not deliver on their promise? What happens when second-book syndrome kicks in? What about those who have become authors almost by accident, via blogs leading to instant book deals? We want the field of writing to be wide and abundant, spanning the very young through to the very old. We want our writers to have long careers spent producing work that matures as they do. Yet the emphasis in publishing and the media focuses on the new and the young, although new and young isn\u2019t synonymous with fresh and original. Some of these writers become shooting stars, and when their moment has passed we wonder what happened to them. History tells us that books can too easily disappear from literary and cultural memory, until such time as they are rediscovered, if at all. Alice Walker resurrected the once-celebrated Zora Neale Hurston in 1975, 15 years after her death. Hurston\u2019s books had been out of print for decades. Obscurity has been the fate of too many black female writers. What is the role of books in our brave new world where knee-jerk reactions predominate, moral outrage is the prevailing orthodoxy and ideas must be compressed to sound bites? Chidera Eggerue, with a hefty 244,000-plus Instagram followers and 79,000-plus on Twitter, sagely advises: \u201cInstagram might shut down one day and suddenly nobody will care about your 80,000 followers. Relevance in the offline world is key.\u201d Conversely, the older writers, artists and activists who eschew social media are missing out on bringing their wisdom, experience and perspective to these debates. It\u2019s an exciting political, intellectual and creative space, and we need to be a part of it \u2013 and if not, we must ask ourselves if we are relinquishing our responsibility towards the future. Eggerue, and other arts activists of her generation, are benefiting from the desire of the multinationals to be aligned with woke young people and to exploit their marketability. The revolution, or rather what we might think of as this countercultural moment where those previously without a platform are having their say, has already been commodified. Those of us who are alert to the capriciousness of this should trumpet a note of caution to those who are swept up in the glamour of the moment. We need to ask ourselves how best we can effect change for our constituencies that is sustainable rather than fashionable. My answer is that the spirit of entrepreneurship, community and arts activism will sustain us long after it\u2019s no longer woke to be \u201cwoke\u201d. \u2022 Brave New Words: The Power of Writing Now, edited by Susheila Nasta, is published by Myriad, to celebrate 35 years of Wasafiri magazine.

I asked my wife, and she immediately said no. She is happy to game with the kids, but as soon as she heard there might be a photo in the Guardian, she made it very clear that she was out. My mother, on the other hand, was keen as mustard before I had even explained what we were going to do. This implies that she was desperate to get into the paper, but the truth is, my mum is perpetually frustrated at how little she sees us; this was more of an opportunity to spend some time with the grandkids.</p> <p>It also occurred to me that my mum being able to play Fortnite might be the best thing ever for her relationship with the boys. They currently see her as the loud woman who kisses them way too much when she turns up at their house. Most of their time with her is spent doing that cartoon-eyeballs-popping-out thing while my mum hugs the life out of them. It might be beneficial for them to see her as a Fortnite player. Additionally, it would be nice for me to have somebody present whom I can definitely beat.</p> <p>My mum saw my brother and me grow up with computer games, and has always been bemused by how much we love them. Occasionally, she has expressed distaste for what\u2019s being played (she finds beat-\u2019em-ups to be a damning indictment of human nature), so I wondered how she was going to take to a game that required you to drop on to an island and kill absolutely everybody else there until you are the last person standing, in what many have dubbed the \u201cpost-Brexit simulator\u201d. </p> <p>The day of the training arrives. Daniel has set up three screens, and the boys start playing immediately, admiring the \u201cskins\u201d Daniel has chosen (this is your onscreen avatar, which could be anything from a robot sentinel to a skirting-pretty-close-to-licensing laws version of <a href=\"https://strangerthings.fandom.com/wiki/Jim_Hopper\" title=\"\">Chief Hopper </a>from Stranger Things). While the boys play, Mum and I receive our basic training before preparing to fight it out as a family.</p> <p>Mum goes first. Daniel begins by setting us up in an empty, onscreen environment so we can familiarise ourselves with the game. As well as running around and picking up weapons, we have to look out for rejuvenating potions; we can also build things to hide behind, which is apparently the skill that distinguishes the really great players. I understand that games are not rooted in reality, but the idea that you would knock up a fence while being shot at feels like something you wouldn\u2019t even suggest at a development meeting, let alone allow as a big part of the game. Having said that, my son is playing as a banana, so I might be judging this by the wrong criteria.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Mum\u2019s inexperience means everything she does is celebrated: shoot someone, applause! Walk out of a room, applause!</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Daniel watches Mum for a little bit and then adjusts his tasks accordingly. Instead of showing us how to use various weapons and execute some cool kills, he very quickly ascertains that he is going to have to scaffold the learning a bit. He asks my mum to try something simple \u2013 walking into a house. That takes half an hour. You use the right-hand stick to control where you are looking, and the left-hand stick to control where you are walking. Mum spends most of that half an hour walking into a wall while looking up at the sky. I start telling her what to do, and she asks me how come I am already so good at this; I realise that her problem is that she has no experience of gaming at all. By dint of simply having played a game, any game, I am able to move around with no problem.</p> <p>It is both a relief to know she is that crap, and incredibly frustrating to watch. I keep saying things such as, \u201cOh my God, Mum, are you serious?\u201d as she once again fails to walk through a door. Again and again she imprisons herself in a room, completely unable to leave, putting me and the boys into hysterics.</p> <p>But then the boys do something wonderful. With Daniel\u2019s help, they realise that they are going to have to help their grandmother pick up the basics. So they join the game and start leaving various weapons and potions around where she is playing, giving her little tests in how to pick things up and access them. They talk her through what to do, and congratulate her when she manages it. She is loving it. They start positioning themselves in places and asking her to try to shoot them. They don\u2019t even mind when she asks them to get closer and then, as she tries to shoot, looks up at the sky hundreds of times. I am actually impressed.</p> <p>Then it is my turn for training, and I have to confess that here I am slightly envious of my mum. While Daniel is brilliant, my mum\u2019s inexperience means that absolutely everything she does leads to a family celebration: shoot someone, applause! Walk out of a room, applause! Manage to spend 30 seconds without looking up at the sky, applause! While the boys remain supportive, I receive no accolades for my efforts; they already expect me to be a certain standard. I am beginning to regret bringing Mum. This woman will be declared a champion simply for managing to walk out of a room.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9236e825576618577018064485cab59888de10a5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9236e825576618577018064485cab59888de10a5/0_2198_3747_2552/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Romesh Ranganathan, his mother Shanthi and son Theo, sitting on a sofa, gaming\" width=\"1000\" height=\"681\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It is Theo v Mum v me. Mum and I play on out of sheer pride.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Yeo/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Daniel explains that I am justified in finding Fortnite hard. It is a notoriously difficult game to get to grips with, particularly because you have to start playing against other online players, who are already brilliant at it. Your early experiences are mainly getting killed almost immediately, and then waiting for another game to start. It\u2019s a hurdle that Fortnite\u2019s makers have addressed, somewhat controversially, by introducing game-controlled bots, which aren\u2019t as good as real-life players. The idea is that you can practise against those, rather than be murdered by a group of kids who have spent 10 hours a day playing from their mum\u2019s basement for the last six months. (The other thing Fortnite\u2019s makers did, last weekend, was replace the whole game with a black hole, before unveiling Chapter 2 and a rebooted world two days later. Which means we might need to train all over again.)</p> <p>Our family session completed, the tournament begins. The idea is simple: whoever first completes a kill will be declared the winner. Daniel has set up a \u201crumble\u201d, so that if you are killed you will simply reappear and keep going, with that death going against your team\u2019s score. It is my eldest son, Theo, v Mum v me. Theo immediately bags himself a kill and is declared victorious, but Mum and I play on out of sheer pride. I have everything on the line here; a defeat will be unrecoverable in terms of gaining any kind of respect. I will have no choice but to offer the kids the opportunity to request a new father, one who can assemble Nintendo Labo structures, and move on to a new life.</p> <p>Fortunately, the online players of Fortnite prove my saviours. They are all very good, so it quickly becomes obvious that neither Mum nor I is going to have any chance of killing them. Every time either of us approach anything like a scrap, we are dispatched immediately. One particular player identifies me as a weak link and keeps seeking me out to kill me again. This is not my proudest moment.</p> <p>Daniel says he is willing to wait in the studio until one of us gets a kill, but it feels slightly unfair to keep him here for a month. So Theo is declared the winner, and Mum and I hug as worthy losers, before she is once again applauded for having given it a go.</p> <p>Has my training turned me into the expert I hoped I could be? Certainly not. But it has given us some quality family time, the sort I might previously have assumed was possible only through the medium of board games or days out. The boys enjoyed teaching us about \u201ctheir\u201d game. And I have been reminded of how hilarious it is when your parents are irretrievably rubbish at something. We have all agreed to have another go sometime.

You use the right-hand stick to control where you are looking, and the left-hand stick to control where you are walking. Mum spends most of that half an hour walking into a wall while looking up at the sky. I start telling her what to do, and she asks me how come I am already so good at this; I realise that her problem is that she has no experience of gaming at all. By dint of simply having played a game, any game, I am able to move around with no problem. It is both a relief to know she is that crap, and incredibly frustrating to watch. I keep saying things such as, \u201cOh my God, Mum, are you serious?\u201d as she once again fails to walk through a door. Again and again she imprisons herself in a room, completely unable to leave, putting me and the boys into hysterics. But then the boys do something wonderful. With Daniel\u2019s help, they realise that they are going to have to help their grandmother pick up the basics. So they join the game and start leaving various weapons and potions around where she is playing, giving her little tests in how to pick things up and access them. They talk her through what to do, and congratulate her when she manages it. She is loving it. They start positioning themselves in places and asking her to try to shoot them. They don\u2019t even mind when she asks them to get closer and then, as she tries to shoot, looks up at the sky hundreds of times. I am actually impressed. Then it is my turn for training, and I have to confess that here I am slightly envious of my mum. While Daniel is brilliant, my mum\u2019s inexperience means that absolutely everything she does leads to a family celebration: shoot someone, applause! Walk out of a room, applause! Manage to spend 30 seconds without looking up at the sky, applause! While the boys remain supportive, I receive no accolades for my efforts; they already expect me to be a certain standard. I am beginning to regret bringing Mum. This woman will be declared a champion simply for managing to walk out of a room. Daniel explains that I am justified in finding Fortnite hard. It is a notoriously difficult game to get to grips with, particularly because you have to start playing against other online players, who are already brilliant at it. Your early experiences are mainly getting killed almost immediately, and then waiting for another game to start. It\u2019s a hurdle that Fortnite\u2019s makers have addressed, somewhat controversially, by introducing game-controlled bots, which aren\u2019t as good as real-life players. The idea is that you can practise against those, rather than be murdered by a group of kids who have spent 10 hours a day playing from their mum\u2019s basement for the last six months. (The other thing Fortnite\u2019s makers did, last weekend, was replace the whole game with a black hole, before unveiling Chapter 2 and a rebooted world two days later. Which means we might need to train all over again.) Our family session completed, the tournament begins. The idea is simple: whoever first completes a kill will be declared the winner. Daniel has set up a \u201crumble\u201d, so that if you are killed you will simply reappear and keep going, with that death going against your team\u2019s score. It is my eldest son, Theo, v Mum v me. Theo immediately bags himself a kill and is declared victorious, but Mum and I play on out of sheer pride. I have everything on the line here; a defeat will be unrecoverable in terms of gaining any kind of respect. I will have no choice but to offer the kids the opportunity to request a new father, one who can assemble Nintendo Labo structures, and move on to a new life. Fortunately, the online players of Fortnite prove my saviours. They are all very good, so it quickly becomes obvious that neither Mum nor I is going to have any chance of killing them. Every time either of us approach anything like a scrap, we are dispatched immediately. One particular player identifies me as a weak link and keeps seeking me out to kill me again. This is not my proudest moment. Daniel says he is willing to wait in the studio until one of us gets a kill, but it feels slightly unfair to keep him here for a month. So Theo is declared the winner, and Mum and I hug as worthy losers, before she is once again applauded for having given it a go. Has my training turned me into the expert I hoped I could be? Certainly not. But it has given us some quality family time, the sort I might previously have assumed was possible only through the medium of board games or days out. The boys enjoyed teaching us about \u201ctheir\u201d game. And I have been reminded of how hilarious it is when your parents are irretrievably rubbish at something. We have all agreed to have another go sometime. As long as there are no photographers involved, my wife might even join us.

There\u2019s a modicum of substance here, as the film essentially works as a breezy introduction to the 2016 Panama Papers scandal, filtering that complex tangle of offshore financial chaos through the smaller story of Ellen Martin (Streep), a dithery, bucket-hatted pensioner pulling away at a seemingly minor insurance-fraud case \u2013 a thread that turns out to unravel the entire bobbly jumper. Streep, who can score Oscar nominations merely for breathing within earshot of a camera, is on broad, sprightly form. She\u2019s not especially tested here, but she makes The Laundromat a romp, and gives it a softer, sweeter heart than otherwise comparable economic crisis films such as The Big Short. Back around the time of Erin Brockovich, Soderbergh gave procedurals like this righteous cinematic welly; here, he has practically accepted that he\u2019s making a TV movie. It feels more at home in my living room than it did in a grand Venice screening hall. Dolemite Is My Name is similarly sparky without being especially ambitious, ticking off as it does a shopping list of showbiz biopic conventions in the story of Rudy Ray Moore. A failing African American comedian, Moore reversed his fortunes in the 1970s by adopting the persona of the obscene, motormouthed street pimp Dolemite, becoming an icon of blaxploitation cinema in the process \u2013 a clear inspiration to Eddie Murphy, who plays him with plainly adoring dedication, deftly channelling Moore\u2019s ribald comic energy through his own wild screen presence. Murphy never got talked up for awards when he was doing his own thing in comedy; it\u2019s only when he\u2019s pouring his spirit into a different kind of black performer, as in his Oscar-nominated turn as a self-destructive soul singer in Dreamgirls, that he suddenly gets that kind of respect. Which is to say that, electric as he often is in Dolemite Is My Name \u2013 a funny, fluorescently styled exercise that dotes generously on its star at some cost to its own cinematic inventiveness \u2013 it\u2019d be nice to see a film, half as carefully and devotedly made as this one, that just lets Eddie Murphy be Eddie Murphy. Can his own Netflix biopic be far off? Also new to streaming and DVD Support the Girls (Bulldog Films, 15) A wonderfully weathered performance by Regina Hall anchors Andrew Bujalski\u2019s observant, warmly communal comedy about the put-upon female staff of a Hooters-style \u201cbreastaurant\u201d. Transit (Curzon Artificial Eye, 15) German auteur Christian Petzold takes a bold conceptual risk with this modern-dress adaptation of Anna Seghers\u2019s 1944 Holocaust novel, powerfully transposing its concerns of identity and impermanence to the current refugee crisis. Toy Story 4 (Disney, U) If you thought Toy Story 3 brought the story to a neat and meaningful close, rendering any further sequels superfluous, you\u2019d be right. This is bright and cheery enough, and made a billion dollars worldwide, but that\u2019s the reason it exists.",

      "bodyText": "An Iraqi man has been charged in Australia with people-trafficking in connection with the drowning deaths of more than 350 asylum seekers in the 2001 SIEV X tragedy. Maythem Radhi, 43, was arrested at Brisbane airport late Friday after being extradited from New Zealand and has been charged with \u201corganising groups of non-citizens into Australia\u201d, police say. He faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted. The Australian federal police claims Radhi was a member of a people-smuggling syndicate that charged 421 mostly Iraqi and Afghan refugees for a place aboard an Indonesian fishing boat \u2013 designated by Australian authorities as Suspected Illegal Entry Vessel (SIEV) X \u2013 in October 2001. The vessel sank in international waters south of Java on October 19 while en route to Australia\u2019s Christmas Island, leaving 353 people dead, 146 of them children. Forty-four survivors were rescued the next day by an Indonesian fishing boat. A 45th survivor was rescued a further 12 hours later by another boat. Some of those on board SIEV X were trying to join family members already in Australia, but with whom they could not be reunited by plane because of visa restrictions. Radhi appeared before Brisbane magistrates court on Saturday and has been remanded in custody to reappear in court on 31 October. \u201cPolice will allege in court that the man, then aged 24, took payments from the passengers,\u201d the Australian federal police said in a statement on Saturday, 18 years after the disaster. \u201cIt will also be alleged that he helped facilitate the transportation and accommodation of people in Indonesia in preparation for their journey to Australia.\u201d Radhi is the third person to face court for their role in the disaster. Iraqi people-smuggler Khaleed Shnayf Daoed was extradited from Sweden to Australia in 2003 and received a nine-year sentence two years later, with prosecutors portraying the then 36-year-old as a key organiser for Egyptian people-smuggler Abu Quassey. Quassey was convicted in Egypt in December 2003 of causing death through negligence and was sentenced to seven years in prison. The AFP commissioner, Reece Kershaw, on Saturday said the AFP was committed to bringing people smugglers to justice no matter how long it might take. \u201cMore than 350 people died in this tragedy,\u201d Kershaw said. \u201cThey are owed justice and we remain committed to deterring those who profit from this trade.\u201d The SIEV-X tragedy remains a seismic event in shaping Australia\u2019s migration policies towards asylum seekers arriving by boat. The sinking occurred during the 2001 Australian federal election campaign and after the Tampa crisis had made boat arrivals a key, and deeply controversial, election issue. The incumbent Liberal prime minister, John Howard, had deployed the navy and AFP to prevent boats reaching Australian waters and international legal responsibility to rescue people from distressed vessels. A 2002 Senate inquiry into the children overboard affair, Tampa crisis and SIEV X found that, while there were several gaps in the chain of reporting of intelligence on boat arrivals, it could find no grounds for believing that negligence or dereliction of duty was committed in relation to SIEV X. \u201cThe committee, nevertheless, finds it disturbing that no review of the SIEV X episode was conducted by any agency in the aftermath of the tragedy. No such review occurred until after the committee\u2019s inquiry had started and public controversy developed over the Australian response to SIEV X,\u201d it said. \u201cWhile there were reasonable grounds to explain the Australian response to SIEV X, the committee finds it extraordinary that a major human disaster could occur in the vicinity of a theatre of intensive Australian operations, and remain undetected until three days after the event, without any concern being raised within intelligence and decision making circles.\u201d A memorial to the victims of SIEV X stands on the shores of Lake Burley Griffin in Canberra.",

Here is a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/publications/revised-withdrawal-agreement-including-protocol-ireland-and-northern-ireland_en\">link to the full text</a>.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>The backstop is replaced</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The backstop has essentially been replaced by a full stop whereby Northern Ireland remains aligned to the EU from the end of the transition period for at least four years. A change can only happen if it is voted on by the Stormont assembly.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Consent</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Stormont will have a key role in future Brexit arrangements. And if there is cross-community support to remain aligned to the EU rather than the UK the consent will hold for eight years.</p>\n    <p>The arrangements in this deal will automatically kick in for a mandated four years if there is a breakdown in trade talks, so it remains a \u201cbackstop\u201d but with a permanent tinge.</p>\n    <p>That four-year period will start at the end of December 2020.</p>\n    <p>Two months before the end of the four-year period, that is October 2024, Stormont will be asked to vote on whether to remain aligned to the EU in ways outlined by this deal or not.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Checks on border, ports and airports</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Under the deal, the UK and the EU are \u201cunderlining their firm commitment to no customs and regulatory checks or controls and related physical infrastructure at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland\u201d.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Future trade deals</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The EU and the UK will aim for a zero-tariff deal with unlimited quotas. The entire UK, including Northern Ireland, will be free to sign trade deals. The line in the political declaration that \u201cthe United Kingdom will consider aligning with union rules in relevant areas\u201d in any future trade talks has been ditched.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Customs</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Northern Ireland will remain legally in the UK customs territory but practically in the EU customs unions. There will therefore be no customs checks on the border but tariffs will be payable on certain commercial goods.</p>\n    <p>No customs duties will be payable on \u201cpersonal property\u201d being transited from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. That protects online shopping and all items bought for personal rather than commercial use.</p>\n    <p>Customs duties will be payable on goods imported from the UK for commercial use unless it can be demonstrated that the goods remain in Northern Ireland or are for personal use, as above.</p>\n    <p>A system of rebates will allow importers to be reimbursed.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>West/east trade</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The commitment to frictionless trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain is restated.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>VAT</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>EU law on VAT will apply in Northern Ireland.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Single electricity market</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The island of Ireland is considering a single market for electricity so homes in Northern Ireland can get their energy from a supplier in Northern Ireland or the republic. There were fears this could be disrupted by Brexit. Under the Johnson deal, the provisions of union law remain so nothing will change.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Level playing field</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>This guarantees that the UK will remain in line with EU conventions on climate, environment and workers rights in a future trade agreement.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/lisaocarroll\"><b>Lisa O'Carroll</b></a>&nbsp;<i>Brexit correspondent</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The cost of a number of the coaches has been covered by supporters including the TV chef Delia Smith, who is paying for transport from Norwich and Bury St Edmunds.

The shadow chancellor will give a speech at the Final Say rally in Parliament Square alongside the actor Sir Patrick Stewart and the co-presenter of The Great British Bake Off Sandi Toksvig. McDonnell is one of the highest-profile Labour figures to attend a rally organised by the People\u2019s Vote campaign so far and comes after he vowed to personally campaign for remain should there be another poll. But his attendance comes as Labour is believed to be cooling towards tabling a second referendum amendment of any kind to Johnson\u2019s emergency motion on the new Brexit deal.

The crowds have gone and although the intense heat has rescinded, the surrounding hills trap the summer temperatures, making it warm enough to sit out on a cafe terrace and watch the world go by.</p> <p>Make your first port of call the amphitheatre - <a href=\"https://www.arenes-nimes.com/\" title=\"\">Les Ar\u00e8nes</a> (entrance \u20ac13, including the other two Roman attractions mentioned below). Explore the interior corridors (<em>vomitories</em>), then climb to the top of the terraces to see the amphitheatre (133 metres long by 101 wide) in its full glory. The top tier also offers views of the surrounding hills (seven, just like Rome), including Mont Cavalier, the highest point of the city, on which the Roman Tour Magne, built by Augustus, stands sentinel.</p> <p>Opposite the amphitheatre, explore the <a href=\"https://museedelaromanite.fr/en/\" title=\"\">Mus\u00e9e de la Romanit\u00e9</a>, which opened in 2018 and holds a fascinating collection of artefacts, from large and exquisite mosaics to statues and glassware that survived 2,000 years buried in sarcophagi. There are interactive exhibits, too, which help bring the history to life. The museum\u2019s own architecture is also impressive \u2013 from its glass mosaic-tiled facade that represents the ripples of a toga, to the different levels within the museum that allow you to view the exhibits from above.</p> <p>Next stop should be N\u00eemes\u2019 old town: the warren of streets that runs north of the amphitheatre is punctuated with sunny squares, cafes and restaurants, along with independent boutiques for clothes, jewellery and homewares. Stop for lunch at <a href=\"http://www.restaurant-levintage-nimes.com/?lang=f\" title=\"\">Le Vintage</a>, where you can devour bistro classics on its pavement terrace. Skip dessert though, because the best ice-cream and patisserie in town is a few steps away at <a href=\"https://maison-villaret.com/\" title=\"\">Maison Villaret</a>, which was established in 1775. Try its speciality, <em>croquants</em> \u2013 delicate almond biscuits flavoured with orange water. N\u00eemes is also famous for another kind of biscuit, <em>caladons</em>, with almonds and honey.</p> <p>The old town opens out into a grand square where <a href=\"https://www.arenes-nimes.com/en/discovering-site/maison-carree\" title=\"\">La Maison Carr\u00e9</a>, the only surviving intact Roman temple in France, stands proud on a plinth with bright white pillars. Inside, there\u2019s a screening of the film Nemausus, the Founding of N\u00eemes.</p> <p>Nearby, the <a href=\"https://www.avignon-et-provence.com/en/parks-and-gardens/jardins-de-fontaine\" title=\"\">Jardins de la Fontaine</a> are the town\u2019s breathing space: these ornate baroque gardens feature terraces, statues and ornamental ponds, as well as the remains of the town\u2019s original water source, housed in the remains of the Temple de Diane. Up the hill behind it is the Tour Magne.</p> <p>For dinner, <a href=\"http://www.l-imprevu.com/\" title=\"\">L\u2019Impr\u00e9vu</a> serves seafood and Italian-inspired dishes and has a terrace on one of the city\u2019s liveliest squares, Place d\u2019Assas.</p> <p><strong>Example journey</strong> <br>Take the 09.24 from St Pancras, crossing Paris to Gare de Lyon for the 14.07 to Nimes, arriving at 17.05. Returning, the 07.58 gets to Paris Gare de Lyon at 10.53, then across Paris to Gare du Nord for the 12.13 to London, arriving at 13.30.</p> <p><strong>Stay</strong> <br>at cosy, beautifully decorated <a href=\"https://www.chambredhotesdecharmenimes.fr/en\" title=\"\">La Maison Rousseau B&amp;B</a> (doubles from \u20ac105pn). It\u2019s in a peaceful spot and an easy walk to the main sites. <br><strong>Carolyn Boyd</strong></p> <h2><strong>Angers</strong>,<strong> </strong>France</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"a96df5d4ae904679ad52c5f855a28ad368b77870\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a96df5d4ae904679ad52c5f855a28ad368b77870/0_369_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tapestries in the gallery of Apocalypse, Angers castel, Maine et Loire department, Pays de la Loire, France\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">L\u2019Apocalypse Tapestry (1375) in Angers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Fastest journey from London</strong> 5 hours via Lille<br><strong><a href=\"https://www.eurostar.com/uk-en/city-breaks\">Cheapest Nov fare with Eurostar</a></strong> \u00a395 return</p> <p>Though it isn\u2019t as well-known as other cities of the Loire, Angers makes the most of its unique position on the River Maine, just before it joins the Loire, with riverside restaurants and enchanting cycle trails, as well as art deco architecture, distilleries and an imposing chateau at the heart of the city.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.chateau-angers.fr/en\" title=\"\">Ch\u00e2teau d\u2019Angers</a> is a good place to start. This mighty fortress is surrounded by 17 towers which punctuate its mighty 2\u00bd-metre thick walls. For superb views of the city and river, walk around its ramparts, which enclose a tiny vineyard and gardens. Inside, the rooms and exhibits tell the story of the Dukes of Anjou who held court here in the 14th and 15th centuries and were great patrons of the arts. The main draw, however, is the 104-metre <a href=\"https://www.loirevalley-france.co.uk/loire-valley-chateaux/chateau-angers/not-be-missed-tapestry-apocalypse\" title=\"\">Tapestry of the Apocalypse</a> illustrating the Book of Revelations. It took seven years to complete in the late 14th century and its six-metre-high panels, which depict 90 scenes, are beautifully lit in an atmospheric gallery. The chateau\u2019s own restaurant serves good hearty dishes with mains from around \u20ac10.</p> <p>Outside the chateau, follow the blue line painted on the pavements to guide you around a loop of the best sights in the old town. Highlights include the beautiful medieval Cath\u00e9dral Saint-Maurice with its wonderful stained-glass windows. Just behind it is the six-storey, half-timbered Maison d\u2019Adam, built in 1491 and home to decorative carvings of bawdy figures. A chain department store wouldn\u2019t usually star in a city\u2019s list of must-sees, but the elegant facade and art deco glass roof of <a href=\"https://www.galerieslafayette.com/\" title=\"\">Galeries Lafayette</a> will delight fans of fine design. For more art deco, keep following the blue line to <a href=\"http://www.architecture-art-deco.fr/la-maison-bleue-a-angers.html\" title=\"\">La Maison Bleue</a>, an apartment building built in 1929 and decorated with colourful mosaics and ornate ironwork.</p> <p>Autumn is the ideal time to pedal along the Loire \u00e0 V\u00e9lo cycling track, which follows the famous river. Hire bikes at <a href=\"http://www.location-velo.fr/tarifs.html\" title=\"\">Vert Event Angers</a> (from \u20ac15 a day) and cycle 8km down to the attractive village of Bouchemaine, where <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Le-Noe-Bouchemaine/127995680609190\" title=\"\">Le No\u00e9</a> is one of the region\u2019s many <em>guinguettes</em> \u2013 riverside cafe-bistros that offer a host of entertainment, music and activities.</p> <p>Three kilometres to the east, just outside peaceful Sainte-Gemmes-sur-Loire village, is another hub of activity at <a href=\"http://guinguettedeportthibault.fr/\" title=\"\">Guinguette de Port-Thibaut</a>, with superb views over the broad river. Further down the Loire, a 30-minute cycle away, is the \u00cele B\u00e9huard \u2013 an island with monastery and historic chapel at the heart of the characterful village.</p> <p>Angers is the home of Cointreau: the orange liqueur was created here in 1875 and visitors can tour the <a href=\"https://www.cointreau.com/fr/fr/carre-cointreau\" title=\"\">distillery</a>. On the other side of town, <a href=\"http://www.giffard.com/en/lespace-menthe-pastille/\" title=\"\">Distillerie Giffard</a> also has a visitor centre, with a range of liqueurs, including the Menthe-Pastille that made its name.</p> <p><br><strong>Example journey</strong> <br>Though most Eurostar journeys go via Paris, it is easier to go via Lille as there is a direct train from there to Angers. It also means you only have to cross the platform to change, rather than crossing Paris from Gard du Nord to Gare Montparnasse, and only one change. Take the 15.04 from London St Pancras, then the 17.52 from Lille. Returning, take the 12.41 to Lille, then the 17.35 back to London. <br></p> <p><strong>Stay</strong> <br><a href=\"https://www.21foch.fr/\" title=\"\">Hotel 21 Foch</a> (doubles from \u20ac89 room only) is a small, contemporary hotel in the city centre. <br><strong>CB</strong></p> <h2><strong>Biarritz</strong>,<strong> </strong>France</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"4bb3c7cbd605575ec98452938a1f06e75e94cf09\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4bb3c7cbd605575ec98452938a1f06e75e94cf09/0_105_3608_2165/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Surfers at Biarritz.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Surfers at Biarritz.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Fastest journey from London</strong> 7\u00bd hours via Paris (about an hour longer inbound)<br><strong><a href=\"https://www.eurostar.com/uk-en/train/france/london-to-biarritz\">Cheapest Nov fare with Eurostar</a></strong> \u00a3120 return</p> <p>For fresh sea air, fabulous food and Basque culture, a short break in Biarritz fits the bill even in the cooler months. Though its glorious golden beaches and surf culture may suggest it\u2019s a summer-only destination, there is plenty to draw you there in autumn.</p> <p>Try to time your visit with the <a href=\"https://tourisme.biarritz.fr/fr/actualites/fetes-de-la-saint-martin\" title=\"\">F\u00eate de la Saint Martin</a> (8-11 November) to see the town celebrate its Basque heritage through concerts, dance shows, workshops, food events and the Basque racket game, <em>pelota</em>.</p> <p>Foodies will love <a href=\"https://tourisme.biarritz.fr/fr/actualites/la-semaine-des-restaurants-0\" title=\"\">Restaurant Week</a> also in early November (4-10), when many of the town\u2019s restaurants showcase their best Basque dishes for \u20ac20 for lunch or \u20ac30 for dinner. Though you can embrace the French Basque country\u2019s piquant cuisine any time of year at <a href=\"https://halles-biarritz.fr/\" title=\"\">Les Halles market</a> \u2013 tuck into <em>pintxos</em> (Basque tapas) and sip local wine at the many stalls.</p> <p>For goodies to take home, explore the town\u2019s many chocolateries, such as <a href=\"https://www.paries.fr/\" title=\"\">Pari\u00e8s</a> or <a href=\"https://www.maisonadam.fr/\" title=\"\">Maison Adam</a>, and Rue Victor Hugo, home to the ultimate cheese shop, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/1001fromages/\" title=\"\">1001 Fromages</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.arosteguy.com/\" title=\"\">Maison Arost\u00e9guy</a> <em>\u00e9picerie</em>, which is rammed to the rafters with fantastic Basque and French products.</p> <p>The other streets that surround the market are great for restaurants, as is Rue Gambetta, leading south from the market. Elsewhere, one of the best tables in town is <a href=\"http://lepimpi-bistrot.com/\" title=\"\">Le Pimpi Bistrot </a>on Avenue de Verdun, where chef Manu Michel\u2019s dishes showcase the seafood, fish and charcuterie that the Basque country does so well, while nearby locals\u2019 favourite <a href=\"https://m.facebook.com/La-Tantina-De-Burgos-126582804024308/\" title=\"\">Tantina de Burgos</a> on Place Beau Rivage serves excellent dishes flavoured with the local chilli pepper, <em>piment d\u2019espelette</em>.</p> <p>Autumn sees the mighty Atlantic waves roll ever more fiercely to shore, and if you dare take to the water there are several surf schools (try <a href=\"https://www.hastea.com/en/\" title=\"\">hastea.com</a>, 90-minute group lessons from \u20ac40) to hire you a board, wetsuit and the guidance of an instructor. A more indulgent way to enjoy the sea, though, is with a thalassotherapy session \u2013 seawater therapy \u2013 which will blast, drench or sprinkle you with seawater in a variety of treatments said to help circulation and skin tone. Try it at the <a href=\"https://sofitel.accorhotels.com/gb/destinations/thalassotherapy-in-biarritz-biarritz.shtml\" title=\"\">Sofitel</a> (treatments from \u20ac45).</p> <p>Or to enjoy the ocean without getting wet, take a coastal walk from the lighthouse along the Grande Plage, through the cluster of fisherman\u2019s cabins at Port des P\u00eacheurs, and on to Le Rocher de la Vierge \u2013 a rock formation topped with a Virgin Mary statue, on the site of a miracle. Then follow the road around to the small Plage de Port Vieux, and finish at the incredible C\u00f4te des Basques beach. At this end of town, you can also explore the <a href=\"https://www.citedelocean.com/en/\" title=\"\">Cit\u00e9 de l\u2019Oc\u00e9an</a>, an interactive nautical museum, which includes a virtual reality surf experience \u2013 the cheat\u2019s way to hit the waves.</p> <p><strong>Example journey</strong> <br>It\u2019s quite a distance, but a relatively quick and very easy way to whizz down to the south of France, and the scenery is a treat in itself. Take the 11.31 from London to Paris Gare du Nord, then from Paris Gare Montparnasse the 15.52 gets you to Biarritz in time for dinner at 19.58. Returning, the 09.58 gets to Paris Montparnasse at 14.08, then the 16.13 from Paris Gare du Nord gets into London at 17.39.</p> <p><strong>Stay</strong> <br><a href=\"https://www.biarritz-hotel-ocean.com/en/\" title=\"\">Hotel de l\u2019Oc\u00e9an</a> (doubles from \u20ac69 B&amp;B) is a friendly three-star hotel in the town centre, just above the Port des Pecheurs. <br><strong>CB</strong></p> <h2><strong>Ghent</strong>,<strong> </strong>Belgium</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"c8051694a3c59cdaf1209b98b12e3f52fcaeb0f8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c8051694a3c59cdaf1209b98b12e3f52fcaeb0f8/0_0_3900_2600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Medieval buildings overlooking the Graslei harbor on Leie River in Ghent town, Belgium, Europe.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Medieval buildings overlooking the Leie River.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Fastest journey from London</strong> 3\u00bd hours via Brussels<br><strong><a href=\"https://www.eurostar.com/uk-en/train/belgium/london-to-ghent\">Cheapest Nov fare with Eurostar</a></strong> \u00a378 return</p> <p>Ghent\u2019s cobbled streets, art nouveau townhouses and imposing gothic architecture initially give the feeling of having stepped back in time.

Lots of these sell locally made homeware and decoration, with tea towels, crockery and stationery designed by local artists (a Made in Ghent badge scheme provides helpful signposting).

But Belgium\u2019s second city is its uncontested capital of cool. It has a longstanding reputation as an international fashion hub, buoyed by the fame of the Antwerp Six, a group of designers who graduated from the city\u2019s art school in the early 1980s, but it\u2019s also a port city, where bars, clubs, art galleries and restaurants vie for space in converted warehouses.</p> <p>Those looking for Antwerp\u2019s hipper side should head to the formerly seedy docks area in the north. <a href=\"https://www.mas.be/en\" title=\"\">MAS</a>, a skyline-dominating red brick and glass block, is a museum that explores the city\u2019s maritime heritage where you can ascend to the roof for spectacular city views free of charge.

The heat from the pizza oven warms the offices on the top floor, and laid-back restaurant <a href=\"https://www.racinepakt.be/\" title=\"\">Racine</a> sources vegetables for its seasonal salads and cold-pressed juices from its rooftop garden.</p> <p>For more traditional flavours, the legendary <a href=\"https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g188636-d2226800-r542207830-Frituur_No_1-Antwerp_Antwerp_Province.html\" title=\"\">Frituur No 1</a> does Antwerp\u2019s most famous chips and mayo, presided over by owner Maria\u2019s unique, occasionally brusque style of service.</p> <p>The city is a shopper\u2019s paradise and winter collections will be arriving in store now.

Autumn is the perfect time for a short break.</p> <p>Rotterdam\u2019s biggest attraction is probably its architecture. Bombed heavily during the second world war, the city today boasts several daring modern tower blocks which would not look out of place in Manhattan. Begin your day with a walk along the riverbank to take in the skyline, perhaps followed by a visit to the famous <a href=\"http://kubuswoning.nl/en\" title=\"\">Cube Houses</a>, an apartment building which looks like a string of discarded yellow Rubik\u2019s Cubes.</p> <p>Nearby stands the <a href=\"https://markthal-en.klepierre.nl/\" title=\"\">Markthal</a>, a striking indoor food market housed in a building that looks like an upturned horseshoe. Browse the stalls and enjoy a basket of <em>kibbeling</em> fish nuggets, some local cheese or perhaps a glass of <em>jenever</em> (gin) brewed in nearby Schiedam.</p> <p>Rotterdam grew prosperous thanks to its location near the mouth of the River Rhine, and the city\u2019s giant port \u2013 the largest in Europe \u2013 has given it a tough, streetwise character.</p> <p>However, it also has a lively cultural scene. Highlights include the <a href=\"https://www.foam.org/\" title=\"\">Fotomuseum</a> photography museum and the <a href=\"https://www.kunsthal.nl/en/#tijdlijn-2019-10\" title=\"\">Kunsthal art museum</a>, which this autumn displays photographs by <a href=\"https://www.kunsthal.nl/en/plan-your-visit/exhibitions/daniel/\" title=\"\">Dani\u00ebl van de Ven</a> telling the story of Rotterdam\u2019s astonishing postwar rise. </p> <p>If you feel like roaming further afield, take a tram or metro to Delfshaven, where old sailing barges line the canals and you feel you might bump into Rembrandt or Vermeer around every corner.</p> <p>In the evening, watch the sun set as you walk over the famous Erasmusbrug (Erasmus Bridge) which connects the north and south sides of the city (once neglected, the south is now being gentrified). Have dinner at <a href=\"https://hotelnewyork.com/\" title=\"\">Hotel New York</a>, a grand brownstone building perched imperiously on the riverside. Soak up the panoramic views and dine on local mussels cooked in Pernod or fresh chilled crab legs. Afterwards, walk over the nearby footbridge to <a href=\"http://www.fenixfoodfactory.nl/\" title=\"\">Fenix Food Factory</a>, a hipster food market and craft brewery where the glasses are always half full. If the dark local beer goes to your head, you can always order a <a href=\"https://www.watertaxirotterdam.nl/\" title=\"\">water taxi</a> to zip you back across the river to bed.</p> <p><br><strong>Example journey</strong> <br>The Eurostar goes direct from London St Pancras to Rotterdam Central seven times a day (five times on Saturdays): depart at 07:16 and arrive at 11:32.

Energy returns in September, building to a crescendo when the <a href=\"https://www.lausanne-tourisme.ch/en/GP1494/christmas-markets\" title=\"\">Christmas market</a> kicks off at the end of November, sparking a month of <em>vin chaud</em>-fuelled revelry all over town.</p> <p>In between times, autumn has its own special appeal. For starters, it\u2019s the best season for walking. Head to the terraced vineyards of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2019/mar/15/cully-jazz-festval-lake-geneva-switzerland-wine-vineyards\" title=\"\">Lavaux</a>, just outside the city, where the turning leaves are at their most glorious and activity peaks with the annual grape harvest. Taste wine in the various caves as you stroll through the vines between the pretty medieval villages of Lutry and Saint-Saphorin, high above the lake.</p> <p>Alternatively, <a href=\"https://www.lausanne-tourisme.ch/en/P528/sauvabelin-park\" title=\"\">Sauvabelin park</a>, on a hill in the north of Lausanne, is a lovely spot to wander among kaleidoscopic trees \u2013 climb the wooden viewing tower to see the city and lake spread far below. On your way back downhill towards the town centre, stop at the wonderful <a href=\"https://www.fondation-hermitage.ch/actualite/\" title=\"\">Fondation Hermitage</a> to see the permanent collection of impressionist and post-impressionist painters.</p> <p>A new museum district opens in the city this autumn: <a href=\"https://plateforme10.ch/en\" title=\"\">Plateforme 10</a>, so-called because of its location near the nine platforms of the main rail station, will house three museums by 2021. The fine art museum, <a href=\"https://plateforme10.ch/en/partners/mcb-a\" title=\"\">Mus\u00e9e cantonal des Beaux-Arts</a>, is the first to move in this October, followed by the <a href=\"https://plateforme10.ch/en/partners/musee_de_l-elysee\" title=\"\">Mus\u00e9e de l\u2019Elys\u00e9e</a> (photography) and <a href=\"https://plateforme10.ch/en/partners/mudac\" title=\"\">Mudac</a> (contemporary design and applied arts).</p> <p>As it is home to the International Olympic Committee headquarters, Lausanne is also dubbed Switzerland\u2019s Olympic city, and it hosts the Winter Youth Olympic Games next January. The flashy <a href=\"https://www.olympic.org/museum\" title=\"\">Olympic Museum</a>, in the lakeside resort of Ouchy, south of the city centre, features a temporary multimedia exhibition, with 50 athletes sharing tales of their personal Olympic experiences. </p> <p>While it\u2019s always fondue time here (<a href=\"http://cafedugruetli.ch/\" title=\"\">Caf\u00e9 du Gr\u00fctli</a> does a good one), autumn in Switzerland means <em>la chasse</em> (hunting season), so game meats are on the menu at many restaurants in October and November, typically accompanied by <em>sp\u00e4tzl</em><em>e</em> (a sort of Swiss pasta), chestnuts, red cabbage and fruit.

      "bodyText": "N\u00eemes, France Fastest journey from London 6\u00bd hours via Paris Cheapest Nov fare with Eurostar \u00a3168 return With its remarkably well-preserved Roman amphitheatre plus its new museum of artefacts, not to mention great shops and restaurants, N\u00eemes makes a superb autumn destination. The crowds have gone and although the intense heat has rescinded, the surrounding hills trap the summer temperatures, making it warm enough to sit out on a cafe terrace and watch the world go by. Make your first port of call the amphitheatre - Les Ar\u00e8nes (entrance \u20ac13, including the other two Roman attractions mentioned below). Explore the interior corridors (vomitories), then climb to the top of the terraces to see the amphitheatre (133 metres long by 101 wide) in its full glory. The top tier also offers views of the surrounding hills (seven, just like Rome), including Mont Cavalier, the highest point of the city, on which the Roman Tour Magne, built by Augustus, stands sentinel. Opposite the amphitheatre, explore the Mus\u00e9e de la Romanit\u00e9, which opened in 2018 and holds a fascinating collection of artefacts, from large and exquisite mosaics to statues and glassware that survived 2,000 years buried in sarcophagi. There are interactive exhibits, too, which help bring the history to life. The museum\u2019s own architecture is also impressive \u2013 from its glass mosaic-tiled facade that represents the ripples of a toga, to the different levels within the museum that allow you to view the exhibits from above. Next stop should be N\u00eemes\u2019 old town: the warren of streets that runs north of the amphitheatre is punctuated with sunny squares, cafes and restaurants, along with independent boutiques for clothes, jewellery and homewares. Stop for lunch at Le Vintage, where you can devour bistro classics on its pavement terrace. Skip dessert though, because the best ice-cream and patisserie in town is a few steps away at Maison Villaret, which was established in 1775. Try its speciality, croquants \u2013 delicate almond biscuits flavoured with orange water. N\u00eemes is also famous for another kind of biscuit, caladons, with almonds and honey. The old town opens out into a grand square where La Maison Carr\u00e9, the only surviving intact Roman temple in France, stands proud on a plinth with bright white pillars. Inside, there\u2019s a screening of the film Nemausus, the Founding of N\u00eemes. Nearby, the Jardins de la Fontaine are the town\u2019s breathing space: these ornate baroque gardens feature terraces, statues and ornamental ponds, as well as the remains of the town\u2019s original water source, housed in the remains of the Temple de Diane. Up the hill behind it is the Tour Magne. For dinner, L\u2019Impr\u00e9vu serves seafood and Italian-inspired dishes and has a terrace on one of the city\u2019s liveliest squares, Place d\u2019Assas. Example journey Take the 09.24 from St Pancras, crossing Paris to Gare de Lyon for the 14.07 to Nimes, arriving at 17.05. Returning, the 07.58 gets to Paris Gare de Lyon at 10.53, then across Paris to Gare du Nord for the 12.13 to London, arriving at 13.30. Stay at cosy, beautifully decorated La Maison Rousseau B&amp;B (doubles from \u20ac105pn). It\u2019s in a peaceful spot and an easy walk to the main sites. Carolyn Boyd Angers, France Fastest journey from London 5 hours via Lille Cheapest Nov fare with Eurostar \u00a395 return Though it isn\u2019t as well-known as other cities of the Loire, Angers makes the most of its unique position on the River Maine, just before it joins the Loire, with riverside restaurants and enchanting cycle trails, as well as art deco architecture, distilleries and an imposing chateau at the heart of the city. Ch\u00e2teau d\u2019Angers is a good place to start. This mighty fortress is surrounded by 17 towers which punctuate its mighty 2\u00bd-metre thick walls. For superb views of the city and river, walk around its ramparts, which enclose a tiny vineyard and gardens. Inside, the rooms and exhibits tell the story of the Dukes of Anjou who held court here in the 14th and 15th centuries and were great patrons of the arts. The main draw, however, is the 104-metre Tapestry of the Apocalypse illustrating the Book of Revelations. It took seven years to complete in the late 14th century and its six-metre-high panels, which depict 90 scenes, are beautifully lit in an atmospheric gallery. The chateau\u2019s own restaurant serves good hearty dishes with mains from around \u20ac10. Outside the chateau, follow the blue line painted on the pavements to guide you around a loop of the best sights in the old town. Highlights include the beautiful medieval Cath\u00e9dral Saint-Maurice with its wonderful stained-glass windows. Just behind it is the six-storey, half-timbered Maison d\u2019Adam, built in 1491 and home to decorative carvings of bawdy figures. A chain department store wouldn\u2019t usually star in a city\u2019s list of must-sees, but the elegant facade and art deco glass roof of Galeries Lafayette will delight fans of fine design. For more art deco, keep following the blue line to La Maison Bleue, an apartment building built in 1929 and decorated with colourful mosaics and ornate ironwork. Autumn is the ideal time to pedal along the Loire \u00e0 V\u00e9lo cycling track, which follows the famous river. Hire bikes at Vert Event Angers (from \u20ac15 a day) and cycle 8km down to the attractive village of Bouchemaine, where Le No\u00e9 is one of the region\u2019s many guinguettes \u2013 riverside cafe-bistros that offer a host of entertainment, music and activities. Three kilometres to the east, just outside peaceful Sainte-Gemmes-sur-Loire village, is another hub of activity at Guinguette de Port-Thibaut, with superb views over the broad river. Further down the Loire, a 30-minute cycle away, is the \u00cele B\u00e9huard \u2013 an island with monastery and historic chapel at the heart of the characterful village. Angers is the home of Cointreau: the orange liqueur was created here in 1875 and visitors can tour the distillery. On the other side of town, Distillerie Giffard also has a visitor centre, with a range of liqueurs, including the Menthe-Pastille that made its name. Example journey Though most Eurostar journeys go via Paris, it is easier to go via Lille as there is a direct train from there to Angers. It also means you only have to cross the platform to change, rather than crossing Paris from Gard du Nord to Gare Montparnasse, and only one change. Take the 15.04 from London St Pancras, then the 17.52 from Lille. Returning, take the 12.41 to Lille, then the 17.35 back to London. Stay Hotel 21 Foch (doubles from \u20ac89 room only) is a small, contemporary hotel in the city centre. CB Biarritz, France Fastest journey from London 7\u00bd hours via Paris (about an hour longer inbound) Cheapest Nov fare with Eurostar \u00a3120 return For fresh sea air, fabulous food and Basque culture, a short break in Biarritz fits the bill even in the cooler months. Though its glorious golden beaches and surf culture may suggest it\u2019s a summer-only destination, there is plenty to draw you there in autumn. Try to time your visit with the F\u00eate de la Saint Martin (8-11 November) to see the town celebrate its Basque heritage through concerts, dance shows, workshops, food events and the Basque racket game, pelota. Foodies will love Restaurant Week also in early November (4-10), when many of the town\u2019s restaurants showcase their best Basque dishes for \u20ac20 for lunch or \u20ac30 for dinner. Though you can embrace the French Basque country\u2019s piquant cuisine any time of year at Les Halles market \u2013 tuck into pintxos (Basque tapas) and sip local wine at the many stalls. For goodies to take home, explore the town\u2019s many chocolateries, such as Pari\u00e8s or Maison Adam, and Rue Victor Hugo, home to the ultimate cheese shop, 1001 Fromages, and the Maison Arost\u00e9guy \u00e9picerie, which is rammed to the rafters with fantastic Basque and French products. The other streets that surround the market are great for restaurants, as is Rue Gambetta, leading south from the market. Elsewhere, one of the best tables in town is Le Pimpi Bistrot on Avenue de Verdun, where chef Manu Michel\u2019s dishes showcase the seafood, fish and charcuterie that the Basque country does so well, while nearby locals\u2019 favourite Tantina de Burgos on Place Beau Rivage serves excellent dishes flavoured with the local chilli pepper, piment d\u2019espelette. Autumn sees the mighty Atlantic waves roll ever more fiercely to shore, and if you dare take to the water there are several surf schools (try hastea.com, 90-minute group lessons from \u20ac40) to hire you a board, wetsuit and the guidance of an instructor. A more indulgent way to enjoy the sea, though, is with a thalassotherapy session \u2013 seawater therapy \u2013 which will blast, drench or sprinkle you with seawater in a variety of treatments said to help circulation and skin tone. Try it at the Sofitel (treatments from \u20ac45). Or to enjoy the ocean without getting wet, take a coastal walk from the lighthouse along the Grande Plage, through the cluster of fisherman\u2019s cabins at Port des P\u00eacheurs, and on to Le Rocher de la Vierge \u2013 a rock formation topped with a Virgin Mary statue, on the site of a miracle. Then follow the road around to the small Plage de Port Vieux, and finish at the incredible C\u00f4te des Basques beach. At this end of town, you can also explore the Cit\u00e9 de l\u2019Oc\u00e9an, an interactive nautical museum, which includes a virtual reality surf experience \u2013 the cheat\u2019s way to hit the waves. Example journey It\u2019s quite a distance, but a relatively quick and very easy way to whizz down to the south of France, and the scenery is a treat in itself. Take the 11.31 from London to Paris Gare du Nord, then from Paris Gare Montparnasse the 15.52 gets you to Biarritz in time for dinner at 19.58. Returning, the 09.58 gets to Paris Montparnasse at 14.08, then the 16.13 from Paris Gare du Nord gets into London at 17.39. Stay Hotel de l\u2019Oc\u00e9an (doubles from \u20ac69 B&amp;B) is a friendly three-star hotel in the town centre, just above the Port des Pecheurs. CB Ghent, Belgium Fastest journey from London 3\u00bd hours via Brussels Cheapest Nov fare with Eurostar \u00a378 return Ghent\u2019s cobbled streets, art nouveau townhouses and imposing gothic architecture initially give the feeling of having stepped back in time. But it doesn\u2019t take long to notice the city\u2019s other main appeal: a very modern eco-friendly shopping and food scene. The vegetarian food is varied and high quality \u2013 the city became the first in the world to introduce a weekly vegetarian day a decade ago. For a taste of the veggie scene, head for Lokaal, which serves \u20ac12 homely vegan bakes and quiches made using in-season produce, or fill your plate up at a wholesome vegan buffet of colourful salads and pulses at cooperatively run Lekker GEC. For something higher-end, Lof offers an elaborate five-course vegetarian dinner (\u20ac65) that can be paired with vegan wines, while Michelin-starred Vrijmoed has an award-winning seven-course vegetarian menu (\u20ac102) that ranges from Japanese-inspired glazed aubergine with kombu seaweed to more typically Belgian fare such as a pav\u00e9 of goat\u2019s cheese swirled with honey and nuts. Among Ghent\u2019s other charms are its prettily decorated independent shops. Lots of these sell locally made homeware and decoration, with tea towels, crockery and stationery designed by local artists (a Made in Ghent badge scheme provides helpful signposting). There\u2019s also an emphasis on fairly-made clothing from around the world at shops such as Just Hazel, Visitrice, Mieke and A.puura.a. If you want to shop and relax in a low C02-environment, Broesse is a plant shop which is part tropical jungle, part rattan-furnished cocktail bar, where a young crowd sip creative vermouth-based cocktails surrounded by palm fronds. It wouldn\u2019t be a trip to Belgium without sampling craft brews. The country\u2019s signature Trappist beers are arguably the original green business model: brewed by monks in small batches that prioritise sustainability and quality, they\u2019re available in most bars. For something more modern, go for a tour and tasting of the home brews in the giant taproom at microbrewery Dok, which is reinventing Belgium\u2019s storied beer tradition with new recipes and flavours; or ascend to historical music venue Vooruit\u2019s relaxed roof terrace to catch the last afternoon rays before winter. Ghent is also known for its thriving music scene, which keeps up the city\u2019s rootsy image through bands which play anything from punk to futuristic jazz in dimly lit bars like Trefpunt, Bar Mirwaar and Charlatan. The Vrijdag markt is a good place to start a bar-hopping evening \u2013 and thanks to the city\u2019s sizable student population, things are lively most nights of the week. Try nights run by the city\u2019s legendary Democrazy promoters. Getting there The Eurostar runs from London to Brussels eight times a day and a ticket includes a free onward journey to any Belgian station within 24 hours of departure. Trains to Ghent depart from Gare du Midi, where the Eurostar arrives, every 15 minutes and take 29 minutes. Stay Ghent\u2019s Eco Hostel Andromeda (doubles from \u20ac68) is a series of simple rooms and colourful shared spaces on a converted barge, and calls itself carbon-neutral. Water is purified on the roof, breakfasts are vegetarian, organic and fair trade, and mattresses are made from natural fibres. For a higher-end but still low-impact option, there\u2019s Studiomie\u2019s chic one-room hotel \u2013 the room features furnishings from local designers and Egyptian cotton sheets, all inside a shipping container (double from \u20ac130 room-only). Rachel Hall Antwerp, Belgium Fastest journey from London 3\u00be hours via Brussels Cheapest Nov fare with Eurostar \u00a378 return Antwerp\u2019s most obvious appeal is its winding, cobbled streets culminating in the spectacular gothic cathedrals of the Grote Markt. But Belgium\u2019s second city is its uncontested capital of cool. It has a longstanding reputation as an international fashion hub, buoyed by the fame of the Antwerp Six, a group of designers who graduated from the city\u2019s art school in the early 1980s, but it\u2019s also a port city, where bars, clubs, art galleries and restaurants vie for space in converted warehouses. Those looking for Antwerp\u2019s hipper side should head to the formerly seedy docks area in the north. MAS, a skyline-dominating red brick and glass block, is a museum that explores the city\u2019s maritime heritage where you can ascend to the roof for spectacular city views free of charge. Nearby is aBc, a brewery and taproom, which produces beers exploring Antwerp\u2019s brewing history, from the Seefbier, based on a 16th-century recipe, to Bootje\u2019s Bier, spiked with ginger and coriander. Move on to grungy Het Bos, a former anarchist squat turned cultural centre that hosts an eclectic mix of gigs, film showings, workshops and pop-up dinners. The city\u2019s post-industrial appeal extends to the south. One of the highlights is Pakt, a sustainably run warren of progressive businesses in a disused factory. The heat from the pizza oven warms the offices on the top floor, and laid-back restaurant Racine sources vegetables for its seasonal salads and cold-pressed juices from its rooftop garden. For more traditional flavours, the legendary Frituur No 1 does Antwerp\u2019s most famous chips and mayo, presided over by owner Maria\u2019s unique, occasionally brusque style of service. The city is a shopper\u2019s paradise and winter collections will be arriving in store now. The most obvious stop off is its fashion strip, Nationalestraat. Antwerpians particularly love \u201cconcept stores\u201d that mix fashion, lifestyle, food and art, such as Stay, which champions \u201cslow shopping\u201d by serving cappuccinos and style advice to encourage people to take their time and choose beautifully made pieces they\u2019ll keep forever. Visitors on this street should also rifle through pre-loved pieces at Melting Pot Kilo, which sells vintage threads by weight. A five-minute walk away, towards the sea, is Kloosterstraat, an iconic strip of antique shops, art galleries, vintage boutiques and designer outposts \u2013 try Five Fridays for Scandi style or Made By Hand, which showcases handcrafted jewellery and beautiful knits by local designers. Getting there See Ghent, above, for Eurostar details. Trains to Antwerp depart from Gare du Midi, where the Eurostar arrives, every 15 minutes and take from 45 minutes to an hour, depending on the train. Stay The stylish Hotel Indigo (doubles from \u20ac115 room-only) is part of a small international chain with decor in contrasting shades of pink and blue, with velvet and brass accents. Hotel Julien (doubles from \u20ac140 room-only), echoes Antwerp\u2019s signature mix of the historical and contemporary with beautifully renovated rooms in a 16th-century building. RH Rotterdam, the Netherlands Fastest journey from London 3\u00bc hours direct (4 hours inbound) Cheapest Nov fare with Eurostar \u00a386 return The Netherlands\u2019 second-largest city has world-class museums and galleries, excellent seafood and a feisty spirit \u2013 which makes it perfect for those who want to see the \u201creal\u201d modern Netherlands, away from the tourist hordes of Amsterdam. Autumn is the perfect time for a short break. Rotterdam\u2019s biggest attraction is probably its architecture. Bombed heavily during the second world war, the city today boasts several daring modern tower blocks which would not look out of place in Manhattan. Begin your day with a walk along the riverbank to take in the skyline, perhaps followed by a visit to the famous Cube Houses, an apartment building which looks like a string of discarded yellow Rubik\u2019s Cubes. Nearby stands the Markthal, a striking indoor food market housed in a building that looks like an upturned horseshoe. Browse the stalls and enjoy a basket of kibbeling fish nuggets, some local cheese or perhaps a glass of jenever (gin) brewed in nearby Schiedam. Rotterdam grew prosperous thanks to its location near the mouth of the River Rhine, and the city\u2019s giant port \u2013 the largest in Europe \u2013 has given it a tough, streetwise character. However, it also has a lively cultural scene. Highlights include the Fotomuseum photography museum and the Kunsthal art museum, which this autumn displays photographs by Dani\u00ebl van de Ven telling the story of Rotterdam\u2019s astonishing postwar rise. If you feel like roaming further afield, take a tram or metro to Delfshaven, where old sailing barges line the canals and you feel you might bump into Rembrandt or Vermeer around every corner. In the evening, watch the sun set as you walk over the famous Erasmusbrug (Erasmus Bridge) which connects the north and south sides of the city (once neglected, the south is now being gentrified). Have dinner at Hotel New York, a grand brownstone building perched imperiously on the riverside. Soak up the panoramic views and dine on local mussels cooked in Pernod or fresh chilled crab legs. Afterwards, walk over the nearby footbridge to Fenix Food Factory, a hipster food market and craft brewery where the glasses are always half full. If the dark local beer goes to your head, you can always order a water taxi to zip you back across the river to bed. Example journey The Eurostar goes direct from London St Pancras to Rotterdam Central seven times a day (five times on Saturdays): depart at 07:16 and arrive at 11:32. Returning, border restrictions mean you will have to change trains in Brussels: depart Rotterdam at 16.58 and arrive Brussels Midi at 18.08. You will then have time for a quick coffee before boarding the 18.56 Eurostar to London, which arrives at 19.57. Stay Hotel Bazar (doubles from \u20ac70 B&amp;B) is quirky, colourful and surrounded by lively bars and restaurants. Ben Coates, Netherlands-based author of The Rhine: Following Europe\u2019s Greatest River from Amsterdam to the Alps Arnhem, the Netherlands Fastest journey from London 5\u00bc hours via Amsterdam or Brussels Cheapest Nov fare with Loco2 \u00a3140 return As first impressions go, Arnhem railway station makes a grand statement. A soaring modernist structure made of undulating glass, exposed concrete and steel, it took two decades to build, at a cost of \u20ac37.5m. It ushers travellers into a city that has had its fair share of makeovers \u2013 most notably after the second world war battle in 1944, depicted in the film A Bridge Too Far, which left only 212 houses undamaged. Right outside the station is the 1oo-metre-long art wall called The Reconstruction. Painted by local artists and residents, it displays figures and events that played an important role in rebuilding the city. One of the icons is Marga Klomp\u00e9, who in 1956 became the Netherlands\u2019 first female cabinet minister, and whose work led to the social welfare law. The story of Operation Market Garden, the biggest airborne landing operation of the second world war, is told at the Airborne at the Bridge museum, the British headquarters during the battle. It\u2019s next to the John Frost Bridge over the Lower Rhine \u2013 the one that British, Canadian, Polish and American forces tried and failed to capture. Today, Arnhem is a city of fashion and design. Its art academy was home to internationally acclaimed fashion designers such as Viktor &amp; Rolf and Pauline van Dongen, and industrial designer Marcel Wanders. For unique items made by a local designer, visit the fashion district in the Klarendal neighbourhood, with its many studios and boutiques \u2013 try sustainable fashion label Studio Elsien Gringhuis, or Atelier Judith van den Berg for beautiful, handmade leather bags. Afterwards, go for a bite atop Karendal\u2019s hill at cafe/restaurant Sugar Hill, popular among Arnhemmers for its no-nonsense food (quality burgers, sandwiches, and three-course meals) and calm atmosphere. A 10-minute walk away is Caf\u00e9 Restaurant Caspar, with a wide variety of craft beers, like Mooie Nel (Pretty Nel) or Dunkel CC, and impressively large cups of coffee. While tourists have taken over the streets of Amsterdam, chances are you\u2019ll have those in Arnhem to yourself. Despite its lively cultural scene \u2013 18 museums and many concert options \u2013 the city is less of a tourist attraction, and has a much more laidback vibe. And it\u2019s much greener (or red and orange, this time of year). For the perfect autumn stroll, and to get your bearings, visit Sonsbeek city park and climb the spiral staircase of the 25-metre 19th-century Belv\u00e9d\u00e8re. The tower offers an excellent vantage over the city and its surroundings, but is only open to climb on the last Sunday of each month. Warm up afterwards in Stadsvilla Sonsbeek with a hot chocolate and Arnhemse meisje (sugary biscuit) on the side. Follow your Sonsbeek stroll with one in Hoge Veluwe national park, a sprawling nature reserve that includes one of Europe\u2019s largest sculpture gardens, featuring 160 artists including Barbara Hepworth, Aristide Maillol, Marta Pan and Pierre Huyghe. The park is also the home of the Kr\u00f6ller-M\u00fcller Museum, which boasts the second-largest Van Gogh collection in the world, with nearly 90 paintings and over 180 drawings. In the evening, make your way to cosy cafe Stella by Starlight, near Arnhem central station, for live music and beers selected by Arnhem\u2019s beer sommelier, Maarten Exel. Or go to cafe Stan&amp;Co, round the corner, to end the night dancing. Example journey Take the 11.04 from St Pancras, arriving at Amsterdam at 16.11; get the next (half-hourly) direct train to Arnhem central station (1 hour). To return, take the 13.56 from Arnhem central station, transfer at Breda to Brussels-Midi, arriving at 17:17 (1 hour 35 mins) and take the 18.04 to London, arriving at 21.05. Stay Hotel Molendal (doubles from \u20ac80 B&amp;B) is in an art nouveau building in Sonsbeek overlooking the park and a stone\u2019s throw from the concert hall Musis Sacrum (home to dance company Introdans) and the city centre. Caroline van Keeken, Netherlands-based writer and journalist Wiesbaden, Germany Fastest journey from London6\u00bc hours via Brussels and Frankfurt or Cologne (with short transfer times); 7\u00bc hours inbound Cheapest Nov fare with Loco2 \u00a3125 return In the 19th century, Wiesbaden was revered as the \u201ccatwalk of the society spa\u201d, with royalty, aristocracy and dignitaries from across Europe visiting this elegant town to see, be seen and benefit from the medicinal properties of the water. The heart of the spa town is the Kurhaus, which was rebuilt in 1907 in neo-classical style to house a restaurant, casino, ballroom and concert hall. The casino is located in the former wine parlour, a handsome room with cherry wood panelling and crystal chandeliers. The roulette wheel where Russian novelist Fyodor Dostoyevsky allegedly lost his fortune in 1865 \u2013 and which inspired his short novel, The Gambler \u2013 is on display. It\u2019s a pleasant way to while away a few hours, and a few euros, in splendid historic surroundings, while sipping a glass of sparkling Henkell trocken, the locally produced sekt sparkling wine. To experience the healing water, try the Kaiser-Friedrich-Therme, a beautifully restored art nouveau baths with green-tiled interior and Roman frescoes. As the nights draw in and temperatures drop, do as the Germans do and go textile-free into the tranquility of the soothing, warm water. If art nouveau decor piques your interest, the Museum of Wiesbaden\u2019s recently opened permanent exhibition is a must. It\u2019s one of the most important private collections in Europe, donated by local patron and former art dealer FW Neess with over 500 original objects, paintings and pieces of furniture \u2013 look out for the Nature sculpture by Alphonse Mucha, and furniture and glass pieces by belle \u00e9poque designer Louis Majorelle. Art and spas aside, wine is the reason many visitors come to Wiesbaden. Known as the \u201cgateway to the Rheingau\u201d, the most distinguished wine-growing region in the Rhine valley, this is the place to discover refined rieslings or a full-bodied sp\u00e4tburgunder. Among the stalls overflowing with flowers, fruit, cheese and bread, the Wiesbaden Winegrowers stand can be found at the weekly Saturday farmers\u2019 market, where various wineries take turns to present their produce to try for a few euros a glass. For a more formal tasting, Balthasar Ress in the centre of town offers wines at good-value winery prices, along with plates of local cheeses, meats, gherkins and bread. This chic little town is also home to one of the few urban vineyards in Germany, the Neroberg. Take the cute yellow funicular train, the Nerobergbahn up to the hillside estate for panoramic views across the vineyard, town and over the Rhine to Mainz. From here, there are various nature trails through the forest to enjoy and a magnificent, if a little incongruous, Russian Orthodox church, an opulent monument to Princess Elizabeth Michailowna, the Russian wife of Duke Adolph von Nassau, who died here in childbirth. For something more testing, the Kletterwald Neroberg offers 10 gradients of rope-slung courses high in the treetops, a great activity for families with children aged four and over. Head back into town for a shopping spree along upmarket Wilhelmstrasse and get cosy in Webers Wikinger for a traditional fireside schnitzel, roast potatoes and more of that glorious riesling. Example journey Take the 08.55 Eurostar from London St Pancras, arriving in Brussels at 12.05; board the 12.25 to Frankfurt Airport, arriving at 15.16; then depart for Wiesbaden on the 15.50, arriving at 16.10. The return journey leaving Wiesbaden at 07.41 arrives in London at 14.05. Stay The laid-back Hotel Klemm (doubles from \u20ac90 B&amp;B) occupies a smart red-brick art nouveau villa and has a stylish decor. Celia Topping Cologne, Germany Fastest journey from London 4 hours via Brussels Cheapest Nov fare with Eurostar \u00a3115 return Cologne station is in the shadow of the city\u2019s dramatic gothic cathedral. It\u2019s well worth a trip up the 533 steps, past Fat Pete (the largest free-swinging church bell in the world) and up to the observation platform for panoramic views of the city and beyond. Walking south from the cathedral takes you through the charming cobbled streets of the old town, with its skinny pastel-coloured houses and architectural gems such as the Romanesque Gross St Martin church. Enjoy a traditional halve hahn (gouda cheese with a rye roll, raw onions, pickles and a dollop of mustard) from Peter\u2019s Brauhaus and wash it down with a cold K\u00f6lsch, the local beer. Venturing further south along the river will take you to the recently modernised, popular waterfront district of Rheinauhafen. The Kranh\u00e4user (crane towers) dominate the skyline of this former industrial dockland area, and the curious blend of old and new buildings makes for an interesting stroll. On a chilly autumn day, warm up in the boat-like Chocolate Museum, reached by a swing bridge, and enjoy fine Rhine views. The west is traditionally seen as the classy side of the river, whereas the east bank was known as Sch\u00e4l Sick, the rather undesirable \u201cwrong\u201d side. But things have changed in recent times, with prices pushing residents over the river, and regeneration projects such as the Rheinboulevard making a trip across the Hohenzollern bridge genuinely worthwhile \u2013 rather than just for \u201cthat photo\u201d of the bridge and cathedral. Turn left and head north from the bridge, stopping for a drink at the Rheinterrassen, and onwards through the Rheinpark, one of the region\u2019s green spaces. From here, catch the K\u00f6lner Seilbahn (cable car) back over the river to Cologne\u2019s truly wonderful zoo. This is a zoo for people who don\u2019t like zoos, with happy animals that produce lots of babies, huge enclosures and a delightful programme of special events. But if this really isn\u2019t your thing, the botanical gardens are just next door, perfect for brisk autumn days, with a deliciously warm Palm House and beautiful greenhouses filled with tropical plants. With two such exceptional attractions nearby, the Sculpture Park often goes unnoticed, which is a shame, as this small, free-to-enter park houses a remarkable collection of international contemporary sculpture, and is newly curated every two years. Cologne is also home to several superb museums, including the Roman-Germanic Museum and Museum Ludwig. If you can, plan your visit for Museum Night on 2 November, for over 200 concerts, exhibitions, DJs and other artistic events at locations across the city until 2am. For a more low-key evening\u2019s entertainment, head over to the hip Belgisches Viertel (Belgian Quarter), buy a K\u00f6lsch from a kiosk and go people-watching in Br\u00fcsseler Platz as night falls. From here it\u2019s a short step to some of the area\u2019s coolest bars, with classics like the super-popular Sixpack, or Salon Schmitz, where the bold and beautiful of the city go out in style. Example journey Take the 8.55 Eurostar from London, arriving in Brussels at 12.05; catch the 12.25 to Cologne arriving at 14.15. The return journey leaving Cologne at 08.55 arrives in London at 14.15. Stay Maison Marsil (doubles around \u00a395 room-only) is in the old town between the Rhine and the Belgian Quarter. CT Lausanne, Switzerland Fastest journey from London 7\u00bc hours via Paris Cheapest Nov fare with Loco2 \u00a3175 return There\u2019s a back-to-work atmosphere in Lausanne each autumn, after a summer in which most people spend their free time lazing by Lake Geneva or escaping the heat for the cool of the mountains, leaving the city centre in a slumber. Energy returns in September, building to a crescendo when the Christmas market kicks off at the end of November, sparking a month of vin chaud-fuelled revelry all over town. In between times, autumn has its own special appeal. For starters, it\u2019s the best season for walking. Head to the terraced vineyards of Lavaux, just outside the city, where the turning leaves are at their most glorious and activity peaks with the annual grape harvest. Taste wine in the various caves as you stroll through the vines between the pretty medieval villages of Lutry and Saint-Saphorin, high above the lake. Alternatively, Sauvabelin park, on a hill in the north of Lausanne, is a lovely spot to wander among kaleidoscopic trees \u2013 climb the wooden viewing tower to see the city and lake spread far below. On your way back downhill towards the town centre, stop at the wonderful Fondation Hermitage to see the permanent collection of impressionist and post-impressionist painters. A new museum district opens in the city this autumn: Plateforme 10, so-called because of its location near the nine platforms of the main rail station, will house three museums by 2021. The fine art museum, Mus\u00e9e cantonal des Beaux-Arts, is the first to move in this October, followed by the Mus\u00e9e de l\u2019Elys\u00e9e (photography) and Mudac (contemporary design and applied arts). As it is home to the International Olympic Committee headquarters, Lausanne is also dubbed Switzerland\u2019s Olympic city, and it hosts the Winter Youth Olympic Games next January. The flashy Olympic Museum, in the lakeside resort of Ouchy, south of the city centre, features a temporary multimedia exhibition, with 50 athletes sharing tales of their personal Olympic experiences. While it\u2019s always fondue time here (Caf\u00e9 du Gr\u00fctli does a good one), autumn in Switzerland means la chasse (hunting season), so game meats are on the menu at many restaurants in October and November, typically accompanied by sp\u00e4tzle (a sort of Swiss pasta), chestnuts, red cabbage and fruit. Try wild boar stew at Brasserie de Montbenon, or venison filet mignon with truffles and grapes at La Croix d\u2019Ouchy, where you should turn up ravenous, since you get two servings. For a non-game lunch or brunch, Le Pointu is a good bet for salads and tranches (fancy open sandwiches) if you can get a table \u2013 it\u2019s hugely popular; or head to Lausanne institution La Chandeleur for a simple sweet cr\u00eape. For an ap\u00e9ro, Les Boucaniers has a good beer list, or try local wines at crowdfunded bar, Ta Cave. Example journey Take the 11.31 Eurostar from London to Paris Nord, arriving at 14.47; cross to Paris Gare de Lyon by taxi/metro, to take the 15.57 TGV to Lausanne, arriving at 19.37. To return, take the 13.31 from Lausanne, changing again in Paris, and you\u2019ll be back in London by 21.37. Stay The Alpha Palmiers (doubles from \u20ac129 room only), a light, bright space with a central tropical garden, near the railway station.

So when she was making her 2017 show <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jun/27/hannah-gadsbys-nanette-dares-to-dream-of-a-different-future-for-ourselves-and-for-comedy\">Nanette</a>, and beginning to sense it might be rather good, the Australian comic dared to dream an impossible dream. \u201cI remember thinking: \u2018Wow, it would be great to be able to not worry about whether I\u2019ll sell the room on a Wednesday.\u201d</p> <p>Reader: her dreams came true \u2013 and then some. Nanette, a disavowal of comedy (its lies and omissions, the damage it can do) disguised as a standup show, became one of the major entertainment events of the decade. It won the biggest prizes at the Melbourne and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/aug/26/edinburgh-fringe-comedy-award-shared-hannah-gadsby-john-robins\">Edinburgh</a> comedy festivals, toured the world, and its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jul/16/hannah-gadsby-trauma-comedy-nanette-standup-netflix\">Netflix special became a cultural phenomenon</a>, earning Gadsby a best writing award at last month\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/sep/15/hannah-gadsby-beats-beyonce-to-emmy-for-comedy-special-nanette\">Emmys</a>. Far from worrying if anyone will show up, she now counts Emma Thompson and <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/10/monica-lewinsky-and-hannah-gadsby-in-conversation\">Monica Lewinsky</a> among her many famous fans. \u201cIt really is mind-boggling what\u2019s happened to me,\u201d says Gadsby, mid-tour and cheerful on the phone from the US. \u201cLiterally my mind is boggling.\u201d Then \u2013 never one to leave an imprecision hanging \u2013 she qualifies: \u201cActually that\u2019s not literal: I don\u2019t know what boggling means.\u201d</p> <p>The show she is touring is her first post-Nanette offering, entitled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/mar/29/hannah-gadsby-douglas-review-comedian-brings-laughs-but-retains-edge-in-nanette-follow-up\">Douglas</a>. It is playing to audiences far bigger than Gadsby had become used to (even the Wednesdays are selling), and will land in the UK this month. As we shall see, it\u2019s a reaction to the furore around its predecessor, as well as a placeholder while Gadsby calculates what to do with her new status. She has not adjusted to it yet \u2013 her life has changed beyond recognition \u2013 and is still puzzling over what made Nanette so profound an experience for so many.</p> <p>\u201cAs I toured Nanette,\u201d she reflects, \u201cthe #MeToo movement hit its straps. There was a zeitgeist that made it blow up like it did.\u201d Nanette was about Gadsby\u2019s sometimes brutal experiences of sexism and homophobia, particularly in her native Tasmania. With meticulous control, it spoke about how she turned those experiences into jokes \u2013 and, by doing so, collaborated in her own oppression. At least to begin with, it didn\u2019t stint on classic one-liners (\u201cI\u2019m not lesbian enough \u2026 I mean, I keep my hand in\u201d) but it repurposed them to radical effect (\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to be a straight white man if you paid me, although the pay would be substantially better\u201d). Then \u2013 bait-and-switch successfully accomplished \u2013 it set the gags aside, and instead delivered a savage critique of how comedy works and which stories it will and won\u2019t let us tell.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"edf584cc1ab4297de7529c4d52379746c523f5d2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/edf584cc1ab4297de7529c4d52379746c523f5d2/2_0_1335_801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hannah Gadsby Nanette Netflix press publicity still Guardian Image colour corrected\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hannah Gadsby performing Nanette.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben King/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That may be why, Gadsby speculates, a lot of people \u201cwho don\u2019t feel catered for by standup as it has usually been\u201d flocked to her show. \u201cBut also,\u201d she admits, wrestling with the reasons for Nanette\u2019s impact, \u201cI have no idea. I could give you a lot of theories. I put a lot of work into that show. It\u2019s not an accidental piece of work. But I wouldn\u2019t be able to tell you what the recipe was that made it land like it did.\u201d</p> <p>If the explanation is elusive, there is no doubt about the show\u2019s transformative effect on the 41-year-old\u2019s life. Gadsby was a respected fringe-festival regular. Her style was downbeat bordering on dour, with the low energy redeemed by forensic wit (often at her own expense) and the kind of heavy sardonicism signalled by 2011\u2019s show title Mrs Chuckles. It all added up to a credible \u2013 if not lucrative \u2013 standup career: until Nanette, she \u201cdidn\u2019t believe I\u2019d ever be able to afford a home of my own\u201d.</p> <p>The show\u2019s success put the kibosh on Gadsby\u2019s plan to retire from standup. She made the \u201cI quit\u201d announcement onstage as part of the show; it was a key part of Nanette\u2019s excoriating effect. Now, she reclassifies that as a theatrical device. \u201cIt became this very odd mix of a conceit and also: \u2018I mean it.\u2019 What it meant was: \u2018I don\u2019t care about my reputation as a comedian. I don\u2019t care about the artform of comedy. I care more about what I\u2019m saying, not how I am saying it.\u2019 But it became cathartic for me to say it onstage and kind of believe it.\u201d She pauses, then \u2013 as if she needs to justify still being a comedian \u2013 adds: \u201cbut also: what am I going to do? Sit on a park bench? I can\u2019t quit. I\u2019ve no other skill set.\u201d</p> <p>So here she still is, a full-time, gigging comedian, albeit one whose sense of herself has changed dramatically. \u201cBefore Nanette,\u201d she says, \u201cI didn\u2019t feel like a powerful person at all. I was always very low status. And now I have high status. I have a platform, and a lot of people will read or listen to what I say.

Which is important for me, because I put myself through the wringer performing Nanette.\u201d In Douglas, she riffs on men who play golf, her unlikely new life in LA \u2013 and Where\u2019s Wally. (\u201c[He] should have to find himself like the rest of us do.\u201d) Intentionally or otherwise, the lighter tone addresses the most common criticism of Nanette, which is that, because of its seriousness, it wasn\u2019t comedy \u2013 and Gadsby, by implication, wasn\u2019t a comedian at all.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8a4fc71d4c7e2b354ec7f503e6a9acb06319cb95\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8a4fc71d4c7e2b354ec7f503e6a9acb06319cb95/0_0_5184_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gadsby with Jasper and Douglas\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paws for thought...

      "bodyText": "Over her 10-year standup career, Hannah Gadsby had played to more than a few thin midweek houses. So when she was making her 2017 show Nanette, and beginning to sense it might be rather good, the Australian comic dared to dream an impossible dream. \u201cI remember thinking: \u2018Wow, it would be great to be able to not worry about whether I\u2019ll sell the room on a Wednesday.\u201d Reader: her dreams came true \u2013 and then some. Nanette, a disavowal of comedy (its lies and omissions, the damage it can do) disguised as a standup show, became one of the major entertainment events of the decade. It won the biggest prizes at the Melbourne and Edinburgh comedy festivals, toured the world, and its Netflix special became a cultural phenomenon, earning Gadsby a best writing award at last month\u2019s Emmys. Far from worrying if anyone will show up, she now counts Emma Thompson and Monica Lewinsky among her many famous fans. \u201cIt really is mind-boggling what\u2019s happened to me,\u201d says Gadsby, mid-tour and cheerful on the phone from the US. \u201cLiterally my mind is boggling.\u201d Then \u2013 never one to leave an imprecision hanging \u2013 she qualifies: \u201cActually that\u2019s not literal: I don\u2019t know what boggling means.\u201d The show she is touring is her first post-Nanette offering, entitled Douglas. It is playing to audiences far bigger than Gadsby had become used to (even the Wednesdays are selling), and will land in the UK this month. As we shall see, it\u2019s a reaction to the furore around its predecessor, as well as a placeholder while Gadsby calculates what to do with her new status. She has not adjusted to it yet \u2013 her life has changed beyond recognition \u2013 and is still puzzling over what made Nanette so profound an experience for so many. \u201cAs I toured Nanette,\u201d she reflects, \u201cthe #MeToo movement hit its straps. There was a zeitgeist that made it blow up like it did.\u201d Nanette was about Gadsby\u2019s sometimes brutal experiences of sexism and homophobia, particularly in her native Tasmania. With meticulous control, it spoke about how she turned those experiences into jokes \u2013 and, by doing so, collaborated in her own oppression. At least to begin with, it didn\u2019t stint on classic one-liners (\u201cI\u2019m not lesbian enough \u2026 I mean, I keep my hand in\u201d) but it repurposed them to radical effect (\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to be a straight white man if you paid me, although the pay would be substantially better\u201d). Then \u2013 bait-and-switch successfully accomplished \u2013 it set the gags aside, and instead delivered a savage critique of how comedy works and which stories it will and won\u2019t let us tell. That may be why, Gadsby speculates, a lot of people \u201cwho don\u2019t feel catered for by standup as it has usually been\u201d flocked to her show. \u201cBut also,\u201d she admits, wrestling with the reasons for Nanette\u2019s impact, \u201cI have no idea. I could give you a lot of theories. I put a lot of work into that show. It\u2019s not an accidental piece of work. But I wouldn\u2019t be able to tell you what the recipe was that made it land like it did.\u201d If the explanation is elusive, there is no doubt about the show\u2019s transformative effect on the 41-year-old\u2019s life. Gadsby was a respected fringe-festival regular. Her style was downbeat bordering on dour, with the low energy redeemed by forensic wit (often at her own expense) and the kind of heavy sardonicism signalled by 2011\u2019s show title Mrs Chuckles. It all added up to a credible \u2013 if not lucrative \u2013 standup career: until Nanette, she \u201cdidn\u2019t believe I\u2019d ever be able to afford a home of my own\u201d. The show\u2019s success put the kibosh on Gadsby\u2019s plan to retire from standup. She made the \u201cI quit\u201d announcement onstage as part of the show; it was a key part of Nanette\u2019s excoriating effect. Now, she reclassifies that as a theatrical device. \u201cIt became this very odd mix of a conceit and also: \u2018I mean it.\u2019 What it meant was: \u2018I don\u2019t care about my reputation as a comedian. I don\u2019t care about the artform of comedy. I care more about what I\u2019m saying, not how I am saying it.\u2019 But it became cathartic for me to say it onstage and kind of believe it.\u201d She pauses, then \u2013 as if she needs to justify still being a comedian \u2013 adds: \u201cbut also: what am I going to do? Sit on a park bench? I can\u2019t quit. I\u2019ve no other skill set.\u201d So here she still is, a full-time, gigging comedian, albeit one whose sense of herself has changed dramatically. \u201cBefore Nanette,\u201d she says, \u201cI didn\u2019t feel like a powerful person at all. I was always very low status. And now I have high status. I have a platform, and a lot of people will read or listen to what I say. I am not, as an individual, oppressed any more,\u201d she says, the amazement audible in her voice. \u201cBut I still represent a collection of identities that are oppressed minorities.\u201d As an art history graduate (she has made shows on the subject; one of Nanette\u2019s most pointed routines was about Picasso), it amuses Gadsby \u2013 a self-described \u201cbig queer woman from a low socio-economic background\u201d \u2013 that her work is now canonical. \u201cIt\u2019s really funny to me that if there\u2019s a canon of comedy \u2013 which is not an idea I\u2019m a fan of \u2013 then I\u2019ve just sort of plopped myself in there.\u201d But the adjustment she is having to make is practical as well as conceptual. Her life is busier and harder to navigate now \u2013 which is not easy for a woman who has been vocal in the past about her social unease. \u201cI am finding it hard,\u201d she agrees, \u201cbecause I like familiarity and there\u2019s not much about my life just now that is familiar.\u201d Which brings us to Douglas, one of the standout themes of which is Gadsby\u2019s autism.

I\u2019m not your typical student: I probably only go out once a week or, more accurately, once every two weeks. I\u2019m not into mad nights out and clubbing. Let\u2019s put it bluntly \u2013 if I did have those classic kind of night outs several times a week, I\u2019d have very little money left at the end of the week.</p> <p>At Durham I\u2019ve really had to budget. I work out how much I need every month. I\u2019ve started to use a spreadsheet \u2013 my dad loves a spreadsheet. I was sceptical but this year I\u2019ve really got into it. I\u2019ve had to be very frugal. Durham is quite an expensive city, and drinks are costly, so you have to be quite savvy in terms of eating and going out.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/oct/12/i-set-up-a-funeral-firm-to-help-people-not-to-make-money\">\u2018I set up a funeral firm to help people, not to make money\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I receive a student loan of \u00a34,500 a year. I\u2019m living with five lads in a house share half a mile from the city centre, which costs \u00a3105 a week each. Fortunately my parents pay for my rent in Durham, which is quite expensive compared with other cities. I pay for the bills, which come to about \u00a315 a month each. We use apps such as Splitwise to work out what we owe if one of us buys a toaster or a kettle or pays a bill.</p> <p>My main living costs are food and drink. I\u2019m super-organised and budget food costs. I spend about \u00a345 a week on my food shop, which is certainly not excessive or extravagant. I might miss lunch occasionally, but that doesn\u2019t matter as I\u2019m trying to lose weight anyway. I love cooking and having friends over. I do shop around for the best deals and check out the products in the reduced section.

I\u2019m not your typical student: I probably only go out once a week or, more accurately, once every two weeks. I\u2019m not into mad nights out and clubbing. Let\u2019s put it bluntly \u2013 if I did have those classic kind of night outs several times a week, I\u2019d have very little money left at the end of the week. At Durham I\u2019ve really had to budget. I work out how much I need every month. I\u2019ve started to use a spreadsheet \u2013 my dad loves a spreadsheet. I was sceptical but this year I\u2019ve really got into it. I\u2019ve had to be very frugal. Durham is quite an expensive city, and drinks are costly, so you have to be quite savvy in terms of eating and going out. I receive a student loan of \u00a34,500 a year. I\u2019m living with five lads in a house share half a mile from the city centre, which costs \u00a3105 a week each. Fortunately my parents pay for my rent in Durham, which is quite expensive compared with other cities. I pay for the bills, which come to about \u00a315 a month each. We use apps such as Splitwise to work out what we owe if one of us buys a toaster or a kettle or pays a bill. My main living costs are food and drink. I\u2019m super-organised and budget food costs. I spend about \u00a345 a week on my food shop, which is certainly not excessive or extravagant. I might miss lunch occasionally, but that doesn\u2019t matter as I\u2019m trying to lose weight anyway. I love cooking and having friends over. I do shop around for the best deals and check out the products in the reduced section. I treat myself to the occasional meal out at somewhere such as Nando\u2019s. I really like to go travelling. I\u2019ve had two amazing holidays in the past year: I visited Bali and Italy for a week each. This year has been a freak year as it\u2019s been my 21st, and my mum is not very well at all.

Sykes also died in the fire.</p> <p>She says: \u201cUnbeknown to all of us, he cancelled the house insurance in June, and in October, two weeks after we separated, he started 14 fires in the house and barricaded our sons in. He also sent a letter to the bank saying he would kill himself, and that I would be responsible for the \u00a350,000 mortgage because he was dead. It was incredible that the bank received it and did nothing about it.\u201d</p> <p>The bank, HSBC, insisted the \u00a350,000 needed to be paid, she says: \u201cThe house was completely destroyed and worth nothing. I had to keep going to the bank every few months and show pictures [of her destroyed home]. If it hadn\u2019t been for the community who rebuilt the house with their own materials and their own time, then I wouldn\u2019t be there.

We have trained all branch staff on how to spot the signs of abuse, and have dedicated procedures in place to help customers regain control of their finances.\u201d</p> <p>Claire says that too frequently, survivors are left destitute as a result of their perpetrator\u2019s behaviour. \u201cIt\u2019s essential that these cases are properly investigated and that survivors are not left to pay off huge mortgages and other debts as a consequence of their partner\u2019s abusive behaviour,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Isabelle*, 52, who lives in Swansea, met her husband while on holiday in Cuba in 2006 and says she was coerced into marriage after six months. \u201cI was afraid to say no,\u201d she says. The domestic abuse soon increased. They were together for four years until she left him. Unable to buy a house on her own, a year later she says she \u201cnaively\u201d asked him to help her get a mortgage by signing his name to the contract. \u201cI was moving in on my own, buying it, and I paid all the deposit.\u201d But she soon discovered she wouldn\u2019t be living there alone. \u201cHe said \u2018I\u2019m coming and moving in, you can\u2019t stop me\u2019. If I\u2019m honest, I tried to give it a go, but he assaulted me in 2012, and that led to a conviction for GBH.\u201d</p> <p>They continued to have an on-off relationship but, when she tried to sell the house, he would not let her. \u201cI can\u2019t sell the property as he won\u2019t let me. I pay for everything and should be allowed to sell, but I\u2019m not allowed.\u201d</p> <p>Her ex-partner refused to sign for a new, and lower, mortgage rate when it was due for renewal. \u201cHe told me he was going to ruin me,\u201d says Isabelle, a healthcare worker. \u201cI asked Santander to intervene, but they said they could not help me.\u201d The rate was set to increase from 2.99% to 4.9%, forcing her to pay out an extra \u00a3180 a month.</p> <p>Santander sent a letter to her husband asking him to sign the paperwork, but he didn\u2019t respond. After much persistence, five months later, eventually Santander intervened and provided a fixed rate for two years. \u201cIf someone has got a joint mortgage and only one person is paying, why should they need a second signature? He controls what I pay \u2013 it\u2019s another form of control.\u201d</p> <p>While Wendy\u2019s ex no longer controls her biggest outgoing, she wants financial institutions to have a clearer understanding of what financial abuse is, and be more sympathetic. \u201cIf the other person is meeting the financial obligations, they should step in,\u201d she says. \u201cYou can\u2019t have one paying for everything and then need the signature of the other half who is not contributing.\u201d<em>* Some names have been changed</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Mortgages with a maximum term of 40 years are now becoming the norm, according to new data this week. However, with the average age of a first-time buyer standing at 32, that raises the prospect of a generation of homeowners not achieving mortgage-free status until they are in their 70s. Latest research from the data experts at Moneyfacts.co.uk shows that 57% of the residential mortgage products currently available have a standard maximum term of up to 40 years \u2013 up from just under 36% in March 2014. It provides more evidence that the traditional 25-year mortgage is increasingly becoming a thing of the past, particularly when it comes to first-timers. Yorkshire building society this month became the latest big provider to increase its maximum term to 40 years. By stretching the term, borrowers can reduce their monthly payments and are therefore more likely to meet banks\u2019 strict affordability rules. But there\u2019s a big sting in the tail. Moneyfacts gives the example of a \u00a3250,000 repayment home loan with an interest rate of 2.5%. Over 25 years, that equates to a monthly repayment of \u00a31,121, and the total interest payable would be \u00a386,463.

Following previous Extinction Rebellion action, only about 10% of those arrested were charged, but it could well be higher this time. There has been a hardening of attitudes this week at the Home Office and the Metropolitan police, and the Met has warned it will be pushing for more prosecutions this time round.</p> <p>Prosecutions can lead to unspent convictions and \u2013 while that might sound technical \u2013 it is these that can cause the biggest problems. Extinction Rebellion does not duck this issue on its website, <a href=\"https://rebellion.earth/act-now/resources/legal-info/\" title=\"\">which has downloads and FAQs covering this area</a>. \u201cBefore attending an action, it\u2019s crucial that all rebels inform themselves about their rights as protesters and the possible consequences of arrest,\u201d it says.</p> <p>This article is not designed to put anyone off participating in protests. The aim is to clearly spell out the implications that being arrested could have so individuals can make an informed choice.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c95326abc91f2e48dc8abedc05181134a940e028\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c95326abc91f2e48dc8abedc05181134a940e028/0_0_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Police officers arrest anti-fracking protesters outside a drill site in Balcombe, West Sussex\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Police officers arrest anti-fracking protesters outside a drill site in Balcombe, West Sussex.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Unspent convictions</strong></h2> <p>A criminal conviction can be for anything from a serious crime resulting in a prison sentence to littering or speeding leading to a fine. It is likely that in the case of most of those charged this week, it will be for failing to leave a controlled area of London when instructed to do so by a police officer.</p> <p>Once someone has been convicted, that conviction is deemed to be current \u2013 or unspent \u2013 for a period based on the sentence. The more serious the conviction, the longer it remains unspent.</p> <p>In short, convictions are what insurers, mortgage companies, employers and other organisations do not want to see on your \u201cfile\u201d. For example, British Heart Foundation does not accept volunteers to work in its shops if they have any type of unspent conviction.</p> <p>John Briant, an Oxford-based criminal barrister who has been advising local Extinction Rebellion protesters about the implications of being arrested, says most of those previously arrested who chose to go to court have ended up with a conditional discharge of six months and/or a fine related to income. Conditional discharges are only considered to be spent at the end of that term \u2013 typically six or nine months.</p> <p>For those who are fined in court, the conviction is only considered to be spent a year from conviction. Those given a community order face a year on top of the order\u2019s length.</p> <p>The extraordinary 15-month prison sentences <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/26/anti-fracking-activists-jailed-for-blackpool-cuadrilla-protest\" title=\"\">meted out to anti-fracking protesters</a> are a much bigger problem, as the conviction is not considered spent for a further four years on top of the sentence.</p> <h2><strong>Home insurance</strong></h2> <p>It may sound ridiculous, but a 70-year-old retired teacher who may have never claimed on their home insurance is unlikely to have their policy renewed once they reveal they have an unspent conviction.</p> <p>Christopher Stacey, a co-director of the charity <a href=\"https://www.unlock.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Unlock</a>, which was set up 20 years ago to help people with all types of convictions, says most big insurers will not renew, or issue a new household policy, when they learn someone in the insured household has an unspent conviction. Several insurers including Direct Line, LV= and Aviva told Money this was the case.</p> <p>\u201cGetting insurance can be a big problem for people with an unspent conviction. For those with existing house insurance, if you don\u2019t notify them of the change when you next renew, the firm could refuse to pay out if you later try to claim. We have seen this happen in the past, particularly when people have let their policy simply automatically renew,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Convicted protesters given a six-month conditional discharge would be fine if their renewal came up after it was considered spent. However, if it fell within the six months, it would be unlikely to be renewed \u2013 if you admit it. Unlock has <a href=\"https://hub.unlock.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/List-of-Insurance-Brokers.pdf\" title=\"\">produced a list of specialist brokers</a> who will help those with an unspent conviction find insurance cover, but this is likely to come at a cost.</p> <p>Some insurers have a clause in their terms and conditions that requires the customer to inform them of a conviction, at any time. One of the UK\u2019s largest, Aviva, told Money it insists customers inform it of any new non-motoring convictions \u201cas soon as reasonably possible\u201d. It admits it could lead to a decline or cancellation of the policy, either at the time or at the point of renewal. As soon as your conviction is spent, you have no obligation to mention it to an insurer. The <a href=\"http://www.disclosurecalculator.org.uk/go\" title=\"\">Unlock calculator</a> can help with this.</p> <h2><strong>Car insurance</strong></h2> <p>Car insurers are not so obsessed with non-motoring convictions unless they are serious and relate to theft, fraud or handling stolen goods. Again, you will have to declare any unspent convictions at renewal. However, Aviva said it would insure a driver with a minor protest conviction who had an otherwise clean record \u2013 but again at a cost.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b139e0a1c7661c7056d4bec8da91f59949e0443f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b139e0a1c7661c7056d4bec8da91f59949e0443f/0_0_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Police arrest anti-Brexit demonstrators during a sit-down protest in London in August\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Police arrest anti-Brexit demonstrators during a sit-down protest in London in August.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alastair Grant/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>I was only arrested and let off with a caution \u2013 do I have to declare it?</strong></h2> <p>No, there is no obligation to tell your insurer or other financial company that you were arrested. If you accept a caution, that is considered to be immediately spent. However, it can have long-term consequences, as it stays on your police file for life \u2013 and will be likely to appear on any enhanced Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) check carried out later.</p> <h2><strong>What about my credit file, bank account and mortgage application?</strong></h2> <p>The credit reference agency Experian told us criminal fines and convictions have no impact on credit scores, and only a fraud conviction would show up as a \u201cmarker\u201d. Banks generally take a similar stance. Nationwide says it does not ask about criminal convictions when someone is opening an account. Only serious financial crimes such as money laundering, bribery, tax evasion or mortgage fraud would lead to account withdrawal, it adds.</p> <p>However, things become a bit murkier when it comes to mortgage applications, says Stacey at Unlock. Mortgage companies do ask about unspent convictions, and every year, the charity hears reports of people having their mortgage application seemingly turned down for this reason.</p> <p>Stacey says most lenders will ask about criminal records \u2013 typically: \u201cHave you ever been convicted, or have any prosecutions pending for any criminal offence (other than motoring offences)?\u201d Under the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974, spent convictions do not have to be disclosed as part of a mortgage application, irrespective of what questions are asked. Mortgage companies should be clear about this, but often aren\u2019t, he says.</p> <p>If your conviction is unspent, you will need to disclose it.</p> <h2><strong>Do I need to tell my existing employer?</strong></h2> <p>Ruby Dinsmore, an employment law specialist at Slater and Gordon, says: \u201cStrictly speaking, employees are under no legal obligation to tell their boss if they have been arrested or charged with an offence, but there are exceptions. For example, if their contract of employment states that they must disclose such matters, or the conviction affects their ability to do the job, such as a taxi driver banned from driving, or if they work in certain regulated professions.\u201d</p> <p>She says honesty is usually the best policy, as the consequences could be much worse if an employer were to find out at a later stage.</p> <p>\u201cWhile information about arrests is not publicly available \u2013 unless an employer were to carry out an enhanced background check \u2013 details of charges and convictions are,\u201d Dinsmore says.</p> <p>\u201cAnd if the employer decided that their trust had been broken, that the person\u2019s behaviour posed a threat to colleagues or customers or had brought the business into disrepute, they could be within their rights to dismiss them, even before the outcome of any criminal case.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>What about future employment and the DBS check?</strong></h2> <p>For many younger protesters, this will be the biggest issue, particularly if they decide to change career.</p> <p>Most big employers conduct a basic DBS check before they offer a new employee a contract. This will show up only unspent convictions and conditional cautions, which will not be a problem for most first-time environmental protesters.</p> <p>However, if you decide you want to work with children or vulnerable adults, even on a voluntary basis, and the organisation does an enhanced check, it will show all convictions \u2013 including spent ones \u2013 plus cautions and any other information the police deem to be relevant. Most cautions given to first-time Extinction Rebellion protesters would likely only come off their enhanced check after six years.</p> <p>It would then be up to the employer to decide whether to carry on. Would a caution following a climate protest lead to a teacher being denied a job offer?</p> <p>It is worth noting that plenty of people taking jobs in finance have been caught out after telling their employer they had no convictions, as they were spent, only to have the offer withdrawn when the employer did a DBS check. Arguably, as more people are arrested at climate protests, employers will have to stop lumping them in with every other convicted or cautioned person.</p> <h2><strong>Future travel or work abroad could be affected</strong></h2> <p>Generally, anyone travelling to the US for less than 90 days can travel under the visa waiver programme. However, if you have been arrested, you are ineligible to travel under the scheme, and will have to apply to the US embassy for a visa. A typical six-month conditional discharge given to a climate protester would probably not be grounds for a visa refusal, but the visa process can be a real pain. Equally, those planning to emigrate in later life will have to disclose any brushes with the law, and it could be a problem depending on the country.</p> <h2><strong>Case study: \u2018</strong>I think we were a little naive\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ab571d3be730b14d7c9075dd0f1c6f16c2863a1d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ab571d3be730b14d7c9075dd0f1c6f16c2863a1d/0_0_5120_3071/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Miranda Cox locked herself in specially made arm tubes to block the entrance to Quadrilla\u2019s fracking site in New Preston Road, Lancashire\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Miranda Cox locked herself in specially made arm tubes to block the entrance to Quadrilla\u2019s fracking site in New Preston Road, Lancashire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kristian Buus/In Pictures /Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Miranda Cox, who was one of a number of people arrested after locking themselves to the entrance to Cuadrilla\u2019s fracking site near Blackpool, says environmental protesters need to go into the process with their eyes open.</p> <p>Along with 11 others, she pleaded not guilty in 2017 to obstructing the highway, but was convicted. They each received a 12-month conditional discharge and had to pay a total of \u00a3270 in costs.</p> <p>\u201cLooking back on it, I think we were a little naive about the consequences. We knew we wouldn\u2019t be visiting America any time soon but we didn\u2019t really think about the other consequences. I think we were lucky that most of us were a bit older and we weren\u2019t about to make big career changes or similar,\u201d says Cox, 50, who was a councillor at the time.</p> <p>She says she did not have insurance problems but others in the group have faced rises in car premiums. No one lost their job, she says, but she suspects that was more due to their circumstances.</p> <p>\u201cTo anyone thinking of joining an environmental protest I\u2019d say go for it, as you will be on the right side of history. However, you need to go into it with your eyes open. Being handcuffed and thrown in the back of a police van and spending several hours in a police cell was really unpleasant \u2013 much worse than I thought it would be,\u201d she says.</p>",

Extinction Rebellion launched a wave of civil disobedience on 7 October to highlight the escalating climate emergency, and by yesterday, more than 1,700 people \u2013 including the Guardian columnist George Monbiot \u2013 had been arrested, with some now facing an anxious wait to find out what comes next. Guardian Money has spent the week looking at the possible financial implications of being arrested in this type of protest, and talked to lawyers, experts and those who have put themselves on the line for environmental causes.

Prosecutions can lead to unspent convictions and \u2013 while that might sound technical \u2013 it is these that can cause the biggest problems. Extinction Rebellion does not duck this issue on its website, which has downloads and FAQs covering this area. \u201cBefore attending an action, it\u2019s crucial that all rebels inform themselves about their rights as protesters and the possible consequences of arrest,\u201d it says. This article is not designed to put anyone off participating in protests. The aim is to clearly spell out the implications that being arrested could have so individuals can make an informed choice. Unspent convictions A criminal conviction can be for anything from a serious crime resulting in a prison sentence to littering or speeding leading to a fine. It is likely that in the case of most of those charged this week, it will be for failing to leave a controlled area of London when instructed to do so by a police officer. Once someone has been convicted, that conviction is deemed to be current \u2013 or unspent \u2013 for a period based on the sentence. The more serious the conviction, the longer it remains unspent. In short, convictions are what insurers, mortgage companies, employers and other organisations do not want to see on your \u201cfile\u201d. For example, British Heart Foundation does not accept volunteers to work in its shops if they have any type of unspent conviction. John Briant, an Oxford-based criminal barrister who has been advising local Extinction Rebellion protesters about the implications of being arrested, says most of those previously arrested who chose to go to court have ended up with a conditional discharge of six months and/or a fine related to income. Conditional discharges are only considered to be spent at the end of that term \u2013 typically six or nine months. For those who are fined in court, the conviction is only considered to be spent a year from conviction. Those given a community order face a year on top of the order\u2019s length. The extraordinary 15-month prison sentences meted out to anti-fracking protesters are a much bigger problem, as the conviction is not considered spent for a further four years on top of the sentence. Home insurance It may sound ridiculous, but a 70-year-old retired teacher who may have never claimed on their home insurance is unlikely to have their policy renewed once they reveal they have an unspent conviction. Christopher Stacey, a co-director of the charity Unlock, which was set up 20 years ago to help people with all types of convictions, says most big insurers will not renew, or issue a new household policy, when they learn someone in the insured household has an unspent conviction. Several insurers including Direct Line, LV= and Aviva told Money this was the case. \u201cGetting insurance can be a big problem for people with an unspent conviction. For those with existing house insurance, if you don\u2019t notify them of the change when you next renew, the firm could refuse to pay out if you later try to claim. We have seen this happen in the past, particularly when people have let their policy simply automatically renew,\u201d he says. Convicted protesters given a six-month conditional discharge would be fine if their renewal came up after it was considered spent. However, if it fell within the six months, it would be unlikely to be renewed \u2013 if you admit it. Unlock has produced a list of specialist brokers who will help those with an unspent conviction find insurance cover, but this is likely to come at a cost. Some insurers have a clause in their terms and conditions that requires the customer to inform them of a conviction, at any time. One of the UK\u2019s largest, Aviva, told Money it insists customers inform it of any new non-motoring convictions \u201cas soon as reasonably possible\u201d. It admits it could lead to a decline or cancellation of the policy, either at the time or at the point of renewal. As soon as your conviction is spent, you have no obligation to mention it to an insurer. The Unlock calculator can help with this. Car insurance Car insurers are not so obsessed with non-motoring convictions unless they are serious and relate to theft, fraud or handling stolen goods. Again, you will have to declare any unspent convictions at renewal. However, Aviva said it would insure a driver with a minor protest conviction who had an otherwise clean record \u2013 but again at a cost. I was only arrested and let off with a caution \u2013 do I have to declare it? No, there is no obligation to tell your insurer or other financial company that you were arrested. If you accept a caution, that is considered to be immediately spent. However, it can have long-term consequences, as it stays on your police file for life \u2013 and will be likely to appear on any enhanced Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) check carried out later. What about my credit file, bank account and mortgage application? The credit reference agency Experian told us criminal fines and convictions have no impact on credit scores, and only a fraud conviction would show up as a \u201cmarker\u201d. Banks generally take a similar stance. Nationwide says it does not ask about criminal convictions when someone is opening an account. Only serious financial crimes such as money laundering, bribery, tax evasion or mortgage fraud would lead to account withdrawal, it adds. However, things become a bit murkier when it comes to mortgage applications, says Stacey at Unlock. Mortgage companies do ask about unspent convictions, and every year, the charity hears reports of people having their mortgage application seemingly turned down for this reason. Stacey says most lenders will ask about criminal records \u2013 typically: \u201cHave you ever been convicted, or have any prosecutions pending for any criminal offence (other than motoring offences)?\u201d Under the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974, spent convictions do not have to be disclosed as part of a mortgage application, irrespective of what questions are asked. Mortgage companies should be clear about this, but often aren\u2019t, he says. If your conviction is unspent, you will need to disclose it. Do I need to tell my existing employer? Ruby Dinsmore, an employment law specialist at Slater and Gordon, says: \u201cStrictly speaking, employees are under no legal obligation to tell their boss if they have been arrested or charged with an offence, but there are exceptions. For example, if their contract of employment states that they must disclose such matters, or the conviction affects their ability to do the job, such as a taxi driver banned from driving, or if they work in certain regulated professions.\u201d She says honesty is usually the best policy, as the consequences could be much worse if an employer were to find out at a later stage. \u201cWhile information about arrests is not publicly available \u2013 unless an employer were to carry out an enhanced background check \u2013 details of charges and convictions are,\u201d Dinsmore says. \u201cAnd if the employer decided that their trust had been broken, that the person\u2019s behaviour posed a threat to colleagues or customers or had brought the business into disrepute, they could be within their rights to dismiss them, even before the outcome of any criminal case.\u201d What about future employment and the DBS check? For many younger protesters, this will be the biggest issue, particularly if they decide to change career. Most big employers conduct a basic DBS check before they offer a new employee a contract. This will show up only unspent convictions and conditional cautions, which will not be a problem for most first-time environmental protesters. However, if you decide you want to work with children or vulnerable adults, even on a voluntary basis, and the organisation does an enhanced check, it will show all convictions \u2013 including spent ones \u2013 plus cautions and any other information the police deem to be relevant. Most cautions given to first-time Extinction Rebellion protesters would likely only come off their enhanced check after six years. It would then be up to the employer to decide whether to carry on. Would a caution following a climate protest lead to a teacher being denied a job offer? It is worth noting that plenty of people taking jobs in finance have been caught out after telling their employer they had no convictions, as they were spent, only to have the offer withdrawn when the employer did a DBS check. Arguably, as more people are arrested at climate protests, employers will have to stop lumping them in with every other convicted or cautioned person. Future travel or work abroad could be affected Generally, anyone travelling to the US for less than 90 days can travel under the visa waiver programme. However, if you have been arrested, you are ineligible to travel under the scheme, and will have to apply to the US embassy for a visa. A typical six-month conditional discharge given to a climate protester would probably not be grounds for a visa refusal, but the visa process can be a real pain. Equally, those planning to emigrate in later life will have to disclose any brushes with the law, and it could be a problem depending on the country. Case study: \u2018I think we were a little naive\u2019 Miranda Cox, who was one of a number of people arrested after locking themselves to the entrance to Cuadrilla\u2019s fracking site near Blackpool, says environmental protesters need to go into the process with their eyes open. Along with 11 others, she pleaded not guilty in 2017 to obstructing the highway, but was convicted. They each received a 12-month conditional discharge and had to pay a total of \u00a3270 in costs. \u201cLooking back on it, I think we were a little naive about the consequences. We knew we wouldn\u2019t be visiting America any time soon but we didn\u2019t really think about the other consequences. I think we were lucky that most of us were a bit older and we weren\u2019t about to make big career changes or similar,\u201d says Cox, 50, who was a councillor at the time. She says she did not have insurance problems but others in the group have faced rises in car premiums. No one lost their job, she says, but she suspects that was more due to their circumstances. \u201cTo anyone thinking of joining an environmental protest I\u2019d say go for it, as you will be on the right side of history. However, you need to go into it with your eyes open. Being handcuffed and thrown in the back of a police van and spending several hours in a police cell was really unpleasant \u2013 much worse than I thought it would be,\u201d she says.",

This was at the request of Prime Minister Boris Johnson.\u201d</p> \n<p>Sacoolas\u2019 lawyer, Amy Jeffress, said in a statement: \u201cAnne is devastated by this tragic accident. No loss compares to the death of a child and Anne extends her deepest sympathy to Harry Dunn\u2019s family.\u201d</p> \n<p>But after the whirlwind week the Dunns themselves are simply stunned.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe are bemused by all of it,\u201d Tim Dunn said of their time in the US. \u201cWe still can\u2019t believe how the story is moving on.

      "bodyText": "When the grieving parents of British teenager Harry Dunn arrived in New York earlier this week, their fight for justice for their dead son quickly became a whirlwind of interviews. Their press tour took a strange turn on Tuesday, however, when family adviser Radd Seiger received an unexpected invitation to Washington DC. \u201cRadd, who\u2019s been looking after us, has a phone call from the White House saying: \u2018Could you please come to the White House as soon as possible?\u2019\u201d Tim Dunn, Harry\u2019s father, said. \u201cWe got on a train, and away we went.\u201d It was the start of a bizarre trip to visit Donald Trump that plunged the grieving Dunns briefly into the weird world of White House politics, as the US president and his team appeared keen on pulling a reality TV-style stunt on them \u2013 by brokering a meeting with the woman who killed their child. Dunn, 19, was killed this August in a head-on collision between his motorcycle and a car traveling on the wrong side of the road. The alleged driver of that car, Anne Sacoolas, is the wife of a US intelligence officer; she claimed diplomatic immunity and subsequently fled back to the US. Dunn\u2019s parents want Sacoolas to return to the UK and cooperate with investigators. They hoped their trip to the US would bring attention to his tragic death, as media coverage in the US has been overshadowed by the impeachment inquiry. \u201cHe was very, very special, big-hearted boy,\u201d said his mother, Charlotte Charles, saying he had many friends and a keen \u201cinstinct to know when you needed an extra hug\u201d. \u201cIt was very hard to get mad with him,\u201d she said, even when \u201cyou felt like you needed to sometimes \u2013 especially when he left his room in such a mess\u201d. Tim Dunn described him as an \u201caccomplished\u201d motorbike rider who would chat with his parents after a long workday, before going out for a ride. When Dunn\u2019s family accepted the White House invitation, they were neither informed it was a meeting with Trump nor that Sacoolas would be there in the next room \u2013 let alone that Trump would thrice urge them to meet with her, they said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t actually until we were halfway there, I think, that we realized it was a senior official,\u201d Charles recalled. \u201cWe just went with it.

Even when we got into the White House, they were trying little tricks to separate us,\u201d Tim Dunn said. Charles said Seiger \u2019s identification was extensively scrutinized and, at one point, he was taken to a separate room. \u201cProbably, they thought they could soften us up to actually go through with the plan they had put together,\u201d Charles said of the seeming attempts at separating them from Seiger. \ufeffWhen they were ultimately brought into the Oval Office, Trump was standing there to greet them. He \u201cwas welcoming\u201d, inviting them to sit on the sofas. \u201cHe shook our hands and they were firm handshakes \u2013 not some limp ones that you do get sometimes,\u201d Charles said. \u201cHe said: \u2018I recognize you off the TV,\u2019 he shook my hand,\u201d Tim Dunn said. There was a photographer with two cameras and about eight other people in the room. One of those people was Robert O\u2019Brien, Trump\u2019s national security adviser, Dunn\u2019s parents said. A few minutes into the meeting, Trump said: \u201cWe have her here in the White House\u201d \u2013 referring to Sacoolas. They refused to meet her, holding to their position that they would sit down with Sacoolas, but not on US soil and only with lawyers and other mediators present. \u201cRadd said to the president: \u2018No, Mr President, our terms are we meet in the UK,\u2019\u201d Tim Dunn said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s when Mr O\u2019Brien said: \u2018She is never going back to the UK.\u2019 \u201cHe was quite abrupt and sharp with his tone.\u201d Trump put his hand up \u201cto make [O\u2019Brien] calm down\u201d, Tim Dunn said. \u201cHe was just very aggressive with his nature of speak[ing], made himself look as big and tall as he possibly could, sat straight bolt upright and forward,\u201d Charles said of O\u2019Brien. Charles said she then spoke to Trump for about five minutes. \u201cHe didn\u2019t attempt to interrupt me, he held my eye contact \u2026 kept very calm,\u201d she said. Trump unsuccessfully tried two more times to get Dunn\u2019s family to meet with Sacoolas, they claimed. \u201cIt was quite obvious we were going around in circles,\u201d Charles said. The White House said in an email when the family declined to meet with Sacoolas, \u201cno one asked again\u201d and that \u201cno one in that room was aggressive. It was a quiet and respectful meeting.\u201d As they were leaving, Trump extended his hand to her. \u201cI took it very tightly and just said to him: \u2018Please, please try to understand \u2026 I\u2019m sure if it was your son you\u2019d be doing the same,\u2019\u201d Charles recalled. \u201cAnd he agreed with me and said \u2018absolutely, I would be\u2019, and he said that \u2018maybe I\u2019ll now try and push to have this looked at from a different angle\u2019. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what to think about that,\u201d she reflected. \u201cWe came out feeling that we\u2019d gotten our story through and to have him say that meant something at the time, but unless he carries it through and sticks to his word, then we\u2019re going to gain nothing from that, are we?\u201d And while Trump is a former reality television host, Charles said his suggestion that they meet with Sacoolas didn\u2019t come across as him attempting a made-for-TV moment. \u201cIt felt genuine at the time, although we were not impressed with the fact that obviously, we had it sprung on us that she was there,\u201d she said. \u201cFor all we know, she might have been watching us on a TV camera in the other room. We have absolutely no idea.\u201d \u201cThe president met with members of the Dunn family to personally offer his condolences for the loss of their son,\u201d the White House said in a statement about the controversial meeting. \u201cHis intent was to do all he could to comfort the victims of a tragic accident. This was at the request of Prime Minister Boris Johnson.\u201d Sacoolas\u2019 lawyer, Amy Jeffress, said in a statement: \u201cAnne is devastated by this tragic accident. No loss compares to the death of a child and Anne extends her deepest sympathy to Harry Dunn\u2019s family.\u201d But after the whirlwind week the Dunns themselves are simply stunned. \u201cWe are bemused by all of it,\u201d Tim Dunn said of their time in the US. \u201cWe still can\u2019t believe how the story is moving on. We come to the USA just to try and get our story across and then within two days, we\u2019re in the White House. \u201cFor us,\u201d he continued, \u201cfrom the UK, from a small town, it\u2019s just hard for us to really comprehend and get an angle on it.\u201d They nonetheless comprehend the impact he had on their family and community during his too-short life and tell stories of their son\u2019s generosity of spirit. One recent Remembrance Day, Dunn had arrived home only to find out that those selling poppies had already been to their home. \u201cHe actually got back on his motorbike and went and found the people who were selling these poppies and put money in the box as a donation,\u201d Charles said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have to do that.\u201d The children in their town, who grew accustomed to seeing Dunn wave at them from his motorbike without fail, have also felt his loss. \u201cThose children, we\u2019ve had messages from their parents saying that they\u2019re even missing Harry,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019d wait for his motorbike to come up the road, and it doesn\u2019t come.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "It was billed as \u201cfar and away\u201d the best venue when the acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney declared that Donald Trump had awarded next year\u2019s G7 summit to the president\u2019s own luxury golf resort in Florida. Yet buried in the ballyhoo of the extraordinary announcement was an even more surprising revelation (or maybe not): nobody had bothered informing the locals. The city of Doral and its police department that will supposedly host and protect world leaders and their entourages at US taxpayers\u2019 expense were caught on the hop by the proclamation. So too were the Miami-Dade police department, and the senior officials of the county\u2019s tourism bureau, who usually have the job of securing blocks of hotel rooms when events of such international importance come to town. Mulvaney told reporters at a rare White House press briefing on camera, on Thursday afternoon, that the administration selected Trump\u2019s resort after initially looking at about 12 potential locations in various other US states. \u201cDoral was by far and away the best physical facility for this meeting. It\u2019s almost like they built this facility to host this event,\u201d he said. It appears that only Carlos Gim\u00e9nez, the Republican mayor of Miami-Dade county, received any kind of heads-up, and that a quick phone call from the White House office of intergovernmental affairs barely 45 minutes before Mulvaney took the podium, according to an assistant. \u201cI did not know it was going to be announced,\u201d said Juan Carlos Bermudez, the mayor of the city of Doral. \u201cWe had a conversation with the White House in late June, a very brief one, on the possibility of this coming to Doral but I did not receive a phone call before the announcement. I found out just like you found out.\u201d That is, via the live televised briefing. Similarly, the Miami-Dade police department, the largest law enforcement agency in the south-eastern US, had also been out of the loop. \u201cNada. Zilch,\u201d the spokesperson Alvaro Zabaleta told the Miami Herald when the newspaper asked what advance notice had been received. Zabaleta\u2019s colleague, detective Angel Rodriguez, admitted to the Guardian on Friday: \u201cWe don\u2019t have a whole lot of information right now. As the weeks go by, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be getting more.\u201d Meanwhile William Talbert, the head of the Greater Miami convention and visitors bureau that will play a lead role in accommodating tens of thousands of fans for next year\u2019s American football Super Bowl, was another who found out from television news. He told the Herald he had not checked to see what other events might be on in Miami at the same time as the G7, at the Trump National resort in Doral, from 10 to 12 June, 2020. The suddenness of the announcement raised concerns over security, with some experts doubting the authenticity of the selection process the White House said it followed to find a venue, or whether the 800-acre, 643-room facility had received an appropriate federal security vetting. The Secret Service, which would be responsible for such a review, did not return an inquiry from the Guardian. The decision to host the event at his own resort has also led to accusations that Trump will profit personally, an allegation Mulvaney denied. In May it was revealed that Trump\u2019s profits from Doral had plummeted, while this summer the president was forced to deny reports that the resort was infested by bed bugs. Bermudez, the Doral mayor, said his city would now be working closely with the Secret Service and White House to prepare for the event, and had already switched more than $300,000 in city funds to pay for police overtime and equipment and other resources he said would be needed. He also said he hoped Trump would rethink a decision to keep any discussion of the climate crisis off the G7 agenda. \u201cWhen you have an opportunity for a summit of this type, there\u2019s a valid argument to discuss all the issues that impact not only us but the six other countries and the world,\u201d he said. \u201cClimate change is an important issue to us in south Florida and Doral.

This work is at an early stage, but includes looking at what constitutes serious disruption, and how Sections 12 and 14 of the Public Order Act may be more aligned.

Such a change would mean that the prospect of \u201cdisruption\u201d is enough to impose tough conditions, not \u201cserious disruption\u201d as the public order act currently states.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/18/extinction-rebellions-right-to-protest-must-be-respected\">Extinction Rebellion\u2019s right to protest must be respected | Letters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The source said government wanted to see more robust and proactive action from police: \u201cThey want \u2018move forward\u2019 tactics and to see the police are doing something and clearing the streets. Government wants police to be more robust earlier and more often.\u201d</p> <p>But civil rights lawyer Jules Carey, who is representing XR protesters, denounced any attempt to secure new powers for the police.</p> <p>\u201cThe spectre of the government now giving itself the power to prohibit all protests across the city would amount to a shocking assault on the right to protest,\u201d said Carey.</p> <p>\u201cIt would be in breach of the UK\u2019s obligations to uphold and protect the right to protest under international law and would set an appalling precedent that would be cheerily welcomed by authoritarian states throughout the world.\u201d</p> <p>The attempt to introduce new police powers came as the Met said more than 1,700 people had been arrested for taking part in the XR protests.</p> <p>Thousands of people have blocked roads, glued themselves to government buildings and blockaded big financial institutions to raise the alarm about the escalating climate emergency. One group targeted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/17/extinction-rebellion-activists-london-underground\">London\u2019s underground network</a>.</p> <p>Organisers say that a record number of people \u2013 up to 30,000 \u2013 took part over the two weeks. And data analysts within the group are already looking at which actions were most successful at sparking public support or resulted in new members signing up.</p> <p>But key figures within XR acknowledged there are serious challenges facing the movement as it reflects on the last two weeks.</p> <p>There have been fears raised that the recent activism did not cut through in the same way it had in April \u2013 as environmental civil disobedience and mass arrests \u201cbecame normalised.\u201d</p> <p>That changed on Monday evening when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/14/police-ban-extinction-rebellion-protests-from-whole-of-london\">police imposed a blanket ban on XR protests across the capital.</a> That proved a boost for those on the streets with support from civil liberties groups and politicians who branded the move \u201cchilling and unlawful\u201d.</p> <p>But that high was short-lived.

      "bodyText": "Government and police have held talks to strengthen public order laws to allow a tougher crackdown on future Extinction Rebellion (XR) climate demonstrations in what civil rights lawyers warn would be a \u201ca shocking assault on the right to protest.\u201d The move, which comes as XR\u2019s two-week \u201cuprising\u201d drew to a close on Friday, follows widespread criticism of the Metropolitan police after officers implemented a city wide ban on the protests earlier this week. Talks have been ongoing for months between police chiefs and the Home Office with changes to specific sections of the 1986 Public Order Act being discussed. The officer in charge of policing the demonstrations, deputy assistant commissioner Laurence Taylor, said: \u201cWe have been engaged with the Home Office around a number of asks in relation to the legislation. This work is at an early stage, but includes looking at what constitutes serious disruption, and how Sections 12 and 14 of the Public Order Act may be more aligned. This will require further engagement with the Home Office and NPCC [national police chiefs council] Public Order Lead.\u201d One senior police source said changes could include lowering the threshold at which police can place restrictions. Such a change would mean that the prospect of \u201cdisruption\u201d is enough to impose tough conditions, not \u201cserious disruption\u201d as the public order act currently states. The source said government wanted to see more robust and proactive action from police: \u201cThey want \u2018move forward\u2019 tactics and to see the police are doing something and clearing the streets. Government wants police to be more robust earlier and more often.\u201d But civil rights lawyer Jules Carey, who is representing XR protesters, denounced any attempt to secure new powers for the police. \u201cThe spectre of the government now giving itself the power to prohibit all protests across the city would amount to a shocking assault on the right to protest,\u201d said Carey. \u201cIt would be in breach of the UK\u2019s obligations to uphold and protect the right to protest under international law and would set an appalling precedent that would be cheerily welcomed by authoritarian states throughout the world.\u201d The attempt to introduce new police powers came as the Met said more than 1,700 people had been arrested for taking part in the XR protests. Thousands of people have blocked roads, glued themselves to government buildings and blockaded big financial institutions to raise the alarm about the escalating climate emergency. One group targeted London\u2019s underground network. Organisers say that a record number of people \u2013 up to 30,000 \u2013 took part over the two weeks. And data analysts within the group are already looking at which actions were most successful at sparking public support or resulted in new members signing up. But key figures within XR acknowledged there are serious challenges facing the movement as it reflects on the last two weeks. There have been fears raised that the recent activism did not cut through in the same way it had in April \u2013 as environmental civil disobedience and mass arrests \u201cbecame normalised.\u201d That changed on Monday evening when police imposed a blanket ban on XR protests across the capital. That proved a boost for those on the streets with support from civil liberties groups and politicians who branded the move \u201cchilling and unlawful\u201d. But that high was short-lived. On Thursday morning a small group of activists targeted the tube network prompting a violent backlash from commuters. The action also prompted a split among XR supporters, with some complaining it was counter productive, had alienated ordinary working people and had gone ahead against the wishes of the majority of supporters. Others saw the fallout differently. They argued that the scale of the climate crisis requires the disruption of \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d to create \u201cbreakthrough moments that force people to engage with the reality of the climate crisis\u201d. This divergence of opinion points to a fundamental challenge facing the group. Many of its founders and early supporters believe that only radical, disruptive \u2013 and sometimes polarising \u2013 action resulting in mass arrests and imprisonment will raise the alarm about climate emergency and bring about the political transformation required. Others, who have joined since its launch just 12 months ago, come from different political traditions with alternative \u201ctheories of change\u201d. The challenge of accommodating these differing views on tactics and strategy was acknowledged in a note sent out to XR activists after Thursday\u2019s tube protest. \u201cOur world is in grave danger \u2026 We\u2019re still figuring out how to work together to prevent or mitigate catastrophe, but in the meantime let\u2019s not forget the love that brings us together \u2026 Moving forwards will bring challenges \u2013 it was always going to. But let\u2019s remember why we\u2019re here.\u201d Asked how the two weeks of protest had gone, a well-placed source in XR said: \u201cIt\u2019s too early to tell in some ways \u2013 we are in the midst of it still.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s something about being in XR which is about facing your grief or allowing that to be part of your daily emotion.\u201d They added: \u201cThursday was a bad day, the day before was a great day. Today feels strong and for sure there\u2019s much we have to learn \u2026 will keep learning, we are not a static movement that thinks it\u2019s got the answer, we are just trying to do something.\u201d Out on the streets on Friday XR activists continued to sound the alarm about the climate crisis. Charlie Lewin, 54, was crying as she handed out leaflets to passersby at Oxford Circus that read: \u201cWe\u2019re sorry.\u201d \u201cPeople are really angry and want us to go away and I want to go home, but I have to be here,\u201d Lewin said. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen my family for a fortnight, I miss my family \u2026 I don\u2019t want to be arrested again but I\u2019m terrified for my future and my family\u2019s future.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "What motivates Donald Trump\u2019s political base, a major factor behind the silences and squirms of Republican officials these days? Dissections of what the president\u2019s mass of supporters thinks, feels and perceives have pointed to their vanished jobs, stagnant incomes and precariously low savings; their ideological commitments to conservative judges, lower taxes and nationalist foreign policy; and their abhorrence of a Washington establishment said to run roughshod over their cultural traditions and racial preferences. Deep, sharp partisan loyalties cement the bond, burnished by bulletins from @realdonaldtrump, Fox News and similarly attuned voices. To this assay of the Trump base\u2019s psychological composition, Gwyneth H McClendon would have us add its members\u2019 sense of where they stand socially among their peers. People tend to envy neighbors who have more than they do, to spite those who have less, and to crave local admiration. These emotions, McClendon shows through elaborate data analysis, have the power to get people to take political positions at odds with their material interests. The envious, the spiteful and the seekers of recognition will sacrifice time, money and even personal safety \u2013 McClendon focuses on protesters in one of her case studies \u2013 in order to satisfy their urges. Her big insight is that the seething and yearning focuses not on class conflict, but the Joneses. That is, while emotional cues may come from national voices, it\u2019s the people nextdoor who churn minds to the point where their bodies will clamber into the arenas of politics. When the folks down the street happen to be immigrants or of different color, I would dare to add, the aggravation increases. Parsing the emotional contents of political movements (the emotion-movement word echo is deliberate) traces back, as do so many topics, to Aristotle. His psychological analysis in Book II of On Rhetoric was geared toward enhancing persuasive power; he discussed emotions in pairs, with anger and calm up first and envy and emulation at the end. This dichotomous approach is invaluable for political practitioners, a guide to parsing leaders\u2019 speeches and constructing counter-demagogic strategies. Civility is a virtue but not a counter-strategy, as anyone who has ever tried to calm an angry person by telling him to calm down knows. Contemporary philosophers of political emotion have taken up the question of what to do about the envious. Martha Nussbaum has prescribed a \u201cmandatory program of youth national civil service\u201d of three years\u2019 duration. John Rawls argued that strengthening the proverbial social safety net could mitigate these feelings. Judith Shklar proposed that status should be publicly awarded on multiple dimensions of comparison so more may benefit. McClendon cites these and other philosophers but offers no remedies of her own, focusing her last chapter instead on sketching out a fuller research program. Although I wouldn\u2019t make it mandatory, Nussbaum\u2019s idea sounds right to me, in that it would award people badges for working with their neighbors and thus diverting them from stewing about their possessions. Among the viable presidential candidates at this writing, Pete Buttigieg\u2019s public service program stands out on this score. His plan calls for developing a Climate Corps, a Community Health Corps and a Inter-generational Service Corps. Service fellows would be considered for student debt forgiveness, hiring preference and vocational training. The Peace Corps stamps souls for a lifetime, as a conversation with any alum will demonstrate. Public service programs can make a base more noble.",

      "body": "<h2><strong>\u2018The biggest achievement of the anti-abortion lobby is making women feel guilty\u2019<br></strong></h2> <p><strong>Sam</strong><strong>, 26, and Diane Munday, 88, </strong><strong>had abortions five decades apart</strong></p> <p>Sam and Diane are sitting in Diane\u2019s front room in Hertfordshire, hands warmed by mugs of coffee, chatting as if they are old friends. In fact, they have just met, brought together by their similar personal and political experiences, which took place some 50 years apart.</p> <p>\u201cBack in the 1960s, nobody talked about abortion. It was a word that was never said, never written,\u201d says Diane. When her dressmaker and friend, married with three young children, died from a backstreet abortion, \u201cit knocked me between the eyes,\u201d she says. She thought of her again when, married with three children herself, she became pregnant at 29: \u201cI knew the minute that pregnancy was confirmed that I wasn\u2019t going to continue with it. I had reached my limit in my circumstances.\u201d</p> <p>Her choice, in 1961, was between an illegal abortion, and paying a doctor to say that a legal termination was necessary for health reasons; she opted for the latter. Diane\u2019s abortion took place on Harley Street in London. \u201cOddly, I came round from the anaesthetic remembering the young woman who died. She was dead and I was alive because my husband and I, borrowing from my mother, could afford an abortion. I said to myself: \u2018I will fight for other women to have the privilege of being able to control their own fertility.\u2019\u201d Diane went on to play a key role in helping to change the law: \u201cAnd here you see me, aged 88, still fighting.\u201d</p> <p>She turns to Sam: \u201cSo tell me about your experience.\u201d Sam explains, that after she suffered terrible side-effects from hormonal contraception she and her then-boyfriend tried natural family planning, which failed. \u201cThe first time I was pregnant, two years ago, I was terrified. I didn\u2019t have a stable relationship, a good job, a proper home I could raise a child in. I was too young.\u201d Diane responds, softly: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t right for you.\u201d</p> <p>Thanks to campaigners such as Diane, who fought for the Abortion Act 1967, Sam had a legal termination at a Marie Stopes clinic. \u201cI decided to have a surgical abortion under general anaesthetic because I was so afraid, but it was fine,\u201d she says. \u201cThe only time I really felt scared was going through to the operating theatre. I started to cry, and asked someone to hold my hand. Then I was out.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The first public meeting I spoke at in the 60s, I went in trembling. They were respectable ladies in hats and gloves</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThere\u2019s still a lot of silence. I found the silence so suffocating, I decided to talk about it on Twitter. I was scared of anti-choicers harassing me, but within a few hours at least 40 people had messaged me, giving their support. It was mostly women who\u2019d had abortions, saying they had never spoken about this before, that their family didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p> <p>Sam is shocked to hear that Diane had a similar experience, half a century earlier. She joined the Abortion Law Reform Association (now <a href=\"https://www.abortionrights.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Abortion Rights</a>), in 1962: \u201cThe first public meeting I spoke at, I went in trembling. They were respectable ladies wearing hats and gloves. I stood up and said, \u2018I have had an abortion.\u2019 During the tea interval these ladies came up to me, one after another, saying, \u2018You know dear, I had an abortion back in the 30s, I\u2019ve never told anybody before.\u2019 I wasn\u2019t alone.\u201d</p> <p>Despite Sam\u2019s openness, she still felt a sense of shame when she needed a second abortion after emergency contraception failed; by now, she says, \u201cI knew the relationship was not one that I could have a child within.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAgain, you made a responsible decision,\u201d Diane reassures her. \u201cI really think it\u2019s the biggest achievement of the anti-abortion lobby: making women feel guilty.\u201d</p> <p>Diane drank only half a glass of champagne when abortion was partially legalised in 1967, and is still waiting to drink another half glass: she says she will not rest until it is legal for everyone. Sam, who campaigns for Marie Stopes, agrees: \u201cThe only thing left now is for abortion to be taken out of criminal law and be treated as a healthcare issue across the UK, including Northern Ireland. It\u2019s for us to continue the work. I\u2019m so grateful that you all fought so hard for us to have those rights,\u201d she tells Diane.</p> <p>Diane smiles. \u201cThat makes me feel very happy. There are only a couple of us early pioneers left now \u2013 you\u2019ve got to carry that fight on for other women.\u201d</p> <p>Sam has tears rolling down her cheeks. \u201cDo you want another coffee?\u201d asks Diane, gently.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018We\u2019re hearing the exact same slurs and experiences as we did 40 years ago\u2019</strong></h2> <p><strong>Roxy Legane, 28, and Nona Ferdon, 91, civil rights activists</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"53fae661e841d28b2fd67509bf8d953f912acb64\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/53fae661e841d28b2fd67509bf8d953f912acb64/0_843_5674_4601/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Roxy Legane, 28, and Nona Ferdon, 91\" width=\"1000\" height=\"811\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018In the UK, we\u2019re good at covering up our racism\u2019: Roxy Legane and Nona Ferdon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kensington Leverne/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Midway through their conversation, Nona Ferdon proudly shows Roxy Legane photographs of her standing with Martin Luther King Jr, pictures that were taken on a march from Selma to Montgomery in 1965. Nona explains how, as a clinical psychologist working in Hawaii, she was part of a medical unit that joined the civil rights demonstration.</p> <p>\u201cThe atmosphere was very tense,\u201d she says. \u201cTwo weeks before, people had been stampeded with horses and policemen. We gathered around at a chapel, and it was the first time I heard We Shall Overcome. The second verse was: \u2018Black and white together, we shall overcome.\u2019 That was very much the feeling.\u201d Her eyes brighten as she talks.</p> <p>Five decades later, Roxy is battling racism \u2013 and, as a woman of colour, experiencing it. She works with anti-racist groups and runs the community project Kids of Colour in Manchester. Her own memories of racism go back to childhood. \u201cMy dad wasn\u2019t welcome at my mum\u2019s parents\u2019 house. He was from Mauritius, and they were white, and thought he couldn\u2019t provide what they wanted for her, and for me there was racism wrapped up in that. [Also] growing up in a predominantly white environment, being around lots of micro-aggressions.\u201d She tells Nona that progress feels slow. \u201cLast year I put on an event about racism in education, and a 13-year-old talked about his experiences of violence and restraint at school. Older people in the room were saying, \u2018We\u2019re hearing the same slurs and experiences that we heard 40 years ago.\u2019 That is shocking and frustrating.\u201d She describes being contacted by a mother whose seven-year-old, a mixed-race child, was spat at by a white child of the same age, and told she could not play with white children; and meeting young people of colour who, flattened by the oppression they face, say, \u201cI just want to be white.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You\u2019ve got to have someone you can sit down with and say, \u2018My God, you won\u2019t believe what he said to me\u2026'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Nona agrees that progress is slow. But, she says, \u201cThere have been tremendous changes in the US. I remember the day the Voting Rights Act was passed in 1965, people of colour circled around, block after block, trying to vote.\u201d Before this, they had been prevented from voting because they had failed impossible, deliberately obtuse literacy tests that included questions such as, How many bubbles in a bar of soap?, she explains. While Nona still feels the outlook is bleak, with Trump in the White House, she tells Roxy: \u201cPlease believe me, there have been such massive changes. If you could put your mind back into 1950 \u2013 it was a different world.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI feel aware of how far we\u2019ve come,\u201d Roxy says. \u201cBut similarly aware of how much there is to be done. In the UK, we\u2019re good at covering up our racism \u2013 but it can be seen in who is most likely to have poor housing, or be in the prison system, or unemployed, and that comes back to people of colour. We look at the US and think: how can they do that to migrant children? But we split up and destroy families here, too.\u201d</p> <p>When Roxy talks of how drained and helpless she can feel, Nona encourages her to talk, to take care of herself. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have someone you can sit down with and say, \u2018My God, you won\u2019t believe what he said to me\u2026\u2019\u201d She adds, \u201cI\u2019ve tried to teach my grandchildren this: every day you live is a footstep in tomorrow, and a brick in the person you want to be.\u201d</p> <p>Once the conversation has drawn to a close, Nona\u2019s daughter takes us to visit the 10 leonberger puppies they have bred. \u201cNow this is what I call self-care,\u201d says Roxy, as she holds one close.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018I was 19 and I\u2019d drive to work crying my eyes out\u2019<br></strong></h2> <p><strong>Alex Evans, 45, and Paul McGregor, 29, </strong><strong>lost their fathers to suicide, 18 years apart</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7502177c4a8eb3602dfc1ab289b9bde56fc69d75\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7502177c4a8eb3602dfc1ab289b9bde56fc69d75/0_965_5553_4560/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alex Evans, 45, and Paul McGregor, 29\" width=\"1000\" height=\"821\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018There was definitely a stigma\u2019: Alex Evans and Paul McGregor.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kensington Leverne/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When commercial manager Alex Evans, 45, meets entrepreneur Paul McGregor, 29, at the Guardian\u2019s offices, it looks from the outside like an ordinary business meeting, all handshakes and nice-to-meet-yous. But in the room there is a tension, as if we are all holding our breath.</p> <p>Paul, his voice steady, goes first. \u201cMy life was straightforward until I was about 18. I grew up in Essex with my parents and older brother. I was quite academic at school, played a lot of football. My mum and dad were childhood sweethearts. On the outside it looked like a happy family. But when I was 18, my dad just broke. His eyes were distant, he was saying things \u2013 we didn\u2019t know what to do.\u201d After taking antidepressants and being admitted to a psychiatric hospital, he killed himself on 4 March 2009, at the age of 45.</p> <p>Paul now tells his story at events to raise awareness of mental health issues; but Alex, from Sussex, has not spoken at length about his father\u2019s death before. \u201cMy family was broken,\u201d he begins. His father was an alcoholic, and in the year before his suicide he lost his driving licence, his job, and the phone was disconnected. He killed himself on 29 October 1991, aged 44, when Alex was away with friends.</p> <p>Before leaving for that trip, Alex says, \u201cI got home after my Saturday shift at McDonald\u2019s, and saw Dad asleep, slumped in the corner of the kitchen, absolutely paralytic, all the dirty dishes piled up. I tried to wake him and he went for me. He kneed me in the balls, tried to headbutt me.\u201d His brother broke up the fight. \u201cThe emotion broke. I was outside, crying and angry. Something inside snapped and I said, \u2018I\u2019m never going to cry about this again.\u2019\u201d His jaw clenches as he explains what happened next: his father tried to apologise, but Alex slammed the door and walked out. That was the last time they saw each other.</p> <p>Paul, the younger man, identifies the link between their experiences. \u201cI think you\u2019ve probably trained yourself not to show your emotions. But as you were talking, one emotion came through that I can relate to massively, and that\u2019s guilt. As you were talking about what you didn\u2019t do, I could see you starting to well up. It\u2019s the same with me.\u201d</p> <p>Both men spent their young adulthood hiding their grief. \u201cI was 19, and I\u2019d drive to work crying my eyes out,\u201d says Paul. \u201cThen I\u2019d get to work, and it was: \u2018Everyone all right?\u2019 and then I\u2019d get back in the car and cry.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Part of me thinks \u2013 even knows, deep down \u2013 that you never get over it. There\u2019s something about it that wrenches you</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cIn the year or two afterwards, I was the archetypal angry young man,\u201d says Alex. \u201cI had my head shaved, a big gold earring, I was like a red mist on a hair trigger. A lot of people saw this horrible man when I was out \u2013 and then I\u2019d be in bed weeping, with no one to offload on to.\u201d</p> <p>While Paul found a therapist, Alex has never felt able to. \u201cMy wife says, \u2018You\u2019re so unemotional, Alex.\u2019 She doesn\u2019t see that sometimes when she goes to bed, I get some old photo albums out, with the suicide letter. I can get quite weepy, and I feel very lucid in myself about my emotions. I can have a conversation with myself about how I feel. But when she walks in, I\u2019ll freeze. We have no secrets and I love her dearly, but I still find it hard to let go.\u201d</p> <p>Both agree that social attitudes around mental health have changed for the better \u2013 but not around suicide. \u201cThere was definitely a stigma,\u201d says Alex. \u201cI always joked about it: when people asked how he died, I\u2019d say, \u2018The usual way \u2013 he stopped breathing.\u2019 I used to hate myself for doing that.\u201d</p> <p>Paul thinks little had changed by 2009. \u201cI remember my dad saying \u2018Be careful near the local psychiatric hospital, because there\u2019s loads of loonies and nutters that might be round there,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cIf that\u2019s what he was conditioned to believe, then that\u2019s probably why he was silent for so long.\u201d</p> <p>When Paul asks how it felt this year to outlive the age at which his father died, Alex says that he felt as if a weight had been lifted. \u201cI\u2019ve almost found it\u2019s freed me up a bit. I\u2019m writing my own story now. I\u2019ve got past the point where he was, and it\u2019s uncharted territory.\u201d</p> <p>For Paul, it is talking that has been freeing. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019ve dealt with it \u2013 there are still times when it\u2019s horrible,\u201d he says. Alex agrees. \u201cPart of me thinks \u2013 even knows, deep down \u2013 that you never get over it. There\u2019s something about it that just wrenches you.

      "bodyText": "\u2018The biggest achievement of the anti-abortion lobby is making women feel guilty\u2019 Sam, 26, and Diane Munday, 88, had abortions five decades apart Sam and Diane are sitting in Diane\u2019s front room in Hertfordshire, hands warmed by mugs of coffee, chatting as if they are old friends. In fact, they have just met, brought together by their similar personal and political experiences, which took place some 50 years apart. \u201cBack in the 1960s, nobody talked about abortion. It was a word that was never said, never written,\u201d says Diane. When her dressmaker and friend, married with three young children, died from a backstreet abortion, \u201cit knocked me between the eyes,\u201d she says. She thought of her again when, married with three children herself, she became pregnant at 29: \u201cI knew the minute that pregnancy was confirmed that I wasn\u2019t going to continue with it. I had reached my limit in my circumstances.\u201d Her choice, in 1961, was between an illegal abortion, and paying a doctor to say that a legal termination was necessary for health reasons; she opted for the latter. Diane\u2019s abortion took place on Harley Street in London. \u201cOddly, I came round from the anaesthetic remembering the young woman who died. She was dead and I was alive because my husband and I, borrowing from my mother, could afford an abortion. I said to myself: \u2018I will fight for other women to have the privilege of being able to control their own fertility.\u2019\u201d Diane went on to play a key role in helping to change the law: \u201cAnd here you see me, aged 88, still fighting.\u201d She turns to Sam: \u201cSo tell me about your experience.\u201d Sam explains, that after she suffered terrible side-effects from hormonal contraception she and her then-boyfriend tried natural family planning, which failed. \u201cThe first time I was pregnant, two years ago, I was terrified. I didn\u2019t have a stable relationship, a good job, a proper home I could raise a child in. I was too young.\u201d Diane responds, softly: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t right for you.\u201d Thanks to campaigners such as Diane, who fought for the Abortion Act 1967, Sam had a legal termination at a Marie Stopes clinic. \u201cI decided to have a surgical abortion under general anaesthetic because I was so afraid, but it was fine,\u201d she says. \u201cThe only time I really felt scared was going through to the operating theatre. I started to cry, and asked someone to hold my hand. Then I was out. \u201cThere\u2019s still a lot of silence. I found the silence so suffocating, I decided to talk about it on Twitter. I was scared of anti-choicers harassing me, but within a few hours at least 40 people had messaged me, giving their support. It was mostly women who\u2019d had abortions, saying they had never spoken about this before, that their family didn\u2019t know.\u201d Sam is shocked to hear that Diane had a similar experience, half a century earlier. She joined the Abortion Law Reform Association (now Abortion Rights), in 1962: \u201cThe first public meeting I spoke at, I went in trembling. They were respectable ladies wearing hats and gloves. I stood up and said, \u2018I have had an abortion.\u2019 During the tea interval these ladies came up to me, one after another, saying, \u2018You know dear, I had an abortion back in the 30s, I\u2019ve never told anybody before.\u2019 I wasn\u2019t alone.\u201d Despite Sam\u2019s openness, she still felt a sense of shame when she needed a second abortion after emergency contraception failed; by now, she says, \u201cI knew the relationship was not one that I could have a child within.\u201d \u201cAgain, you made a responsible decision,\u201d Diane reassures her. \u201cI really think it\u2019s the biggest achievement of the anti-abortion lobby: making women feel guilty.\u201d Diane drank only half a glass of champagne when abortion was partially legalised in 1967, and is still waiting to drink another half glass: she says she will not rest until it is legal for everyone. Sam, who campaigns for Marie Stopes, agrees: \u201cThe only thing left now is for abortion to be taken out of criminal law and be treated as a healthcare issue across the UK, including Northern Ireland. It\u2019s for us to continue the work. I\u2019m so grateful that you all fought so hard for us to have those rights,\u201d she tells Diane. Diane smiles. \u201cThat makes me feel very happy. There are only a couple of us early pioneers left now \u2013 you\u2019ve got to carry that fight on for other women.\u201d Sam has tears rolling down her cheeks. \u201cDo you want another coffee?\u201d asks Diane, gently. \u2018We\u2019re hearing the exact same slurs and experiences as we did 40 years ago\u2019 Roxy Legane, 28, and Nona Ferdon, 91, civil rights activists Midway through their conversation, Nona Ferdon proudly shows Roxy Legane photographs of her standing with Martin Luther King Jr, pictures that were taken on a march from Selma to Montgomery in 1965. Nona explains how, as a clinical psychologist working in Hawaii, she was part of a medical unit that joined the civil rights demonstration. \u201cThe atmosphere was very tense,\u201d she says. \u201cTwo weeks before, people had been stampeded with horses and policemen. We gathered around at a chapel, and it was the first time I heard We Shall Overcome. The second verse was: \u2018Black and white together, we shall overcome.\u2019 That was very much the feeling.\u201d Her eyes brighten as she talks. Five decades later, Roxy is battling racism \u2013 and, as a woman of colour, experiencing it. She works with anti-racist groups and runs the community project Kids of Colour in Manchester. Her own memories of racism go back to childhood. \u201cMy dad wasn\u2019t welcome at my mum\u2019s parents\u2019 house. He was from Mauritius, and they were white, and thought he couldn\u2019t provide what they wanted for her, and for me there was racism wrapped up in that. [Also] growing up in a predominantly white environment, being around lots of micro-aggressions.\u201d She tells Nona that progress feels slow. \u201cLast year I put on an event about racism in education, and a 13-year-old talked about his experiences of violence and restraint at school. Older people in the room were saying, \u2018We\u2019re hearing the same slurs and experiences that we heard 40 years ago.\u2019 That is shocking and frustrating.\u201d She describes being contacted by a mother whose seven-year-old, a mixed-race child, was spat at by a white child of the same age, and told she could not play with white children; and meeting young people of colour who, flattened by the oppression they face, say, \u201cI just want to be white.\u201d Nona agrees that progress is slow. But, she says, \u201cThere have been tremendous changes in the US. I remember the day the Voting Rights Act was passed in 1965, people of colour circled around, block after block, trying to vote.\u201d Before this, they had been prevented from voting because they had failed impossible, deliberately obtuse literacy tests that included questions such as, How many bubbles in a bar of soap?, she explains. While Nona still feels the outlook is bleak, with Trump in the White House, she tells Roxy: \u201cPlease believe me, there have been such massive changes. If you could put your mind back into 1950 \u2013 it was a different world.\u201d \u201cI feel aware of how far we\u2019ve come,\u201d Roxy says. \u201cBut similarly aware of how much there is to be done. In the UK, we\u2019re good at covering up our racism \u2013 but it can be seen in who is most likely to have poor housing, or be in the prison system, or unemployed, and that comes back to people of colour. We look at the US and think: how can they do that to migrant children? But we split up and destroy families here, too.\u201d When Roxy talks of how drained and helpless she can feel, Nona encourages her to talk, to take care of herself. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have someone you can sit down with and say, \u2018My God, you won\u2019t believe what he said to me\u2026\u2019\u201d She adds, \u201cI\u2019ve tried to teach my grandchildren this: every day you live is a footstep in tomorrow, and a brick in the person you want to be.\u201d Once the conversation has drawn to a close, Nona\u2019s daughter takes us to visit the 10 leonberger puppies they have bred. \u201cNow this is what I call self-care,\u201d says Roxy, as she holds one close. \u2018I was 19 and I\u2019d drive to work crying my eyes out\u2019 Alex Evans, 45, and Paul McGregor, 29, lost their fathers to suicide, 18 years apart When commercial manager Alex Evans, 45, meets entrepreneur Paul McGregor, 29, at the Guardian\u2019s offices, it looks from the outside like an ordinary business meeting, all handshakes and nice-to-meet-yous. But in the room there is a tension, as if we are all holding our breath. Paul, his voice steady, goes first. \u201cMy life was straightforward until I was about 18. I grew up in Essex with my parents and older brother. I was quite academic at school, played a lot of football. My mum and dad were childhood sweethearts. On the outside it looked like a happy family. But when I was 18, my dad just broke. His eyes were distant, he was saying things \u2013 we didn\u2019t know what to do.\u201d After taking antidepressants and being admitted to a psychiatric hospital, he killed himself on 4 March 2009, at the age of 45. Paul now tells his story at events to raise awareness of mental health issues; but Alex, from Sussex, has not spoken at length about his father\u2019s death before. \u201cMy family was broken,\u201d he begins. His father was an alcoholic, and in the year before his suicide he lost his driving licence, his job, and the phone was disconnected. He killed himself on 29 October 1991, aged 44, when Alex was away with friends. Before leaving for that trip, Alex says, \u201cI got home after my Saturday shift at McDonald\u2019s, and saw Dad asleep, slumped in the corner of the kitchen, absolutely paralytic, all the dirty dishes piled up. I tried to wake him and he went for me. He kneed me in the balls, tried to headbutt me.\u201d His brother broke up the fight. \u201cThe emotion broke. I was outside, crying and angry. Something inside snapped and I said, \u2018I\u2019m never going to cry about this again.\u2019\u201d His jaw clenches as he explains what happened next: his father tried to apologise, but Alex slammed the door and walked out. That was the last time they saw each other. Paul, the younger man, identifies the link between their experiences. \u201cI think you\u2019ve probably trained yourself not to show your emotions. But as you were talking, one emotion came through that I can relate to massively, and that\u2019s guilt. As you were talking about what you didn\u2019t do, I could see you starting to well up. It\u2019s the same with me.\u201d Both men spent their young adulthood hiding their grief. \u201cI was 19, and I\u2019d drive to work crying my eyes out,\u201d says Paul. \u201cThen I\u2019d get to work, and it was: \u2018Everyone all right?\u2019 and then I\u2019d get back in the car and cry.\u201d \u201cIn the year or two afterwards, I was the archetypal angry young man,\u201d says Alex. \u201cI had my head shaved, a big gold earring, I was like a red mist on a hair trigger. A lot of people saw this horrible man when I was out \u2013 and then I\u2019d be in bed weeping, with no one to offload on to.\u201d While Paul found a therapist, Alex has never felt able to. \u201cMy wife says, \u2018You\u2019re so unemotional, Alex.\u2019 She doesn\u2019t see that sometimes when she goes to bed, I get some old photo albums out, with the suicide letter. I can get quite weepy, and I feel very lucid in myself about my emotions. I can have a conversation with myself about how I feel. But when she walks in, I\u2019ll freeze. We have no secrets and I love her dearly, but I still find it hard to let go.\u201d Both agree that social attitudes around mental health have changed for the better \u2013 but not around suicide. \u201cThere was definitely a stigma,\u201d says Alex. \u201cI always joked about it: when people asked how he died, I\u2019d say, \u2018The usual way \u2013 he stopped breathing.\u2019 I used to hate myself for doing that.\u201d Paul thinks little had changed by 2009. \u201cI remember my dad saying \u2018Be careful near the local psychiatric hospital, because there\u2019s loads of loonies and nutters that might be round there,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cIf that\u2019s what he was conditioned to believe, then that\u2019s probably why he was silent for so long.\u201d When Paul asks how it felt this year to outlive the age at which his father died, Alex says that he felt as if a weight had been lifted. \u201cI\u2019ve almost found it\u2019s freed me up a bit. I\u2019m writing my own story now. I\u2019ve got past the point where he was, and it\u2019s uncharted territory.\u201d For Paul, it is talking that has been freeing. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019ve dealt with it \u2013 there are still times when it\u2019s horrible,\u201d he says. Alex agrees. \u201cPart of me thinks \u2013 even knows, deep down \u2013 that you never get over it. There\u2019s something about it that just wrenches you. But this is the longest I\u2019ve spent talking about it. It\u2019s part of the feeling that the road is opening up.\u201d \u2018Gay marriage is a symbol; it\u2019s society trying to do better\u2019 Tochi Onuora, 20, and Jean Thomson, 90, were both outed at school Sitting in his host\u2019s living room, surrounded by her books and newspapers, Tochi is telling Jean what it was like being outed at school, 70 years after she was.

He adds that the typical buyers in this high-end real estate markets tend to be either people who have large inheritances or foreign buyers. There used to be more Chinese buyers, but these days it\u2019s more likely to be someone from the Middle East. Even for the super-wealthy, $225m is a stretch, though. \u201cI don\u2019t think a house is going to sell for $225m,\u201d Habibi says, \u201cbecause there\u2019s no precedent for that to happen: we\u2019ve never seen it before.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 21 October 2019. An earlier version misnamed Gary Winnick as \u201cGeorge Winnick\u201d. This has been corrected.",

She\u2019s never been personally impacted gun violence, and describes her community as a quiet and safe place to live. However, she doesn\u2019t think that this disqualifies her from being a part of the growing movement to address gun violence.</p> <p>\u201cThe whole country has been affected. We behave differently than we used to in the past,\u201d Stephenson says. \u201cYou might not be someone directly affected by gun violence, but I think we\u2019re all the person to take on this issue.\u201d</p> <p>Stephenson says she will continue her hunger strike until she sees a \u201cgood faith effort from the government in the direction of keeping the public safe\u201d. In particular, she\u2019s urging lawmakers to take up the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019 which passed through the majority democratic Senate more than seven months ago. Democratic leaders and anti-gun violence advocates have been calling on Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell to call for a vote on the bill.</p> <p>Stephenson says she\u2019s taking cues from civil rights protesters like the Freedom Riders, who rode across the south of the United States to protest segregated bus terminals, and the activists who were sprayed with fire hoses and attacked by police and their dogs in the mid-20th century.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s such a powerful way to say \u2018we\u2019re willing to die for our beliefs, we\u2019re willing to die to combat cruelty\u2019,\u201d Larry <strong>Salomon</strong>, a lecturer at San Francisco State University\u2019s College of Ethnic Studies says of the legacy of hunger strikes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/21/march-for-our-lives-reform-peace-plan\">March for Our Lives unveils sweeping gun reform agenda: 'The time is now'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWhen you protest on this level you\u2019re [saying] that we\u2019re fighting something so inhumane that we are willing to die for it,\u201d he continues.</p> <p>Salomon advised three of the four students who went on a 10-day hunger strike at San Francisco State in 2016 to protest budget cuts that would affect the College of Ethnic Studies. And although he is skeptical that Stephenson\u2019s strike will move the federal government into action, he believes that the value of this kind of action can go beyond policy.</p> <p>\u201cWe won\u2019t know what the legacy of any of these actions will be for a while,\u201d Salomon says of the different forms of activism around ending gun violence.</p> <p>\u201cWhen the history of gun control is written this may be a chapter of it,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt might be the thing that got a group of student activists to say \u2018I\u2019m going to do something too\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Now almost a month and a half into the strike, Stephenson says she\u2019s \u201cfeeling cold all the time, and carrying stuff is more of a struggle\u201d. She\u2019s had to stop exercising, and is in regular contact with her doctor who is advising her to stop the strike and resume her regular diet.</p> <p>While her hunger strike has yet to get national attention, she says that the support she is getting from her co-workers, family, and local community is helping her continue her demonstration. She also says she\u2019s donating to pro-gun control congressional candidates and working with local chapters of gun violence prevention groups like Moms Demand Action.</p> <p>\u201cWe can\u2019t afford to sit on this and wait,\u201d Stephenson says. \u201cI\u2019m going to keep plugging away until something changes or [this hunger is] hurting me too much.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a regular person and I think that enough is enough. This is something that America can do better with.\u201d</p> <p><br></p>",

However, she doesn\u2019t think that this disqualifies her from being a part of the growing movement to address gun violence. \u201cThe whole country has been affected. We behave differently than we used to in the past,\u201d Stephenson says. \u201cYou might not be someone directly affected by gun violence, but I think we\u2019re all the person to take on this issue.\u201d Stephenson says she will continue her hunger strike until she sees a \u201cgood faith effort from the government in the direction of keeping the public safe\u201d. In particular, she\u2019s urging lawmakers to take up the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019 which passed through the majority democratic Senate more than seven months ago. Democratic leaders and anti-gun violence advocates have been calling on Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell to call for a vote on the bill. Stephenson says she\u2019s taking cues from civil rights protesters like the Freedom Riders, who rode across the south of the United States to protest segregated bus terminals, and the activists who were sprayed with fire hoses and attacked by police and their dogs in the mid-20th century. \u201cIt\u2019s such a powerful way to say \u2018we\u2019re willing to die for our beliefs, we\u2019re willing to die to combat cruelty\u2019,\u201d Larry Salomon, a lecturer at San Francisco State University\u2019s College of Ethnic Studies says of the legacy of hunger strikes. \u201cWhen you protest on this level you\u2019re [saying] that we\u2019re fighting something so inhumane that we are willing to die for it,\u201d he continues. Salomon advised three of the four students who went on a 10-day hunger strike at San Francisco State in 2016 to protest budget cuts that would affect the College of Ethnic Studies. And although he is skeptical that Stephenson\u2019s strike will move the federal government into action, he believes that the value of this kind of action can go beyond policy. \u201cWe won\u2019t know what the legacy of any of these actions will be for a while,\u201d Salomon says of the different forms of activism around ending gun violence. \u201cWhen the history of gun control is written this may be a chapter of it,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt might be the thing that got a group of student activists to say \u2018I\u2019m going to do something too\u2019.\u201d Now almost a month and a half into the strike, Stephenson says she\u2019s \u201cfeeling cold all the time, and carrying stuff is more of a struggle\u201d. She\u2019s had to stop exercising, and is in regular contact with her doctor who is advising her to stop the strike and resume her regular diet. While her hunger strike has yet to get national attention, she says that the support she is getting from her co-workers, family, and local community is helping her continue her demonstration. She also says she\u2019s donating to pro-gun control congressional candidates and working with local chapters of gun violence prevention groups like Moms Demand Action. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to sit on this and wait,\u201d Stephenson says. \u201cI\u2019m going to keep plugging away until something changes or [this hunger is] hurting me too much.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m a regular person and I think that enough is enough. This is something that America can do better with.\u201d",

The Louvre\u2019s vast Leonardo da Vinci exhibition to mark 500 years since the death of the Italian Renaissance master will finally open next week as the world\u2019s most-visited museum prepares to handle a huge influx of visitors. One of the most expensive exhibitions ever staged in France, it is the first time that such a large number of Leonardo\u2019s drawings, sketches, writings and paintings have ever been brought together. But a question mark still hangs over whether Salvator Mundi \u2014 the world\u2019s most expensive painting \u2014 will be loaned. Mystery surrounds who owns the painting, a depiction of Jesus in Renaissance dress, which was once thought to be held in the Gulf.

Since then what is known on his life has been pored over and seized upon; his vegetarianism and interest in animal welfare have been cited by French anti-hunting groups while the androgynous faces in many of his portraits are considered by some as a modern questioning of gender. At the heart of the Louvre\u2019s exhibition are the lessons that can be learned about Leonardo\u2019s personality from the awe-inspiring realism in his work: portraits such as La Belle Ferronni\u00e8re, the Mona Lisa or his depiction of Saint John the Baptist.

The temporary exhibition space devoted to the Leonardo show can only accommodate 7,000 people per day and the museum did not want to prevent other visitors seeing it. There will also be a virtual reality experience of the Mona Lisa for the first time. As the Louvre faces ever higher visitor numbers, the Leonardo exhibition will only be open to people who have pre-booked. The whole exhibition was in danger last year when Leonardo was dragged into a long-running political spat between Italy\u2019s then far-right ruling League party and France\u2019s president, Emmanuel Macron. Italy said it would cancel the loan of some paintings, accusing France of trying to take centre stage in the commemorations marking 500 years since the painter\u2019s death. \u201cLeonardo is Italian; he only died in France,\u201d one far-right MP said. The row was finally resolved but then a last-minute legal challenge this month nearly stopped da Vinci\u2019s Vitruvian Man \u2013 a study in anatomical proportions \u2013 from appearing. An Italian heritage group said the drawing, which is kept in a climate-controlled vault at the Accademia Gallery of Venice, was too fragile to travel and risked being damaged by lighting in the Louvre if displayed for a long period.

      "bodyText": "Live political reporting continues in Monday\u2019s blog: Hillary Clinton became the center of the news cycle, not just because of her suggestions about representative Tulsi Gabbard, but because the state department finally completed its investigation into her emails. Pete Buttigieg came under fire for acception a donation from a Chicago city attorney who fought to block the release of the video in the Laquan McDonald shooting. Juli\u00e1n Castro made a point to say, \u201cAt a time where police violence remains such a critical issue, it shouldn\u2019t take four months to return such a problematic contribution.\u201d The supreme court will decide the constitutionality of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a government agency that Elizabeth Warren considers her baby. Rudy Giuliani pressured both the state department and the White House to grant a visa to a former Ukraine official who promised dirt on Hunter Biden. Thanks for tuning in, everybody. Don\u2019t cowardly hide behind your proxies! It wouldn\u2019t be a late Friday live blog without ANY impeachment inquiry fodder, now would it? Rudy Giuliani, personal attorney to Donald Trump, tried to get both the State Department and the White House to grant a visa to a former Ukraine official who he believed had dirt on the Democrats, CNN is reporting. At the center of this particular piece of the impeachment pie is Ukrainian prosecutor-general Viktor Shokin, who was pushed out of his position in 2016 after pressure from Western leaders, including then-Vice President Joe Biden, over concerns that he was not pursuing corruption cases. Shokin claimed he was pushed out to stop an investigation into the Ukrainian natural gas company for which Hunter Biden sits on the board - allegations that have been backed by no evidence whatsoever - but either way, Giuliani is on the record with CNN saying he wanted to interview Shokin in person because he promised to reveal dirt on Democrats. This week, diplomat George Kent revealed just how badly Giuliani wanted to interview Shokin in person during Kent\u2019s closed-door testimony before Congress. In the end, Giuliani had to resort to Skype. Partying like it\u2019s 2016 up in here. How many times did Hillary Clinton get mentioned in the blog today? One very important detail from the Slate story that this tweet leaves out: in addition to Kirstjen Nielsen, the event that Clinton is backing out of will also feature Representative Tulsi Gabbard - you know, the Democratic presidential candidate whom Clinton suggested the Russians were grooming? The one who responded to such allegations by calling Clinton \u201cthe queen of warmongers, the embodiment of corruption\u201d? Elizabeth Warren responds to the Supreme Court announcing that it will decide the constitutionality of her baby, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau: More than three years and one whole presidential election cycle ago, the State Department launched an internal investigation into Hillary Clinton and her use of private email as secretary of state. According to a letter sent to Senator Chuck Grassley this week and released Friday, it\u2019s finally done. Investigators determined that 38 people sent classified information that ended up in Clinton\u2019s personal email in 91 separate cases. There was an additional 497 violations for which no individual was found culpable. However, investigators found \u201cno persuasive evidence of systemic, deliberate mishandling of classified information\u201d. But \u201cthe use of a private email system to conduct official business added an increased degree of risk of compromise as a private system lacks the network monitoring and intrusion detection capabilities of State Department networks\u201d, the report states. The 38 people who sent classified information are current and former State Department officials, and could face some disciplinary action or a note in their files, according to the Associated Press. If you\u2019d trot your mind back to 2016, you\u2019ll recall that Clinton\u2019s emails became a main focal point of Trump\u2019s campaign after then-FBI director James Comey held a news conference about them just months before the election. FBI specialists did not find evidence that the server had been hacked, the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general said. A lot of government ethics watchdogs were skeptical when the White House announced yesterday that next year\u2019s G7 summit will take place at at golf resort owned by Donald Trump. Well: With Pete Buttigieg still smarting over the decision to make the former Chicago city attorney who fought to block the release of the video in the Laquan McDonald shooting a fundraiser sponsor, Julian Castro takes his shot: Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic presidential frontrunner, proudly states in her Twitter bio that she\u2019s mom to Amelia, Alex, Bailey (her dog) and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Today, the Supreme Court announced that it would decide whether the CFPB is unconstitutional. As Axios notes, the issue at hand here is that the CFPB has one director whom the president cannot fire at will, which some say is a violation of the president\u2019s constitutional powers. The court will either have to uphold the CFPB\u2019s current structure, throw out the CFPB completely, or rule that the director must be fireable. In a truly banner day for Democratic presidential candidates, the Associated Press is reporting that Mayor Pete Buttigieg is removing a former Chicago city attorney as a fundraiser sponsor and returning his campaign contributions after the AP discovered that this was the same city attorney that fought to block the release of the video in the Laquan McDonald shooting. Laquan McDonald was a black teenager who was shot 16 times by a white Chicago police officer in October 2014. The shooting sparked public outrage and months of protest once dashcam video of the shooting was released by court order in 2015. The officer, Jason Van Dyke, was ultimately convicted of second-degree murder. He was charged the same day the video was released. To jog everyone\u2019s memory, Mayor Pete has come under fire for his handling of race and police violence, in particular after a white police officer shot and killed an African American man in his city of South Bend, Indiana this summer. Though his campaign took steps to remedy the situation, the AP noted that it did so \u201conly after the swell of backlash\u201d. Either way, black activists have already taken note. \u201cThe worst case scenario is his people know and they just don\u2019t care, or they don\u2019t know and haven\u2019t vetted him thoroughly,\u201d Charlene Carruthers, former head of Black Lives Matter group BYP100, told the AP. Hey all, Vivian Ho with the west coast bureau, taking over for Joan Greve. Happy Friday. Here\u2019s Cory Booker responding in gif form to Tulsi Gabbard calling Hillary Clinton the \u201cqueen of warmongers\u201d over allegations that the Russians are grooming Gabbard. That\u2019s it from me this week. My west coast colleague, Vivian Ho, will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Trump said that Mick Mulvaney had \u201cclarified\u201d his quid pro comments, but Democrats said that they found the acting White House chief of staff\u2019s walkback to be woefully lacking. Mulvaney told reporters yesterday that Trump withheld military aid from Ukraine to pressure the country to investigate the Democrats. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell wrote a Washington Post op-ed criticizing the withdrawal of US troops from northern Syria, while senator Lindsey Graham said America\u2019s agreement with Turkey could lead to an \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d of the Kurds. Hillary Clinton hinted that she believed Russia was \u201cgrooming\u201d Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard to launch a third-party White House bid. Gabbard responded by labeling Clinton \u201cthe queen of warmongers\u201d and calling on her to enter the Democratic primary race so they could sort out their differences directly. Trump announced he would nominate Dan Brouillette, the deputy secretary of energy, to lead the department following Rick Perry\u2019s resignation. Vivian will have more on the news of the day, so stay tuned \u2013 and have a wonderful weekend. Meanwhile, House Democrats are preparing a resolution to condemn the Trump administration\u2019s announcement that the June G7 summit would be held at the president\u2019s resort in Doral, Florida. The news immediately sparked complaints that Trump was using the office of the presidency to benefit his businesses, and a number of ethic experts lambasted the decision as a textbook case of self-dealing. Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard has responded \u2013 in a very forceful way \u2013 to Hillary Clinton\u2019s insinuation that the Russians are \u201cgrooming\u201d her to launch a third-party White House bid. Calling Clinton \u201cthe queen of warmongers,\u201d Gabbard accused Clinton of leading \u201ca concerted campaign to destroy my reputation.\u201d The Hawaii congresswoman then demanded that Clinton \u201cjoin the race directly\u201d to sort out their differences on the matter. Clinton seemed to reference Gabbard in an earlier interview, saying: \u201cI\u2019m not making any predictions, but I think [the Russians have] got their eye on someone who\u2019s currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate. She\u2019s the favorite of the Russians. They have a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her so far.\u201d Reports have emerged that Russian state media frequently mention Gabbard, but the congresswoman has slammed claims that she is a \u201cRussian asset\u201d as \u201csmears.\u201d The Washington Post has just published an op-ed from Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, who argued that Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw US troops from northern Syria was a \u201cgrave strategic mistake.\u201d The Kentucky Republican writes: Withdrawing U.S. forces from Syria is a grave strategic mistake. It will leave the American people and homeland less safe, embolden our enemies, and weaken important alliances. Sadly, the recently announced pullout risks repeating the Obama administration\u2019s reckless withdrawal from Iraq, which facilitated the rise of the Islamic State in the first place. ... To keep pressure on Islamic State terrorists, deter Iranian aggression and buy our local partners more leverage to negotiate with Bashar al-Assad to end the underlying conflict, we should retain a limited military presence in Syria and maintain our presence in Iraq and elsewhere in the region. We must also work closely with allies threatened by this chaos, such as Israel and Jordan, and redouble international efforts to pressure the Assad regime. And Congress must finally pass the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act to hold the regime accountable for its atrocities. McConnell interestingly never mentions Trump by name, but the escalation of Republican opposition to the troop withdrawal could signal trouble for the president as he seeks to keep his party unified in the face of the impeachment inquiry. Senator Lindsey Graham, who has become one of the fiercest Republican critics of Trump\u2019s Syria policy, has voiced concern about the proposed \u201cceasefire\u201d (which Turkey has said is actually just a \u201cpause\u201d in operations). Graham said he spoke to a commander of the Syrian Democratic Forces, who voiced fear that Turkey was effectively proposing an ethic cleansing of the Kurdish people. The South Carolina Republican said: \u201cA buffer zone is acceptable to the Kurds but a military occupation that displaces hundreds of thousands is not a safe zone. It is ethnic cleansing.\u201d Graham, who has worked with Democratic senator Chris Van Hollen to introduce a bill that would enact sanctions against Turkey, promise to continue congressional efforts to help America\u2019s Kurdish allies. Confirming widespread speculation, Trump announced that he would nominate Dan Brouillette, the deputy secretary of energy, to take over the department. News broke yesterday that energy secretary Rick Perry intended to resign, and the former Texas governor seemed to have been grooming Brouillette as a potential successor in recent months. Democratic presidential candidate Tom Steyer is calling on Nancy Pelosi and other senior House Democrats to hold public hearings in the impeachment inquiry. The billionaire activist, who has been calling for Trump\u2019s impeachment since shortly after the president took office, said in a statement: \u201cWhile I am relieved that an impeachment inquiry is finally underway, Speaker Pelosi and House Democratic Leadership need to start public hearings immediately so that the American people can see the full extent of Donald Trump\u2019s crimes, corruption, and cover-ups. \u201cEvery single day, the scandals surrounding Trump\u2019s disastrous presidency continue to reveal the shameless lengths he is willing to go to put his own financial and political interests ahead of the interests of our country.\u201d House Republicans have similarly complained that the impeachment inquiry is largely taking place behind closed doors, but their Democratic colleagues have insisted that private interviews are necessary to prevent witnesses from coordinating testimony. Trump\u2019s re-election campaign is standing by Mick Mulvaney\u2019s quid pro quo admission, so much so that it is now selling t-shirts with a quote from the acting White House chief of staff: \u201cGet over it.\u201d Brad Parscale, the president\u2019s campaign manager, said in a statement announcing sale of the shirts: \u201cLife isn\u2019t a movie and there are real issues facing Americans today that Washington politicians are not addressing because they\u2019re obsessed with theatrical witch hunts against their political rivals. The President has been fully transparent and it\u2019s time for Democrats to get over it.\u201d The decision to advertise the quote is somewhat perplexing, considering Mulvaney later walked back his admission that the delaying of military aid to Ukraine was linked to a quid pro quo. While speaking to reporters at the White House yesterday, Mulvaney acknowledged that Trump had held back the military aid to pressure Ukraine to open an investigation into the Democrats. Mulvaney said: \u201cI have news for everybody: Get over it. There is going to be political influence in foreign policy.\u201d However, the White House official later walked that back in a statement, saying: \u201cThe only reasons we were holding the money was because of concern about lack of support from other nations and concerns over corruption.\u201d Joe Biden has just rolled out 51 new endorsements from current and former lawmakers in Massachusetts, the home state of fellow Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren. Biden\u2019s campaign manager said in a statement announcing the endorsements: \u201cThe Bay Staters who\u2019ve joined with us today are ready for that fight, and know that Joe Biden can unite the country across party lines to defeat Donald Trump.\u201d Many of those endorsing Biden similarly backed his unsuccessful presidential bid in 2008, according to a Politico reporter. However, after Trump captured the Republican nomination in 2016 with virtually no party backing, there has been increased skepticism that endorsements actually matter all that much in primary contests, as a Bloomberg News reporter noted. John Kasich, the former Republican governor of Ohio, said he thought that Trump should be impeached. Kasich, who sought the 2016 Republican presidential nomination against Trump, told CNN that he thought the president had \u201ccrossed the Rubicon\u201d and deserved to be impeached. Kasich added: \u201cI say it with great sadness. This is not something that I really wanted to do. ... But this behavior, in my opinion, cannot be tolerated.\u201d The former governor has repeatedly criticized Trump in the past and recently said that he would not vote for the president in the 2020 election. The top Republican on the House judiciary committee, Doug Collins, is demanding access to the depositions from the impeachment inquiry, even though his panel is not one of the three leading the probe. Collins said in a letter to the three Democratic chairs leading the inquiry: \u201cI write to inform you of my intent to exercise my right under House Rule XI, Clause 2(e)(2)(A) to review documents and records in possession of [your committees] so that you may prepare accordingly. \u201cPlease make available all records, documents, transcripts, and other materials related to or obtained in the course of the ongoing joint investigation between the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Committee on Foreign Affairs, and Committee on Oversight and Reform.\u201d One of Collins\u2019 Republican colleagues on the judiciary committee, Matt Gaetz, tried to demand access to the investigating panels\u2019 interview with Fiona Hill, Trump\u2019s former top adviser on Russia, earlier this week. The House parliamentarian ruled that Gaetz could not sit in on the interview because his panel was not one of the three leading the inquiry, so it will be interesting to see if Collins\u2019 demand goes similarly unmet. Secretary of state Mike Pompeo criticized House Democrats\u2019 handling of the impeachment inquiry against Trump, echoing Republicans\u2019 complaints that witnesses have not testified alongside government lawyers. Pompeo told Politico: \u201cThey\u2019re not letting state department lawyers in the room \u2026 they have not let state department lawyers be part of these hearings ... That\u2019s unheard of \u2026 I haven\u2019t seen you all report that.\u201d However, a Washington Post reporter noted that government lawyers are actually never allowed into the room during depositions. Trump is reportedly meeting with Dan Brouillette, the deputy secretary of energy, today. The meeting comes just a day after Brouillette\u2019s boss, Rick Perry, informed the president of his intention to resign. Earlier this month, Bloomberg News reported on Perry cultivating Brouillette as a possible successor: Brouillette has recently has taken a higher profile role at the department, filling in for Perry in appearances abroad and on television interviews as well as cabinet meetings. That\u2019s viewed by some as an effort by the secretary to prepare a successor. Brouillette, 57, has also taken a bigger role on some policy matters, such as natural gas exports and touting American energy to foreign allies. Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House intelligence committee, said he did not find Mick Mulvaney\u2019s walkback of his quid pro quo admission to be \u201cthe least bit credible.\u201d The acting White House chief of staff acknowledged to reporters yesterday that the delay in dispersing military aid to Ukraine was due to Trump\u2019s demand for an investigation into the Democrats. But Mulvaney denied that claim in a statement just hours later, saying: \u201cThe only reasons we were holding the money was because of concern about lack of support from other nations and concerns over corruption.\u201d Here\u2019s where things stand so far today: Trump told reporters Mick Mulvaney had \u201cclarified\u201d his admission yesterday that the delay in dispersing military aid to Ukraine was the result of a quid pro quo. The acting White House chief of staff issued a statement last night denying the charge, just hours after he told reporters that the aid was delayed because of Trump\u2019s request for an investigation into the Democrats. Hillary Clinton suggested that the Russians may be \u201cgrooming\u201d Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard to launch a third-party White House bid. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, said Trump\u2019s letter to him urging caution in Syria showed a lack of respect, warning that he would respond to the US president\u2019s breach of decorum in time. There will be plenty more coming up, so stay tuned. Trump is taking questions from reporters about the Ukraine controversy after speaking to the two Nasa astronauts who are participating in the first all-woman spacewalk. Asked about Mick Mulvaney\u2019s admission that the delay in dispersing military aid to Ukraine was related to the president\u2019s request for an investigation into Democrats, Trump said: \u201cI think he clarified that.\u201d Last night, the acting White House chief of staff issued a statement that said: \u201cThe only reasons we were holding the money was because of concern about lack of support from other nations and concerns over corruption. There never was any condition on the flow of the aid related to the matter of the DNC server.\u201d But hours earlier, Mulvaney described the requested investigation into the 2016 election and told reporters: \u201cThat\u2019s why we held up the money.\u201d Addressing concerns that the Trump administration had allowed political interests to influence foreign policy, Mulvaney said: \u201cI have news for everybody: Get over it ... There is going to be political influence in foreign policy.\u201d Flanked by Mike Pence and Ivanka Trump, the president has just concluded a call to Christina Koch and Jessica Meir, the Nasa astronauts who are participating in the first spacewalk conducted entirely by women. Trump praised Koch and Meir as \u201cvery brave, brilliant women\u201d and told them that the country was \u201cvery proud\u201d of them. The president also reiterated his goal of seeing Nasa launch an expedition to Mars. Trump said: \u201cFirst the moon and then we go to Mars.\u201d Hillary Clinton is doubling down on her suggestion that the Russians are \u201cgrooming\u201d Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard to launch a third-party White House bid. Clinton did not mention Gabbard by name when she said: \u201cI\u2019m not making any predictions, but I think they\u2019ve got their eye on someone who\u2019s currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate. She\u2019s the favorite of the Russians. They have a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her so far.\u201d When asked if the former secretary of state was referring to Gabbard, Clinton\u2019s spokesperson said: \u201cIf the nesting doll fits.\u201d Trump reportedly intends to participate in a forum on criminal justice alongside several of the Democratic presidential candidates in South Carolina. The State, a South Carolina newspaper, reports: His participation will bring him to a historically black college in South Carolina, where he will share billing with half a dozen Democrats vying to replace him in 2020. The lead-up to Trump\u2019s decision to join the program at Benedict College in Columbia the weekend of Oct. 25-27 was closely-guarded by organizers, who feared the president would either change his mind or alienate those who had already committed to attending or participating. Two sources familiar with planning for the event confirmed Trump\u2019s attendance to The State on Friday afternoon. The White House also confirmed Trump intends on going. A tense argument about the impeachment inquiry has broken out on the House floor between the Democratic majority leader, Steny Hoyer, and the Republican whip, Steve Scalise. Scalise, a Republican of Louisiana, is complaining that Democrats are conducting the inquiry behind the closed doors and without holding a formal vote to authorize the investigation, although that is not legally required. Scalise also falsely claimed that the whistleblower complaint on Trumps\u2019s Ukraine call had been largely debunked, reiterating an oft-repeated talking point of the president\u2019s. In a tweet thread commenting on the situation in Syria, Trump claimed that the ceasefire in Syria (which Turkey has actually called a \u201cpause\u201d) is working and that some European nations have agreed to take Islamic State fighters from the region. Hillary Clinton has just done an interview with David Plouffe, Barack Obama\u2019s former campaign manager, and wow. She did not hold back. For starters, the former Democratic presidential candidate suggested that Russia had compromising information, or kompromat, on Trump. Clinton also said she thought Jill Stein, the Green Party\u2019s 2016 presidential nominee, was a Russian asset: \u201cYeah, she\u2019s a Russian asset \u2013 I mean, totally. They know they can\u2019t win without a third-party candidate. So I don\u2019t know who it\u2019s going to be, but I will guarantee you they will have a vigorous third-party challenge in the key states that they most needed.\u201d Clinton did offer a suggestion of who the next \u201cRussian asset\u201d might be: Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard. Clinton said in an apparent reference to the Hawaii congresswoman: \u201cI\u2019m not making any predictions, but I think they\u2019ve got their eye on someone who\u2019s currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate. She\u2019s the favorite of the Russians. They have a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her so far.\u201d During Tuesday\u2019s presidential debate, Gabbard lashed out against a New York Times article that noted she was frequently mentioned on Russian state media, a surprising trend given that she is polling in the low single digits. However, the congresswoman has said she would not launch an independent presidential bid if she lost the Democratic nomination. Jane Fonda is holding another protest in Washington as part of her Fire Drill Fridays campaign, which is meant to bring more attention to the climate crisis. Watch the Guardian\u2019s live feed below. The 81-year-old actor was arrested on the steps of the US Capitol last Friday as part of the campaign. She told the Los Angeles Times recently that she was inspired to act by Greta Thunberg, the teenage climate activist from Sweden who recently condemned inaction to combat the crisis during the UN general assembly. Fonda said of Thunberg: \u201c[S]he read the [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] report and she realized that the crisis was barreling straight at us, like a train, and looked around and people weren\u2019t behaving appropriately. It so traumatized her that she stopped eating. I hadn\u2019t realized that she stopped eating and speaking for almost a year. And that really hit me.\u201d Today is a quieter day in the impeachment inquiry, with no closed-door interviews scheduled on Capitol Hill. The schedule will pick up again starting Tuesday, with acting US ambassador to Ukraine Bill Taylor speaking to the House committees leading the investigation. A Republican congressman who sits on the House foreign affairs committee, one of the three panels leading the impeachment inquiry against Trump, appeared open to the possibility that the president may have committed impeachable offenses in his conduct toward Ukraine. However, another House Republican who is a member of the intelligence committee seemed entirely unconcerned that Trump had reportedly delegated his Ukraine policy to Rudy Giuliani, his personal lawyer. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, said that Trump\u2019s letter to him urging caution in Syria showed a lack of respect, and he warned that he would respond to it in time. The White House confirmed earlier this week that Trump sent a letter to Erdogan on the situation in Syria. The letter concluded: \u201cDon\u2019t be a tough guy. Don\u2019t be a fool! I will call you later.\u201d Erdogan said the letter was not in line with usual diplomatic customs and showed a lack of respect. The Turkish president, who is meeting with Vladimir Putin on Tuesday, said: \u201cWhen the time comes, necessary steps will be taken.\u201d The Baltimore Sun commemorated the loss of the city\u2019s longtime congressman, Elijah Cummings, with a front-page story under the headline \u201cA strong voice stilled.\u201d Cummings, a key figure in the impeachment inquiry against Trump as the Democratic chairman of the House oversight committee, represented his Baltimore district for more than 20 years. He died yesterday at the age of 68 and has been heralded by many of his fellow lawmakers as a \u201cgiant\u201d in fighting to improve American democracy and the lives of his constituents. State department official George Kent told House investigators leading the impeachment inquiry against Trump that he raised concerns about Hunter Biden\u2019s foreign business activities in 2015, according to the Washington Post. The Post reports: George Kent, a deputy assistant secretary of state, testified Tuesday that he worried that Hunter Biden\u2019s position at the firm Burisma Holdings would complicate efforts by U.S. diplomats to convey to Ukrainian officials the importance of avoiding conflicts of interest, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of confidentiality rules surrounding the deposition. Kent said he had concerns that Ukrainian officials would view Hunter Biden as a conduit for currying influence with his father, said the people. But when Kent raised the issue with Biden\u2019s office, he was told the then-vice president didn\u2019t have the \u2018bandwidth\u2019 to deal with the issue involving his son as his other son, Beau, was battling cancer, said the people familiar with his testimony. Another Post reporter said this of Kent\u2019s testimony: The Republican senator Mitt Romney delivered a blistering critique of Trump\u2019s Syria policy in a Senate floor speech yesterday, calling the US abandonment of the Kurds \u201ca bloodstain on the annals of American history\u201d. But as the Washington Post\u2019s Aaron Blake noted, Romney also interestingly suggested that Trump may have been bullied into the decision by the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan. The Utah Republican said: \u201cIt\u2019s been \u2026 suggested that Turkey may have called America\u2019s bluff, telling the president they are coming no matter what we did. If that\u2019s so, we should know it. For it would tell us a great deal about how we should deal with Turkey, now and in the future.\u201d Romney suggested holding hearings to probe how Trump arrived at the controversial decision to withdraw US troops from northern Syria. Romney\u2019s criticism, combined with the fact that about two-thirds of House Republicans voted in favor of a resolution to condemn Trump\u2019s troop withdrawal, indicates how far apart the president and his party are moving on foreign policy. Good morning, live blog readers! Donald Trump, who took office bragging that he had assembled a team of \u201cmy generals\u201d to lead his administration, is now receiving severe criticism from at least three former top military leaders \u2013 including his former defense secretary, Gen James Mattis. Speaking at the Al Smith Memorial Foundation dinner in New York, Mattis mocked Trump for his lack of military service and for calling the former defense secretary \u201cthe most overrated general\u201d. Referring to the bone spurs Trump cited to avoid serving in the Vietnam War, Mattis said: \u201cI earned my spurs on the battlefield. Donald Trump earned his spurs in a letter from a doctor.\u201d Trump is taking heat from other former military leaders as well. Adm William McRaven, a former commander of the US Special Operations Command, penned a New York Times op-ed entitled Our Republic Is Under Attack From the President. And retired four-star Gen Barry McCaffrey slammed Trump\u2019s Syria policy as \u201cinexplicable\u201d. Given that Trump has no events on his public schedule today, it seems likely his Twitter feed will soon be offering some commentary on these military critics. Here\u2019s what else the blog is keeping its eye on: Today is the subpoena-imposed deadline for energy secretary Rick Perry and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney to hand over documents in the impeachment inquiry, but it seems unlikely that they will comply given that they are current Trump administration officials. Secretary of state Mike Pompeo is in Jerusalem, where he met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu earlier this morning. The annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank Group will open in Washington today. The blog is watching all of that, so stay tuned.",
