Learn slowly, and be prepared to listen.\u201d</p> <p>Shewry, who was born and raised in New Zealand, had worked for Attica for more than a decade when he borrowed against his house to buy it from its owners in 2015.

Shewry regularly goes on research trips on country, and the restaurant hosts programs for Indigenous kids. \u201cWorking with those ingredients comes with a responsibility, and you can\u2019t just mess with that,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. \u201cOtherwise it\u2019s just colonisation continuing.</p> <p>\u201cI fear that we see a lot of tokenism in this space.

      "bodyText": "The restaurateur Ben Shewry has delivered a plea to the food industry to \u201cpay it forward\u201d to Indigenous Australia after his Melbourne restaurant Attica was named the country\u2019s best on Wednesday night. The Gourmet Traveller food awards are judged by the publications\u2019s food critics, who arrived unannounced at hundreds of Australian restaurants throughout the year. The 2019 ceremony was hosted by Bennelong at the Sydney Opera House: a restaurant named for the Indigenous warrior who acted as an envoy between his Eora nation and British colonisers. Bennelong\u2019s true story is complex and brutal: straddling two worlds and accepted by neither, he died of alcohol addiction in 1813. It\u2019s a sombre history to consider alongside such a lavish event but, as Shewry encouraged his industry to give back to Indigenous Australia, the irony of the location was hard to ignore. The chef spoke about the Dark Emu author, Bruce Pascoe, and the Budawang teacher and chef Noel Butler, who both invited him on to traditional land to learn about Indigenous food. \u201cIt made me feel microscopic \u2013 like a speck on the landscape,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s all this culture connected to these ingredients, and we want to pay that forward; we feel like that\u2019s the baseline moral obligation for someone working with indigenous ingredients in Australia. \u201cIf you haven\u2019t made that commitment yet, don\u2019t be scared,\u201d he continued from the podium. \u201cEmbrace it. Learn slowly, and be prepared to listen.\u201d Shewry, who was born and raised in New Zealand, had worked for Attica for more than a decade when he borrowed against his house to buy it from its owners in 2015. That same year he was featured in the first season of Netflix\u2019s Chef\u2019s Table, and Attica was voted Australia\u2019s top restaurant in the prestigious World\u2019s Top 50 restaurants list. At a hefty $295 a person, Attica\u2019s current menu celebrates native Australian produce including crocodile, emu, wattle, desert lime, black ants and bunya bunya nuts. Shewry regularly goes on research trips on country, and the restaurant hosts programs for Indigenous kids. \u201cWorking with those ingredients comes with a responsibility, and you can\u2019t just mess with that,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. \u201cOtherwise it\u2019s just colonisation continuing. \u201cI fear that we see a lot of tokenism in this space. People don\u2019t want to commit to getting to know the culture of the ingredients \u2013 the stories, the people connected to them, the language, the culinary uses of them.\u201d Respect for native ingredients and Indigenous culture is also at the heart of Adelaide\u2019s Orana: a 10-table restaurant on Rundle Street run by Scottish-born Jock Zonfrillo, which \u2013 through its non-profit foundation \u2013 is dedicated to preserving and promoting indigenous ingredients. Orana \u2013 which is enjoying a month-long residency in Sydney \u2013 won Gourmet Traveller\u2019s top prize in 2017 and was awarded the inaugural sustainability and innovation prize on Wednesday. The peer-voted prize for chef of the year was won by Barbados-born Paul Carmichael from Momofuku Sei\u014dbo: David Chang\u2019s first restaurant outside New York, which is based in Sydney\u2019s Star Casino. Carmichael took Sei\u014dbo over in 2015 and, within months, had thrown out Chang\u2019s signature dishes and turned the menu into a celebration of Caribbean cuisine. He said he has grown much more confident in the role over the last few years. \u201cBack then I would have just been trying to keep my head above water,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. \u201cI had a really messed up view of what the restaurant could be. I was trying to fit in a box that I didn\u2019t belong in.\u201d Sei\u014dbo was named best restaurant in 2016 and these days its dishes include plantain tostada, lamb tartare with mango hot sauce, and pork chop with jerk and burnt lime. \u201cNow it\u2019s about growing and exploring the style a little bit more, and feeling more confident and not apologetic about it,\u201d Carmichael said. \u201cI\u2019m still trying to figure that out.\u201d The reflective mood was sustained by the Sydney restaurateur Kylie Kwong, who was honoured for her outstanding contribution to hospitality. After 19 years, Kwong\u2019s acclaimed Sydney restaurant Billy Kwong closed its doors in June. \u201cAn enormous chapter has come to a natural end with the letting go of my restaurant life, but one thing is for sure: my path going forward will continue to be guided by [my] values,\u201d she said, including \u201cconstantly questioning what it means to be a chef\u201d. \u201cThe wonderful responsibility we chefs have is to play a positive role in society,\u201d she continued, \u201cand to make sure the motivation behind our work is always about bringing benefit \u2013 not just to ourselves but also to others.\u201d Kwong is still deciding on the details of her next venture, but is committed to making it small. \u201cIt won\u2019t be a restaurant,\u201d she has said, clarifying to the Guardian that \u201cthe emphasis is going to be on bespoke, high quality sustainable food and producer-collaborations.\u201d The best new talent award went to Alanna Sapwell of Arc Dining &amp; Wine Bar in Brisbane; and best new restaurant and best design were both won by Di Stasio Citt\u00e0, a new eatery from Rinaldo di Stasio in central Melbourne.

      "body": "<p>After several shows in which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/aug/16/jayde-adams-the-divine-ms-jayde-review-musical-comedy\">showbiz and song featured as prominently as standup</a>, Jayde Adams doesn\u2019t think she\u2019s being taken seriously enough as a comedian. This year\u2019s offering sets out to fix that. Having not read a book in seven years, Adams has been boning up on feminism. The glam couture has been swapped for a black turtleneck, uniform of the earnest. The Bristolian is not impressed by fourth-wave feminism \u2013 or by how Beyonc\u00e9 and the Kardashians represent it \u2013 and is here to take it to task.</p> <p>The Ballad of Kylie Jenner\u2019s Old Face \u2013 good title \u2013 is certainly a departure from her previous work, if not the great leap forward some have perceived. (The pop it takes at Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s feminism is reheated from previous shows.) Adams pours cold water on the progressive claims made for pop culture icons, arguing they conceal the more radical work being done elsewhere. Perhaps \u2013 just perhaps \u2013 Jay-Z grabbing his wife\u2019s backside onstage isn\u2019t really advancing the gender equality cause, while Adams posits a very droll analogy for the attractive actor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jul/28/jameela-jamil-wont-become-double-agent-patriarchy\">Jameela Jamil</a> writing a book about body positivity.</p> <p>Her blunt good sense is deployed to optimal effect in these sections, as she highlights the contradictions in our Instagram era between what we see and what we\u2019re told we see. But there are contradictions at play here, too. One routine recounts Adams\u2019s experience of online harassment after she disses a member of the band Little Mix on social media. But in a show purportedly about compassion, her offending tweet isn\u2019t a glowing example of compassion itself.</p> <p>The bigger problem, though, is that her inquiry into feminism doesn\u2019t reach much of a conclusion. \u201cI think I\u2019ve made my point,\u201d she says at the end, but \u2013 having told us her show is about confidence (largely to justify a tangential anecdote about an unpleasant Parisian dining experience), then projected the word \u201ccompassion\u201d on her upstage screen \u2013 she hasn\u2019t, really. I relished Adams\u2019s takedown of fashionable pop-feminism, which is very well done. Less so the lessons she draws from it.</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/jayde-adams-the-ballad-of-kylie-jenner-s-old-face\">At Pleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh</a>, until 25 August. </p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/edinburgh-festival-2019+tone/reviews\">Read all our Edinburgh festival reviews</a>.</p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "After several shows in which showbiz and song featured as prominently as standup, Jayde Adams doesn\u2019t think she\u2019s being taken seriously enough as a comedian. This year\u2019s offering sets out to fix that. Having not read a book in seven years, Adams has been boning up on feminism. The glam couture has been swapped for a black turtleneck, uniform of the earnest. The Bristolian is not impressed by fourth-wave feminism \u2013 or by how Beyonc\u00e9 and the Kardashians represent it \u2013 and is here to take it to task. The Ballad of Kylie Jenner\u2019s Old Face \u2013 good title \u2013 is certainly a departure from her previous work, if not the great leap forward some have perceived. (The pop it takes at Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s feminism is reheated from previous shows.) Adams pours cold water on the progressive claims made for pop culture icons, arguing they conceal the more radical work being done elsewhere. Perhaps \u2013 just perhaps \u2013 Jay-Z grabbing his wife\u2019s backside onstage isn\u2019t really advancing the gender equality cause, while Adams posits a very droll analogy for the attractive actor Jameela Jamil writing a book about body positivity. Her blunt good sense is deployed to optimal effect in these sections, as she highlights the contradictions in our Instagram era between what we see and what we\u2019re told we see. But there are contradictions at play here, too. One routine recounts Adams\u2019s experience of online harassment after she disses a member of the band Little Mix on social media. But in a show purportedly about compassion, her offending tweet isn\u2019t a glowing example of compassion itself. The bigger problem, though, is that her inquiry into feminism doesn\u2019t reach much of a conclusion. \u201cI think I\u2019ve made my point,\u201d she says at the end, but \u2013 having told us her show is about confidence (largely to justify a tangential anecdote about an unpleasant Parisian dining experience), then projected the word \u201ccompassion\u201d on her upstage screen \u2013 she hasn\u2019t, really. I relished Adams\u2019s takedown of fashionable pop-feminism, which is very well done. Less so the lessons she draws from it. At Pleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh, until 25 August. Read all our Edinburgh festival reviews.",

Macron said that as a former sherpa himself who had spent full nights racing to get such communiqu\u00e9s agreed, they were a waste of time which could be better spent developing strategy. Instead there would be what he called \u201cuseful\u201d, informal conversations \u201cbehind closed doors\u201d to bring leaders closer on key issues. The G7 group includes the US, France, Britain, Japan, Germany, Italy and Canada, and the European Union also attends. This year Macron has also invited leaders from several other countries including India, Australia, South Africa, Senegal and Rwanda to widen the debate on inequality and climate change. Macron said \u201cfinding a solution on Ukraine\u201d on the basis of existing peace talks was an \u201cessential precondition\u201d for Moscow\u2019s return to the group. Russia was thrown out of what was the G8 in 2014 after it seized Ukraine\u2019s Black Sea peninsula of Crimea, an annexation never recognised by the international community. Asked whether he feared the US\u2019s Trump and UK\u2019s Johnson siding together against others at the G7, Macron said he did not think it was Johnson\u2019s plan after leaving the EU for the UK to simply become the \u201cjunior partner\u201d of the US, or a vassal state. He said the UK remained close to many European capitals on foreign policy.",

      "bodyText": "The use of drug dogs is helping to fuel a massive increase in strip-searches by New South Wales police, often without legal grounds. A report released on Thursday reveals that in the past 12 years the number of strip-searches conducted in NSW increased almost 20-fold, from 277 times in the 12 months to 30 November 2006 to 5,483 in 2018. The report, published by the University of NSW and commissioned by the Redfern Legal Centre, warns imprecise legal thresholds defining when an officer is able to conduct a strip-search means unlawful use of the practice is \u201cpotentially widespread\u201d. It cites evidence that in some cases officers use invasive searches to \u201cpunish and humiliate\u201d people, and is littered with case studies of people subject to them on suspect grounds. Those case studies include Zac, a 12-year-old in a regional town who told his school principal he had been stopped by police outside a supermarket and made to pull down his pants and stand in his underwear in front of his friends. Nothing was found. And Emma, a woman in her late teens who was strip-searched at a music festival despite merely being sniffed by a drug dogs. Again, nothing was found, but Emma was forced to leave the festival and the search, she said, triggered memories of a past sexual assault. \u201cI felt the same feelings I felt during that assault,\u201d she said. Advocates have long argued that the wording around strip-searches is too vague, leading to misuse. Under the Law Enforcement Powers and Responsibilities Act, NSW police are allowed to conduct a strip-search outside a police station if the \u201cseriousness and urgency of the circumstances\u201d make it necessary. But, the report\u2019s authors argue, that \u201cbroadly defined\u201d threshold fails to give police clear guidance on when a strip-search should be carried out, meaning many are conducted without adequate legal grounds. \u201cOverall, the legislative framework and guidance to police supports the approach that strip-searches are intended to be a last resort for use in exceptional circumstances,\u201d the report sats. \u201cHowever, there is ambiguity and police practice has evolved in ways that depart from parliament\u2019s intent that strip-searches be a last resort and only in serious and urgent circumstances; particularly in relation to policing suspected drug possession.\u201d In fact, the report found that in the 2017-18 financial year suspicion that a person was in possession of a prohibited drug accounted for 91% of all recorded reasons for why police conduct a strip-search. It found that only 30% of all strip-searches conducted outside of police stations in 2017 and 2018 resulted in charges. Of those, almost 82% were for drug possession offences. The report\u2019s authors state that \u201cavailable evidence\u201d suggests the increased use of drug dogs accounts for the massive increase in the use of strip-searches, even though a positive detection from a dog does not constitute the legal criteria for conducting one. About 20% of all strip-searches in 2017 occurred as a result of a positive indication from a drug detection dog, \u201cbut the law and the NSW police special operating procedures require police to have a reasonable suspicion based on more than just a positive indication from a dog before a person is searched on suspicion of drug offences\u201d, the report states. \u201cSaturation policing with sniffer dogs at music festivals and railway stations or forcing teenagers to remove their clothes in the back of police vans does not make the community safer,\u201d said one of the report\u2019s co-authors, the UNSW lecturer Vicki Sentas. \u201cWe need a serious discussion about how best to reform the law so that the police cannot abuse their powers.\u201d The use of strip-searches in NSW has been subject to widespread criticism and scrutiny. Last year the police watchdog, the Law Enforcement Conduct Commission, announced it was holding an inquiry into allegations police had abused their strip-search powers. Evidence showed the number conducted by police had doubled. And last month, at an inquest into MDMA-related deaths at music festivals, the counsel assisting the coroner Peggy Dwyer said she would push for the release of police protocols on when strip-searches could be carried out. The report also details case studies which, the authors say, show police can use strip-searches \u201cto intimidate targeted groups in the knowledge that there is rarely a serious sanction in the event of an unlawful or improper exercise of power\u201d. A Redfern Legal Centre solicitor, Samantha Lee, said the \u201cextraordinary rise\u201d in strip-searches showed the law was \u201cnot being applied as parliament intended \u2013 as a last resort\u201d. \u201cStrip-searches are an invasive, humiliating and harmful process, and as such, should be only used in exceptional circumstances when no other alternative is available,\u201d she said. \u201cUpdating police education and training material will not suffice. Clear guidance about police strip-search procedure needs to be driven by clear and rigorous law.

In a brief statement, the Vatican reiterated that Pell maintained his innocence and that it was now his \u201cright to appeal to the high court\u201d. \u201cAt this time, together with the church in Australia, the Holy See confirms its closeness to the victims of sexual abuse,\u201d the statement also said. No mention was made of stripping Pell of his cardinal title.</p> <p><strong>Queensland Labor is set to endorse a change to its official platform to become more coal friendly</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/aug/22/queensland-labor-to-change-its-official-platform-in-coal-friendly-revamp\">asserting the party\u2019s support for the mining industry and its importance to the state</a>. Delegates from Labor\u2019s industrial left, and from the party\u2019s right faction, are expected to overwhelmingly support a proposal at this weekend\u2019s state conference, to be attended by the federal Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, to add a new chapter to the party\u2019s official platform. The move to highlight support for the coal sector comes after Labor suffered a statewide swing against it of more than 4% in the May federal election.</p> <p><strong>The energy market operator has used its latest 10-year forecast of reliability in Australia\u2019s power supply to highlight the urgent need for more investment in dispatchable energy and transmission infrastructure.</strong> In a frank assessment, the chief executive of Aemo, Audrey Zibelman, says <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/aug/22/energy-market-operator-calls-for-urgent-investment-in-dispatchable-power\">the energy market operator has been engaged in \u201creactive action\u201d</a> to ensure the risks of blackouts are reduced during the summer peaks. But she points out that current methods of securing additional resources are imposing higher costs on consumers. </p> <p><strong>Discrimination is the most significant factor driving the gender pay gap in Australia,</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/22/gender-pay-gap-discrimination-found-to-be-most-significant-contributor-to-inequality\">according to a </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/22/gender-pay-gap-discrimination-found-to-be-most-significant-contributor-to-inequality\"> report by KPMG</a>.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Stephen Smiley bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Thursday 22 August. Top stories The Vatican has invoked Cardinal George Pell\u2019s \u201cright to appeal\u201d, after the most senior Catholic cleric in the world to be convicted of child sexual abuse on Wednesday lost his bid to have his conviction quashed. In a brief statement, the Vatican reiterated that Pell maintained his innocence and that it was now his \u201cright to appeal to the high court\u201d. \u201cAt this time, together with the church in Australia, the Holy See confirms its closeness to the victims of sexual abuse,\u201d the statement also said. No mention was made of stripping Pell of his cardinal title. Queensland Labor is set to endorse a change to its official platform to become more coal friendly, asserting the party\u2019s support for the mining industry and its importance to the state. Delegates from Labor\u2019s industrial left, and from the party\u2019s right faction, are expected to overwhelmingly support a proposal at this weekend\u2019s state conference, to be attended by the federal Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, to add a new chapter to the party\u2019s official platform. The move to highlight support for the coal sector comes after Labor suffered a statewide swing against it of more than 4% in the May federal election. The energy market operator has used its latest 10-year forecast of reliability in Australia\u2019s power supply to highlight the urgent need for more investment in dispatchable energy and transmission infrastructure. In a frank assessment, the chief executive of Aemo, Audrey Zibelman, says the energy market operator has been engaged in \u201creactive action\u201d to ensure the risks of blackouts are reduced during the summer peaks. But she points out that current methods of securing additional resources are imposing higher costs on consumers. Discrimination is the most significant factor driving the gender pay gap in Australia, according to a report by KPMG. Researchers attributed gender discrimination to 39% of the gender pay gap, and noted its influence on the gap has increased since 2014. Other factors include: years of not working because of interruptions, primarily child care and caring for elderly relatives \u2013 which made a 25% contribution; and occupational and industrial segregation \u2013 meaning unequal distribution of men and women in occupations and the over-representation of women in lower paid positions and industries \u2013 which accounted for 17%. World The Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, has said she is surprised and disappointed that Donald Trump has called off his planned visit to the country, after Copenhagen refused to sell Greenland to the US. Many Danes had assumed the story of Trump\u2019s desire to buy the island was meant in jest, but he appears to have been serious \u2013 or at least offended by how firmly it has been rebuffed. Angela Merkel has challenged Boris Johnson to come up with a solution to avert a no-deal Brexit \u201cin the next 30 days\u201d, signalling cautious optimism that a deal could still be struck. Brazil\u2019s President Jair Bolsonaro has accused environmental groups of setting fire to the Amazon, as he tries to deflect growing international criticism of his failure to protect the world\u2019s biggest rainforest. An Iranian-backed militia in Iraq has accused the US and Israel of involvement in an alleged drone strike on a munitions warehouse near Baghdad, the latest in a series of mysterious explosions at similar bases. And Africa is on the verge of being declared polio-free, after three years without any recorded cases. Nigeria marked three years without a wild polio case yesterday, which the World Health Organization described as a \u201cmajor milestone\u201d. Opinion and analysis In 1971 the Liberal Billy McMahon \u2013 routinely judged the worst Australian prime minister in history, an achievement not to be underestimated in a nation where the worst routinely rule \u2013 created a new portfolio: Environment, Arts and Aboriginal Affairs.

The meeting rooms at law firm Gilbert + Tobin, high in the Barangaroo complex in Sydney, are named after historically significant locations. It\u2019s an apt place to interview the former Matildas vice captain Moya Dodd, now a partner at the firm: she has been a firsthand observer of countless significant moments in football.

Coming up Bernard Collaery, the lawyer for the former spy Witness K when he blew the whistle on Australia\u2019s bugging of Timor-Leste\u2019s cabinet discussions, is due in the ACT supreme court as he fights the charge against him. The former military lawyer David McBride is also due to reappear at the same court facing charges for leaking sensitive documents to the ABC.

      "body": "<p>There has been a distinctly upbeat tone in English cricket during the short leadup to the Headingley Test. For once, the local bowlers do not have to worry about dismissing Steve Smith, the man who has sacked them for 10 Ashes centuries since his first in 2013, but will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/20/steve-smith-ruled-out-third-ashes-test-concussion-australia-cricket\" title=\"\">sit out this week</a> with concussion. England have the cause of that concussion on their side, in the fast bowler Jofra Archer. And, with an hour\u2019s less rain the Lord\u2019s draw could have been an England win, which is an encouraging way to leave a stalemate.</p> <p>Like the Swiss flag, each of those is a big plus. But the talk of momentum shifting implies an equal transference between the two teams; a system where energy is finite and can only change location or state. The analogy doesn\u2019t account for two separate systems. England may have gained pep, but that doesn\u2019t mean Australia had to lose it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/21/third-ashes-test-headingley-england-australia-cricket-roy\">Joe Root\u2019s England fired up to burst through \u2018huge hole\u2019 in Australia</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Archer\u2019s fast and furious visit to Lord\u2019s probably left its deepest impression locally. Or to put it another way, England\u2019s shock at having a fast bowler is much greater than Australia\u2019s shock at facing one. A handful of Englishmen have had their moments with the speed gun but precious few in living memory, and none with Archer\u2019s casual, coiled ease. Never with the swagger, the quiet surety, the coolness in every sense that in three months has turned a debutant into an Ashes threat and a World Cup finisher.</p> <p>Archer is undoubtedly special: his high release point and the whip through his delivery mean he gets steep bounce from a fuller length. Or on a slow wicket such as Lord\u2019s, some balls bounce lower. Combine the two and getting out of the way becomes a nightmare. We saw this when he sconed Hashim Amla in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/may/30/england-south-africa-cricket-world-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">World Cup opener</a> before the South African champion had fully scratched his guard.</p> <p>But in Australian cricket, plenty of express bowlers roll in and let it rip. Passing 90mph is a point of pride, not a unicorn sighting. Facing it is a batsman\u2019s job. An English mind may be confounded by how to face what one can\u2019t conceive of. For an Australian cricketer the problem of Archer is technical, not existential.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eba6aa88e2a8b330b886ad9bcbea8abb2485dfb1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eba6aa88e2a8b330b886ad9bcbea8abb2485dfb1/0_32_4300_2580/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jofra Archer\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jofra Archer\u2019s pace should not overwhelm Australian batsmen used to facing 90mph deliveries at home.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mitchell Gunn/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The magnitude of losing Smith cannot be understated. After missing nearly 18 months of Test cricket he returned in this series like an avenging demon. He stitched together some batting first up in Birmingham that was especially threadbare, then returned to do the early digging that let others prosper later. At Lord\u2019s another innings was falling away and only he could move it near parity.</p> <p>Three innings for 378 runs had Smith comfortably pacing Bradman\u2019s 974 from the 1930 series, while England as a team and as a country were fast developing a similar obsession with whether or not he was out.

      "bodyText": "There has been a distinctly upbeat tone in English cricket during the short leadup to the Headingley Test. For once, the local bowlers do not have to worry about dismissing Steve Smith, the man who has sacked them for 10 Ashes centuries since his first in 2013, but will sit out this week with concussion. England have the cause of that concussion on their side, in the fast bowler Jofra Archer. And, with an hour\u2019s less rain the Lord\u2019s draw could have been an England win, which is an encouraging way to leave a stalemate. Like the Swiss flag, each of those is a big plus. But the talk of momentum shifting implies an equal transference between the two teams; a system where energy is finite and can only change location or state. The analogy doesn\u2019t account for two separate systems. England may have gained pep, but that doesn\u2019t mean Australia had to lose it. Archer\u2019s fast and furious visit to Lord\u2019s probably left its deepest impression locally. Or to put it another way, England\u2019s shock at having a fast bowler is much greater than Australia\u2019s shock at facing one. A handful of Englishmen have had their moments with the speed gun but precious few in living memory, and none with Archer\u2019s casual, coiled ease. Never with the swagger, the quiet surety, the coolness in every sense that in three months has turned a debutant into an Ashes threat and a World Cup finisher. Archer is undoubtedly special: his high release point and the whip through his delivery mean he gets steep bounce from a fuller length. Or on a slow wicket such as Lord\u2019s, some balls bounce lower. Combine the two and getting out of the way becomes a nightmare. We saw this when he sconed Hashim Amla in the World Cup opener before the South African champion had fully scratched his guard. But in Australian cricket, plenty of express bowlers roll in and let it rip. Passing 90mph is a point of pride, not a unicorn sighting. Facing it is a batsman\u2019s job. An English mind may be confounded by how to face what one can\u2019t conceive of. For an Australian cricketer the problem of Archer is technical, not existential. The magnitude of losing Smith cannot be understated. After missing nearly 18 months of Test cricket he returned in this series like an avenging demon. He stitched together some batting first up in Birmingham that was especially threadbare, then returned to do the early digging that let others prosper later. At Lord\u2019s another innings was falling away and only he could move it near parity. Three innings for 378 runs had Smith comfortably pacing Bradman\u2019s 974 from the 1930 series, while England as a team and as a country were fast developing a similar obsession with whether or not he was out. While Smith has made 378 the other 10 batsmen across those innings have made 515. But foremost in calming any likely Australian nerves will be the corresponding cool that Marnus Labuschagne showed in replacing Smith in the previous Test. Being substituted in to replace one of history\u2019s best batsmen at the peak of his powers is a decent serve of pressure, and being welcomed to the crease by an Archer uppercut to the grille probably supersized that serving. Yet undeterred, the very junior player in the squad scoffed the lot, outlasting Archer\u2019s barrage at the cost of a number of bruises but toughing it out to make sure that Australia\u2019s 1-0 scoreline did not suffer any injury. Already in glorious form in the County Championship this season, Labuschagne had that intangible quality of immediately looking like a Test cricketer. His innings of 59 was by far the most composed in the chase, and there will be plenty of confidence that he can repeat the display as part of the starting XI. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can be disappointed, my job is to work with guys who are playing,\u201d was the Australia captain, Tim Paine\u2019s, take on losing his star batsman. \u201cObviously they\u2019re huge shoes to fill but it doesn\u2019t just come down to Marnus. It\u2019s up to the whole team to lift their output 5% or 10%, and if we can do that then I think as a group we can cover Steve\u2019s absence and win this Test match.\u201d If that happens, Australia will retain the Ashes with two Tests to spare. England do not have to win but cannot afford to give another win away. Australia in 2013 had two almost certain wins ruined by rain, and let slip winning positions in two other matches. It doesn\u2019t change a loss that history views as a decisive 3-0. Once play starts, mood and momentum and all the other intangibles don\u2019t matter.

The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the \u00a339bn divorce payment.</p>\n    <p>The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods.</p>\n    <p>The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports \u2013 making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO \u201cmost favoured nation\u201d rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.<br></p>\n    <p>WTO rules only cover goods \u2013 they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK\u2019s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.<br></p>\n    <p>Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article 24 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to 10 years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article 24 unilaterally \u2013 the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK\u2019s trading relationship.<br></p>\n    <p>The director general of the WTO, Roberto Azev\u00eado, has <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/economics-and-finance/jumping-from-league-one-to-league-three-wto-insiders-scathing-assessments-of-a-wto-brexit\">told Prospect magazine</a> that \u201cin simple factual terms in this scenario, you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the UK and EU where currently there are none\u201d.</p>\n    <p>Until some agreements are in place, a no-deal scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses \u2013 eg the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europe after 31 October if there is no deal. Those arguing for a \u201cmanaged\u201d no deal envisage that a range of smaller, sector-by-sector, bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.</p>\n    <p><b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a></b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>And he dismissed any suggestion that the EU would be to blame for a no-deal exit. \u201cIt will be the responsibility of the British government, always, because firstly it was the British people that decided Brexit, and the British government has the possibility up to the last second to revoke article 50,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>He said he was waiting for \u201cclarification\u201d on several issues from Johnson.</p> \n<p>Throughout the Brexit negotiations, Merkel has often sought a politer, more positive tone towards Britain than those carried by the soundbites coming out of Paris. Once stripped of their rhetoric, however, the two countries\u2019 positions have so far been closely aligned.</p> \n<p>And behind her optimistic phrasing on Wednesday lay the same cold reality that Germany and the rest of the EU are unwilling to countenance Britain\u2019s desire to reopen the withdrawal agreement.</p> \n<p>Merkel\u2019s intervention appeared intended to nudge Johnson towards exploring potential for compromise in the political declaration, the second component of the Brexit deal negotiated by Theresa May. Currently only in draft form, it outlines the future trade and security relationship between the UK and the EU.</p> \n<p>While the political declaration is not legally binding, Merkel seemed to suggest that a reformulation of the text could render the controversial backstop unnecessary, possibly by positing a closer relationship.</p> \n<p>When pressed on how the UK could come up with a solution in such a short time period, Johnson struggled to provide a specific proposal that would avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. His only suggestion was drawing on the work of the non-governmental Alternative Arrangements Commission, involving some checks away from the border and trusted trader schemes, which it claims could be ready in three years.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe do think there are alternative arrangements that could readily be used to address the problem of frictionless trade at the Northern Irish border and you\u2019ll have heard them before, whether it is trusted trader schemes or electronic pre-clearing. All that type of solution and more besides is what we will be wanting to discuss,\u201d Johnson said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"47fa487d8859310b6df79fe0f2fd678557d135be\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/47fa487d8859310b6df79fe0f2fd678557d135be/0_83_3418_2051/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson and Angela Merkel\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The pair sit for the national anthems in Berlin.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Filip Singer/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Asked if a time limit to the backstop could point the way to a compromise between the negotiating side, Johnson said \u201cthere are other flaws to the backstop\u201d.</p> \n<p>Earlier, as the visit got under way, Johnson and Merkel walked down the red carpet to chants of \u201cNo to Brexit\u201d from mostly British protesters gathered outside the gates of the chancellery.</p> \n<p>With the military band playing the German and British anthems, the pair sat rather than stood, as has become customary for Merkel since she suffered bouts of shaking during military honours earlier this summer.</p> \n<p>Over a working dinner of tuna tartare, saddle of venison and chocolate tart, the pair said they would discuss geopolitical issues ranging from Russia, Iran, China, the protests in Hong Kong and \u2013 in Johnson\u2019s words \u2013 \u201cthe small matter of Brexit\u201d.</p> \n<p>Merkel emphasised that Germany accepted Britain\u2019s decision to depart from the bloc of nations as \u201ca fact\u201d. While Germany hoped for a negotiated exit, the chancellor said, \u201cwe are also prepared for the eventuality that there won\u2019t be such a negotiated exit\u201d, specifically drawing attention to consequences no-deal Brexit could have for British citizens across the EU.</p> \n<p>Reiterating the content of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/19/eu-unconvinced-as-boris-johnson-sets-out-fresh-bid-to-remove-brexit-backstop\">the letter he sent to the president of the European </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/19/eu-unconvinced-as-boris-johnson-sets-out-fresh-bid-to-remove-brexit-backstop\">council, Donald Tusk, on Monday</a>, Johnson said, \u201cWe cannot accept the current withdrawal agreement\u201d, but that his government was \u201cabsolutely dedicated\u201d to honour the rights of EU citizens in Britain and that his government would \u201cunder no circumstances\u201d introduce checks on the Irish border.</p> \n<p>Speaking after a meeting with the Slovakian president, Zuzana \u010caputov\u00e1, in Berlin, German president Frank-Walter Steinmeier earlier in the day voiced pessimism about the chances of constructive talks with the new British prime minister.</p> \n<p>Regarding the backstop, Steinmeier said \u201call variations that could now be put on the table\u201d had already been discussed in talks. \u201cI therefore think it unlikely that negotiations [on the backstop] will get off the ground\u201d.</p> \n<p>Macron meanwhile claimed that there was currently a \u201cBritish democratic crisis\u201d over Brexit: \u201cThe British were asked to choose, in perhaps a simplistic way, without the government telling them how it would be done. Many lied about how it would be done, and democracy couldn\u2019t find a majority to apply what people decided. It\u2019s unheard of, but that\u2019s what we\u2019re living. We have to help the British deal with this internal democratic crisis, but we mustn\u2019t be hostage to it nor export it.\u201d </p>",

After weeks of diplomatic tension, the German chancellor used her first face-to-face meeting with her UK counterpart on Wednesday to emphasise that Britain still has the power to resolve the crisis, suggesting that the backstop was \u201ca placeholder that will no longer be necessary\u201d if a solution to the impasse over the Irish border can be found. But her comments were set against a backdrop of pessimism in France ahead of Johnson\u2019s trip there on Thursday, with officials warning that Paris now views a no-deal Brexit as \u201cthe most likely outcome\u201d and president Emmanuel Macron emphasising that a renegotiation at this point \u201cis not an option\u201d. Saying that changes to the political declaration could yet provide a way forward, Merkel added an agreement could take two years \u201cbut maybe we can find that solution in the next 30 days\u201d. Her remarks came on day one of Johnson\u2019s crucial visit to Berlin and Paris, his first overseas trip since he entered No 10. In response to Merkel\u2019s overture, Johnson sought to convey a willingness to compromise in his appearance with Merkel, saying that he was \u201cglad\u201d to hear his German counterpart setting such a \u201cblistering timetable\u201d, and adding \u201cWir schaffen das (\u201cWe will manage\u201d), the same phrase Merkel famously used to sound determined in the middle of the 2015 refugee crisis. Both leaders agreed the onus was on the UK to come up with a way to square Britain\u2019s desire to leave the EU with the need to avert a hard border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, as set out in the Good Friday agreement. Merkel\u2019s attempt to give new impetus to the talks is likely to be challenged immediately on Thursday with Johnson\u2019s visit to France widely seen as unlikely to yield significant progress. Ahead of the meeting with Macron and the weekend\u2019s G7 summit, a French official said: \u201cIf the UK considers that having a backstop is absolutely excluded, that is its right, but in that case it limits the possibility of reaching an agreement.\u201d The official added: \u201cThe idea of saying, \u2018There\u2019s not a deal, so I won\u2019t pay\u2019 does not work. We cannot imagine that a country like the UK would back out of an international commitment.\u201d Later, Macron flatly dismissed demands from Johnson to renegotiate the UK\u2019s exit from the EU, saying it was \u201cnot an option\u201d. He said scrapping the Irish backstop was impossible and would mean giving the EU an unacceptable choice between protecting its internal market by reintroducing border controls at the Irish border, or preserving peace on the island. Macron insisted that Europe would not risk peace in Ireland and that it would be \u201cirresponsible\u201d to do so: \u201cWe must all remember recent history \u2013 there was war in this part of Europe until recently and those who play with that forget history too fast.\u201d And he dismissed any suggestion that the EU would be to blame for a no-deal exit. \u201cIt will be the responsibility of the British government, always, because firstly it was the British people that decided Brexit, and the British government has the possibility up to the last second to revoke article 50,\u201d he said. He said he was waiting for \u201cclarification\u201d on several issues from Johnson. Throughout the Brexit negotiations, Merkel has often sought a politer, more positive tone towards Britain than those carried by the soundbites coming out of Paris. Once stripped of their rhetoric, however, the two countries\u2019 positions have so far been closely aligned. And behind her optimistic phrasing on Wednesday lay the same cold reality that Germany and the rest of the EU are unwilling to countenance Britain\u2019s desire to reopen the withdrawal agreement. Merkel\u2019s intervention appeared intended to nudge Johnson towards exploring potential for compromise in the political declaration, the second component of the Brexit deal negotiated by Theresa May. Currently only in draft form, it outlines the future trade and security relationship between the UK and the EU. While the political declaration is not legally binding, Merkel seemed to suggest that a reformulation of the text could render the controversial backstop unnecessary, possibly by positing a closer relationship. When pressed on how the UK could come up with a solution in such a short time period, Johnson struggled to provide a specific proposal that would avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. His only suggestion was drawing on the work of the non-governmental Alternative Arrangements Commission, involving some checks away from the border and trusted trader schemes, which it claims could be ready in three years. \u201cWe do think there are alternative arrangements that could readily be used to address the problem of frictionless trade at the Northern Irish border and you\u2019ll have heard them before, whether it is trusted trader schemes or electronic pre-clearing. All that type of solution and more besides is what we will be wanting to discuss,\u201d Johnson said. Asked if a time limit to the backstop could point the way to a compromise between the negotiating side, Johnson said \u201cthere are other flaws to the backstop\u201d. Earlier, as the visit got under way, Johnson and Merkel walked down the red carpet to chants of \u201cNo to Brexit\u201d from mostly British protesters gathered outside the gates of the chancellery. With the military band playing the German and British anthems, the pair sat rather than stood, as has become customary for Merkel since she suffered bouts of shaking during military honours earlier this summer. Over a working dinner of tuna tartare, saddle of venison and chocolate tart, the pair said they would discuss geopolitical issues ranging from Russia, Iran, China, the protests in Hong Kong and \u2013 in Johnson\u2019s words \u2013 \u201cthe small matter of Brexit\u201d. Merkel emphasised that Germany accepted Britain\u2019s decision to depart from the bloc of nations as \u201ca fact\u201d. While Germany hoped for a negotiated exit, the chancellor said, \u201cwe are also prepared for the eventuality that there won\u2019t be such a negotiated exit\u201d, specifically drawing attention to consequences no-deal Brexit could have for British citizens across the EU. Reiterating the content of the letter he sent to the president of the European council, Donald Tusk, on Monday, Johnson said, \u201cWe cannot accept the current withdrawal agreement\u201d, but that his government was \u201cabsolutely dedicated\u201d to honour the rights of EU citizens in Britain and that his government would \u201cunder no circumstances\u201d introduce checks on the Irish border. Speaking after a meeting with the Slovakian president, Zuzana \u010caputov\u00e1, in Berlin, German president Frank-Walter Steinmeier earlier in the day voiced pessimism about the chances of constructive talks with the new British prime minister. Regarding the backstop, Steinmeier said \u201call variations that could now be put on the table\u201d had already been discussed in talks. \u201cI therefore think it unlikely that negotiations [on the backstop] will get off the ground\u201d. Macron meanwhile claimed that there was currently a \u201cBritish democratic crisis\u201d over Brexit: \u201cThe British were asked to choose, in perhaps a simplistic way, without the government telling them how it would be done. Many lied about how it would be done, and democracy couldn\u2019t find a majority to apply what people decided. It\u2019s unheard of, but that\u2019s what we\u2019re living. We have to help the British deal with this internal democratic crisis, but we mustn\u2019t be hostage to it nor export it.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "National Grid plans to stabilise the energy grid by plugging into new technology after raising concerns a year ago that it may be \u201cwalking blind\u201d into the risk of blackouts. The energy system operator is under investigation by the industry regulator, and the government, after Britain\u2019s biggest blackout in more than a decade struck large parts of England and Wales on 9 August. The system operator revealed that it had been running the risk of blackouts over a year before the outage, which cut electricity to almost a million homes. To safeguard the system it has been working on a series of software agreements with companies including the US giant General Electric (GE) to replace its spreadsheet models, which provide estimates of the grid\u2019s stability. National Grid is understood to be close to announcing a deal with GE to measure energy system \u201cinertia\u201d, or the energy buffer that helps to keep frequency stable, following a separate deal with another technology firm for similar software in August. A National Grid spokesman said the initiatives are the first of their kind anywhere in the world, and will be incorporated \u201cover the coming years\u201d. The FTSE 100 company has invested about \u00a310bn in modernising the grid over the past six years but industry sources fear that its efforts are not coming fast enough to adapt to the quicker-than-expected rollout of new energy technologies. The deals have emerged after a senior National Grid executive revealed last July that the company was \u201cwalking blind\u201d because it cannot measure the stability of the grid. Duncan Burt, the operations head, said: \u201cIf we don\u2019t know if the grid is secure, then we are walking blind into operating scenarios that we don\u2019t understand well.

Renan Giovanini, an analytics manager at GE, said the new systems will \u201chelp to reduce the likelihood of a blackout\u201d by evolving the tools National Grid uses to assess the energy grid. National Grid has blamed lightning strikes for triggering a series of power-plant outages on 9 August, leading to a sharp fall in the system\u2019s frequency, which caused the blackout.

The energy system\u2019s inertia is typically lower than it was 10 years ago following the move from large-scale fossil-fuel plants to renewable energy projects, which is making it more difficult to maintain healthy inertia and frequency. A spokesman for National Grid said its systems \u201care appropriate\u201d for the levels of wind and solar power in operation but the company plans to \u201cembrace new technologies\u201d by 2025 when it wants to be able to run a carbon-free system. \u2022 Sign up to the daily Business Today email here or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk.",

The schoolboy, from Lostock Gralam in Cheshire, was on holiday with his mother Nicola Marshall and a friend in the Costa del Sol resort of Fuengirola when he fell on Tuesday afternoon. Police said the death was being treated as an accident.

      "body": "<p>The last time Americans felt hostility to anything remotely Danish was when the pompous old Duke of Weselton launched a trade-war-turned-palace-coup against the warm-hearted ice queen known as Elsa. Even the prepubescent fans of Frozen know that trade wars are doomed and that strong female leaders are unstoppable.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s tempting to look at Donald Trump\u2019s ludicrous desire to buy Greenland \u2013 and the Danish spat that followed \u2013 as just another sick joke of the Trump presidency: an aberration that the world will forget with tomorrow\u2019s distracting tweets on some other outrage.</p> \n<p>But after two and half years of this corrosive nonsense, it\u2019s time to admit some unpleasant truths. The madness of Donald Trump is getting worse, not better. The presidency has not normalized him, it has only normalized our numbed reaction to his excesses. We cannot see through the fog of disinformation and distraction how much of the world\u2019s instability is directly linked to his abject failure as a president.</p> \n<p>Let\u2019s just pause to look at Greenland, shall we? On the face of it, the notion of buying the Arctic autonomous territory seems like just another brain fart from the cavities inside Trump\u2019s cranium: \u201can absurd discussion\u201d, as the new Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, <a href=\"https://www.apnews.com/37da8cbadb39488d87154ce820da43c2\">put it</a> on her trip to Greenland on Monday. \u201cThankfully the time where you buy and sell countries and populations is over. Let\u2019s leave it there. Jokes aside, we will of course love to have an even closer strategic relationship with the United States.\u201d</p> \n<p>Sadly, the days of buying and selling other countries are far from over because Trump himself seems to be easily bought by his Russian and Saudi friends. He\u2019s so cheap you only have to dangle the idea of a Trump Tower in Moscow to win his undying support for <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/29/us/politics/trump-cohen-russia-sanctions.html\">lifting sanctions</a> imposed after Russia invaded and annexed part of Ukraine.</p> \n<p>Greenland doesn\u2019t just bubble into Trump\u2019s mind randomly, unless Fox News is airing obscure weekend segments on Arctic politics. But it is very much on Russia\u2019s radar. Earlier this year, Russia <a href=\"https://www.apnews.com/44c182c68f85475bb828942b53042b19\">revamped</a> its Arctic circle military base on the tiny Kotelny Island, which sits close to the shipping routes that are opening up as the polar region warms catastrophically.</p> \n<p>There are unknown quantities of oil, gas and rare earth metals in the arctic, and the region\u2019s powers \u2013 Denmark among them \u2013 can either green light a global free-for-all or restrain the usual human plunder of one of the last pristine frontiers on the planet. You can guess where Russia sits on this spectrum of environmental concerns in the middle of our climate crisis.</p> \n<p>It is one of the sickest Trump jokes that his half-baked idea of buying Greenland should be seen as American machismo when it is yet another sign of Putin\u2019s <a href=\"https://beta.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/01/14/like-i-said-puppet-hillary-clinton-doubles-down-trump-russia/\">puppet</a> American presidency at work.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"709d6da4-224f-4834-9494-358deacb46e9\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZUjw6SovjCw?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Denmark is a loyal ally within the organization that Russia loathes: Nato. So the downside to trashing a state visit, complete with a royal dinner, is not what it normally would be for an American president who supposedly leads the greatest global alliance in military history. He did, after all, suggest <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/14/us/politics/nato-president-trump.html\">withdrawing</a> US troops from Nato just last year.</p> \n<p>One of the many gobsmacking cons of our current crop of so-called nationalist leaders is how happy they are to surrender their national interest in subordination to any foreign strongman who offers to grease their personal interest. It\u2019s almost like they\u2019re not serious about America First or Global Britain at all.</p> \n<p>It is too much to expect rational public thought from the 45th president of the United States. But you have to wonder if he ever admits to himself that the only reason the Arctic is opening up is because of the climate crisis he used to call a Chinese hoax.</p> \n<p>More recently he <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-full-interview-60-minutes-transcript-lesley-stahl-2018-10-14/\">told</a> CBS News that \u201csomething\u2019s happening\u201d to the climate that probably isn\u2019t a hoax but definitely has nothing to do with human actions.</p> \n<p>\u201cI wish you could go to Greenland, watch these huge chunks of ice just falling into the ocean, raising the sea levels,\u201d Lesley Stahl of 60 Minutes told him. Maybe Trump just wanted to buy Greenland to make sure nobody could there to see the ice melting.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou\u2019d have to show me the scientists because they have a very big political agenda, Lesley,\u201d Trump said, fabricating yet more lies to cover up his own political agenda. In other words, another day in the Oval Office.</p> \n<p>As the world knows full well with each passing day of this presidency, Trump cannot project national strength because he is so chronically, personally weak. He told reporters on Wednesday that he dropped out of his Denmark state visit because its prime minister was \u201cnasty\u201d and \u201cnot nice\u201d in rejecting his advances on Greenland.</p> \n<p>On a playground full of pre-schoolers, this language might make sense. On the world stage, as the Danish would say, it\u2019s absurd.</p> \n<p>Like so many weak souls who never grew out of the playground chapter of their lives, Trump tries to pick on other weak souls to demonstrate the strength he so clearly lacks.</p> \n<p>The weakest of those victims are the children fleeing for their lives from Central America.</p> \n<p>Trump is not content with ripping them from their parents, orphaning some of them by losing track of their parents forever, and exposing others to unspeakable abuse in so-called shelters. He now wants to ignore the courts and detain them <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/21/us-to-remove-limit-on-how-long-immigrant-children-can-be-detained\">indefinitely</a> in private for-profit prisons with or without their families.</p> \n<p>His administration claims the old court-ordered Flores agreement is \u201coutdated and fails to account for the massive shift in illegal immigration to families and minors from Central America\u201d, according to a written White House statement.</p> \n<p>That conveniently ignores the fact that the \u201coutdated\u201d court agreement is named after Jenny Lisette Flores, who was a 15-year-old fleeing El Salvador in the 1980s when she was arrested by US officials, handcuffed and strip-searched and placed in a for-profit prison for two months. The US refused to release her to family members, claiming they were protecting her, but the ACLU said the Reagan administration was just trying to arrest parents and punish children.</p> \n<p>So obviously there are no similarities to Trump\u2019s policies at all.</p> \n<p>From the self-inflicted crisis at the border to the self-inflicted spat with Denmark, so much of the global chaos that numbs us all is the product of this mindless and malignant American leader.</p> \n<p>The world is staring at a global recession triggered in large part by Trump\u2019s pointless trade wars.

      "bodyText": "The last time Americans felt hostility to anything remotely Danish was when the pompous old Duke of Weselton launched a trade-war-turned-palace-coup against the warm-hearted ice queen known as Elsa. Even the prepubescent fans of Frozen know that trade wars are doomed and that strong female leaders are unstoppable. It\u2019s tempting to look at Donald Trump\u2019s ludicrous desire to buy Greenland \u2013 and the Danish spat that followed \u2013 as just another sick joke of the Trump presidency: an aberration that the world will forget with tomorrow\u2019s distracting tweets on some other outrage. But after two and half years of this corrosive nonsense, it\u2019s time to admit some unpleasant truths. The madness of Donald Trump is getting worse, not better. The presidency has not normalized him, it has only normalized our numbed reaction to his excesses. We cannot see through the fog of disinformation and distraction how much of the world\u2019s instability is directly linked to his abject failure as a president. Let\u2019s just pause to look at Greenland, shall we? On the face of it, the notion of buying the Arctic autonomous territory seems like just another brain fart from the cavities inside Trump\u2019s cranium: \u201can absurd discussion\u201d, as the new Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, put it on her trip to Greenland on Monday. \u201cThankfully the time where you buy and sell countries and populations is over. Let\u2019s leave it there. Jokes aside, we will of course love to have an even closer strategic relationship with the United States.\u201d Sadly, the days of buying and selling other countries are far from over because Trump himself seems to be easily bought by his Russian and Saudi friends. He\u2019s so cheap you only have to dangle the idea of a Trump Tower in Moscow to win his undying support for lifting sanctions imposed after Russia invaded and annexed part of Ukraine. Greenland doesn\u2019t just bubble into Trump\u2019s mind randomly, unless Fox News is airing obscure weekend segments on Arctic politics. But it is very much on Russia\u2019s radar. Earlier this year, Russia revamped its Arctic circle military base on the tiny Kotelny Island, which sits close to the shipping routes that are opening up as the polar region warms catastrophically. There are unknown quantities of oil, gas and rare earth metals in the arctic, and the region\u2019s powers \u2013 Denmark among them \u2013 can either green light a global free-for-all or restrain the usual human plunder of one of the last pristine frontiers on the planet. You can guess where Russia sits on this spectrum of environmental concerns in the middle of our climate crisis. It is one of the sickest Trump jokes that his half-baked idea of buying Greenland should be seen as American machismo when it is yet another sign of Putin\u2019s puppet American presidency at work. Denmark is a loyal ally within the organization that Russia loathes: Nato. So the downside to trashing a state visit, complete with a royal dinner, is not what it normally would be for an American president who supposedly leads the greatest global alliance in military history. He did, after all, suggest withdrawing US troops from Nato just last year. One of the many gobsmacking cons of our current crop of so-called nationalist leaders is how happy they are to surrender their national interest in subordination to any foreign strongman who offers to grease their personal interest. It\u2019s almost like they\u2019re not serious about America First or Global Britain at all. It is too much to expect rational public thought from the 45th president of the United States. But you have to wonder if he ever admits to himself that the only reason the Arctic is opening up is because of the climate crisis he used to call a Chinese hoax. More recently he told CBS News that \u201csomething\u2019s happening\u201d to the climate that probably isn\u2019t a hoax but definitely has nothing to do with human actions. \u201cI wish you could go to Greenland, watch these huge chunks of ice just falling into the ocean, raising the sea levels,\u201d Lesley Stahl of 60 Minutes told him. Maybe Trump just wanted to buy Greenland to make sure nobody could there to see the ice melting. \u201cYou\u2019d have to show me the scientists because they have a very big political agenda, Lesley,\u201d Trump said, fabricating yet more lies to cover up his own political agenda. In other words, another day in the Oval Office. As the world knows full well with each passing day of this presidency, Trump cannot project national strength because he is so chronically, personally weak. He told reporters on Wednesday that he dropped out of his Denmark state visit because its prime minister was \u201cnasty\u201d and \u201cnot nice\u201d in rejecting his advances on Greenland. On a playground full of pre-schoolers, this language might make sense. On the world stage, as the Danish would say, it\u2019s absurd. Like so many weak souls who never grew out of the playground chapter of their lives, Trump tries to pick on other weak souls to demonstrate the strength he so clearly lacks. The weakest of those victims are the children fleeing for their lives from Central America. Trump is not content with ripping them from their parents, orphaning some of them by losing track of their parents forever, and exposing others to unspeakable abuse in so-called shelters. He now wants to ignore the courts and detain them indefinitely in private for-profit prisons with or without their families. His administration claims the old court-ordered Flores agreement is \u201coutdated and fails to account for the massive shift in illegal immigration to families and minors from Central America\u201d, according to a written White House statement. That conveniently ignores the fact that the \u201coutdated\u201d court agreement is named after Jenny Lisette Flores, who was a 15-year-old fleeing El Salvador in the 1980s when she was arrested by US officials, handcuffed and strip-searched and placed in a for-profit prison for two months. The US refused to release her to family members, claiming they were protecting her, but the ACLU said the Reagan administration was just trying to arrest parents and punish children. So obviously there are no similarities to Trump\u2019s policies at all. From the self-inflicted crisis at the border to the self-inflicted spat with Denmark, so much of the global chaos that numbs us all is the product of this mindless and malignant American leader. The world is staring at a global recession triggered in large part by Trump\u2019s pointless trade wars. It\u2019s watching mini-Trumps grasp for power in Britain and Italy, inspired by his own undemocratic example, including all his trademark incompetence and ignorance. Without Trump, how much of the stupefying sense of chaos would evaporate? Perhaps not all of it, but enough for Scandinavia to return to sleeping soundly. Villy S\u00f8vndal, a former Danish foreign minister, said that Trump was \u201ca narcissistic fool\u201d because of his decision to cancel his trip. But he explained that this clown wasn\u2019t funny. \u201cThe problem is that he is the president of the most powerful nation in the world,\u201d he said. That\u2019s a problem for the whole world to suffer. But it\u2019s a problem that only American voters can solve.",

The economic analysis shows in 2017 the hourly wage gap was $2.43 compared with $3.05 per hour in 2014. The Diversity Council Australia chief executive, Lisa Annese, said employers had a role to play in closing the gap but some had more power than others depending on their scale. \u201cThere\u2019s a massive discrepancy between a big global multinational which can afford to open a childcare centre versus a small business owner,\u201d she said. Annese encouraged workplaces to move to a shared care model for parental leave and offer more flexible work options. \u201cIf you are trying to get more men to take up parental leave, having senior men to role model tells other men that it\u2019s OK to actively take parental leave,\u201d Annese said. \u201cWe find even when organisations have really equitable policies around parental leave, men are still reluctant to access it. \u201cIndividuals can try to do their best to negotiate their personal circumstances but a shift in this area does require broader structural change.\u201d Workplace Gender Equality Agency director Libby Lyons said closing the gender pay gap required changing the hearts and minds of all Australians. \u201cAt the heart of each of these factors are stubborn gender stereotypes about the roles women and men play in both paid and unpaid work and family and caring responsibilities,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to challenge our blind acceptance that women\u2019s work is less valuable than men\u2019s work. We have to accept that real and lasting cultural change is required if we are going to achieve and sustain gender equality in our workplaces and in society more broadly.\u201d The gender pay gap is also contributing to an emerging problem of homelessness and financial struggles for women entering their retirement years. The national gender pay gap measures the difference between the average weekly full-time base salary earnings of both genders, expressed as a percentage of men\u2019s earnings. It is a measure of women\u2019s overall position in the paid workforce and does not compare like roles. The gender pay gap is not the difference between two people being paid differently for work of equal or comparable value, which is unlawful.",

      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s economy has long been linked with that of the United States. While we are now much more dependent upon China, the increasing heated trade war between those two nations is a great danger to not only our economy growth, but also the projections for budget surpluses so desired by the Morrison government. On 2 March last year, Donald Trump, perhaps fresh off of watching yet another 10 hours of Fox News, decided to take to Twitter to share with us his economic wisdom. It was a clear jab at China, and it presaged action six days later to raise tariffs on all steel and aluminium imports, and then in June announcing 25% tariffs on $50bn of Chinese goods, which was matched immediately by China. Trump in September added a 10% tariff on a further $200bn worth of Chinese goods with a potential to raise it to 25%. In May this year he announced (again via Twitter) that he intended to raise the tariff to 25% on $325bn worth of goods. This was followed by raising a 25% tariff for $200bn and 10% on a further $300bn worth of Chinese goods. In response China has levied a 25% tariff on $110bn worth of US products. And the impact on the US and world economy has been all bad. Back when Trump was boasting that trade wars are good and easy to win, the US Treasury bonds market was looking very healthy. The interest rate for one-month bonds was 1.5%, 2.06% for a one-year bond and 2.86% for a 10-year bond. The longer the US government wanted to borrow, the higher the level of interest it needed to pay. This was a good sign that investors expected the economy to grow solidly over those years and that the US federal reserve would likely raise interest rates to stop the economy from overheating. Now the US government can borrow for 10 years at a cheaper rate than it can for one month. In effect investors believe bad times are ahead, and the federal reserve will need to cut rates in order to pump some life into the economy: On Tuesday Trump suggested that \u201cI am doing this whether it\u2019s good or bad for your statement about, \u2018Oh, will we fall into a recession for two months?\u2019 The fact is, somebody had to take China on. Whether it\u2019s good for our country or bad for our country, short term, it had to be done.\u201d He repeated that \u201cwhether it\u2019s good or bad, short term, is irrelevant\u201d. Wow. This all comes in a week in which BHP announced a 124% rise in profits to $US8.31bn for 2018-19 and in which its chief executive, Andrew Mackenzie, told journalists that \u201cthe US-China relationship is a consideration for us. We continue to enjoy strong sales to China. But no doubt this [trade standoff] will put a dampener on world economic growth. Ultimately it will impact demand for our products.\u201d For Australia anything that hits China\u2019s economic growth is bad news given how important it is to our economy. Our merchandise exports to China totalled $133.8bn in the past financial year \u2013 some $75bn more than the exports to Japan: China now accounts for 36% of our total merchandise exports \u2013 or more than to Japan, Korea, Taiwan, the US and EU combined. Similarly, Chinese students make up more than a third of all foreign students enrolled in higher education \u2013 and more than double the number of those from the next most common nation of India. And while the volume of our exports accounts for around 22% of our GDP, over the past decade around 35% of the growth in our economy has come from exports. In effect what has happened over the past 20 years is that private investment and exports have swapped in importance \u2013 during the mining boom, investment was the key; now it is exports: It means our economic health is much more subject to conniptions in China and the US than it was prior to the GFC. And this also has a massive impact on the budget. BHP has recorded its huge rise in profits off the back of a surge in iron ore prices. Coal prices too have soared. This led to increased profits for all our major mining companies and a flow on increase in unexpected company tax revenue. In the 2017-18 budget, the government estimated that in 2018-19 financial year 19.6% of total tax revenue would come from company tax, it ended up being 20.9% - $9.1bn more than predicted. For this current financial year, the 2017-18 budget predicted company tax revenue of $91.6bn; whereas in April the budget was now predicting a further $7.3bn to $98.9bn: That all makes for a healthy budget bottom line and allowed the government to project a budget surplus for this year of $7bn. Take away that extra company tax and the surplus is no more. And so as the jitters across the world continue with the president of the United States now apparently trying to soften up his supporters for a recession that it needs to have, Australian companies and our government will hoping against hope that we don\u2019t fall into a recession because of one man\u2019s ego and economic ignorance. \u2022 Greg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia",

      "bodyText": "The Australian Medical Association has criticised the lack of resourcing for the medevac expert panel and said it must be fixed by bipartisanship on medical transfers from offshore detention. The call came in a submission by the AMA to the Senate inquiry examining the Coalition\u2019s bill to repeal the legislation, which gives clinicians a greater say in the medical transfers of asylum seekers. A number of other medical and refugee groups \u2013 including the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees \u2013 are also urging against the proposed repeal. The AMA submitted that it \u201csupports a body of clinical experts, independent of government, with the power to investigate and advise on the health and welfare of asylum seekers and refugees\u201d. But while the independent health advice panel has been a success it is also \u201csignificantly relying on the personal efforts and funding of the nominated individuals or organisations\u201d, the AMA said. \u201cThis is extremely problematic in the long run especially if the case load should increase significantly.\u201d It noted the lack of funding was caused by \u201clast minute amendments\u201d to the bill, which was legislated in the last parliament with the support of crossbenchers, Labor and the Greens at the time Scott Morrison governed in minority. The amendments removed ongoing funding to overcome the objection that the bill was unconstitutional, because the government refused to support passage of a bill with a properly funded panel. \u201cIn the absence of any other alternative independent medical panel that is demonstrably superior, the AMA affirms its support for the [independent panel], in assessing the needs of asylum seekers and refugees for transfers for medical and psychiatric assessment and treatment,\u201d the AMA said. \u201cHowever, we also want to see the [independent panel] properly resourced, including remuneration for members, recognising the workload and commitment that it involves.\u201d The RACGP said it had provided \u201cin principle support\u201d for the medevac bill and expressed \u201cits continued support of the intent of this process in Australia, including the role of the [independent panel]\u201d. The RACGP noted that applications for temporary transfers to make medical assessments \u201care being coordinated and written by volunteer doctors\u201d. It called for adequate resources to process applications, information and advice on medical indemnity and access to government-funded indemnity insurance. The UNHCR\u2019s submission stated that the \u201cdeteriorating health situation\u201d of refugees and asylum seekers in Papua New Guinea and Nauru \u201chas led to significant risks of irreparable harm and loss of life\u201d. \u201cDespite an urgent imperative for medical evacuations in a substantial number of cases, transfers to Australia were previously subject to protracted delays.\u201d The UNHCR noted that before the medevac bill some 890 people had been transferred from both countries to Australia for medical treatment, or were born in Australia to parents who were, but the system was characterised by a \u201clow level of transparency and predictability\u201d. \u201cThis has undermined confidence in critical healthcare decisions and led to multiple cases in which delayed or inadequate treatment has had tragic consequences,\u201d it said, citing the death of Hamid Khazaei. The UNHCR said the bill would \u201cexplicitly authorise the forcible return\u201d of refugees and asylum seekers to Papua New Guinea, Nauru or their country of origin, irrespective of whether they had completed care. Labor has continued to express support for the medevac procedures. The shadow home affairs minister, Kristina Keneally, has said there is \u201cno evidence\u201d the laws are not working but Labor will consider government amendments if necessary. Other opponents of the repeal of medevac include former independent MP Kerryn Phelps, one of the architects of the original bill, and Shaun Hanns, a home affairs departmental official who quit his job in the refugee processing area to argue publicly for an overhaul of Australia\u2019s border protection regime.",

      "bodyText": "Queensland Labor is set to endorse a change to its official platform to become more coal friendly, asserting the party\u2019s support for the mining industry as it seeks to reconnect with regional and blue-collar voters. Delegates are expected to overwhelmingly support a proposal at this weekend\u2019s state conference, to be attended by the federal Labor leader Anthony Albanese, which adds a new chapter to the party\u2019s official platform to emphasise the importance of the mining industry to the state. A draft of the proposal obtained by Guardian Australia commits the ALP to supporting the industry and new mining projects, while lauding rural communities as \u201cthe backbone of our great state\u201d. \u201cLabor supports the Queensland mining industry as a major economic driver in regional communities that has benefits for every Queenslander no matter where they live,\u201d the draft changes state. \u201cLabor will continue to ensure Queensland remains a leading destination for mining and resources investment and export earnings.\u201d The draft also commits the party to providing more incentives for mining companies to train apprentices, in recognition of the \u201cchallenges faced by the mining and resources sector\u201d to source local workers. While the proposed changes will be debated, it is expected that delegates from the industrial left and the right faction will join forces to endorse the new chapter. The move to highlight Labor\u2019s support for the sector in Queensland comes after the party suffered a statewide swing against it of more than 4% in the May federal election, rattling the state government which goes to the polls in October next year. Division over the Adani coalmine and a failure to connect with blue-collar workers in the state, particularly in the mining sector, has been seen as a key reason for the party\u2019s poor showing in the state. The federal MP for the seat of Blair, Shayne Neumann, said the move to alter the party\u2019s platform was recognition that the \u201cpolitical, economic and cultural power\u201d in Queensland was not solely determined by Brisbane. \u201cI welcome a new chapter that has a very strong emphasis on rural, regional and remote Queensland which are all crucial to a decentralised state like Queensland where mining is crucial to economic development and jobs,\u201d he said. While the party has embarked on a review of its loss, several Queensland MPs have attributed the heavy swings in the state to the party\u2019s position on the Adani coalmine. Labor\u2019s shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said there was a perception that Labor was \u201csending mixed messages on the coal industry\u201d and called for the party to refocus on jobs and the economy. The party\u2019s shadow resources minister, Joel Fitzgibbon, has said it was a \u201chuge error\u201d for Labor not to talk about coal because of a fear that it would cost city seats. Three days after the federal election, the Queensland premier, Annastasia Palaszczuk, said the result was a \u201cwake-up call\u201d as she called for the Adani mine to progress swiftly. \u201cI think the federal election was definitely a wake-up call for everyone.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson is a \u201cknown liar\u201d who is copying Vladimir Putin\u2019s approach to the media, according to Channel 4\u2019s head of news and current affairs, who called on broadcasters to aggressively challenge the prime minister\u2019s falsehoods. Dorothy Byrne said Johnson\u2019s shift towards publishing his own videos on Facebook rather than giving sit-down interviews to journalists reminded her of the Russian president, \u201cwho also likes to talk directly to the nation\u201d. She also said television producers should be more willing to directly accuse political leaders of lying. \u201cIf we continue to be so polite, how will our viewers know that politicians are lying?\u201d Byrne asked. The comments are likely to increase tensions between Downing Street and Channel 4, with No 10 already discussing whether it benefits the government to engage with some traditional media outlets. Johnson has declined to be interviewed by the broadcaster in recent months and did not take part in Channel 4\u2019s Conservative leadership debate, with his aides casting doubt on its impartiality. Byrne was speaking during Edinburgh television festival\u2019s annual MacTaggart lecture \u2013 seen as one of the British TV industry\u2019s most important events \u2013 in which she accused prominent television figures of sexual harassment. Byrne also used her speech to call out Johnson\u2019s strategy chief, Dominic Cummings, describing him as \u201cthe UK\u2019s most famous recipient of EU farming subsidies\u201d, while criticising a number of Vote Leave claims about the supposed benefits of Brexit. Byrne said it was time for the television industry to collectively demand politicians give proper interviews, suggesting Johnson was copying the tactics of \u201cMr Chlorinated Chicken himself, Donald Trump\u201d. She said she found the experience of listening to Radio 4\u2019s Today programme to be like \u201caccidentally walking into a knitting shop in Bournemouth\u201d, but leading politicians had a duty to appear on the programme to explain their decisions. \u201cBoris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn are cowards \u2026 If they really believe in the policies they promote, they should come on to television to explain them, to allow them to be scrutinised and to justify them,\u201d Byrne said. Byrne, who described herself as the \u201coldest female TV executive working for a broadcaster\u201d, also highlighted the historically high level of sexual assault in the industry and said the list of individuals who had previously delivered the MacTaggart lecture contained a man \u201cwho has not yet had the comeuppance he deserves for his assaults on women\u201d. In one anecdote, Byrne highlighted how the television industry was still not welcoming to middle-aged women and said there needed to be more awareness of flexible working for people going through the menopause \u2013 citing an incident involving Kevin Lygo, who is now ITV\u2019s director of television. \u201cWe were meeting one day when he suddenly remarked that I looked seriously unwell. I said I was not ill. \u2018But you\u2019ve gone all red and you seem to have a fever,\u2019 he said. I repeated, \u2018I am not ill, Kevin,\u2019 in what I thought was a meaningful way. He repeated that I was and I should go home. So I went back to my desk and announced I was leaving for the day. Everyone asked me why and I said: \u2018Because my boss has never heard of the menopause,\u2019\u201d she said.",

During a friendly press conference on his first overseas visit as PM, which was notable for the absence of any comments from Johnson or <strong>Angela Merkel</strong> critical of each other\u2019s Brexit positions, Merkel at one point appeared to set Johnson a 30 day deadline. She said that the backstop had always been a \u201cfallback position\u201d and would only come into effect if no other solution could be agreed that would protect the \u201cintegrity of the single market\u201d. She went on:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>If one is able to solve this conundrum, if one finds this solution, we said we would probably find it in the next two years to come but we can also maybe find it in the next 30 days to come. Then we are one step further in the right direction and we have to obviously put our all into this.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Her reference to 30 days may just have been an acknowledgment that, if there is going to be a Brexit deal, the elements of it will have to be in place well in time for the next EU summit scheduled in mid-October, which means it would have to be coming together by mid-September anyway. Johnson gratefully accepted this challenge. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>You [Merkel] rightly say the onus is on us to produce those solutions, those ideas, to show how we can address the issue of the Northern Irish border and that is what we want to do. I must say I am very glad listening to you tonight Angela to hear that at least the conversations that matter can now properly begin. You have set a very blistering timetable of 30 days - if I understood you correctly, I am more than happy with that.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>His admission that the \u201conus\u201d was on him to find a solution was significant because until now the UK government has been arguing that it is up to the EU to shift first, by abandoning its stance on the backstop.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson claimed there was \u201cample scope\u201d for a Brexit deal.</strong> Citing <a href=\"https://www.prosperity-uk.com/aacabout/\">the report from the Alternative Arrangements Commission</a>, he said alternatives to the backstop were available. And he criticised Theresa May\u2019s government for not pushing them strongly. He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think what we need to do is remove it whole and entire - the backstop - and then work, as Chancellor Merkel says, on the alternative arrangements. </p> \n   <p>There are abundant solutions which are proffered, which have already been discussed. I don\u2019t think, to be fair, they have so far been very actively proposed over the last three years by the British government. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Explaining what the ideas in the Alternative Arrangements Commission report involve, Johnson said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We do think there are alternative arrangements that could readily be used to address the problem of frictionless trade at the Northern Irish border and you\u2019ll have heard them before, whether it is trusted trader schemes or electronic pre-clearing, all that type of solution and more besides is what we will be wanting to discuss.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>David Henig</strong>, the former civil servant who heads the UK Trade Policy Project, thinks Johnson\u2019s optimism is misplaced.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DavidHenigUK/status/1164222936552738824\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Remember the EU did not think the Alternative Arrangements Commission work was a basis for replacing the backstop.

Angela Merkel has always been one of the EU leaders most solicitous towards the UK in the Brexit process, and this afternoon there was a very stark contrast between her tone and that adopted, for example, by the Irish European commissioner Phil Hogan (see<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/aug/21/brexit-latest-news-boris-johnson-berlin-merkel-prepares-to-visit-berlin-as-minister-struggles-to-defend-his-collaborators-jibe-live-news?page=with:block-5d5d4cee8f081cf11cf1a715#block-5d5d4cee8f081cf11cf1a715\"> 3.21pm)</a> or the unnamed French government official briefing the media (see<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/aug/21/brexit-latest-news-boris-johnson-berlin-merkel-prepares-to-visit-berlin-as-minister-struggles-to-defend-his-collaborators-jibe-live-news?page=with:block-5d5d566b8f081cf11cf1a7b9#block-5d5d566b8f081cf11cf1a7b9\"> 3.45pm)</a>. She did not use any language critical of Johnson at all, and she stressed that she remained open to any solution that might provide a workable alternative to the backstop. At one point she talked about how it might be possible to find a solution within the next 30 days and Johnson - whose entire professional training revolved around quickly spotting a headline buried in Eurobabble - immediately flagged this up to journalists, implying this was his \u201cwin\u201d from the press conference: \u201cMerkel gives UK 30 days to solve Brexit.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Whether this is anything more than cosmetic, though, remains to be seen. It may count for very little. Merkel\u2019s tone was helpful, but on substance she gave nothing away at all. The fundamental problems are just the same as they have always been, there is nothing in the Alternative Arrangements Commission report cited by Johnson that has not already been closely studied by Brussels and rejected as an inadequate alternative to the backstop, and both parties are under pressure to appear reasonable because they do not want to take the blame for the inevitable voter backlash that would follow a no-deal Brexit. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/jan/27/donald-trump-and-theresa-may-hold-joint-white-house-press-conference-politics-live?page=with:block-588baa30e4b0860ce556955e#block-588baa30e4b0860ce556955e\">Theresa May\u2019s first press conference with Donald Trump was deemed a success.</a> But that turned out to be a very poor guide to how their relationship eventually developed.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b3d98e3933030eec0963a7293ea402d539c0b00d\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b3d98e3933030eec0963a7293ea402d539c0b00d/0_23_4510_2706/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson and Angela Merkel at the Chancellery in Berlin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson and Angela Merkel at the Chancellery in Berlin.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Clemens Bilan/EPA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-08-22T07:39:38.324Z\">at 8.39am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d5d74608f08a0805bcc20d8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-21T16:45:19.738Z\">5.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Johnson says he has watched a lot of EU negotiations.</p> \n  <p>What seems impossible at first - irresistible force meets immoveable object - turns out to be possible right at the end.</p> \n  <p>He says the solutions often coming in the final furlong, when the horses change places.</p> \n  <p>In response to a question on Russia, he says he has yet to be convinced that it is right for Russia to rejoin G7.

Hogan said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The UK government needs to take responsibility for its choices before it is too late.

Johnson explained his reason for using the term in <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/826166/20190819_PM_letter_to_His_Excellency_Mr_Donald_Tusk.pdf\">his letter (pdf)</a> to Donald Tusk, the European council president, on Monday. Hogan said this was a \u201cstrange\u201d decision coming from \u201can unelected prime minister\u201d. (Johnson became PM after 92,000 Tory members voted for him in a leadership contest, not after winning a general election.) Hogan went on:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We should recall that the backstop was agreed by a prime minister who was democratically elected.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Hogan said the EU \u201cwill not buckle\u201d in response to pressure from the UK.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>From the EU side, nothing has changed. We will hold the line. We have made detailed contingency plans for every outcome and we will not be found wanting. Contrary to what the UK government may wish, the EU will not buckle.</p> \n   <p>Our response to Prime Minister Johnson\u2019s letter is simple: We share his stated commitment to an orderly Brexit and to upholding the Good Friday agreement. We reiterate that the backstop is a necessary, legally operative solution to prevent the return of a hard border on the island of Ireland and we deeply regret that the new UK government wants to replace a legally operative solution with a commitment to try to find a solution - yet to be found- by the end of the transition period.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He accused Johnson of putting \u201cthe best interests of the Tory Party ahead of the best interests of the UK\u201d.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said, three years after the vote to leave the EU, Brussels still did not know what kind of Brexit Britain wanted.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>More than three years on from the referendum, we still have no clear idea about what kind of Brexit the UK wants.

What could possibly go wrong? Well, Basil Fawlty-style, he could start banging on about the second world war. It would not be entirely out of character. During the EU referendum campaign three years ago Johnson provoked criticism by saying that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/16/tories-divided-by-boris-johnsons-eu-hitler-comparison\">the EU had the same goal as Hitler in wanting to create an European superstate</a>, and only last month <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jul/03/tory-leadership-latest-news-boris-johnson-pmqs-accuses-of-dog-whistle-politics-over-plan-to-curb-sin-taxes-live-news?page=with:block-5d1c9c4c8f088a7392738097#block-5d1c9c4c8f088a7392738097\">one of Johnson\u2019s Tory Brexiter allies was complaining in the Commons about Germany being too powerful.</a></p> \n  <p>In reality, it is hard to imagine Johnson being quite that crass. But the war still has a powerful grip on the British public imagination (it is hard to understand the Brexit vote without reference to the second world war\u2019s place in the national story) and this surfaced again only last week when Johnson claimed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/14/johnson-hits-out-at-terrible-collaboration-of-mps-and-eu-trying-to-block-brexit\">there was \u201ca terrible collaboration going on between people who think they can block Brexit in parliament and our European friends\u201d.</a> Readers from abroad may struggle to understand what the fuss was about, but in the UK, particularly for anyone over the age of 50, it is impossible to hear the word \u201ccollaborator\u201d without associating it with supporting the Nazis.</p> \n  <p>That explains why <strong>Robert Jenrick</strong>, the housing secretary, had problems this morning when John Humprhys asked him on the Today programme if he supported Johnson\u2019s use of the word last week. At first Jenrick tried to reframe the question, saying:<br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The point that the prime minister was making, which I 100% agree with ...</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Humphrys tried again. Did Jenrick agree with the use of the word collaboration? Jenrick replied:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I agree with the prime minister ... It is not in the national interest, at this moment in time, to undermine the prime minister\u2019s hand as we enter this period of negotiations.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Humphrys asked a third time if Jenrick viewed Tory MPs opposed to a no-deal Brexit as collaborators. Jenrick replied:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>What I\u2019m saying is that all members of parliament, particularly Conservatives, need to support the prime minister to help us in these final preparations ...</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Humphrys pointed out that Jenrick was continuing to avoid the question. For a fourth time, he asked if Jenrick was supporting the PM. Jenrick replied:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I\u2019m explaining the prime minister\u2019s words, which I 100% support. I\u2019ve always believed that you have to give the prime minister the strongest hand, he can have in these negotiations. And that means ensuring that we leave on 31 October. That is the only route to a real renegotiation in the weeks ahead.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>So Jenrick claimed that he 100% supported Johnson\u2019s language \u2013 even though he obviously didn\u2019t, because he was not willing to use the word collaborator. </p> \n  <p>What Jenrick did do, though, was repeat the claim made by Johnson yesterday that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/aug/20/brexit-latest-news-boris-johnsons-backstop-offer-to-eu-dismissed-by-labour-as-fantasyland-wish-list-live-news?page=with:block-5d5c22c48f081cf11cf19f5b#block-5d5c22c48f081cf11cf19f5b\">Tory MPs opposed to a no-deal Brexit were undermining the PM\u2019s renegotiation.</a></p> \n  <p>Johnson is due in Berlin at about 5pm UK time.

      "bodyText": "Here are the main points from the press conference. Boris Johnson accepted that he had 30 days to persuade the EU that there was a viable alternative to the backstop. For the first time, he seemed to accept that it was up to the UK to come up with a solution, not the EU. During a friendly press conference on his first overseas visit as PM, which was notable for the absence of any comments from Johnson or Angela Merkel critical of each other\u2019s Brexit positions, Merkel at one point appeared to set Johnson a 30 day deadline. She said that the backstop had always been a \u201cfallback position\u201d and would only come into effect if no other solution could be agreed that would protect the \u201cintegrity of the single market\u201d. She went on: If one is able to solve this conundrum, if one finds this solution, we said we would probably find it in the next two years to come but we can also maybe find it in the next 30 days to come. Then we are one step further in the right direction and we have to obviously put our all into this. Her reference to 30 days may just have been an acknowledgment that, if there is going to be a Brexit deal, the elements of it will have to be in place well in time for the next EU summit scheduled in mid-October, which means it would have to be coming together by mid-September anyway. Johnson gratefully accepted this challenge. He said: You [Merkel] rightly say the onus is on us to produce those solutions, those ideas, to show how we can address the issue of the Northern Irish border and that is what we want to do. I must say I am very glad listening to you tonight Angela to hear that at least the conversations that matter can now properly begin. You have set a very blistering timetable of 30 days - if I understood you correctly, I am more than happy with that. His admission that the \u201conus\u201d was on him to find a solution was significant because until now the UK government has been arguing that it is up to the EU to shift first, by abandoning its stance on the backstop. Johnson claimed there was \u201cample scope\u201d for a Brexit deal. Citing the report from the Alternative Arrangements Commission, he said alternatives to the backstop were available. And he criticised Theresa May\u2019s government for not pushing them strongly. He said: I think what we need to do is remove it whole and entire - the backstop - and then work, as Chancellor Merkel says, on the alternative arrangements. There are abundant solutions which are proffered, which have already been discussed. I don\u2019t think, to be fair, they have so far been very actively proposed over the last three years by the British government. Explaining what the ideas in the Alternative Arrangements Commission report involve, Johnson said: We do think there are alternative arrangements that could readily be used to address the problem of frictionless trade at the Northern Irish border and you\u2019ll have heard them before, whether it is trusted trader schemes or electronic pre-clearing, all that type of solution and more besides is what we will be wanting to discuss. David Henig, the former civil servant who heads the UK Trade Policy Project, thinks Johnson\u2019s optimism is misplaced. Johnson claimed EU negotiations often resulted in a surprise agreement at the last minute. He said: I have, in my life, watched a lot of European negotiations and, believe me, it looks at first as though it is, you know, irresistible force and immovable object. What in my experience happens is that people find a way through and I think that if we approach this with sufficient patience and optimism, as I say, we can get this done and it is in the final furlong generally when the horses change places and the winning deal appears. Henig thinks Johnson is wrong about this too. Johnson and Merkel agreed that it would not be right to readmit Russia to the G7 now. Asked about this, Johnson said: I am aware of the moves to reintegrate Russia into the G7 ... I just have to say that given what happened in Salisbury in Wiltshire, given the use of chemical weapons on British soil, given the continuing instability, civil war, the war in Ukraine, given Russia\u2019s provocations, not just in Ukraine but in many other places, I must say I am very much with Chancellor Merkel in thinking that the case has yet to be made out for Russia to return to the G7. And Merkel said: As the situation is today I would say there is not yet sufficient progress for saying the reasons we had in 2014 [for excluding Russia] are obsolete. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Here is Jeremy Cliffe, the Economist\u2019s Brussels bureau chief, and former Berlin correspondent, on the Merkel/Johnson press conference. From my colleague Owen Gibson Here is the \u201c30 days\u201d quote from Angela Merkel. If one is able to solve this conundrum, if one finds this solution, we said we would probably find it in the next two years to come but we can also maybe find it in the next 30 days to come. Then we are one step further in the right direction and we have to obviously put our all into this. A reader has been in touch to explain the German phrase that Boris Johnson used during the press conference that seemed to cause Angela Merkel some amusement. (See 5.30pm.) And this is what other journalists and commentators are saying about the press conference. From the BBC\u2019s Adam Fleming From the BBC\u2019s Nick Eardley From the Eurasia consultancy\u2019s Mujtaba Rahman From Sky\u2019s Rob Powell From the Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn From the BBC\u2019s Jenny Hill From the Telegraph\u2019s Christopher Hope I will post a summary of the main quotes from the press conference shortly. Boris Johnson will be pleased with that. Angela Merkel has always been one of the EU leaders most solicitous towards the UK in the Brexit process, and this afternoon there was a very stark contrast between her tone and that adopted, for example, by the Irish European commissioner Phil Hogan (see 3.21pm) or the unnamed French government official briefing the media (see 3.45pm). She did not use any language critical of Johnson at all, and she stressed that she remained open to any solution that might provide a workable alternative to the backstop. At one point she talked about how it might be possible to find a solution within the next 30 days and Johnson - whose entire professional training revolved around quickly spotting a headline buried in Eurobabble - immediately flagged this up to journalists, implying this was his \u201cwin\u201d from the press conference: \u201cMerkel gives UK 30 days to solve Brexit.\u201d Whether this is anything more than cosmetic, though, remains to be seen. It may count for very little. Merkel\u2019s tone was helpful, but on substance she gave nothing away at all. The fundamental problems are just the same as they have always been, there is nothing in the Alternative Arrangements Commission report cited by Johnson that has not already been closely studied by Brussels and rejected as an inadequate alternative to the backstop, and both parties are under pressure to appear reasonable because they do not want to take the blame for the inevitable voter backlash that would follow a no-deal Brexit. Theresa May\u2019s first press conference with Donald Trump was deemed a success. But that turned out to be a very poor guide to how their relationship eventually developed. Johnson says he has watched a lot of EU negotiations. What seems impossible at first - irresistible force meets immoveable object - turns out to be possible right at the end. He says the solutions often coming in the final furlong, when the horses change places. In response to a question on Russia, he says he has yet to be convinced that it is right for Russia to rejoin G7. He says this is one area where the UK and Germany agree. And that\u2019s it. Merkel says they have to get off to work. Q: Doesn\u2019t the basis problem remain - the EU will not change its position, and the UK won\u2019t either? Merkel says that question cannot be answered today. She says she sees \u201cpossibilities\u201d through changes to the political declaration. Merkel suggests changing the political declaration on the future UK-EU relationship could provide a solution to the backstop problem. Johnson says he will be discussing alternatives to the backstop with Merkel. He refers to the \u201cexcellent\u201d Alternative Arrangements Commission report which sets some of these out. Johnson says under no circumstances will the UK impose checks at the border in Ireland. The government thinks it can manage the border without checks, he says. He says he is not attracted to having a time limit on the backstop. There are other flaws with it, he says. Johnson says even with a time limit, the backstop would still be unacceptable. He says the alternatives to the backstop have not been actively proposed over the last three years by the British government. Johnson suggests May did not do enough to push alternatives to the backstop. Merkel says the commission is negotiation on behalf of the EU 27. The EU 27 want to have a uniform, consistent position, she says. She says the UK also needs to say what its ideas are. She says it is not her job as German chancellor to understand all the issues relating to the Northern Ireland/Ireland border. So it is up to the UK to suggest ideas, she says. She says she wants to protect the integrity of the single market. Q: [To Merkel] Why won\u2019t you change the backstop when it won\u2019t get through parliament? Merkel says she follows the debate in the UK. She knows the problem. But the backstop is there to solve a problem, she says. She suggests that if another solution to the border problem could be found, she would be amenable. But she suggests it would have to be workable. They have a lot to discuss tonight, she says. Q: [To Johnson] The EU says it will not renegotiate the withdrawal agreement. So will you compromise -or is this trip just posturing before you blame the EU? Johnson says he thinks there is \u201cample scope\u201d to do a deal. Johnson says there is \u201cample scope\u201d to do a Brexit deal. He says the backstop \u201cplainly has to go\u201d. But if we can get rid of it, we can make progress very quickly indeed, he says. Boris Johnson says thank you for that \u201camazing welcome\u201d he received. He has not had one like that in his life, he says. (He has never been abroad as prime minister, so that is not particularly surprising.) Johnson says Germany and the UK are \u201cshoulder to shoulder\u201d. They work together in Nato, in tackling climate change, and in addressing the threats to the natural worl. This evening they will discuss Russia, China, Iran, Hong Kong - and many other subjects. And of course they are \u201cfated\u201d to discuss Brexit, he says. He says he wants to stress that he believes he can get a deal. He uses a German word to make his point, which Merkel seems to find amusing. But the UK cannot be trapped in the legal order of the EU without having any say in it, he says. That is why the backstop must be removed. He says he is absolutely committed to the protection of the 3m EU nationals in the UK. Back in the press conference Merkel says she and Johnson will be talking about foreign policy as well as about Brexit. From my colleague Kate Connelly in Berlin Angela Merkel and Boris Johnson are holding their press conference. Merkel says they have a lot on their plate to discuss. She says she hopes and prays relations with the UK will continue to be friendly after Brexit. From the Germany point of view, a negotiated Brexit would be welcome. But Germany is also prepared for a no deal, she says. Jeremy Corbyn has written to the leaders of other opposition parties, and to some backbenchers, inviting them to a meeting in his office next week to discuss what can be done to stop a no-deal Brexit. According to Labour, his letter says: Further to our correspondence last week, I would like to invite you to a meeting to discuss all tactics available to prevent no deal. The country is heading into a constitutional and political storm, so it is vital that we meet urgently, before parliament returns. The chaos and dislocation of Boris Johnson\u2019s No Deal Brexit is real and threatening, as the government\u2019s leaked Operation Yellowhammer dossier makes crystal clear. That\u2019s why we must do everything we can to stop it. I hope you are able to attend the meeting, which we will hold in my office on Tuesday 27th August at 12pm. Please confirm your attendance by email. Yours sincerely, Jeremy Corbyn The letter has gone to the following party or party group leaders at Westminster: Ian Blackford (SNP); Jo Swinson (Lib Dems); Liz Saville Roberts (Plaid Cymru); and Anna Soubry (the Independent Group for Change). It has also gone to the Green MP Caroline Lucas, the Tories Guto Bebb, Dominic Grieve and Oliver Letwin, and to the former Tory-turned-independent Nick Boles. Turning away from Berlin for a moment, the BBC\u2019s Faisal Islam says that, when he was in Holyhead earlier, Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, said that the new government was revising the tariff schedule for a no-deal Brexit published earlier this year when Theresa May was PM. The Operation Yellowhammer report leaked at the weekend said that the plan to have zero tariffs on oil imports in the event of a no-deal Brexit would lead to the closure of two refineries in the UK, because they would no longer be able to compete. Boris Johnson and Angela Merkel will be holding a short press conference soon. According to Sky\u2019s Sam Coates, who is in Berlin, there were a few people protesting as Boris Johnson arrived. Boris Johnson has arrived. Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, has now arrived for the welcome ceremony. There is a live feed at the top of this blog. Here are some pictures from Berlin, where the Germans are getting ready to welcome Boris Johnson who is due to arrive at the Chancellery quite soon. France believes a no deal exit is now the \u201cmost likely\u201d Brexit scenario after Johnson demanded the EU reopen the withdrawal agreement and drop the Irish backstop. A French official said: If the UK considers that having a backstop is absolutely excluded, that is its right, but in that case it limits the possibility of reaching an agreement. The official added: The idea of saying \u2018there\u2019s not a deal, so I won\u2019t pay\u2019 does not work. We cannot imagine that a country like the UK would back out of an international commitment. From Bloomberg\u2019s Jess Shankleman This is from Jenny Hill, the BBC\u2019s Berlin correspondent. Reuters has some more news alerts from the French government briefing also attended by Bloomberg. (See 3.26pm.) They\u2019re capped up, because that\u2019s how Reuters sends them out on the news wires. EU POSITION ON BREXIT WON\u2019T CHANGE EVEN IN CASE OF PRESSURE FROM TRUMP - FRENCH OFFICIAL EVEN IN CASE OF NO-DEAL, EU WILL CONSIDER BREXIT BILL TO BE DUE - FRENCH OFFICIAL EU WOULD PROBABLY ACCEPT TO GRANT BRITAIN A DELAY ON BREXIT TO HOLD NEW ELECTIONS - FRENCH OFFICIAL BRITAIN SHOULD HAVE NO DOUBT FRANCE, GERMANY AND OTHER EU COUNTRIES ARE TOTALLY UNITED - FRENCH OFFICIAL Boris Johnson is meeting Emmanuel Macron, the French president, tomorrow, and this briefing will ratchet up the tension in advance. The point about the Brexit bill is particularly important. Johnson has repeatedly said that, in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the government will have an extra \u00a339bn (the Brexit bill payable to the EU) available - even though his own attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, has said that this is not true. The French government is now working on the assumption that a no-deal Brexit is the most likely outcome, Bloomberg is reporting. Phil Hogan, the European commissioner for agriculture and an Irish politician from Leo Varadkar\u2019s Fine Gael party, has launched what the Irish Independent (rightly) describes as a \u201cscathing attack\u201d on Boris Johnson. He was speaking this morning at an event in Carlingford in Ireland. Hogan\u2019s own account of his message on Twitter is bland and unexceptional. But the Irish Independent\u2019s Hugh O\u2019Connell has filed a report based on a text of what Hogan was planning to say, and the quotes are very strong. Here are the main points. Hogan said that a no-deal Brexit would create a \u201cfoul atmosphere\u201d between the UK and the EU. He said: If the UK fails to prevent a crash-out Brexit they should be under no illusion regarding the foul atmosphere they will create with their EU partners and the serious consequences this will have for negotiating any future trade agreement. He accused Johnson of \u201cgambling with peace\u201d in relation to Northern Ireland. He cited Churchill - one of Johnson\u2019s hero - to explain why a no-deal Brexit would be do damaging. Hogan said: The UK government needs to take responsibility for its choices before it is too late. Prime Minister Johnson\u2019s hero is Winston Churchill and he seems to view himself as a modern day Churchill. However, in the event of a no deal Brexit, the UK government\u2019s only Churchilian legacy will be \u2013\u2018never have so few done so much damage to so many\u2019. Hogan dismissed Johnson as an \u201cunelected prime minister\u201d. EU leaders have been angered by Johnson\u2019s decision to describe the backstop as \u201cundemocratic\u201d, despite the fact that it was agreed by EU leaders and Theresa May, implementing a commitment made by the UK government in the joint report of December 2017 when Johnson was foreign secretary. Johnson explained his reason for using the term in his letter (pdf) to Donald Tusk, the European council president, on Monday. Hogan said this was a \u201cstrange\u201d decision coming from \u201can unelected prime minister\u201d. (Johnson became PM after 92,000 Tory members voted for him in a leadership contest, not after winning a general election.) Hogan went on: We should recall that the backstop was agreed by a prime minister who was democratically elected. Hogan said the EU \u201cwill not buckle\u201d in response to pressure from the UK. He said: From the EU side, nothing has changed. We will hold the line. We have made detailed contingency plans for every outcome and we will not be found wanting. Contrary to what the UK government may wish, the EU will not buckle. Our response to Prime Minister Johnson\u2019s letter is simple: We share his stated commitment to an orderly Brexit and to upholding the Good Friday agreement. We reiterate that the backstop is a necessary, legally operative solution to prevent the return of a hard border on the island of Ireland and we deeply regret that the new UK government wants to replace a legally operative solution with a commitment to try to find a solution - yet to be found- by the end of the transition period. He accused Johnson of putting \u201cthe best interests of the Tory Party ahead of the best interests of the UK\u201d. He said, three years after the vote to leave the EU, Brussels still did not know what kind of Brexit Britain wanted. He said: More than three years on from the referendum, we still have no clear idea about what kind of Brexit the UK wants. And the UK is running out of time to make up its mind. This is from my colleague Jennifer Rankin in Brussels. Speaking during his visit to the port of Holyhead Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister in charge of no-deal Brexit planning, was also asked what he thought the chances of no deal were. He replied: Different people put a different statistical likelihood on it. My view is that there is a chance that it might happen therefore we need to be ready for it and many of the things that we would do anyway as we leave the single market and the customs union we would do or need to do in the event of leaving without a deal. He also stressed that \u201cgoodwill on all sides\u201d would be required for the \u201calternative arrangements\u201d favoured by the government as a replacement for the backstop in Northern Ireland to work. He explained: There are a series of particular facilitations and easements that can be introduced alongside technology which can help ensure that we have as effective a flow of goods over the Northern Ireland and Republic of Ireland border as businesses will need. It all depends on the willingness of the EU, in particular the European commission, to commit to making sure that some of the work that\u2019s already being done is expedited. Asked if it would be possible for that work to be done before October 31, Gove replied: If the EU commit to this approach then it\u2019s perfectly possible for us to have a transition or implementation period and then to work on all the steps that are required in order to give confidence that we can continue to have a solution of the island of Ireland that works in everyone\u2019s interest. As the anti-Brexit campaign group, Led By Donkeys, has been pointing out this month, Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister in charge of no-deal Brexit planning, has in the past admitted that no deal would be undesirable. Today, on a visit to Holyhead in Wales, where he was inspecting Brexit planning at the port, he stressed that he still wanted a deal with the EU. Asked about his previous comments about a no-deal Brexit, he told the BBC: Well, we have to leave. We voted to leave ... I\u2019ve made it clear throughout that we have to honour the vote. Politicians don\u2019t get to choose the votes that they honour. People voted to leave. It is better to leave with a deal. That is the government\u2019s policy. But if the choice is no Brexit or Brexit and no deal, then I would choose Brexit and no deal, and I\u2019ve always been clear on that point. EU net migration to the UK is higher than previously thought, the Office for National Statistics has admitted, prompting experts to claim that the numbers have been \u201csystematically\u201d under-estimated. As the Press Association reports, the ONS said it under-estimated levels of EU migration to the UK, affecting figures on the number of migrants from EU8 countries - like Poland - since 2016. Migration from countries outside the EU has been over-stated, the ONS added. In an announcement it said: In the year ending March 2016 - the latest point at which we have adjusted data available - EU net migration is around 16% higher than our published estimate. In the year ending March 2016, net migration is around 13% lower than our published estimate. As a result the ONS has downgraded the status of its quarterly immigration figures it compiles to \u201cexperimental\u201d, the Press Association reports. Boris Johnson has been making a series of election-style announcements since he became prime minister, and Number 10 must have been hoping to see Conservative poll ratings lift as a result. The evidence suggests he is having some effect. In a post on his UK Polling Report blog yesterday Anthony Wells listed the five August polls then available, all giving the Tories a lead over Labour varying from three points to nine points. \u201cWe\u2019re now at a point where the most recent polls from all the regular polling companies show the Conservatives back ahead,\u201d Wells wrote. Since then there have been two more polls giving the Tories a big lead. Last night YouGov released a second August poll, putting the Conservatives on 30% and Labour on 21%. And today Kantar has released a poll suggesting the Tories are 14 points ahead. It puts them on 42%, with Labour on 28%, the Lib Dems on 15% and the Brexit party on 5%. Jo Swinson, the new Lib Dem leader, has appointed what she describes as a shadow cabinet (which is not to be confused with the shadow cabinet, the one appointed by Jeremy Corbyn). Sir Ed Davey, her rival for the leadership, will speak for the party on Treasury and business matters. Chuka Umunna, the former Labour MP who had been holding the Treasury brief, will speak for the party on foreign affairs, international development and international trade. And Christine Jardine will speak for the party will speak for the party on home affairs, justice and equalities. Sir Vince Cable, the former leader, will speak for the party on health and social care. The full list of appointments is here. The EU27 are united over Brexit, the European commission said today. At its regular daily briefing, commenting on Boris Johnson\u2019s meetings with Angela Merkel this evening and Emmanuel Macron tomorrow, the commission spokeswoman, Natasha Bertaud, said: It\u2019s normal that our member states meet and talk to one another. Beyond this, the EU27 have had from the outset - and continue to have now - one single, united position on Brexit matters. A major critic of the HS2 scheme has been appointed deputy chair of the government review of its viability launched today, my colleague Gwyn Topham reports. Lord Berkeley, a railway expert and Labour peer, has repeatedly challenged the Department for Transport\u2019s cost figures and warned that the budgets were spiralling out of control. Here is Gwyn\u2019s story. Number 10 is knocking down the Sun story claiming Boris Johnson would like Ireland to temporarily derogate from the EU single market (see 10.17am), according to the Brexit specialist Mujtaba Rahman from the Eurasia consultancy. A former German ambassador to the UK, Thomas Matussek, told the Today programme this morning, that British ministers could be \u201cin for a nasty surprise\u201d if they think the EU will make Brexit concessions at the last minute. Asked about the possibility of the EU backing down, he said: Well I think this time it might be wrong [to assume the EU will shift at the last minute] because I think it\u2019s important, if you try to put yourself into the shoes of your partner, and the clear assessment of the interests of both sides indicate that there are certain issues on which the EU cannot budge and these are the four freedoms. So I think they might be in for a nasty surprise. The EU was committed to the backstop, he explained. We cannot throw Ireland under the bus. What message would that send to other members of the EU family if we gave up that sort of loyalty and solidarity? Gerald Vernon-Jackson, the leader of Portsmouth council, has called the government\u2019s \u00a39m no-deal funding pledge to councils \u201ctoo little, too late\u201d and said his own council alone had spent \u00a34m preparing the port for potentially thousands more lorries attempting to exit, my colleague Jessica Elgot reports. Simon Coveney, Ireland\u2019s deputy prime minister and minister for foreign affairs, told RTE\u2019s Radio One this morning that a no-deal Brexit was becoming \u201cfar more likely\u201d. He explained: There is a consequence to the approach that the British government is taking and that consequence is that they are making a no-deal far more likely. There is a reason why Boris Johnson is visiting Berlin today and Paris tomorrow, to try to talk to EU leaders about finding a way forward. I think he will get a very consistent message from EU leaders that the negotiations over the last two to three years are not going to be abandoned now. We will try and find a way to give the reassurance and clarification that Boris Johnson needs to sell a deal. We will try and be imaginative about that and be helpful on that. Coveney also insisted that Ireland would not abandon the backstop just on the basis of a \u201cpromise\u201d from Boris Johnson that the UK and the EU might find an alternative means of avoiding a hard border in the future. He said: We are not going to abandon a solution that we know works for some kind of promise on the basis of trust that we will all work together to try and find a solution and muddle on in the future to solve the border. If we do that, what we will be doing is we will creating collateral damage in Ireland to solve a problem in Westminster and for the next number of years, the border issue will dominate Irish politics, north and south because we haven\u2019t resolved it in the way we that know we can. We are not in the business of facilitating the UK effectively moving away from commitments they have made to Ireland and the EU to protect the Good Friday agreement, to protect an all-island economy, and to replace that with some sort of make-shift deal in the weeks before a no-deal, that isn\u2019t what we are going to do. During the Tory leadership contest Boris Johnson said he wanted to review the case for HS2. That review is now going ahead. Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, has announced it in a statement this morning. The review will be conducted by the former HS2 Ltd chairman Douglas Oakervee and it will the consider \u201cwhether and how HS2 should proceed\u201d. The full terms of reference are here (pdf). Shapps said: The prime minister has been clear that transport infrastructure has the potential to drive economic growth, redistribute opportunity and support towns and cities across the UK, but that investments must be subject to continuous assessment of their costs and benefits. That\u2019s why we are undertaking this independent and rigorous review of HS2. Douglas Oakervee and his expert panel will consider all the evidence available, and provide the department with clear advice on the future of the project. The terms of reference make it clear that cancelling the whole project would be an option. During the leadership contest there were claims that, in his private meetings with Tory MPs, Johnson was giving some of them the impression that he wanted to continue with HS2, while leaving others with the impression that he wanted to scrap the project. On the subject of the backstop, Jon Sopel, the BBC\u2019s North America editor, has an imaginative solution. Sopel is, of course, joking. But, according to the Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn, Boris Johnson is considering a plan almost as improbable. Newton Dunn says the PM believes the backstop problem could be solved not by Northern Ireland remaining in the EU single market, but by Ireland leaving it (temporarily). Perhaps this is a joke too, but these days it is getting hard to tell ... Norbert R\u00f6ttgen, chair of the German parliament\u2019s foreign affairs committee and an Angela Merkel ally, has used Twitter this morning to restate his view (reported in our overnight story) that Boris Johnson would have been better off not writing the letter to Donald Tusk released on Monday. Robert Jenrick, a former Treasury minister, was promoted to the cabinet as housing secretary after supporting Boris Johnson enthusiastically in the Tory leadership contest. But his performance on the Today programme this morning is getting some harsh reviews on Twitter. From the former Sun editor David Yelland From the Times columnist David Aaronovitich From the Labour MP Barry Sheerman From the former Labour Europe minister Denis MacShane Boris Johnson is making his first visit abroad as prime minister today when he visits Berlin for dinner with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel. What could possibly go wrong? Well, Basil Fawlty-style, he could start banging on about the second world war. It would not be entirely out of character. During the EU referendum campaign three years ago Johnson provoked criticism by saying that the EU had the same goal as Hitler in wanting to create an European superstate, and only last month one of Johnson\u2019s Tory Brexiter allies was complaining in the Commons about Germany being too powerful. In reality, it is hard to imagine Johnson being quite that crass. But the war still has a powerful grip on the British public imagination (it is hard to understand the Brexit vote without reference to the second world war\u2019s place in the national story) and this surfaced again only last week when Johnson claimed there was \u201ca terrible collaboration going on between people who think they can block Brexit in parliament and our European friends\u201d. Readers from abroad may struggle to understand what the fuss was about, but in the UK, particularly for anyone over the age of 50, it is impossible to hear the word \u201ccollaborator\u201d without associating it with supporting the Nazis. That explains why Robert Jenrick, the housing secretary, had problems this morning when John Humprhys asked him on the Today programme if he supported Johnson\u2019s use of the word last week. At first Jenrick tried to reframe the question, saying: The point that the prime minister was making, which I 100% agree with ... Humphrys tried again. Did Jenrick agree with the use of the word collaboration? Jenrick replied: I agree with the prime minister ... It is not in the national interest, at this moment in time, to undermine the prime minister\u2019s hand as we enter this period of negotiations. Humphrys asked a third time if Jenrick viewed Tory MPs opposed to a no-deal Brexit as collaborators. Jenrick replied: What I\u2019m saying is that all members of parliament, particularly Conservatives, need to support the prime minister to help us in these final preparations ... Humphrys pointed out that Jenrick was continuing to avoid the question. For a fourth time, he asked if Jenrick was supporting the PM. Jenrick replied: I\u2019m explaining the prime minister\u2019s words, which I 100% support. I\u2019ve always believed that you have to give the prime minister the strongest hand, he can have in these negotiations. And that means ensuring that we leave on 31 October. That is the only route to a real renegotiation in the weeks ahead. So Jenrick claimed that he 100% supported Johnson\u2019s language \u2013 even though he obviously didn\u2019t, because he was not willing to use the word collaborator. What Jenrick did do, though, was repeat the claim made by Johnson yesterday that Tory MPs opposed to a no-deal Brexit were undermining the PM\u2019s renegotiation. Johnson is due in Berlin at about 5pm UK time. Here is my colleague Philip Oltermann\u2019s preview story. There is not a lot else in the diary today, although Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, is visiting Holyhead port to review preparations for a no-deal Brexit. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to publish a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

The CBO previously predicted a $896bn deficit for 2019 and a dip to $892bn for 2020. Trump came to power criticizing the US\u2019s huge debts and promising to pay them off. Instead he has contributed to rising debts by signing a $1.5tn tax cut bill and spending packages that have not been accompanied by spending cuts. The escalating debt load is being driven by sluggish economic growth as well as spending and tax cuts. US GDP is expected to reach 2.6% this year and fall to 2.1% in 2020, according to the CBO. As the economic expansion slows Trump has said he is exploring a series of tax cuts to stimulate growth that will further deepen debts. Deficits usually shrink in times of high employment and the US is experiencing the longest growth in job creation since records began. Government debt as a share of the economy is expected to rise from 79% this year to 95% in 2029. On the campaign trail Trump was a persistent critic of government spending. In 2016 he said he would eliminate the national debt \u201cover a period of eight years\u201d. In July Congress reached a deal to increase federal spending and raise the government\u2019s borrowing limit in a move that pushed the next budget discussion into 2020, after the next election. Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said: \u201cThe recent budget deal was a budget buster, and now we have further proof. Both parties took an already unsustainable situation and made it much worse. Debt is now going to grow to almost the size of the economy within the decade. If Congress keeps extending tax cuts, debt will likely exceed the size of the economy within the decade.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A prominent professor at the MIT Media Lab has announced he is resigning from the prestigious research centre in protest after it was revealed its director took money from the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein. Ethan Zuckerman, who is the director of the Center for Civic Media at the laboratory in Cambridge, Massachusetts, told his employers he was leaving after discovering the institution\u2019s links to Epstein, who committed suicide in jail earlier this month after being arrested on federal sex trafficking and conspiracy charges, according to the Boston Globe. \u201cI\u2019m working with my students and staff to move my work out of the Media Lab. That might involve moving to another part of MIT. It might mean moving elsewhere,\u201d he told the newspaper. The lab\u2019s director, Joi Ito, said in a statement earlier this month that he first met Epstein at a conference in 2013 \u2013 five years after the wealthy investor pleaded guilty and was imprisoned for a year for soliciting a minor for prostitution. He admitted to inviting Epstein to the lab, visiting \u201cseveral\u201d of his residences, accepting money from his foundations and permitting him to invest in his tech startup funds. Zuckerman, who played a key role in the lab\u2019s annual disobedience award, which last year recognised the #MeToo movement, reportedly wrote in a note to past winners that he was \u201cheartbroken\u201d. He told Ito he planned to move out of the lab by the end of the academic year in May 2020. \u201cThe work my group does focuses on social justice and on the inclusion of marginalized individuals and points of view,\u201d Zuckerman wrote on Medium. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to do that work with a straight face in a place that violated its own values so clearly in working with Epstein and in disguising that relationship.\u201d As well as high-profile friends that included royalty, presidents and Hollywood stars, Epstein also cultivated a network of top scientists. Referring to himself as a \u201cscience philanthropist\u201d, he reportedly donated as much as $20m a year to scientists and their work. Citing publicly available documents, the Boston Globe reports that Epstein\u2019s foundation and not-for-profit gave MIT at least $200,000. In a public apology, published on the lab\u2019s website, Ito wrote: \u201cI want you to know that in all of my interactions with Epstein, I was never involved in, never heard him talk about and never saw any evidence of the horrific acts that he was accused of. \u201cThat said, I take full responsibility for my error in judgment.

The change will also apply to Sevens World Cup tournaments.</p> <p>The World Rugby chairman, Bill Beaumont, said: \u201cThis announcement demonstrates our ongoing and unwavering commitment to advancing women in rugby both on and off the field in line with our ambitious strategic plan. Unintentional gender bias in sport is an ongoing issue. As a global sporting federation we need to be leading from the front on the issue of equality. By adopting gender balance in the naming of men\u2019s and women\u2019s Rugby World Cup competitions, we are setting new standards in equality in rugby.\u201d</p> <p>This year the France men\u2019s national team was renamed \u201cXV de France Masculin\u201d in a similar bid for gender equality. In England, the Premiership champions, Saracens, refer to themselves as Saracens Men while Harlequins Ladies recently changed their name to Harlequins Women.</p> <p>Serge Simon, chair of World Rugby\u2019s women\u2019s advisory committee, said: \u201cThis is much more than an initiative \u2013 it is the ultimate statement of equality and a first for sport. I am excited about this landmark decision but this is the beginning of the journey. Together, we are working hard to do something very special for women, for the game.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "World Rugby has rebranded its men\u2019s and women\u2019s World Cups in an effort to achieve gender neutrality in the sport. The competitions will now be referred to simply as Rugby World Cups with gender no longer included in their titles in a move that World Rugby has heralded as \u201cthe ultimate statement in equality\u201d. For the women\u2019s edition of the tournament the change will come in for the 2021 World Cup in New Zealand. The most recent was hosted by Ireland in 2017 when the final, when New Zealand beat England, was broadcast on free-to-air TV for the first time and attracted a peak audience of 2.6 million. The decision to drop genders from competition titles is a first for a major sporting federation and World Rugby believes it will \u201celevate the profile of the women\u2019s game, while eliminating any inherent or perceived bias towards men\u2019s only competitions and tournaments\u201d. The change will also apply to Sevens World Cup tournaments. The World Rugby chairman, Bill Beaumont, said: \u201cThis announcement demonstrates our ongoing and unwavering commitment to advancing women in rugby both on and off the field in line with our ambitious strategic plan. Unintentional gender bias in sport is an ongoing issue. As a global sporting federation we need to be leading from the front on the issue of equality. By adopting gender balance in the naming of men\u2019s and women\u2019s Rugby World Cup competitions, we are setting new standards in equality in rugby.\u201d This year the France men\u2019s national team was renamed \u201cXV de France Masculin\u201d in a similar bid for gender equality. In England, the Premiership champions, Saracens, refer to themselves as Saracens Men while Harlequins Ladies recently changed their name to Harlequins Women. Serge Simon, chair of World Rugby\u2019s women\u2019s advisory committee, said: \u201cThis is much more than an initiative \u2013 it is the ultimate statement of equality and a first for sport. I am excited about this landmark decision but this is the beginning of the journey. Together, we are working hard to do something very special for women, for the game.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, has accused environmental groups of setting fires in the Amazon as he tries to deflect growing international criticism of his failure to protect the world\u2019s biggest rainforest. A surge of fires in several Amazonian states this month followed reports that farmers were feeling emboldened to clear land for crop fields and cattle ranches because the new Brazilian government was keen to open up the region to economic activity. Brazil has had more than 72,000 fire outbreaks so far this year, an 84% increase on the same period in 2018, according to the country\u2019s National Institute for Space Research. More than half of them were in the Amazon. There was a sharp spike in deforestation during July, which has been followed by extensive burning in August. Local newspapers say farmers in some regions are organising \u201cfire days\u201d to take advantage of weaker enforcement by the authorities. Since Bolsonaro took power the environment agency has issued fewer penalties, and ministers have made clear that their sympathies are with loggers rather than the indigenous groups who live in the forest. The head of Brazil\u2019s space agency was fired last month after the president disputed the official deforestation data from satellites. An international outcry has prompted Norway and Germany to halt donations to Brazil\u2019s Amazon fund, which supports many environmental NGOs as well as government agencies. There have also been calls for Europe to block a trade deal with Brazil and other South American nations. Bolsonaro suggested the fires were started by environmental NGOs to embarrass his government. \u201cOn the question of burning in the Amazon, which in my opinion may have been initiated by NGOs because they lost money, what is the intention? To bring problems to Brazil,\u201d the president told a steel industry congress in Brasilia. He made a similar allegation earlier in the day when he suggested groups had gone out with cameras and started fires so they could film them. Asked whether he had evidence, or whether he could name the NGOs involved, Bolsonaro said there were no written records and it was just his feeling. Environmental activists said his comments were an absurd attempt to deflect attention from the problem of poor oversight and tacit encouragement of illegal forest clearance. \u201cThose who destroy the Amazon and let deforestation continue unabated are encouraged by the Bolsonaro government\u2019s actions and policies.

In politics, Britain was famously stable while Italy was infamously not. British governments were domestically strong, while Italian governments were weak and short-lived. In Britain, leftwing politics was rooted in industrial unionism, while Italy possessed the largest, most modern-minded and most alluring communist party in the west. When Britain looked in the mirror it saw the embodiment of probity and practicality, while Italy was all too often synonymous with crime and corruption. While Britain maintained its autonomy by refusing to join the eurozone, Italy enthusiastically embraced its upper mid-table place in the EU and its membership of the single currency was shamelessly engineered.</p> <p>Today, the political comparison is marked not by divergence but by an increasing convergence. Politically, Britain is becoming more like Italy. Like Italy, Britain is an increasingly hard to govern country that makes less and less effort to address its underlying economic, social and political problems. Instead, like Italy, Britain appears to be drifting steadily to the right under skilful populist leaders whom the political institutions are proving unable to control.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/20/italy-and-matteo-salvini-face-uncertainty-after-pms-resignation\" title=\"\">collapse of Italy\u2019s populist coalition</a> this week is not, at first sight, an event with many British resonances. Both parties in the coalition are recent creations, a far cry from a Conservative party that traces its history deep into the 19th century. The rightwing Lega is the latest iteration of the old anti-migrant <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/01/northern-league-gains-italian-elections-matteo-salvini\" title=\"\">Lega Nord</a>, which dated from only 1991, while the Five Star Movement is more recent still, a root-and-branch anti-establishment party. Yet the division that brought down the coalition and led to prime minister Giuseppe Conte\u2019s resignation on Tuesday has real echoes of the battles in the Conservative party.</p> <p>Like Theresa May, Conte was forced to quit because the Lega, under Matteo Salvini, has created a position in which it thinks it can win an election. That is precisely the belief that fires Boris Johnson. Salvini\u2019s mix of anti-immigrant braggadocio, confrontational hostility to the EU in general, and to Germany in particular, plus his readiness to borrow and increase the deficit, and his intention, if elected, to slash taxes, has its reflections in Priti Patel\u2019s potentially <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/19/threat-to-end-freedom-of-movement-overnight-reckless-say-eu-citizens\" title=\"\">brutal migration controls</a>, Johnson\u2019s sabre-rattling approach to May\u2019s withdrawal agreement and the UK government\u2019s election-mode fiscal liberality.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0fc4f90c05924eb988f207c709143c7f0529f971\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0fc4f90c05924eb988f207c709143c7f0529f971/0_306_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Matteo Salvini\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The Lega, under Matteo Salvini, has created a position in which it thinks it can win an election.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Masiello/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>None of this is to pretend that Britain and Italy are marching to exactly the same political drum. But if Angela Merkel, who hosted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/aug/21/brexit-latest-news-boris-johnson-berlin-merkel-prepares-to-visit-berlin-as-minister-struggles-to-defend-his-collaborators-jibe-live-news\" title=\"\">Johnson\u2019s first European trip</a> as prime minister on Wednesday, were to be asked privately to nominate her most unwelcome EU leader colleagues, it is a fair bet that Johnson and Salvini would come top of her current list, above even Hungary\u2019s Viktor Orb\u00e1n.</p> <p>The Italian and British rightwing populist leaders, egged on by Donald Trump\u2019s administration in Washington, represent a deliberate challenge to traditional politics in general and to the EU\u2019s future in particular. Until recently, the visit of a British prime minister to the German chancellor was a ritual reaffirmation of commitment to stability. Not any more, and not on Wednesday. It is an alarming thought \u2013 though it should not be overplayed either \u2013 that Wednesday\u2018s was almost certainly the most destabilising Anglo-German summit since Munich in 1938.</p> <p>To add the words \u201cexcept Italy\u201d to every generalisation about Europe would become tiresome, historian AJP Taylor once said. From now on, he <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Struggle_for_Mastery_in_Europe_1848%E2%80%931918\" title=\"\">added</a>, the words should therefore be taken as read. Many of us grew up looking at Italy\u2019s place in Europe in that way. Cooler and more stylish than us, certainly, but also more corrupt and more unshakeably right wing, Italy seemed to follow its own unique and inimitable route through European modernity.</p> <p>For much of the postwar era, this way of looking at Italy made some sense. Compared with centralised France and Britain, Italy was a devolved state. Power lay in the cities and the regions, where Rome\u2019s writ did not run. Compared with Germany and Scandinavia, Italy was economically protectionist, inefficient and institutionally rotten. While the citizens of most countries in Europe liked to think that they obeyed the laws, paid their taxes and provided for their poor, many Italians picked and chose which rules to follow, joked about paying their taxes and were often overtly hostile to the impoverished south of the country, as Salvini is today to African and Arab migrants.</p> <p>For a while, it was possible to believe that, if there were convergence between the two, it would be Italy that managed to change, adapting itself to the liberal democratic capitalist habits of the EU. But that hasn\u2019t happened. Italy\u2019s exceptionalism is now, if anything, more pronounced. Under Johnson, Britain is accelerating in a similar direction of its own. Since the fall of the Syriza government in Greece, Italy and Brexit Britain together pose the most direct challenges to the EU\u2019s legal, budgetary and human rights underpinnings.</p> <p>For the avoidance of doubt, precise parallels between Italy and Britain, or Salvini and Johnson, should not be pushed too far. There remain many profound differences between the two national conjunctures. But their rightward trajectories, their preoccupation with winning votes on the right not the centre, and their mastery of the black arts of political campaigning in the digital age all come from the same soil. Those who have argued for many years for Britain to become more like Germany or Sweden have to wake up to what is happening. Italy and Britain, an improbable political duo if ever there was one, have become the terrible twins of Europe.</p> <p>\u2022 Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnist</p>",

In the past, that was where the similarities began to ebb away. In politics, Britain was famously stable while Italy was infamously not. British governments were domestically strong, while Italian governments were weak and short-lived. In Britain, leftwing politics was rooted in industrial unionism, while Italy possessed the largest, most modern-minded and most alluring communist party in the west. When Britain looked in the mirror it saw the embodiment of probity and practicality, while Italy was all too often synonymous with crime and corruption. While Britain maintained its autonomy by refusing to join the eurozone, Italy enthusiastically embraced its upper mid-table place in the EU and its membership of the single currency was shamelessly engineered. Today, the political comparison is marked not by divergence but by an increasing convergence. Politically, Britain is becoming more like Italy. Like Italy, Britain is an increasingly hard to govern country that makes less and less effort to address its underlying economic, social and political problems. Instead, like Italy, Britain appears to be drifting steadily to the right under skilful populist leaders whom the political institutions are proving unable to control. The collapse of Italy\u2019s populist coalition this week is not, at first sight, an event with many British resonances. Both parties in the coalition are recent creations, a far cry from a Conservative party that traces its history deep into the 19th century. The rightwing Lega is the latest iteration of the old anti-migrant Lega Nord, which dated from only 1991, while the Five Star Movement is more recent still, a root-and-branch anti-establishment party. Yet the division that brought down the coalition and led to prime minister Giuseppe Conte\u2019s resignation on Tuesday has real echoes of the battles in the Conservative party. Like Theresa May, Conte was forced to quit because the Lega, under Matteo Salvini, has created a position in which it thinks it can win an election. That is precisely the belief that fires Boris Johnson. Salvini\u2019s mix of anti-immigrant braggadocio, confrontational hostility to the EU in general, and to Germany in particular, plus his readiness to borrow and increase the deficit, and his intention, if elected, to slash taxes, has its reflections in Priti Patel\u2019s potentially brutal migration controls, Johnson\u2019s sabre-rattling approach to May\u2019s withdrawal agreement and the UK government\u2019s election-mode fiscal liberality. None of this is to pretend that Britain and Italy are marching to exactly the same political drum. But if Angela Merkel, who hosted Johnson\u2019s first European trip as prime minister on Wednesday, were to be asked privately to nominate her most unwelcome EU leader colleagues, it is a fair bet that Johnson and Salvini would come top of her current list, above even Hungary\u2019s Viktor Orb\u00e1n. The Italian and British rightwing populist leaders, egged on by Donald Trump\u2019s administration in Washington, represent a deliberate challenge to traditional politics in general and to the EU\u2019s future in particular. Until recently, the visit of a British prime minister to the German chancellor was a ritual reaffirmation of commitment to stability. Not any more, and not on Wednesday. It is an alarming thought \u2013 though it should not be overplayed either \u2013 that Wednesday\u2018s was almost certainly the most destabilising Anglo-German summit since Munich in 1938. To add the words \u201cexcept Italy\u201d to every generalisation about Europe would become tiresome, historian AJP Taylor once said. From now on, he added, the words should therefore be taken as read. Many of us grew up looking at Italy\u2019s place in Europe in that way. Cooler and more stylish than us, certainly, but also more corrupt and more unshakeably right wing, Italy seemed to follow its own unique and inimitable route through European modernity. For much of the postwar era, this way of looking at Italy made some sense. Compared with centralised France and Britain, Italy was a devolved state. Power lay in the cities and the regions, where Rome\u2019s writ did not run. Compared with Germany and Scandinavia, Italy was economically protectionist, inefficient and institutionally rotten. While the citizens of most countries in Europe liked to think that they obeyed the laws, paid their taxes and provided for their poor, many Italians picked and chose which rules to follow, joked about paying their taxes and were often overtly hostile to the impoverished south of the country, as Salvini is today to African and Arab migrants. For a while, it was possible to believe that, if there were convergence between the two, it would be Italy that managed to change, adapting itself to the liberal democratic capitalist habits of the EU. But that hasn\u2019t happened. Italy\u2019s exceptionalism is now, if anything, more pronounced. Under Johnson, Britain is accelerating in a similar direction of its own. Since the fall of the Syriza government in Greece, Italy and Brexit Britain together pose the most direct challenges to the EU\u2019s legal, budgetary and human rights underpinnings. For the avoidance of doubt, precise parallels between Italy and Britain, or Salvini and Johnson, should not be pushed too far. There remain many profound differences between the two national conjunctures. But their rightward trajectories, their preoccupation with winning votes on the right not the centre, and their mastery of the black arts of political campaigning in the digital age all come from the same soil. Those who have argued for many years for Britain to become more like Germany or Sweden have to wake up to what is happening. Italy and Britain, an improbable political duo if ever there was one, have become the terrible twins of Europe. \u2022 Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnist",

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump on Wednesday repeated an antisemitic trope that has prompted dismay among prominent American Jews, saying that voting Democratic was \u201cdisloyal to Jewish people and \u2026 very disloyal to Israel\u201d. Prominent US Jews have reacted with shock and disdain to Trump\u2019s renewed adoption of a longstanding antisemitic trope that implied that American Jews had divided loyalty to America and to Israel. Over almost 24 hours he has repeatedly described Jewish Americans who vote for Democrats as showing \u201ceither a total lack of knowledge or great disloyalty\u201d. The president ignited the storm when he appeared to accuse Jewish Americans of having dual loyalties in remarks from the Oval Office on Tuesday. Jonathan Greenblatt, chief executive of the Anti-Defamation League, pointed out on Twitter that charges of disloyalty \u201chave long been used to attack Jews \u2026 It\u2019s long overdue to stop using Jews as a political football\u201d. J Street, the progressive Jewish American lobbying group, released a statement in which it called Trump\u2019s remarks \u201cdangerous and shameful\u201d. It noted that 70% of American Jews voted for Hillary Clinton against Trump in the 2016 presidential race, adding: \u201cThis vast majority of our community rejected and continues to abhor the xenophobia, bigotry and extremism of Donald Trump and his allies.\u201d Trump reiterated his contentious comments on Wednesday morning, bragging about the praise he had received overnight from a notorious rightwing conspiracy theorist. Wayne Allyn Root, a conservative talk radio host who has championed many virulent untruths, including the \u201cbirther\u201d conspiracy theory that Barack Obama was not a US citizen, lauded Trump on air as \u201cthe greatest president for Jews and for Israel in the history of the world\u201d. In a stream of tweets, Trump cited Root as saying that Israelis loved the US president \u201clike he\u2019s the King of Israel. They love him like he is the second coming of God.\u201d A reference to the second coming was unfortunate, given the context. The president returned to the subject yet again later on Wednesday as he addressed reporters on the South Lawn of the White House before his Marine One departure to Kentucky, where he was scheduled to speak to military veterans. Despite the furor surrounding his claims, he made his most specific suggestion yet that American Jews intrinsically have divided fealty. \u201cIf you vote for a Democrat, you\u2019re being disloyal to Jewish people and you\u2019re being very disloyal to Israel,\u201d he said, denying that his words were antisemitic. Trump ignited the storm on Tuesday afternoon when he unleashed a barrage of disparaging comments against the Democratic congresswomen Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan. Trump, who recently encouraged Israel to block Tlaib\u2019s visit to see her family in the occupied territories, lashed out after the congresswomen criticized Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government for denying them entry, vowing that the Israeli leader would not \u201csucceed in hiding the cruel reality of the occupation from us\u201d. Calling Omar a \u201cdisaster\u201d for Jews, Trump said he didn\u2019t \u201cbuy\u201d the tears Tlaib had shed Monday at an emotional press conference during which Tlaib talked about her decision not to travel to Israel to see her elderly grandmother, who lives in the occupied West Bank. \u201cWhere has the Democratic party gone?\u201d Trump asked reporters at the White House. \u201cWhere have they gone, where they\u2019re defending these two people over the state of Israel? And I think any Jewish people that vote for a Democrat, I think it shows either a total lack of knowledge or great disloyalty.\u201d This was not the first time that Trump has been castigated for apparently invoking the \u201cdual loyalty\u201d antisemitic trope. In April, he called Netanyahu \u201cyour prime minister\u201d in front of the annual meeting of the Republican Jewish Coalition in Las Vegas. Leading Jewish Democratic politicians also excoriated Trump for his comments. Bernie Sanders, the independent senator from Vermont who is a contender for the 2020 Democratic nomination, pronounced himself to be \u201ca proud Jewish person\u201d. Sanders said: \u201cI have no concerns about voting Democratic. And in fact I intend to vote for a Jewish man to become the next president of the United States.\u201d Ted Deutch, a Democratic congressman from Florida who has supported aspects of Trump\u2019s Israel policy in the past, including the decision to relocate the US embassy to Jerusalem, was also harshly critical. Talking to the CBS franchise in Miami, he called on Trump to apologize. \u201cIt would be an enormous start if we can all acknowledge there is no place for language like that,\u201d he said.

      "bodyText": "A former director of Bury FC has chained herself to a drainpipe at the club\u2019s stadium in a bid to save the beleaguered team from impending extinction. The club, one of the oldest in the league, is due to be expelled from the English Football League (EFL) on Friday unless it can provide financial information showing that it can pay its debts and adequately function. Joy Hart, who was club director during the 2014-15 season, said that 135 years of history would be dead if the expulsion went ahead. Speaking to the Guardian while handcuffed outside the main entrance of the Gigg Lane stadium, Hart said she hoped to maintain her protest for \u201cas long as possible\u201d in order to draw attention to the club\u2019s plight. \u201cI\u2019m doing this because I love Bury football club so much, as do all the other supporters,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m just doing my bit.\u201d Hart said her original plan had been to shackle herself to the Les Hart stand, the south stand named after her father, a Bury FC player who devoted 44 years of his career to the club, but \u201cI\u2019m afraid someone at the club has locked the gates, so that\u2019s kiboshed that. \u201cI\u2019m really on display to anyone who is passing. I\u2019m protesting today because Bury football club is a football league club with 135 years of history. We\u2019ve won the FA cup twice over the years, just like our esteemed neighbours, [Manchester] United, even your Liverpools and your Evertons. But we just don\u2019t have their money.\u201d Hart accused the last two chairmans of \u201ckilling the club financially\u201d. The current owner, Steve Dale, bought the club in December for \u00a31 and is believed to have turned down offers from potential buyers. Hart pleaded with the EFL to extend the Friday deadline. \u201cPlease give us longer time for someone or some persons or some clubs to put some money into us and save this 135-year football league club. We matter just as much as the clubs that are in the Premiership.\u201d Hart said the club\u2019s demise would \u201ckill the town\u201d, leading to the collapse of local businesses and pubs. \u201cEvery large town should have a football club where the community can come together. 135 years of history will be dead on Friday if Mr Dale doesn\u2019t sell.\u201d James Frith, the MP for Bury North, who has lobbied the EFL to give the club more time to find a buyer, said he supported Hart\u2019s protest. Frith said: \u201cI commend Joy\u2019s protest today for what is the latest in a long line of statements of exasperation at the crisis facing our club. The desperation faced by so many across our town is real, as Bury FC faces extinction.

      "bodyText": "A peaceful rally at a metro station in Hong Kong descended into a clash between protesters and police as the city entered the 11th week of anti-government demonstrations. Hundreds of people took part in a sit-in at the out-of-town Yuen Long metro station earlier on Wednesday in protest at a violent and indiscriminate attack on commuters and protesters there a month ago. Dozens of men clad in white T-shirts rushed into the station late at night on 21 July and beat people both inside the station and on trains with canes and wooden sticks. Police were widely criticised for being absent during the attack. The rally on Wednesday night passed without incident for about three hours until shortly before 10pm local time (1500 BST), when dozens of protesters confronted riot police standing guard outside the station and nearby villages. Protesters shone laser pointers at about 100 riot police armed with shields and guns, before the officers started charging towards them. Demonstrators placed bins and plastic traffic barriers on the road as barricades but the police swiftly removed them. As the police charged, protesters shouted: \u201cTriads! Triads!\u201d Demonstrators then retreated to the metro station, pursued by large numbers of riot police. The police stopped outside the station as protesters used a fire hose to spray water and left oil and detergent on the floor in an apparent attempt to prevent the police from entering. Makeshift barricades were then set up by protesters inside the station using bins, magazine stands and other objects, while walls, ceilings and ticket machines were hit rhythmically with umbrellas and other items. At one point the atmosphere turned tense as police raised a blue flag to warn protesters that they were engaged in an illegal meeting and the officers could use force. The standoff continued for nearly an hour, with protesters throwing objects at the police including bottles, umbrellas and even yellow rubber ducks. The black-clad demonstrators squirted fire extinguishers to create smoke as they retreated. Many shouted slogans frequently used in the recent anti-extradition protests, including \u201creclaim Hong Kong, revolution of our time!\u201d. The police backed off shortly after 11pm and protesters began to leave. Police did not use teargas, rubber bullets and beanbag rounds to disperse the crowds, which marks a departure from the usual pattern of tactics over the past two months. Resentment against police violence has grown in recent weeks after an increasing use of force to disperse protesters, with innocent bystanders and local residents also affected. Earlier on Wednesday evening, during a five-minute silence to mark the 21 July attack, some protesters covered one eye in a gesture of solidarity with a young woman whose eye was badly injured in one of the August protests. And at a press conference protesters wearing black T-shirts, hard hats and dark glasses, with scarves covering their faces, condemned police tactics. They also accused the government of condoning violent attacks by rural clans and gangsters. They noted that although dozens of attackers in Yuen Long had been arrested, none had been prosecuted so far. The wave of protests in Hong Kong, which started in early June to oppose a controversial extradition bill under which individuals could be sent to China for trial, has grown into a broader movement with five demands: the complete withdrawal of the now-suspended extradition bill; the setting up of an independent body to investigate police violence; a halt to the characterisation of protests as \u201criots\u201d; an amnesty for those arrested; and a resumption of political reform to allow the free election of Hong Kong\u2019s leader and legislature and the resignation of Carrie Lam, the current leader.",

They meet at Taunton in the final round next month.<br></p> <p>Somerset, eight without loss overnight, achieved their target for the loss of five wickets after tea. They wobbled at 49 for three, only for dynamic quartet Babar Azam (40), Tom Banton (66), George Bartlett and Dom Bess to see them home. Bartlett and Bess shared an unbroken sixth-wicket stand of 88 either side of tea, finishing unbeaten on 54 and 40.<br></p> <p>Off-spinner Bess spent a short loan period with fellow title rivals <strong>Yorkshire</strong> earlier this season. When they were denied permission for an extension of the deal, the White Rose called upon South African Test left-armer Keshav Maharaj, who has since taken 28 wickets in four games as their overseas player.<br></p> <p>Maharaj finished with six for 95 as winless <strong>Notts</strong> were bowled out for 243 two overs after lunch chasing 387 at Scarborough. Discussions are already ongoing about his return next summer. He will play his final game of 2019 against Somerset at Taunton (September 10-13), a game they will go into 37 points behind Essex. Bottom side Notts are 42 behind second-bottom Warwickshire.</p> <p><strong>Surrey</strong>\u2019s Ollie Pope scored his second first-class career double hundred, both of which have come in the last five months, and then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/21/third-ashes-test-headingley-england-australia-cricket-roy\">weaved his way up the M1</a> to Headingley in case he is required for the third Ashes Test.<br></p> <p>The 21-year-old swashbuckler will add to the two caps he won against India last August should Jason Roy be ruled out with concussion, and Pope could hardly be better prepared despite a disruptive summer following shoulder surgery. After hitting 251 in the MCC champion county fixture in late March, he badly dislocated his left shoulder while fielding one month later.</p> <p>After returning to T20 action over the last few weeks with limited success, he marked his first Championship appearance of 2019 in fine style, underpinning Surrey\u2019s first-innings 579 for six (declared) against <strong>Hampshire</strong> with 221 not out off 337 balls. He looked particularly strong off his legs and through the covers, hitting 22 boundaries.<br></p> <p>Pope began day four on 176 and left the field when Surrey declared, leading by 212 at 12.10pm.

I had no problem with the way we went about our batting in the first innings. I said to the lads after the first day, \u2018Sometimes you have to just give the opposition credit\u2019. I thought Luke Wood probably bowled one of the best spells he has done in his career. <br></p> <p>\u201cYes, we gave them a couple of wickets out of the 10 that we lost, but the attitude and approach to it was good. It just happened that we were 13-4. But I thought the partnership between Tim Bresnan and Jonny Tattersall [121 for the sixth wicket] was the biggest difference in the game. They showed a lot of character and skill.\u201d<br></p> <p>South African Test spinner Keshav Maharaj claimed eight wickets in the match, including six in the second innings, as the hosts comfortably defended a 387 target to win for the second time at Scarborough this year. They are 37 points behind leaders Essex with three games remaining.<br></p> <p>Gale added: \u201cKeshav\u2019s been huge for us. I think one of the lads just said he\u2019s got 28 wickets in four games. When you get a total like that on the board second innings and there\u2019s a bit in the pitch, having a world-class spinner is massive.\u201d On Yorkshire\u2019s title hopes, Gale said: \u201cKent sort of messed it up against Essex. All we can do is control what we\u2019re doing. We\u2019re playing some good cricket in this format.\u201d</p> <p>Nottinghamshire stand-in captain Chris Nash was frustrated that his side remain winless. And despite the odd positive here and there \u2013 Liam Patterson-White\u2019s all-round display, for example \u2013 he bemoaned his side\u2019s inability to convert a position of authority in the first innings. <br></p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard when you\u2019re in the position we are, at the bottom of the table having lost another game, to draw on any positives. I know people will get sick of us talking about positives, but there were some,\u201d he said.<br></p> <p>\u201cUltimately, we had them 38-5 and let them get 60 or so more than we\u2019d have liked. Then we\u2019re 180 odd all out from 90-2. That\u2019s the switch in the game and the 140 runs we\u2019re looking for. It\u2019s disappointing in that respect.\u201d</p> <p>Ravi Ashwin returns for the latter stages of the Championship campaign, and Nash added: \u201cWe haven\u2019t won a game all season and have lost a lot following some bad sessions.

Of the nine games we started the week with across the two divisions, we only have five left in play, including this one between <strong>Yorkshire</strong> and <strong>Nottinghamshire</strong>.</p> <p>There is every chance that the top three sides in Division One will win. After leaders Essex completed their come-from-behind success over Kent at Canterbury yesterday, it is down to Yorkshire and <strong>Somerset</strong>, who are chasing 258 to beat <strong>Warwickshire</strong> at Edgbaston, to follow suit. Somerset\u2019s win is the one which is most in the balance. They will begin day four on 8-0.</p> <p>Third-placed Yorkshire need six wickets with Notts, chasing 387, on 135-4. Ben Duckett is unbeaten on 47. The Yorkshire hierarchy have always played down their title chances, right from the end of last season in fact. </p> <p>I remember chatting to Andrew Gale in the first week of October when they played in a T20 competition in Abu Dhabi and he said then, \u201cWe\u2019re a young, developing side, consolidation is key\u201d. I\u2019m paraphrasing a touch, but you get the picture. </p> <p>Only last week, Gale said the title would be a big bonus. If we assume Yorkshire win, they will go into the final three rounds 37 points adrift of Essex with Somerset, their next opponents at Taunton next month, sandwiched in between. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b4739d3b7abe60a143a719f043bb941c6e4979ee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b4739d3b7abe60a143a719f043bb941c6e4979ee/0_295_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Yorkshire\u2019s players take to the field in Scarborough.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yorkshire\u2019s players take to the field in Scarborough.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Sellers/SWpix.com/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I was very impressed with Notts yesterday. Yorkshire started the day leading by 225 with eight wickets in hand in their second innings, so it would have been easy for Notts to crumble. But they didn\u2019t. They bowled well, lead by five wickets for Luke Fletcher in the afternoon.</p> <p>Champions <strong>Surrey</strong>, out of the title race, have an outside chance of victory against <strong>Hampshire</strong> at the Oval. At 490-5 in reply to 367, they lead by 123 at the start of the day. How great is it to see Ollie Pope back in the swing of things after his early season shoulder injury? He is 176 not out and could easily take James Vince and co to task this morning.</p> <p>The key fixture in Division Two today sees <strong>Durham</strong> try to complete a victory over <strong>Leicestershire</strong> at the Riverside which would throw them right into the thick of the promotion race. Leicestershire will resume their second innings on 153-3 and still trail their hosts by 155.</p> <p><strong>Gloucestershire</strong> are also in the hunt for a top-three finish, but their clash at <strong>Derbyshire</strong> is likely to finish in a draw. Derbyshire, 305-3 in their second innings overnight, lead by 86. Every time I seem to see Derbyshire or look at a scorecard, Billy Godleman has got runs. He notched 86 yesterday. How many runs has he got this season across all formats? There won\u2019t be many batsmen with more, I would suspect.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-08-21T12:00:29.957Z\">at 1.00pm BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Somerset successfully chased 258 at Edgbaston to beat Warwickshire and close the gap to leaders Essex to just two points with three rounds remaining. They meet at Taunton in the final round next month. Somerset, eight without loss overnight, achieved their target for the loss of five wickets after tea. They wobbled at 49 for three, only for dynamic quartet Babar Azam (40), Tom Banton (66), George Bartlett and Dom Bess to see them home. Bartlett and Bess shared an unbroken sixth-wicket stand of 88 either side of tea, finishing unbeaten on 54 and 40. Off-spinner Bess spent a short loan period with fellow title rivals Yorkshire earlier this season. When they were denied permission for an extension of the deal, the White Rose called upon South African Test left-armer Keshav Maharaj, who has since taken 28 wickets in four games as their overseas player. Maharaj finished with six for 95 as winless Notts were bowled out for 243 two overs after lunch chasing 387 at Scarborough. Discussions are already ongoing about his return next summer. He will play his final game of 2019 against Somerset at Taunton (September 10-13), a game they will go into 37 points behind Essex. Bottom side Notts are 42 behind second-bottom Warwickshire. Surrey\u2019s Ollie Pope scored his second first-class career double hundred, both of which have come in the last five months, and then weaved his way up the M1 to Headingley in case he is required for the third Ashes Test. The 21-year-old swashbuckler will add to the two caps he won against India last August should Jason Roy be ruled out with concussion, and Pope could hardly be better prepared despite a disruptive summer following shoulder surgery. After hitting 251 in the MCC champion county fixture in late March, he badly dislocated his left shoulder while fielding one month later. After returning to T20 action over the last few weeks with limited success, he marked his first Championship appearance of 2019 in fine style, underpinning Surrey\u2019s first-innings 579 for six (declared) against Hampshire with 221 not out off 337 balls. He looked particularly strong off his legs and through the covers, hitting 22 boundaries. Pope began day four on 176 and left the field when Surrey declared, leading by 212 at 12.10pm. By 12.45pm, he had departed for Leeds, where he arrived via car. Hampshire (253 for five) later held on for a draw in the mid-table battle. While Leicestershire\u2019s Mark Cosgrove brilliantly held up Durham\u2019s Division Two promotion bid with a match-saving unbeaten 107 at the Riverside, Gloucestershire chased 263 in 49 overs to win by eight wickets with 11 balls remaining at Derby and move into second place. Opener James Bracey led the way with a superb unbeaten 116. Surrey and Hampshire have now shaken hands at the Oval, the match ending in a draw. In Division Two, bad light has brought a halt to Leicestershire v Durham, while Gloucestershire need 63 runs to beat Derbyshire with nine wickets in hand. That\u2019s all for today, but keep your eyes peeled for our roundup of the final day\u2019s play, which will be here later. The two games which look like being draws \u2013 Surrey v Hampshire in Division One and Durham v Leicestershire in Division Two \u2013 are still going. I was half-thinking they may have shaken hands at 5pm. Hampshire lead by 20 with five wickets left and Leicester lead by 23 with four left. The other match, Derbyshire v Gloucestershire, is very much alive at Derby and going the way of the visitors. They are 142-1, needing 121 more with just under 17 overs left. The title race: Here\u2019s how the Division One table looks after Somerset and Yorkshire added to their win tallies today. Essex \u2013 188 points Somerset \u2013 186 points Yorkshire \u2013 151 points Remaining fixtures: Essex: Warwickshire (A), Surrey (H), Somerset (A) Somerset: Yorkshire (H), Hampshire (A), Essex (H) Yorkshire: Somerset (A), Kent (H), Warwickshire (A) Somerset have won by five wickets. That\u2019s great news for the title race, but not so much for Essex. George Bartlett 54 not out and Dom Bess 40 not out, sharing an unbroken 88 for the sixth wicket in their pursuit of 258. The gap is two points with three games to go. Somerset are nearly there now. They need just 14 more runs with five wickets in hand. In Division Two meanwhile, Gloucestershire look like they will give their 263 target a go at Derbyshire. They are 76-0 with 29 overs remaining and James Bracey and Chris Dent at the crease. Here\u2019s a tea update from around the grounds, with a quartet of games still in play: Division One Warwickshire v Somerset, Edgbaston - Somerset are closing in on a win which take them two points behind leaders Essex with three games to play, including a meeting between the two at Taunton in the final week of the season. They are 215-5 chasing 258 - 43 more required. Surrey v Hampshire, Oval - Hampshire are 184-5 in their second innings, trailing by 28. Amar Virdi has taken three wickets with his off-spinners. Division Two Derbyshire v Gloucestershire, Derby - Gloucestershire are 48-0 chasing 263. That would be a huge win in their promotion push. Durham v Leicestershire, Riverside - Leicestershire, made to follow-on earlier in the game, are 304-6 in their second innings, trailing by four runs. Given Durham\u2019s position in the promotion shake-up, that\u2019s a big final session coming up. It\u2019s a bit too early to say that Somerset are nearly there at Edgbaston, but they are closing in. At 197-5 chasing 258 and with George Bartlett and Dom Bess set, they need 61 more for a massive victory in their season. Here\u2019s some reaction from the two camps at Scarborough, firstly from winning Yorkshire coach Andrew Gale, who was delighted with his side\u2019s recovery from 13-4 on the first morning. \u201cFrom there, we drove the game,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a good win. I had no problem with the way we went about our batting in the first innings. I said to the lads after the first day, \u2018Sometimes you have to just give the opposition credit\u2019. I thought Luke Wood probably bowled one of the best spells he has done in his career. \u201cYes, we gave them a couple of wickets out of the 10 that we lost, but the attitude and approach to it was good. It just happened that we were 13-4. But I thought the partnership between Tim Bresnan and Jonny Tattersall [121 for the sixth wicket] was the biggest difference in the game. They showed a lot of character and skill.\u201d South African Test spinner Keshav Maharaj claimed eight wickets in the match, including six in the second innings, as the hosts comfortably defended a 387 target to win for the second time at Scarborough this year. They are 37 points behind leaders Essex with three games remaining. Gale added: \u201cKeshav\u2019s been huge for us. I think one of the lads just said he\u2019s got 28 wickets in four games. When you get a total like that on the board second innings and there\u2019s a bit in the pitch, having a world-class spinner is massive.\u201d On Yorkshire\u2019s title hopes, Gale said: \u201cKent sort of messed it up against Essex. All we can do is control what we\u2019re doing. We\u2019re playing some good cricket in this format.\u201d Nottinghamshire stand-in captain Chris Nash was frustrated that his side remain winless. And despite the odd positive here and there \u2013 Liam Patterson-White\u2019s all-round display, for example \u2013 he bemoaned his side\u2019s inability to convert a position of authority in the first innings. \u201cIt\u2019s hard when you\u2019re in the position we are, at the bottom of the table having lost another game, to draw on any positives. I know people will get sick of us talking about positives, but there were some,\u201d he said. \u201cUltimately, we had them 38-5 and let them get 60 or so more than we\u2019d have liked. Then we\u2019re 180 odd all out from 90-2. That\u2019s the switch in the game and the 140 runs we\u2019re looking for. It\u2019s disappointing in that respect.\u201d Ravi Ashwin returns for the latter stages of the Championship campaign, and Nash added: \u201cWe haven\u2019t won a game all season and have lost a lot following some bad sessions. But you never know. We\u2019ll keep working hard and see where we get to.\u201d Big wicket for Warwickshire debutant George Garrett, who has trapped Babar Azam lbw for 40, ending a 90-run stand with Tom Banton for the fourth Somerset wicket. That left Somerset at 139-4 chasing 258. They are now 144-4, with Banton still there on 57. That\u2019s going to be a fascinating finish. There have been two early afternoon wickets at Derby, where the hosts are 411-5 leading by 192. Tom Lace (125) and Leus du Plooy have both fallen. Ah, as I type, Luke Fletcher is lbw Maharaj. 243-9. Yorkshire nearly there. They would go 37 points behind Essex with three games to play. Maharaj has taken five wickets in an innings for the second match running. Now six. Jake Ball is caught at slip. That\u2019s it. 243 all out. Yorkshire win by 143 runs. Here\u2019s a lunch update from around the grounds: Division One Surrey v Hampshire, Oval - Ollie Pope finished 221 not out as Surrey set up a first-innings lead of 212, and he has since been called up as injury cover for Jason Roy at Headingley for the third Ashes Test. Hampshire are 38-1 at lunch. Warwickshire v Somerset, Edgbaston - Second-placed Somerset, chasing 258, have advanced from 8-0 overnight to 87-3. They are aiming to cut the gap to two points between themselves and leaders Essex. Yorkshire v Nottinghamshire, Scarborough - Yorkshire need two more wickets for victory over the bottom side having taken four morning wickets. Notts are 238-8 chasing 387. Liam Patterson-White has played nicely for 55 not out - his first fifty. Division Two Derbyshire v Gloucestershire, Derby - Wicketless session as the hosts pile on the runs in their second innings. Centurion Tom Lace and Leus du Plooy have shared 145 unbroken for the fourth wicket. At 385-3, they lead by 166. Durham v Leicestershire, Riverside - Leicestershire holding on to frustrate their promotion chasing hosts. Also a wicketless morning, with Mark Cosgrove and Colin Ackermann cutting their deficit to 88 at 220-3 having been made to follow on in reply to 544-9 declared. The man of the moment, Ollie Pope, is on his way to Headingley as a standby for Jason Roy, who will continue to be monitored for concussion. Notts are now 219-8 after wickets for Tim Bresnan and Keshav Maharaj. An impressive maiden fifty for Liam Patterson-White. Born in Sunderland, not a million miles from Scarborough, LPW (a nickname I have made up on the spot) has just lofted Keshav Maharaj straight over the sight screen for six to get him there off 98 balls. It thudded into the press box wall as well. A bit higher and my laptop could have been toast. Notts are now 210-6, needing 177 more to win. Plenty more action in Division One ... Wickets at Edgbaston and here at Scarborough, and a declaration at the Oval. Tom Abell has been trapped lbw by Henry Brookes, with Somerset now 58-3, needing 200 more to win. Keshav Maharaj has just ousted Tom Moores, caught at short-leg, and Notts are 191-6. At the Oval, Surrey have declared their first-innings reply to Hampshire\u2019s 367 on 579-7, meaning a lead of 212. Ollie Pope finished on 221 not out. There has still not been a wicket in Division Two. Derbyshire are 349-3 in their second innings at home to Gloucestershire, leading by 130. Leicestershire are 191-3 second time around at Durham and still trail by 117 having been asked to follow-on in reply to 544-9 declared. And another head blow as I type \u2013 Duanne Olivier has just sconned Paul Coughlin. Ball-to-head in cricket is very much a hot topic at the moment, but there can be few stranger examples than this, from Leicestershire\u2019s Mark Cosgrove off the bowling of Ben Raine at the Riverside: Duanne Olivier has removed Ben Duckett for 75, caught at point off a leading edge as he tried to play to leg (Notts 181-5), while Ollie Pope has reached 200 at the Oval. Surrey will set up a victory pursuit later in the day in their mid-table battle with Hampshire. They are 186 in front at 553-6. A second wicket falls at Edgbaston, with Somerset 42-2 as James Hildreth is trapped lbw by Ollie Hannon-Dalby. Babar Azam has arrived at the crease, while Ollie Pope is in the 190s at the Oval. Here at Scarbados, Ben Duckett is holding Yorkshire up. He has 71 not out from 171-4 as Notts face the all-South African attack of Keshav Maharaj and Duanne Olivier. Their target is 387. In Division Two, it has been a wicketless start to the day at Derbyshire and Durham. Breakthrough for Warwickshire. Steve Davies has been caught behind off Ollie Hannon-Dalby. Somerset are 33-1. Surrey have lost their sixth wicket at the Oval, Ben Foakes bowled by Kyle Abbott. But Ollie Pope is still there on 183. At 502-6, they lead Hampshire by 135. More importantly in the grand scheme of Division One, Somerset have made a solid start to the day as they chase 258 to beat Warwickshire at Edgbaston. They have moved from 8-0 to 29-0 thanks to Tom Abell and Steve Davies. It has been an eventful first two overs at Scarborough, in which Ben Duckett has reached his third fifty of the season with a boundary to long-leg off Ben Coad, who had only just dropped a return catch with the left-hander on 47. Liam Patterson-White also edged Steve Patterson in between two slips and a gully for four. Notts are 143-4 chasing 387. England have also announced their schedule for next summer: England will next year play six Tests as part of the ICC World Test Championship, six ODIs and T20 matches against four different national sides. The ECB\u2019s summer 2020 schedule sets up fixtures with West Indies, Ashes rivals Australia, Pakistan and Ireland. England will be looking to gain revenge after losing the Test series in the Caribbean last winter and begin their three-match series against West Indies at the Oval in June. The second Test follows at Edgbaston with the third Test taking place at Lord\u2019s. Australia return to England for a three-match T20 series across the north of England with matches at the Riverside, Headingley and Old Trafford. In July and August, Pakistan arrive for a three-Test series at Lord\u2019s, Old Trafford and Trent Bridge as well as three T20s at at Headingley, Sophia Gardens and the Ageas Bowl. Trent Bridge, Edgbaston and the Oval then host a three-match ODI series against Ireland. Away from the county scene, here\u2019s some good Ashes news for England ... Jason Roy has passed a concussion test and is fit to play in the third Test at Headingley, starting tomorrow. The Surrey man was struck by a throw-down from former international Marcus Trescothick, who is working with the team in a temporary capacity, during practice yesterday. Roy was assessed after impact and was able to continue batting, but also required a follow-up check on the eve of the match to determine any delayed symptoms. That is how Steve Smith was ruled out of this match following his Jofra Archer neck blow on Saturday. He was fine to continue batting following a short time off the field, only to report delayed symptoms on Sunday morning. Good morning from Scarborough ahead of the fourth and final day of this latest round of Championship fixtures. Of the nine games we started the week with across the two divisions, we only have five left in play, including this one between Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire. There is every chance that the top three sides in Division One will win. After leaders Essex completed their come-from-behind success over Kent at Canterbury yesterday, it is down to Yorkshire and Somerset, who are chasing 258 to beat Warwickshire at Edgbaston, to follow suit. Somerset\u2019s win is the one which is most in the balance. They will begin day four on 8-0. Third-placed Yorkshire need six wickets with Notts, chasing 387, on 135-4. Ben Duckett is unbeaten on 47. The Yorkshire hierarchy have always played down their title chances, right from the end of last season in fact. I remember chatting to Andrew Gale in the first week of October when they played in a T20 competition in Abu Dhabi and he said then, \u201cWe\u2019re a young, developing side, consolidation is key\u201d. I\u2019m paraphrasing a touch, but you get the picture. Only last week, Gale said the title would be a big bonus. If we assume Yorkshire win, they will go into the final three rounds 37 points adrift of Essex with Somerset, their next opponents at Taunton next month, sandwiched in between. I was very impressed with Notts yesterday. Yorkshire started the day leading by 225 with eight wickets in hand in their second innings, so it would have been easy for Notts to crumble. But they didn\u2019t. They bowled well, lead by five wickets for Luke Fletcher in the afternoon. Champions Surrey, out of the title race, have an outside chance of victory against Hampshire at the Oval. At 490-5 in reply to 367, they lead by 123 at the start of the day. How great is it to see Ollie Pope back in the swing of things after his early season shoulder injury? He is 176 not out and could easily take James Vince and co to task this morning. The key fixture in Division Two today sees Durham try to complete a victory over Leicestershire at the Riverside which would throw them right into the thick of the promotion race. Leicestershire will resume their second innings on 153-3 and still trail their hosts by 155. Gloucestershire are also in the hunt for a top-three finish, but their clash at Derbyshire is likely to finish in a draw. Derbyshire, 305-3 in their second innings overnight, lead by 86. Every time I seem to see Derbyshire or look at a scorecard, Billy Godleman has got runs. He notched 86 yesterday. How many runs has he got this season across all formats? There won\u2019t be many batsmen with more, I would suspect.",

      "bodyText": "Ryanair has failed in a legal effort to prevent a 48-hour strike by British pilots in the run-up to the bank holiday weekend, but claimed passengers were unlikely to be affected because it could still run a full schedule on both days. The Dublin-based carrier had earlier been granted an injunction to stop a separate 48-hour strike by pilots based in Ireland, halting planned action by 180 members of the Irish Air Line Pilots\u2019 Association (Ialpa). But the high court in London ruled pilots represented by the British Airline Pilots\u2019 Association (Balpa) could press ahead with their strike, which begins at 12.01am on Thursday. A further 72-hour strike is due to begin on 2 September. In a statement that omitted to mention the court\u2019s verdict, Ryanair said: \u201cWe do not expect significant disruptions on Thurs [sic] or Friday, however we cannot rule out some small flight delays and/or flight changes. We are working hard with our pilots teams [sic] to minimise any such delays for our customers and their families.\u201d The airline said passengers booked to travel over the 48-hour period should arrive at airports as normal and could expect to depart on time. The carrier claimed pilots were asking for their income to be doubled from \u00a3170,000 a year to more than \u00a3375,500 \u201cjust nine weeks before Brexit, which could severely damage Ryanair\u2019s business and UK pilot jobs\u201d. But Balpa\u2019s general secretary, Brian Strutton, said the figure was \u201cpurely designed to exaggerate\u201d the union\u2019s demands. \u201cThe public know enough about Ryanair to take their spin with a massive heap of salt,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to address issues like pensions, loss of licence insurance, maternity benefits, allowances, and harmonise pay across the UK in a fair, transparent and consistent structure.\u201d Both sides called on each other to return to the negotiating table, with Balpa describing Ryanair as \u201cfoolish\u201d for seeking to block walkouts through the courts. Strutton said: \u201cWe offered to meet Ryanair management at Acas to negotiate a resolution, but instead they attempted a legal bludgeon. That\u2019s backfired.\u201d Ryanair said: \u201cBritish pilots earning six-figure annual salaries should not be threatening the holiday flights of thousands of British passengers and their families (very few of whom earn over \u00a3170,000 per annum).\u201d The consumer group Which? called on Ryanair not to attempt to \u201cfob off\u201d any customers entitled to compensation if flights are disrupted. \u201cThe threat of more travel chaos over this busy bank holiday weekend will be a crushing blow for passengers who are likely to have spent weeks worrying about whether their holiday flights will take off,\u201d said Adam French, a consumer rights expert. \u201cRyanair now needs to take every possible step to minimise disruption by informing passengers likely to be affected and offering refunds or alternative transport as required by law in the event of cancellation \u2013 if necessary, on other airlines. \u201cThe airline already has a track record of trying to shirk its responsibility to pay compensation to passengers when strikes by its staff go ahead, so we would expect the aviation regulator to step in and take strong action at the first sign of the airline trying to fob off its customers.\u201d While Balpa\u2019s strike will go ahead, a planned walkout by Irish pilots will not. The Irish high court agreed with legal arguments made by Ryanair that Ialpa had not allowed for a mediation process to be completed before announcing the strike. In a tweet after the ruling, Ryanair said the injunction prevents a \u201csmall minority\u201d of Irish pilots from striking, \u201cwhich will come as a huge relief to thousands of Irish passengers and their families during the last week of the school holidays\u201d. For many years, Ryanair refused to recognise trade unions, but it changed stance at the beginning of 2018 after an error caused the airline to mismanage its pilot rostering schedule. The carrier was forced to cancel hundreds of flights, putting itself at the mercy of pilots to resolve the mess. Last month, Ryanair\u2019s chief executive, Michael O\u2019Leary, told staff to prepare for up to 900 job cuts as he warned expansion plans would be slowed dramatically after the grounding of the Boeing 737 Max. He said in a video message to employees that Ryanair had an excess of 500 pilots and about 400 cabin crew. Earlier this year, Ryanair was named the UK\u2019s least-liked short-haul airline for the sixth year running in a Which? survey of passengers.",

The claim came after the findings of an Iraqi government inquiry into the huge blast at the facility of the Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF) were leaked. A spokesman for the PMF said it had intelligence that showed the US had brought in four Israeli drones earlier this year to work as part of the US fleet in Iraq and target militia positions in the country. Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis said the PMF would from now on use \u201call means at its disposal to deter and prevent such attacks on our positions\u201d.

      "body": "<p>It was January in Paris \u2013 cold, gray \u2013 when a ceremony held on the Champ-de-Mars roiled the city\u2019s elite. Military officials and civilians gathered to watch as a young Jewish artillery officer was punished for his alleged treason. Days earlier Alfred Dreyfus had been convicted of passing secrets to the Germans in a rushed court-martial. A French army officer stripped his insignia medals, took his sword and broke it over his knee. Dreyfus was marched around the courtyard of the \u00c9cole Militaire as crowds jeered and spat. Cries of \u201cJew!\u201d and \u201cJudas!\u201d drowned out his muffled professions of loyalty to the French state.</p> <p>The scene was striking \u2013 in the shadow of the newly built Eiffel Tower, a symbol of modernity, an almost primal witch-hunt unfolded. A once decorated army servant pleaded for pity as his neighbors called out \u201cdeath to the Jew\u201d. Dreyfus was exonerated two years later. The message of his trial was clear: even in a cosmopolitan city, in a country whose revolutionary myth called for liberty and equality, leaders could baselessly point their people\u2019s animus toward the other in their midst.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/21/jew-baiting--trump-playbook-its-a-feature-not-a-bug\">Jew-baiting is part of the Trump playbook. It's a feature, not a bug | Lloyd Green</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There\u2019s a sordid history to charges of Jewish dual loyalty in the US In the early years of the second world war, <a href=\"https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/the-united-states-isolation-intervention\">isolationists opposed</a> to American involvement dismissed the war as little more than a \u201cJewish cause\u201d. Charles Lindbergh berated Jewish leaders for \u201cagitating for war\u201d. Decades later, when the US senator Joe Lieberman ran on the Democratic ticket for vice-president, pundits <a href=\"https://www.adl.org/blog/straight-talk-on-the-charge-of-jewish-disloyalty\">questioned</a> whether he was more loyal to Israel than to the US. During the democratic primaries in 2015, the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders was <a href=\"https://www.adl.org/news/media-watch/nprs-diane-rehm-plays-into-classic-anti-semitic-charges-of-dual-loyalty\">challenged</a> on his \u201cdual citizenship\u201d with Israel.</p> <p>The larger question animating these statements is clear: when push comes to shove, will you disavow your differences? As many <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/08/14/magazine/1619-america-slavery.html\">writers and thinkers have shown</a>, white American political leaders have spent much of the country\u2019s history \u2013 from slavery, to Jim Crow, to the disenfranchised carceral state \u2013 attempting to construct an American patriotism whose core tenet is whiteness. That is a project white Jews can fit into, so long as they show their ethnic roots don\u2019t run too deep.</p> <p>Which is all to say that this week Donald Trump finds himself in broad, though unfortunate, company. On Tuesday, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/20/us/politics/trump-jewish-voters.html?rref=collection%2Fbyline%2Fjulie-hirschfeld-davis&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=undefined&amp;region=stream&amp;module=stream_unit&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=1&amp;pgtype=collection\">the president said</a> that any Jewish person who votes for a Democrat is guilty of \u201cgreat disloyalty\u201d. Then Trump repeated his smears against the congresswomen Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib, following his impassioned demand last week that the Israeli government block their entry to the country due to their support of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement.</p> <p>\u201cWhere has the Democratic Party gone?\u201d Trump said. \u201cWhere have they gone where they are defending these two people over the state of Israel? And I think any Jewish people that vote for a Democrat, I think it shows either a total lack of knowledge or great disloyalty.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s latest statement, laced with centuries of antisemitic tropes, is no surprise for a president who has fraternized with avowed white nationalists and blamed white supremacist violence on \u201cmental health\u201d. Still, Trump\u2019s rhetorical gymnastics would be impressive if it weren\u2019t so threatening \u2013 he manages to weaponize Zionism, dogwhistle antisemitism and land on his feet, calling himself \u201c<a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/like-the-king-of-israel-trump-unleashes-bizarre-twitter-storm-1.7728867\">the king of Israel</a>\u201d. He\u2019d haul home all the medals if bigotry were an Olympic sport.</p> <p>American Jewish communal leaders should condemn the president\u2019s \u201cdisloyalty\u201d charges in no uncertain terms, regardless of their partisan leanings. Already Jonathan Greenblatt, chief executive of the Anti-Defamation League, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JGreenblattADL/status/1163927157707554816\">tweeted</a> his reproach and Logan Bayroff, communications director for J Street, called Trump\u2019s statement \u201cdangerous and shameful\u201d. \u201cIt is no surprise that the president\u2019s racist, disingenuous attacks on progressive women of color in Congress have now transitioned into smears against Jews,\u201d Bayroff <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Bayroff/status/1163968480795922432\">said</a>.</p> <p>In condemning the president\u2019s most recent remarks, Jewish leaders need to recognize how this moment fits into the president\u2019s larger prejudiced agenda.

      "bodyText": "It was January in Paris \u2013 cold, gray \u2013 when a ceremony held on the Champ-de-Mars roiled the city\u2019s elite. Military officials and civilians gathered to watch as a young Jewish artillery officer was punished for his alleged treason. Days earlier Alfred Dreyfus had been convicted of passing secrets to the Germans in a rushed court-martial. A French army officer stripped his insignia medals, took his sword and broke it over his knee. Dreyfus was marched around the courtyard of the \u00c9cole Militaire as crowds jeered and spat. Cries of \u201cJew!\u201d and \u201cJudas!\u201d drowned out his muffled professions of loyalty to the French state. The scene was striking \u2013 in the shadow of the newly built Eiffel Tower, a symbol of modernity, an almost primal witch-hunt unfolded. A once decorated army servant pleaded for pity as his neighbors called out \u201cdeath to the Jew\u201d. Dreyfus was exonerated two years later. The message of his trial was clear: even in a cosmopolitan city, in a country whose revolutionary myth called for liberty and equality, leaders could baselessly point their people\u2019s animus toward the other in their midst. There\u2019s a sordid history to charges of Jewish dual loyalty in the US In the early years of the second world war, isolationists opposed to American involvement dismissed the war as little more than a \u201cJewish cause\u201d. Charles Lindbergh berated Jewish leaders for \u201cagitating for war\u201d. Decades later, when the US senator Joe Lieberman ran on the Democratic ticket for vice-president, pundits questioned whether he was more loyal to Israel than to the US. During the democratic primaries in 2015, the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders was challenged on his \u201cdual citizenship\u201d with Israel. The larger question animating these statements is clear: when push comes to shove, will you disavow your differences? As many writers and thinkers have shown, white American political leaders have spent much of the country\u2019s history \u2013 from slavery, to Jim Crow, to the disenfranchised carceral state \u2013 attempting to construct an American patriotism whose core tenet is whiteness. That is a project white Jews can fit into, so long as they show their ethnic roots don\u2019t run too deep. Which is all to say that this week Donald Trump finds himself in broad, though unfortunate, company. On Tuesday, the president said that any Jewish person who votes for a Democrat is guilty of \u201cgreat disloyalty\u201d. Then Trump repeated his smears against the congresswomen Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib, following his impassioned demand last week that the Israeli government block their entry to the country due to their support of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement. \u201cWhere has the Democratic Party gone?\u201d Trump said. \u201cWhere have they gone where they are defending these two people over the state of Israel? And I think any Jewish people that vote for a Democrat, I think it shows either a total lack of knowledge or great disloyalty.\u201d Trump\u2019s latest statement, laced with centuries of antisemitic tropes, is no surprise for a president who has fraternized with avowed white nationalists and blamed white supremacist violence on \u201cmental health\u201d. Still, Trump\u2019s rhetorical gymnastics would be impressive if it weren\u2019t so threatening \u2013 he manages to weaponize Zionism, dogwhistle antisemitism and land on his feet, calling himself \u201cthe king of Israel\u201d. He\u2019d haul home all the medals if bigotry were an Olympic sport. American Jewish communal leaders should condemn the president\u2019s \u201cdisloyalty\u201d charges in no uncertain terms, regardless of their partisan leanings. Already Jonathan Greenblatt, chief executive of the Anti-Defamation League, tweeted his reproach and Logan Bayroff, communications director for J Street, called Trump\u2019s statement \u201cdangerous and shameful\u201d. \u201cIt is no surprise that the president\u2019s racist, disingenuous attacks on progressive women of color in Congress have now transitioned into smears against Jews,\u201d Bayroff said. In condemning the president\u2019s most recent remarks, Jewish leaders need to recognize how this moment fits into the president\u2019s larger prejudiced agenda. Combatting antisemitism when it appears isn\u2019t just an act of defense for the Jews; it is an essential part of the larger struggle to end white nationalism in all its forms. This is the argument that Eric K Ward, director of the Western States Center, makes skillfully in his essaySkin in the Game.

It is thought of as a single invasive force, but may affect memory, behaviour, sense of location or speech. Because of fear of the present and the future, many try to hide its development from partners, outsiders and indeed themselves.

But, as any restaurant chef or resourceful home cook will tell you, your icebox is your best friend. Used well, it will sort out pretty much any culinary predicament: dessert options for unexpected guests, lunchbox treats for last-minute outings, emergency dinners for impatient toddlers. All it takes is a little prep and some good ideas. Here are a few to get you going.</p> <h2><strong>Fresh orange sorbet</strong></h2> <p><em><strong>Maz Demir, executive chef at the <a href=\"https://skewdkitchen.com\" title=\"\">Turkish restaurant Skewd Kitchen in London</a></strong></em></p> <p>Slice the tops off two medium oranges and scoop out the flesh, taking care not to break the skin. Blitz the flesh in a blender, then sieve to obtain the juice. Mix in 2 tbsp honey, then pour into a freezer box and place in the freezer, along with the empty orange skin cups. After 24 hours, break up the sorbet with a fork to obtain a smooth texture. When ready to eat, fill the orange cups with sorbet and garnish with fresh mint.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c08fcec1e43eb71b06ad6a09c9d5e2b00c7c15e8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c08fcec1e43eb71b06ad6a09c9d5e2b00c7c15e8/0_56_5124_3074/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tofu steaks.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tofu steaks.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Oksana Bratanova/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Tofu steaks</strong></h2> <p><em><strong>Masaki Sugisaki, executive chef at the <a href=\"https://dinings.co.uk\" title=\"\">Japanese restaurant Dinings in London</a></strong></em></p> <p>Freezing, then defrosting firm tofu over a sieve is a great trick for draining it of its water (instead of weighting it down to press the water out), thereby creating an excellent meat-like texture. Once defrosted, slice into thick slabs and fry, glazing with teriyaki sauce; or mince and use as you would minced meat. Try mixing 300g with 200g onion and 50g shiitake mushrooms (both chopped and fried), 50g panko breadcrumbs, a little soy milk and some flour to bind, and shape into patties. In a saucepan, bring to the boil 360ml mirin, 280ml soy sauce, 200g sugar, 1 tbsp gochujang, 1 tbsp minced ginger and 1-2 minced garlic cloves, thicken with cornflour, and drizzle over the patties.</p> <h2><strong>Frozen grapes</strong></h2> <p><em><strong>Tom Kitchin, chef patron of <a href=\"https://thekitchin.com\" title=\"\">Michelin-starred restaurant The Kitchin, Edinburgh</a></strong></em></p> <p>Freeze the loose grapes that fall off the bunch and use as healthy sweet snacks \u2013 mini sorbets, if you will.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cef5c036cc472c0a49893735db8db080e51f0537\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cef5c036cc472c0a49893735db8db080e51f0537/0_0_3350_5025/667.jpg\" alt=\"Kimchi gyoza.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kimchi gyoza.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: MIXA/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Victoria plum froyo lollies</strong></h2> <p><em><strong>Sam Pearman, executive chef of The Talbot</strong></em><em><strong>, in Malton, Yorkshire, and the Swan</strong></em><em><strong>, in Ascott-under-Wychwood in the Cotswolds</strong></em></p> <p>Place 100g halved and stoned victoria plums in a large saucepan with 250g sugar, one cinnamon stick, one star anise and 150ml water. Simmer for 8-10 minutes. Remove the plums and stir gently until the liquid thickens, then pour over the plums and set aside to cool. Place 50g of the cooled compote in a blender with 100g sugar, 100ml plain yoghurt and a splash of water. Blitz until smooth, then pour into six lolly moulds and freeze. Freeze the rest of the compote in individual servings to use as a topping for yoghurt, ice-cream or porridge.</p> <h2><strong>Pizza pinwheels</strong></h2> <p><em><strong>Food blogger Mandy Mazliah, <a href=\"http://sneakyveg.com\" title=\"\">sneakyveg.com</a> </strong></em></p> <p>Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/400F/gas mark 6. Line a baking tray with a sheet of baking paper. Roll out a sheet of puff pastry and spread over 100g tomato sauce (I make a sneaky veg version blitzing a tin of chopped tomatoes with some garlic and olive oil-roasted veg: courgette, onion, squash, aubergine). Sprinkle with 50g grated cheese and 1 tsp dried oregano, then roll up along the long side. Slice into 12 segments then bake, flat, for 15 to 20 minutes, until golden. Allow to cool then freeze individually. Great for packed lunches: a frozen one placed in a lunchbox in the morning will be defrosted by midday.</p> <h2><strong>Cottage cheese and onion potato skins</strong></h2> <p><em><strong>Food writer and broadcaster Nadiya Hussain</strong></em></p> <p>Heat the oven to 220C/200C fan/425F/gas mark 7. Scrub eight medium potatoes clean then prick them with a fork (so they don\u2019t explode), lay them flat and microwave for 10 minutes. Turn them over and microwave for another 10 minutes. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, mix one finely chopped red onion, 1 tsp garlic paste, 300g full-fat cottage cheese, \u00bd tsp paprika and \u00bd tsp salt. Place the cooked potatoes on to two large baking trays, drizzle with oil and sprinkle generously with salt, then slice them in half lengthways. Taking care not to pierce the skins, scoop the flesh into the bowl holding the onion mixture. Combine, then spoon back to fill the skins. Drizzle with sriracha and sprinkle with 100g red leicester cheese, fresh or frozen (I always have some in the freezer). Bake for 20 minutes, until the cheese is bubbling and golden. Set aside as many as you need for dinner, serving sprinkled with chopped spring onions, and freeze the rest uncovered until firm, then wrap them individually in foil and put back in the freezer to be used one by one.</p> <p><em>Nadiya Hussain\u2019s Time to Eat</em><em> (Michael Joseph) is out now.</em></p> <h2><strong>Kimchi gyoza</strong></h2> <p><em><strong>Ollie Templeton, head chef and co-owner of the <a href=\"http://www.carousel-london.com/\" title=\"\">London restaurant Carousel</a></strong></em></p> <p>Gyoza pastry wrappers from an Asian supermarket usually come in packs of 50, so prepping them all in advance and freezing avoids waste and ensures you have a ready-to-cook batch to hand. Squeeze the juice out of 200g kimchi into a small bowl and set aside. Mix the kimchi with 200g diced and sauteed potatoes in another bowl. To fill, lay one wrapper on the palm of your hand, place a teaspoon of filling in its centre and wet the edge with your finger. Fold in half over the filling and pinch in the middle, then pleat the top layer at regular intervals and press on to the back layer to seal. Freeze in small batches. To eat, fry from frozen in vegetable oil over medium heat. Serve immediately, dipping into soy sauce mixed with lemon juice.</p> <h2><strong>Vegan salted caramel and pecan pie</strong></h2> <p><em><strong>Food blogger and <a href=\"https://www.rebelrecipes.com/\" title=\"\">cookbook author Niki Webster</a></strong></em></p> <p>Blitz 100g pecans in a food processor or high-speed blender, then add 40g ground almonds, 2 tbsp flaxseeds, 2 tbsp nut butter, 2 tbsp raw cacao and 8 pitted medjool dates, and blitz until everything comes together. Press into a 20cm loose-bottomed cake or tart tin with your hands, then put into the freezer. Wash out your food processor (or blender) and add in 150g pitted medjool dates, 2 tbsp nut butter, 125ml plant-based milk, 2 tbsp coconut oil and 1 tsp salt. Blitz for a few minutes, until smooth and creamy. Dollop on to the pie base and smooth out, then return to the freezer for at least one hour. Toast 150g pecans in a dry pan over a medium heat for a few minutes, until lightly coloured, then place in a concentric circle pattern over the pie to decorate. Sprinkle with flaky sea salt and store in the freezer. To serve, remove the pie 30\u201345 minutes before eating, to sit at room temperature.</p> <p><em>Rebel Recipes by Niki Webster is published by Bloomsbury in December</em></p> <h2><strong>Feta borek with courgettes </strong><strong>and walnuts</strong></h2> <p><em><strong>Colin Clague, executive chef at Anatolian restaurant R\u00fcya in London</strong></em></p> <p>Cut eight sheets of filo pastry into 15x18cm rectangles. In a bowl, shred any leftover pastry and mix with a chopped handful of flat-leaf parsley, some chopped dill, one grated medium carrot, 120g grated courgette, 300g crumbled feta and four egg yolks. Mix well to combine. Place 1-2 spoonfuls of feta mixture towards the bottom of a rectangle, finely grate over some walnuts, then fold over the edges, brush with egg wash and roll tightly. Freeze in individual servings (four per person). To use, fry from frozen in oil until golden brown and crunchy. Scatter with grated frozen feta and fresh herbs to serve.</p> <h2><strong>Perfect pie pastry, and a perfect fruit pie</strong></h2> <p><em><strong>Jacob Kenedy, chef patron of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jacob-kenedy\" title=\"\">Plaquemine Lock, Gelupo and Bocca di Lupo</a></strong></em></p> <p>The pastry ratio to follow is four parts butter to five parts flour and two parts ice water. For the perfect pie, cut 240g butter into 300g flour (with a pinch of salt), then add 120ml ice water and bring into a dough \u2013 do not overmix. Either freeze now, or make the pie to freeze and cook later: roll out half the dough and press into a pie case. Fill with 1kg of fruit (fresh or frozen \u2013 diced apples, peaches or pears, halved apricots, whole blackberries, blueberries \u2026) tossed with 150g sugar, 40g cornflour, 40ml lemon juice and \u00bd tsp cinnamon. Roll out the other half to cover the filling with a lattice, glaze with egg yolk and sprinkle with coarse sugar and freeze. When needed, bake for 20 minutes at 200C/180C fan/400F/gas mark 6 followed by 40 minutes at 170C/150C fan/325F/gas mark 3, then leave to cool before serving in thick slices.</p> <h2>Pesto</h2> <p><em><strong>Theo Randall, chef patron of Theo Randall at the InterContinental</strong></em></p> <p>Crush \u00bd garlic clove, peeled, with a pinch of sea salt with a mortar and pestle, or on a chopping board using a spoon to form a soft paste. Transfer to a food processor and add 120g of basil leaves, 3 tbsp pine nuts, 3 tbsp freshly grated parmesan cheese and 2 tbsp water. Blitz to obtain a smooth paste, then add 240ml olive oil and pulse for two seconds. Season to taste with sea salt and freshly ground black pepper. Put it in small sealed bags or containers to freeze, thus preserving the colour and flavour.</p> <h2><strong>Honey ice-cream</strong></h2> <p><em><strong>Tom Barnes, executive chef of L\u2019Enclume and Rogan &amp; Co in Cartmel, Cumbria</strong></em></p> <p>Mix 75g sugar with 120g egg yolk in a saucepan. Bring 500ml whole milk and 100ml double cream to the boil, then pour over the egg and sugar and cook on a low heat until the mix coats the back of a spoon. Add in 300g blossom honey and stir. Pour into small tubs and, when cooled, freeze. To serve, cook 200g mixed berries with 20g sugar and pour over bowlfuls of the ice-cream, garnishing with fresh lemon thyme and a drizzle of olive oil. Add a scattering of granola, if you like, for extra crunch.</p>",

That is: students go to university the year after their A-levels. This means they know their grades and have time to think about their possible course and preferred college. Depending on their circumstances they may work, carry out further study, travel. Whatever they do, the advantage to them and their future lecturers is that they have gained a year\u2019s maturity after the break. Some who may have been reluctant anyway will certainly decide not to take up the option of university, but better that this is a choice rather than dropping out after a miserable first year feeling a failure. It should certainly stop some of them regarding university as a continuation of boarding school. Mature students are usually highly motivated; likewise students who choose university after a year\u2019s break are likely to be confident they actually want to be there, rather than having done what is expected of them.<br><strong>Angela Barton</strong><br><em>Bishop\u2019s Stortford, Hertfordshire</em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Read more Guardian letters \u2013 click here to visit </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/letters\" title=\"\"><strong><em>gu.com/letters</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Do you have a photo you\u2019d like to share with Guardian readers? </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jan/15/share-your-best-photographs-of-the-week-with-us\" title=\"\"><strong><em>Click here</em></strong></a><strong><em> to upload it and we\u2019ll publish the best submissions in the letters spread of our print edition</em></strong></p>",

      "bodyText": "An obvious answer to the problem of predicted grades (Editorial, 17 August) has been raised before but does not seem to be seriously considered. That is: students go to university the year after their A-levels. This means they know their grades and have time to think about their possible course and preferred college. Depending on their circumstances they may work, carry out further study, travel. Whatever they do, the advantage to them and their future lecturers is that they have gained a year\u2019s maturity after the break. Some who may have been reluctant anyway will certainly decide not to take up the option of university, but better that this is a choice rather than dropping out after a miserable first year feeling a failure. It should certainly stop some of them regarding university as a continuation of boarding school. Mature students are usually highly motivated; likewise students who choose university after a year\u2019s break are likely to be confident they actually want to be there, rather than having done what is expected of them.

      "bodyText": "One thousand, eight hundred and sixty days after Eric Garner was killed on the streets of Staten Island, New York, his family finally received a sliver of justice. On Monday, the New York police department (NYPD) commissioner, James O\u2019Neill, announced the NYPD would fire Daniel Pantaleo, who, on that hot summer\u2019s day in July 2014, placed the unarmed 43-year-old in a banned chokehold that contributed to Garner\u2019s death. The decision follows years of protest, stalled investigations and secrecy in a case that came to embody the fractured relations between communities of color and police not just in New York City but around the US. And Pantaleo\u2019s firing, the Garner family insists, should be only the beginning of the process. The family has long demanded that in addition to Pantaleo, several other officers involved in Garner\u2019s arrest should be punished for their roles in the incident. \u201cWe\u2019re not finished. We have other officers that we have to go after,\u201d Garner\u2019s mother, Gwen Carr, said at a rally outside NYPD headquarters in lower Manhattan on Monday. \u201cYou have heard the names.

Do the roll call, because they all need to lose their jobs.\u201d But even after the announcement of Pantaleo\u2019s dismissal on Monday, the fates of the other officers remain largely opaque, as NYPD internal disciplinary procedures remain shrouded in secrecy. And there is little to suggest that any will face a similar process. Pantaleo was fired following an administrative trial brought by the CCRB, the city\u2019s independent police review board, in a process overseen by an NYPD trial judge. The judge, Rosemarie Maldonado, said in a secret judgment to O\u2019Neill thatthe chokehold \u201cfell so far short of objective reasonableness that this tribunal found it to be reckless \u2013 a gross deviation from the standard of conduct established for a New York City police officer\u201d.

Although Pantaleo did not testify during the trial, he was interviewed by NYPD internal affairs in the aftermath of the incident and argued, even after watching the eyewitness video of Garner\u2019s death, that he had not used a chokehold maneuver at all. Maldonado made clear in her judgment that Pantaleo\u2019s answer was \u201cuntruthful\u201d and \u201cself-serving\u201d. But other officers involved did testify as defendant witnesses, and Maldonado found elements of some their testimony problematic. It is these six men, and one female sergeant, the Garner family wants dismissed. The two senior officers, Lt Christopher Bannon and Sgt Dhanan Saminath, were not present during the physical altercation that led to Garner\u2019s death. But the patrol officers Mark Ramos, Craig Furlani, Justin Damico and William Meems were all involved in the apprehension. Each of the four officers testified they had not seen the positioning of Pantaleo\u2019s arms during the arrest. Maldonado\u2019s judgment describes this testimony as \u201cunhelpful or unreliable\u201d, noting: \u201cThe more central the factual inquiry [from prosecutors] was, the more vague recollections became.\u201d But the document does not make a determination on whether any of the four should face discipline. These are not the only concerns the Garner family has over the conduct of this group of six officers during the incident. Bannon, the commanding officer who initiated Garner\u2019s arrest after observing a group of people he believed to be involved in the sale of untaxed cigarettes on his way to a meeting that morning, told Saminath via text that Garner\u2019s death was \u201cnot a big deal\u201d after being informed of it. After Garner\u2019s death, Damico, Pantaleo\u2019s partner that day,processed Garner\u2019s arrest on an inflated felony, suggesting Garner had been found with 10,000 untaxed cigarettes even though officers recovered just two packets on his body. It is not clear if either of these incidents could or would be investigated as misconduct. When asked about this finding at a press conference on Monday, O\u2019Neill, the commissioner, intimated that none of the four officers would be subject to internal charges as a result, pointing out that the NYPD\u2019s internal affairs office had already examined them. \u201cThis whole situation transpired in seconds,\u201d O\u2019Neill said. \u201cAnd if they could recount step-for-step what they did, I think that would be nothing short of a miracle.\u201d The NYPD did not answer a request for further clarification, and referred the Guardan to O\u2019Neill\u2019s comments. The CCRB, which has the power to bring a case if a complaint is filed by a member of the public, did not respond to a request for comment. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot that clearly that went wrong in the situation that led to Eric Garner\u2019s killing. And it wasn\u2019t just Officer Pantaleo. There is potential misconduct from any number of officers which should be investigated and, if warranted, pursued through disciplinary proceedings,\u201d said Michael Sisitzky, lead policy counsel at the New York Civil Liberties Union. The NYPD has, however, leveled disciplinary charges against Kizzy Adonis, who was the supervisory sergeant present in the immediate aftermath of Garner\u2019s arrest. Adonis faced four counts of \u201cfailure to supervise\u201d, according to reports. The reports say the sergeant told internal investigators she observed that Garner, who had said \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d 11 times during the apprehension, did not seem in a serious condition and that \u201che did not appear to get worse\u201d. The NYPD did not initially provide further clarification on Adonis\u2019s trial beyond O\u2019Neill\u2019s comments.

      "body": "<h2>ON THE BRINK</h2> <p>It\u2019s been an eventful start to the season for Bury, despite nothing much happening around the club at all. Unbeaten in their first four league games due in no small part to the fact that they haven\u2019t been allowed or able to play any of them, the Shakers will extend that run to five against Tranmere Rovers on Saturday now it\u2019s been announced that particular fixture has become the latest to be postponed. Sadly, by then the club may well have gone the way of the dinosaurs, the dodo and the woolly mammoth, forced into extinction by their owner, Steve Dale, who has until Friday to provide evidence he has enough money in the kitty to keep the club above water <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/20/bury-brink-expulsion-fifth-league-match-suspended\">or else get cast out of the Football League</a>.</p> <p>\u201cFurther clarity remains outstanding in relation to a number of the club\u2019s financial obligations,\u201d droned a statement from the Football League, whose rules to protect clubs\u2019 viability has been highlighted by this whole sorry saga. \u201cThe EFL board continues to be frustrated at the lack of significant progress that has been made by Mr Dale in providing the information required.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/20/bury-brink-expulsion-fifth-league-match-suspended\">Bury on the brink of expulsion after fifth League One match is suspended</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As consistently vocal in his proclamations that EVERYTHING WILL BE OK as he seems consistently reluctant to prove it despite much bluster to the contrary, Dale has pulled off the commendable feat of further enraging Bury\u2019s fans, not to mention an ever-dwindling squad of unpaid senior players numbered at less than 11, by refusing the latest offer for the club. Reportedly made by Norman Smurthwaite, the controversial former Port Vale chairman, it was less than ideal but would at least have secured the Shakers\u2019 survival.</p> <p>In despair at the fate that looks set to befall her club, former Bury director Joy Hart has launched a lonely one-woman protest by handcuffing herself to a drainpipe outside the club. \u201cMr Steve Dale, you bought this club for \u00a31, sell it please,\u201d implored the daughter of former club legend Les Hart, after whom Gigg Lane\u2019s south stand is named. \u201cBury as a town and as a club will die on Friday if you do not.\u201d With the club\u2019s main stand named after their late father, also a former director, there are a couple of former England internationals who might also considering getting involved. If the sight of Phil and Gary Neville holding placards reading \u201cCareful Now!\u201d and \u201cDown With This Sort Of Thing!\u201d doesn\u2019t force prospective new buyers to dig deep, then surely nothing will.</p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> <p>\u201cThe club has investigated this situation and is more than satisfied there was no hygiene issue. The items should not have been stored here and have now been removed\u201d \u2013 a Dundee statement sniffs its response in the wake of a large bed frame and bin bags being spotted on the roof of a Dens Park food kiosk at Sunday\u2019s Skol Lager Cup game against Aberdeen.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fa95e2290b0f384719f78ed5130f50b017a14122\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa95e2290b0f384719f78ed5130f50b017a14122/0_0_4064_2704/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Some football scran, earlier.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Some football scran, earlier.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Sillitoe/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>FIVER LETTERS</h2> <p>\u201cLike Dan Webb (yesterday\u2019s Fiver letters), my dearly departed dad and I used to have a competition where we\u2019d guess who wrote the day\u2019s Fiver. I still do it, though worryingly I\u2019m probably still about 50 behind him \u2013 even more if he\u2019s managing to read The Fiver somewhere in the afterlife. He\u2019ll be very smug if there\u2019s a celestial version of The Fiver that actually contains the TV and radio listings\u201d \u2013 Bettina Vine.</p> <p>\u201cI second Dan\u2019s recommendation to make The Fiver a little more interesting by \u2018scroll(ing) past the name of that day\u2019s author\u2019, but wholeheartedly disagree with the part where he recommends to \u2018start reading the first article\u2019. The best way to enjoy The Fiver is to scroll past the author and just keep mashing that down arrow all the way to the bottom\u201d \u2013 Kris Nordstrom.</p> <p>\u201cI hope Pep Guardiola never experiences what poor Dan experienced in yesterday\u2019s Fiver letters and writes in, wins the prizeless letter o\u2019the day, and then doesn\u2019t receive the previously announced reward. I fear for him if yet another triumph slips from his grasp due to an entirely opaque and misunderstood last-second decision\u201d \u2013 Seth King.</p> <p>\u201cHaving been ranked at 1,057th twice in last season\u2019s Fantasy Premier League \u20181,057 Pedants\u2019, imagine my surprise to find there are only 950 pedants registered this year.

Unbeaten in their first four league games due in no small part to the fact that they haven\u2019t been allowed or able to play any of them, the Shakers will extend that run to five against Tranmere Rovers on Saturday now it\u2019s been announced that particular fixture has become the latest to be postponed. Sadly, by then the club may well have gone the way of the dinosaurs, the dodo and the woolly mammoth, forced into extinction by their owner, Steve Dale, who has until Friday to provide evidence he has enough money in the kitty to keep the club above water or else get cast out of the Football League. \u201cFurther clarity remains outstanding in relation to a number of the club\u2019s financial obligations,\u201d droned a statement from the Football League, whose rules to protect clubs\u2019 viability has been highlighted by this whole sorry saga. \u201cThe EFL board continues to be frustrated at the lack of significant progress that has been made by Mr Dale in providing the information required.\u201d As consistently vocal in his proclamations that EVERYTHING WILL BE OK as he seems consistently reluctant to prove it despite much bluster to the contrary, Dale has pulled off the commendable feat of further enraging Bury\u2019s fans, not to mention an ever-dwindling squad of unpaid senior players numbered at less than 11, by refusing the latest offer for the club. Reportedly made by Norman Smurthwaite, the controversial former Port Vale chairman, it was less than ideal but would at least have secured the Shakers\u2019 survival. In despair at the fate that looks set to befall her club, former Bury director Joy Hart has launched a lonely one-woman protest by handcuffing herself to a drainpipe outside the club. \u201cMr Steve Dale, you bought this club for \u00a31, sell it please,\u201d implored the daughter of former club legend Les Hart, after whom Gigg Lane\u2019s south stand is named. \u201cBury as a town and as a club will die on Friday if you do not.\u201d With the club\u2019s main stand named after their late father, also a former director, there are a couple of former England internationals who might also considering getting involved. If the sight of Phil and Gary Neville holding placards reading \u201cCareful Now!\u201d and \u201cDown With This Sort Of Thing!\u201d doesn\u2019t force prospective new buyers to dig deep, then surely nothing will. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cThe club has investigated this situation and is more than satisfied there was no hygiene issue. The items should not have been stored here and have now been removed\u201d \u2013 a Dundee statement sniffs its response in the wake of a large bed frame and bin bags being spotted on the roof of a Dens Park food kiosk at Sunday\u2019s Skol Lager Cup game against Aberdeen. FIVER LETTERS \u201cLike Dan Webb (yesterday\u2019s Fiver letters), my dearly departed dad and I used to have a competition where we\u2019d guess who wrote the day\u2019s Fiver. I still do it, though worryingly I\u2019m probably still about 50 behind him \u2013 even more if he\u2019s managing to read The Fiver somewhere in the afterlife. He\u2019ll be very smug if there\u2019s a celestial version of The Fiver that actually contains the TV and radio listings\u201d \u2013 Bettina Vine. \u201cI second Dan\u2019s recommendation to make The Fiver a little more interesting by \u2018scroll(ing) past the name of that day\u2019s author\u2019, but wholeheartedly disagree with the part where he recommends to \u2018start reading the first article\u2019. The best way to enjoy The Fiver is to scroll past the author and just keep mashing that down arrow all the way to the bottom\u201d \u2013 Kris Nordstrom. \u201cI hope Pep Guardiola never experiences what poor Dan experienced in yesterday\u2019s Fiver letters and writes in, wins the prizeless letter o\u2019the day, and then doesn\u2019t receive the previously announced reward. I fear for him if yet another triumph slips from his grasp due to an entirely opaque and misunderstood last-second decision\u201d \u2013 Seth King. \u201cHaving been ranked at 1,057th twice in last season\u2019s Fantasy Premier League \u20181,057 Pedants\u2019, imagine my surprise to find there are only 950 pedants registered this year. It looks like STOP FOOTBALL is working\u201d \u2013 Haydn Pyatt. Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. And you can always tweet The Fiver via @guardian_sport. Today\u2019s winner of our prizeless letter o\u2019the day is \u2026 Bettina Vine. NEWS, BITS AND BOBS Aston Villa youth coach Kevin MacDonald has left the club after an investigation into allegations of bullying made by a number of former young players. Manchester United and Kick It Out will meet representatives of Social Media Disgrace Twitter regarding concerns over racism and other abuse aimed at footballers. Ian Holloway is trying to clarify earlier comments which suggested he held the EU responsible for the new handball rules. \u201cI\u2019m not that stupid,\u201d he fumed. \u201cFifa and Uefa have brought these rules in, they told us we\u2019ve got to use VAR. That I\u2019ve got no problem with, but that handball rule that they\u2019ve made up, that\u2019s nonsensical. It\u2019s just the same way I\u2019m sick and fed up of us in the UK being told what to do by the EU.\u201d Franck Rib\u00e9ry has rocked up in Tuscany and signed for Fiorentina after a snub for TripAdvisor. \u201c[Luca Toni] told me it\u2019s a great club and a beautiful city,\u201d he roared. Wales manager Ryan Giggs has left captain Ashley Williams out of his squad for the Euro 2020 qualifier against Azerbaijan because he is still without a club, while Paul Dummett isn\u2019t in there either. \u201cI spoke to Paul and he just really wanted to concentrate on club football,\u201d sighed Giggs. \u201cI think that will be it. He wanted to make sure he was fit for Newcastle.\u201d Jonathan Woodgate is off the mark as Middlesbrough boss after a 1-0 Championship win over Wigan. \u201cI have said numerous times now, this is a work in progress and I have said to the fans, it is going to be a rocky road,\u201d he warned. Carli Lloyd: good at football. And Clyde manager Danny Lennon, 50 [actually 50 \u2013 Fiver Ed] may well be aching a bit after bringing himself off the bench in his side\u2019s 3-1 Glasgow Cup win over a Queen\u2019s Celtic colts team. \u201cI still have the physicality and the health to grace the pitch,\u201d he tooted. \u201cI felt that I handled it no problem \u2026 I\u2019m actually going to go and look and negotiate a contract in the mirror with myself.\u201d STILL WANT MORE? Already loving VAR? Wait until the Premier League finds a sponsor for it, cheers Marina Hyde. Which team had the first away following in football?

      "body": "<p>The shortlist for the biggest prize in live comedy, the Edinburgh Comedy award, has been announced \u2013 and it\u2019s one of the most diverse in the history of what used to be the Perrier. Straight standup, autobiographical shows, experimentalism and prop comedy are all recognised, alongside two sketch shows \u2013 representing a mini-revival for the artform. A year after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/aug/25/rose-matafeo-wins-edinburgh-best-comedy-show-award\">New Zealand\u2019s Rose Matafeo</a> became the first person of colour to win the main award as a solo performer, two strong black British comedians also feature.</p> <p>It\u2019s a shortlist (or not-so-shortlist, given the record-equalling tally of comics involved) that features old hands and first-timers. The convention-bending Jordan Brookes makes a second appearance after 2017\u2019s Body of Work, and his new, part-improvised offering <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/aug/17/jordan-brookes-review-pleasance-courtyard-edinburgh\">I\u2019ve Got Nothing</a> will be among the favourites. Goofball <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/dec/08/spencer-jones-waynes-world-had-big-influence-on-me\">Spencer Jones</a> \u2013 whose sitcom The Mind of Herbert Clunkerdunk recently broadcast on BBC2 \u2013 was also nominated two summers ago. Birmingham standup Darren Harriott \u2013 a best newcomer nominee in the same year \u2013 graduates to the main list.</p> <p>Sketch comedy is represented by the double acts Goodbear (Joe Barnes and Henry Perryment, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/aug/16/goodbear-dougal-review-pleasance-dome-edinburgh\">a show that pretends they\u2019ve not turned up</a>) and wildcards The Delightful Sausage (Chris Cantrill and Amy Gledhill), whose <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/aug/19/edinburgh-sketch-shows-roundup\">dark and daft hour</a> is set in a holiday camp. Australian Demi Lardner is another freewheeling surrealist, whose work has wooed awards panels at the Melbourne Comedy festival but not \u2013 until now \u2013 in Edinburgh.</p> <p>This year\u2019s winner is more likely to come from the straighter trio of Ivo Graham, Jessica Fostekew and London Hughes. Graham has been delivering <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/oct/18/ivo-graham-review-soho-theatre-london\" title=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/oct/18/ivo-graham-review-soho-theatre-london\">reliably funny sets</a> on his days at Eton and his awkward poshness for some years \u2013 but new show The Game of Life is reportedly a big step up. Hughes has a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/aug/10/london-hughes-review-pleasance-courtyard-edinburgh\">once-seen, never-forgotten show</a> about her sex life, To Catch a Dick, which showcases a personality that could illuminate Edinburgh\u2019s military tattoo single-handedly. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/aug/17/jessica-fostekew-review-monkey-barrel-comedy-edinburgh\">Fostekew\u2019s show about body image and being a muscular woman</a> is one of the buzziest in town, signalling an elevation to the big league for another act with more than a few fringes under her belt.</p> <p>The winner of the award will be announced on Saturday and presented with the prize by Matafeo and Stephen Fry \u2013 who won the first ever Perrier award with the Cambridge Footlights in 1981. Whoever triumphs (<a href=\"http://www.comedyawards.co.uk/best-comedy-show\">previous champs</a> include Frank Skinner, Bridget Christie and Nanette star Hannah Gadsby) will receive \u00a310,000 and the best newcomer \u00a35,000. The award is sponsored for the first time by the TV channel Dave, which also sponsors the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/aug/19/olaf-falafel-edinburgh-funniest-joke-award\">Funniest Joke of the Fringe prize</a>.</p> <p>The shortlist caps a comedy festival notable this year for its open field, with plenty of big-hitting shows, but fewer shoo-ins for the shortlist than in previous years. New York musical comic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/aug/20/catherine-cohen-edinburgh-star-millennial-comic-fringe\">Catherine Cohen</a> is its most conspicuous omission, joining a pantheon of terrific American acts (Doug Stanhope, Bo Burnham, Kate Berlant) sidelined by the award over the years. Her consolation is a slot on this year\u2019s best newcomer shortlist, which also includes Janine Harouni, Huge Davies, Helen Bauer, Michael Odewale, Crybabies, Nigel Ng and Sophie Duker.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The shortlist for the biggest prize in live comedy, the Edinburgh Comedy award, has been announced \u2013 and it\u2019s one of the most diverse in the history of what used to be the Perrier. Straight standup, autobiographical shows, experimentalism and prop comedy are all recognised, alongside two sketch shows \u2013 representing a mini-revival for the artform. A year after New Zealand\u2019s Rose Matafeo became the first person of colour to win the main award as a solo performer, two strong black British comedians also feature. It\u2019s a shortlist (or not-so-shortlist, given the record-equalling tally of comics involved) that features old hands and first-timers. The convention-bending Jordan Brookes makes a second appearance after 2017\u2019s Body of Work, and his new, part-improvised offering I\u2019ve Got Nothing will be among the favourites. Goofball Spencer Jones \u2013 whose sitcom The Mind of Herbert Clunkerdunk recently broadcast on BBC2 \u2013 was also nominated two summers ago. Birmingham standup Darren Harriott \u2013 a best newcomer nominee in the same year \u2013 graduates to the main list. Sketch comedy is represented by the double acts Goodbear (Joe Barnes and Henry Perryment, with a show that pretends they\u2019ve not turned up) and wildcards The Delightful Sausage (Chris Cantrill and Amy Gledhill), whose dark and daft hour is set in a holiday camp. Australian Demi Lardner is another freewheeling surrealist, whose work has wooed awards panels at the Melbourne Comedy festival but not \u2013 until now \u2013 in Edinburgh. This year\u2019s winner is more likely to come from the straighter trio of Ivo Graham, Jessica Fostekew and London Hughes. Graham has been delivering reliably funny sets on his days at Eton and his awkward poshness for some years \u2013 but new show The Game of Life is reportedly a big step up. Hughes has a once-seen, never-forgotten show about her sex life, To Catch a Dick, which showcases a personality that could illuminate Edinburgh\u2019s military tattoo single-handedly. Fostekew\u2019s show about body image and being a muscular woman is one of the buzziest in town, signalling an elevation to the big league for another act with more than a few fringes under her belt. The winner of the award will be announced on Saturday and presented with the prize by Matafeo and Stephen Fry \u2013 who won the first ever Perrier award with the Cambridge Footlights in 1981. Whoever triumphs (previous champs include Frank Skinner, Bridget Christie and Nanette star Hannah Gadsby) will receive \u00a310,000 and the best newcomer \u00a35,000. The award is sponsored for the first time by the TV channel Dave, which also sponsors the Funniest Joke of the Fringe prize. The shortlist caps a comedy festival notable this year for its open field, with plenty of big-hitting shows, but fewer shoo-ins for the shortlist than in previous years. New York musical comic Catherine Cohen is its most conspicuous omission, joining a pantheon of terrific American acts (Doug Stanhope, Bo Burnham, Kate Berlant) sidelined by the award over the years. Her consolation is a slot on this year\u2019s best newcomer shortlist, which also includes Janine Harouni, Huge Davies, Helen Bauer, Michael Odewale, Crybabies, Nigel Ng and Sophie Duker.",

It was reported in April that he had sold the property to HS2 for \u00a36.8m, a 202% price increase over the period.</p> <p>A property that appears to be Whatcroft Hall is listed for rent at \u00a310,000 a month <a href=\"https://www.rightmove.co.uk/property-to-rent/property-73131058.html\">on the Rightmove website</a>.</p> <p>The 202% rise far exceeds the average increase in property prices in the district where the property is located. According to Rightmove, the average property price in the area increased by 50% between January 2011 and September 2018, from \u00a3150,600 to \u00a3226,100.</p> <p>Homeowners who live in the path of the proposed route are entitled to compensation, and HS2 has said it aims to achieve a fair price for both homeowners and taxpayers.</p> <p>However, in April this year, BBC News reported that campaigners opposed to the rail project believed that some homeowners had been treated badly, and claimed that homes were routinely undervalued by HS2.</p> <p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whatcroft_Hall\">Whatcroft Hall</a>, which is reportedly within 150 metres of the proposed rail line, was <a href=\"https://www.zoopla.co.uk/property-history/whatcroft-hall/whatcroft-hall-lane/whatcroft/northwich/cw9-7sq/25249772\">described in a 2010 estate agent listing</a> as \u201ca<strong> </strong>truly exquisite Grade II* listed country house nestled in approximately 24 acres \u2026 [with] beautifully manicured landscaped gardens and grounds incorporating horseshoe shaped lake with central island, sweeping lawns, paddock land, woodland, hard tennis court and mooring on to canal\u201d.</p> <p>In April, a spokesman for Bishop told the BBCthat the comedian had refurbished the house and grounds during the years he owned the property. It is understood that Whatcroft Hall was previously a 10-bedroom home but now has five large bedrooms.</p> <p>The spokesman added: \u201cJohn Bishop maintains his opposition to HS2. He is unhappy, like many others affected by the proximity of the proposed line, that he was left with no choice but to sell his family home to HS2. The proposed line had rendered it unsellable on the open market \u2013 thus destroying all he and his family had worked for.\u201d</p> <p>It is thought that most of the huge portfolio of properties bought by the HS2 company are being rented out. </p> <p><strong>\u2022 Sign up to the daily Business Today email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/may/16/guardian-business-today-sign-up-financial-news-email?CMP=business_footnote\">here</a> or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BusinessDesk\">@BusinessDesk</a>.</strong></p>",

Bishop\u2019s Georgian-style country mansion in Cheshire was one of more than 900 residential properties, farms and tracts of land on the route that were bought by the company responsible for delivering the project between 2011 and 2018 for a total of almost \u00a3600m. It also bought a house in Camden, north London, owned by Stanley Johnson, father of the prime minister,for \u00a34.4m in March 2016, as part of a compensation scheme. Bishop bought Whatcroft Hall in Northwich, Cheshire, for \u00a32.25m in 2011. It was reported in April that he had sold the property to HS2 for \u00a36.8m, a 202% price increase over the period. A property that appears to be Whatcroft Hall is listed for rent at \u00a310,000 a month on the Rightmove website. The 202% rise far exceeds the average increase in property prices in the district where the property is located. According to Rightmove, the average property price in the area increased by 50% between January 2011 and September 2018, from \u00a3150,600 to \u00a3226,100. Homeowners who live in the path of the proposed route are entitled to compensation, and HS2 has said it aims to achieve a fair price for both homeowners and taxpayers. However, in April this year, BBC News reported that campaigners opposed to the rail project believed that some homeowners had been treated badly, and claimed that homes were routinely undervalued by HS2. Whatcroft Hall, which is reportedly within 150 metres of the proposed rail line, was described in a 2010 estate agent listing as \u201ca truly exquisite Grade II* listed country house nestled in approximately 24 acres \u2026 [with] beautifully manicured landscaped gardens and grounds incorporating horseshoe shaped lake with central island, sweeping lawns, paddock land, woodland, hard tennis court and mooring on to canal\u201d. In April, a spokesman for Bishop told the BBCthat the comedian had refurbished the house and grounds during the years he owned the property. It is understood that Whatcroft Hall was previously a 10-bedroom home but now has five large bedrooms. The spokesman added: \u201cJohn Bishop maintains his opposition to HS2. He is unhappy, like many others affected by the proximity of the proposed line, that he was left with no choice but to sell his family home to HS2. The proposed line had rendered it unsellable on the open market \u2013 thus destroying all he and his family had worked for.\u201d It is thought that most of the huge portfolio of properties bought by the HS2 company are being rented out. \u2022 Sign up to the daily Business Today email here or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk.",

      "bodyText": "Anti-abortion activists have lost a court of appeal challenge against a council\u2019s decision to ban protesters from gathering outside a clinic in west London. Judges on Wednesday dismissed an appeal against an earlier ruling that the restrictions imposed by Ealing council outside a Marie Stopes clinic were justified. The authority was the first in the UK to create a buffer zone in April 2018 after anti-abortion demonstrations. It imposed the public spaces protection order (PSPO) following reports of \u201cintimidation, harassment and distress\u201d for women using the facility in Mattock Lane. Alina Dulgheriu and Andrea Orthova, who attend vigils run by the Good Counsel Network (GCN), which seeks to dissuade women from having abortions, mounted a legal challenge at the court of appeal in an attempt to overturn the ban. Their lawyers argued that the ban interfered with their rights under the European convention on human rights to freedom of expression, freedom of religion or belief, and freedom of assembly and association. They also argued that the council was wrong to use a PSPO because the orders were designed to protect local residents from antisocial behaviour, and clinic users were \u201cone-off or occasional\u201d visitors to the area. The master of the rolls, Sir Terence Etherton, Lady Justice King and Lady Justice Nicola Davies unanimously dismissed their appeal on Wednesday, upholding an earlier decision in favour of Ealing by the high court. A lawyer representing the women said during an appeal hearing in July that many of the allegations made against protesters in evidence gathered by the council during a consultation exercise were strongly disputed by the women, GCN and other anti-abortion groups. Ealing council argued that some users of the clinic who had abortions many years ago were still \u201csignificantly affected by their encounters with the activists\u201d. The authority\u2019s QC said the council received a petition signed by more than 3,500 people urging it to take action. Julian Bell, the leader of the council, said: \u201cWe\u2019re delighted the court of appeal has decided to keep our safe zone in place to protect clinic users and local people from harassment and intimidation.

The government says it makes sense to \u201cunshackle\u201d officials from Brussels business, but to the Liberal Democrat MEP Lucy Nethsingha the decision sounds crazy. Elected in May this year, she intends to play her full role in the parliament. Nethsingha, a former special needs teacher, is one of a handful of British MEPs voted into leading roles on European parliament committees, which play a significant role in EU lawmaking.

      "body": "<p>Act III may bring some new protagonists. There are a few batsmen whose contributions have been akin to that of the second gravedigger in Hamlet. They are predominantly opening batsmen, with Rory Burns <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/aug/15/rory-burns-counts-his-blessings-amid-england-fragility-at-lords\" title=\"\">a glowing exception</a>.</p> \n<p>The Australian pair have failed to fire. There has been little chance for rabid English supporters to become hoarse while David Warner has been at the crease. He has accumulated 18 runs from 50 deliveries at an average of 4.50 per innings. Cameron Bancroft has hinted at greater permanency as he doggedly props forward and plays around his front pad but he has mustered 44 runs at 11.</p> \n<p>On the English side the one-day cavaliers have also struggled. At the top, Jason Roy has 40 runs at an average of 10; down below Jos Buttler has 49 at 12.25. Of these batsmen Buttler has looked the most secure and at Lord\u2019s his second\u2011innings 31 alongside Ben Stokes was critical. His strike rate in the series is an eyebrow-raising 29.51, which highlights an often delicious difference between one\u2011day international and Test cricket.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/21/australias-obsession-with-heroic-injuries-hampers-progress-on-concussion-in-sport\">Australia's fixation with heroic injuries hampers progress on concussion in sport | Megan Maurice</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Buttler, like Warner, has bridged the gap in the recent past. His overall record in this format is far from gobsmacking but respectable and there is scope to improve: he has 1,771 runs in 33 Tests at 34.05. But it is all new for Roy and somehow far more complicated than taking guard at the top of the order against a white ball.</p> \n<p>The technical reasons are clear. The white ball does not swing as much; Roy\u2019s role is to attack, to exploit the early gaps in the field and that suits him well; a few failures when playing an expansive game is an occupational hazard readily accepted. In ODI cricket the best place to bat is usually at the start of the innings. That rarely applies in Test cricket. Look at the struggles of Warner and Bancroft as well as England\u2019s desperate, recent searches to find someone to bat there. The best bowlers are fresh, the ball swings, the nicks carry and the slip cordon is well-populated.</p> \n<p>There is one other less tangible difference between playing Test and ODI cricket. A Test match takes so damn long, there is so much time to agonise \u2013 over a first-innings failure, a dropped catch \u2013 and there is so much scrutiny from the sages in their boxes. It all happens so rapidly in a one-day match, even if it is of 100 overs\u2019 duration. Succeed or fail but you do not have all that time to mull over the latest cock-up.

      "bodyText": "Act III may bring some new protagonists. There are a few batsmen whose contributions have been akin to that of the second gravedigger in Hamlet. They are predominantly opening batsmen, with Rory Burns a glowing exception. The Australian pair have failed to fire. There has been little chance for rabid English supporters to become hoarse while David Warner has been at the crease. He has accumulated 18 runs from 50 deliveries at an average of 4.50 per innings. Cameron Bancroft has hinted at greater permanency as he doggedly props forward and plays around his front pad but he has mustered 44 runs at 11. On the English side the one-day cavaliers have also struggled. At the top, Jason Roy has 40 runs at an average of 10; down below Jos Buttler has 49 at 12.25. Of these batsmen Buttler has looked the most secure and at Lord\u2019s his second\u2011innings 31 alongside Ben Stokes was critical. His strike rate in the series is an eyebrow-raising 29.51, which highlights an often delicious difference between one\u2011day international and Test cricket. Buttler, like Warner, has bridged the gap in the recent past. His overall record in this format is far from gobsmacking but respectable and there is scope to improve: he has 1,771 runs in 33 Tests at 34.05. But it is all new for Roy and somehow far more complicated than taking guard at the top of the order against a white ball. The technical reasons are clear. The white ball does not swing as much; Roy\u2019s role is to attack, to exploit the early gaps in the field and that suits him well; a few failures when playing an expansive game is an occupational hazard readily accepted. In ODI cricket the best place to bat is usually at the start of the innings. That rarely applies in Test cricket. Look at the struggles of Warner and Bancroft as well as England\u2019s desperate, recent searches to find someone to bat there. The best bowlers are fresh, the ball swings, the nicks carry and the slip cordon is well-populated. There is one other less tangible difference between playing Test and ODI cricket. A Test match takes so damn long, there is so much time to agonise \u2013 over a first-innings failure, a dropped catch \u2013 and there is so much scrutiny from the sages in their boxes. It all happens so rapidly in a one-day match, even if it is of 100 overs\u2019 duration. Succeed or fail but you do not have all that time to mull over the latest cock-up. In that sense white-ball cricket is a less demanding proposition. Especially for newcomers, a Test can be the most draining experience even if you bat for only half an hour and spend most of the time standing at second slip, which was Roy\u2019s lot at Lord\u2019s. Finally, on the fifth day, a chance comes along and it is dropped there and the replay is instantly visible on one of the big screens. You spend so much time waiting to atone in Test cricket. Roy is discovering the painful contrasts between the formats right now. Provided he passes another concussion test on Thursday morning, Roy has his chance to break the barrier, after which Test cricket can become a far more comfortable experience. The assumption is that he will be opening the batting again but, bizarrely, this is not an absolute certainty. It seems as if England have been fretting over their batting order for the past two years.

Other Temple chapters donate tampons to women\u2019s shelters (\u201cMenstruation for Satan!\u201d) and protest against anti-abortionists. Across the US, civic-minded millennial satanists combine activism with pranks calculated to wind up the Christian right. With her funny, light-hearted documentary, Penny Lane lets the sunshine in, focusing on the Temple\u2019s message of open-mindedness and inclusivity \u2013 LGBTQ followers speak of a sense of belonging. The reason for the question mark in the title is that Satanic Temple followers don\u2019t worship the devil. Most are atheists who skew to Milton\u2019s representation of the prince of darkness as a rebellious bad boy sticking it to authority. The \u201csatanist\u201d label is clever marketing \u2013 calculated to maximise shock value by the Temple\u2019s co-founder Lucien Greaves, a hoodie-wearing Harvard graduate who talks in corporate buzzwords like a frozen yoghurt entrepreneur. Much of Greaves\u2019s activism is directed at the separation of church and state, what he sees as the creep of Christian values into public life. When the government of Arkansas erects a monument to the Ten Commandments outside the state capitol, he applies to have a bronze statue of Baphomet put up next to it.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump has seized on Germany\u2019s historic debt auction as another weapon to beat the Fed with: However, the difference between US and German bond yields (and the fact the latter are negative) reflects growth prospects as well as interest rates, and the prospect of a fresh eurozone QE bond-buying programme. After a solid day\u2019s trading, the FTSE 100 index has closed 1% higher at 7,203, up 78 points. The pound is still down on the day at $1.214, a drop of 0.25%. David Madden of CMC Markets blames the \u201csame old Brexit worries\u201d Sterling gave some of the gains that were made yesterday, but it is still well above the lows of last week, so traders might be getting used to the idea of a no-deal Brexit seeing as it appears we are heading in that direction. Time for a quick recap The UK is on track to miss its borrowing targets this year, after another month of disappointing public finances. Britain only posted a surplus of \u00a31.3bn in July - typically a good month for tax receipts - as government spending rose faster than income. The City had expected a surplus of \u00a32.7bn, compared with \u00a33.3bn in July 2018. Economists believe the eventual deficit for the 2019-20 financial year will exceed the target, \u00a329.3bn, by billions of pounds. Germany has sold 30-year bonds with no interest repayments, for the first time ever. Demand for the zero-coupon bunds was weaker than hoped, though, with just \u20ac824m of the \u20ac2bn on offer being sold. Donald Trump has launched another assault on America\u2019s top central banker. He dubbed Jerome Powell \u2018a golfer who can\u2019t putt\u2019, placing more pressure on the Fed chair to lower interest rates. Trump also stirred the US-China trade war, claiming that Beijing had ripped America off for decades. The president suggested that short-term economic pain caused by the trade dispute was worth it. European stock markets have rallied, on hopes that a new Italian government can be formed. Italy\u2019s president Sergio Mattarella, has begun talks with political parties, in the hope of avoiding new elections in the autumn. The future of Britain\u2019s HS2 rail project is in doubt, after the government played a key critic on a new review of the plan\u2019s future. A decision on whether to abandon the project is expected by the end of the year. My colleague Severin Carrell has spotted that Scotland ran a deficit seven times higher than the UK as a whole last year, despite again cutting its overspend on public services. He writes: The latest Government Expenditure and Revenue Scotland (Gers) figures showed there was a record gap of nearly \u00a32,000 per person between how much was spent on public services and debt repayment, and total tax revenues for 2018/19. Scotland\u2019s notional deficit stood at \u00a312.6bn or 7% of GDP, including North Sea oil revenues, compared to the UK\u2019s total \u00a323.5bn deficit \u2013 which includes Scotland\u2019s figure, equivalent to 1.1% of UK GDP. Total state spending in Scotland was \u00a31,661 higher per person than the UK average at \u00a375.3bn, while tax receipts were \u00a3307 less per head than the UK average, at \u00a362.7bn. Excluding oil revenues, the deficit exceeded \u00a314bn, equal to 22.5% of tax revenues. More here: US retailer Target has lifted the New York stock market, by beating profit and revenue forecasts. Target grew earnings by 17% in the last quarter, as its in-store pickup and same-day shipping services proved popular. It also raised its outlook for the rest of the year, suggesting it\u2019s confident that US consumers will keep spending. Ding ding! Wall Street has opened higher: Dow Jones: up 217 points or 0.84% at 26,179 S&amp;P 500: up 24 points or 0.83% at 2,924 Nasdaq: up 73 points or 0.93% at 8,022. Back in Germany, a slowdown in machinery exports has reinforced fears that Europe\u2019s largest economy is heading into recession. Exports of German-made equipment shrank by 1.8% in the second quarter of 2019, according to the German Mechanical Engineering Industry Association (VDMA), having risen by 3.8% in January-March. VDMA chief economist Ralph Wiechers blamed problems overseas, saying: \u201cThe uncertainty triggered by the trade conflict between the United States and China in particular, as well as the lack of prospects for an agreement on Brexit, are hurting our export-focused sector.\u201d VDMA also reports that machinery exports to China have barely risen since the start of 2019. If this weakness continued, then it could drag Germany\u2019s GDP down in the current quarter - following a 0.1% contraction in Q2. Just in: President Trump is launching yet another attack on America\u2019s central bank for not cutting interest rates harder and faster. In a flurry of tweets, Trump begins by claims the media are trying to talk the US economy into a recession: Trump may be referring to coverage of the inverted US bond yield curve last week. I think the media were right to cover it, and to mention that it typically precedes a recession (although it quickly de-inverted....). Trump then compared Powell to a dodgy putter - quite an insult from the Golfer In Chief - for allowing US interest rates to rise too high. Technically, the German 30-year bond auction is a failure, as Berlin sold less than half of the debt on offer. On the other hand, if investors are paying for the privilege of lending to you, it\u2019s hardly a complete flop. Back in the financial markets, Germany has broken new ground by selling 30-year government debt with a zero coupon. That means Berlin would not pay any interest on the bonds, but simply return the money in 2049. The bonds aren\u2019t linked to inflation either, so anyone buying the bonds would surely suffer a real loss when the three decades was up. Germany has sold 10-year bund with a zero coupon before, but never a 30-year one. However, the historic sale is something of a flop -- German only raised \u20ac824m, having offered \u20ac2bn of new bonds to the market. But investors who took part in the auction actually paid MORE than the face value of the bonds. That means they will actually offer a yield of -0.11%, confirming that buyers will lose money on the trade. Unless they can sell the bunds onto someone else at an even higher price. Here\u2019s some snap reaction: A clarification to that earlier post: Ryanair\u2019s Irish pilots have been blocked from striking later this week. The budget airline is now seeking an injunction at the high court in London to prevent UK-based pilots walking out. Sorry for the confusion.... Today\u2019s borrowing figures are the first released since Sajid Javid replaced Philip Hammond at the Treasury nearly a month ago. They\u2019re a reminder of the challenge facing Britain\u2019s finance ministry, which already didn\u2019t expect to balance the books until the mid-2020s. The increase in this deficit this year is a \u201cheadache\u201d for the new chancellor, says Sky News\u2019s John-Paul Ford Rojas, as he tries to balance the books and help deliver Boris Johnson\u2019s spending pledges. Two important pieces of transport news: 1) The government has appointed a major critic of its High Speed 2 rail project to help lead a review into the project. Lord Berkeley, a railway expert and Labour peer, has been made deputy chair of the review - which will decide whether the scheme linking London to Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds should go ahead. He has repeatedly challenged the Department for Transport\u2019s cost figures and warned that the budgets were spiralling out of control -- which perhaps gives a hint about how the probe will pan out. More here: 2) The Dublin High Court has blocked a planned strike by Irish-based Ryanair pilots, which had been scheduled for Thursday and Friday  . The budget airline says flights from Ireland will now operate as normal - which must be a relief to passengers heading off on their summer hols. On the other hand, Britain\u2019s widening deficit might undermine the PM\u2019s efforts to boost spending. Richard Hughes, Macroeconomic Policy Unit Research Associate at the Resolution Foundation, explains: \u201cBorrowing was \u00a36 billion higher in the first four months of this year than the same period last year. The Office for Budget Responsibility had been expecting a 29 per cent increase in borrowing for this year as a whole, but we\u2019re seeing borrowing up twice that so far, at 60 per cent. Crucially these higher borrowing figures come before recent decisions by the new government to turn on the spending taps, and complicate the government\u2019s intention to increase public spending in the September spending round if they also want to remain committed to the current fiscal rules.\u201d Boris Johnson\u2019s rash of spending pledges - including more police and more NHS funding - will also blow a hole in the deficit this year. Josie Dent, Senior Economist at the CEBR think tank, explains: Boris Johnson has announced several expansionary fiscal policies since becoming Prime Minister, which are likely to increase government borrowing and expenditure in the future. Among the increased spending measures, he has promised more money for no-deal preparations and funding for an additional 10,000 prison places. He has also pledged to speed up the implementation of full fibre broadband and increase school funding. Meanwhile, the Prime Minister has also shown support for plans to raise the higher income tax band to \u00a380,000, in addition speaking favourably about a cut to the rate of tax on company profits. With the new Prime Minister\u2019s apparent shift in focus away from balancing the government\u2019s budgets, we are likely to see rising levels of borrowing in the coming months. Furthermore, with a recession possibly on the way, government intervention may be needed to stimulate the economy, which would add to the size of the deficit. Today\u2019s public finances also show how the government has failed to eliminate the budget deficit, in the decade since the financial crisis began. As you can see, this year\u2019s deficit was already expected to exceed last year\u2019s, even before July\u2019s unexpectedly small surplus (and a disappointingly large deficit in June). John McDonnell MP, Labour\u2019s Shadow Chancellor, isn\u2019t impressed by the jump in borrowing this financial year, saying: \u201cWith the Conservatives only interested in forcing through a No Deal Brexit, nine years of economic mismanagement have left our public services in a terrible state ahead of the Spending Review. \u201cInstead of borrowing yet more money to fund their failed programme of tax cuts, the priority has to be reversing the damage done to schools and social care, and stopping the rollout of Universal Credit which is causing so much hardship. \u201cLabour in government will deliver the radical transformation to our economy that is desperately needed to boost living standards and eliminate in-work poverty.\u201d Economist Rupert Seggins has spotted that higher public sector wages have helped push the deficit higher this year. That follows the abolition of the notorious 1% pay cap on public sector pay increases last year. Thomas Pugh of Capital Economics agrees that July\u2019s disappointingly small budget surplus means the UK may miss its deficit target for the 2019-20 financial year. Total borrowing for the current financial year was expected to rise to \u00a329.3bn, up from \u00a323.6bn in 2018-19. But....the UK has already borrowed \u00a316bn since the start of the financial year in April, up from \u00a310bn at this stage a year ago. So it\u2019s firmly on track to blow past that target. Pugh explains: It seems likely that government borrowing will continue to overshoot the OBRs forecast over the next few months as the government ramps up spending on preparations for a no deal Brexit. What\u2019s more, a change in the accounting treatment of student loans in September will raise the deficit by more than \u00a310bn a year. However, we doubt this will prevent the Chancellor from loosening fiscal policy in a one-year spending review in September or in an autumn budget, either before or after Brexit. Just how far borrowing rises will depend on whether there is a deal or a no deal, or a delay. Economist Sean Richards points out that government spending has increased compared with a year ago: Sumita Shah, regulatory policy manager at the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, warns that Brexit uncertainty is not helping: \u201cAs we lead up to the 31 October Brexit deadline, it\u2019s important that the government gets to grips with the bigger, long-term picture, which is maintaining the sustainability of our public finances. he government has a responsibility to instil confidence back into the UK economy, which will be essential if the economy is going to be in the best shape to face the challenges and opportunities of life outside the European Union.\u201d Just in: the UK is on track to MISS its borrowing targets this financial year. The latest public finances, just released, show that Britain posted a smaller budget surplus than hoped in July. The gap between spending and borrowing came in at \u00a31.3bn in July, down from a \u00a33.5bn surplus a year ago. Economists had expected the national coffers to swell by \u00a32.7bn, as July is a big month for self-assessment tax payments. The decline is due to government spending rising faster than government income. The Office for National Statistics reports that spending rose by 4.2% compared with July 2018, including a 2.6% rise in benefit spending. Total income, though, actually dropped by 0.5%, partly due to a 1.1% drop in corporation tax. That outpaced a 1.5% increase in income tax and capital gains receipts, and a 2.6% jump in VAT payments. There\u2019s another factor -- the Bank of England transferred less money to the government than a year ago, via the profits from its asset purchase scheme. This means Britain has borrowed \u00a316bn so far this financial year, \u00a36bn more than a year ago. More to follow... European stock markets have opened higher today, despite Donald Trump\u2019s latest attack on China. Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB is the top performer, gaining 1.5%, on hopes that a new coalition government can be formed. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx reckons investors are betting on central bank stimulus measures - especially as the White House isn\u2019t easing back on the trade war. This firmly green open came despite Trump doubling down on his trade war rhetoric. The President appeared to dismiss the risk of a recession, shifting to an ideological stance in the face of economic warning signs, stating the need to \u2018take China on\u2019 makes the battle worthwhile and that whether the outcome is good or bad in the short term is \u2018irrelevant\u2019. That kind of talk puts even more pressure on the Fed to safeguard the American economy, meaning investors are going to be on high alert for hints that the central bank is prepared to cut rates against relatively soon when they pour over July\u2019s meeting minutes this evening. Over in Rome, the battle to end the latest Italian political crisis has begun. Italy\u2019s president, Sergio Mattarella, has begun talks with political parties to see if a new government can be formed. Yesterday, prime minister Giuseppe Conte resigned following the collapse of his populist coalition, after the far-right League party walked out. League leader Matteo Salvini has hope to trigger new elections, but it\u2019s possible that a new coalition could be patched together. One possibility is that the centre-left Democratic Party replaces the League, in an alliance with the anti-establishment Five Star Movement. That would leave push the League into opposition and give Italy a more centrist, pro-European government. German finance minister Olaf Scholz predicted this morning that a new government will be created, avoiding new elections this autumn. Reuters has the details: Asked if he feared a new euro zone crisis, Scholz told German television: \u201cNo, there is no sign of that.\u201d Agreement had been reached with Italy on developing the European stability criteria even with the current government in Rome, he said. \u201cAnd it looks as if a new government, perhaps with a different composition, will emerge.\u201d Overnight, JP Morgan warned that the trade war will hit American families this autumn. It believes that the next swathe of tariffs, starting in September, will push the total cost towards $1,000 per year per household: It also warned that a swathe of US companies will be hit, including Apple, Harley-Davidson, Nike and Caterpillar. Trump\u2019s criticism of China helped to dampen the mood across Asia-Pacific markets today. China\u2019s CSI 300 index dipped slightly, while Australia\u2019s S&amp;P/ASX 200 shed almost 1% (its mining companies would suffer from a global slowdown). Japan\u2019s Nikkei slipped by 0.3%. Han Tan, market analyst at FXTM, says slowdown fears are weighing on investors: Asian stocks are mixed, with markets reluctant to get ahead of themselves in hoping for a near-term resolution to the US-China conflict. The intensifying concerns over the state of the global economy have only soured the outlooks for open and trade-dependent Asian economies, with such fears feeding into the performances of risk assets. Until there is a meaningful breakthrough in the US-China impasse, it would be a big ask for Asian assets to carve out substantial gains over the near-term. A more pronounced slowdown in the global economy will only reflect negatively in the currencies across Asia and emerging-markets. With relations with China stretched, the US is hoping to make headway with Japan over trade. Toshimitsu Motegi, Japan\u2019s economy minister, is due in Washington later today to discuss a \u201cmini\u201d bilateral trade agreement with Robert Lighthizer, the US trade representative. The aim is to agree a partial deal, in which Japan would give additional access to its agricultural market in return for America lowering some tariffs on Japanese manufactured goods. The FT says such a deal could bring \u201csome relief from the commercial tensions battering the world economy\u201d. Japan, though, is worried that the US will impose tariffs on its auto exports, so may be reluctant to agree a partial trade deal until this issue is also settled. More here. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Hopes of an early resolution to the trade war raging between Washington and Beijing have taken a knock, after President Donald Trump declared it was vital to \u201ctake China on\u201d, regardless of the short term economic damage. With fears of a US recession on the rise, Trump claimed that such concerns were \u201cirrelevant\u201d, given the need to challenge the Chinese administration. He told reporters gathered in the Oval Office that: \u201cIt\u2019s about time, whether it\u2019s good for our country or bad for our country short term.....The fact is somebody had to take China on.\u201d The tit-for-tat tariffs imposed on hundreds of billions of dollars of imports between the two countries have spooked the financial markets and slowed global growth, economists believe. They have also caused real pain to groups such as American farmers, through lost sales, and risk pushing up prices for consumers. Trump. though, insists that it\u2019s all worth it: \u201cThis is something that had to be done. The only difference is I am doing it,\u201d he said. \u201cChina has been ripping this country off for 25 years, for longer than that and it\u2019s about time whether it\u2019s good for our country or bad for our country short term. Long term it\u2019s imperative that somebody does this.\u201d The president also revealed he is considering a temporary payroll tax cut to help workers, implying the White House is seriously worried that the economy is turning sour ahead of next year\u2019s elections. But Trump also denied that a recession is looming (while also pointing the blame finger at central bankers at the Federal Reserve): \u201cWe\u2019re very far from a recession...In fact, if the Fed would do its job, I think we\u2019d have a tremendous spurt of growth, a tremendous spurt.\u201d Trump\u2019s comments were overshadowed by his remarkable decision to scrap his visit to Denmark, because prime minister Mette Frederiksen rebuffed his proposal to buy Greenland. But, such pugnacious comments about China suggest the trade dispute could rumble on for months. Unless there\u2019s a breakthrough, the US will impose fresh tariffs on September and December, doubtless triggering a retaliation. Also coming up today The latest UK public finances will show whether Britain is on track to hit its fiscal targets this year -- although a no-deal Brexit would blow them out of the water. Germany will attempt to sell a new 30-year bond that doesn\u2019t offer buyers any interest payments, in a test of the strength of the bond market rally. And after the European markets close, the US Fed will publish the minutes of its July meeting where it voted to cut interest rates. The agenda 9.30am BST: UK public finances for July (expected to show a surplus of \u00a32.7bn) 10.30am BST: Germany auctions 30-year bund with a zero coupon 3pm BST: US home sales for July 7pm BST: Minutes of the last Federal Reserve meeting",

He added that, as well as stretching police resources the protests were a significant drain on London. \u201cIt was a stress on the Met and it started to get worse and worse,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Shops reported drops in sales \u2013 as much as 13% for flagship stores and 20% for smaller ones \u2013 along with allegations of verbal abuse and stickers and chalk being put on property, he said.</p> <p>McMillan was giving evidence on the first day of the trial of Patrick Thelwell, 20, from York, Peter Scott, 66, from Devon, and Samuel Elmore, 26, from Hyde End. </p> <p>All three were charged with offences including breach of section 14 of the Public Order Act 1986, obstructing a highway and obstructing police. Their defence, in the case continuing today and tomorrow, is expected to be based on one of necessity \u2013 that they had to act as they did to save lives as a result of climate chaos.</p> <p>While other cases have involved Extinction Rebellions activists representing themselves, this trial is the first where a number have appeared together with legal representation in court. Their barrister is Russell Fraser, instructed by Bindmans solicitors.</p> <p>Counsel for the prosecution said that the trial was not about the individuals\u2019 ideology; it also was not about climate change and the crown would not be challenging a large amount of evidence which had been submitted to do with that.</p> <p>More than 1,000 people were detained at the protests, in what organisers described as the biggest civil disobedience event in recent British history.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A senior Scotland Yard officer giving evidence at the first group trial of Extinction Rebellion activists behind mass protests in central London said the demonstrators had provoked \u201csoul searching\u201d and proved articulate and rational as they made their case. The protests, in April this year, had found support even among the public facing severe disruption from the demonstrations, he said. But the officer, Duncan McMillan, a superintendent, also told City of London magistrates court that others had found the protests, which shut down sections of central London for some days, \u201cabhorrent\u201d. The demonstrations had caused NHS operations to be cancelled and meant ambulances were unable to move freely, the court was told by McMillan, who was a \u201cbronze\u201d commander in charge with operational policing during the protests. About 1,200 officers were deployed on the first and second days and 3,500 on the third day. He added that, as well as stretching police resources the protests were a significant drain on London. \u201cIt was a stress on the Met and it started to get worse and worse,\u201d he said. Shops reported drops in sales \u2013 as much as 13% for flagship stores and 20% for smaller ones \u2013 along with allegations of verbal abuse and stickers and chalk being put on property, he said. McMillan was giving evidence on the first day of the trial of Patrick Thelwell, 20, from York, Peter Scott, 66, from Devon, and Samuel Elmore, 26, from Hyde End. All three were charged with offences including breach of section 14 of the Public Order Act 1986, obstructing a highway and obstructing police. Their defence, in the case continuing today and tomorrow, is expected to be based on one of necessity \u2013 that they had to act as they did to save lives as a result of climate chaos. While other cases have involved Extinction Rebellions activists representing themselves, this trial is the first where a number have appeared together with legal representation in court. Their barrister is Russell Fraser, instructed by Bindmans solicitors. Counsel for the prosecution said that the trial was not about the individuals\u2019 ideology; it also was not about climate change and the crown would not be challenging a large amount of evidence which had been submitted to do with that. More than 1,000 people were detained at the protests, in what organisers described as the biggest civil disobedience event in recent British history.",

      "bodyText": "When I read this week that Olivia Laing would be sharing her James Tait Black prize winnings with her fellow shortlisted novelists, I was less surprised than some. Not because I know Laing (I don\u2019t), but because her decision made sense. In 2017, I donated half my winnings for the International Dublin Literary award to establish a new prize for debut translators, the TA First Translation prize. The previous week, Jessica Cohen won the Man Booker International prize and announced that half of her \u00a325,000 would be going to B\u2019Tselem, an Israeli human rights NGO. What we spend money on \u2013 especially in a business where there isn\u2019t enough to go around \u2013 is a statement of what we value. Prizes themselves are intended as statements of value, too. My own prize is shared between translators and their editors, because I want people to understand my esteem for the editorial role.

The FA is seeking a meeting with Twitter, and the Premier League is engaged in a dialogue with the platform and other relevant bodies, including the government. Last month the Premier League, FA and English Football League wrote an open letter to the minister for sport calling for a review of banning orders and the creation of a working group \u201cto establish where social media companies can support our desire to prevent discriminatory behaviour online\u201d. Twitter said: \u201cWe look forward to working more closely with our partners to develop shared solutions to this issue. In the meantime, for Twitter\u2019s part, we will continue to proactively monitor the conversation and take aggressive enforcement action when content violates our rules.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The family of a UK consulate worker who was detained in mainland China during a trip from Hong Kong nearly two weeks ago have voiced their fears for his safety and said they feel helpless. China said later that Simon Cheng, 28, had been made to serve 15 days of administrative detention in Shenzhen. A foreign ministry spokesman, Geng Shuang, said Cheng had violated China\u2019s public security administration punishment law, state media reported. Cheng, 28, who works in the British consulate in Hong Kong as a trade and investment officer for Scottish Development International, travelled to Shenzhen on 8 August on business. He sent messages to his girlfriend as he was about to cross the border at about 10pm and has not been heard from since, according to his family. \u201cWe lost contact with him since then,\u201d his family said in a statement posted on Facebook on Wednesday. \u201cWe feel very helpless and are worried sick about Simon. We hope Simon can return to Hong Kong as soon as possible.\u201d A rally was held outside the British consulate on Wednesday in protest at Cheng\u2019s detention. About two dozen supporters turned up outside the British consulate to demand the British government intervene. \u201cSave Simon now, delay no more. FCO [the UK\u2019s Foreign and Commonwealth Office], do your duty,\u201d they shouted. Michael Mo, an acquaintance of Cheng and an organiser of the rally, said: \u201cEngland expects every man to do his duty, and we expect every British politician will honour his words.\u201d Kelvin Chu, a teacher, said: \u201cThis has happened amid such a sensitive time. China is taking measures to control and monitor Hong Kong people. This is white terror.\u201d There have been reports in recent weeks that many Hong Kong residents are being interrogated when they enter mainland China. Many say they were taken into rooms and questioned upon their arrival, and messages and photos on their phones and computers were checked along with any paper documents they were carrying. Cheng\u2019s girlfriend, Li, said he had not participated in any of the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong over the last two months or expressed his position on the movement publicly. The family said that after they reported Cheng\u2019s disappearance to the Hong Kong authorities, the immigration department told them Cheng had been put under administrative detention on the mainland. The department said it had no information on his whereabouts, the reason for his detention or how long he would be detained. The family were told they could travel to mainland China to report his disappearance to local police. Formal notification of detention is supposed to be sent to a detainee\u2019s family within 24 hours. The family\u2019s lawyer said Cheng\u2019s case was being handled by police in Shenzhen, a Chinese city that borders Hong Kong, and his whereabouts remained unknown. Hong Kong police said an \u201cactive investigation\u201d was under way and they had maintained \u201cclose contact with relevant authorities in the mainland\u201d and kept in touch with his family. Cheng holds a British national overseas passport, which does not grant residence rights in the UK nor consular services in mainland China. His girlfriend believes he travelled to China on a home return permit, used by most Hong Kong Chinese while entering China. The UK Foreign Office has expressed \u201cextreme concern\u201d over Cheng\u2019s detention. The British consulate in Hong Kong said on Wednesday it had no further information on Cheng. Separately, hundreds of people took part in a sit-in at the out-of-town Yuen Long metro station on Wednesday night in protest at a violent indiscriminate attack on commuters and protesters there a month ago.

There\u2019s a graph illustrating their respective successes, and an idiot\u2019s guide to the strict conventions of the boxing movie. Then there\u2019s the tale of McNicholas\u2019s recent honeymoon. He goes whale-watching, gets seasick when back on land, and doesn\u2019t recover. And suddenly the show\u2019s ante \u2013 like a prize fight entering its final round \u2013 is upped. In these latter stages, an engaging but orthodox show becomes something quite special. A lovely joke, repeated and inverted, about the word punchdrunk floats a connection between McNicholas\u2019s neurological condition and Downes\u2019s career on the canvas, as our shmuck of a host finds himself fighting, figuratively speaking, for his life. In a show that\u2019s as structurally sound than Edinburgh Castle, McNicholas draws on the boxing movie tropes he itemised earlier to deliver a conclusion that floats like a butterfly and stings like a bee. Downes travels stateside to defend his crown; McNicholas is on the ropes, before a casual but profound word from granny offers last-reel redemption. It\u2019s heart-in-mouth stuff. I was tempted to run on stage and hold aloft McNicholas\u2019s gloved fist. His show is a knockout. \u2022 At the Pleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh, until 25 August. \u2022 Read all our Edinburgh festival reviews.",

However, the ONS said the estimate of EU net migration for the year to the end of March had been increased by 16% (29,000). This means an increase in the estimated EU migration from 178,000 to 207,000 for the year ending March 2016.</p> <p>The adjustments do not increase the estimate of the EU citizen population in the UK, which comes from a different data source and remains at 3,640,000 for 2018.</p> <p>Madeleine Sumption, the director of the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford, said: \u201cWe have been pointing out for a while that something wasn\u2019t quite right in the net migration statistics, and that the comparison of EU v non-EU net migration did not seem plausible.</p> <p>\u201cThis matters because for the past nine years the UK policy debate has been fixated on a single data source, which couldn\u2019t bear the load that it was forced to carry.</p> <p>\u201cWhether the question is how to meet the net migration target or what to do about international students, the truth is that the data were simply not robust enough to be picked apart in such detail. The quarterly drumbeat of migration statistics that has become a feature of the UK migration debate arguably just overdramatised small changes in figures that were always quite uncertain.\u201d</p> <p>The migration statistics quarterly report relied heavily on the international passenger survey (IPS), which collects information about passengers entering and leaving the UK. The IPS conducts between 700,000 and 800,000 interviews a year, of which more than 250,000 are used to produce estimates of overseas travel and tourism.</p> <p>The ONS said its research suggested migrants\u2019 uncertain intentions on their likely length of stay in the UK had impacted the way estimates were calculated.</p> <p>Iain Bell, the deputy national statistician, said: \u201cOur findings so far support previously published estimates of headline net migration. However, while the headline trend is broadly unchanged, our programme of work has revealed some differences between data sources.</p> <p>\u201cAs a result, EU migration may have been somewhat higher and non-EU migration somewhat lower than previously published. These differences largely reflect uncertainty in intentions among specific groups.\u201d</p>",

The admission that tens of thousands more EU immigrants have moved to Britain comes at a time of intense debate over freedom of movement, as the home secretary, Priti Patel, plans to bring it to an end in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The scale of the undercount is not yet known. However, the ONS said the estimate of EU net migration for the year to the end of March had been increased by 16% (29,000). This means an increase in the estimated EU migration from 178,000 to 207,000 for the year ending March 2016. The adjustments do not increase the estimate of the EU citizen population in the UK, which comes from a different data source and remains at 3,640,000 for 2018. Madeleine Sumption, the director of the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford, said: \u201cWe have been pointing out for a while that something wasn\u2019t quite right in the net migration statistics, and that the comparison of EU v non-EU net migration did not seem plausible. \u201cThis matters because for the past nine years the UK policy debate has been fixated on a single data source, which couldn\u2019t bear the load that it was forced to carry. \u201cWhether the question is how to meet the net migration target or what to do about international students, the truth is that the data were simply not robust enough to be picked apart in such detail. The quarterly drumbeat of migration statistics that has become a feature of the UK migration debate arguably just overdramatised small changes in figures that were always quite uncertain.\u201d The migration statistics quarterly report relied heavily on the international passenger survey (IPS), which collects information about passengers entering and leaving the UK. The IPS conducts between 700,000 and 800,000 interviews a year, of which more than 250,000 are used to produce estimates of overseas travel and tourism. The ONS said its research suggested migrants\u2019 uncertain intentions on their likely length of stay in the UK had impacted the way estimates were calculated. Iain Bell, the deputy national statistician, said: \u201cOur findings so far support previously published estimates of headline net migration. However, while the headline trend is broadly unchanged, our programme of work has revealed some differences between data sources. \u201cAs a result, EU migration may have been somewhat higher and non-EU migration somewhat lower than previously published. These differences largely reflect uncertainty in intentions among specific groups.\u201d",

The Plain View Project tracked publicly posted social media material from more than 3,500 confirmed current and retired law enforcement officers, and found that \u201cabout 1 in 5 of the current officers, and 2 in 5 of the retired officers, made public posts or comments ... displaying bias, applauding violence, scoffing at due process or using dehumanizing language\u201d. The Center for Investigative Reporting was able to identify almost 400 current and retired law enforcement officials who were members of private Facebook \u201cConfederate, anti-Islam, misogynistic or anti-government militia\u201d groups. We have seen racist text messages and emails among active officers revealed in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Portland and more, including among those in management with direct authority over law enforcement practices. As the Portland case proved, we must come to terms with the depth of association between senior law enforcement and white nationalist leaders and groups \u2013 people they should be investigating and thwarting, not encouraging and helping to evade justice. It would be naive to look at cases in which agencies have dismissed white nationalists from their ranks as an encouraging sign, whether in police departments, border patrol (an agent with a pattern of racist text messages ran over a Guatemalan migrant with a truck), the coast guard (a white nationalist aimed to \u201cmurder innocent civilians on a scale rarely seen in this country\u201d), military units (more Identity Evropa members in the Marines), or anywhere else. In truth, would the level of violence committed by law enforcement in communities of color, and at the border, even be possible if racial hatred weren\u2019t part and parcel of police culture? White nationalists in law enforcement and in many roles in government, such as prosecutors, are dangerous because they routinely abuse their power to attack and debilitate communities of color, including harassment and coercion, financial exploitation, acts of sexual and racially-targeted violence and mass incarceration \u2013 all officially sanctioned, and all celebrated as part of the larger white nationalist agenda. Within the FBI, there has been an active movement among white nationalist sympathizers to protect their own by unfoundedly targeting nonviolent black activists: inventing the idea of a black extremist threat to justify surveillance of nonviolent black activists and divert attention from truly violent white nationalist perpetrators. This policy was codified in an internal \u201cRace Paper\u201d that a federal court allowed to remain secret, despite a move for transparency led by my organization, Color Of Change. (And people who have spoken out about internal racism at the FBI have not been treated well.) Investigations have not yet uncovered the extent to which people in law enforcement at all levels are actually involved in white nationalist violence more directly: training and mentorship, advice and tips, offering the social validation that people of color and others are, in fact, the enemy, or offering the social validation that violence is, in fact, the answer. More stories from those who know what\u2019s happening inside law enforcement officers\u2019 lives would help. But we already know enough. We must change the incentives for law enforcement and their unions \u2013 financial, social, cultural and otherwise \u2013 that allow the denial of this threat to persist. Instead of allowing news media to praise law enforcement as problem-solvers, we must hold them to account for the harm they enable. Lawmakers across the country must also play their role: investigating the extent of the problem, and forcing a purge of white nationalists and their sympathizers from positions of power and influence \u2013 everywhere. Fighting white nationalist violence means doubling down on our fight for police accountability.",

      "bodyText": "I know it\u2019s coming \u2013 the double-take at my face, the auxiliary taps on the keyboard, the indiscreet scribble on my boarding pass. I find myself thinking a familiar thought: thank God I came early. On what seemed like a packed flight from London to Los Angeles \u2013 I was the only person pulled aside for \u201crandom additional security screening\u201d. A cursory glance around me tries to identify what it was about me that made me different. Was it the fact I was travelling alone? Nope, definitely some other lonely faces in the queue. Was is my tracksuit bottoms and snapback? Nope, plenty of other people who opted for comfort over aesthetics on this flight. I sighed. I know what it is. I\u2019ve known all along. It\u2019s the same thing it always is: My name, Aatif Nawaz. I smile politely as I\u2019m told to raise my hands as a security officer wipes over them with a device that resembles a service station toothbrush. I wonder how many hands those bristles have touched. Mental note: wash hands at earliest opportunity. Without looking up, the security officer asks, \u201cWhat\u2019s the purpose of your visit to LA?\u201d \u201cHoliday,\u201d I reply. \u201cWhy LA?\u201d \u201cWorking on my tan,\u201d I smile. \u201cTan?\u201d he smirks. I know what the smirk was about. I don\u2019t take the bait. \u201cYes. It\u2019s 40 degrees out there.\u201d He goes through my laptop bag, inspecting each item carefully. My laptop, my book, sequence of chargers, some chewing gum and stationery. The only moment that made me tense was when he flicked through the pages of my notebook. You see, somewhere near the middle was the outline of a comedy sketch about a Muslim man who gets stopped by airport security. This outline became the basis for a comedy sketch that featured in Muzlamic, a comedy show written by and starring myself and my good friend Ali Shahalom. Approximately 12 hours before this security official was messing with my pristine bag organisation structure, our show was broadcast on BBC Three. Eventually, I was allowed the rejoin the queue to board. I put my earphones in and let the soothing sounds of Tupac Shakur get me back into a California Love state of mind.

      "body": "<p>How can it be that the Best/Most Exciting/Richest League in the World\u2122 has still to avail itself of a chief executive, a full 14 months after Richard Scudamore announced he was standing down? Perhaps the Premier League\u2019s tireless quest for superlative accolades means it is trying to outstrip Belgium, which famously went for 589 days without a government. It is now certainly the most Chief Executiveless League in the World, and we can only salute Chelsea chairman Bruce Buck \u2013 who is handling the process of filling the role \u2013 for his courage, his strength, and his indefatigability.</p> <p>Having said that, the Premier League does have an acting chief executive in the form of Richard Masters, a man who has now been acting for so long that he is expected to receive a Bafta fellowship next year. The Premier League tell me that the search for Scudamore\u2019s replacement is \u201can ongoing process, with no set time frame\u201d, giving it the flavour of my intention to learn Mandarin, or sort out the top kitchen cupboards.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/21/eu-to-blame-football-new-handball-rule-ian-holloway\">EU to blame for football's new handball rule, claims Ian Holloway</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Right back at the start of this executive search, it was headline news. There was a flurry of interest way back in December, as it was announced Discovery executive Susanna Dinnage was to take the role. She later <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/dec/30/susanna-dinnage-pulls-out-of-becoming-new-premier-league-chief-executive\" title=\"\">pulled out</a>, with the next name in the frame reportedly being BBC Studios chief Tim Davie. He too is said to have ruled himself out. Then, last February, there were a couple of reports linking Javier Tebas, the cuddly far right nationalist who runs La Liga, with the job. La Liga duly issued a statement stressing that Tebas was committed to them.</p> <p>Then it was Sir Gary Verity\u2019s turn, with the then-chief executive of Welcome to Yorkshire, and the man who brought the Tour de France to the county, soon withdrawing from what we\u2019ll by now charitably style as \u201cthe process\u201d, following some kind of expenses furore, with a side order of bullying allegations. The next person to be linked with the role was ITV\u2019s strategy chief Tom Betts, but that was back in April, and since then it has all been serenely quiet. The executive vacuum at the top of the Premier League is perhaps now accepted as simply a fact of footballing life in this land, like children being encouraged to gamble, or make obscene finger gestures at opposition players behind the goal.</p> <p>Anyway. When, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/17/premier-league-tim-davie-declines-chief-executive-richard-scudamore-susanna-dinnage\" title=\"\">or if, the position is ever filled</a>, the new incumbent could have a historic commercial opportunity to offset against the stalled media rights growth \u2013 if only he or she has the balls to embrace it.

      "bodyText": "How can it be that the Best/Most Exciting/Richest League in the World\u2122 has still to avail itself of a chief executive, a full 14 months after Richard Scudamore announced he was standing down? Perhaps the Premier League\u2019s tireless quest for superlative accolades means it is trying to outstrip Belgium, which famously went for 589 days without a government. It is now certainly the most Chief Executiveless League in the World, and we can only salute Chelsea chairman Bruce Buck \u2013 who is handling the process of filling the role \u2013 for his courage, his strength, and his indefatigability. Having said that, the Premier League does have an acting chief executive in the form of Richard Masters, a man who has now been acting for so long that he is expected to receive a Bafta fellowship next year. The Premier League tell me that the search for Scudamore\u2019s replacement is \u201can ongoing process, with no set time frame\u201d, giving it the flavour of my intention to learn Mandarin, or sort out the top kitchen cupboards. Right back at the start of this executive search, it was headline news. There was a flurry of interest way back in December, as it was announced Discovery executive Susanna Dinnage was to take the role. She later pulled out, with the next name in the frame reportedly being BBC Studios chief Tim Davie. He too is said to have ruled himself out. Then, last February, there were a couple of reports linking Javier Tebas, the cuddly far right nationalist who runs La Liga, with the job. La Liga duly issued a statement stressing that Tebas was committed to them. Then it was Sir Gary Verity\u2019s turn, with the then-chief executive of Welcome to Yorkshire, and the man who brought the Tour de France to the county, soon withdrawing from what we\u2019ll by now charitably style as \u201cthe process\u201d, following some kind of expenses furore, with a side order of bullying allegations. The next person to be linked with the role was ITV\u2019s strategy chief Tom Betts, but that was back in April, and since then it has all been serenely quiet. The executive vacuum at the top of the Premier League is perhaps now accepted as simply a fact of footballing life in this land, like children being encouraged to gamble, or make obscene finger gestures at opposition players behind the goal. Anyway. When, or if, the position is ever filled, the new incumbent could have a historic commercial opportunity to offset against the stalled media rights growth \u2013 if only he or she has the balls to embrace it. To wit, what has been described as the most exciting sponsorship opening in contemporary football. Yes, it\u2019s the chance to get your name all over the VAR breaks! Or the name of your bitterest business rival, whatever feels most judicious in the circumstances. Back in May, one sports marketing executive estimated to the Financial Times that VAR had been on screen for 27 minutes during last summer\u2019s World Cup, and hazarded that the bigger international tournaments could clear \u00a350m for sponsorship of this most pregnant of pauses, or up to \u00a3100m if bundled with other opportunities. Little could be more inevitable than confirmation from Fifa that they were receiving approaches from companies keen to be associated with the Infuriating Scientific Hiatus. Fifa were currently rejecting the offers, but indicated that would change once development of the system itself was no longer the \u201ctop priority\u201d. (Needless to say, there is a whole school of conspiracists who deem football so commercialised that they believe the VAR system has specifically been introduced for this purpose.) With most advertising being pitchside or on players\u2019 kit, the chance to have your brand plastered over something absolutely central to the progress of a match must feel tempting.

It\u2019s the morning after the first show of the second series: the reviews are good and so is the social media response, with myriad lustful tweets aimed Culkin\u2019s way.

As Roman Roy, the brattish, brutish son of a Rupert Murdoch-esque media magnate, he plots and curses his way through the cut-throat world of Succession. Crafted by Peep Show co-creator <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jul/29/succession-comedy-drama-tv-media-barons-jesse-armstrong\">Jesse Armstrong</a>, the blackly comic drama has become one of TV\u2019s most addictive pleasures. It\u2019s unapologetically, aggressively nasty. I tell Culkin I was initially turned off by the concept of watching an obnoxious, rich family get richer and even more obnoxious.</p> <p>\u201cI had that exact feeling when we shot it,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen we read the pilot, I thought this is very well written, I love this character, I would love to play it but I don\u2019t know who would want to watch.\u201d It took him five episodes to realise that not only would people care \u2013 they\u2019d become obsessed. \u201cThere\u2019s something that draws you to these characters even though you don\u2019t give a fuck about them.\u201d</p> <p>His character was a fan favourite in season one thanks to his seemingly unending stream of vulgarities: in episode three he masturbates victoriously against the window of his corner office, thinking about the proles on the street below. Nonetheless, as the show progresses, Culkin is worried about the dangers of self-parody. \u201cHere\u2019s a sentence that I dread will come out on set: \u2018That\u2019s so Roman,\u2019\u201d he says, eyes rolling. \u201cThere are directors who will come in and see it like, \u2018This can be like an iconic character if he\u2019s treated this way.\u2019 It\u2019s like no, he\u2019s actually just a person.\u201d</p> <p>While he\u2019s gratified by the reviews and his Golden Globe nomination last year, he\u2019s mainly relieved not to be mistaken as much for another Culkin. \u201cI get [called] Rory and Rory gets called me,\u201d he says of his actor brother, six years his junior. \u201cA lot of the crew come up and say they worked with me on Mean Creek\u201d \u2013 the 2004 coming-of-age drama that starred his brother. \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018Oh you did? Was I cool?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>His family name has long preceded his first, thanks to the success of his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jul/18/macauley-culkin-no-i-was-not-pounding-six-grand-of-heroin-a-month\">older brother Macaulay</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jul/18/macauley-culkin-no-i-was-not-pounding-six-grand-of-heroin-a-month\">, who became the world\u2019s most famous kid</a> in 1990 with the release of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/nov/30/home-alone-review-yuletide-rerelease\">Home Alone</a>. Kieran first appeared alongside his brother as bed-wetting Fuller in the Christmas comedy before taking roles in Jean-Claude Van Damme\u2019s action film Nowhere to Run and two Father of the Bride movies. But despite having been prolific \u2013 he\u2019d made seven movies before he turned 13 \u2013 he rejects the obvious label. \u201cI managed to avoid being a child star,\u201d he tells me. \u201cI just did the thing and I was a kid. I went home, played video games.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e902cde9eb6ededa591c4f0229ae0b465776f4f0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e902cde9eb6ededa591c4f0229ae0b465776f4f0/0_0_5675_3728/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kieran Culkin, left, front, in 1990, with his brother Macaulay Culkin, father Kit and mother Patricia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"657\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kieran Culkin (left, front) in 1990 with his brother Macaulay Culkin, father Kit and mother Patricia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: News UK Ltd/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The experience, he says, was boringly normal. Enrolled at a school that catered for children who worked, Culkin studied alongside musicians, dancers and golfers. He credits school with helping to avoid some of the excesses that have afflicted many child actors. \u201cIf you\u2019re surrounded by other people in that situation, you compare yourself to others and just know that that person has their head up their ass,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t have an image of myself as an actor when I was a kid, if that makes sense.\u201d</p> <p>His childhood wasn\u2019t without its setbacks. His father, Kit, was an unsuccessful actor who brought up his eight children to be performers whether they liked it or not, all of them living in a boxy railway apartment in New York. In the 90s, Kieran was caught in the middle of a custody battle won by his mother, Patricia, and remains estranged from his father. The press at the time was difficult to endure. \u201cSometimes they just fully fabricated stories,\u201d Culkin says. \u201cThey would get lots of details way wrong \u2013 our names, our ages, things like that. So I grew up going OK, not everything that you read is true.\u201d</p> <p>Tabloid attention was intensified by the fact that Macaulay was a close friend of Michael Jackson, regularly visiting the singer\u2019s Neverland ranch with Kieran in tow. \u201cI have slept in a bed with many children,\u201d Jackson told Martin Bashir in 2003. \u201cI slept in a bed with all of them when Macaulay Culkin was little. Kieran Culkin would sleep on this side, Macaulay Culkin was on this side. We all would just jam in the bed.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9TKHvvaMfE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/l9TKHvvaMfE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>It was a creepy enough anecdote at the time, but since HBO\u2019s devastating documentary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/mar/06/leaving-neverland-review-michael-jackson-documentary\">Leaving Neverland</a>, in which two victims said that Jackson had subjected them to years of sexual abuse, it seems particularly grim. Culkin shifts uncomfortably, but he has seen the question coming \u2013 he tells me that he realised I would ask him about Jackson before the interview. He points out that he doesn\u2019t have media training, signalling that what follows hasn\u2019t been publicist-approved. </p> <p>\u201cThe only thing I can say is that I can\u2019t really say anything and the reason for that is I can\u2019t be helpful to anyone,\u201d he says earnestly. \u201cTo me, it seems like there\u2019s two sides to this thing and because I can\u2019t be helpful on one side or the other, anything I say and anything that gets put out in print could only hurt somebody and there\u2019s already a lot of really hurt feelings. There are already a lot of people who are in a difficult position and if I contribute in any way, it\u2019s just going to hurt someone because I can\u2019t actually help.\u201d</p> <p>He won\u2019t be drawn any further, so I ask him about the recently announced plan to reboot Home Alone, news that takes him by surprise. \u201cThat kid would definitely be fucked up by now,\u201d he says, adding that the original film \u201cstill holds up. It still makes me laugh and I can\u2019t wait to show my kids.\u201d Culkin\u2019s wife, British former model Jazz Charton, is eight months pregnant, something that makes him \u201cexcited\u201d. Would he encourage his child to follow his career path? \u201cIf the kid wanted to get into acting, I\u2019d be all for it,\u201d he says. \u201cNot a lot of former child actors would want to put their kids through it.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>It took until I was 35 and I had been doing it for about 29 years for me to go, \u2018Hey, I think I want to be an actor'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Culkin says he suffered a crisis of confidence at 20. After his acclaimed turn as a spoilt slacker in 2002\u2019s Igby Goes Down, \u201cI realised I\u2019d been doing it for 14 years and I never once made the decision \u2018Hey, I want to be an actor.\u2019 So I flipped out and \u2013 you can check my IMDb \u2013 I didn\u2019t work for years. I didn\u2019t know what I wanted to do with my life.\u201d</p> <p>It was only with Succession that he became comfortable with acting again. \u201cWe were shooting last season when I came home one day and I said: \u2018I think this is what I want to do.\u2019 It took until I was 35 and I had been doing it for about 29 years for me to go, \u2018Hey, I think I want to be an actor.\u2019\u201d Besides, he adds, \u201cbaby needs food\u201d.</p> <p>Despite this newfound passion for who he is on screen, he\u2019s still unsure about how he presents himself off it. \u201cI\u2019m terrible in print because I just sort of speak in these fragments and then it\u2019s your job to try to piece it together and make some sense,\u201d he says. Does he enjoy doing interviews? \u201cI have a feeling you\u2019re saying this because I\u2019ve already fucked myself two or three times?\u201d he laughs quizzically. But as Roman would put it, hell no \u2013 only with a stronger expletive.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.sky.com/watch/title/series/6b0e0ac5-c207-489a-851c-f5d911e14c27\">Season two of Succession is on Mondays on Sky Atlantic and Now TV.</a></p>",

Even when talking about things he dislikes, there\u2019s something likable about the way he frames it, a devilish smile emerging throughout. It\u2019s a similar quality that makes his performance in the Emmy-nominated drama so magnetic. As Roman Roy, the brattish, brutish son of a Rupert Murdoch-esque media magnate, he plots and curses his way through the cut-throat world of Succession. Crafted by Peep Show co-creator Jesse Armstrong, the blackly comic drama has become one of TV\u2019s most addictive pleasures. It\u2019s unapologetically, aggressively nasty. I tell Culkin I was initially turned off by the concept of watching an obnoxious, rich family get richer and even more obnoxious. \u201cI had that exact feeling when we shot it,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen we read the pilot, I thought this is very well written, I love this character, I would love to play it but I don\u2019t know who would want to watch.\u201d It took him five episodes to realise that not only would people care \u2013 they\u2019d become obsessed. \u201cThere\u2019s something that draws you to these characters even though you don\u2019t give a fuck about them.\u201d His character was a fan favourite in season one thanks to his seemingly unending stream of vulgarities: in episode three he masturbates victoriously against the window of his corner office, thinking about the proles on the street below. Nonetheless, as the show progresses, Culkin is worried about the dangers of self-parody. \u201cHere\u2019s a sentence that I dread will come out on set: \u2018That\u2019s so Roman,\u2019\u201d he says, eyes rolling. \u201cThere are directors who will come in and see it like, \u2018This can be like an iconic character if he\u2019s treated this way.\u2019 It\u2019s like no, he\u2019s actually just a person.\u201d While he\u2019s gratified by the reviews and his Golden Globe nomination last year, he\u2019s mainly relieved not to be mistaken as much for another Culkin. \u201cI get [called] Rory and Rory gets called me,\u201d he says of his actor brother, six years his junior. \u201cA lot of the crew come up and say they worked with me on Mean Creek\u201d \u2013 the 2004 coming-of-age drama that starred his brother. \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018Oh you did? Was I cool?\u2019\u201d His family name has long preceded his first, thanks to the success of his older brother Macaulay, who became the world\u2019s most famous kid in 1990 with the release of Home Alone. Kieran first appeared alongside his brother as bed-wetting Fuller in the Christmas comedy before taking roles in Jean-Claude Van Damme\u2019s action film Nowhere to Run and two Father of the Bride movies. But despite having been prolific \u2013 he\u2019d made seven movies before he turned 13 \u2013 he rejects the obvious label. \u201cI managed to avoid being a child star,\u201d he tells me. \u201cI just did the thing and I was a kid. I went home, played video games.\u201d The experience, he says, was boringly normal. Enrolled at a school that catered for children who worked, Culkin studied alongside musicians, dancers and golfers. He credits school with helping to avoid some of the excesses that have afflicted many child actors. \u201cIf you\u2019re surrounded by other people in that situation, you compare yourself to others and just know that that person has their head up their ass,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t have an image of myself as an actor when I was a kid, if that makes sense.\u201d His childhood wasn\u2019t without its setbacks. His father, Kit, was an unsuccessful actor who brought up his eight children to be performers whether they liked it or not, all of them living in a boxy railway apartment in New York. In the 90s, Kieran was caught in the middle of a custody battle won by his mother, Patricia, and remains estranged from his father. The press at the time was difficult to endure. \u201cSometimes they just fully fabricated stories,\u201d Culkin says. \u201cThey would get lots of details way wrong \u2013 our names, our ages, things like that. So I grew up going OK, not everything that you read is true.\u201d Tabloid attention was intensified by the fact that Macaulay was a close friend of Michael Jackson, regularly visiting the singer\u2019s Neverland ranch with Kieran in tow. \u201cI have slept in a bed with many children,\u201d Jackson told Martin Bashir in 2003. \u201cI slept in a bed with all of them when Macaulay Culkin was little. Kieran Culkin would sleep on this side, Macaulay Culkin was on this side. We all would just jam in the bed.\u201d It was a creepy enough anecdote at the time, but since HBO\u2019s devastating documentary Leaving Neverland, in which two victims said that Jackson had subjected them to years of sexual abuse, it seems particularly grim. Culkin shifts uncomfortably, but he has seen the question coming \u2013 he tells me that he realised I would ask him about Jackson before the interview. He points out that he doesn\u2019t have media training, signalling that what follows hasn\u2019t been publicist-approved. \u201cThe only thing I can say is that I can\u2019t really say anything and the reason for that is I can\u2019t be helpful to anyone,\u201d he says earnestly. \u201cTo me, it seems like there\u2019s two sides to this thing and because I can\u2019t be helpful on one side or the other, anything I say and anything that gets put out in print could only hurt somebody and there\u2019s already a lot of really hurt feelings. There are already a lot of people who are in a difficult position and if I contribute in any way, it\u2019s just going to hurt someone because I can\u2019t actually help.\u201d He won\u2019t be drawn any further, so I ask him about the recently announced plan to reboot Home Alone, news that takes him by surprise. \u201cThat kid would definitely be fucked up by now,\u201d he says, adding that the original film \u201cstill holds up. It still makes me laugh and I can\u2019t wait to show my kids.\u201d Culkin\u2019s wife, British former model Jazz Charton, is eight months pregnant, something that makes him \u201cexcited\u201d. Would he encourage his child to follow his career path? \u201cIf the kid wanted to get into acting, I\u2019d be all for it,\u201d he says. \u201cNot a lot of former child actors would want to put their kids through it.\u201d Culkin says he suffered a crisis of confidence at 20. After his acclaimed turn as a spoilt slacker in 2002\u2019s Igby Goes Down, \u201cI realised I\u2019d been doing it for 14 years and I never once made the decision \u2018Hey, I want to be an actor.\u2019 So I flipped out and \u2013 you can check my IMDb \u2013 I didn\u2019t work for years. I didn\u2019t know what I wanted to do with my life.\u201d It was only with Succession that he became comfortable with acting again. \u201cWe were shooting last season when I came home one day and I said: \u2018I think this is what I want to do.\u2019 It took until I was 35 and I had been doing it for about 29 years for me to go, \u2018Hey, I think I want to be an actor.\u2019\u201d Besides, he adds, \u201cbaby needs food\u201d. Despite this newfound passion for who he is on screen, he\u2019s still unsure about how he presents himself off it. \u201cI\u2019m terrible in print because I just sort of speak in these fragments and then it\u2019s your job to try to piece it together and make some sense,\u201d he says. Does he enjoy doing interviews? \u201cI have a feeling you\u2019re saying this because I\u2019ve already fucked myself two or three times?\u201d he laughs quizzically. But as Roman would put it, hell no \u2013 only with a stronger expletive. \u2022 Season two of Succession is on Mondays on Sky Atlantic and Now TV.",

This Saent disc sits on your desk and gives you more control over the flow of your day, combining periods of focus with well-earned mental breaks. You simply tap Saent to start a timed session for a focus task and it\u2019ll lock down unproductive sites and digital distractions to create space for you to really concentrate. A green-red light system also alerts colleagues that you\u2019re working on something and want to avoid interruptions. After you complete your head-down working session, the app automatically calculates the length of the break you need to take to recharge. Otter.ai Writing up the minutes or notes from meetings is a classic workplace time-killer. It\u2019s also a distraction for employees, who spend more time making sure they\u2019ve made good notes than engaging in the meeting as it\u2019s taking place. Otter is an app that lets you get your head out of your notebook, or close your laptop screen. It automatically turns voice into editable notes in real time, can be embellished with pictures and worked on collaboratively. Like all dictation apps it\u2019s not perfect, but the accuracy is ample for logging meetings, and notes can be shared with all attendees in an instant. Just Call Me Conference calls can save time wasted on travelling for face-to-face conversations. But setting up remote meetings for groups can be a complicated time sink. Not to mention there\u2019s always a healthy dose of faff while people trawl emails and meeting invites for the dial-in codes, or realise they\u2019ve not downloaded the desktop plugin they need to join a call. O2\u2019s Just Call Me app simplifies the process, removing the need for premium rate dial-in numbers or complicated pin codes \u2013 you simply use the app to set the date and time, and invite all the participants to call your mobile number. Only the meeting coordinator needs the app and meetings sync straight to your calendar. And you can invite hundreds on to a call \u2013 should you want to. SaneBox Email is a classic example of a communication tool that was designed to make life easier but regularly makes it less efficient. SaneBox is a fantastic app that lets you take back control of your inbox with a suite of features that learns your email flow well enough to smooth out the irritations of incoming messages. It can identify important messages, hold non-urgent emails, block annoying repeat mailers and remind you to follow up important emails. It\u2019ll automatically store attachments in Dropbox or Google Drive and even has a Do Not Disturb function. In other words, it makes email much, much easier. Muse 2.0 A headset that teaches you how to be mindful might not seem like the obvious tool to add to your company\u2019s communal chill-out spaces, but studies show that periods of mindfulness can boost focus and productivity, lower stress and even help employees make smarter decisions. Muse uses electroencephalogram (EEG) sensors, along with motion and heart-rate monitors, to track brain activity, heart rate, movement and breathing, and works with a smartphone app to provide audio-guided coaching to help you learn to control your body and mind more effectively. When your thoughts wander, your heart rate races due to stress or you fidget, the soundscape changes \u2013 from a calm breeze to a rainstorm, for example \u2013 so you can tell when you\u2019re really hitting the restorative zone. The headset can be paired to more than one phone too, making it ideal as a shared tool for easing workplace stress. Myo2business Used well, smartphones are liberating tools that let your people get work done whenever and wherever they need to. Myo2business simplifies the process of managing a fleet of phones in businesses of any size. From one centralised dashboard you can see which members of staff have a mobile at any given time, monitor activity and spot trends in usage. This results in potentially money-saving data being available in an instant. You can also order new equipment, hardware and phones, and even use Myo2business to set up internal billing for mobile phone usage across different departments.",

      "body": "<p>On exam results days, there\u2019s now something of a social media tradition of those long out of the school system sharing stories of success despite a disappointing set of results. In some cases it\u2019s an honest attempt to reassure those who\u2019ve not hit the high grades that their future is one still full of potential; for <a href=\"https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/jeremy-clarkson-day-level-results-16759294\">Jeremy Clarkson</a> it\u2019s just an annual excuse to show off.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/jul/30/attainment-gap-widens-disadvantaged-gcse-pupils-study\">Attainment gap widens for disadvantaged GCSE pupils, study finds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And while the sentiment from many is admirable \u2013 of course exams taken in your teens should not define your life \u2013 there\u2019s no denying that when 16-year-olds across the UK open their GCSE results tomorrow, much will be determined by what they find inside. Without the right grades, colleges and sixth forms might reject you; the doors to competitive degree courses and universities will either be a little more open or resolutely slammed shut.</p> <p>Professions such as <a href=\"https://university.which.co.uk/advice/gcse-choices-university/how-important-are-my-gcse-grades#career\">teaching, social work and medicine</a> require certain GCSE results as a minimum, while <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/529390/2013-11-01-bmg-research-with-employers-on-new-gcse-grades.pdf\">research has found</a> that only 16% of employers don\u2019t consider them at all. And then there\u2019s the message that doing badly can so easily send to a child: that they\u2019re not academic, and that the path of further education is not one they should take.</p> <p>It\u2019s why new analysis from Teach First <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/aug/21/poorer-pupils-twice-as-likely-to-fail-key-gcses\">published today</a> requires urgent attention \u2013 the findings are both deeply worrying yet unsurprising at the same time. According to research by the education charity, pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds are almost twice as likely to fail GCSE maths as their wealthier classmates; they\u2019re also only half as likely to hit the highest grades as their more privileged peers. There\u2019s a similar pattern across subjects from English literature to geography and French.

      "bodyText": "On exam results days, there\u2019s now something of a social media tradition of those long out of the school system sharing stories of success despite a disappointing set of results. In some cases it\u2019s an honest attempt to reassure those who\u2019ve not hit the high grades that their future is one still full of potential; for Jeremy Clarkson it\u2019s just an annual excuse to show off. And while the sentiment from many is admirable \u2013 of course exams taken in your teens should not define your life \u2013 there\u2019s no denying that when 16-year-olds across the UK open their GCSE results tomorrow, much will be determined by what they find inside. Without the right grades, colleges and sixth forms might reject you; the doors to competitive degree courses and universities will either be a little more open or resolutely slammed shut. Professions such as teaching, social work and medicine require certain GCSE results as a minimum, while research has found that only 16% of employers don\u2019t consider them at all. And then there\u2019s the message that doing badly can so easily send to a child: that they\u2019re not academic, and that the path of further education is not one they should take. It\u2019s why new analysis from Teach First published today requires urgent attention \u2013 the findings are both deeply worrying yet unsurprising at the same time. According to research by the education charity, pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds are almost twice as likely to fail GCSE maths as their wealthier classmates; they\u2019re also only half as likely to hit the highest grades as their more privileged peers. There\u2019s a similar pattern across subjects from English literature to geography and French. And this attainment gap is currently getting worse. Our education system is letting down poorer children \u2013 and in response all we do is scribble \u201cmust try harder\u201d on their reports. The myth of the meritocracy has been laid bare. These findings aren\u2019t just frustrating, they throw the entire validity of our exam system up in the air.

      "body": "<p>Stalwart of a thousand summer lunch parties, the pavlova, a magnificent billowing cloud of cream and meringue and seasonal fruit, is named after the Russian ballerina Anna Pavlova, who visited Australia and New Zealand in 1926. Which Antipodean nation can take credit for it, however, is unclear \u2013 though the combination of meringue and cream is far older than Anna herself, both countries claim the pavlova as their own.</p> <p>The safest course to steer seems to be that of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Leach\" title=\"\">Helen M Leach</a>, who, having reviewed the evidence in her book The Pavlova Cake: the Evolution of a National Dish, declares her \u201cpreferred, more diplomatic conclusion is that we are dealing with a case of convergent cultural evolution.\u201d</p> <p>What is indisputable is that, whether summer comes in December or July, whether it brings rambutans or raspberries, pavlova is the perfect dessert when you want to make the most of the season\u2019s fruit with something a bit fancier than Eton mess. Not the height of fashion, perhaps, but like ballet itself, always a joy to behold.</p> <h2>The meringue</h2> <p>It may be hidden beneath layers of fruit and cream, but the meringue base is what separates a decent pavlova (because really, it\u2019s very hard to make something bad from meringue and cream) from a truly great one. Though anything involving whipped egg whites tends to strike fear into the slapdash cook\u2019s heart (I speak personally), meringues are in fact very easy to make, as long as you follow a few basic rules, all of which revolve around keeping the whites as far as possible from anything that will burst their bubbles. Separate your eggs with meticulous care to avoid getting even the merest smidgen of fat in the whites (or substitute ready-separated egg whites if you don\u2019t plan to make carbonara or custard with the spare yolks), and use a scrupulously clean metal or glass bowl and whisk to whip them up \u2013 any grease or washing-up liquid will stop them achieving their full potential.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"e33f3b80e96c76f1deed26ad4ab8c12753e43ec4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e33f3b80e96c76f1deed26ad4ab8c12753e43ec4/0_0_3024_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bill Granger adds cream of tartar, vinegar, cornflour and arrowroot to prop up his meringue.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bill Granger adds cream of tartar, vinegar, cornflour <em>and</em> arrowroot to prop up his meringue.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Many recipes add a little acid to help stabilise the foam, in the form of cream of tartar or vinegar; or starch, in the form of cornflour or arrowroot (or all of the above, if you\u2019re <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Granger\" title=\"\">Bill Granger</a>).

She\u2019s right \u2013 her meringue, made solely from egg whites and sugar, is pretty perfect, while some of the starch heavy versions have an unpleasant powdery finish. However if, like me, you\u2019re not <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/deliasmith\" title=\"\">Delia Smith</a>, it\u2019s easier to get maximum volume with the help of a little cream of tartar or similar.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"3735cc0455bc03ecd75fd297870c484934c9eb73\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3735cc0455bc03ecd75fd297870c484934c9eb73/0_0_4032_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"But Delia Smith doesn\u2019t use cornflour OR vinegar, as they make \u201cvery little difference\u201d.

Oddly, we discover, it is possible for a meringue to be too sweet, and \u2013 traditionally at least \u2013 the pavlova should still have \u201cthe promise of squidginess\u201d in the middle, as Nigella Lawson puts it so beautifully in her book, Forever Summer. Most of the recipes I try use somewhere between 150-175g per three egg whites, with the exception of <a href=\"https://www.maggiebeer.com.au/\" title=\"\">Maggie Beer</a>, who goes for 330g, possibly because she\u2019s pairing it with acidic fruit in this particular instance. For a more versatile recipe, however, I\u2019m going to keep the sugar content fairly low.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/series/yotam-ottolenghi-recipes\" title=\"\">Yotam Ottolenghi </a>and <a href=\"https://ottolenghi.co.uk/simplepleasures/helengoh\" title=\"\">Helen Goh</a> heat the meringue mixture while whisking, more like an Italian meringue, which does indeed give it a beautifully voluminous consistency, but we\u2019ve no complaints about Smith\u2019s version. More important, for a really luscious middle, is not to let it completely dry out in the oven, as you would with crisper <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2010/aug/19/how-to-make-perfect-meringue\" title=\"\">meringues</a> \u2013 that \u201cpromise of squidge\u201d is important \u2013 a fairly low temperature is still desirable, however, so it doesn\u2019t caramelise. If you want it to sit for a while you might consider painting the base with melted chocolate, as Ottolenghi and Goh do, to form a protective barrier between cream and meringue.</p> <p>Lawson also recommends a family tip from Australian food writer <a href=\"http://www.stephaniealexander.com.au/\" title=\"\">Stephanie Alexander</a> referenced in How To Eat, which is to turn the meringue base over before smearing it with cream, so \u201cthe marshmallow middle melds with cream and the sides and the base stay crisp\u201d, though I prefer the look of them built up around the edge, which of course is impossible to achieve upside down.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"8ec8bc5e076f0540bcc0ae6e80015fec37679f84\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8ec8bc5e076f0540bcc0ae6e80015fec37679f84/0_0_3024_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Yotam Ottololenghi and Helen Goh use a mixture of mascarpone and cream.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yotam Ottololenghi and Helen Goh use a mixture of mascarpone and cream in the topping.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>You can flavour the meringue with brown sugar, which Ottolenghi and Goh credit for the \u201cgooey, almost toffee-like\u201d consistency of their base.

      "bodyText": "Stalwart of a thousand summer lunch parties, the pavlova, a magnificent billowing cloud of cream and meringue and seasonal fruit, is named after the Russian ballerina Anna Pavlova, who visited Australia and New Zealand in 1926. Which Antipodean nation can take credit for it, however, is unclear \u2013 though the combination of meringue and cream is far older than Anna herself, both countries claim the pavlova as their own. The safest course to steer seems to be that of Helen M Leach, who, having reviewed the evidence in her book The Pavlova Cake: the Evolution of a National Dish, declares her \u201cpreferred, more diplomatic conclusion is that we are dealing with a case of convergent cultural evolution.\u201d What is indisputable is that, whether summer comes in December or July, whether it brings rambutans or raspberries, pavlova is the perfect dessert when you want to make the most of the season\u2019s fruit with something a bit fancier than Eton mess. Not the height of fashion, perhaps, but like ballet itself, always a joy to behold. The meringue It may be hidden beneath layers of fruit and cream, but the meringue base is what separates a decent pavlova (because really, it\u2019s very hard to make something bad from meringue and cream) from a truly great one. Though anything involving whipped egg whites tends to strike fear into the slapdash cook\u2019s heart (I speak personally), meringues are in fact very easy to make, as long as you follow a few basic rules, all of which revolve around keeping the whites as far as possible from anything that will burst their bubbles. Separate your eggs with meticulous care to avoid getting even the merest smidgen of fat in the whites (or substitute ready-separated egg whites if you don\u2019t plan to make carbonara or custard with the spare yolks), and use a scrupulously clean metal or glass bowl and whisk to whip them up \u2013 any grease or washing-up liquid will stop them achieving their full potential. Many recipes add a little acid to help stabilise the foam, in the form of cream of tartar or vinegar; or starch, in the form of cornflour or arrowroot (or all of the above, if you\u2019re Bill Granger). But as Delia Smith tartly notes: \u201cI never make this with the traditional cornflour and vinegar, since side-by-side comparisons have revealed very little difference\u201d. She\u2019s right \u2013 her meringue, made solely from egg whites and sugar, is pretty perfect, while some of the starch heavy versions have an unpleasant powdery finish. However if, like me, you\u2019re not Delia Smith, it\u2019s easier to get maximum volume with the help of a little cream of tartar or similar. The more sugar you use, the crisper, and of course sweeter, the end result. Oddly, we discover, it is possible for a meringue to be too sweet, and \u2013 traditionally at least \u2013 the pavlova should still have \u201cthe promise of squidginess\u201d in the middle, as Nigella Lawson puts it so beautifully in her book, Forever Summer. Most of the recipes I try use somewhere between 150-175g per three egg whites, with the exception of Maggie Beer, who goes for 330g, possibly because she\u2019s pairing it with acidic fruit in this particular instance. For a more versatile recipe, however, I\u2019m going to keep the sugar content fairly low. Yotam Ottolenghi and Helen Goh heat the meringue mixture while whisking, more like an Italian meringue, which does indeed give it a beautifully voluminous consistency, but we\u2019ve no complaints about Smith\u2019s version. More important, for a really luscious middle, is not to let it completely dry out in the oven, as you would with crisper meringues \u2013 that \u201cpromise of squidge\u201d is important \u2013 a fairly low temperature is still desirable, however, so it doesn\u2019t caramelise.

You can flavour the meringue with brown sugar, which Ottolenghi and Goh credit for the \u201cgooey, almost toffee-like\u201d consistency of their base.

Yes, it sounds like it might take the joy out of this gloriously indulgent dish, but in fact, the slight tanginess works beautifully to balance the sweetness of the meringue and fruit.

      "body": "<p>When I think of the so-called \u201csummer of chillwave\u201d, I remember sitting at a desk in a giant office in midtown Manhattan, shivering in the air conditioning and listening to songs about the beach. It was June 2009 \u2013 the summer after the sub-prime mortgage collapse had precipitated what was then the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/08/creditcrunch.marketturmoil\">largest single-day point drop</a> in Dow Jones history \u2013 and I was a recent graduate, working an entry-level temp job in the library of a corporate law firm. Whenever I wasn\u2019t helping summer associates (or secretly updating my music blog), I was listening to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xdansEXFjg\">Sun Was High (So Was I),</a> a shoddily recorded love song full of fried guitar chords and easy-breezy rhymes by a little-known Los Angeles rock band called Best Coast fronted by stoner <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BestCoast/status/982328149470883840\">Bethany Cosentino</a>. At a time when I couldn\u2019t stop worrying about the future, its apparent effortlessness was soothing, like a blurred dispatch from an endless teenage beach hang where all you have to worry about is the sand getting in your fries and your crush not returning your texts: \u201cWatched the cars go by / The sun was high / And so was I.\u201d</p> <p>It was the first song to give me that sensation.

It was as though culture was stuck in a feedback loop \u2013 tastemaker flag-planting followed by a music-industry feeding frenzy \u2013 that had become an organism with a will of its own.</p> <p>This was unfortunate, because the chillwave era produced some pretty good music, and its central cast was markedly diverse compared with the white male-dominated indie rock of the time. On his 2009 debut, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/oct/16/neon-india-psychic-chasms-cd-review\">Psychic Chasms</a><em>,</em> Neon Indian (AKA Alan Palomo) established himself as one of his generation\u2019s finest synthesists, pulling quirky but beautiful sounds out of temperamental old machines in a manner that was not entirely serious. Toro y Moi\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYIEhOCx6nA\">Leaving Everywhere</a>, from 2010, wrangled blown-out surf guitar and a classic girl-group stomp into one of the period\u2019s most irresistible pop songs, at once a sharp departure from the classic chillwave sound and an unerring encapsulation of its emotional appeal: \u201cI\u2019m leaving everywhere / To go back home / I need a good heart to keep me well.\u201d</p> <p>Besides, music that uses nostalgic older sounds as its source material doesn\u2019t have to be apolitical. In <a href=\"https://www.thewire.co.uk/issues/306\">August 2009</a>, a month after the original Carles post, the Wire\u2019s David Keenan coined the term \u201chypnagogic pop\u201d to describe a new wave of psychedelia growing out of the American noise scene. According to Keenan, musicians including James Ferraro, Spencer Clark, Ariel Pink, Oneohtrix Point Never, Zola Jesus and even Pocahaunted \u2013 Bethany Cosentino\u2019s other project \u2013 were excavating the trash culture of the 80s and 90s, refashioning the dollar-bin one-hit-wonders and workout video jingles of their youth as the building blocks of a new generational consciousness. Though he stopped short of saying that this \u201cdeliberately misheard and degraded pop\u201d was anti-capitalist, the idea was that these musicians were using these remembered sounds to dream up another world. Or as Clark put it: \u201cTo recognise the essence of the past is to imagine the future.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5d877e1b47424f715122e8f27fa64a6bd2813a64\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5d877e1b47424f715122e8f27fa64a6bd2813a64/0_0_4824_2896/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trash-culture connoisseur \u2026 Oneohtrix Point Never.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trash-culture connoisseur \u2026 Oneohtrix Point Never.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Publicity image from music company</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By the end of 2010, that retreat into the past was beginning to feel as pointless as a pair of vintage glasses from Urban Outfitters. In January 2011, Keenan lamented the rise of chillwave and hypnagogic pop, writing that \u201cin the reductive glare of mainstream media\u201d, the latter had become \u201cshorthand for a cheap form of revivalism and a valorising of bad taste\u201d. His jab at Best Coast for leaving behind Pocahaunted and starting a \u201csimplistically twee-pop group that seems to exist solely to dance to whatever tune her current corporate sponsors \u2013 Converse, Target, Eskuche \u2013 care to call\u201d was pretty cruel, but he wasn\u2019t wrong in thinking that lo-fi music was becoming a piece with the industry to which it once represented an alternative.</p> <p>That same month, Washed Out\u2019s chirpy Feel It All Around became the theme song of IFC hipster-parody show Portlandia.

Over the last decade, we\u2019ve grown a little more inclined to question where that need for escapism comes from, even when it is being sold to us as counterculture. Now we revisit our favourite chillwave songs and ask ourselves who gets to be nostalgic, and what for?</p>",

It was June 2009 \u2013 the summer after the sub-prime mortgage collapse had precipitated what was then the largest single-day point drop in Dow Jones history \u2013 and I was a recent graduate, working an entry-level temp job in the library of a corporate law firm. Whenever I wasn\u2019t helping summer associates (or secretly updating my music blog), I was listening to Sun Was High (So Was I), a shoddily recorded love song full of fried guitar chords and easy-breezy rhymes by a little-known Los Angeles rock band called Best Coast fronted by stoner Bethany Cosentino. At a time when I couldn\u2019t stop worrying about the future, its apparent effortlessness was soothing, like a blurred dispatch from an endless teenage beach hang where all you have to worry about is the sand getting in your fries and your crush not returning your texts: \u201cWatched the cars go by / The sun was high / And so was I.\u201d It was the first song to give me that sensation.

By summer 2011, MTV had launched an indie music web show called Weird Vibes, replete with garish neon animations and a pilot titled It\u2019s Not Easy Being a Buzzband, featuring a two-minute segment titled Don\u2019t Call Me Chillwave. I had begun work as an editor for Altered Zones, a short-lived Pitchfork experiment designed to bring a number of tastemaking mp3 bloggers \u2013 many of whom were covering hypnagogic pop, chillwave and other emergent genres \u2013 under the same roof. It shuttered in late 2011, a sign that blogging about underground music from your bedroom was only ever going to be a labour of love. Eventually the chillwave era evaporated into the ether, though it\u2019s hard to pinpoint exactly when. Some say the end was nigh in February 2011, when Toro y Moi released a second album, Underneath the Pine, recorded entirely with \u201creal instruments\u201d and when Pitchfork dealt a crushing 3.8 album rating to blissed-out Florida producer MillionYoung. For me, it was October of that year, when James Ferraro released Far Side Virtual, a half-joking reclamation of the laptop that sounded so egregiously, deliberately cringeworthy \u2013 Skype sounds, muzak synth melodies and all \u2013 that it made me realise how out-of-hand the whole lo-fi conceit had become. Still, it\u2019s no stretch to say that we\u2019re still hearing the reverberations of that eerily prolonged summer in our headphones. Though critics have called chillwave \u201cthe dying gasp of the blogosphere\u201d, it was also the internet electronic micro-genre that launched a hundred internet electronic micro-genres (think: vaporwave, witch house, seapunk, shitgaze, distroid, hard vapor), not to mention its corollaries in this decade\u2019s internet rap, which largely shared its collagist, hyper-referential approach to sound. Writing for Vice in 2015, Larry Fitzmaurice highlighted chillwave\u2019s convergence with a number of the trends that have come to represent our generation\u2019s \u201coverground alternative music\u201d at large: \u201cAn increased embrace of sampling and electronics, a de-emphasising of guitars \u2026 an unabashed love of all things retro, from Tangerine Dream to fruit punch Gushers, that has defined this decade\u2019s youth as a people that find the present too painful to exist in.\u201d A decade since the recession began, it\u2019s hard not to notice the extent to which that longing for escape has become part of the fabric of everyday life, one where we compulsively post tinted Instagram photos of our last Aperol Spritz bender and listen to Spotify playlists with names like Chill Vibes, Young and Free and Boho and Chill \u2013 not just for fun, but as a means of psychic survival in an increasingly stressful world. Which doesn\u2019t mean chillwave itself has aged particularly well. During a summer filled with non-stop reminders of the children imprisoned in cages at the Mexican border, of state legislatures stripping women of their reproductive rights, of the imminent demise of the very beaches chillwave droned on about, it\u2019s hard to imagine an artist being so celebrated now for writing a song about putting her head in the sand. Over the last decade, we\u2019ve grown a little more inclined to question where that need for escapism comes from, even when it is being sold to us as counterculture. Now we revisit our favourite chillwave songs and ask ourselves who gets to be nostalgic, and what for?",

Worse still, there is not one scientific method; methods and standards of proof are very different as between, say, ethology and nuclear physics. Some sciences are experimental, others (like astronomy) observational.

There have been few figures since Maragaret Thatcher who have polarised politics in quite the same way. Yet, as a criticism, there is something off about it. Should politics not be divisive? Is it not, when you get right down to it, a conflict of opposing forces trying to wrestle power from each other? How did we get to a place where \u201cdivisive\u201d was seen as a criticism rather than a bald statement of simple fact?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/20/jeremy-corbyn-moral-ed-miliband\">If you can\u2019t abide Jeremy Corbyn, learn from the moral of Ed Miliband | Aditya Chakrabortty</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Twenty years ago there was a feeling of consensus across the west\u2019s elite thinkers. The big questions of politics had been solved; there was a right answer after all. Economic growth led to development; development led to the blooming of liberal values; more liberal and open economies were better for growth. The whole thing was a virtuous cycle that could be packaged and exported across the world. Yes, there was the occasional war, or massive terrorist attack, and yes global warming was a looming problem, but those were mere details. The future was bright.</p> <p>And yet, it doesn\u2019t seem to have worked out that way. Tony Blair tried to harness the dynamism of capital to fund a more equitable society, but without structural reform at its foundation the project was washed away like a house built on sand at the first sign of economic crisis. In 2010 the Liberal Democrats, supported by an army of voters who had been sold a promise of a more liberal alternative to Gordon Brown, tried to ally with the Conservatives to moderate them. Five years later those same voters punished them for their folly after the Tories proved inherently immoderable. As much as we believe we can cling to the tiger\u2019s back, there is an inexorable logic to the power of capital that eventually consumes all our attempts to tame it.</p> <p>The promise of the virtuous cycle was not broken by \u201cdivisive\u201d figures \u2013 they have simply exposed it as false. Productivity growth and technological advancement have given us a society with an abundance of resources, and yet Iain Duncan Smith still comes out and tell us there\u2019s nothing in the pot, and you all have to <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/pension-age-rise-iain-duncan-smith-state-centre-for-social-justice-pension-age-75-a9071396.html\" title=\"\">work until you\u2019re 75</a>. People are right to ask where all the wealth has gone, and why there\u2019s nothing left for them. How can we be producing so much more per person than we were 100 years ago, yet still can\u2019t spare any of that surplus even for our retirees?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Corbyn is a divisive figure, but so is Boris Johnson, so were Theresa May and David Cameron, so was Blair</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The answer is that we could, but Iain Duncan Smith does not want to. He prefers to maintain a system where that surplus can be stashed away by the increasingly rarefied financial elite, even though they are already the richest humans to have ever lived. This position is not called \u201cdivisive\u201d, even though it is surely going to prove immensely unpopular. Being divisive does not, under examination, mean causing division, but drawing attention to divisions that already exist.</p> <p>Barack Obama, one of the most conciliatory moderates ever to hold the office of president of the US, was accused of stoking racial divisions. Why? Because his mere existence as a black man put a spotlight on the unhealed wounds and the festering white supremacy that people had chosen to believe were mere relics of the past. The New York Times has been <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/identities/2019/8/19/20812238/1619-project-slavery-conservatives\" title=\"\">accused of being divisive</a> with the publication of its <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/08/14/magazine/1619-america-slavery.html\" title=\"\">1619 project</a>, which examines slavery\u2019s pivotal role in shaping American history, for the same reason.</p> <p>To be divisive is to not let people look away. It is to turn and say to those who have been ignored for being inconvenient: \u201cWe believe you, you\u2019re not making it up, it\u2019s there and it\u2019s real and it\u2019s bad and it should change.\u201d That upsets people who are comfortable with things the way they are \u2013 which is really what divisive means, when it comes down to it.</p> <p>Corbyn is a divisive figure, but so is Boris Johnson, so were Theresa May and David Cameron, so was Blair. It\u2019s just that the people who were divided away by them weren\u2019t considered important. The poor, the \u201cloony left\u201d, the disabled, the foreign \u2013 none of them mattered and so the solid core of people who remained could say: \u201cLook how unified we are, look how we compromise like adults.\u201d But it\u2019s a shallow kind of compromise, where you only ask the people who already broadly agree with you.</p> <p>Corbyn\u2019s divisiveness in this context is what underlies his appeal, and that\u2019s why the calls for him to step aside for a more unifying figure are so tone-deaf. If he were acceptable to the current holders of power in this country, then he wouldn\u2019t be any use to us. </p> <p>Exposing division is not the same as causing it. Eventually we are going to have to stop saying \u201cyou\u2019re dividing us\u201d and start asking: \u201cWhich side do I need to be on?\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Phil McDuff writes on economics and social policy</p>",

Dominic Grieve, in a cautious not-quite-rejection of the plan, referred to Corbyn as a \u201cdeeply divisive figure\u201d. As criticisms go, it is a fair one. There have been few figures since Maragaret Thatcher who have polarised politics in quite the same way. Yet, as a criticism, there is something off about it. Should politics not be divisive? Is it not, when you get right down to it, a conflict of opposing forces trying to wrestle power from each other? How did we get to a place where \u201cdivisive\u201d was seen as a criticism rather than a bald statement of simple fact? Twenty years ago there was a feeling of consensus across the west\u2019s elite thinkers. The big questions of politics had been solved; there was a right answer after all. Economic growth led to development; development led to the blooming of liberal values; more liberal and open economies were better for growth. The whole thing was a virtuous cycle that could be packaged and exported across the world. Yes, there was the occasional war, or massive terrorist attack, and yes global warming was a looming problem, but those were mere details. The future was bright. And yet, it doesn\u2019t seem to have worked out that way. Tony Blair tried to harness the dynamism of capital to fund a more equitable society, but without structural reform at its foundation the project was washed away like a house built on sand at the first sign of economic crisis. In 2010 the Liberal Democrats, supported by an army of voters who had been sold a promise of a more liberal alternative to Gordon Brown, tried to ally with the Conservatives to moderate them. Five years later those same voters punished them for their folly after the Tories proved inherently immoderable. As much as we believe we can cling to the tiger\u2019s back, there is an inexorable logic to the power of capital that eventually consumes all our attempts to tame it. The promise of the virtuous cycle was not broken by \u201cdivisive\u201d figures \u2013 they have simply exposed it as false. Productivity growth and technological advancement have given us a society with an abundance of resources, and yet Iain Duncan Smith still comes out and tell us there\u2019s nothing in the pot, and you all have to work until you\u2019re 75. People are right to ask where all the wealth has gone, and why there\u2019s nothing left for them. How can we be producing so much more per person than we were 100 years ago, yet still can\u2019t spare any of that surplus even for our retirees? The answer is that we could, but Iain Duncan Smith does not want to. He prefers to maintain a system where that surplus can be stashed away by the increasingly rarefied financial elite, even though they are already the richest humans to have ever lived. This position is not called \u201cdivisive\u201d, even though it is surely going to prove immensely unpopular. Being divisive does not, under examination, mean causing division, but drawing attention to divisions that already exist. Barack Obama, one of the most conciliatory moderates ever to hold the office of president of the US, was accused of stoking racial divisions. Why? Because his mere existence as a black man put a spotlight on the unhealed wounds and the festering white supremacy that people had chosen to believe were mere relics of the past. The New York Times has been accused of being divisive with the publication of its 1619 project, which examines slavery\u2019s pivotal role in shaping American history, for the same reason. To be divisive is to not let people look away. It is to turn and say to those who have been ignored for being inconvenient: \u201cWe believe you, you\u2019re not making it up, it\u2019s there and it\u2019s real and it\u2019s bad and it should change.\u201d That upsets people who are comfortable with things the way they are \u2013 which is really what divisive means, when it comes down to it. Corbyn is a divisive figure, but so is Boris Johnson, so were Theresa May and David Cameron, so was Blair. It\u2019s just that the people who were divided away by them weren\u2019t considered important. The poor, the \u201cloony left\u201d, the disabled, the foreign \u2013 none of them mattered and so the solid core of people who remained could say: \u201cLook how unified we are, look how we compromise like adults.\u201d But it\u2019s a shallow kind of compromise, where you only ask the people who already broadly agree with you. Corbyn\u2019s divisiveness in this context is what underlies his appeal, and that\u2019s why the calls for him to step aside for a more unifying figure are so tone-deaf. If he were acceptable to the current holders of power in this country, then he wouldn\u2019t be any use to us. Exposing division is not the same as causing it. Eventually we are going to have to stop saying \u201cyou\u2019re dividing us\u201d and start asking: \u201cWhich side do I need to be on?\u201d \u2022 Phil McDuff writes on economics and social policy",

By the time I began reading and rereading for this list my own pre-emptive grieving was well under way. It changed how I experienced the stories; I was startled by the comfort they offered. Certainly my tears were closer to the surface than when I had first encountered these texts, but I felt grateful when the tears came, grateful that the words could pull me outside of my own sadness and into empathy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/aug/22/say-say-say-by-lila-savage-review\">Say Say Say by Lila Savage review \u2013 a luminous debut</a> </p> </aside>  <p>These caregiving narratives have survival tools embedded in them: humour, anger, beauty and poignant joy. They aren\u2019t all loss and decline, though those very human experiences deserve all the artistry that writers can muster. A sense of redemption and awe remains possible within the scope of describing tragedy, and wryness or rage can thwart impulses towards cloying sentiment or \u201clife lessons\u201d. And then there is the magic of having your very private experience captured in language.</p> <p>But these stories aren\u2019t only gifts to those who are grieving. They illuminate the experiencing of caring and being cared for, whether as the children we once were or as the vulnerable adults we may yet become. Their focus is not loss.

      "bodyText": "Shortly before the publication of my first novel, I learned that my mother\u2019s cancer had returned. I am not yet her caregiver but I have cared for folks with cancer before \u2013 and Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s and other afflictions, mostly of old age. I worked as a professional companion for elderly people for nearly nine years before I began writing about my caregiving work in the form of Say Say Say \u2013 the story of young woman who cares for a woman with a brain injury, and the complex intimacies that emerge within her family as she declines. During that time I thought about why people might want to read work on difficult or dark subjects, but it was largely an abstract consideration. By the time I began reading and rereading for this list my own pre-emptive grieving was well under way. It changed how I experienced the stories; I was startled by the comfort they offered. Certainly my tears were closer to the surface than when I had first encountered these texts, but I felt grateful when the tears came, grateful that the words could pull me outside of my own sadness and into empathy. These caregiving narratives have survival tools embedded in them: humour, anger, beauty and poignant joy. They aren\u2019t all loss and decline, though those very human experiences deserve all the artistry that writers can muster. A sense of redemption and awe remains possible within the scope of describing tragedy, and wryness or rage can thwart impulses towards cloying sentiment or \u201clife lessons\u201d. And then there is the magic of having your very private experience captured in language. But these stories aren\u2019t only gifts to those who are grieving. They illuminate the experiencing of caring and being cared for, whether as the children we once were or as the vulnerable adults we may yet become. Their focus is not loss. It\u2019s the sometimes messy but often life-affirming help that people can offer one another. 1. Purple America by Rick Moody \u201cWhosoever knows the folds and complexities of his mother\u2019s body, he shall never die.\u201d Thus we are introduced to Hex Raitliff, the primary caregiver for his 70-year-old mother Billie, who suffers from a neurological disease similar to MS. What follows is an incredibly poetic description of bathing her, a breathtaking opening to an unusually masculine take on caregiving. 2. The Bear Came Over the Mountain by Alice Munro Grant and Fiona have been married for many years when Fiona develops Alzheimer\u2019s disease. On the day Grant moves her into a nursing home, \u201cshe was talking about the time that they had gone out skiing at night under the full moon and over the black-striped snow, in this place that you could get into only in the depths of winter. They had heard the branches cracking in the cold. So if she could remember that so vividly and correctly, could there really be so much the matter with her? It was all he could do not to turn around and drive home.\u201d 3. Eileen by Ottessa Moshfegh In this macabre and funny novel, Eileen tends to her alcoholic father. \u201cOnce, after a good six-day absence, a bender of greater proportions than I had ever seen my father go on, I got a call from a hospital two counties over and drove out there to pick him up. That persuaded me to gather up all his shoes and keep them locked in the trunk of the car from then on.\u201d A bracing balance to more tender caregiving narratives, we bear witness to codependency, resentment and other dark feelings. 4. Family Life by Akhil Sharma Caregiving through the eyes of a child: Ajay is the younger brother of Birju, a high-achieving teenager who becomes severely brain-damaged after a diving accident. A raw, sensitive story of an immigrant family grieving. \u201c\u2018Why don\u2019t you make Birju like he was?\u2019 As soon as I asked the question, God stopped feeling real.

This year\u2019s match was won by the blow-ins but only after the odds had been sufficiently stacked against the residents by loading the field with almost twice as many players on the visiting team. \u201cThe island lads and the Turkfest crew all mixing together and having a bit of fun \u2013 it\u2019s great,\u201d says Robert, who lives on the island and is responsible for purifying the drinking water. Turkfest comes to a close on the Sunday evening with the spectacle of road boules. Two teams comprised of a mix of islanders and visitors compete to see which can throw a boule around the distance of the island\u2019s only road in the fewest possible throws. Islander Brendon O\u2019Toole says \u2018\u2018Turkfest is brilliant. It\u2019s a long winter and you can see here how happy the locals are to have these people here.\u201d Turkfester James says: \u2018\u2018The islanders are not only hosting us, they\u2019re also the life and soul of the party.\u201d Festivalgoers dance in the Tale of the Tongs, a pavilion installed on the island by an American sculptor and architecture students in 2013 The festivalgoers are part a growing trend of respectful tourism that seeks to leave no trace that that they were ever on the island. This philosophy ensures there is mutual appreciation between the partygoers and the residents. Eamon says that after the guests leave, \u201cthe island is exactly as it was \u2026 as if nothing has happened.\u201d Though the island faces difficulties in terms of sustaining its population, the islanders continue to believe that \u201ctourism gives a chance for other people to come, as well as creating jobs to keep people here\u201d. Stephen Young, who works remotely as a graphic designer, says of his experience moving to the island with his wife Maggie from Bath in 2015: \u201cInishturk is a small community with a big heart, you will find no better welcome anywhere.\u201d With a steady flow of Woofers, foreign nationals and seasonal workers, there are reasons to believe that this beautiful island will continue to provide a home to people for generations to come. For now though, the islanders need a chance to recuperate. Mary Anne O\u2019Toole, who hosts Turkfesters, says \u201cafter the storm, there is a calm \u2013 and a big one\u201d. \u2022 The next Turkfest is in June 2021. Tickets cost \u20ac135 to non-islanders, which includes access to music, classes and workshops; other activities cost extra. O\u2019Malley Ferries operates daily all-year round between Inishturk and Roonagh pier, which is 6km from Louisburgh, Co Mayo. From 1 May to 30 September, it operates two daily crossings in each direction, full fare \u20ac22 return, students \u20ac16 and children 5-18 \u20ac11, under fives and pensioners with Irish travel pass free, pensioner without travel pass \u20ac16 Looking for a holiday with a difference?

You have Hindus and you have the Muslims and I wouldn\u2019t say they get along so great,\u201d Trump said at the White House. \u201cI will do the best I can to mediate.\u201d Delhi maintains that the revocation of Kashmir\u2019s special status is an internal matter but its actions have prompted fierce anger from Pakistan. Last week, Pakistan\u2019s prime minister, Imran Khan, threatened to \u201cteach Delhi a lesson\u201d and vowed to fight until the end against any Indian violations in disputed Kashmir. In a further sign of escalating tensions on Wednesday, Pakistan said three of its civilians died as a result of Indian gunfire from across the heavily militarised line of control that divides the territory. Indian officials said one of its soldiers died and four were wounded after fire from Pakistani troops along the de-facto border, according to the Press Trust of India news agency. Delhi, which has always refused third-party mediation over Kashmir, accuses Pakistan of fuelling terrorist activity in the region. Kashmir police said a man who they said was affiliated with Lashkar-e-Taiba, a Pakistan-based militant group, was killed in an operation by security teams in Baramulla, northern Kashmir. One officer was also killed and another was receiving hospital treatment. The suspected militant is not believed to have been a prominent figure in LeT, which is designated a terrorist organisation by the UN and has been blamed by the US and India for the Mumbai attacks in 2008, which killed more than 160 people. Khalid Shah, an associate fellow at the Observer Research Foundation, an Indian-based thinktank, said it was unlikely officials would pursue high-profile militants as their deaths would risk attracting large funeral crowds. Clashes are common between Indian security forces and militants in Kashmir, where an insurgency has been fought against Indian rule for decades. However, such actions appeared to have halted after the revocation of Kashmir\u2019s special status, and officials were focused on maintaining law and order by enforcing a strict curfew. \u201cFor two weeks the government deliberately didn\u2019t conduct any operations and now there is a clear indication that they want to have an aggressive security stance against the militant groups and to make sure they are on the defensive,\u201d Shah said. Restrictions on movement have been eased and landlines restored in many areas, but mobile phone and internet services remain blocked. Some schools reopened on Monday but most families kept their children at home, fearing violence. The Indian government said its decision to remove Kashmir\u2019s special status would stimulate development and prevent terrorism. However, major resistance is expected in the region. Despite heavy security, demonstrations have been held against the decision. Thousands of people have reportedly been arrested, including activists, lawyers and business owners, apparently to prevent unrest. The revocation of Kashmir\u2019s special status strips it of any autonomy, removing its constitution and rules that have prevented outsiders from buying land in the territory, India\u2019s only Muslim-majority state. Pakistan, which has long sought to internationalise the Kashmir dispute, has previously welcomed Trump\u2019s offer to broker the matter. On Tuesday, it said it would take the issue to the international court of justice.",

      "bodyText": "Subscribe now to receive the morning briefing by email. Good morning, I\u2019m Tim Walker with today\u2019s essential stories. Trump turns to antisemitic trope in attack on Omar and Tlaib Donald Trump has accused Jewish Americans who vote for Democrats of showing \u201ceither a total lack of knowledge or great disloyalty,\u201d apparently suggesting Jewish Americans have dual loyalty to the US and Israel \u2013 a perception widely considered antisemitic. The president\u2019s remarks came as part of a fresh attack on the Muslim congresswomen Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib, critics of the Israeli government, which recently barred them from visiting the West Bank. Greenland spat. Trump has cancelled a planned trip to Denmark after the Danish prime minister described the US president\u2019s widely ridiculed desire to purchase Greenland as \u201cabsurd\u201d. Police have thwarted six attacks since El Paso and Dayton A little over two weeks since the country was shaken by the mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton, Ohio, law enforcement officials say they have already foiled six more separate mass shootings or white supremacist attacks across the US. Four of the foiled plots appeared to involve men espousing far-right views, with online posts targeting LGBTQ people, Jewish people, African Americans, Latinos and Muslims. And four of the six suspects were white men in their 20s, with all but one thought to be armed. Background checks. Immediately after El Paso, Trump promised \u201cmeaningful\u201d legislation to introduce \u201cintelligent background checks\u201d. But the president has once again walked back his gun control stance, citing \u201cvery strong\u201d existing laws. Maduro admits months of secret US-Venezuela talks Venezuela\u2019s leader, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, has confirmed his regime has been holding secret talks with the Trump White House for several months amid his country\u2019s continuing economic, political and humanitarian meltdown, which has been exacerbated by US sanctions. The admission came after reports in the US media that Diosdado Cabello, the head of Venezuela\u2019s pro-Maduro assembly, had been engaged in \u201csecret communications\u201d with Trump officials. Internal strife? Despite rumours of infighting at the heart of his regime \u2013 and its battle for survival against the opposition movement led by Juan Guaid\u00f3 \u2013 Maduro insisted the talks had occurred with his \u201cexpress and direct permission\u201d. Ethics questions over interior secretary\u2019s gas project role The US interior secretary, David Bernhardt, may have violated the Trump administration\u2019s own ethics guidelines by promoting a fossil fuel project backed by his former employer, the lobbying firm Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck. Emails obtained by the Guardian suggest Bernhardt met in March with officials from Colorado and discussed a fracking pipeline proposed by the Canadian energy giant Pembina, which would pass through interior department land. Draining the swamp? The Trump administration\u2019s ethics rules, supposedly designed to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d, say officials must recuse themselves from issues involving a former client for at least two years after they join the administration. Crib sheet The Australian cardinal George Pell has lost an appeal against his conviction for child sexual abuse, meaning he remains the most senior Catholic cleric to be jailed for such crimes. The Trump administration has approved the $8bn sale of 66 F-16 fighter jets to Taiwan, in a move expected to anger Beijing, which considers Taiwan a part of China awaiting reunification. A study of violinists has found merely good players practised as much as, or more than, better players, leaving factors such as teaching or natural talent to account for the difference \u2013 and apparently debunking the so-called 10,000-hour rule. Spider-Man looks set to exit the Marvel Cinematic Universe, after negotiations broke down over the deal that allows the web-slinger \u2013 whose screen rights are controlled by Sony \u2013 to appear alongside the Avengers in the Disney-produced series. Must-reads Growing violence and gang rule at a Mississippi prison Last year Trump hailed Mississippi for reforms it had put in place to reduce the prison population, by providing job training and rehabilitation. But the reality is starkly different, finds Jerry Mitchell of the Mississippi Center for Investigative Reporting: the number of inmates is growing, and violence and gangs are on the rise. The comfort TV era: why everyone is watching sitcom reruns We live in an age of prestige television, with an endless selection of lavishly produced shows from Mindhunter to The Crown. So why are so many people using Netflix to watch Friends on a loop instead? Richard Godwin explores the popularity of \u201cnon-event TV\u201d. Youngstown, Ohio becomes a city without a newspaper For 150 years, the Vindicator newspaper of Youngstown, Ohio, has battled powerful foes from the Ku Klux Klan to the mafia. But it has at last lost its fight with wider economic forces, announcing it is to close at the end of August. That will leave Youngstown as the largest city in the US without a major newspaper, as Adam Gabbatt reports. Do you know how much time you spend on your phone? Adrienne Matei spends an average of two hours and 20 minutes per day on her phone, which seemed OK for someone who writes about the internet. Until, that is, she calculated it was more than a month per year. She asks the experts how we can reclaim our screen time. Opinion A recent study suggests 45% of Americans wear the same pair of underpants for two days or more. But this wasn\u2019t peer-reviewed scientific research, it was a survey by an underwear company. If the old undies stink, then so do the statistics, says Arwa Mahdawi. I can tell you from my own experience in the ad industry that agencies are full of people desperately designing surveys and cutting data until they generate a juicy statistic for a client. I call these types of stats \u201cadvertistics\u201d. Sport Hammer thrower Gwen Berry and fencer Race Imboden have each been given a 12-month probation for protesting on the medals stand at the Pan American Games. But in letters of reprimand to the athletes, the US Olympic Committee signaled it would not be so lenient to others considering similar protests at the 2020 Games in Tokyo. MLS is the only North American sports league to have banned its supporters from making political statements at matches. But its struggle to stifle Antifa, the militant anti-fascist group, suggests enforcing the ban is not so easy, writes Graham Ruthven.

      "bodyText": "Praise from a former top defender was much appreciated by Jayne Ludlow, particularly given that the Wales Women\u2019s manager and her staff are stretched across all the national team\u2019s age groups. Ludlow\u2019s tactical nous was singled out by Danny Gabbidon, who won 49 caps for Wales and was the guest speaker at the launch of the Football Association of Wales\u2019 new identity for women\u2019s football, Be.Football. The former Cardiff and West Ham player also spoke of the enjoyment that following the women\u2019s team had given him. \u201cThe senior national team is a priority but it takes up only a quarter of our job,\u201d Ludlow says. \u201cSo when we get praise from Danny about getting things right tactically, it\u2019s fantastic for all our staff. I think from an individual perspective and a staff perspective it would be nice for people to understand the difficulties we have.\u201d Spreading themselves thin is something the coaching staff will be confronted with again next month. \u201cI\u2019m thankful that we\u2019re developing and growing in all areas,\u201d Ludlow says. \u201cGoing into September we have the under-17 Uefa tournament and an under-19 Uefa tournament. The under-19 games run at the same time as the seniors and we have one group of staff. We want to be successful in all our roles, we want our youth team doing well, we want them pushing because that\u2019s our future senior team.

Founded as \u2018Forest Football Club\u2019 in 1859, they changed their name to Wanderers in 1863. The were giants of the Victorian amateur era who won the FA Cup on five occasions in the 1870s (72, 73, 76, 77 and 78) and there are three reasons for nominating Wanderers:</p> <p>\u201c1)<strong> </strong>Their name reflects their lack of a fixed home ground; for much of their history they were a travelling team who accepted challenges to play at their opponents\u2019 grounds (though they did sort of settle on the Oval as a semi-permanent home from 1869). So anyone who wanted to see Wanderers play in their \u2018wandering\u2019 period would have been forced to follow them playing away.</p> <p>\u201c2) In the era of the stiff-upper-lip amateur gentleman player, they drew their players from multiple public schools; one of the reasons for their rapid decline in the 1880s was the formation of multiple Old Boys teams, splintering Wanderers\u2019 player base. So they would have drawn support from multiple public school old boys, regardless of where they were playing.</p> <p>\u201c3) They played in the first-ever international club match, losing 5-0 to Queen\u2019s Park at Hampden in 1875. I can\u2019t find figures proving there was any away support at this match, but it seems likely. The match drew a crowd of over 11,000 \u2013 the largest crowd at that point to have watched a match in Scotland \u2013 and the programme charmingly asked that attendees \u2018please do not strain the ropes\u2019. So if nothing else, it seems likely that they had the first <em>international</em> away following.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>All this, of course, depends how many constitutes a <em>following</em>. Does distance travelled matter as well? If we want to be specific, Andrew Wright has a suggestion: \u201cIf the criteria are eg a five-figure number travelling 100-plus miles, I\u2019ll suggest the 15,000-plus with Manchester City at the 1904 FA Cup final, played at Crystal Palace in London. That year saw the first all-Lancashire final, City v Bolton. The newspapers said half the 61,374 crowd travelled from the north, with many sleeping on the platforms at St Pancras and Euston the night before the game.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"50a6a2b75f42c8a8e955c0bcdee33acac2020c3b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/50a6a2b75f42c8a8e955c0bcdee33acac2020c3b/0_0_2088_1367/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The winners of the 1904 FA Cup final, Manchester City.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"655\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The winners of the 1904 FA Cup final, Manchester City.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"55e4deb7e130f1d024beb6ff167472cb9c8a3fc4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/55e4deb7e130f1d024beb6ff167472cb9c8a3fc4/0_0_385_304/385.jpg\" alt=\"A poster encouraging fans to travel to the final by train.\" width=\"385\" height=\"304\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A poster encouraging fans to travel to the final by train.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public Domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cNo doubt there were Bolton fans among them, but it\u2019s probable they were the minority as Wanderers were a Division Two team at the time. Top-tier City had the advantage of an ally in the Great Central Railway, who put on the first ever supporters\u2019 special trains, and advertised them with a poster showing the City hero of the time, and the slogan <em>Billy Meredith secures the Cup. He wants you to see the match and travel in comfort \u2026</em></p> <p>\u201cSerendipitously, City won 1-0 with a goal from Meredith. The National Football Museum used to have this poster on display; they even worked out that it correctly predicted which end of the ground Meredith would score.\u201d</p> <h2>Rising star</h2> <p><strong>\u201cSheffield United\u2019s John Lundstram has now scored a league goal in each of England\u2019s top four tiers,\u201d </strong>writes Tom Ayres, <strong>\u201cwith 10 across the four divisions. Has anyone achieved this with fewer goals?\u201d</strong></p> <p>Yes. Jimmy Willis bagged for Darlington \u2013 for whom he played between 1988 and 1991 \u2013 in Division Four, before signing for Leicester. He then went on loan to Bradford, scoring once for them in Division Three, returned to Leicester, and added goals in Divisions Two and One, the last of which was his ninth.</p> <p>It\u2019s also worth mentioning Steve Finnan, the first player to score in England\u2019s top five divisions. He started in the Conference with Welling United, then skipped to what is now the Championship, netting for Birmingham, before filling in the lower-league gaps with Notts County and completing the feat with Liverpool. Since then, Gary Hooper has done likewise, opening his account in the various divisions with Grays Athletic, Southend, Hereford United and Norwich \u2013 and in between times, scoring for Celtic in the Scottish Premiership.</p> <h2>British and Irish Lions</h2> <p><strong>\u201cAn excellent start to the season for Sheffield United,\u201d</strong> begins Robert Farmey. <strong>\u201cIt\u2019s worth looking at their starting XI lineups over the past two games which have contained only British and Irish nationalities. When was the last time this was achieved in the Premier League?\u201d</strong></p> <p>You must be forgetting the existence of Sean Dyche, Robert. Only last season, on Boxing Day, Dyche picked the following Burnley side: Hart; Lowton, Tarkowski, Mee, Gibson, Taylor; Westwood, Cork, Hendrick; Vokes, Barnes. Of course, Ashley Barnes played an Under-20 game for Austria in 2008, but remains from Bath. The British-Irish connection didn\u2019t help Burnley, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/dec/26/burnley-everton-premier-league-match-report\">they lost 5-1 at home to Everton</a>.</p> <p>And here\u2019s Wouter van Dael on a slight tangent into Belgium:<strong> \u201c</strong>When Jean-Marc Guillou (of 1978 World Cup fame) was hired as manager of KSK Beveren in 2001, he immediately took to importing players from the academy he had helped found, L\u2019Acad\u00e9mie de Sol Beni in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. Although he was fired a year later, several coaches after him continued this tradition. This brings us to <a href=\"https://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/season=2004/matches/round=1975/match=79610/index.html\">16 September 2004</a>, when Beveren fielded an all-Ivorian XI (including Emmanuel Ebou\u00e9) in their Uefa Cup match against Levski Sofia.

      "bodyText": "\u201cWhich team had the first away following in football?\u201d tweets @djgcfum. Here\u2019s Alasdair Brooks with quite an answer: \u201cThis is difficult, given the lack of verifiable records for the formative period of football, and the difficulty of deciding what constitutes \u2018football\u2019 (assuming that the question means \u2018association football\u2019) before the formal codification of a single set of rules, and deciding what constitutes an \u2018away following\u2019 in the 19th century. \u201cAll those qualifiers aside, I\u2019ll put in a vote for the original Wanderers FC (1859-87), winners of the first-ever FA Cup in 1872. Founded as \u2018Forest Football Club\u2019 in 1859, they changed their name to Wanderers in 1863. The were giants of the Victorian amateur era who won the FA Cup on five occasions in the 1870s (72, 73, 76, 77 and 78) and there are three reasons for nominating Wanderers: \u201c1) Their name reflects their lack of a fixed home ground; for much of their history they were a travelling team who accepted challenges to play at their opponents\u2019 grounds (though they did sort of settle on the Oval as a semi-permanent home from 1869). So anyone who wanted to see Wanderers play in their \u2018wandering\u2019 period would have been forced to follow them playing away. \u201c2) In the era of the stiff-upper-lip amateur gentleman player, they drew their players from multiple public schools; one of the reasons for their rapid decline in the 1880s was the formation of multiple Old Boys teams, splintering Wanderers\u2019 player base. So they would have drawn support from multiple public school old boys, regardless of where they were playing. \u201c3) They played in the first-ever international club match, losing 5-0 to Queen\u2019s Park at Hampden in 1875. I can\u2019t find figures proving there was any away support at this match, but it seems likely. The match drew a crowd of over 11,000 \u2013 the largest crowd at that point to have watched a match in Scotland \u2013 and the programme charmingly asked that attendees \u2018please do not strain the ropes\u2019. So if nothing else, it seems likely that they had the first international away following.\u201d All this, of course, depends how many constitutes a following. Does distance travelled matter as well? If we want to be specific, Andrew Wright has a suggestion: \u201cIf the criteria are eg a five-figure number travelling 100-plus miles, I\u2019ll suggest the 15,000-plus with Manchester City at the 1904 FA Cup final, played at Crystal Palace in London. That year saw the first all-Lancashire final, City v Bolton. The newspapers said half the 61,374 crowd travelled from the north, with many sleeping on the platforms at St Pancras and Euston the night before the game. \u201cNo doubt there were Bolton fans among them, but it\u2019s probable they were the minority as Wanderers were a Division Two team at the time. Top-tier City had the advantage of an ally in the Great Central Railway, who put on the first ever supporters\u2019 special trains, and advertised them with a poster showing the City hero of the time, and the slogan Billy Meredith secures the Cup. He wants you to see the match and travel in comfort \u2026 \u201cSerendipitously, City won 1-0 with a goal from Meredith. The National Football Museum used to have this poster on display; they even worked out that it correctly predicted which end of the ground Meredith would score.\u201d Rising star \u201cSheffield United\u2019s John Lundstram has now scored a league goal in each of England\u2019s top four tiers,\u201d writes Tom Ayres, \u201cwith 10 across the four divisions. Has anyone achieved this with fewer goals?\u201d Yes. Jimmy Willis bagged for Darlington \u2013 for whom he played between 1988 and 1991 \u2013 in Division Four, before signing for Leicester. He then went on loan to Bradford, scoring once for them in Division Three, returned to Leicester, and added goals in Divisions Two and One, the last of which was his ninth. It\u2019s also worth mentioning Steve Finnan, the first player to score in England\u2019s top five divisions. He started in the Conference with Welling United, then skipped to what is now the Championship, netting for Birmingham, before filling in the lower-league gaps with Notts County and completing the feat with Liverpool. Since then, Gary Hooper has done likewise, opening his account in the various divisions with Grays Athletic, Southend, Hereford United and Norwich \u2013 and in between times, scoring for Celtic in the Scottish Premiership. British and Irish Lions \u201cAn excellent start to the season for Sheffield United,\u201d begins Robert Farmey. \u201cIt\u2019s worth looking at their starting XI lineups over the past two games which have contained only British and Irish nationalities. When was the last time this was achieved in the Premier League?\u201d You must be forgetting the existence of Sean Dyche, Robert. Only last season, on Boxing Day, Dyche picked the following Burnley side: Hart; Lowton, Tarkowski, Mee, Gibson, Taylor; Westwood, Cork, Hendrick; Vokes, Barnes. Of course, Ashley Barnes played an Under-20 game for Austria in 2008, but remains from Bath. The British-Irish connection didn\u2019t help Burnley, they lost 5-1 at home to Everton. And here\u2019s Wouter van Dael on a slight tangent into Belgium: \u201cWhen Jean-Marc Guillou (of 1978 World Cup fame) was hired as manager of KSK Beveren in 2001, he immediately took to importing players from the academy he had helped found, L\u2019Acad\u00e9mie de Sol Beni in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. Although he was fired a year later, several coaches after him continued this tradition. This brings us to 16 September 2004, when Beveren fielded an all-Ivorian XI (including Emmanuel Ebou\u00e9) in their Uefa Cup match against Levski Sofia. What\u2019s more, all 11 players were from the city of Abidjan. It should be noted this only lasted until the seventh minute, when injured goalkeeper Boubacar Barry was replaced by German-born Mark Volders. Knowledge archive \u201cThere\u2019s a buzz in the local blogosphere that an Indonesian coin was used by Jack Taylor, the Englishman who refereed the 1974 World Cup final between Holland and West Germany. Why? Why? Why?\u201d pleaded Ujang Salemba back in August 2006. Reader Anthony Knight was all over this one. \u201cJack Taylor used the coin for the game as it had been specially crafted by the Indonesian mint \u2013 only three were made, one of which was presented to Taylor for his services to football and it was very heavy.\u201d There\u2019s even a picture of it on this website, if that floats your boat.

      "bodyText": "Stephen Fry is lying prostrate on the stage. It\u2019s a pretext for telling the story of Odysseus, washed up on the shore and lying naked (he spares us the nudity), but there\u2019s also a joke. The former QI frontman is now five and a half hours into his three-part show, with more than two hours to come, and he\u2019s pretending to be exhausted. But nothing of the kind. Fry is his same unflappable self at the end of this adaptation of his bestselling retellings of the ancient Greek myths as he was at the start. He remains jovial, avuncular and head-spinningly capable of retaining the details of whole families of gods, heroes and men. Whenever a character has six children, he\u2019ll be sure to namecheck them all. In one section responding to audience questions, he says he\u2019d have loved to have done four or five shows \u2013 and you don\u2019t doubt him. Curiously for a show littered with etymological asides, he uses the word marathon only once \u2013 and for the purpose of making a joke about distance. But a marathon this is \u2013 a Herculean task even, or, as some might argue, a Sisyphean task because it\u2019s not certain the rewards you get out are equal to the effort put in.

The Rail Delivery Group (RDG), the industry body that represents private train operators as well as Network Rail, has admitted that tickets inspectors have overcharged fare-dodgers to the tune of tens of thousands of pounds after rail companies failed to implement a rule change introduced in April 2018. The RDG said eight rail firms had failed to implement the new rules, which reduced the financial punishment for some travellers caught ticketless depending on the time of their journey. Up to 10,000 passengers could have been affected by the mistake \u2013 which was discovered only last month \u2013 through overcharging by Chiltern Railways, Govia Thameslink Railway, Great Western Railway, Greater Anglia, Northern, Southeastern, South Western Railway and London Northwestern. \u201cWhen people haven\u2019t paid to travel, it\u2019s important for train companies to take a firm but fair approach because fare-dodging denies the railway around \u00a3200m a year, which could otherwise be invested to improve services for all passengers,\u201d a spokesman for RDG said. \u201cPeople who have been charged a penalty fare shouldn\u2019t be overcharged, though.\u201d RDG said that about half of the people affected would be issued refunds for the amount they were overcharged but in many cases the train companies do not have the full contact details of those penalised.

Posters will go up in stations over the coming weeks highlighting the situation and asking anyone who thinks they may have been overcharged to contact their train company. On routes where penalty fares apply, passengers must buy a ticket before boarding a train at stations where there is an open ticket office or a functioning ticket machine. If a ticket inspector catches anyone who avoids doing this, they can issue them with a penalty fare notice. These are also given to passengers unable to produce a railcard after buying a discounted ticket, travelling in first class with a standard ticket or staying on a train beyond the destination paid for. Penalty fares are \u00a320 or twice the appropriate single fare, whichever is higher. The single fare was previously based on the price of a ticket valid at any time of day. However, since April last year the price of off-peak fares should be applied if the tickets were available for the journey taken.",

      "body": "<p>You may have noticed that socks aren\u2019t what they used to be. Think back: for a long time socks were just something you used to cover your feet. Possibly black, probably ankle-height and definitely an afterthought. Socks are now an important part of your outfit at the least, the making of an outfit at most.</p> <p>Socks have become an area of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/27/fashion/socks-justin-trudeau-canada.html\" title=\"\">diplomacy and woke-signalling</a> \u2013 the Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau is perhaps the biggest name to use socks in this way, choosing pointedly themed ones for public occasions.

In 2017, kicked off by the Vetements\u2019 socks with the DHL logo teeT-shirt, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/jul/10/footsie-100-why-socks-have-become-the-latest-menswear-battleground\" title=\"\">they</a> became \u201cthe most loaded accessory of the year\u201d, according to the GQ columnist Justin Myers. Prada played with pulling socks up to men\u2019s knees and, thanks to logomania, socks have become a more affordable way for fashion fans to conspicuously buy into their favourite designer labels.</p> <p>If none of this is ringing any bells, then it might mean it\u2019s time to reassess your sock game. This is where the rules come in, because, <a href=\"https://14tothefullest.wordpress.com/2017/06/22/rules-control-the-fun-why-monica-from-friends-was-right/\" title=\"\">in the words of Monica Geller from Friends</a>: \u201cRules help control the fun.\u201d <em>EVB</em></p> <h2><strong>What kind of socks should I be wearing now?</strong></h2> <p>What kind of socks would you like to wear? Given the proliferation of styles, there is a good sock option for everyone. According to the stylist Bemi Shaw, you can never go wrong with a sports sock. \u201cThey add a bit of edge to a basic outfit and make streetwear look more authentic.\u201d</p> <p>A Matisse-bright pair, like you\u2019ll find at Arket, is an easy way to elevate a thrown-on outfit. At John Lewis, according to Elena Bergonzi, a fashion accessories buyer, classic sport socks are proving popular, \u201cbut also glitter and animal prints for the fashion-forward customer\u201d. <em>EVB</em></p> <h2><strong>Is it ever OK to wear socks with sandals?</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8c52587b8493f225311e2e1da0a4112fbec7a68f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8c52587b8493f225311e2e1da0a4112fbec7a68f/0_0_2598_3898/666.jpg\" alt=\"Socks with sandals at the Sies Marjan show, Paris Men\u2019s fashion week, Spring/Summer 2020\" width=\"666\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Socks with sandals at the Sies Marjan show, Paris Men\u2019s fashion week, spring/summer 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Estrop/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To this, the answer is a definite: Yes. But again, make clear it is deliberate. As the sock-styling expert and Man Repeller journalist <a href=\"https://www.manrepeller.com/2019/04/socks-and-sandals-summer.html\" title=\"\">Harling Ross</a><a href=\"https://www.manrepeller.com/2019/04/socks-and-sandals-summer.html\" title=\"\"> has noted</a>, explicit coordination makes it clear that any unusual use of accessories is intentional. If you\u2019re feeling a bit hesitant, see the sophisticated version of the socks and sandals look as touted at the most recent Agnona show. Socks were paired with sandals of the same shade or just a little different; a subtler way to dip a toe. Or, one step up: <a href=\"https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2020-menswear/sies-marjan/slideshow/collection#20\" title=\"\">look to the styling of duck-egg-blue socks with navy-blue sandals</a> at spring/summer 2020 Sies Marjan menswear show. <em>EVB</em></p> <h2><strong>Should I wear my socks pulled up?</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"74e5bd2980ec22adbaa612812ad2052927969a97\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/74e5bd2980ec22adbaa612812ad2052927969a97/0_0_3558_5337/667.jpg\" alt=\"Pull your socks up: worn with suspenders at London Fashion Week Men\u2019s, 2018\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Socks worn with suspenders at London fashion week men\u2019s, 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Edward Berthelot/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIs there another way to wear your socks?\u201d Shaw asks. For her, pulling them up \u201clooks the best but also avoids the awkward bunching that can look like cankles\u201d.</p> <p>There\u2019s an easy sartorial win to be had for men in shorts and sports socks just by pulling them up \u2013 but be sure to look like you mean it. Charlie Teasdale, Esquire\u2019s style director, also thinks socks should be pulled up \u201cin any vaguely formal situation\u201d \u2013 he even suggests, \u201cif you were so inclined\u201d, investing in some sock suspenders. <em>EVB</em></p> <h2><strong>Is it </strong><strong>OK to wear white socks?</strong></h2> <p>Yes and no.

      "bodyText": "You may have noticed that socks aren\u2019t what they used to be. Think back: for a long time socks were just something you used to cover your feet. Possibly black, probably ankle-height and definitely an afterthought. Socks are now an important part of your outfit at the least, the making of an outfit at most. Socks have become an area of diplomacy and woke-signalling \u2013 the Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau is perhaps the biggest name to use socks in this way, choosing pointedly themed ones for public occasions. Or a telling insight into a political mind: Boris Johnson was criticised recently for not washing his lucky socks, emblazoned with a ruler of the Neo-Assyrian empire King Ashurbanipal, often enough. In fashion, statement socks have been big for a few years. In 2017, kicked off by the Vetements\u2019 socks with the DHL logo teeT-shirt, they became \u201cthe most loaded accessory of the year\u201d, according to the GQ columnist Justin Myers. Prada played with pulling socks up to men\u2019s knees and, thanks to logomania, socks have become a more affordable way for fashion fans to conspicuously buy into their favourite designer labels. If none of this is ringing any bells, then it might mean it\u2019s time to reassess your sock game. This is where the rules come in, because, in the words of Monica Geller from Friends: \u201cRules help control the fun.\u201d EVB What kind of socks should I be wearing now? What kind of socks would you like to wear? Given the proliferation of styles, there is a good sock option for everyone. According to the stylist Bemi Shaw, you can never go wrong with a sports sock. \u201cThey add a bit of edge to a basic outfit and make streetwear look more authentic.\u201d A Matisse-bright pair, like you\u2019ll find at Arket, is an easy way to elevate a thrown-on outfit. At John Lewis, according to Elena Bergonzi, a fashion accessories buyer, classic sport socks are proving popular, \u201cbut also glitter and animal prints for the fashion-forward customer\u201d. EVB Is it ever OK to wear socks with sandals? To this, the answer is a definite: Yes. But again, make clear it is deliberate. As the sock-styling expert and Man Repeller journalist Harling Ross has noted, explicit coordination makes it clear that any unusual use of accessories is intentional. If you\u2019re feeling a bit hesitant, see the sophisticated version of the socks and sandals look as touted at the most recent Agnona show. Socks were paired with sandals of the same shade or just a little different; a subtler way to dip a toe. Or, one step up: look to the styling of duck-egg-blue socks with navy-blue sandals at spring/summer 2020 Sies Marjan menswear show. EVB Should I wear my socks pulled up? \u201cIs there another way to wear your socks?\u201d Shaw asks. For her, pulling them up \u201clooks the best but also avoids the awkward bunching that can look like cankles\u201d. There\u2019s an easy sartorial win to be had for men in shorts and sports socks just by pulling them up \u2013 but be sure to look like you mean it. Charlie Teasdale, Esquire\u2019s style director, also thinks socks should be pulled up \u201cin any vaguely formal situation\u201d \u2013 he even suggests, \u201cif you were so inclined\u201d, investing in some sock suspenders. EVB Is it OK to wear white socks? Yes and no. Yes, when playing sport; no, when wearing a suit \u2013 until recently that is. Now, it is the subversive nature of white socks that makes them so appealing, says the fashion stylist Tom Stubbs, who wears his with Prada penny loafers. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s so good about them, they\u2019re wrong!\u201d he says. \u201cFor a tiny bit of man-hosiery, [they are] freighted with controversy \u2026 They appear synonymous with the 80s, a decade decreed fundamentally bad stylistically.

They must make clear exactly what services they expect to be provided and dedicate sufficient funding for this to be achieved. People expect well-maintained roads, regular refuse collections and cultural services, yet funding rarely stretches beyond meeting the urgent needs of social care services.\u201d</p> <p>This month, the Treasury announced that because of delays caused by Brexit, local government would get a stop-gap <a href=\"https://www.room151.co.uk/resources/one-year-settlement-decision-threatens-fair-funding-review/\">one-year funding agreement</a> in place of the planned three-year review.</p> <p>The committee said this uncertainty was causing problems for councils, who were hamstrung by the ministerial failure to deliver on promises to reform social care funding or make clear how plans to fund councils primarily through business rates would work.</p> <p>\u201cWithout clarity about funding in 2020, some local authorities will need to prepare for the worst, making decisions which may unnecessarily reduce spending and represent poor value for money in the longer term,\u201d it said.</p> <p>Although Boris Johnson has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/aug/01/promising-to-fix-social-care-could-cost-boris-johnson-dearly\">promised to tackle</a> the adult social care funding crisis, there is little sign this could happen soon and councils fear the one-year settlement will in effect lock austerity into town hall budgets for a tenth successive year.</p> <p>The Local Government Association <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jul/02/one-in-five-councils-face-drastic-spending-cuts-within-months\">said last month</a> that deteriorating council finances meant one in five councils in England may be forced to impose drastic spending controls to stave off bankruptcy over the next few months.</p> <p>Northamptonshire county council, which effectively collapsed into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/feb/11/northamptonshire-county-council-effective-bankruptcy-tories-cuts\">insolvency</a> last year, recently announced that despite drastic measures designed to make it financially stable it <a href=\"https://www.room151.co.uk/resources/northants-faces-significant-challenge-to-deal-with-new-35m-budget-gap/\">faced a \u00a335m budget gap from next April</a>, almost half of which reflected increased demand for statutory services and inflation costs.</p> <p>The committee called for an injection of \u00a34bn to restore council funding levels to 2001 levels, although it noted that rising demand for adult and children\u2019s social care meant that even this sum would not be sufficient to cover a predicted \u00a35bn gap between town hall funding and needs in 2020-21.</p> <p>\u201cIf HM Treasury wants local government to continue providing the services it currently does, it needs to provide local government with a significant real-terms increase in its spending power,\u201d the MPs said.</p> <p>Over the longer term they urged a broader overhaul of local authority finance, including the creation of new council tax bands, unchanged since 1991, to reflect rises in housing values, as well as a review of the complex and risky plans to fund councils through business rates.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: \u201cWe\u2019re providing local authorities with access to \u00a346.4bn this year \u2013 a real-terms increase. Ultimately, councils are responsible for managing their own resources and we are working with local government to develop a funding system for the future.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Government neglect of deteriorating local authority finances leaves councils with no choice but to prepare for deeper cuts to already depleted services such as libraries, roads and Sure Start centres, a cross-party committee has said. The housing, communities and local government select committee said continuing uncertainty over budgets meant councils in England would have to \u201cprepare for the worst\u201d and make further service cuts and redundancies over the next few months. Ministers\u2019 continuing failure to tackle the council funding crisis meant there would be no let-up on a nine-year squeeze on town hall budgets, which had forced spending reductions of more than 40% in areas such as highways, housing, transport and culture, the MPs said. \u201cThis constant stress on local government is now compounded by a failure to even set out how much money they will be allocated in the next financial year,\u201d said the committee chair, Labour\u2019s Clive Betts. \u201cThe time has come for the government to get real with local government funding. They must make clear exactly what services they expect to be provided and dedicate sufficient funding for this to be achieved. People expect well-maintained roads, regular refuse collections and cultural services, yet funding rarely stretches beyond meeting the urgent needs of social care services.\u201d This month, the Treasury announced that because of delays caused by Brexit, local government would get a stop-gap one-year funding agreement in place of the planned three-year review. The committee said this uncertainty was causing problems for councils, who were hamstrung by the ministerial failure to deliver on promises to reform social care funding or make clear how plans to fund councils primarily through business rates would work. \u201cWithout clarity about funding in 2020, some local authorities will need to prepare for the worst, making decisions which may unnecessarily reduce spending and represent poor value for money in the longer term,\u201d it said. Although Boris Johnson has promised to tackle the adult social care funding crisis, there is little sign this could happen soon and councils fear the one-year settlement will in effect lock austerity into town hall budgets for a tenth successive year. The Local Government Association said last month that deteriorating council finances meant one in five councils in England may be forced to impose drastic spending controls to stave off bankruptcy over the next few months. Northamptonshire county council, which effectively collapsed into insolvency last year, recently announced that despite drastic measures designed to make it financially stable it faced a \u00a335m budget gap from next April, almost half of which reflected increased demand for statutory services and inflation costs. The committee called for an injection of \u00a34bn to restore council funding levels to 2001 levels, although it noted that rising demand for adult and children\u2019s social care meant that even this sum would not be sufficient to cover a predicted \u00a35bn gap between town hall funding and needs in 2020-21. \u201cIf HM Treasury wants local government to continue providing the services it currently does, it needs to provide local government with a significant real-terms increase in its spending power,\u201d the MPs said. Over the longer term they urged a broader overhaul of local authority finance, including the creation of new council tax bands, unchanged since 1991, to reflect rises in housing values, as well as a review of the complex and risky plans to fund councils through business rates. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: \u201cWe\u2019re providing local authorities with access to \u00a346.4bn this year \u2013 a real-terms increase. Ultimately, councils are responsible for managing their own resources and we are working with local government to develop a funding system for the future.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Sony Pictures, the studio that owns the film rights to comic book character Spider-Man, has spoken out about the split with Disney that will see the webslinger booted out of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. A statement released by Sony on Tuesday night said the company was \u201cdisappointed\u201d by Disney\u2019s demand for a greater stake in the Spider-Man films and by its proposal to scale down the involvement of Marvel president Kevin Feige in the movies. \u201cMuch of today\u2019s news about Spider-Man has mischaracterised recent discussions about Kevin Feige\u2019s involvement in the franchise,\u201d said the statement. \u201cWe are disappointed, but respect Disney\u2019s decision not to have him continue as a lead producer of our next live action Spider-Man film. \u201cWe hope this might change in the future, but understand that the many new responsibilities that Disney has given him \u2013 including all their newly added Marvel properties \u2013 do not allow time for him to work on IP they do not own. \u201cKevin is terrific and we are grateful for his help and guidance and appreciate the path he has helped put us on, which we will continue.\u201d Sony\u2019s words present an unusually public condemnation of the outfit whose purchase of Marvel in 2009 for $4bn (\u00a33.3bn) has heightened its box-office dominance. Negotiations had been under way for some months between Sony and Disney over the future of the property, with Disney demanding future films be financed evenly between the two studios and Feige act as consultant producer. However Sony wanted to stick to existing terms, which entitled Marvel to 5% of first-dollar gross and all merchandising revenue, with the rest going to Sony. The exact financing ratio is unknown. Disney then queried the depth of Feige\u2019s involvement, given the super-producer\u2019s attachment to other Marvel projects, including the new streaming channel Disney Plus, which launches in November. Feige has been closely associated with the Avengers series since the release of Iron Man in 2008, and has been widely credited with satisfying the franchise\u2019s devoted fans alongside Disney\u2019s desire for awards and critical recognition. Black Panther became the first superhero film to win a best picture Oscar nomination in 2018; last month, Avengers: Endgame overtook Avatar as the highest-grossing film of all time. Overall, Feige\u2019s films have taken nearly $27bn. Earlier this week, the latest in the Spider-Man series, Far From Home, deposed Skyfall as Sony\u2019s biggest film ever at the global box office. Two further films starring Tom Holland are said to be in the works. In 2015, Marvel and Sony brokered their rights-sharing arrangement that would mean Spider-Man could appear in Avengers movies \u2013 and vice-versa. The split therefore presents a substantial plotting headache for both companies, as Holland\u2019s Spider-Man had appeared in five Marvel Cinematic Universe films to date, and Far From Home teed up the next major Avengers storyline. The series also now faces substantial major-character holes, after Endgame saw the departure from the series of many of its key figures. Writing on Instagram, Jeremy Renner (who plays Hawkeye in the Avengers films) expressed the hope Spider-Man could return to the fold \u2013 addressing his concerns to Sony, rather than Disney. \u2022 This article was amended on 21 August 2019. Sony Pictures owns the film rights to Spider-Man, but not the rights to the comic book character as an earlier version said.",

      "bodyText": "The new operator of the site of Australia\u2019s worst ever oil spill has dismissed concerns it might not have the financial capacity to clean up should disaster strike again. Ten years ago on Wednesday an estimated 40 million litres of oil leaked from a faulty rig in the Montara field, in the Timor Sea, and for 10 weeks spread over tens of thousands of square kilometres of ocean. In federal court proceedings, Indonesian seaweed farmers claimed the spill devastated their crops, costing them as much as $200m. At the time, Montara was owned by an Australian subsidiary of Thai national petroleum company PTTEP. However, last year PTTEP agreed to sell the field to junior oil player Jadestone Energy for US$195m. Jadestone has never made a profit but the company\u2019s chief executive, Paul Blakeley, told the Guardian it was fully insured to cover the cost of cleaning up a major spill, which can run into the hundreds of millions of dollars. \u201cThe Montara asset is in good hands and we\u2019ve got exciting plans for it,\u201d he said. Jadestone and PTTEP jointly decided to close the field in September last year, he said. In November, the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority (Nopsema) ordered it not be reopened \u201cuntil the company demonstrates to Nopsema\u2019s satisfaction that all safety critical equipment and systems required to support production operations at the facility are without risk to the health and safety of workers\u201d. In June, Jadestone said its employees assumed \u201ckey operational leadership positions\u201d at the field, and costs were cut by US$20m a year. Earlier this month, Nopsema approved a new safety plan submitted by Jadestone, allowing production to restart. \u201cWe inherited an asset with a number of regulatory enforcement actions listed on their [Nopsema\u2019s] website,\u201d Blakeley said. \u201cAll of those had to be dealt with and have been dealt with.\u201d He said that in addition to the insurance, Jadestone had also demonstrated the \u201coperational capability\u201d to safely run the oil field. \u201cAs part of the Montara acquisition we\u2019ve taken technical representatives from the underwriters offshore to demonstrate how we\u2019ve improved,\u201d he said. However, Wilderness Society South Australia director Peter Owen said he was concerned about cost-cutting because it was \u201ca major cause of the Montara disaster\u201d. \u201cJadestone\u2019s London Stock Exchange listing says it has not turned a profit and there\u2019s a question of whether it could afford a major oil spill accident,\u201d he said. An inquiry into the Montara disaster found PTTEP\u2019s standards were not adequate and that \u201cthe company\u2019s personnel on the rig demonstrated a manifestly inadequate understanding of their contents and knowledge of what they required\u201d. The company\u2019s \u201csenior personnel on the rig and onshore were also deficient in their decision\u2010making and judgments in relation to a number of important matters\u201d, commissioner David Borthwick said. Borthwick found PTTEP also \u201cseriously misled\u201d the regulator and said its licence should be reviewed. However, PTTEP was fined just $500,000 and was allowed to resume production. Jadestone, which is listed on the London AIM market, has not made a full-year profit since 2014, running up accumulated losses of more than US$309m. However, it turned a profit in the quarter to the end of March of US$8.3m, which it said was \u201cthe first ever quarter of substantive positive after-tax profit for the company\u201d.",

The 51-year-old former nurse has lodged papers with the court of appeal to apply for permission to overturn his conviction for 12 counts of perverting the course of justice and one of fraud, it has emerged.

The league decided to take no action against Bedoya.</p> <p>Don Garber himself seems unclear on the distinctions, at least going on a recent interview given to ESPN. \u201cA rainbow flag is not a political statement. In this case the Iron Front is a political organization,\u201d he attempted to distinguish. But when pressed on whether a \u2018Make America Great Again\u2019 hat would constitute a political statement, Garber replied that \u201cit\u2019s hard for me to respond to those kinds of things. I don\u2019t want to get engaged with that. It\u2019s very simple: We do not allow for political signage in our stadiums.\u201d Is such opaqueness on the most complex of subjects comprehensive enough?</p> <p>MLS as an organization revels in its status as the sports league of young, progressive America and yet this issue goes against the grain of that reputation. As North American soccer\u2019s top flight, MLS also finds itself stuck between the sporting culture of its homeland(s) and that of the sport itself. Unlike in football, basketball, ice hockey or baseball, political expression is intertwined through the very fabric of soccer fandom. MLS has long made a success of combining North American sporting practice with that of European soccer, but in this case this approach has put the league in a difficult position.</p> <p>MLS, however, is the only major North American sports league that bans political signage through its fan code of conduct. A number of venues across the NBA, NFL, NHL and MLB implement policy which prohibits the display of such messages (Madison Square Garden, Dodger Stadium and MetLife Stadium are just a few of the stadiums that restrict banners and signs), but none are bound by a league-wide code. Champions League clubs are, though - Uefa prohibits the use of \u201cany message that is not fit for a sports event, particularly messages that are of a political, ideological, religious, offensive or provocative nature.\u201d</p> <p>It should be pointed out that MLS and its member clubs have been active in rooting out right-wing displays \u2013 a Trump 2020 flag was removed before a Portland Timbers game earlier this season. This is the argument the league would surely make \u2013 if political signage at matches is permitted then MLS stadiums could become arenas for both sides of the divide.</p> <p>Some would argue this is happening regardless. There were scuffles between Seattle Sounders fans and far-right protesters before a game earlier this month, while there has been a creeping influence of white supremacy into the New York City FC support of late. Meanwhile, MLS continues to push its \u2018Soccer For All\u2019 campaign \u2013 an initiative designed to showcase \u201cthe collective efforts taking place throughout the league to foster more inclusive communities.\u201d To many, as long as MLS upholds its ban on political signage, specifically the Iron Front symbol, these words mean nothing.</p>",

A number of venues across the NBA, NFL, NHL and MLB implement policy which prohibits the display of such messages (Madison Square Garden, Dodger Stadium and MetLife Stadium are just a few of the stadiums that restrict banners and signs), but none are bound by a league-wide code. Champions League clubs are, though - Uefa prohibits the use of \u201cany message that is not fit for a sports event, particularly messages that are of a political, ideological, religious, offensive or provocative nature.\u201d It should be pointed out that MLS and its member clubs have been active in rooting out right-wing displays \u2013 a Trump 2020 flag was removed before a Portland Timbers game earlier this season. This is the argument the league would surely make \u2013 if political signage at matches is permitted then MLS stadiums could become arenas for both sides of the divide. Some would argue this is happening regardless. There were scuffles between Seattle Sounders fans and far-right protesters before a game earlier this month, while there has been a creeping influence of white supremacy into the New York City FC support of late. Meanwhile, MLS continues to push its \u2018Soccer For All\u2019 campaign \u2013 an initiative designed to showcase \u201cthe collective efforts taking place throughout the league to foster more inclusive communities.\u201d To many, as long as MLS upholds its ban on political signage, specifically the Iron Front symbol, these words mean nothing.",

I\u2019ve got to make sure after the Euros that my players are still listening to my messages, that they\u2019re still challenged by me and that the FA look at me as the right person to take this team forward.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a two-way thing. My contract is up to 2021; at this time the FA are happy with the job I\u2019m doing.

Neville, reflecting on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/02/usa-england-womens-world-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">the semi-final defeat</a> by the world champions, said: \u201cUSA were the better team. We just fell a little bit short \u2013 that\u2019s the realism and the honesty we need to accept. We could come back and say we were a toenail or a penalty from going through but really the feeling we all had was we were just a bit short. That is the pain and the frustration but also the challenge in front of us.\u201d</p> <p>Of the World Cup squad, the goalkeeper Karen Bardsley and the striker Ellen White will \u201cprobably be out for a couple of camps\u201d, said Neville, delivering a blow to Manchester City fans eager for the pair to be fit for the start of the Women\u2019s Super League season.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re hoping, saying our prayers, they\u2019re both going to be back for the Wembley game in November but we\u2019re not going to take any risks,\u201d Neville said.</p> <p>He is also cautious about the potential returns of the long-term absentees Jordan Nobbs (ACL) and Izzy Christiansen (ankle). \u201cIzzy is back in full training. She\u2019s done pre-season with Lyon, we\u2019ve been in contact with her, she knows she needs game time \u2013 she\u2019s not played since the Japan game at the SheBelieves [in March]. She\u2019s probably played a practice game and a couple of training games, so she needs to build up her match fitness,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to take the long road with Jordan. We\u2019re going to make sure we don\u2019t rush her back. She\u2019s a big player for us. Hopefully she\u2019ll start the season for Arsenal. We\u2019ve got to make sure we protect her that she gets her strength fitness and durability back.\u201d</p> <p>With Karen Carney having retired and Jill Scott being rested, the new Manchester City signing Aoife Mannion and Chelsea\u2019s 2018-19 top scorer Beth England have been called into the fold for the first time. They are joined by two graduates from the under-20 squad who finished third in the World Cup last year.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/18/us-women-soccer-pay-dispute-megan-rapinoe\">The US team\u2019s dispute over pay is a fight for women all over the world | Suzanne Wrack</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Clemson University goalkeeper Sandy MacIver and the former Arsenal defender Anna Patten, who plays for the University of South Carolina, make the leap at the age of 21 and 20 respectively.</p> <p>The difficulty, with a home Euros meaning automatic qualification for 2021, is finding top-level teams to face in friendlies. \u201cI think come October when the qualifiers are over we\u2019ll have more nations who will want to sample playing in England,\u201d Neville said.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s up until that point that we\u2019re really struggling to find the top opposition. France, the Netherlands, they\u2019re all in qualifying games, so it\u2019s hard to sort these games.\u201d</p> <p>England secured qualification for Team GB at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics by finishing in the top three European teams at the World Cup.

      "bodyText": "Phil Neville has a photograph in his office showing the heartache of defeat by USA in the World Cup semi-finals and the image is driving his \u201cdream\u201d to stay beyond his 2021 contract and lead England to the 2023 tournament. \u201cCoaching hasn\u2019t given me that feeling before so to go to 2023 would be another dream,\u201d the England manager said, quashing speculation over his long-term commitment. \u201cThis summer gave me everything and more that I wanted in my career. \u201cThe players need to be excited and challenged. I\u2019ve got to make sure after the Euros that my players are still listening to my messages, that they\u2019re still challenged by me and that the FA look at me as the right person to take this team forward. \u201cIt\u2019s a two-way thing. My contract is up to 2021; at this time the FA are happy with the job I\u2019m doing. I\u2019ve fallen in love with the job and I don\u2019t see any reason why it can\u2019t continue.\u201d England play Belgium next Thursday and Norway the following Tuesday in their first friendlies since their World Cup exit in France. Neville, reflecting on the semi-final defeat by the world champions, said: \u201cUSA were the better team. We just fell a little bit short \u2013 that\u2019s the realism and the honesty we need to accept. We could come back and say we were a toenail or a penalty from going through but really the feeling we all had was we were just a bit short. That is the pain and the frustration but also the challenge in front of us.\u201d Of the World Cup squad, the goalkeeper Karen Bardsley and the striker Ellen White will \u201cprobably be out for a couple of camps\u201d, said Neville, delivering a blow to Manchester City fans eager for the pair to be fit for the start of the Women\u2019s Super League season. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping, saying our prayers, they\u2019re both going to be back for the Wembley game in November but we\u2019re not going to take any risks,\u201d Neville said. He is also cautious about the potential returns of the long-term absentees Jordan Nobbs (ACL) and Izzy Christiansen (ankle). \u201cIzzy is back in full training. She\u2019s done pre-season with Lyon, we\u2019ve been in contact with her, she knows she needs game time \u2013 she\u2019s not played since the Japan game at the SheBelieves [in March]. She\u2019s probably played a practice game and a couple of training games, so she needs to build up her match fitness,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to take the long road with Jordan. We\u2019re going to make sure we don\u2019t rush her back. She\u2019s a big player for us. Hopefully she\u2019ll start the season for Arsenal. We\u2019ve got to make sure we protect her that she gets her strength fitness and durability back.\u201d With Karen Carney having retired and Jill Scott being rested, the new Manchester City signing Aoife Mannion and Chelsea\u2019s 2018-19 top scorer Beth England have been called into the fold for the first time. They are joined by two graduates from the under-20 squad who finished third in the World Cup last year. The Clemson University goalkeeper Sandy MacIver and the former Arsenal defender Anna Patten, who plays for the University of South Carolina, make the leap at the age of 21 and 20 respectively. The difficulty, with a home Euros meaning automatic qualification for 2021, is finding top-level teams to face in friendlies. \u201cI think come October when the qualifiers are over we\u2019ll have more nations who will want to sample playing in England,\u201d Neville said. \u201cIt\u2019s up until that point that we\u2019re really struggling to find the top opposition. France, the Netherlands, they\u2019re all in qualifying games, so it\u2019s hard to sort these games.\u201d England secured qualification for Team GB at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics by finishing in the top three European teams at the World Cup. Getting into the smaller squad, which will also likely include players from Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, is a useful incentive for players. \u201cWe can take only 18 players and we took 24 to the World Cup,\u201d Neville said. \u201cIn our meeting on Monday we\u2019ll be under no illusions that the bar is going to have to be raised by everybody, so that for me is a great carrot to dangle in front of them. It\u2019s great we have the Olympics in the programme this year. If we didn\u2019t I think it would have been a really difficult year.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The most senior Catholic cleric in the world to be convicted of child sexual abuse, Cardinal George Pell, has lost his appeal against his conviction, but maintains he is innocent. In a brief statement issued after the decision the Vatican reiterated that Pell maintained his innocence, and that it was now \u201cPell\u2019s right to appeal to the high court\u201d. \u201cAt this time, together with the church in Australia, the Holy See confirms its closeness to the victims of sexual abuse and its commitment to pursue, through the competent ecclesiastical authorities, those members who commit such abuse,\u201d the statement also said. No mention was made of stripping Pell of his cardinal title. On Wednesday the Victorian court of appeal in Melbourne, Australia, dismissed Pell\u2019s appeal, with two of the three appellant judges describing the complainant who accused Pell as a compelling, truthful witness. The jury had not been unreasonable in convicting Pell on one count of sexual penetration of a child under the age of 16 and four counts of an indecent act against a child under the age of 16, the chief justice, Anne Ferguson, and appeal court president justice, Chris Maxwell, found. A third judge, Mark Weinberg, disagreed, finding the complainant was inclined to embellish aspects of his testimony and that he could not exclude the possibility that some of what he said was concocted. But in the court of appeal judges are required only to reach a majority decision. Pell was escorted back to jail, where he will continue to serve a six-year sentence for sexually abusing two 13-year-old choirboys in 1996, while he was archbishop of Melbourne. After Sunday solemn mass at St Patrick\u2019s Cathedral in Melbourne, Pell orally raped one of the boys in the priest\u2019s sacristy and indecently assaulted both of them. Pell offended again against one of the boys about a month later, when he grabbed the boy\u2019s genitals in the church corridor, once more after Sunday solemn mass. \u201cThroughout his evidence, [the complainant] came across as someone who was telling the truth,\u201d Ferguson said. \u201cHe did not seek to embellish his evidence or tailor it in a manner favourable to the prosecution. As might have been expected, there were some things which he could remember and many things which he could not. And his explanations of why that was so had the ring of truth.\u201d The judges unanimously agreed that Pell\u2019s other two grounds of appeal, which concerned legal issues, failed. He will be eligible for parole in 2022. Through his lawyer the complainant issued a statement, saying: \u201cSome commentators have suggested that I reported to the police somehow for my own personal gain. \u201cNothing could be further from the truth. I have risked my privacy, my health, my wellbeing, my family. I have not instructed any solicitor in relation to a claim for compensation. This is not about money and never had been. Although my faith has taken a battering it is still a part of my life, and part of the lives of my loved ones.\u201d The second victim died of a heroin overdose at the age of 30 in 2014, and his father shed tears after the appeal dismissal. In a statement, Pell\u2019s spokeswoman said the cardinal was \u201cobviously disappointed with the decision today\u201d. \u201cHowever his legal team will thoroughly examine the judgment in order to determine a special leave application to the high court. Cardinal Pell maintains his innocence. We thank his many supporters.\u201d When he learned his fate in the court, Pell bowed his head slightly, but did not show any expression. Pell was made a Companion of the Order of Australia in 2005 for his service to the Catholic church and for his work in education and social justice. Following the court decision, Australia\u2019s prime minister, Scott Morrison, said he believed Pell would be stripped of those honours. \u201cThat is a process that is done independently, and that course will now follow,\u201d he said. The archbishop of Melbourne, Peter Comensoli, called upon the public to respect the court\u2019s decision. He said that his thoughts and prayers were with the man who had brought Pell before the courts. \u201cI humbly acknowledge it has been a challenging time for him, and I stand ready to offer pastoral care and spiritual help, should he seek it,\u201d Comensoli said. Pell, too, would receive care. \u201cIn Christian charity, I will ensure that Cardinal Pell is provided pastoral and spiritual support while he serves the remainder of his sentence, according to the teaching and example of Jesus to visit those in prison,\u201d he said. The president of the Australian Catholic Bishops Conference, Archbishop Mark Coleridge, offered similar sentiments, saying: \u201cThis has been and remains a most difficult time for survivors of child sexual abuse and those who support them\u201d. \u201cWe acknowledge the pain that those abused by clergy have experienced through the long process of the trials and appeal of Cardinal Pell,\u201d Coleridge said. \u201cWe also acknowledge that this judgment will be distressing to many people.\u201d The decision and reasons from the appellant judges ran to some 300 pages, but Ferguson read a summary of the judgment to a court packed with media, survivors and Pell supporters on Wednesday. \u201cCardinal Pell\u2019s conviction and this appeal have attracted widespread attention, both in Australia and beyond,\u201d she said. \u201cHe is a senior figure in the Catholic church and is internationally well known. As the trial judge, Chief Judge Kidd, commented when sentencing Cardinal Pell, there has been vigorous and sometimes emotional criticism of the cardinal and he has been publicly vilified in some sections of the community. There has also been strong public support for the cardinal by others. Indeed, it is fair to say that his case has divided the community.\u201d She said it was important that Pell was not made a scapegoat for any perceived failings of the Catholic church to address child sexual abuse. But she was unequivocal about her and Maxwell\u2019s judgment in relation to the five charges on which Pell was convicted. \u201cThe complainant was a very compelling witness, was clearly not a liar, was not a fantasist and was a witness of truth,\u201d she said.",

      "body": "<p>The moment we speak about history, we encounter the problem of where to locate it. History, we tend to think, is behind and around us, a structure we inhabit and by which we are shaped. This partial truth, though, obscures a more intimate reality. History resides within us; it arises directly from our actions and choices. Unless we remain conscious of this, the \u201cstudy\u201d of history, too often predicated on an illusion of remove, becomes an act not of interrogation, but of evasion.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/deborah-levy\" title=\"\">Deborah Levy</a>\u2019s exquisite new novel <em>The Man Who Saw Everything</em> \u2013 her seventh, and her third in a row to be nominated for the Booker prize \u2013 both unmasks and confronts this convenient denial of individual culpability. The \u201cMan\u201d of the title is Saul Adler, a historian. The \u201cEverything\u201d is both his life and ours: his loves and disappointments, a history of 20th-century Europe viewed through, and embodied by, the fragmented memories of a single wounded mind.</p> <p>When we first meet Saul, it is 1988. He is 23 and researching the history of cultural opposition to fascism. On his way to meet his lover, Jennifer Moreau, he is knocked down by a car on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2012/jun/10/jon-savage-abbey-road-studios\" title=\"\">Abbey Road</a> in north-west London. Superficially injured, he keeps his appointment with Jennifer, a photographer who has made Saul her subject. After they sleep together, Jennifer breaks up with him, and Saul travels to East Berlin to continue his research. There, he falls in love with his translator, Walter M\u00fcller, and also sleeps with Walter\u2019s sister, Luna, at which point the narrative breaks. When we next see Saul it is 2016 and, again, he is run over on Abbey Road. This time, though, the accident is more serious. He is hospitalised, and drifts in and out of consciousness. As he tries to recover his memories, the events of the intervening years swim slowly into focus.</p> <p>Saul\u2019s life, we come to understand, functions as a kind of psychoanalytic mirror of Europe, with events in the material world finding their emotional counterparts in his disordered memories. Early on, Saul and Jennifer reflect on Marx and Engels\u2019s observation that \u201ca spectre is haunting Europe\u201d. That word \u201cspectre\u201d will come to haunt the novel, assuming a variety of forms and functions. It is used to describe a toy wooden train in Walter\u2019s possession \u2013 a clue to his secret heterosexual family life that shadows his brief relationship with Saul. Next, the spectre is Walter\u2019s unexpectedly \u201cauthoritarian voice\u201d, which conjures two distinct modes of oppression. \u201cHe was ventriloquising the voice of the state,\u201d Saul says, \u201cand he sounded like my father.\u201d Towards the end of the book, when Saul attends an exhibition of Jennifer\u2019s photographic work, he thinks: \u201cThere is a spectre inside every photograph.\u201d The spectre, of course, is the subject: Saul himself.</p> <p>Levy\u2019s singular achievement in this novel is that it is not simply these spectres that shapeshift. Saul\u2019s entire emotional and psychological topography is unstable, questionable, and within that fluid context, everything has the power to haunt. As he struggles to bring order to his own narrative, even the smallest details recur, reform, assume new significance and meaning. When he tries to buy sunflowers for Jennifer, he is unable to find a florist that stocks anything but roses. Later, Walter\u2019s mother smells of roses, and later still someone brings Saul roses during his convalescence in hospital. Luna, meanwhile, is convinced she is being stalked by a jaguar. When she helps Saul bury a small quantity of his father\u2019s ashes, the emotional impact leaves him feeling \u201cas if I had just been disembowelled by a jaguar\u201d. When he is knocked down for the second time, the car is a Jaguar, and fragments of its shattered wing mirror become lodged in his head.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Levy is deeply attuned to human anguish. She also reminds us of fiction\u2019s other great function: the loosening of\u00a0boundaries</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This intricate patterning of objects and symbols, which becomes for the reader a kind of psychoanalytic code or interpretive mystery, allows for a complementary layering of phenomena and ideas. Ultimately, Levy is concerned with power \u2013 the forms it takes in our lives, the extent to which it is something we both possess and are subjected to. Like the haunting spectres and codified, repeating images and ideas, power keeps reappearing, and each time it does so, it takes a slightly different shape. The \u201cauthoritarian regime\u201d of East Germany finds its mirror in the \u201cregime\u201d of Saul\u2019s overbearing father. Censorship is enacted not only through the state\u2019s control of art and writing, but through Walter\u2019s \u201ccensorship\u201d of his homosexual desire. Saul\u2019s constant feeling of being surveilled while in Germany is reflected both in his role as Jennifer\u2019s photographic subject and in the way, when Saul and Jennifer argue, he feels punished for an \u201cunconscious crime\u201d. Indeed, their entire relationship is an exercise in the rebalancing of patriarchal power. Not only does Jennifer make Saul her muse, thereby inverting the traditional misogynist binary of male artist and female subject, she forbids him from ever describing her beauty, even as she devotes so much of her time to documenting his.</p> <p>With sexual, familial and political power, of course, comes cruelty, which like everything else in this book functions at both a state-wide and interpersonal level. Saul has a \u201cPhD on the psychology of male tyrants\u201d, and is wounded by his own father\u2019s tyranny, but his studies and recriminations look only outwards, affording him the luxury of displaced responsibility and pain. As Saul\u2019s disordered memories cohere, the life that emerges is not exactly blameless. In the failed intimacy of his relationships, his role is not solely that of victim; in the landscape of political oppression that he makes his subject, his responsibility extends somewhat further than that of the detached, clean-handed observer. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t care about his own life,\u201d Walter bluntly observes, \u201cso he doesn\u2019t care about the lives of others.\u201d</p> <p>It has become fashionable, as interest in literary fiction is perceived to have waned, to make a case for what it is that the novel can \u201cdo\u201d for us. Often, this is framed around the idea of empathy. Levy\u2019s writing is, no doubt, deeply attuned to human anguish and loss, but her real talent is to remind us of fiction\u2019s other great function: the loosening of boundaries. As Saul picks his way, tantalisingly, through the symbols and signs of his own obscured history, we find that the borders between his emotional landscape and the material conditions he inhabits, between what he feels and what he sees, between self and other, even between the individual and collective, become eerily porous.

Just as it is easier to study \u201chistory\u201d as an entity distinct from our own emotional reality, so too it is far simpler and more comfortable to condemn brutality on a mass scale than it is to accept, and atone for, our own smaller acts of devastation.

      "bodyText": "The moment we speak about history, we encounter the problem of where to locate it. History, we tend to think, is behind and around us, a structure we inhabit and by which we are shaped. This partial truth, though, obscures a more intimate reality. History resides within us; it arises directly from our actions and choices. Unless we remain conscious of this, the \u201cstudy\u201d of history, too often predicated on an illusion of remove, becomes an act not of interrogation, but of evasion. Deborah Levy\u2019s exquisite new novel The Man Who Saw Everything \u2013 her seventh, and her third in a row to be nominated for the Booker prize \u2013 both unmasks and confronts this convenient denial of individual culpability. The \u201cMan\u201d of the title is Saul Adler, a historian. The \u201cEverything\u201d is both his life and ours: his loves and disappointments, a history of 20th-century Europe viewed through, and embodied by, the fragmented memories of a single wounded mind. When we first meet Saul, it is 1988. He is 23 and researching the history of cultural opposition to fascism. On his way to meet his lover, Jennifer Moreau, he is knocked down by a car on Abbey Road in north-west London. Superficially injured, he keeps his appointment with Jennifer, a photographer who has made Saul her subject. After they sleep together, Jennifer breaks up with him, and Saul travels to East Berlin to continue his research. There, he falls in love with his translator, Walter M\u00fcller, and also sleeps with Walter\u2019s sister, Luna, at which point the narrative breaks. When we next see Saul it is 2016 and, again, he is run over on Abbey Road. This time, though, the accident is more serious. He is hospitalised, and drifts in and out of consciousness. As he tries to recover his memories, the events of the intervening years swim slowly into focus. Saul\u2019s life, we come to understand, functions as a kind of psychoanalytic mirror of Europe, with events in the material world finding their emotional counterparts in his disordered memories. Early on, Saul and Jennifer reflect on Marx and Engels\u2019s observation that \u201ca spectre is haunting Europe\u201d. That word \u201cspectre\u201d will come to haunt the novel, assuming a variety of forms and functions. It is used to describe a toy wooden train in Walter\u2019s possession \u2013 a clue to his secret heterosexual family life that shadows his brief relationship with Saul. Next, the spectre is Walter\u2019s unexpectedly \u201cauthoritarian voice\u201d, which conjures two distinct modes of oppression. \u201cHe was ventriloquising the voice of the state,\u201d Saul says, \u201cand he sounded like my father.\u201d Towards the end of the book, when Saul attends an exhibition of Jennifer\u2019s photographic work, he thinks: \u201cThere is a spectre inside every photograph.\u201d The spectre, of course, is the subject: Saul himself. Levy\u2019s singular achievement in this novel is that it is not simply these spectres that shapeshift. Saul\u2019s entire emotional and psychological topography is unstable, questionable, and within that fluid context, everything has the power to haunt. As he struggles to bring order to his own narrative, even the smallest details recur, reform, assume new significance and meaning. When he tries to buy sunflowers for Jennifer, he is unable to find a florist that stocks anything but roses. Later, Walter\u2019s mother smells of roses, and later still someone brings Saul roses during his convalescence in hospital. Luna, meanwhile, is convinced she is being stalked by a jaguar. When she helps Saul bury a small quantity of his father\u2019s ashes, the emotional impact leaves him feeling \u201cas if I had just been disembowelled by a jaguar\u201d. When he is knocked down for the second time, the car is a Jaguar, and fragments of its shattered wing mirror become lodged in his head. This intricate patterning of objects and symbols, which becomes for the reader a kind of psychoanalytic code or interpretive mystery, allows for a complementary layering of phenomena and ideas. Ultimately, Levy is concerned with power \u2013 the forms it takes in our lives, the extent to which it is something we both possess and are subjected to. Like the haunting spectres and codified, repeating images and ideas, power keeps reappearing, and each time it does so, it takes a slightly different shape. The \u201cauthoritarian regime\u201d of East Germany finds its mirror in the \u201cregime\u201d of Saul\u2019s overbearing father. Censorship is enacted not only through the state\u2019s control of art and writing, but through Walter\u2019s \u201ccensorship\u201d of his homosexual desire. Saul\u2019s constant feeling of being surveilled while in Germany is reflected both in his role as Jennifer\u2019s photographic subject and in the way, when Saul and Jennifer argue, he feels punished for an \u201cunconscious crime\u201d. Indeed, their entire relationship is an exercise in the rebalancing of patriarchal power. Not only does Jennifer make Saul her muse, thereby inverting the traditional misogynist binary of male artist and female subject, she forbids him from ever describing her beauty, even as she devotes so much of her time to documenting his. With sexual, familial and political power, of course, comes cruelty, which like everything else in this book functions at both a state-wide and interpersonal level. Saul has a \u201cPhD on the psychology of male tyrants\u201d, and is wounded by his own father\u2019s tyranny, but his studies and recriminations look only outwards, affording him the luxury of displaced responsibility and pain. As Saul\u2019s disordered memories cohere, the life that emerges is not exactly blameless. In the failed intimacy of his relationships, his role is not solely that of victim; in the landscape of political oppression that he makes his subject, his responsibility extends somewhat further than that of the detached, clean-handed observer. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t care about his own life,\u201d Walter bluntly observes, \u201cso he doesn\u2019t care about the lives of others.\u201d It has become fashionable, as interest in literary fiction is perceived to have waned, to make a case for what it is that the novel can \u201cdo\u201d for us. Often, this is framed around the idea of empathy. Levy\u2019s writing is, no doubt, deeply attuned to human anguish and loss, but her real talent is to remind us of fiction\u2019s other great function: the loosening of boundaries. As Saul picks his way, tantalisingly, through the symbols and signs of his own obscured history, we find that the borders between his emotional landscape and the material conditions he inhabits, between what he feels and what he sees, between self and other, even between the individual and collective, become eerily porous. In softening and blurring these distinctions, Levy\u2019s implied question feels painful and apposite: how can we have any hope of resisting political tyranny when we are so tragically unable to expunge it from our personal lives? It is at this level, the level of cruelty and complicity, the level at which regimes both large and small cohere, that the bold design behind Levy\u2019s intricate motifs and symbols becomes clear. She is asking us to consider a spectrum of harm, and where along that spectrum different incidences of cruelty might fall. Just as it is easier to study \u201chistory\u201d as an entity distinct from our own emotional reality, so too it is far simpler and more comfortable to condemn brutality on a mass scale than it is to accept, and atone for, our own smaller acts of devastation.

A big, bright screen, sleek design, solid performance and excellent battery life - the best of any of Samsung\u2019s S10 variants.</p> <p>The rear camera is also very good and Samsung\u2019s One UI is great, as long as you\u2019re happy using navigation buttons as the swipe gestures are hard to use on this size of phone. It is massive and expensive, meaning only big-phone lovers are going to want to even try and use it.</p> <p>Its 5G performance is solid on Vodafone\u2019s new 5G network. But the poor 4G performance on Vodafone of the S10 5G and its smaller S10 siblings, which neither the network nor Samsung have managed to explain, mean I strongly recommend not buying any top-end Samsung phone on Vodafone.</p> <p>It may not quite be the best 5G experience available at the moment \u2013 that\u2019s the OnePlus 7 Pro 5G \u2013 but it\u2019s close run thing.

      "bodyText": "The Galaxy S10 5G is the largest, most advanced and most expensive smartphone in Samsung\u2019s current lineup, aimed not just at being \u201cthe 5G one\u201d but also the best one. Unlike the OnePlus 7 Pro, which comes in either 4G or 5G versions that are identical in size, weight and features, the S10 5G is its own phone. It\u2019s bigger, heavier, thicker and has more cameras and sensors on the back and front than the S10+. The front is filled by the 6.7in QHD+ AMOLED screen, which curves at the sides and has an large oval-shaped cut out in the top right of the display for two selfie cameras and a depth sensor. The screen is really lovely, as you\u2019d expect for a top Samsung: bright, crisp and colourful with good viewing angles. It is not quite as bright or smooth as the fantastic 90Hz screen on the OnePlus 7 Pro, but better than all the rest. The massive screen means the S10 5G is a very big phone. At 77.1mm wide and 162.6mm tall the S10 5G compares similarly to 5G rivals such the OnePlus 7 Pro or the 4G-only iPhone XS Max. But the way the back tapers at the sides and its comparatively light 198g weight, which undercuts the competition by 8-10g, makes the S10 5G just about manageable. I could fit it in a men\u2019s jeans pocket, but anything smaller was a struggle. If you don\u2019t want the biggest of phones and the downsides of weight, cost, size, one-handed use, etc that come with them, this is most definitely not for you. The display hides Samsung\u2019s ultrasonic fingerprint scanner for unlocking the phone with your thumb on the screen, which works well enough but isn\u2019t as fast or accurate as the optical sensor on the OnePlus 7 Pro 5G or traditional fingerprint sensors. The phone is water resistant to the international IP68 standard, or depths of up to 1.5 metres in fresh water for 30 minutes. Drop the S10 5G in the toilet and you\u2019ll be able to rinse it afterwards. It also has a headphone socket, which is rare in 2019. Specifications Screen: 6.7in QHD+ AMOLED (502ppi). Processor: Samsung Exynos 9820 or Qualcomm Snapdragon 855. RAM: 8GB of RAM. Storage: 256GB. Operating system: One UI based on Android 9 Pie. Camera: rear triple camera + depth sensor, front 10MP selfie-camera + depth sensor. Connectivity: single sim, LTE, 5G, wifi, NFC, Bluetooth 5, wireless charging and GPS. Dimensions: 162.6 x 77.1 x 7.9mm. Weight: 198g. 36-hour battery life The Galaxy S10 5G has the same processor, memory and storage as most of the other Galaxy S10 versions and therefore performs similarly. In this US this means Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon 855 processor, but in the UK, Europe and many other regions it means Samsung\u2019s own Exynos 9820, as tested here. It\u2019s a fast-feeling phone, if not quite the fastest, and will handle most of what you can throw at it. Games and augmented reality experiences, which are being pushed hard with 5G, were smooth but made the phone heat up quite a bit. The S10 5G has the largest battery in Samsung\u2019s S10 phone line and so lasts the longest at 36 hours between charges. With the screen set to default FHD+ resolution and the always-on display (AOD) setting off, the phone made it from 7am on day one until 7pm on day two with fairly heavy usage, mainly on 4G with bursts on Vodafone\u2019s new 5G network where available in London. The S10 5G is also faster charging than Samsung\u2019s other phones with a 25W charger included in the box. It hit 90% in an hour, which is still not the fastest charging phone but is a significant improvement over other Samsung devices. Wireless charging at up to 15W with a Qi charging matt works well, as does wireless power sharing charging something else from the back of the S10 5G such as Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Buds. Network performance The S10 5G proved great on Vodafone\u2019s new 5G network, which was significantly faster than 4G when available, routinely managing 200Mbps download speeds in areas where Vodafone\u2019s 4G network managed around 20-50Mbps. But the S10 5G\u2019s 4G performance on Vodafone\u2019s network was poor, spending a significant amount of time dropping down to 3G in areas where a OnePlus 7 Pro and Huawei P30 Pro had strong 4G signal on the same Vodafone 4G network. The issue was particularly problematic on public transport. This poor performance gave rise to further testing which revealed that the poor signal performance on Vodafone\u2019s 4G network wasn\u2019t isolated to Samsung\u2019s new 5G phone \u2013 but also its regular 4G phones including the Galaxy S10. The 4G-only phones had a slight advantage of around half a bar of signal strength over their 5G counterparts on the same network. However, when the Samsung phones dropped down to 3G their internet connection effectively became unusable causing everything from web pages and apps, to messages and even email, to time out. But it\u2019s worse than simply being offline, as the phone thinks it has a working internet connection, leading to an extremely frustrating scenario where the phone continually tries over and over to perform the task you\u2019ve set it before timing out after a minute or so. To be clear, Samsung\u2019s S10, S10+ and S10e performed the same as the OnePlus 7 Pro and Huawei P30 Pro (two of the best for network performance) on both EE and Three\u2019s 4G network in and around London and the south of England. The problem appeared only to be on Vodafone. But neither Vodafone nor Samsung could explain the signal issues faced by the Samsung S10 5G and other S10 smartphones. A Vodafone spokesperson said: \u201cWe\u2019ve recalled the device and SIM for internal testing. We would welcome the opportunity to walk around with the Guardian in the areas they have visited to better understand the user experience found so as we can better understand any issues and implement improvements or fixes.\u201d A Samsung spokesperson declined to address the 4G problem and instead said: \u201cThe 5G user experience is only going to get better as 5G network coverage improves and expands. Samsung is working closely with our partners to provide updates to the device so that consumers can get the best network performance.\u201d Samsung One UI The Galaxy S10 5G runs Samsung\u2019s new One UI version of Android 9 Pie, which is the same as the other S10 variants. One UI is a big upgrade over previous versions of Samsung\u2019s software, refocused around making phones with large screens more usable, which was useful here. The top of the screen is generally for information display, while the bits you have to touch have been moved towards the bottom. The only thing that hasn\u2019t aged well are Samsung\u2019s gesture navigation options, which replace the traditional three-key navigation bar at the bottom of the screen with swipe pads where the buttons would be. It\u2019s not a fluid experience and is difficult to use one-handed on this size of screen. While more beneficial for the larger Galaxy S10+, the S10 still benefits from generally having the top half of the phone for viewing information and the bottom half for touch-based interactions. Rival systems such as that used by OnePlus, Huawei or even Google\u2019s upcoming Android Q are far better. Camera The Galaxy S10 5G has the same three regular cameras on the back as the S10 and S10+ but adds a 3D depth camera for good measure. That means you get a main 12-megapixel camera, 12-megapixel telephoto camera and a 16-megapixel ultra-wide angle camera providing zoom from 0.5 to 2x, and then on to a 10x hybrid zoom. There didn\u2019t appear to be much difference between the cameras on the S10 5G and S10/S10+. It produced some excellent photos in good light, with solid but not class-leading low-light performance, despite the new night mode. Video capture was very good, arguably better than many rivals, with fun depth effects using the extra sensors on the S10 5G. The selfie camera is the same as the S10+, which is excellent. Overall, the camera on the S10 5G is good, but falls short of the best from Huawei. Observations The stereo speakers are pretty good. The ultrasonic fingerprint sensor is incompatible with most screen protectors, but a compatible one comes included in the box. The haptic vibrations are sharper than last year\u2019s model, but not as good as Apple\u2019s iPhone or the OnePlus 7 Pro. Palm rejection was good at preventing mis-touches on the curved screen edge, where your hand rests on the touchscreen when you grip. Price The Samsung Galaxy S10 5G costs \u00a31,099 in crown silver or majestic black on either EE or Vodafone. So far, the phone is not available to buy standalone and SIM-free in the UK. For comparison, recommended retail prices for the competition include the OnePlus 7 Pro 5G on plans starting at \u00a359 a month on EE, the 4G 6.4in Galaxy S10+ for \u00a3899, the 4G OnePlus 7 Pro from \u00a3649, the 4G Google Pixel 3 XL costs \u00a3744, the 4G Huawei P30 Pro for \u00a3899 and the 4G iPhone XS Max costs \u00a31,099. Verdict The Galaxy S10 5G has all the hallmarks of a range-topping Samsung. A big, bright screen, sleek design, solid performance and excellent battery life - the best of any of Samsung\u2019s S10 variants. The rear camera is also very good and Samsung\u2019s One UI is great, as long as you\u2019re happy using navigation buttons as the swipe gestures are hard to use on this size of phone. It is massive and expensive, meaning only big-phone lovers are going to want to even try and use it. Its 5G performance is solid on Vodafone\u2019s new 5G network. But the poor 4G performance on Vodafone of the S10 5G and its smaller S10 siblings, which neither the network nor Samsung have managed to explain, mean I strongly recommend not buying any top-end Samsung phone on Vodafone. It may not quite be the best 5G experience available at the moment \u2013 that\u2019s the OnePlus 7 Pro 5G \u2013 but it\u2019s close run thing. And where the OnePlus is an EE exclusive in the UK, the S10 5G is available on a wider range of mobile networks. The S10 5G is the biggest and best Samsung you can buy, at least until the recently launched Note 10 arrives in stores, which could take the crown. Pros: great screen, ultrasonic in-display fingerprint scanner, hole-punch notch, wireless charging and powershare, great camera, good performance, good software, good haptics, headphone socket, microSD card slot, 5G. Cons: massive phone, expensive, poor 4G performance on Vodafone, slow software updates.

Not only is he enjoying time with a new baby (his son, Caruso Jack, was born Father\u2019s Day weekend), he\u2019s also juggling a blockbuster list of sold-out standup dates nationwide. As evidence of his current stature, he\u2019s also tackling the coveted gig as master of ceremonies for the upcoming MTV Video Music awards (VMAs). It\u2019s a curious choice for the 46-year-old comedian known for family humor who readily admits he\u2019s not totally familiar with today\u2019s pop music landscape.</p> <p>\u201cThis is one of those things I took I because it\u2019s a challenge for me,\u201d says Maniscalco, with a grog in his voice. \u201cI grew up on MTV watching Madonna, Prince and Michael Jackson. For me to be hosting is kind of surreal. Also, my father keeps on asking me what he should wear. He\u2019s like: \u2018I\u2019m gonna wear a suit.\u2019 I said: \u2018Dad, this isn\u2019t a wedding.

Forbes recently named Maniscalco the fifth-highest earning comedian of the year, with $26m over the last 12 months, making him the only newcomer on a list that includes Dave Chappelle and Jerry Seinfeld (who invited him to be in an episode of Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee). Like Seinfeld, the bulk of Maniscalco\u2019s income comes from standup \u2013 he recently sold out two shows back-to-back at Madison Square Garden (which <a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/8495005/sebastian-maniscalco-boxscore-record-comedy-madison-square-garden\">reportedly</a> was the highest grossing comedy event in North America of all time). In addition, despite embarking on a film career a mere two years ago, he has already appeared in best picture winner Green Book and is starring alongside Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci in Martin Scorsese\u2019s upcoming Netflix drama The Irishman. That\u2019s also not to mention a bestselling memoir and a series of blockbuster standup specials for Showtime and Netflix.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqCluZsEKzs\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VqCluZsEKzs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>\u201cI don\u2019t really think of what\u2019s happened to me in the past two or three years until I talk to people like yourself,\u201d Maniscalco says, reflecting on his career during our interview. \u201cI told my wife that I don\u2019t stop to smell the roses. When I\u2019m in it, I\u2019m doing it and then I\u2019m onto the next thing. Maybe I haven\u2019t been taking the time out to pump the breaks a bit and see where I\u2019m at. It\u2019s been a definite goal of mine to be a little more present. I want to enjoy the moments a little bit more than I have in the past.\u201d</p> <p>That includes the VMA gig; one he has taken seriously, spending whatever free time he\u2019s had this past summer polishing his opening monologue. \u201cI like when an awards show has a host; to be a through-line, keep things moving and have some energy in between acts,\u201d says Maniscalco, alluding to the current trend of going hostless, whether this past Oscars or next month\u2019s Emmy broadcast. While he knows he will have a monologue off top, don\u2019t expect him to roast the likes of VMA pop icons like the Jonas Brothers or Taylor Swift. \u201cWith my style of comedy, I\u2019m not the type of guy to pick on people in the audience,\u201d he notes. \u201cNo 1, I don\u2019t know them and you run the risk of being harsh when you don\u2019t know somebody and you\u2019re roasting them. I\u2019m customizing my VMA act to what I normally do on stage, so it\u2019ll all be from my point of view.\u201d</p> <p>Maniscalco\u2019s perch will mark a departure recent VMA host history; the show last featured a comedian host in 2012 with Kevin Hart, with recent hosts including Miley Cyrus and Katy Perry. \u201cIt takes awhile to feel comfortable on stage and navigate an audience and be in an environment where people aren\u2019t paying attention and you\u2019re up there telling jokes. There\u2019s a lot of nuance in standup comedy and if you have a non standup host a show, sometimes it can be a little rough.

It personally took him around that span of time in the trenches to rise to his current perch. Born outside of Chicago, Illinois, into an Italian family (his father, the frequent target of his jokes both in his act and colloquially, emigrated to the United States from Sicily), Maniscalco moved to Los Angeles in 1998 with dreams of a career in standup. Instead, he made ends meet for the next seven years as a waiter at a restaurant at the Four Seasons hotel while running to gigs at the famed Comedy Store. \u201cMy interests were obviously outside of the Four Seasons, so working there was just a way to supplement my income while I was doing standup,\u201d says Maniscalco, who\u2019s frank about the rough beginnings of his career. \u201cI was kicking around for 15 years auditioning for TV and film and not landing a damn thing. I used to go into work on my days off and sit by the time clock and ask people if they wanted to go home.

I also waited on Al Pacino, who was alone in the backroom having tea.\u201d A mere decade later, Maniscalco went from waiting on the Hollywood heavyweights to acting alongside them.

He\u2019s just very pleasant and knows what he wants.\u201d</p> <p>Oddly enough, it was the explosion of his stand-up career that eventually made his acting aspirations click. \u201cActing is basically all confidence and it\u2019s easier to feel more at ease when you walk into a casting director\u2019s office and they say, \u2018Oh, my God, we love your doorbell bit\u2019,\u201d says Maniscalco of his viral routine of the differences between household reactions when the doorbell rang from when he was growing up to modern day. \u201cWhen they\u2019re familiar with you, automatically you feel like you\u2019re in the driver\u2019s seat.

      "body": "<p>It was in the late 1920s that the Ku Klux Klan regularly began gathering outside the home of William F Maag Jr in Youngstown. Maag owned the Vindicator newspaper, which unlike others in this once prosperous part of Ohio, had been willing to criticize the racist Klansmen.</p> <p>Men on horseback, clad in white robes and hoods, would burn crosses and flaunt rifles and shotguns, in an attempt at intimidation. It didn\u2019t work. The men of the Maag family would stand outside their home, themselves armed, refusing to be cowed, as the Vindicator continued to expose government officials who were part of the Klan.</p> <p>That defiance set the tone for decades of investigative, combative reporting from the Vindicator. The daily newspaper relentlessly reported on the mafia, the government, big business and even its own advertisers.</p> <p>But no more. Soon after celebrating <a href=\"https://www.vindy.com/news/2019/jun/22/vindicator-celebrates-its-150th-year-publishing/\">150 years</a> since its first edition came news that was devastating to many in Youngstown and the wider Mahoning valley. The Vindicator was shutting down at the end of August. For good.</p> <p>The Vindicator\u2019s closure means Youngstown will soon be the largest city in the US without a major newspaper, and is the latest blow to an ailing American news industry. <a href=\"https://247wallst.com/media/2019/07/23/over-2000-american-newspapers-have-closed-in-past-15-years/\">According to</a> the University of North Carolina, more than 2,000 US newspapers have closed since 2004, and at least 1,300 communities have completely lost news coverage in the past 15 years. In July <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/07/09/u-s-newsroom-employment-has-dropped-by-a-quarter-since-2008/\">a Pew Research Center study</a> reported that the number of journalists in the US declined 47% between 2008 and 2018.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>More than 2,000 US newspapers have closed since 2004.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s a sad end to a newspaper with a long history of fighting injustice \u2013 going all the way back to those days battling the KKK. That fearlessness is what Mark Brown, Maag\u2019s grandson and the fourth-generation owner of the Vindicator, is most proud of.</p> <p>\u201cFighting the Klan I think would have to be number one because that was a core social justice issue,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThe Klan tried to make this area sort of its northern center. There was a lot of support here for the Klan and we fought hard against it, and I think we succeeded for the most part.\u201d</p> <p>The demise of the Vindicator is especially galling given the <a href=\"http://www.vindy.com/news/2019/may/05/the-vindicator-staff-wins--state-awards-/\">multi-award-winning</a> newspaper had marked its 150th anniversary with a look back to the first edition. That first copy, a print of which hangs on the wall at the newspaper\u2019s Youngstown office, was four pages long.

      "bodyText": "It was in the late 1920s that the Ku Klux Klan regularly began gathering outside the home of William F Maag Jr in Youngstown. Maag owned the Vindicator newspaper, which unlike others in this once prosperous part of Ohio, had been willing to criticize the racist Klansmen. Men on horseback, clad in white robes and hoods, would burn crosses and flaunt rifles and shotguns, in an attempt at intimidation. It didn\u2019t work. The men of the Maag family would stand outside their home, themselves armed, refusing to be cowed, as the Vindicator continued to expose government officials who were part of the Klan. That defiance set the tone for decades of investigative, combative reporting from the Vindicator. The daily newspaper relentlessly reported on the mafia, the government, big business and even its own advertisers. But no more. Soon after celebrating 150 years since its first edition came news that was devastating to many in Youngstown and the wider Mahoning valley. The Vindicator was shutting down at the end of August. For good. The Vindicator\u2019s closure means Youngstown will soon be the largest city in the US without a major newspaper, and is the latest blow to an ailing American news industry. According to the University of North Carolina, more than 2,000 US newspapers have closed since 2004, and at least 1,300 communities have completely lost news coverage in the past 15 years. In July a Pew Research Center study reported that the number of journalists in the US declined 47% between 2008 and 2018. It\u2019s a sad end to a newspaper with a long history of fighting injustice \u2013 going all the way back to those days battling the KKK. That fearlessness is what Mark Brown, Maag\u2019s grandson and the fourth-generation owner of the Vindicator, is most proud of. \u201cFighting the Klan I think would have to be number one because that was a core social justice issue,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThe Klan tried to make this area sort of its northern center. There was a lot of support here for the Klan and we fought hard against it, and I think we succeeded for the most part.\u201d The demise of the Vindicator is especially galling given the multi-award-winning newspaper had marked its 150th anniversary with a look back to the first edition. That first copy, a print of which hangs on the wall at the newspaper\u2019s Youngstown office, was four pages long. It carried a story about a boy who had his teeth kicked out by a horse, an article on a farmer who had two sons: one \u201can early riser\u201d and the other \u201can incorrigible sluggard\u201d, and a report on the water depth of the Mahoning River. Now its closure heaps a little more pain onto an already struggling Rust Belt community. The population of Youngstown has halved since 1970, when the city\u2019s steel industry went into a dramatic decline, and in 2007 it had the lowest median income of any US city with more than 65,000 residents. After the steel mills closed, and other businesses departed, tens of thousand of people left Youngstown to find work elsewhere. Some, however, remained, and today there are many older people in Youngstown and elsewhere in the Mahoning valley who have been left behind. \u201cYou still have neighborhoods, where nice little old ladies live, where their kids all moved away to get jobs, [their] husbands died, but the women no longer know each other or the neighbors very well \u2013 or sometimes there\u2019s no neighbors,\u201d said Mark Sweetwood, managing editor of the Vindicator. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve had so many of them call me and use this exact line \u2013 they say: \u2018The Vindicator is my only friend.\u2019 \u201cI\u2019ve heard that over, and over, and over again, and it haunts me.\u201d The paper\u2019s staff, some of whom have spent the best part of their lives at the Vindicator, have also been hit hard. \u201cMy identity is the Vindicator. Without the newspaper I have no identity in the community,\u201d said Bertram de Souza, the paper\u2019s editorial page editor and columnist. De Souza, 69, has worked at the Vindicator for more than 40 years, and was the paper\u2019s first non-white politics writer. He moved to the US from Uganda when he was 19 years old, after then president Idi Amin expelled Asian people from the country, and eventually moved to Youngstown for the job. \u201cI\u2019m going to leave town. Without the Vindicator I don\u2019t have a compelling reason to live in Youngstown,\u201d De Souza said. \u201cFor me to keep living in Youngstown, not being associated with the newspaper makes no sense. I could live anywhere in the world,\u201d De Souza said. The Vindicator became known for tackling the mafia and corrupt officials. The work of De Souza and other reporters in the late 1980s contributed to almost 70 elected officials, mafia members and businesspeople being convicted of criminal acts. Despite the quality of the coverage, sales have declined over the past four decades. From selling 100,000 copies in the late 1970s \u2013 160,000 on Sundays \u2013 the Vindicator is now down to 25,000 editions daily, and 32,000 on Sunday. The paper has lost money for 20 of the last 22 years, Brown said, with a family fund covering the losses. Brown hoped to ultimately sell the Vindicator, but no buyers were forthcoming. He explored a paywall, but the numbers didn\u2019t work. Neither did making the Vindicator online-only. \u201cThe demise of newspapers, I think, is scary for any democracy.

      "body": "<p>On Wednesday, Cardinal George Pell lost his appeal to overturn a conviction of child sexual assault.</p> <p>Chief Justice Anne Ferguson, Justice Chris Maxwell and Justice Mark Weinberg of the Victorian supreme court <a href=\"http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/vic/VSCA//2019/186.html\">published their reasons in a 323-page judgment</a>, along with a seven-page summary.</p> <p>Ferguson and Maxwell found that the jury\u2019s initial verdict was not unreasonable, while Weinberg, in dissent, said it should be overturned. Below are the excerpts that best summarise why and how that judgment was reached.</p> <h2>Background</h2> <p>Pell was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/feb/26/five-times-guilty-how-george-pells-child-abusing-past-caught-up-with-him-in-courtroom-43\">found guilty in February</a> of child sexual assault and his team appealed the decision on three grounds. The first, and most important, ground was that the jury\u2019s conviction was unreasonable and could not be supported by the evidence.</p> <p>If the judges found this was the case, they could have quashed Pell\u2019s conviction. Instead, on Wednesday, they dismissed this appeal by two to one.</p> <p>The second and third grounds were that Pell\u2019s defence team should have been able to show a 19-minute animation in their closing address, and that Pell should have been able to enter his plea before the jury in person, rather than via video link. These two were dismissed by all three judges unanimously.</p> <p>In making their decision, the judges watched more than 30 hours of video recordings, and read 2,000 pages of interview transcripts, while also visiting St Patrick\u2019s Cathedral in the same way the jury did.</p> <h2>\u2018A witness of truth\u2019</h2> <p>Ferguson and Maxwell found the victim was credible. In their judgment, he is described only as \u201cA\u201d.</p> <p>Pell\u2019s defence team made two arguments: that the victim was \u201ca cunning and calculating liar\u201d who made things up to fill gaps in his story, and that his testimony \u201cwas all a fantasy, a product of his imagination\u201d.</p> <p>In their summary, the justices described him as \u201ca very compelling witness, [who] was clearly not a liar, was not a fantasist and was a witness of truth\u201d.</p> <p>In their judgment they went into more detail, saying that: \u201cWe saw nothing in A\u2019s answers under cross-examination to suggest that he had been caught out or had tripped himself up. And, where his responses involved any alteration of \u2013 or addition to \u2013 what he had said previously, the changes seemed to us to be typical of what occurs when a person is questioned on successive occasions, by different people, about events from the distant past.</p> <p>\u201cA further indication of A\u2019s credibility, in our view, was his admitted uncertainty about a number of matters, which, if the story had been invented or was an entrenched fantasy, he might have been expected to describe with confidence.</p> <p>\u201cStriking examples of this were: his uncertainty about whether Cardinal Pell closed the door in the first incident; his lack of recall as to whether he had screamed or called out during the first incident; and his uncertainty about which hand Cardinal Pell had used in the second incident.</p> <p>\u201cA said he could not recall whether it was closed or not. He thought it was not \u2018wide open\u2019. In our view, the jury could properly reason that a person fabricating a story would have been more likely to say that the door was closed.</p> <p>\u201cTo similar effect was A\u2019s evidence that Cardinal Pell had not ordered the boys to keep quiet about the first incident. This might also be thought to be somewhat surprising. A juror might well have assumed that, if such conduct had occurred, the perpetrator would have been likely to threaten the victims into silence \u2026 In final address, senior counsel for Cardinal Pell submitted that, if it were a true story, Cardinal Pell would have taken the boys to his office and locked the door.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4127bd6c7747ca8110fe151390c208f6c67f9333\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4127bd6c7747ca8110fe151390c208f6c67f9333/0_280_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"George Pell departs the supreme court of Victoria.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">George Pell departs the supreme court of Victoria.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefan Postles/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201c[But] in our view, the jury were also entitled to view this aspect of A\u2019s account as supportive, rather than destructive, of his credibility. The fact that his account of the incident did not include the making of any such threat tended against the contention that he had made it up.\u201d</p> <h2>The wine and the sacristy</h2> <p>The victim recalled two specific details that the judges found convincing.</p> <p>\u201cThe credibility of his account was considerably enhanced by the accuracy of his description of the priests\u2019 sacristy. He was able to describe in some detail the layout and furnishing of the alcove where he and B were discovered by Cardinal Pell. As the Crown pointed out, A correctly placed the wine area in the alcove, not where it is currently located.</p> <p>\u201cMore striking still was the fact that A identified the priests\u2019 sacristy as the setting. At all other times, Cardinal Pell would have robed \u2013 and disrobed \u2013 in the archbishop\u2019s sacristy. Exceptionally, however, that sacristy was temporarily unavailable at the end of 1996 because its furniture was under repair. As a result, Cardinal Pell was \u2013 at the time of the alleged offending \u2013 having to use the priests\u2019 sacristy to disrobe after mass.\u201d</p> <h2>The robes were \u2018capable of being manoeuvred\u2019</h2> <p>Part of Pell\u2019s appeal was that it was physically impossible for him to move his heavy cardinal\u2019s robes in the way the victim alleged.</p> <p>His defence produced evidence from the prefect of ceremonies, Charles Portelli, and the sacristan Maxwell Potter that it was not possible to pull the cardinal\u2019s robes to the side.</p> <p>The jury had access to the robes and found they could be moved. Ferguson and Maxwell said this was reasonable \u2013 even with the cincture \u201cfirmly tied at the waist\u201d. They said in their summary: \u201cThe robes were an exhibit at the trial and had been available to the jury in the jury room during their deliberation.</p> <p>\u201cHaving taken advantage of the opportunity to feel the weight of the robes and assess their manoeuvrability as garments, the chief justice and Justice Maxwell decided that it was well open to the jury to reject the contention of physical impossibility.</p> <p>\u201cThe robes were not so heavy nor so immoveable as the evidence of Monsignor Portelli and Mr Potter had suggested. The chief justice and Justice Maxwell found that the robes were capable of being manoeuvred in a way that might be described as being moved or pulled to one side or pulled apart.\u201d</p> <h2>Not improbable enough</h2> <p>Pell\u2019s defence also argued that it was improbable that the abuse could have occurred in such a public place. Ferguson and Maxwell said though it was unlikely, there was not enough improbability to overturn the jury\u2019s decision.</p> <p>\u201cThese were powerful arguments. It was, of course, highly improbable that someone in Cardinal Pell\u2019s position would have acted in the way alleged \u2026 There was a high risk of discovery; there was a high risk that one or other of the boys would cry out; and there was a high risk that they would report him. The risk to his reputation, and position, was enormous.\u201d</p> <p>However, the judges made reference to other cases, where priests and teachers committed assaults in their offices, in front of other people who could have detected them, and even in class.</p> <p>\u201cAs is illustrated by the proven allegations of repeat offending by a high-profile defendant in Hughes v The Queen, sexual offending does sometimes take place in circumstances carrying a high risk of detection.</p> <p>\u201cThis jury rejected the improbability arguments. In our view, it was reasonably open to them to do so. We are not persuaded that there was anything about A\u2019s account of the incidents which was so inherently improbable as to require the jury to entertain a doubt.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018Reservations about the reliability of Portelli\u2019s answers\u2019</h2> <p>The defence also appealed that the timing was impossible, relying on the evidence of Portelli.</p> <p>Pell\u2019s team argued he was \u201cnever left alone while he was robed and that on 15 and 22 December 1996 he remained on the cathedral steps after mass talking to parishioners, such that he could not have been in the priests\u2019 sacristy as alleged\u201d.</p> <p>But Ferguson and Maxwell found that Portelli\u2019s evidence did not necessarily contradict the victim\u2019s, or make it impossible.</p> <p>\u201c[Portelli] did not have any independent recollection of the particular Sundays in December 1996.

      "bodyText": "On Wednesday, Cardinal George Pell lost his appeal to overturn a conviction of child sexual assault. Chief Justice Anne Ferguson, Justice Chris Maxwell and Justice Mark Weinberg of the Victorian supreme court published their reasons in a 323-page judgment, along with a seven-page summary. Ferguson and Maxwell found that the jury\u2019s initial verdict was not unreasonable, while Weinberg, in dissent, said it should be overturned. Below are the excerpts that best summarise why and how that judgment was reached. Background Pell was found guilty in February of child sexual assault and his team appealed the decision on three grounds. The first, and most important, ground was that the jury\u2019s conviction was unreasonable and could not be supported by the evidence. If the judges found this was the case, they could have quashed Pell\u2019s conviction. Instead, on Wednesday, they dismissed this appeal by two to one. The second and third grounds were that Pell\u2019s defence team should have been able to show a 19-minute animation in their closing address, and that Pell should have been able to enter his plea before the jury in person, rather than via video link. These two were dismissed by all three judges unanimously. In making their decision, the judges watched more than 30 hours of video recordings, and read 2,000 pages of interview transcripts, while also visiting St Patrick\u2019s Cathedral in the same way the jury did. \u2018A witness of truth\u2019 Ferguson and Maxwell found the victim was credible. In their judgment, he is described only as \u201cA\u201d. Pell\u2019s defence team made two arguments: that the victim was \u201ca cunning and calculating liar\u201d who made things up to fill gaps in his story, and that his testimony \u201cwas all a fantasy, a product of his imagination\u201d. In their summary, the justices described him as \u201ca very compelling witness, [who] was clearly not a liar, was not a fantasist and was a witness of truth\u201d. In their judgment they went into more detail, saying that: \u201cWe saw nothing in A\u2019s answers under cross-examination to suggest that he had been caught out or had tripped himself up. And, where his responses involved any alteration of \u2013 or addition to \u2013 what he had said previously, the changes seemed to us to be typical of what occurs when a person is questioned on successive occasions, by different people, about events from the distant past. \u201cA further indication of A\u2019s credibility, in our view, was his admitted uncertainty about a number of matters, which, if the story had been invented or was an entrenched fantasy, he might have been expected to describe with confidence. \u201cStriking examples of this were: his uncertainty about whether Cardinal Pell closed the door in the first incident; his lack of recall as to whether he had screamed or called out during the first incident; and his uncertainty about which hand Cardinal Pell had used in the second incident. \u201cA said he could not recall whether it was closed or not. He thought it was not \u2018wide open\u2019. In our view, the jury could properly reason that a person fabricating a story would have been more likely to say that the door was closed. \u201cTo similar effect was A\u2019s evidence that Cardinal Pell had not ordered the boys to keep quiet about the first incident. This might also be thought to be somewhat surprising. A juror might well have assumed that, if such conduct had occurred, the perpetrator would have been likely to threaten the victims into silence \u2026 In final address, senior counsel for Cardinal Pell submitted that, if it were a true story, Cardinal Pell would have taken the boys to his office and locked the door. \u201c[But] in our view, the jury were also entitled to view this aspect of A\u2019s account as supportive, rather than destructive, of his credibility. The fact that his account of the incident did not include the making of any such threat tended against the contention that he had made it up.\u201d The wine and the sacristy The victim recalled two specific details that the judges found convincing. \u201cThe credibility of his account was considerably enhanced by the accuracy of his description of the priests\u2019 sacristy. He was able to describe in some detail the layout and furnishing of the alcove where he and B were discovered by Cardinal Pell. As the Crown pointed out, A correctly placed the wine area in the alcove, not where it is currently located. \u201cMore striking still was the fact that A identified the priests\u2019 sacristy as the setting. At all other times, Cardinal Pell would have robed \u2013 and disrobed \u2013 in the archbishop\u2019s sacristy. Exceptionally, however, that sacristy was temporarily unavailable at the end of 1996 because its furniture was under repair. As a result, Cardinal Pell was \u2013 at the time of the alleged offending \u2013 having to use the priests\u2019 sacristy to disrobe after mass.\u201d The robes were \u2018capable of being manoeuvred\u2019 Part of Pell\u2019s appeal was that it was physically impossible for him to move his heavy cardinal\u2019s robes in the way the victim alleged. His defence produced evidence from the prefect of ceremonies, Charles Portelli, and the sacristan Maxwell Potter that it was not possible to pull the cardinal\u2019s robes to the side. The jury had access to the robes and found they could be moved. Ferguson and Maxwell said this was reasonable \u2013 even with the cincture \u201cfirmly tied at the waist\u201d. They said in their summary: \u201cThe robes were an exhibit at the trial and had been available to the jury in the jury room during their deliberation. \u201cHaving taken advantage of the opportunity to feel the weight of the robes and assess their manoeuvrability as garments, the chief justice and Justice Maxwell decided that it was well open to the jury to reject the contention of physical impossibility. \u201cThe robes were not so heavy nor so immoveable as the evidence of Monsignor Portelli and Mr Potter had suggested. The chief justice and Justice Maxwell found that the robes were capable of being manoeuvred in a way that might be described as being moved or pulled to one side or pulled apart.\u201d Not improbable enough Pell\u2019s defence also argued that it was improbable that the abuse could have occurred in such a public place. Ferguson and Maxwell said though it was unlikely, there was not enough improbability to overturn the jury\u2019s decision. \u201cThese were powerful arguments. It was, of course, highly improbable that someone in Cardinal Pell\u2019s position would have acted in the way alleged \u2026 There was a high risk of discovery; there was a high risk that one or other of the boys would cry out; and there was a high risk that they would report him. The risk to his reputation, and position, was enormous.\u201d However, the judges made reference to other cases, where priests and teachers committed assaults in their offices, in front of other people who could have detected them, and even in class. \u201cAs is illustrated by the proven allegations of repeat offending by a high-profile defendant in Hughes v The Queen, sexual offending does sometimes take place in circumstances carrying a high risk of detection. \u201cThis jury rejected the improbability arguments. In our view, it was reasonably open to them to do so. We are not persuaded that there was anything about A\u2019s account of the incidents which was so inherently improbable as to require the jury to entertain a doubt.\u201d \u2018Reservations about the reliability of Portelli\u2019s answers\u2019 The defence also appealed that the timing was impossible, relying on the evidence of Portelli. Pell\u2019s team argued he was \u201cnever left alone while he was robed and that on 15 and 22 December 1996 he remained on the cathedral steps after mass talking to parishioners, such that he could not have been in the priests\u2019 sacristy as alleged\u201d. But Ferguson and Maxwell found that Portelli\u2019s evidence did not necessarily contradict the victim\u2019s, or make it impossible. \u201c[Portelli] did not have any independent recollection of the particular Sundays in December 1996. Although he had affirmed propositions put to him in cross-examination, he could not \u2013 unprompted \u2013 answer questions about those occasions. \u201cIn our view, Portelli\u2019s evidence \u2013 taken as a whole \u2013 did not compel the jury to have a doubt about A\u2019s evidence. On the contrary, in our view, the jury were entitled to have reservations about the reliability of Portelli\u2019s affirmative answers under cross-examination. \u201cPortelli properly accepted the possibility that Cardinal Pell might on occasion have stayed on the cathedral steps only \u2018for a short period of time before returning to the sacristy\u2019. He also accepted that there may have been occasions on which he did not himself accompany the cardinal back to his sacristy after mass and that, even if he had escorted the cardinal back, he might not have gone into the priests\u2019 sacristy with him. \u201cThe jury were entitled to view those answers, and the evidence more generally, as leaving open the realistic possibility that Cardinal Pell was \u2018alone in the sacristies only a few minutes after the end of mass\u2019. It was possible that on either 15 or 22 December 1996 he did not stay on the front steps for long.\u201d The dissent However, Weinberg took a different view, both on the credibility of the victim, the credibility of Portelli and the issue of improbability. Compounding probabilities Weinberg wrote that while these events were possible, multiplying their improbability made the sequence of events so unlikely as to overturn the decision. \u201c[Pell\u2019s team] submitted that each and every one of a number of independently \u2018impossible\u2019 things would had to have occurred within the very same limited time period (10 minutes or so) if the complainant\u2019s account were to be accepted. \u201cIn that event, the odds against the complainant\u2019s account of how the abuse had occurred would have to be substantial. The chances of \u2018all the planets aligning\u2019, in that way, would, at the very least, be doubtful. \u201cThis form of \u2018probabilistic analysis\u2019, if properly applied, suggests strongly to me that the jury, acting reasonably, on the whole of the evidence in this case, ought to have had a reasonable doubt as to the applicant\u2019s guilt.\u201d \u2018Proven cases of \u201cfalse memory\u201d\u2019 Weinberg wrote that the victim\u2019s testimony was unreliable. In his summary, he said the victim \u201cwas inclined to embellish aspects of his account\u201d and that \u201chis evidence contained discrepancies [and] displayed inadequacies\u201d. In his judgment, he said: \u201cOn occasion, he seemed almost to \u2018clutch at straws\u2019 in an attempt to minimise, or overcome, the obvious inconsistencies between what he had said on earlier occasions, and what the objective evidence clearly showed. \u201cThere are proven cases of \u2018false memory\u2019 of that kind, including, in particular, in relation to sexual offending. The recent decision of this court in Tyrrell provides a classic illustration of an apparently compelling witness whose account had to involve a substantial measure of complete fantasy. \u201cNor can it be doubted that some complainants in cases involving sexual abuse, including of children, have fabricated their allegations. Just within the past few weeks, a major scandal involving false allegations of that kind has erupted in England, and received enormous publicity. \u201cHaving had regard to the whole of the evidence led at trial, and having deliberated long and hard over this matter, I find myself in the position of having a genuine doubt as to the applicant\u2019s guilt.\u201d Second incident \u2018implausible\u2019 In his summary, Weinberg that the second incident especially \u2013 where it was claimed Pell grabbed the victim\u2019s genitals as he passed him in the corridor \u2013 was \u201centirely implausible\u201d. In his judgment he expanded: \u201cIt is clear that some sexual offenders commit their crimes in a manner that can properly be described as almost \u2018breathtaking in its brazenness\u2019. Teachers have been known to molest their pupils in the classroom, and even while in the presence of other students. \u201cEven so, the complainant\u2019s account of the second incident seems to me to take brazenness to new heights, the like of which I have not seen. \u201cTo be clear, as I have previously indicated, I see nothing inherently improbable in the allegation that a senior cleric, of whatever denomination, would sexually abuse a child.

That means that, in my respectful opinion, these convictions cannot be permitted to stand. The only order that can properly be made is that the applicant be acquitted on each charge.\u201d The divide over Portelli In coming to that conclusion, Weinberg differed from Ferguson and Maxwell about the reliability of Portelli \u2013 as well as other witnesses for Pell. The summary of the judgment said that the weight of other \u201ccogent\u201d and \u201cimpressive\u201d evidence against the witness made the conviction unreasonable for Weinberg. \u201cIf the complainant\u2019s evidence was the only evidence, [Weinberg] might well have found it difficult to say that the jury, acting reasonably, were \u2018bound\u2019 to have a reasonable doubt about the cardinal\u2019s guilt. [Weinberg] went on to note, however, that there was more than just the complainant\u2019s evidence. \u201cIn Justice Weinberg\u2019s view there was a significant body of cogent and, in some cases, impressive evidence suggesting that the complainant\u2019s account was, in a realistic sense, \u2018impossible\u2019 to accept.\u201d The animation and the video link All three judges agreed that the appeal over the animation and the video link should be dismissed. They wrote in their summary that \u201cthe animation bore little resemblance to the actual state of the evidence but rather presented a distorted picture of that evidence\u201d. \u201cIt showed the priests\u2019 sacristy, with the complainant and the other boy in the room, in company with a large number of concelebrant priests.

Two of three judges on the appeals court bench in Victoria, Australia, threw out his lawyers\u2019 contention that a jury acted unreasonably when it found him guilty of molesting two choirboys in the mid-1990s. Two other grounds of appeal were dismissed unanimously. As David Marr writes, Pell \u201cdidn\u2019t flinch\u201d as the verdict was delivered. \u201cHis lips pursed a little as he stared at the judges \u2026 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/aug/21/at-the-verdict-george-pell-pursed-his-lips-he-was-going-back-to-prison\">he was going back to jail</a>.\u201d</p> <p>Pell ran the Vatican\u2019s finances until he was charged. He may be able to appeal to Australia\u2019s high court \u2013 otherwise he will remain in jail until at least October 2022. Through his lawyer, Vivian Waller, Pell\u2019s surviving victim <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/aug/21/victim-advocates-cheer-as-pell-appeal-rejected-hallelujah-proof-there-is-a-god\">said he was relieved by the decision</a>. \u201cAfter attending the funeral of my childhood friend, the other choirboy, I felt a responsibility to come forward. I knew he had been in a dark place. I was in a dark place. I gave a statement to the police because I was thinking of him and his family.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>Secret US-Maduro talks \u2013 </strong>Nicol\u00e1s Maduro has confirmed \u201cvarious contacts through various channels\u201d between <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/21/venezuelan-leader-nicolas-maduro-confirms-months-of-secret-us-talks\">top Venezuelan officials and members of Donald Trump\u2019s White House</a>.

Cardinal George Pell has lost an appeal against his conviction for child sexual assault, meaning he remains the most senior Catholic official in the world found guilty of such offences. Two of three judges on the appeals court bench in Victoria, Australia, threw out his lawyers\u2019 contention that a jury acted unreasonably when it found him guilty of molesting two choirboys in the mid-1990s. Two other grounds of appeal were dismissed unanimously. As David Marr writes, Pell \u201cdidn\u2019t flinch\u201d as the verdict was delivered. \u201cHis lips pursed a little as he stared at the judges \u2026 he was going back to jail.\u201d Pell ran the Vatican\u2019s finances until he was charged. He may be able to appeal to Australia\u2019s high court \u2013 otherwise he will remain in jail until at least October 2022. Through his lawyer, Vivian Waller, Pell\u2019s surviving victim said he was relieved by the decision. \u201cAfter attending the funeral of my childhood friend, the other choirboy, I felt a responsibility to come forward. I knew he had been in a dark place. I was in a dark place.

      "body": "<p>There\u2019s a well-travelled road from boy- or girlband glory to solo success. So why shouldn\u2019t it be open to alumni of the drag queen quintet Denim? Crystal Rasmussen sings in that supergroup and now turns their memoir <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2019/feb/03/crystal-rasmussen-diary-of-a-drag-queen\">Diary of a Drag Queen</a> into a fringe show. It charts the life stories of Crystal \u2013 a Romanov who fled the Bolsheviks to be raised by wolves \u2013 and their alter ego Tom, a gender nonconforming boy in Lancashire, struggling to live a life without shame. They meet; they help one another; they become one \u2013 with costume changes and powerpop cover versions en route.</p> <p>The twin-track narrative is a nice conceit, and it\u2019s thrilling when they come together \u2013 by which stage, Crystal is married to seventh husband Mr Blobby and Tom is listening to Madonna on the school bus while being pelted with oranges. (The homophobia they experience gets worse, and is shocking.) Then the distinction between the two personae blurs, as Rasmussen reads from chapters of his memoir representing their various stations of their cross. Kate Bush, Madge herself and Minnie Riperton \u2013 if not quite with her signature top note \u2013 help the story along its way.</p> <p>Finally, it tells a conventional story of an unconventional life, as Rasmussen\u2019s \u201ctechniques to conquer shame and violence\u201d are revealed to be self-acceptance and \u201cvaluing all the parts of myself\u201d.

      "bodyText": "There\u2019s a well-travelled road from boy- or girlband glory to solo success. So why shouldn\u2019t it be open to alumni of the drag queen quintet Denim? Crystal Rasmussen sings in that supergroup and now turns their memoir Diary of a Drag Queen into a fringe show. It charts the life stories of Crystal \u2013 a Romanov who fled the Bolsheviks to be raised by wolves \u2013 and their alter ego Tom, a gender nonconforming boy in Lancashire, struggling to live a life without shame. They meet; they help one another; they become one \u2013 with costume changes and powerpop cover versions en route. The twin-track narrative is a nice conceit, and it\u2019s thrilling when they come together \u2013 by which stage, Crystal is married to seventh husband Mr Blobby and Tom is listening to Madonna on the school bus while being pelted with oranges. (The homophobia they experience gets worse, and is shocking.) Then the distinction between the two personae blurs, as Rasmussen reads from chapters of his memoir representing their various stations of their cross. Kate Bush, Madge herself and Minnie Riperton \u2013 if not quite with her signature top note \u2013 help the story along its way. Finally, it tells a conventional story of an unconventional life, as Rasmussen\u2019s \u201ctechniques to conquer shame and violence\u201d are revealed to be self-acceptance and \u201cvaluing all the parts of myself\u201d. (This is the kind of show where the performer is cheered for putting on a string of pearls.) The glamorous aspirations sometimes chafe against the lo-fi staging, and Rasmussen writhing semi-nude in a paddling pool brings little to the party. But they\u2019ve got charisma by the bucketful, and a falsetto that slices to the heart. \u2022 At Underbelly Cowgate, Edinburgh, until 25 August. \u2022 Read all our Edinburgh festival reviews.",

There are Moko Jumbies, who walk down Port of Spain\u2019s Frederick Street on stilts, collecting money from the people watching on balconies. There are Blue Devils, hailing from the village of Paramin, who paint their skin blue and extort money from the crowd. (Woe betide anyone who is short of change \u2013 they are famously terrifying.) The Midnight Robbers hold passersby up at fake gunpoint and deliver long, improvised speeches. And the rambunctious Pissenlit \u2013 meaning wet the bed \u2013 run around in rags soaked in urine or menstrual blood.</p> \n<p>All this revelry has a purpose. \u201cMas is a mentality, a way of understanding who we are and where we stand,\u201d says Trinidadian scholar Kevin Adonis Browne, author of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/High-Mas-Carnival-Poetics-Caribbean/dp/1496819381\">High Mas: Carnival and the Poetics of Caribbean Culture</a><em>.</em> Because mas came out of slavery, a transgressive critique of white imperialism is inherent in the performance. \u201cDuring the 19th century, the planter class had their balls,\u201d Browne explains. \u201cThey\u2019d exclude slaves or, later on, free blacks or indentured servants. Mas was a mirror image of the masquerades these people had seen the bourgeois performing, but also a critical reflection. It\u2019s a paradoxical engagement with race, class, and politics, and a push-pull embrace and rejection of official culture, western sensibilities, or whiteness.\u201d</p> \n<p>Carnival doesn\u2019t start when the first floats line the road. Preparations begin months earlier, at mas camps. \u201cIt\u2019s a social space,\u201d says Browne. \u201cIt\u2019s where you reinforce the ideologies of mas and carnival. It\u2019s where history is shared, where ideas are passed down.\u201d</p> \n<p>Mas camps were imported to the UK in the 1960s. Before her first carnival, Allyson spent weeks making papier-mache hats. \u201cIt was like that traditional mas camp requirement,\u201d she says with a chuckle. \u201cIf you went to a mas camp, you ended up working! Someone always put something in your hand that you had to do.\u201d</p> \n<p>For Melissa Simon-Hartman, being part of a mas camp changed her life. Assisting Meilin Sancho of the <a href=\"http://www.elimu-archive.uk/\">Elimu Carnival Band</a> led to a career as <a href=\"https://www.simon-hartman.com/\">a costume designer</a>. \u201cI used to follow Sancho around everywhere,\u201d Simon-Hartman says in her kitchen in Bedford. \u201cI wanted to glitter and decorate things for her. I was totally enamoured with her.\u201d </p> \n<p>At her first Notting Hill, Simon-Hartman \u2013 then seven \u2013 played a Jab Molassie, one of the oldest carnival characters. Usually smeared with tar, mud, grease, or coloured paint (the Blue Devils are a variant), the Jab Molassies are devils that will drag you to hell. \u201cIt was heavenly,\u201d she says. \u201cI was depressed when it was over. I cried for a very long time after carnival.\u201d (She wouldn\u2019t be alone \u2013 in Trinidad, \u201ccarnival tabanca\u201d refers to the heartache revellers feel when carnival is over.)</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"06c5cc87225ab80eec7fea44237267f41559f765\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/06c5cc87225ab80eec7fea44237267f41559f765/0_204_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Melissa Simon-Hartman with her Sea Flower costume in Bedford.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Melissa Simon-Hartman with her Sea Flower costume, made of belly-dancing costume fabric.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Robertson/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>She leads me past an enormous Sea Flower costume that takes up most of the hallway. \u201cThe actual fabric is belly-dancing material,\u201d Simon-Hartman says, fingering the pink and purple skirt. It is gossamer-thin and wired out from a waistband to resemble the petals of a brilliant tropical flower.</p> \n<p>In her studio, her assistants Raveena Flora and Rosemary Barrett, are busy at work. Sewing machines rattle, glue guns lie around, and mannequins weighted in beads and pearls stare back at me. This year, Simon-Hartman is producing 28 costumes for four bands, including Elimu \u2013 and she\u2019s doing things differently. \u201cLook,\u201d she says with a laugh, throwing her hands up. \u201cI have no issues with feathers \u2013 I don\u2019t want anyone coming after me \u2013 but I like to experiment with texture. So if someone wants feathers, I look for something I can replicate a feather with, but in an alternate material.\u201d She laser-cut packaging material to resemble feathers, so another band won\u2019t turn up wearing the same plumage.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5f3998293cdd6f08563204d6c964c3dd1a76220a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5f3998293cdd6f08563204d6c964c3dd1a76220a/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Simon-Hartman\u2019s assistant Raveena Flora working on the Dreams of Oshun costume.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Simon-Hartman\u2019s assistant Raveena Flora working on the Dreams of Oshun costume.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Robertson/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>As a girl in Trinidad, one of Allyson Williams\u2019s earliest memories is of watching her father shake out a voluminous, Elizabethan-themed costume. \u201cHe was a courtier, or something like that,\u201d she says, her eyes brightening. \u201cHe had this elaborate costume with huge sleeves, and panels, and puffy pants in all these beautiful colours. I\u2019d reach out to touch them, and think, if I touch this, will it rub off, or will it shine more?\u201d</p> \n<p>Her husband Vernon founded Genesis, now one of Notting Hill\u2019s most long-standing bands, in 1980, and the Williams family has become a venerable carnival institution: a dynasty of floats and foam, all set to the pounding of soca drums. \u201cI was lucky that my husband was a fellow Trinidadian, so we could show them what carnival was all about,\u201d says Allyson. \u201cI am so proud that my children took to it and embraced it.\u201d</p> \n<p>Vernon died in 2002, and carnival was difficult that year. \u201c I cried all the time,\u201d says Allyson. To complicate matters, Vernon had arranged for Genesis to perform as part of the Queen\u2019s golden jubilee celebrations. \u201cIt was all arranged,\u201d Allyson recalls. \u201cThey called us to ask, are you doing this? He died two weeks before the jubilee. Everyone said, \u2018Let\u2019s do it as a tribute to him.\u2019\u201d The band wore T-shirts with Vernon\u2019s face on them, and paraded down the Mall. I put it to Allyson that the story of her relationship with Vernon is also the story of Notting Hill Carnival. \u201cIt was lovely \u2013 wonderful,\u201d she says. \u201cI remember everything about him with such fondness, including the carnival.\u201d</p> \n<p><a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/3576100.stm\">After his death</a>, their daughter Symone Williams-Nelson took over as band leader, with Allyson heavily involved in coordinating and producing the costumes. This year the band\u2019s theme is Afro spice: Symone designed a print or it that is based on the motif of the Luba tribe from central Africa.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"be7fe7cafd6d44b2cc89d2c30e041c2c5275f0c3\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/be7fe7cafd6d44b2cc89d2c30e041c2c5275f0c3/0_0_3660_2349/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson when he was mayor of London with members of the carnival mas band Genesis.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"642\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson when he was mayor of London with members of the carnival mas band Genesis.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Allyson hopes to inspire a new breed of mas costume designers to reconnect with carnival\u2019s rich history. But the historic traditions of mas are being replaced with so-called pretty mas, which is more popular today and has extravagantly beautiful costumes \u2013 bright colours, sequins, and beading \u2013 but they don\u2019t represent characters or themes. \u201cA lot of bands in recent years have gone for feathers and bikinis and beads,\u201d Allyson says with a sigh. \u201cThey felt that the interpretation of historical themes was probably a bit heavy. But I\u2019m all feathered out at the moment.\u201d</p> \n<p>As pretty mas comes to dominate, mas camps are counted out. \u201cThat has died,\u201d says Simon-Hartman, who is a freelance costume designer. \u201cThere\u2019s not many bands left that have mas camps you can visit.\u201d Unless there\u2019s a sudden about-turn, mas camps may be a thing of the past. Browne warns: \u201cThe old performers are dying. Mas as performance culture is under threat of erasure.\u201d</p> \n<p>For now, Allyson and Simon-Hartman will keep the spirit and traditions of carnival where they belong: on the road. Simon-Hartman doesn\u2019t take this privilege for granted. After she was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis in 2001, she feared she\u2019d never design costumes again. But in 2015, she found a medication that allowed her to return to work \u2013 which she did with a flourish, making 40 costumes for Elimu that year. After other bands saw her elaborate handiwork, the orders started coming in.</p> \n<p>Being able to keep doing what Simon-Hartman loves best \u2013 making phantasmagorical costumes that horrify and entrance in equal measure \u2013 is a privilege. \u201cTo me, mas means culture, heritage, street theatre,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s the way I like to look at it. It\u2019s the opportunity to express yourself. It represents freedom.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"04148b58-1cad-4356-aabb-446477311173\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/D9hPWioAl1k?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/nottinghillcarnival\">Notting Hill carnival</a> runs from 24-26 August in London.</p>",

And the rambunctious Pissenlit \u2013 meaning wet the bed \u2013 run around in rags soaked in urine or menstrual blood. All this revelry has a purpose. \u201cMas is a mentality, a way of understanding who we are and where we stand,\u201d says Trinidadian scholar Kevin Adonis Browne, author of High Mas: Carnival and the Poetics of Caribbean Culture. Because mas came out of slavery, a transgressive critique of white imperialism is inherent in the performance. \u201cDuring the 19th century, the planter class had their balls,\u201d Browne explains. \u201cThey\u2019d exclude slaves or, later on, free blacks or indentured servants. Mas was a mirror image of the masquerades these people had seen the bourgeois performing, but also a critical reflection. It\u2019s a paradoxical engagement with race, class, and politics, and a push-pull embrace and rejection of official culture, western sensibilities, or whiteness.\u201d Carnival doesn\u2019t start when the first floats line the road. Preparations begin months earlier, at mas camps. \u201cIt\u2019s a social space,\u201d says Browne. \u201cIt\u2019s where you reinforce the ideologies of mas and carnival. It\u2019s where history is shared, where ideas are passed down.\u201d Mas camps were imported to the UK in the 1960s. Before her first carnival, Allyson spent weeks making papier-mache hats. \u201cIt was like that traditional mas camp requirement,\u201d she says with a chuckle. \u201cIf you went to a mas camp, you ended up working! Someone always put something in your hand that you had to do.\u201d For Melissa Simon-Hartman, being part of a mas camp changed her life. Assisting Meilin Sancho of the Elimu Carnival Band led to a career as a costume designer. \u201cI used to follow Sancho around everywhere,\u201d Simon-Hartman says in her kitchen in Bedford. \u201cI wanted to glitter and decorate things for her. I was totally enamoured with her.\u201d At her first Notting Hill, Simon-Hartman \u2013 then seven \u2013 played a Jab Molassie, one of the oldest carnival characters. Usually smeared with tar, mud, grease, or coloured paint (the Blue Devils are a variant), the Jab Molassies are devils that will drag you to hell. \u201cIt was heavenly,\u201d she says. \u201cI was depressed when it was over. I cried for a very long time after carnival.\u201d (She wouldn\u2019t be alone \u2013 in Trinidad, \u201ccarnival tabanca\u201d refers to the heartache revellers feel when carnival is over.) She leads me past an enormous Sea Flower costume that takes up most of the hallway. \u201cThe actual fabric is belly-dancing material,\u201d Simon-Hartman says, fingering the pink and purple skirt. It is gossamer-thin and wired out from a waistband to resemble the petals of a brilliant tropical flower. In her studio, her assistants Raveena Flora and Rosemary Barrett, are busy at work. Sewing machines rattle, glue guns lie around, and mannequins weighted in beads and pearls stare back at me. This year, Simon-Hartman is producing 28 costumes for four bands, including Elimu \u2013 and she\u2019s doing things differently. \u201cLook,\u201d she says with a laugh, throwing her hands up. \u201cI have no issues with feathers \u2013 I don\u2019t want anyone coming after me \u2013 but I like to experiment with texture. So if someone wants feathers, I look for something I can replicate a feather with, but in an alternate material.\u201d She laser-cut packaging material to resemble feathers, so another band won\u2019t turn up wearing the same plumage. As a girl in Trinidad, one of Allyson Williams\u2019s earliest memories is of watching her father shake out a voluminous, Elizabethan-themed costume. \u201cHe was a courtier, or something like that,\u201d she says, her eyes brightening. \u201cHe had this elaborate costume with huge sleeves, and panels, and puffy pants in all these beautiful colours. I\u2019d reach out to touch them, and think, if I touch this, will it rub off, or will it shine more?\u201d Her husband Vernon founded Genesis, now one of Notting Hill\u2019s most long-standing bands, in 1980, and the Williams family has become a venerable carnival institution: a dynasty of floats and foam, all set to the pounding of soca drums. \u201cI was lucky that my husband was a fellow Trinidadian, so we could show them what carnival was all about,\u201d says Allyson. \u201cI am so proud that my children took to it and embraced it.\u201d Vernon died in 2002, and carnival was difficult that year. \u201c I cried all the time,\u201d says Allyson. To complicate matters, Vernon had arranged for Genesis to perform as part of the Queen\u2019s golden jubilee celebrations. \u201cIt was all arranged,\u201d Allyson recalls. \u201cThey called us to ask, are you doing this? He died two weeks before the jubilee. Everyone said, \u2018Let\u2019s do it as a tribute to him.\u2019\u201d The band wore T-shirts with Vernon\u2019s face on them, and paraded down the Mall. I put it to Allyson that the story of her relationship with Vernon is also the story of Notting Hill Carnival. \u201cIt was lovely \u2013 wonderful,\u201d she says. \u201cI remember everything about him with such fondness, including the carnival.\u201d After his death, their daughter Symone Williams-Nelson took over as band leader, with Allyson heavily involved in coordinating and producing the costumes. This year the band\u2019s theme is Afro spice: Symone designed a print or it that is based on the motif of the Luba tribe from central Africa. Allyson hopes to inspire a new breed of mas costume designers to reconnect with carnival\u2019s rich history. But the historic traditions of mas are being replaced with so-called pretty mas, which is more popular today and has extravagantly beautiful costumes \u2013 bright colours, sequins, and beading \u2013 but they don\u2019t represent characters or themes. \u201cA lot of bands in recent years have gone for feathers and bikinis and beads,\u201d Allyson says with a sigh. \u201cThey felt that the interpretation of historical themes was probably a bit heavy. But I\u2019m all feathered out at the moment.\u201d As pretty mas comes to dominate, mas camps are counted out. \u201cThat has died,\u201d says Simon-Hartman, who is a freelance costume designer. \u201cThere\u2019s not many bands left that have mas camps you can visit.\u201d Unless there\u2019s a sudden about-turn, mas camps may be a thing of the past. Browne warns: \u201cThe old performers are dying. Mas as performance culture is under threat of erasure.\u201d For now, Allyson and Simon-Hartman will keep the spirit and traditions of carnival where they belong: on the road. Simon-Hartman doesn\u2019t take this privilege for granted. After she was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis in 2001, she feared she\u2019d never design costumes again. But in 2015, she found a medication that allowed her to return to work \u2013 which she did with a flourish, making 40 costumes for Elimu that year. After other bands saw her elaborate handiwork, the orders started coming in. Being able to keep doing what Simon-Hartman loves best \u2013 making phantasmagorical costumes that horrify and entrance in equal measure \u2013 is a privilege. \u201cTo me, mas means culture, heritage, street theatre,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s the way I like to look at it. It\u2019s the opportunity to express yourself. It represents freedom.\u201d \u2022 Notting Hill carnival runs from 24-26 August in London.",

The roofs worked so well, why not tackle the roads next?</p> \n<p>Streets make up about 15% of the city\u2019s land, while parks comprise <a href=\"https://www.tpl.org/city/los-angeles-california\">13%</a>. If heat-trapping, car-centric roads are one of LA\u2019s biggest climate problems, they\u2019re also a potential site of intervention.</p> \n<p>But the research on cool street cover leaves some open questions. According to <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778817309908\">a 2017 study</a>, most cool pavement sealants were more resource-intensive than ordinary paving material. There\u2019s also concern that staining on white roads could counteract their benefits. Alternatively, if they stay fresh and bright, some fear they could actually reflect the hot sun back at unsuspecting residents.</p> \n<p>Still, Spotts is undeterred. \u201cThe street is made of the same stuff it\u2019s been made of since World War II,\u201d said Spotts. \u201cWe think it\u2019s time for cities and suppliers to experiment.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>Water</strong></h2> \n<p>Permeable pavement is a far more subtle addition to LA\u2019s climate resiliency schemes than cooling landcover. Unlike a gleaming white-coated street, the porous pavement and bioswales that catch and filter runoff don\u2019t look like anything special. The dry wells that capture that water for reuse blend entirely into the urban landscape.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"50e09b4185521f4af213c353924e98d4e8a4f754\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/50e09b4185521f4af213c353924e98d4e8a4f754/0_0_3456_5184/667.jpg\" alt=\"Porous pavement and bioswales capture and filter rainwater and runoff.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Porous pavement and bioswales capture and filter rainwater and runoff.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Susie Cagle/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>On a tour of water-capturing green infrastructure, Kevin Ho, an LA city sanitation engineer, pointed to two metal covers set into the road, several feet in front of a massive storm drain. \u201cWhen it rains, it\u2019s like opening up a fire hydrant and pointing it down into the dry well \u2013 it just collects it all,\u201d said Ho. \u201cIf possible, we would just put dry wells throughout the city.\u201d</p> \n<p>In a partnership between the City Department of Water and Power, the Bureau of Sanitation and California State Coastal Conservancy, these experimental projects have been distributed across a handful of major thoroughfares and small residential side streets, with the goal of increasing local water security and reducing local heat.</p> \n<p>The mayor\u2019s resilience plan calls for water infrastructure that \u201cwill ensure the city is prepared to handle both extreme wet and extreme dry years\u201d. Right now, LA county gets 41% of its water from local underground aquifers and recycling \u2013 the goal is 50% by 2025. Permeable pavement, bioswales and dry wells can make the city better adapted to arid periods, and make flood-prone neighborhoods more <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-ln-mega-storm-dam-failure-20190218-story.html\">resilient to superstorms</a>.</p> \n<p>The distributed stormwater capture project in the San Fernando Valley stands to collect enough water to serve around 1,200 families per year. It\u2019s a literal drop in the bucket, but the initiative is still in an early stage.</p> \n<p>\u201cThese projects are so spotty, and they\u2019re at all different levels of green,\u201d said Kara Kemmler, a coastal conservancy project manager.</p> \n<p>\u201cI would love to see some more trees,\u201d lamented Kemmler. \u201cSo you have that water capture, but create some shade, some carbon sequestration, some urban heat island mitigation while you have the opportunity. \u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>Shade</strong></h2> \n<p>Creamy asphalt sealant lowers the surface temperature of a road roughly 10F. But the shade from a mature, leafy tree can provide more like 40-50F (22-28C) of cooling power, on top of sequestering<strong> </strong>carbon.</p> \n<p>\u201cBy and large the literature is kind of mixed on which one is \u2018better\u2019 \u2013 I\u2019m a firm believer that we\u2019ve got to do both,\u201d said Edith de Guzman, executive director of the nonprofit Tree People.</p> \n<p>Trees seem to be the obvious adaptation fix to cool a city, recapture water runoff and increase local carbon capture. Earlier this month, the mayor\u2019s office appointed <a href=\"https://www.lamayor.org/mayor-garcetti-names-rachel-malarich-la%E2%80%99s-first-ever-city-forest-officer\">LA\u2019s first forest officer</a> to oversee increasing the city\u2019s canopy by at least 50% by 2028 in areas that currently have the least shade.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s all manner of state or other funding sources that will allow for tree planting to occur. But this is an asset that needs to be maintained,\u201d said de Guzman.</p> \n<p>Instead of unilaterally taking on the project of greening LA, Tree People trains those who want to green their own neighborhoods, thus creating a network of tree-passionate planters and waterers.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ad92c2ebe7a04573652316f2fad42cfd238aafa1\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ad92c2ebe7a04573652316f2fad42cfd238aafa1/0_170_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Greater tree coverage would also reduce temperatures; LA\u2019s first forest officer was recently appointed to increase the city\u2019s canopy by 50%.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Greater tree coverage would also reduce temperatures; LA\u2019s first forest officer was recently appointed to increase the city\u2019s canopy by 50%.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Susie Cagle/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>But compared to pouring reflective or permeable concrete, or installing a cool roof, planted greenery by its nature conflicts with the gray environment. Planting comes second to vehicle sightlines in the sprawling car-centric metropolis. And over time, the shallow roots on many of LA\u2019s trees have torn up the pavement. The city recently settled a <a href=\"https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2015/04/why-las-14-billion-sidewalk-repair-case-is-such-a-big-deal/389793/\">lawsuit</a> that will require a $1.4bn investment in sidewalk, ramp and crosswalk repairs in order to make them disability-accessible.<strong> </strong>That settlement could provide an opportunity to green the city better by choosing more deep-rooted species.</p> \n<p>LA appears committed to a greener, shadier future \u2013 but the city has fallen short in past efforts to create cool cover. Trees have gone unplanted. Bus shelters have gone unbuilt. The city is losing transit riders to car travel, and climate crisis could only make it worse.</p> \n<p>A pilot at one large northwest valley transit station will create a variety of heat-beating infrastructure to make transit more attractive.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf you knew you\u2019d be completely in the shade, that there was water waiting for you at the train station, wouldn\u2019t that be an easier place for people to take transit?\u201d said Parfrey.</p> \n<h2><strong>The future</strong></h2> \n<p>Just as LA\u2019s critical warming is not evenly distributed, neither are its heat-relieving elements. You can see this green gap in aerial photos of the city: Wealthier neighborhoods are shielded by foliage, while poorer ones are exposed to the sun \u2013 sometimes by design, in order to provide clear sight lines for surveillance cameras.</p> \n<p>The gap in heat-beating infrastructure creates an inequitable distribution of health risk. While the city takes local wealth into account when determining where to install new heat-mitigating infrastructure, intracity inequality is not so easily paved over, from uninsulated buildings to higher proportional energy costs to longer waits at those unsheltered bus stops.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf you want to look at a single issue that separates the haves from the have-nots, it\u2019s heat,\u201d said Shickman. \u201cEvery negative effect of heat hits low income neighborhoods and people of color more.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d5203e335746baf09ed61f03ea52632c525f1ce1\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d5203e335746baf09ed61f03ea52632c525f1ce1/76_3_4779_2867/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Unsheltered bus stops are one factor the city needs to address in order to move people away from cars and increase transit use.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Unsheltered bus stops are one factor the city needs to address in order to move people away from cars and increase transit use.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kathy deWitt/Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Even for a city as apparently determined as Los Angeles, the investments and cultural change necessary to retrofit so much gray infrastructure are hard won.

We are expecting more mortality, more illness,\u201d said de Guzman. \u201cBut while we adapt we also have a recognition that there\u2019s an inherently optimistic way that we can go about the situation that we\u2019ve been handed.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/aug/20/death-blackouts-melting-asphalt-ways-the-climate-crisis-will-change-how-we-live\">Death, blackouts, melting asphalt: ways the climate crisis will change how we live</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Climate advocates here see their role as two-fold: an urgency to green a gray LA and save lives, and to inspire greater climate action at the same time.</p> \n<p>\u201cOf course, urban heat island isn\u2019t the same thing as climate change.

Last summer, city residents in endured some of its highest temperatures ever recorded. Worse is likely to come. LA\u2019s hot inland areas are projected to experience twice as many extreme heat days by mid-century; University of Maryland researchers project, on current emissions, that by 2080 the climate will be as hot as Baja California, Mexico, is now.

The roofs worked so well, why not tackle the roads next? Streets make up about 15% of the city\u2019s land, while parks comprise 13%. If heat-trapping, car-centric roads are one of LA\u2019s biggest climate problems, they\u2019re also a potential site of intervention. But the research on cool street cover leaves some open questions. According to a 2017 study, most cool pavement sealants were more resource-intensive than ordinary paving material. There\u2019s also concern that staining on white roads could counteract their benefits. Alternatively, if they stay fresh and bright, some fear they could actually reflect the hot sun back at unsuspecting residents. Still, Spotts is undeterred. \u201cThe street is made of the same stuff it\u2019s been made of since World War II,\u201d said Spotts. \u201cWe think it\u2019s time for cities and suppliers to experiment.\u201d Water Permeable pavement is a far more subtle addition to LA\u2019s climate resiliency schemes than cooling landcover. Unlike a gleaming white-coated street, the porous pavement and bioswales that catch and filter runoff don\u2019t look like anything special. The dry wells that capture that water for reuse blend entirely into the urban landscape. On a tour of water-capturing green infrastructure, Kevin Ho, an LA city sanitation engineer, pointed to two metal covers set into the road, several feet in front of a massive storm drain. \u201cWhen it rains, it\u2019s like opening up a fire hydrant and pointing it down into the dry well \u2013 it just collects it all,\u201d said Ho. \u201cIf possible, we would just put dry wells throughout the city.\u201d In a partnership between the City Department of Water and Power, the Bureau of Sanitation and California State Coastal Conservancy, these experimental projects have been distributed across a handful of major thoroughfares and small residential side streets, with the goal of increasing local water security and reducing local heat. The mayor\u2019s resilience plan calls for water infrastructure that \u201cwill ensure the city is prepared to handle both extreme wet and extreme dry years\u201d. Right now, LA county gets 41% of its water from local underground aquifers and recycling \u2013 the goal is 50% by 2025. Permeable pavement, bioswales and dry wells can make the city better adapted to arid periods, and make flood-prone neighborhoods more resilient to superstorms. The distributed stormwater capture project in the San Fernando Valley stands to collect enough water to serve around 1,200 families per year. It\u2019s a literal drop in the bucket, but the initiative is still in an early stage. \u201cThese projects are so spotty, and they\u2019re at all different levels of green,\u201d said Kara Kemmler, a coastal conservancy project manager. \u201cI would love to see some more trees,\u201d lamented Kemmler. \u201cSo you have that water capture, but create some shade, some carbon sequestration, some urban heat island mitigation while you have the opportunity. \u201d Shade Creamy asphalt sealant lowers the surface temperature of a road roughly 10F. But the shade from a mature, leafy tree can provide more like 40-50F (22-28C) of cooling power, on top of sequestering carbon. \u201cBy and large the literature is kind of mixed on which one is \u2018better\u2019 \u2013 I\u2019m a firm believer that we\u2019ve got to do both,\u201d said Edith de Guzman, executive director of the nonprofit Tree People. Trees seem to be the obvious adaptation fix to cool a city, recapture water runoff and increase local carbon capture. Earlier this month, the mayor\u2019s office appointed LA\u2019s first forest officer to oversee increasing the city\u2019s canopy by at least 50% by 2028 in areas that currently have the least shade. \u201cThere\u2019s all manner of state or other funding sources that will allow for tree planting to occur. But this is an asset that needs to be maintained,\u201d said de Guzman. Instead of unilaterally taking on the project of greening LA, Tree People trains those who want to green their own neighborhoods, thus creating a network of tree-passionate planters and waterers. But compared to pouring reflective or permeable concrete, or installing a cool roof, planted greenery by its nature conflicts with the gray environment. Planting comes second to vehicle sightlines in the sprawling car-centric metropolis. And over time, the shallow roots on many of LA\u2019s trees have torn up the pavement. The city recently settled a lawsuit that will require a $1.4bn investment in sidewalk, ramp and crosswalk repairs in order to make them disability-accessible. That settlement could provide an opportunity to green the city better by choosing more deep-rooted species. LA appears committed to a greener, shadier future \u2013 but the city has fallen short in past efforts to create cool cover. Trees have gone unplanted. Bus shelters have gone unbuilt. The city is losing transit riders to car travel, and climate crisis could only make it worse. A pilot at one large northwest valley transit station will create a variety of heat-beating infrastructure to make transit more attractive. \u201cIf you knew you\u2019d be completely in the shade, that there was water waiting for you at the train station, wouldn\u2019t that be an easier place for people to take transit?\u201d said Parfrey. The future Just as LA\u2019s critical warming is not evenly distributed, neither are its heat-relieving elements. You can see this green gap in aerial photos of the city: Wealthier neighborhoods are shielded by foliage, while poorer ones are exposed to the sun \u2013 sometimes by design, in order to provide clear sight lines for surveillance cameras. The gap in heat-beating infrastructure creates an inequitable distribution of health risk. While the city takes local wealth into account when determining where to install new heat-mitigating infrastructure, intracity inequality is not so easily paved over, from uninsulated buildings to higher proportional energy costs to longer waits at those unsheltered bus stops. \u201cIf you want to look at a single issue that separates the haves from the have-nots, it\u2019s heat,\u201d said Shickman. \u201cEvery negative effect of heat hits low income neighborhoods and people of color more.\u201d Even for a city as apparently determined as Los Angeles, the investments and cultural change necessary to retrofit so much gray infrastructure are hard won. These projects are all still in a nascent stage. But every square inch of green infrastructure contributes to better adapting it to a hotter future. \u201cWe\u2019re aware of the projections out there and the reality that we are in for a fairly scary trajectory for continued heating. We are expecting more mortality, more illness,\u201d said de Guzman. \u201cBut while we adapt we also have a recognition that there\u2019s an inherently optimistic way that we can go about the situation that we\u2019ve been handed.\u201d Climate advocates here see their role as two-fold: an urgency to green a gray LA and save lives, and to inspire greater climate action at the same time. \u201cOf course, urban heat island isn\u2019t the same thing as climate change. But there\u2019s something we can do in the interim, and we hope cooling down the city is a gateway to more activism and awareness,\u201d said Parfrey. \u201cBecause this is a marathon.\u201d Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter",

The most popular show is the US version of The Office, which ran for nine series on the US channel NBC in the 00s. Friends, the archetypal feelgood 90s sitcom (iffy sexual politics notwithstanding), is the second-most-streamed show on the platform \u2013<strong> </strong>this week, a former employee of Robert De Niro\u2019s production company <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/aug/19/robert-de-niro-sues-ex-employee-embezzlement-netflix-binge\" title=\"\">was alleged in its court claim to have</a> watched 55 episodes of it in one four-day period.

Ideally from the 90s, but maybe the 00s. And preferably something that we have seen many, many times before. Welcome to the age of non-event TV.</p> \n<p>\u201cOver the past month or so, I have been watching as much Modern Family as possible,\u201d says Ciaran, 29, who works as a policy analyst in London. \u201cI\u2019ve seen them all loads of times, but I just don\u2019t feel like watching anything else because I love the warmth and comfort that comes from the show. I think I started watching it again when I was going through a particularly bad time at work. I got addicted to the warmth, and then I got addicted to just feeling good about myself.\u201d</p> \n<p>Lucy, 28, from London, feels the same about Gilmore Girls. The kooky comedy-drama never drew sky-high ratings when it aired on US cable TV between 2000 and 2007, but it has become a huge hit in the streaming era. (Netflix did deign to reveal a couple of years ago that it was its \u201cmost <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/oct/18/which-netflix-shows-are-being-binged-the-fastest\" title=\"\">binge-raced</a>\u201d show \u2013 consumed in its entirety within 24 hours of appearing on the service.) \u201cI rewatch it when I\u2019m stressed as low-level distraction, but also to return to reassuring worlds with low jeopardy and known outcomes,\u201d says Lucy.</p> \n<p>Sometimes, she has it on in the background while she does housework or lets Netflix autoplay her to sleep. Lucy says she still likes to watch the prestige shows that everyone is talking about \u2013 but they\u2019re a bit like haute cuisine to Gilmore Girls\u2019 pasta. \u201cI find it more relaxing to rewatch, as I don\u2019t have to join in on the hot takes and social threads that surround the \u2018big new series\u2019 or worry about spoilers,\u201d she says. \u201cI can create a little bubble and totally tune out.\u201d</p> \n<p>It has often been observed that the emergence of Netflix, Amazon Prime, Now TV, Hulu, Facebook TV and the rest has opened up frontiers for TV \u2013 makers don\u2019t have to worry so much about averting flagging ratings when viewers start losing interest. Now that we can consume series at our own pace, our tolerance for convoluted narrative arcs, enormous casts and season-long digressions has increased hugely. There\u2019s lots of Silicon Valley cash to bankroll the programmes, too. But while dinner party chat still centres on Russian Doll and Big Little Lies, platforms are increasingly thinking about the other stuff: the chewing-gum TV, the long-tail TV, the shows that vaguely brighten up the room. That could be a random episode of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air that turns into a weekend-long binge, or it may be mid-00s cookery flotsam, middlebrow property porn or makeover TV detritus.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"50872b03066ff3cea59b544734277ff5d7365c36\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/50872b03066ff3cea59b544734277ff5d7365c36/0_43_3000_1799/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Just one more \u2026 The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Just one more \u2026 The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NBC via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Matthew Ball, a US venture capitalist and sharp commentator on the streaming platforms, calls it \u201ctonnage\u201d.

      "bodyText": "In the opening episode of Netflix\u2019s animated Hollywood satire BoJack Horseman, the eponymous steed gives a drunken speech about Horsin\u2019 Around, the (fictional) feelgood sitcom that made him a star in the 90s. \u201cFor a lot of people, life is just one long, hard kick in the urethra,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd sometimes, when you get home from a long day of getting kicked in the urethra, you just want to watch a show about good, likable people who love each other \u2013 where no matter what happens, at the end of 30 minutes, everything\u2019s gonna turn out OK.\u201d BoJack Horseman is a rare thing on Netflix in that it is a) original, b) critically adored and c) extremely popular. It is the 15th-most-viewed Netflix show in the US, according to the analytics firm Jumpshot (one of the best guides to what is popular on the platform, as Netflix doesn\u2019t release stats). But cast your eyes up that list and there are far more Horsin\u2019 Arounds than there are BoJack Horsemans. The most popular show is the US version of The Office, which ran for nine series on the US channel NBC in the 00s. Friends, the archetypal feelgood 90s sitcom (iffy sexual politics notwithstanding), is the second-most-streamed show on the platform \u2013 this week, a former employee of Robert De Niro\u2019s production company was alleged in its court claim to have watched 55 episodes of it in one four-day period. No wonder Netflix is believed to have paid WarnerMedia $100m ($85m) to license the show for 2019. Gilmore Girls, Parks and Recreation, Arrested Development and Frasier also appear high on the list, more prominent than heralded Netflix Originals, such as Stranger Things, House of Cards or The Crown (reportedly the most expensive TV show ever made). It seems that, in this time of unprecedented choice and quality, the so-called golden age of prestige television, most of us still want to watch half-hour shows about vaguely likable people in which everything turns out OK. Ideally from the 90s, but maybe the 00s. And preferably something that we have seen many, many times before. Welcome to the age of non-event TV. \u201cOver the past month or so, I have been watching as much Modern Family as possible,\u201d says Ciaran, 29, who works as a policy analyst in London. \u201cI\u2019ve seen them all loads of times, but I just don\u2019t feel like watching anything else because I love the warmth and comfort that comes from the show. I think I started watching it again when I was going through a particularly bad time at work. I got addicted to the warmth, and then I got addicted to just feeling good about myself.\u201d Lucy, 28, from London, feels the same about Gilmore Girls. The kooky comedy-drama never drew sky-high ratings when it aired on US cable TV between 2000 and 2007, but it has become a huge hit in the streaming era. (Netflix did deign to reveal a couple of years ago that it was its \u201cmost binge-raced\u201d show \u2013 consumed in its entirety within 24 hours of appearing on the service.) \u201cI rewatch it when I\u2019m stressed as low-level distraction, but also to return to reassuring worlds with low jeopardy and known outcomes,\u201d says Lucy. Sometimes, she has it on in the background while she does housework or lets Netflix autoplay her to sleep. Lucy says she still likes to watch the prestige shows that everyone is talking about \u2013 but they\u2019re a bit like haute cuisine to Gilmore Girls\u2019 pasta. \u201cI find it more relaxing to rewatch, as I don\u2019t have to join in on the hot takes and social threads that surround the \u2018big new series\u2019 or worry about spoilers,\u201d she says. \u201cI can create a little bubble and totally tune out.\u201d It has often been observed that the emergence of Netflix, Amazon Prime, Now TV, Hulu, Facebook TV and the rest has opened up frontiers for TV \u2013 makers don\u2019t have to worry so much about averting flagging ratings when viewers start losing interest. Now that we can consume series at our own pace, our tolerance for convoluted narrative arcs, enormous casts and season-long digressions has increased hugely. There\u2019s lots of Silicon Valley cash to bankroll the programmes, too. But while dinner party chat still centres on Russian Doll and Big Little Lies, platforms are increasingly thinking about the other stuff: the chewing-gum TV, the long-tail TV, the shows that vaguely brighten up the room. That could be a random episode of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air that turns into a weekend-long binge, or it may be mid-00s cookery flotsam, middlebrow property porn or makeover TV detritus. Matthew Ball, a US venture capitalist and sharp commentator on the streaming platforms, calls it \u201ctonnage\u201d. For him, the idea that it is \u201cquality\u201d driving the shift to streaming is a misconception. \u201cNetflix\u2019s biggest shows drove subscriber growth and branding, but most of its success comes from enabling audiences to easily watch large volumes of all types of content wherever they are, without fail, and at a low cost,\u201d he says. \u201cNetflix isn\u2019t \u2018hired\u2019 for Stranger Things, but for entertainment at large.\u201d Tonnage is increasingly where the platforms are focusing their algorithms and cash as the attention wars escalate. Netflix is likely to lose Friends and the US version of The Office \u2013 a combined 400-plus episodes of non-event TV \u2013 as WarnerMedia and NBC, their owners, launch their own streaming platforms at some point in the next couple of years. Apple is due to launch a streaming service in the autumn, and has lobbed a reported $6bn at new programmes (including a drama starring Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston as warring TV hosts). But, although audiences come for the shiny new stuff, they stay for the old reliables such as Seinfeld, over which there is a bidding war. Disney+ is launching in the autumn \u2013 and because Disney owns the Pixar, Star Wars and Marvel franchises, that is a lot of \u201ctonnage\u201d. Ball reckons Netflix would have achieved similar levels of success with or without Friends \u2013 but he stresses that Netflix is popular for precisely the same reasons that Friends is popular. It\u2019s just easy to watch. \u201cNetflix\u2019s delivery innovations have made it so easy to discover and watch content that whole generations, who would never have watched Friends or Golden Girls via occasional reruns on random TV networks, are devouring them.\u201d There is something novel about watching a season of Friends in sequential order, as opposed to a mishmash of repeats and missed episodes. A semi-forgotten series such as Frasier, meanwhile, can find new life in the streaming era as a meme trove. All this presents an additional challenge to the traditional channels, as the new Ofcom statistics reveal. The average British person watches nearly five hours of video a day, on TVs, laptops, phones and the rest. Live TV remains dominant \u2013 on average, we watch two hours and 43 minutes a day \u2013 but other means are catching up, including recorded playback (30 minutes), streaming services (26 minutes) and YouTube not on a TV (34 minutes). We may no longer be content to settle for random reruns on regular channels, but according to the Broadcasters\u2019 Audience Research Board (Barb) \u2013 which has collated viewing-hours data since 1992 \u2013 it\u2019s not vastly more than we used to watch.

Prior to that, I checked emails, read the news and browsed social media in bed. My phone is usually within arm\u2019s reach, which seems to me fairly typical of everyone, old and young, who includes a phone in their essential trifecta of belongings, alongside their keys and wallet. I spend an average of two hours and 20 minutes a day on my phone, according to my iPhone\u2019s Screen Time function. As someone who writes about internet ephemera for a living, I feel justified in my habit of filter-feeding through social media like a megamouth shark.

As well as documenting the massive cultural changes that took place, he draws a clear line between the decline of industrialisation, the miners\u2019 strike, sound-system culture and the rise of dance music. As Deller shows old footage of whey-faced ravers in bucket hats and sports gear dancing in fields and warehouses, the students look on with a blend of bafflement and fascination. It\u2019s weird, one of them says, that no one has a phone.</p> <p>Another film, also out now, reports on a youth movement born from political and social disenfranchisement, and a desire for a new way of living. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/25/we-knew-we-had-something-extraordinary-looking-back-on-woodstock-50-years-on\" title=\"\">Woodstock \u2013 Three Days that Defined a Generation</a> tells the well-documented story of the hippy era and the 1969 music festival that took place in the shadow of Vietnam and civil rights unrest. \u201cWe were looking for answers,\u201d says one attendee. \u201cWe were looking for other people that felt the same way as we did \u2026 If 400,000 people could get together and have absolutely no violence, absolutely no conflict, I felt like we could bring all of that love back into society \u2013 and change the world.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ca9facd8cf6e87efbce8ac7898d2e1bc1124b003\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca9facd8cf6e87efbce8ac7898d2e1bc1124b003/218_116_1160_696/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ravers hit new heights in Jeremy Deller\u2019s Everybody in the Place.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ravers hit new heights in Jeremy Deller\u2019s Everybody in the Place.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 Jeremy Deller</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The similarities between the two eras go well beyond the urge to get off your face in a field. In both films we hear of politicians attempting to legislate against large gatherings; of social and generational schisms; and of young people finding common purpose via music and like-minded communities. We see this in a different guise today: our youth may not have found kinship through a specific musical movement but they have nonetheless gathered together for a higher cause. Their attempts to tackle climate catastrophe through online campaigning and protest movements such as Extinction Rebellion, to shake world leaders out of their torpor, would seem more urgent than the hedonistic cultural revolutions of yesteryear. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/19/greta-thunberg-attackers-climate-crisis-activist\" title=\"\">But still their elders sneer</a>.</p> <p>It has become a sport among commentators of a certain age and political persuasion to goad and humiliate young activists for their idealism and integrity. Last week brought the unedifying spectacle of the radio presenter and professional troll Julia Hartley-Brewer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JuliaHB1/status/1161707706790621184\" title=\"\">crowing on social media</a> about booking a long-haul winter holiday above a picture of 16-year-old climate-crisis activist Greta Thunberg \u2013 who is currently travelling by a zero-emissions yacht to attend UN climate summits in New York \u2013 and noting: \u201cLevel of guilt being felt: 0%.\u201d Fellow garbage-spewers Brendan O\u2019Neill, Rod Liddle and Toby Young have variously mocked Thunberg for her appearance, her supposed ignorance of environmental policy and \u2013 based on the fact that Thunberg\u2019s mum performed on Eurovision \u2013 her privilege. (That latter gem was highlighted by Young, the son of a baron who famously phoned up Oxford University to secure a place for his low-achieving lad.) It\u2019s always interesting to hear these voices decrying Britain\u2019s lack of identity and community, and using it as an explanation for the Brexit vote, while overlooking the cultural movements trying to make life better through collective action.</p> <p>Youth movements don\u2019t come about in a vacuum, though that doesn\u2019t stop the older generation from clutching their pearls when the young reject their thinking and values.

      "bodyText": "In the documentary Everybody in the Place, the Turner prize-winning artist Jeremy Deller delivers a talk to a group of sixth-form politics students about late-80s acid house in Britain. As well as documenting the massive cultural changes that took place, he draws a clear line between the decline of industrialisation, the miners\u2019 strike, sound-system culture and the rise of dance music. As Deller shows old footage of whey-faced ravers in bucket hats and sports gear dancing in fields and warehouses, the students look on with a blend of bafflement and fascination. It\u2019s weird, one of them says, that no one has a phone. Another film, also out now, reports on a youth movement born from political and social disenfranchisement, and a desire for a new way of living. Woodstock \u2013 Three Days that Defined a Generation tells the well-documented story of the hippy era and the 1969 music festival that took place in the shadow of Vietnam and civil rights unrest. \u201cWe were looking for answers,\u201d says one attendee. \u201cWe were looking for other people that felt the same way as we did \u2026 If 400,000 people could get together and have absolutely no violence, absolutely no conflict, I felt like we could bring all of that love back into society \u2013 and change the world.\u201d The similarities between the two eras go well beyond the urge to get off your face in a field. In both films we hear of politicians attempting to legislate against large gatherings; of social and generational schisms; and of young people finding common purpose via music and like-minded communities. We see this in a different guise today: our youth may not have found kinship through a specific musical movement but they have nonetheless gathered together for a higher cause. Their attempts to tackle climate catastrophe through online campaigning and protest movements such as Extinction Rebellion, to shake world leaders out of their torpor, would seem more urgent than the hedonistic cultural revolutions of yesteryear. But still their elders sneer. It has become a sport among commentators of a certain age and political persuasion to goad and humiliate young activists for their idealism and integrity. Last week brought the unedifying spectacle of the radio presenter and professional troll Julia Hartley-Brewer crowing on social media about booking a long-haul winter holiday above a picture of 16-year-old climate-crisis activist Greta Thunberg \u2013 who is currently travelling by a zero-emissions yacht to attend UN climate summits in New York \u2013 and noting: \u201cLevel of guilt being felt: 0%.\u201d Fellow garbage-spewers Brendan O\u2019Neill, Rod Liddle and Toby Young have variously mocked Thunberg for her appearance, her supposed ignorance of environmental policy and \u2013 based on the fact that Thunberg\u2019s mum performed on Eurovision \u2013 her privilege. (That latter gem was highlighted by Young, the son of a baron who famously phoned up Oxford University to secure a place for his low-achieving lad.) It\u2019s always interesting to hear these voices decrying Britain\u2019s lack of identity and community, and using it as an explanation for the Brexit vote, while overlooking the cultural movements trying to make life better through collective action. Youth movements don\u2019t come about in a vacuum, though that doesn\u2019t stop the older generation from clutching their pearls when the young reject their thinking and values. We have seen it repeatedly, from the birth of rock\u2019n\u2019roll, to the hippy, punk and rave eras. Youthful rebellion isn\u2019t always about sticking two fingers up at parental authority. It can be about artistic innovation, political alienation and recognition of the need for social change. It can be young people looking at the world handed to them and reacting not with gratitude but alarm. Yet, as Deller makes clear, similarly woven into our culture is a distrust of the younger generation. Midlife moral panic is as much a rite of passage as dyeing your hair blue in your teens.

      "bodyText": "There have been few fashion statements over the years at G7 summits (dress code: world leader suit, sensible shoes). But this year, G7 leaders will be joined by more than 20 fashion retailers and brands, including the owner of Gucci, Kering, H&amp;M and Zara\u2019s parent company, Inditex, for a key fashion moment \u2013 a global pact to fight the climate crisis and protect biodiversity and the oceans. The deal to be concluded in Biarritz at the weekend comes as the global fashion industry faces an unprecedented backlash from young people concerned that it is contributing more to climate change than the aeronautical and shipping industries combined. Without action, the industry could account for a quarter of the world\u2019s carbon budget by 2050. The issue is soaring up the agenda, with models on the catwalk at London fashion week next month set on a collision course with campaigners from Extinction Rebellion who want the event scrapped in the face of the climate emergency. Growing numbers of young people are turning away from fast fashion towards reuse and resale sites such as Depop in the UK, Thredup and The RealReal in the US and YCloset in China. The secondhand market is expected to overtake fast fashion in the next few years and be 50% bigger than it by 2028, according to a report by market analysts GlobalData for Thredup. The surge in environmental concern is forcing brands to accelerate sustainability plans and club together to bring about change not only in stores but with the factories and suppliers they share around the world. Last month Inditex, the world\u2019s third-largest apparel company, announced that all of its collections would be made from 100% sustainable fabrics before 2025, the first international high street store to make such a commitment. It is switching to renewable energy and pledging to send zero waste to landfill by 2025. The UK parliament\u2019s environmental audit committee investigation into sustainable fashion has also prompted action, despite the government rejecting a recommendation of a 1p per garment tax to fund better textile recycling schemes. The committee\u2019s report published in February named and shamed brands such as Boohoo, JD Sports, Sports Direct and TK Maxx, which had been slow to take action: failing to use sustainable cotton, collect used clothing or sign up to the government-backed sustainable clothing action plan (Scap). Scap, whose nine large retail signatories including Next, M&amp;S, Primark and Asos have committed to reducing their water use, carbon footprint and waste sent to landfill by 15% by 2020, said it had seen a notable increase in inquiries about joining up. With the spotlight shining on the fashion industry, Primark, one of the flag-bearers for the kind of one-use fast fashion so heavily criticised by environmental activists, is experimenting with clothing recycling bins at its new store in Birmingham and has pledged to introduce a full scheme this year. It has also launched sustainable cotton jeans and eco-friendly glitter. Giorgina Waltier, sustainability manager for H&amp;M in the UK and Ireland, said: \u201cThere has definitely been a significant change in people\u2019s attitudes towards sustainability and fashion in the last 12 to 18 months, with a real sense of urgency around these issues and a definite demand from consumers for more action and greater transparency from brands.\u201d H&amp;M, the Swedish group that also owns the Cos, &amp; Other Stories, Monki and Weekday brands, is aiming to have 100% recycled or sustainably sourced materials by 2030, up from 57% now.

Marie-Claire Daveu, chief sustainability officer at Kering (whose boss Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault, was asked by French president, Emmanuel Macron to help pull together the G7 fashion-industry deal) said the international fashion pact would enable global retailers to share best practice and ideas and combine their buying power to push for change right back to the agricultural practices involved in supplying raw materials. \u201cMany companies have taken the initiative but if they do things on their own it has less impact on the ground than if they work together,\u201d said Daveu.

Chief executives and designers are also citizens of the world and very conscious that they have an important role to play in one of the most important issues of our century.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not an option, it\u2019s now a duty of running a global company.\u201d But there are fears that the G7 pact will only add complexity and confusion: there are already many groups involved in sustainability, including the Sustainable Apparel Coalition, Global Fashion Agenda and Common Objective, a private enterprise that recently took over the former Ethical Fashion Forum, which was run as a charity. Several retail and sustainable fashion experts told the Guardian they were concerned that the array of standards and global groups which brands and their suppliers were now expected to sign up to could divert resources from actual action. \u201cIt\u2019s great what Macron is doing,\u201d said one big retailer who has held back from signing up to the G7 pact, referring to the fact that it was the French president, Emmanuel Macron, who asked Kering\u2019s boss, Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault, to help pull together the G7 fashion industry deal. \u201cBut our responsibility is not to just sign something and the job is done. It is fine to say stuff but actually doing stuff is what\u2019s important. Resources can be consumed by meetings. Let\u2019s keep the balance on delivering.\u201d David Moon, of Scap,said global initiatives served to get big company bosses focused on environmental issues but he said \u201cnational action like Scap can really drive change. We can [muster] capital investment and ensure people are measuring and managing change.\u201d The UK government has backed an extension to Scap when it winds up next year and the new deal is expected to involve more retailers and to take steps towards developing industry-wide systems to recycle and reuse textiles and fibres. Most big retailers now agree they have to adapt to survive. Waltier said: \u201cOur planet doesn\u2019t have the resources available to facilitate the linear production model that the vast majority of the fashion industry operates and therefore systemic change is the only option.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

      "bodyText": "When the Judith Neilson Institute for Journalism pledged money to News Corp and Nine Entertainment last month, some cynics wondered why the $100m philanthropic outfit was giving a leg-up to media moguls. The director of the Judith Neilson Institute for Journalism and Ideas, Mark Ryan, says the readers of the Australian and the Australian Financial Review, both grant recipients, deserve quality journalism. Whether grant recipients are newspapers owned by Rupert Murdoch or an independent publisher is irrelevant to the institute, Ryan says. The Judith Neilson Institute for Journalism and Ideas was founded by the billionaire Australian philanthropist last year to support public interest journalism. Guardian Australia was among several outlets, including the ABC and the Sydney Morning Herald, to receive a grant. \u201cI\u2019ve been pretty upfront about this,\u201d Ryan tells Guardian Australia. \u201cFor this institute to succeed, and to succeed globally, it needs to be working with everybody, including large commercial players. \u201cWe were not going to be favouring what is perceived as one side or other of Australian media. \u201cWe need to fish where the fish are and work with existing and very strong platforms. We\u2019ll be doing other smaller and what people may think of as more deserving recipients as well. We want to partner up with anyone. We don\u2019t want to close the door on anybody.\u201d One of the recipients of the first round of grants is not a publication at all but the Sydney Opera House, which sources say received the largest amount of non-government funding for a festival in its history. On 1 September, the institute is partnering with the Sydney Opera House on Antidote, its annual festival of ideas curated by Edwina Throsby. As a consequence of the unusual collaboration, the festival will include panels on reporting on climate crisis, press freedom and free speech. Renowned Philippines investigative journalist Maria Ressa is heading up the panel on press freedom \u2013 My Crime is Journalism. The Rappler editor has been reporting critically on the extrajudicial killings, human rights violations and fast-rising death toll from president Rodrigo Duterte\u2019s brutal war on drugs. The session with Ressa, Egyptian journalist Lina Attalah, Russian journalist Irina Borogan and the dean of the Columbia University graduate school of journalism Steve Coll will be moderated by Australian journalist Peter Greste, who was sentenced to seven years\u2019 prison by Egyptian authorities in 2014 before being deported. Meanwhile, CEO of the Dart Centre for Journalism and Trauma Bruce Shapiro, Sisonke Msimang and Atallah will chat with Sky News host David Speers about communication in a polarised world in a session titled Who Gets to Speak. The Covering Climate panel will be moderated by Kerry O\u2019Brien and feature Columbia Journalism Review editor and Climate Now co-founder Kyle Pope, the conservationist Tim Flannery and the CNN Indonesia anchor Desi Anwar. Pope is leading the Covering Climate Now initiative, which has partnered with the Guardian, and is trying to shake up the world\u2019s media to cover the climate crisis as the most pressing story of our time. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to get outlets to understand that we are not saying you have to hire a climate reporter,\u201d Pope explains. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to get people to slightly recalibrate how everyone thinks about it. Every beat reporter, including sports and business, should start to think about the changes to the climate and how they should be covered. \u201cWe\u2019re fighting perceptions that it\u2019s depressing, it\u2019s complex and it\u2019s boring. It\u2019s about the survival of humanity, so it\u2019s definitely not boring!\u201d Pope says it\u2019s not ideology which is the greatest barrier to widespread reporting of the climate crisis, but limited resources. \u201cI don\u2019t think the greatest challenge is the Murdoch press, and I don\u2019t expect Fox to sign on [to the initiative]. But we have a much bigger media in the US, and you have a trifecta of companies that control the market there [in Australia]. \u201cIt\u2019s not so much that that\u2019s the problem. There\u2019s been a severe reduction in news resources at almost every organisation and I think they all say, \u2018Oh god you\u2019re going to ask us to do more? We have to do more?\u2019 \u201cThey think that they have to cover city hall or climate change. It\u2019s not what we\u2019re saying. You cover city hall and climate issues with the same person.\u201d \u2022 Antidote festival is on Sunday 1 September at the Sydney Opera House \u2022 On 22 August 2019 the standfirst on this article was changed to clarify that the grant given to Sydney Opera House was the largest granted for a festival.",

      "bodyText": "The garbage company Cleanaway has taken effective control of most of the Victorian recycling group SKM and says it wants to stem the state\u2019s rubbish crisis. Cleanaway said it had paid about $60m to the Commonwealth Bank to buy out the bank\u2019s position as SKM\u2019s major lender and had appointed Mark Korda and Bryan Webster as receivers to run the business. Its position as secured creditor puts Cleanaway in the box seat to buy most of SKM if the receivers decide to put it up for sale. The receivership covers all of SKM\u2019s business except glass recycling, which separately owes Westpac about $5m. SKM, which has been derided by the state government as \u201ccowboys\u201d, has been in crisis since the start of the year after a series of fires at its recycling stockpiles prompted the Victorian Environment Protection Agency to restrict its ability to take in new rubbish. It was also hit by a crackdown from Chinese authorities on importing waste from Australia \u2013 part of a general move across Asia to stop accepting other people\u2019s garbage. The crisis reached a new high three weeks ago when SKM stopped taking recycling from more than 30 councils, resulting in more than 180,000 tonnes a year potentially being sent to the tip. Korda said debts owed by SKM totalled about $100m. He said the receivers \u201cwill be aiming to get the business back to capacity to help ease Victoria\u2019s waste crisis\u201d. \u201cThis must be done within our statutory obligations to get the best value from the business while repaying the secured creditor,\u201d Korda said. \u201cWe will also begin working immediately with the Victorian government and regulators to prepare for a path forward.\u201d The receivers said they would put SKM\u2019s operations on pause while assessing the business, including the stockpiles of recycling that have banked up at sites around Melbourne. They then plan to come up with a \u201crescue and restructure package\u201d and may put it on the market. It is not clear how much SKM owed the CBA, although some market sources indicated Cleanaway paid close to 100c in the dollar to take over the bank\u2019s position. Cleanaway\u2019s managing director, Vik Bansal, said the company was interested in buying all or part of SKM\u2019s assets from the receivers. \u201cIf a sale process is undertaken and, if we are successful in purchasing any assets, we will return the assets to a sustainable footing,\u201d Bansal said.

      "bodyText": "Angela Merkel is likely to give a friendly but firm rebuttal to Boris Johnson during his first overseas visit as prime minister on Wednesday, with politicians and officials in Berlin saying they do not consider that his letter to Donald Tusk asking the EU to drop the Irish backstop contains constructive proposals for further negotiations. \u201cThe letter to the president of the European council is not a serious offer, and Boris Johnson knows it,\u201d said Norbert R\u00f6ttgen, an ally of the chancellor who heads the German parliament\u2019s foreign affairs committee. In a four-page letter published on Monday night, Johnson called on the EU to scrap the backstop, calling the last-resort solution for a seamless border on the island of Ireland anti-democratic and \u201cinconsistent with the sovereignty of the UK as a state\u201d. The British prime minister\u2019s first official proposal to the EU since taking office last month has been met with responses ranging from indifference to incredulity in the German capital, with senior officials saying it showed Westminster\u2019s debate on the withdrawal agreement to be stuck on the same arguments of the so-called Brady amendment, which the EU rejected in January. \u201cThe British prime minister starts his letter by saying he is personally committed to finding an agreement, but there is no sign in the rest of the letter that this is actually the case,\u201d said R\u00f6ttgen, a delegate for the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU). \u201cTo suggest the backstop could weaken the Good Friday agreement \u2013 that\u2019s strong stuff. \u201cIf Johnson really wanted to achieve something on his visits to Paris and Berlin, he would have been well advised against writing this letter.\u201d Johnson will receive military honours outside Angela Merkel\u2019s chancellory at 6pm CET on Wednesday, followed by a meeting in which the two leaders will discuss bilateral and European policy issues. \u201cMerkel is politically and emotionally well inclined towards the British, and her willingness to maintain friendly relations between the two countries will be on display on Wednesday,\u201d said R\u00f6ttgen. \u201cBut the extent to which the Johnson government is prepared to humiliate itself for a trade deal with the USA has not gone unnoticed in Berlin.\u201d A failure to reach an agreement over the terms of Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union would lead to the UK crashing out of the bloc on 31 October. On the surface, Merkel\u2019s government has been projecting a confidence that it is in a better position to cope with a chaotic no-deal scenario than the United Kingdom. \u201cAn exit without a deal would be in no one\u2019s interest,\u201d a spokesperson for the chancellor said on Monday. \u201cBut we are prepared for all eventualities that a disorderly Brexit would bring.\u201d The German government has passed more than 50 laws and transitional arrangements for the eventuality of a no-deal Brexit at the end of October, and some concerns, over the UK-reliant process for licensing blood reserves for example, have been alleviated since the original exit date in March. Legislation has been prepared to ensure British people and their family members living in Germany will receive residence permits if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, irrespective of the Home Office\u2019s latest plans for EU citizens in the UK. Behind the scenes, however, there are concerns that the potential crises emerging from a hard Brexit are too complex to be adequately prepared for, and that Germany\u2019s export-focused economy could be fatally hit at a time when it is already being squeezed by a trade war between China and the US. Even before Brexit has happened, German exports to Britain are down 4% year on year, according to Commerzbank\u2019s figures, making it no longer the country\u2019s third-biggest export market but the fifth. Yet the current consensus in Berlin is that the time to address such economic concerns in negotiations with Britain has already passed. \u201cI don\u2019t see any sign of Germany having changed its position on the backstop since Johnson has come to power,\u201d said Nicolai von Ondarza, a political scientist at Berlin\u2019s SWP thinktank. \u201cThe official line remains the unofficial line. \u201cWhat has changed is the credibility of a no-deal Brexit.

Puebla\u2019s state governor, Miguel Barbosa, was part of the convoy, on a rare visit to condemn the lynchings but also to comprehend what he calls an inevitable response to \u201cinstitutional abandonment\u201d. Dozens of heavily-armed security forces were also deployed in the town. \u201cWe view what happened \u2026 as the reaction of a people who are fed up,\u201d the governor, an ally of Mexico\u2019s leftist president Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, told an emergency \u201crule of law\u201d assembly, to loud applause. \u201cTaking justice into our own hands is a way of responding [to crime],\u201d Barbosa said. \u201cBut it is not legal and you must understand and accept this. Such events \u2026 must not repeat themselves in any part of Puebla. That is why we need a public security system that is efficient and effective and \u2026 protects you.\u201d Once the governor had departed, without visiting the site of the killings, officials downplayed their significance, claiming the vigilantes had hailed from neighbouring towns. \u201cTepexco is a tranquil, peaceful place,\u201d insisted Porfirio Valent\u00edn Luna, the government secretary for the area. Valent\u00edn regretted that children had seen their playground turned into public gallows. \u201cUnfortunately, the kids saw these lamentable events,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was unavoidable.\u201d But many residents were unrepentant. \u201cPeople have had enough and this is the only way they have to defend themselves,\u201d one local businessman, who asked not to be named, declared, calling the lynching not \u201cone person\u2019s decision, but the decision of all the people\u201d. The man grew agitated as he described the abandonment he claimed justified the executions. \u201cIf someone comes along and wants to kill your family, you will defend them \u2013 tooth and nail, by any means necessary \u2013 and you won\u2019t think twice. The people here are the same. We are people of peace,\u201d he insisted. \u201cBut if these people come back, we will do the same again.\u201d",

The resource company, McArthur River Mine (MRM), has sought to extend its mining operation until 2048, which will add on a further 1,000 years of rehabilitation and monitoring. The mine, 1,000km from Darwin, has a potted history, with multiple allegations and instances of contamination of surrounding environment and mismanagement of toxic waste. In December 2017, Guardian Australia revealed the company had accidentally dumped 63 truckloads of toxic waste near the river the previous year. The incident and the government\u2019s investigation \u2013 which produced no report \u2013 were kept out of the public eye. Guardian Australia has sought further information about the investigation through freedom of information laws, but almost two years later later is yet to receive any documents, for reasons that include objections from MRM. In 2013, the suburb-sized waste rock pile combusted, and the resulting fire burned for more than a year, sending toxic smoke into the atmosphere.

He said the river quality should be tested against a benchmark of being a pristine environment, not \u201cas an already impacted river\u201d. The chief executive of the Northern Land Council, Marion Scrymgour, said the approval was the latest example of traditional owners and Aboriginal people who lived in and around Borroloola being ignored. \u201cAboriginal people in the mine area have consistently been denied involvement in decision making related to the mine, and have not seen the economic benefits that a native title mining agreement would justly bestow,\u201d she said.

Mudd said there were at least six critical areas of importance that required specific expertise on the panel for it to be properly monitored. \u201cThe underlying subtext is it\u2019s a problematic site with underlying issues and we need a good panel of experts to independently review everything.\u201d He said Glencore and the NT government would do well to have community-nominated experts on the panel, in part as recognition of their loss of social licence for the mine over previous years. The NT government\u2019s decision puts pressure on the Aboriginal Areas Protection Authority, the only remaining procedural roadblock for MRM. The AAPA has not yet granted a certificate to MRM allowing it to almost double the height of its waste rock pile. The height is currently restricted to go no higher than 80m \u2013 the height of nearby Mount Stubbs, a Barramundi Dreaming site for local clans. MRM has said it has an agreement with traditional custodians to increase the height but its validity has been disputed by some traditional owners and local people. Accidentally published government briefings in 2017 also cast doubt on it. The NLC\u2019s Scrymgour said the NT government\u2019s decision was \u201cpremature\u201d. \u201cMinister Kirby knows that an Aboriginal Areas Protection Authority certificate has not been obtained for the expansion of the Northern Overburden Encapsulation Facility and yet he has approved it anyhow,\u201d she said.",

The three-judge court of appeal dismissed Pell\u2019s first grounds for appeal \u2013 that the jury acted unreasonably in finding him guilty \u2013 by a margin of two to one. The other two grounds of appeal were dismissed unanimously. He will remain in jail until at least October 2022.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cThroughout his evidence, the complainant came across as someone who was telling the truth,\u201d Ferguson said. \u201cHe did not seek to embellish his evidence or tailor it in a manner favourable to the prosecution. As might have been expected, there were some things he could remember and many things which he could not. And his explanations of why that was so had a ring of truth.\u201d</p> \n<p>The truth was that Pell sexually assaulted two choirboys in the priest\u2019s sacristy after Sunday solemn mass at St Patrick\u2019s Cathedral in Melbourne in 1996. Pell orally raped one of the boys during this incident and indecently assaulted both of them. Pell offended a second time against one of the boys one month later, when he grabbed the boy\u2019s genitals in a church corridor, once more after Sunday solemn mass. He was convicted by jurors on four counts of an indecent act with a child under the age of 16 and one count of sexual penetration with a child under the age of 16. By the time the complainant spoke to police in June 2015, the other victim had died from an accidental heroin overdose at the age of 30. His father shed tears as the appeal was dismissed.</p> \n<p>Ferguson read a summary of her reasons, before the full reasons \u2013 spanning 300 pages \u2013 were released to journalists. But after reviewing some 30 hours of testimony from the trial, reviewing 2,000 pages of transcript, and examining the robes Pell wore while he was archbishop of Melbourne, Maxwell and Ferguson found it was fair that jurors had concluded they believed the complainant. In his dissenting judgment, Weinberg concluded that the complainant\u2019s evidence contained discrepancies.

      "bodyText": "Cardinal George Pell cut a dishevelled figure as he stepped into Melbourne\u2019s supreme court and took his seat in the dock, flanked by two police officers. His hair had grown long, a large bald patch showing through, and he wore all black, a pop of white showing from his clerical collar. Prison has taken its toll. He had hoped to walk free from the building on Wednesday morning. Three appellant judges swiftly shattered that hope as their decision was delivered as to whether 12 jurors were unreasonable in convicting him for sexually abusing two 13-year-old choirboys in 1996 when he was the archbishop of Melbourne. Within seconds of the chief justice, Anne Ferguson, the president of the court of appeal, justice Chris Maxwell, and justice Mark Weinberg taking their seats at 9.30am, Pell knew his fate. \u201cBy majority two-to-one, the court of appeal has dismissed Cardinal George Pell\u2019s appeal against his conviction for the commission of sexual offences,\u201d Ferguson said. \u201cHe will continue to serve his sentence of six years\u2019 imprisonment.\u201d Pell momentarily bowed his head but his face gave little away. The only sound in the court was of journalists typing as Ferguson read a summary of the court\u2019s reasons. Filling the court were supporters of Pell, as well as survivors of child sexual abuse and their advocates. Survivors gripped each other\u2019s hands as Ferguson continued, saying that she and Maxwell \u201caccepted the prosecution\u2019s submission that the complainant was a very compelling witness, was clearly not a liar, was not a fantasist and was a witness of the truth\u201d. \u201cThroughout his evidence, the complainant came across as someone who was telling the truth,\u201d Ferguson said. \u201cHe did not seek to embellish his evidence or tailor it in a manner favourable to the prosecution. As might have been expected, there were some things he could remember and many things which he could not. And his explanations of why that was so had a ring of truth.\u201d The truth was that Pell sexually assaulted two choirboys in the priest\u2019s sacristy after Sunday solemn mass at St Patrick\u2019s Cathedral in Melbourne in 1996. Pell orally raped one of the boys during this incident and indecently assaulted both of them. Pell offended a second time against one of the boys one month later, when he grabbed the boy\u2019s genitals in a church corridor, once more after Sunday solemn mass. He was convicted by jurors on four counts of an indecent act with a child under the age of 16 and one count of sexual penetration with a child under the age of 16. By the time the complainant spoke to police in June 2015, the other victim had died from an accidental heroin overdose at the age of 30. His father shed tears as the appeal was dismissed. Ferguson read a summary of her reasons, before the full reasons \u2013 spanning 300 pages \u2013 were released to journalists. But after reviewing some 30 hours of testimony from the trial, reviewing 2,000 pages of transcript, and examining the robes Pell wore while he was archbishop of Melbourne, Maxwell and Ferguson found it was fair that jurors had concluded they believed the complainant. In his dissenting judgment, Weinberg concluded that the complainant\u2019s evidence contained discrepancies. But in an appeal, only two of the three judges need to agree. \u201cHallelujah \u2013 proof there is a God,\u201d a victim advocate yelled outside of the court once Pell had been escorted from the building. Survivors of abuse expressed shock that the victim had received justice because they had seen so many cases before where victims had not been believed, or whose cases had never made it to court. That a cardinal had been held to account \u2013 once one of the most powerful men in the Vatican \u2013 was profound. Chrissie Foster, whose daughters Emma and Katie were raped by the Melbourne priest Kevin O\u2019Donnell while they were at a Catholic primary school in the 1980s, said the dismissal of Pell\u2019s appeal showed society\u2019s understanding of child sexual abuse had reached a point where being powerful did not offer the protection it once did. \u201cWhat a result \u2013 it is almost unbelievable,\u201d she told reporters. \u201cI was not expecting this.

This is a crime fraught with not getting a guilty verdict.\u201d Before the court doors opened on Wednesday morning people lined up before 7am despite the cold and the drizzle to ensure they would secure a seat in the courtroom.

Several Senate Democrats followed suit, including other 2020 contenders such as <strong>Senators Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris, and Elizabeth Warren</strong>.</p> <p>But Gillibrand\u2019s move was widely viewed as what kicked off the calls for Franken\u2019s resignation, earning her the scorn of some within the Democratic party\u2019s donor class. <strong>The New York senator has often been asked to defend her decision </strong>while competing in the 2020 Democratic primaries, where she has struggled to break through and continues to poll in single digits.</p> <p>A recent profile of Franken in the <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/07/29/the-case-of-al-franken\">New Yorker</a> revived the issue by looking back at the moment from the former senator\u2019s point of view. In the long-form story, Franken poked holes in the account of his first and most prominent accuser, TV host Leeann Tweeden, and said he \u201cabsolutely\u201d regretted his decision to resign from the Senate.</p> <p>Gillibrand pushed back on the efforts to downplay the allegations, stating: \u201cI think just picking apart one allegation is really harmful. I think it\u2019s harmful to the larger moment that we\u2019re in.\u201d</p> <p>She went on to say Franken was entitled to \u201cany measure of investigation that he wanted\u201d and that it was his ultimately his own decision to step down. </p> <p>\u201cWhat he\u2019s not entitled to -- and I want to be clearly on this -- is my silence,\u201d Gillibrand said. \u201cHe\u2019s not entitled to the Democratic party being in his corner.\u201d</p> <p>Gillibrand, who has spent much of her career combating sexual assault, did suggest there was room for forgiveness \u201cfor anyone who wants it\u201d:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It just is a matter of having the humility and grace to take responsibility, to know that you need to say you\u2019re sorry and move on from there.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-08-20T17:48:33.280Z\">at 6.48pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d5c21438f081cf11cf19f4c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-20T16:41:27.416Z\">5.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Not all Fox News anchors are willing to do Donald Trump\u2019s bidding.</p> <p>Bret Baier, a longtime host at the network, took issue with the president for criticizing Fox News after its <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fox-news-poll-8-15\">polling</a> found Trump trailing several 2020 Democratic candidates.</p> <p>After the Fox News survey was released, Trump said there was \u201csomething going on\u201d at his preferred network, while adding: \u201cI\u2019ll tell you right now, and I\u2019m not happy with it.\u201d </p> <p>During his Monday evening broadcast, Baier hit back at Trump for questioning the legitimacy of the poll and sought to draw a distinction between the network\u2019s news and opinion programming.</p> <p>\u201cFox has not changed.

He also ranks highly on electability, with voters seemingly buying into Biden\u2019s argument that he is best positioned to defeat Donald Trump. But among liberal voters, the race is effectively a three-way tie between Biden, Sanders and Warren, proving there is room yet for one of Biden\u2019s rivals to topple his lead. </p> <p><strong>A word of caution:</strong> There are still more than five months remaining until Democratic voters cast their ballots in the primaries. A lot can change before the crucial Iowa caucuses and early voting contests in New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada.

      "bodyText": "This is Lois Beckett, wrapping up tonight\u2019s live politics coverage with an updated recap of the day\u2019s key political events: Trump renewed his attacks on representatives Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib after they were barred from entering Israel by Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government; in highly controversial comments, the president went on to suggest any Jewish person who votes for Democrats \u201cshows either a total lack of knowledge or great disloyalty\u201d. In the two weeks since a gunman killed 22 people in El Paso, law enforcement officials say they have thwarted six separate mass shootings or white supremacist attacks across the US. The suspects in these recent cases targeted LGBTQ people, Jewish people, black Americans, Latinos and Muslims, according to law enforcement and media reports. Four of the suspects were white men in their 20s, and all but one of them were believed to be armed, some with extensive weaponry. Donald Trump has walked further away from legislation to expand background checks on gun sales in the wake of a series of mass shootings, telling reporters he was elected by strong supporters of the second amendment; without Trump\u2019s backing, there\u2019s virtually no gun reforms that would pass a divided Congress. According to one report, the president personally called NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre today to tell him that background check legislation is off the table. LaPierre confirmed, via a tweet, that he had spoken with Trump, and called him \u201cstrong\u201d on gun rights. President Trump also tweeted on Tuesday evening that he was canceling a visit to Denmark and postponing a visit with the Danish prime minister over the prime minister\u2019s remarks that Greenland, which Trump said he wanted the United States to buy, was \u201cnot for sale.\u201d In the two weeks since a gunman killed 22 people in El Paso, law enforcement officials say they have thwarted six separate mass shootings or white supremacist attacks across the US. In online posts and in their alleged planned massacres, the suspects in these recent cases targeted LGBTQ people, Jewish people, black Americans, Latinos and Muslims, according to law enforcement and media reports. Four of the suspects were white men in their 20s, and all but one of them were believed to be armed, some with extensive weaponry, my colleague Sam Levin reports. Read more: National Rifle Association CEO Wayne LaPierre confirmed, via a tweet, that he spoke with President Trump today about gun laws, and called him a \u201cstrong\u201d president. The Atlantic reported earlier this afternoon that Trump had called LaPierre to reassure him that any background check legislation was now off the table. Donald Trump said on Tuesday evening that he is postponing a scheduled meeting with the Danish prime minister over her comments on his proposal for the US to buy the island. Denmark owns Greenland, and the country has said the island is not for sale. Mette Frederiksen, the Danish prime minister, said on Sunday: \u201cGreenland is not for sale. Greenland is not Danish. Greenland belongs to Greenland. I strongly hope that this is not meant seriously.\u201d A White House official confirmed that Trump had canceled a scheduled visit to Denmark, according to Reuters. We\u2019ve seen this entire news cycle before: A good question from Los Angeles Times 2020 correspondent Matt Pearce: The National Rifle Association is in total disarray. It\u2019s struggling financially, ensnared in legal battles, shedding board members, and with its second-in-command, chief lobbyist Chris Cox, exiled from the group after allegations that he participated in an attempted coup against executive vice president and CEO Wayne LaPierre. So why does it appear that LaPierre was still able to get the president to back away from his public endorsement of passing new background check legislation? My answer: If you believe that the real barriers to passing gun control are NRA dollars and the political savvy of NRA leadership, you would expect Republican politicians to start breaking with the NRA right about now. But if you believe the real barrier to passing gun control is a dedicated minority of pro-gun Republican primary voters--organized, reliable, single-issue voters who could be a decisive margin in any close race--then you\u2019d expect little GOP movement right now, despite the NRA\u2019s woes. It doesn\u2019t matter much to you, as a Republican politician, if 90%+ of voters overall vaguely support expanding background checks, if the tiny percentage of people who oppose them will definitely be turning up to the polls, in your district, in a close race, to vote against you. The Atlantic\u2019s Elaina Plott is reporting that Donald Trump called the National Rifle Association CEO, Wayne LaPierre, this afternoon to tell him that any push for legislation to expand requirements for background checks on gun sales was off the table. Two weeks ago, after the United States saw two major mass shootings in two cities in less than 24 hours, leaving a total of 31 people dead, Trump had suggested publicly that he would support significant legislation to expand federal requirements for background checks on gun sales, a policy with overwhelming public support. But the president\u2019s public rhetoric embracing the idea of passing background check legislation had already cooled after a previous phone conversation with Wayne LaPierre, the NRA\u2019s executive vice-president and CEO. The NRA spent more than $30m to back Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 White House bid, more than any other outside group. In a phone call today, Plott reported, citing an unnamed source briefed on the call, Trump told LaPierre that he did not want to pursue background check legislation, and that he would focus instead on mental health funding and tougher prosecution of gun crimes. Earlier today, Trump publicly echoed the NRA\u2019s talking points, telling White House reporters, \u201cWe have very, very strong background checks right now,\u201d and adding, \u201cA lot of the people who put me where I am are strong supporters of the second amendment.\u201d Currently, private American citizens in most states can sell firearms to each other without any legal requirement to conduct a background check of criminal and mental health records, although licensed firearms dealers are required to conduct a background check. The major goal of the American gun control movement for the past decade has simply been to pass a law requiring a background check before every gun sale. This is Lois Beckett, in the Guardian\u2019s west coast office, picking up the politics blog for the evening. The Sunrise Movement, the new, youth-led environmental activist group, is celebrating the announcement from Kamala Harris\u2019 campaign that she will be attending CNN\u2019s climate change summit. The campaign had previously said she would not attend, citing a scheduling conflict. But one of the group\u2019s founders said that the Democratic party itself still needs to hold its own climate debate for 2020 presidential candidates, and pledged that \u201chundreds of us will turn up\u201d this week to pressure the Democratic National Committee to host its own debate. \u201cA climate debate would show which politicians are ready to take this crisis seriously and give millions of young people a sense of hope and possibility unlike anything we\u2019ve felt in years,\u201d Varshini Prakash said in a statement. It is time for me to hand the blog over to my trusted colleagues on the west coast, so that\u2019s it from me, Sabrina Siddiqui. But before I go, here\u2019s a recap of the day\u2019s events so far: Donald Trump has walked further away from legislation to expand background checks in the wake of a series of mass shootings, telling reporters he was elected by strong supporters of the second amendment; without Trump\u2019s backing, there\u2019s virtually no gun reforms that would pass a divided Congress. Trump also renewed his attacks on representatives Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib after they were barred from entering Israel by Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government; in highly controversial comments, the president went on to suggest any Jewish person who votes for Democrats \u201cshows either a total lack of knowledge or great disloyalty\u201d. Also from Trump\u2019s wide-ranging comments at the White House on Tuesday: the president is renewing his call for Russia to rejoin the G-7 ahead of the group\u2019s annual meeting in France next week. Joe Biden continues to hold a commanding lead over his 2020 Democratic rivals, with a new poll showing the former vice-president ahead of other contenders by double-digits. The same survey found California senator Kamala Harris drop back to single digits after experiencing a brief surge stemming from her performance in the first Democratic presidential debate in June. 2020 presidential candidate Kirsten Gillibrand stood by her decision to lead the calls for former US senator Al Franken\u2019s resignation after he was accused by multiple women of sexual misconduct; Gillibrand, who has been struggling to gain traction in the Democratic primaries, forcefully rejected the notion that Franken was not given due process when the allegations were made, stating it was ultimately his decision to retire. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, acknowledged Islamic State militants are regaining strength in certain areas; Pompeo\u2019s comments contradict Trump\u2019s repeated claims that he has \u201ctotally defeated ISIS\u201d. Over to Lois Beckett on the west coast for more. Watch this space! Donald Trump defended Israel\u2019s controversial decision to bar Representatives Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib from entering the country. The president also denied having any involvement in the matter, despite publicly pressuring the Israeli government not to let Omar and Tlaib, the first two Muslim women elected to the US Congress, visit the country. \u201cThat\u2019s a decision of Israel. They can let them in if they want,\u201d Trump said at the White House. Omar and Tlaib had planned to travel to Israel last week but were banned by Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government. The Israeli prime minister cited the two Democratic lawmakers\u2019 support for the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement in justifying his actions. Siding with the Israeli government over US elected officials, Trump told reporters: \u201cIt was all going to be a propaganda tour against Israel, so I don\u2019t blame Israel for doing what they did.\u201d The president also doubled down on his criticism of Tlaib for becoming emotional during a press conference on Monday when speaking about her grandmother, who lives in the occupied West Bank. \u201cAll of a sudden, she starts the tears, and I don\u2019t buy it for a second,\u201d Trump said of Tlaib, who is the first Palestinian American to serve in Congress. \u201cI\u2019ve seen her in a very vicious mood. I saw a woman that was violent and vicious and out of control,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd all of a sudden I see this person who\u2019s crying because she can\u2019t see her grandmother.\u201d In one particularly jarring statement, Trump went on the criticize any Jewish American who supports the Democratic Party. \u201cI think any Jewish people that vote for a Democrat \u2014 I think it shows either a total lack of knowledge or great disloyalty,\u201d the president said. Trump also addressed negotiations with China and insisted his trade war with Beijing was working, despite fears of a potential economic recession. \u201cChina\u2019s been grifting off this country for 25 years,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe fact is, somebody had to take China on.\u201d He added: \u201cMy life would be a lot easier if I didn\u2019t take China on. But I like doing it, because I have to do it.\u201d Last week, Trump delayed the implementation of proposed tariffs on a host of Chinese imports until December in a bid to prevent US consumers from incurring higher prices during the holiday season. \u201cI am doing this whether it\u2019s good or bad,\u201d Trump added of his aggressive trade practices. Donald Trump addressed a wide range of issues in his comments to reporters from the Oval Office, including trade talks with China, Russia and the G7 and Israel\u2019s ban on Representatives Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib. Here are the top-lines: Russia and Vladimir Putin The president reiterated his view that Russia should be allowed to rejoin the G7, stating: \u201cI think it\u2019s much more appropriate to have Russia in.\u201d \u201cA lot of the things we talk about have to do with Russia,\u201d Trump said of the group that includes the world\u2019s most advanced economies. \u201cI could certainly see it being the G8 again. If someone would make that motion, i would be disposed to think about it favorably.\u201d Trump\u2019s made the comments days days before he is poised to attend the annual G7 meeting in France. Russia was suspended from the group by the US and allied countries in 2014 in response to its annexation of Crimea. Trump claimed Barack Obama led the charge \u201cbecause Putin outsmarted him\u201d. Boris Johnson Trump lavished praise on the new UK prime minister, telling reporters Johnson was going to be \u201cfar superior\u201d in a thinly-veiled shot at Theresa May. \u201cI think he\u2019s going to do a fantastic job,\u201d Trump said of Johnson. \u201cI\u2019ve known him. A lot of people know we have a good relationship.\u201d US presence in Afghanistan Trump once again signaled he was looking to wrap up US military involvement in Afghanistan, stating that negotiations were ongoing with the Afghan government and the Taliban. \u201cWe\u2019ve been there for 18 years, we\u2019ve taken it down a notch,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019re not really fighting, we\u2019re almost more of a police force over there.\u201d The president, who has been warned against abruptly withdrawing US troops from the region, nonetheless said Afghanistan was \u201ca dangerous place\u201d, while adding: \u201cWe always have to keep an eye on it.\u201d Stay tuned for more ... Donald Trump has once again moved away from supporting stricter background checks legislation, telling reporters at the White House the US already has strong laws on the books. \u201cWe have very, very strong background checks right now,\u201d Trump said while taking questions from the press in the Oval Office. \u201cA lot of the people who put me where I am are strong supporters of the second amendment.\u201d Echoing talking points from the National Rifle Association, the president said expanding background checks was a \u201cslippery slope\u201d that could lead to a situation where \u201ceverything gets taken away\u201d. \u201cThey think you approve one thing, and that leads to a lot of bad things. I don\u2019t agree with that,\u201d Trump said. The president declined to comment on gun control measures being pushed by House Democrats. A recent spate of mass shootings revived the debate over US gun laws but has yet to produce a breakthrough. After initially suggesting he was open to enhancing background checks, Trump has in recent days backed down from embracing any new measures that would close loopholes or tighten gun laws. Polling has consistently shown that nearly 90% of the American public supports universal background checks. Donald Trump has apparently misstated the value and profitability of his Scotland golf courses by $165m, according to a report published Tuesday. Citing US financial disclosure statements filed by Trump for 2018, HuffPost reported that Trump claimed his resorts in Turnberry and Aberdeen were each worth more than $50m. At the same time, the website found that balance sheets Trump filed with the United Kingdom showed the combined debt for the two properties exceeded their assets by 47.9m British pounds, which at the time of the filing would amount to the rough equivalent of $64.8m. More from HuffPost below: His 2018 \u201cpublic financial disclosure\u201d filed with the U.S. Office of Government Ethics also claims those two resorts earned him \u201cincome\u201d of $23.8 million. His filings with the U.K. Companies House office in Edinburgh for that period showed the resorts had actually lost 4.6 million pounds \u2015 equal to $6.3 million. His U.S. disclosure statement also fails to mention $199.5 million in loans Trump has made to those resorts: $54.9 million from him personally to Trump International, Scotland in Aberdeenshire; $144.6 million from his trust to Trump Turnberry in Ayrshire.\u201d The website points out that knowingly providing false or incomplete information on US financial disclosure forms is a violation of federal law. Signing a form containing false information can also amount to making a false statement, which is punishable by up to five years in jail. A longtime Republican operative has resigned from the board of a conservative LGBTQ group following its endorsement of Donald Trump in 2020. In a resignation letter to the leadership of the Log Cabin Republicans, an LGBTQ advocacy group aligned with the GOP, Jennifer Horn wrote: \u201cI could never endorse him for President of the United States and still look my children in the eye.\u201d \u201cIn order to maintain favor with this unprincipled, unscrupulous President, too many in our party are fast abandoning the moral high ground,\u201d she added, \u201cand I fear that in this endorsement, the Log Cabin Republicans have damaged our ability to effectively advocate for equal rights for all.\u201d Horn served as the chairwoman of the New Hampshire Republican Party in 2016. That year, the board of the Log Cabin Republicans voted against endorsing Trump, despite backing previous Republican presidential nominees Mitt Romney and John McCain. In a major reversal, the group publicly threw its support behind Trump\u2019s re-election on Friday. \u201cWhile we do not agree with every policy or platform position presented by the White House or the Republican Party, we share a commitment to individual responsibility, personal freedom and a strong national defense,\u201d Log Cabin Republicans Chairman Robert Kabel and Vice Chairwoman Jill Homan wrote in a Washington Post op-ed. That did not sit well with Horn, who said she made a decision long ago that she would not support Trump\u2019s candidacy in 2020. In her letter, she condemned the president\u2019s \u201cregular verbal assaults against women, immigrants, elected members of Congress, party members who do not agree with him on policy or principle and his willingness to stoke racial anger and unrest in order to advance his own political ambitions\u201d. Defending its endorsement, Log Cabin Republicans pointed to the Trump administration\u2019s push to decriminalize homosexuality around the world and the president\u2019s appointment of Richard Grenell, who is openly gay, as the ambassador to Germany. The group also touted a proposal by Trump to combat the spread of HIV/AIDS. But Trump has drawn a great deal of criticism for his actions against LGBTQ rights, which include imposing a ban on transgender people in the military and rolling back Obama-era protections for LGBTQ federal workers. 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Kirsten Gillibrand has faced consistent scrutiny over her role in calling for the resignation of former US Senator Al Franken after he was accused of sexual misconduct. But Gillibrand said she has no regrets in a new interview with The New York Times\u2019 podcast \u2018The Daily\u2019, which revisits the 2017 controversy surrounding Franken and renewed debate over whether he was treated unfairly. Recounting her decision to call for Franken to resign, Gillibrand said: \u201cWith each allegation, as it grew, it created more and more concern in my mind.\u201d \u201cI couldn\u2019t defend him. I couldn\u2019t carry his water, and my silence was doing exactly that,\u201d she added. \u201cSo I got to the point where I wanted to say, very clearly, that I didn\u2019t think it was acceptable and that I felt that he really needed to resign.\u201d Gillibrand was not alone in calling for Franken to resign after eight women accused him of inappropriate behavior that included forcible kissing and groping them without their consent. Several Senate Democrats followed suit, including other 2020 contenders such as Senators Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris, and Elizabeth Warren. But Gillibrand\u2019s move was widely viewed as what kicked off the calls for Franken\u2019s resignation, earning her the scorn of some within the Democratic party\u2019s donor class. The New York senator has often been asked to defend her decision while competing in the 2020 Democratic primaries, where she has struggled to break through and continues to poll in single digits. A recent profile of Franken in the New Yorker revived the issue by looking back at the moment from the former senator\u2019s point of view. In the long-form story, Franken poked holes in the account of his first and most prominent accuser, TV host Leeann Tweeden, and said he \u201cabsolutely\u201d regretted his decision to resign from the Senate. Gillibrand pushed back on the efforts to downplay the allegations, stating: \u201cI think just picking apart one allegation is really harmful. I think it\u2019s harmful to the larger moment that we\u2019re in.\u201d She went on to say Franken was entitled to \u201cany measure of investigation that he wanted\u201d and that it was his ultimately his own decision to step down. \u201cWhat he\u2019s not entitled to -- and I want to be clearly on this -- is my silence,\u201d Gillibrand said. \u201cHe\u2019s not entitled to the Democratic party being in his corner.\u201d Gillibrand, who has spent much of her career combating sexual assault, did suggest there was room for forgiveness \u201cfor anyone who wants it\u201d: It just is a matter of having the humility and grace to take responsibility, to know that you need to say you\u2019re sorry and move on from there.\u201d Not all Fox News anchors are willing to do Donald Trump\u2019s bidding. Bret Baier, a longtime host at the network, took issue with the president for criticizing Fox News after its polling found Trump trailing several 2020 Democratic candidates. After the Fox News survey was released, Trump said there was \u201csomething going on\u201d at his preferred network, while adding: \u201cI\u2019ll tell you right now, and I\u2019m not happy with it.\u201d During his Monday evening broadcast, Baier hit back at Trump for questioning the legitimacy of the poll and sought to draw a distinction between the network\u2019s news and opinion programming. \u201cFox has not changed. The opinion folks express their opinions,\u201d Baier said. \u201cWe do polls. Our latest poll had the Democratic candidates, head-to-head, several of them ahead of President Trump.\u201d \u201cThis poll matches what we are seeing out there, Mr. President,\u201d he added. Baier proceeded to invite Trump to appear on his show, noting that he was among the anchors at Fox News who \u201ccover it fair, balanced and unafraid\u201d. Donald Trump has lashed out at Michigan representative Rashida Tlaib for getting visibly emotional in a press conference after she was barred from entering Israel alongside Minnesota representative Ilhan Omar. \u201cSorry, I don\u2019t buy Rep. Tlaib\u2019s tears. I have watched her violence, craziness and, most importantly, WORDS, for far too long. Now tears?\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cShe hates Israel and all Jewish people. She is an anti-Semite. She and her 3 friends are the new face of the Democrat Party. Live with it!\u201d Trump\u2019s tweet came one day after Tlaib and Omar held a joint press conference denouncing the travel restrictions imposed upon them by the Israeli government. Last week, the two Muslim congresswomen were controversially denied permission to visit Israel -- forcing them to suspend a planned trip -- after Trump pressured Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu not to let them in. The Israeli government later said Tlaib, the only Palestinian American to serve in Congress, could visit her grandmother in the occupied West Bank if she applied on humanitarian grounds and vowed not to criticize Israel\u2019s actions. Addressing reporters on Monday, Tlaib said she would not travel under \u201coppressive conditions meant to humiliate me\u201d. She broke down when explaining her decision to decline a visit to her 90-year-old grandmother, stating: \u201cWe all decided as a family that I could not go until I was a free, American, United States congresswoman.\u201d \u201cShe said I\u2019m her dream manifested. I am her free bird,\u201d Tlaib added of her grandmother, holding back tears. \u201cSo why would I come back and be caged and bow down when my election rose her head up high?\u201d Former White House press secretary Sean Spicer is taking on an expanded role in the 2020 election, leading the Republican party\u2019s fundraising efforts. The Washington Examiner reported on Tuesday that Spicer, whose tenure as Donald Trump\u2019s top spokesman was repeatedly beset by controversy, will focus specifically on helping Republican win back the House majority. Spicer has remained in the public eye since departing the White House, often appearing on Fox News to defend the president. He also penned a memoir on his stint as press secretary, but it did not go quite as planned. Turns out, the American public is not particularly interested in the guy who lied about Trump\u2019s crowd sizes and once referred to concentration camps as \u201cHolocaust centers\u201d. Many will perhaps best associate Spicer with Melissa McCarthy\u2019s brutal portrayal of the former White House spokesman on Saturday Night Live. (In case you want to take a trip down memory lane, here\u2019s the spoof that Spicer joked cost him \u201ca lot of money in therapy\u201d.) Add former Senate majority leader Harry Reid to the list of prominent Democrats cautioning the party against taking too leftward a turn. In an interview with VICE News, Reid specifically took aim at the single-payer healthcare plan Medicare-for-All and embrace by some Democrats of decriminalizing border crossings. Asked if support for Medicare-for-All, which was introduced by Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, could prove challenging in the 2020 general election, Reid responded: \u201cOf course it would be. How are you going to get it passed?\u201d \u201cI think that we should focus on improving Obamacare. We can do that \u2014 without bringing something that would be much harder to sell,\u201d Reid added. \u201cImproving Obamacare: People understand that. They would appreciate that. It locks in many important things.\u201d The interview, which was published on Tuesday, is not the first time Reid has weighed in on the 2020 Democratic primaries. Earlier this year, the former Nevada senator said Democrats should spend more time talking about issues and devote less time to Donald Trump. But Reid\u2019s comments to VICE News reflect a sharper tone toward the sprawling Democratic field and the ongoing debate between the party\u2019s moderate and progressive wings. Immigration ranks among the issues that has split 2020 Democrats as the party grapples with how to best push back against the Trump administration\u2019s draconian policies. Some candidates have called for decriminalizing the act of crossing the border unauthorized. Reid questioned the prominence of the debate, stating: \u201cThere are so many more important things to do.\u201d \u201cDecriminalizing border crossings is not something that should be at the top of the list,\u201d he said. \u201cIt should be way, way down at the bottom of the list.\u201d Reid has pledged not to endorse a presidential candidate before the influential Nevada caucuses in his home state. He has lavished praise on all of the US senators seeking the Democratic party\u2019s nomination, as well as former vice president Joe Biden. Reid told VICE News he thinks \u201cthe world\u201d of Biden and also singled out Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren. \u201cI\u2019m not going to endorse anyone until after the caucuses but everyone has to be impressed with what she\u2019s doing,\u201d he said. Fox News host Tucker Carlson returned to his primetime show on Monday for the first time since he was widely criticized for dismissing the threat of white supremacy as a \u201choax\u201d. But many of Carlson\u2019s advertisers did not return with him, according to the liberal watchdog group Media Matters for America. Earlier this month, Carlson abruptly declared he was embarking on a weeklong trip \u201cto the wilderness\u201d with his son amid an uproar over the host downplaying white nationalism in the wake of the mass shooting in El Paso, Texas. Media Matters nonetheless found that Carlson\u2019s absence from Fox News has done little to stop advertisers from fleeing the embattled host. The group found that at least five advertisers -- including brand names such as Nestle and HelloFresh -- ditched Carlson\u2019s show over the last 11 days. Media Matters further estimated that Carlson, one of Donald Trump\u2019s biggest boosters, has lost a staggering 70 paid advertisers since December. While several advertisers continue to feature on Fox News, at least one -- fast-food chain Long John Silver\u2019s -- pulled itself from the network entirely. Fox News downplayed any issues with its advertisers in a statement. \u201cFox News is on track to deliver another record year in advertising revenue,\u201d Jeff Collins, the network\u2019s executive vice president of advertising sales, said in a statement. \u201cAdvertising budgets that were impacted have been re-expressed into other programs across the network.\u201d Carlson has been a controversial figure at the network, which has largely worked in concert with the Trump White House. The initial drop in advertisers in December came after Carlson claimed immigrants had \u201cplundered\u201d America\u2019s wealth and suggested they made the country \u201cpoorer and dirtier\u201d. \u201cFox News sent Tucker Carlson on vacation in hopes of stemming the tide of advertiser losses,\u201d Media Matters president Angelo Carusone tweeted. \u201cInstead, advertisers have only increased the drop rate in order to get off the show (and some off Fox News entirely) before Tucker is [scheduled] to return.\u201d Democratic presidential candidate Kirsten Gillibrand on Tuesday unveiled a proposal to expand mental health services, dubbing the issue as a \u201cgrowing crisis\u201d in America. Gillibrand\u2019s mental health plan would direct federal funds toward community health centers and behavioral clinics, as well as invest in training for healthcare professionals to reduce bias against people of color and other vulnerable populations. \u201cTranscending race, gender, age, religion, or life experience, mental health is a growing crisis in our country \u2014 and it has gone without sufficient attention, care or resources for too long,\u201d Gillibrand wrote. \u201cAntiquated stigma and systemic failures have kept millions of Americans from sharing their suffering with others, forcing them to struggle quietly.\u201d Gillibrand has struggled to gain traction in the Democratic field and has yet to qualify for next month\u2019s presidential debate in Houston, Texas. The New York senator is nonetheless continuing to press forward with her campaign in the hopes of creating momentum. In case you\u2019re wondering what Donald Trump is up to this morning, he is ... wait for it ... tweeting. And the president clearly still has Anthony Scaramucci \u2013 aka \u201cThe Mooch\u201d \u2013 on his mind, dismissing the ex-White House communications director as a \u201cdisgruntled former employee who got fired for gross incompetence\u201d. What is this all about, you ask? Well, it all began when Scaramucci publicly withdrew his support for Trump after the two men traded barbs over the president\u2019s rhetoric on race and immigration in the wake of the mass shooting in El Paso. Scaramucci went on to say he was assembling a coalition to stop Trump in the 2020 election. Scaramucci-who? Republicans have criticized the media for giving Scaramucci airtime, given his record short tenure in the White House. Scaramucci served as Trump\u2019s communications director for a mere 11 days before he was fired for delivering a profanity-laced tirade against other White House aides in an interview with the New Yorker. Of course, Trump has spent several days directing his ire at Scaramucci over social media. The latest: In an op-ed published by the Washington Post late Monday, Scaramucci deepened his criticism of the president and pushed back against criticisms that he only turned on his former boss because Trump first turned on him: I broke from Trump because not only has his behavior become more erratic and his rhetoric more inflammatory, but also because, like all demagogues, he is incapable of handling constructive criticism. As we lie on the bed of nails Trump has made, it\u2019s often difficult to see how much the paradigm of acceptable conduct has shifted. For the Republican Party, it\u2019s now a question of whether we want to start cleaning up the mess or continue papering over the cracks.\u201d Joe Biden may have a hold over the frontrunner mantle, but Elizabeth Warren appears to have the momentum. The Massachusetts senator and progressive icon drew a mammoth crowd of roughly 12,000 at her first campaign event in Minnesota on Monday. According to Warren\u2019s campaign, it was the largest crowd she has seen while barnstorming the country over the past eight months. Warren has steadily gained traction in the crowded Democratic field by introducing herself to voters one policy at a time. She has largely stayed out of the back-and-forth between other candidates, focusing instead on an agenda rooted in tackling corruption, restructuring the economy and expanding access to education while reducing student loan debt. \u201cIf you want to get something done, you ought to have a plan for it,\u201d Warren told the crowd in Minnesota. \u201cBelieve me, I plan to get something done.\u201d Joe Biden continues to hold a commanding lead over other 2020 Democratic presidential candidates, according to a new poll released by CNN on Tuesday. The survey found that 29% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters support the former vice president, as no other contender in the sprawling field made substantive gains. Biden\u2019s numbers, by contrast, rose seven points from a CNN poll conducted in late June following his widely panned appearance in the first Democratic presidential debate. California senator Kamala Harris, whose saw a post-debate bounce due to her fiery confrontation with Biden on race and segregation, has meanwhile dropped by a 12-point margin in the latest poll. Progressive favorites Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are running neck-in-neck, at 15% and 14%, respectively, but still trailing Biden by double digits. Why this matters: Biden\u2019s uneven performances in the debates, coupled with fresh scrutiny over his gaffes, has had little tangible impact on his political standing thus far. Whereas other candidates have been boosted by moments, Biden has proven a durable frontrunner in the early stages of the primary. Between the numbers: Biden\u2019s position is bolstered by approval from moderate and conservative Democrats, as well as older voters. He also ranks highly on electability, with voters seemingly buying into Biden\u2019s argument that he is best positioned to defeat Donald Trump. But among liberal voters, the race is effectively a three-way tie between Biden, Sanders and Warren, proving there is room yet for one of Biden\u2019s rivals to topple his lead. A word of caution: There are still more than five months remaining until Democratic voters cast their ballots in the primaries. A lot can change before the crucial Iowa caucuses and early voting contests in New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada. It remains to be seen if Biden can hold onto his lead as the field narrows. US secretary of state Mike Pompeo acknowledged on Tuesday that Islamic State militants are gaining strength, contradicting Donald Trump\u2019s claims that he had defeated Isis. \u201cIt\u2019s complicated. There are certainly places where Isis is more powerful today than they were three or four years ago,\u201d Pompeo said in an interview with CBS This Morning, while adding: \u201cBut the caliphate is gone and their capacity to conduct external attacks has been made much more difficult.\u201d Pompeo\u2019s comments echo a report released by the Department of Defense earlier this month, which found that Isis militants were regaining strength due in part to the Trump administration\u2019s withdrawal of US troops from Syria and other policy shifts in Iraq. Although the report stated the group had lost its strongholds in both countries, it warned that Isis was \u201crebuilding its capabilities\u201d. Trump has repeatedly claimed he defeated Isis in the Middle East. Pompeo also conceded negotiations between the US and North Korea had stalled, stating the Trump administration knew there would be \u201cbumps on the road\u201d as the two countries looked to reach a deal on denuclearization. A profile published in the New Yorker on Monday cast Pompeo as the \u201clast survivor\u201d of Trump\u2019s original national security team and the president\u2019s most influential voice on foreign policy. The profile, which charts Pompeo\u2019s rise from a rank-and-file US congressman to America\u2019s top diplomat, also revived the secretary of state\u2019s previous criticisms of his now-boss. During the 2016 Republican primaries, Pompeo warned voters that Trump would be \u201can authoritarian president\u201d. Pompeo was backing Florida senator Marco Rubio at the time. Good morning everyone! Sabrina Siddiqui here, manning the politics live blog out of Washington. Famous last words, but a relatively quiet day is expected at the White House where Donald Trump is poised to meet with the president of Romania. Trump, for his part, rounded out his Monday night be reviving his attacks on former aide Anthony Scaramucci and teasing his potential purchase of Greenland. We\u2019ll keep an eye on any other developments from 1600 Pennsylvania Ave and break down the latest in the 2020 Democratic primaries, where Joe Biden remains a formidable contender. New polling has good news for the former vice-president, and not so good news for California senator Kamala Harris after her breakout moment in the first presidential debate. Stay tuned and watch this space!",

      "bodyText": "The Royal Australasian College of Physicians has been warned its charity status could be revoked if it fails to address regulator concerns about the use of charity funds for legal advice, hiring practices, and concerns about its handling of complaints. The college was investigated by the Australian charities and not-for-profit commission (ACNC) after its board and president elections in March 2018. Prof John Wilson was named president-elect and three new directors appointed to the board in a landslide victory: Prof Niki Ellis, Dr Jacqueline Small and Prof Paul Komesaroff. Complaints were lodged with the college about the conduct of Wilson and the others during the election after thousands of college members were emailed and urged to vote for the four as part of a \u201creform ticket\u201d. In particular, members were concerned that access to the email addresses of members might have breached the college bylaws or privacy law. The board appointed a third party to review the complaints, but only a redacted report of the findings was released. As a result of its investigation, ACNC issued the college with a compliance agreement in June. In a letter addressed to the college, obtained by Guardian Australia, the ACNC said it had concerns that the college \u201chas failed to maintain accountability and transparency to its members\u201d.

      "bodyText": "The global engineering and consultancy firm Aurecon has severed a longstanding business relationship with the Adani Group, amid ongoing efforts by anti-coal activists to target firms working for the Indian conglomerate\u2019s Australian mining arm. Adani Australia released a statement on Wednesday saying it was \u201csurprised\u201d by the decision but that the \u201cconcerted campaign\u201d against the Carmichael project by environmental groups had not succeeded, and that construction of the central Queensland thermal coalmine was under way. But the decision is likely to buoy activists groups\u2019 efforts to convince other major contractors to walk away. Their current focus is on another engineering consultant, GHD, which is working on the design of the mine. Julien Vincent, the executive director of Market Forces, an investor action group, said the stance taken by Aurecon \u201ccertainly doesn\u2019t surprise us\u201d. \u201cAdani\u2019s Carmichael coalmine project, along with the company\u2019s corporate record make it brand kryptonite for any company that they are associated with,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cAurecon joins a long list of companies to have walked away form the Carmichael project, or ruled out providing financial support to Adani\u2019s dirty coalmine. \u201cWe\u2019ve found many people working in engineering firms want to participate in projects that advance a technologically advanced, sustainable economy. It should surprise nobody that employees at companies like Aurecon would want to disassociate from companies like Adani that are trying to exacerbate that crisis.\u201d In its statement, Adani said it was already in discussions with other businesses who had expressed an interest in taking on Aurecon\u2019s work or other opportunities with the company. \u201cWhile we are surprised by the decision, given the positive long-term relationship and the fact that we are not aware of any commercial issues or disputes between our companies, we value the work that Aurecon has delivered for our port and renewable energy businesses. \u201cThere has been a concerted campaign by extremists against our Carmichael project and businesses that partner with us. It has not succeeded and construction of the Carmichael project is well and truly under way. \u201cWe have repeatedly demonstrated that we will not be intimidated or deterred from delivering on our promises to Queenslanders, Australians and the people in developing nations who desperately need affordable energy to help lift them out of poverty.\u201d Aurecon had not been directly involved in the Carmichael mine \u2013 it had been the engineering, procurement and construction contractor at the Abbot Point coal terminal since 2005. Adani bought the terminal in 2011. This month environmental groups, including those using civil disobedience tactics, held a week of action targeting GHD in an attempt to convince the company to stop working with Adani. There are relatively few engineering firms with the capacity to design and build Carmichael. Another global firm, AECOM, had been designing a railway between Carmichael and Abbot Point, but walked away amid a financial dispute. A deal with integrated services firm Downer EDI collapsed in 2017 after the company was pressured by activists. Firms who do work with Adani are likely to be pressured by staff, shareholders, business partners and financiers, as well as outside activists. Last week Engineers without Borders ended a longstanding partnership with GHD. According to its 2018 financial report, GHD holds \u201cmulti-option, multi-currency facilities\u201d with both Westpac and HSBC, two financial institutions who have policies ruling out financing the Adani Carmichael coalmine. Market Forces says it would be \u201cshameful\u201d for companies to promote policies banning finance for thermal coal but to effectively do so through backing contractors to projects. \u201cCustomers and shareholders will be furious to learn that they are financially connected to this environmental disaster,\u201d said a Market Forces campaigner, Pablo Brait. \u201cIf Westpac and HSBC have any regard for their own commitments, they will either cancel their line of credit to GHD or convince the company to drop Adani\u2019s dirty coalmine. \u201cWe urge all banks and insurance companies that have pledged to avoid the Adani Carmichael project to closely examine who Adani\u2019s business partners are, as there is a risk they could be funding this destructive project indirectly.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A handful of big irrigators are responsible for 86% of water extracted from the Barwon-Darling river system, pushing the lower Darling into drought three years early, an expert report has found. The NSW Natural Resources Commission released the report by the Australian Rivers Institute professor Fran Sheldon on Monday night, after it received criticism for the claim that extraction of water by cotton growers had pushed the river system into hydrological drought three years early. Sheldon found that of the 158 licence holders in the Barwon-Darling, just 10 control 86% of the water extracted and four control 75%. These four include the Harris family, which faces prosecution for extracting during low flows, and the publicly listed Webster Ltd. The report found that the combination of the 2012 water-sharing rules and changes in climate have increased the warming and drying trend in the basin and that these factors were combining to pose serious risks to the Barwon-Darling system. \u201cThe most significant risk is the failure of water management approaches to meet the \u2018maintenance\u2019 flows for the Barwon-Darling, resulting in a loss of ecosystem resilience,\u201d the report found. \u201cThe volume of water extracted under the A Class Licence rules [the highest level of water rights] has increased since 2012 due to changes in access arrangements made in 2012, with a marked increase in the volume between 2014- 2017,\u201d the report found. \u201cExtraction patterns that occur in the low flows and base-flows are most severe when they intersect with larger climate phenomena, such as the onset of El Ni\u00f1o conditions,\u201d Sheldon said. The 2012 water-sharing rules have been highly contentious. Then water minister Katrina Hodgkinson made changes to rules after they had been put on public exhibition, following lobbying by the cotton industry. This included changes to when irrigators could pump during low flow events and changes to the rules that allowed them to take up to 300% of their entitlement in one year. This has resulted in enormous volumes being extracted upstream during the drought. Sheldon concluded that these two rules had pushed the Lower Darling, below Bourke\u2019s cotton farms, into hydrological drought three years early. Sheldon said she had used multiple lines of evidence to conclude that \u201cthese extractions from the base flow band could have essentially pushed the Barwon-Darling system below Bourke into very low flow conditions three years earlier than the river upstream.\u201d The Independent Commission against Corruption is believed to have looked at events around the finalising of the plan as part of its investigation into allegations of water theft by irrigators raised by Four Corners. It is unclear whether Icac plans to hold a public inquiry. The rules are now being reviewed and the Natural Resources Commission has recommended urgent changes to save the Barwon-Darling from ecological collapse. Sheldon said new rules were needed to protect flows throughout the year by restricting pumping levels for A-class licences. The federal government committed in April to buy back A-class licences in the Barwon Darling, after an independent report into this year\u2019s fish kills recommended a major refinement of basin management. A change in the rules would affect the value of the licences, as Class A licences would no longer be able extract water during very low flows. The Australian Financial Review has reported that several cotton growers are offering to sell B-class licences, but these would yield water savings only when the river is flowing. The major issue in the Barwon Darling is the A-class licences and the generous rules that allow the holders to access water during low flows.",

Maduro\u2019s remarks came after two reports in the US media claimed Diosdado Cabello, one of Venezuela\u2019s most powerful and feared men, had been engaged in \u201csecret communications\u201d with Trump officials. On Sunday Axios claimed that in recent months Cabello, the 56-year-old head of Venezuela\u2019s pro-Maduro constituent assembly, had been communicating with Trump\u2019s top Latin America adviser, Mauricio Claver-Carone. Some Trump officials reportedly considered that a positive sign suggesting Maduro\u2019s circle was \u201cgradually cracking\u201d. The Associated Press claimed Cabello had met someone \u201cin close contact with the Trump administration\u201d in Caracas last month and that a second meeting was envisioned. The US reportedly hoped engaging with Cabello would intensify an internal \u201cknife fight\u201d supposedly raging at the pinnacle of Maduro\u2019s administration. Observers of Venezuelan politics greeted those reports \u2013 apparently designed to destablise Maduro\u2019s crisis-stricken administration by stoking paranoia within his inner-circle - with scepticism. Christopher Sabatini, a senior fellow for Latin America at the Chatham House thinktank, said: \u201cI think what the US is trying to do is some sort of psy ops thing, trying to rattle people within Maduro\u2019s administration.\u201d But on Tuesday Maduro confirmed contact with the US, which he painted as proof that he had been seeking ways \u201cfor president Donald Trump to truly listen to Venezuela and the truth of the 21st century Bolivarian revolution\u201d.

Maduro has been fighting for his political life since January when a young opposition leader, Juan Guaid\u00f3, declared himself Venezuela\u2019s rightful president and received the backing of more than 50 governments, including the US and UK. More than four million Venezuelans have now fled their oil-rich but economically devastated nation, according to the UN\u2019s refugee agency, with at least 1 million people leaving since last November alone.",
