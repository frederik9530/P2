The Dow Jones dropped 800 points, or 3 percent, and many blamed the downturn on market uncertainty caused by Trump\u2019s trade wars. But the president unsurprisingly blamed the Federal Reserve for Wall Street\u2019s woes. Representative Steve King is once again facing calls for his resignation from democratic and republican lawmakers after he defended his stance on abortion by claiming that rape and incest had helped fuel population growth. Trump suggested on Twitter that China should \u201chumanely\u201d address the Hong Kong protestors prior to resuming trade talks with the US. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said the Hong Kong protests were an \u201cinternal matter,\u201d echoing a talking point from China\u2019s own government. Ken Cucinnelli is still facing widespread condemnation for saying the poem at the Statue of Liberty refers to \u201cpeople coming from Europe, where they had class-based societies.\u201d Beto O\u2019Rourke said the comment proved that Trump officials \u201cthink the Statue of Liberty only applies to white people.\u201d Lawmakers have subpoenaed the owner of 8chan, the far-right website linked to white supremacist extremist violence. Donald Trump is linking US-China trade talks with the Hong Kong protests on Twitter, suggesting that if the China government wants to work out a deal it has to \u201chumanely\u201d work with the protestors. Whereas investors and foreign leaders have blamed uncertainty around trade negotiations between the US and China is triggering economic volatility around the world, Trump has insisted that negotiations between himself and China\u2019s Xi Jinping are going well and that Jerome Powell, the chairman of the Fed chairman that Trump nominated in 2017, is to blame. A video of Elizabeth Warren running at a town hall event in New Hampshire this afternoon has inspired journalists and comedians alike. Democratic senators are asking Donald Trump to withdraw his $5 billion request for border wall funding and instead use the money on initiatives to stop gun violence. From Reuters: In a letter, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and Senator Patrick Leahy informed Trump that he does not have enough support in Congress for his wall funding request to be included in the federal budget for fiscal year 2020, which begins on Oct. 1. \u201cInstead, we urge you to support spending funds you have requested for the border wall, on other pressing needs such as proven initiatives that will address the threats of gun violence and white supremacist extremism in America,\u201d wrote Schumer and Leahy, who is the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee that oversees government outlays. The request, which was expected, surfaced as Democrats in the Senate and House of Representatives are trying to pressure Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell to call the Senate back early from its August recess and allow votes on universal background check legislation that passed the House in February. Lawmakers have subpoenaed the owner of 8chan, the far-right website linked to the man suspected of killing 22 people in El Paso, Texas. \u201cAt least three acts of deadly white supremacist extremist violence have been linked to 8chan in the last six months. We have questions on what is being done to counter this trend so we can be sure it is being properly addressed,\u201d said Mississippi congressman Bennie Thompson, the democratic leader of the House homeland security committee, and Alabama congressman Mike Rogers, the committee\u2019s highest-ranking republican, in a joint statement. The committee is asking 8chan owner Jim Watkins to testify at a deposition in September. More Democratic presidential candidates, including Amy Klobuchar, Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris, have condemned representative Steve King\u2019s comments on rape and are urging people to donate to his opponent JD Scholten, who is looking to unseat King in next year\u2019s elections. That\u2019s it from me today. My West Coast colleague Maanvi Singh will be taking over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: US stocks tumbled as signs increased that the economy may be headed for a recession. The Dow Jones dropped 800 points, or 3 percent, and many blamed the downturn on market uncertainty caused by Trump\u2019s trade wars. But the president unsurprisingly blamed the Federal Reserve for Wall Street\u2019s woes. Representative Steve King is once again facing calls for his resignation after he defended his stance on abortion by claiming that rape and incest had helped fuel population growth. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said the Hong Kong protests were an \u201cinternal matter,\u201d echoing a talking point from China\u2019s own government. More lawmakers from both parties have put out statements expressing support for the pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong and sternly warning China against any violent crackdown of the demonstrations. Ken Cucinnelli is still facing widespread condemnation for saying the poem at the Statue of Liberty refers to \u201cpeople coming from Europe, where they had class-based societies.\u201d Beto O\u2019Rourke said the comment proved that Trump officials \u201cthink the Statue of Liberty only applies to white people.\u201d Maanvi will be covering more fallout from the market dip and King\u2019s comments, so stay tuned. Representative Liz Cheney, the chairwoman of the House Republican Conference, has called for Representative Steve King to resign over his abortion comments. Cheney previously suggested King should resign after he said in an interview with the New York Times, \u201cwhite nationalist, white supremacist, western civilization \u2013 how did that language become offensive?\u201d The Dow\u2019s 800-point drop is among the market\u2019s worst in history, but it is much less daunting when compared by percentages: And a Politico reporter noted that even economists seem to be having a hard time determining the implications of the inverted yield curve: As the Dow sank 800 points and signs increasingly pointed to an impending recession, the vice president said he would travel to Michigan next week to tout the \u201cgrowing\u201d economy: The Dow Jones suffered its worst percentage drop of the year, closing down 800 points or about 3 percent as signs intensified of a looming recession. While the hashtag #TrumpRecession trended on Twitter, the president himself directed his ire at a familiar target, the Federal Reserve. Republican Randy Feenstra, an Iowa state senator who has launched a primary challenge against Representative Steve King, has also condemned the congressman\u2019s comments about abortion. Feenstra is one of three Republicans challenging King for the Republican nomination, but the state senator has outraised all of his competitors \u2013 including the incumbent \u2013 with the support of the GOP establishment. Another House Democrat, Deb Haaland of New Mexico, has announced her support for launching an impeachment inquiry against Trump. \u201cThere is growing evidence of impeachable offenses and I believe we have a responsibility to defend our Constitution and our Democracy,\u201d Haaland said in a statement announcing her support. \u201cWe must move forward with an impeachment inquiry. The President is not above the law.\u201d The freshman congresswoman becomes the 122nd House Democrat, according to the Washington Post\u2019s count, to back an impeachment inquiry. Nancy Pelosi once again invoked the \u201cMoscow Mitch\u201d nickname for Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell while the House speaker was addressing a Democratic event in Springfield, Illinois. \u201cWe sent our legislation to the Senate,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cMoscow Mitch says that he is the \u2018grim reaper.\u2019 Imagine describing yourself as the \u2018grim reaper,\u2019 that he\u2019s going to bury all this legislation.\u201d McConnell has previously expressed anger at the \u201cMoscow Mitch\u201d nickname, which was created to criticize the Senate leader for blocking legislation aimed at targeting foreign election interference. \u201cI don\u2019t normally take the time to respond to critics in the media when they have no clue what they\u2019re talking about, but this modern-day McCarthyism is toxic and damaging because of the way it warps our entire public discourse,\u201d McConnell said in a floor speech last month. Several Democratic presidential candidates are arguing that Representative Steve King\u2019s comments on abortion underscore the urgent need to replace him in the House with Democratic congressional candidate J.D. Scholten. \u201cYou would think it would be pretty easy to come out against rape and incest. Then again, you\u2019d think it would be pretty easy to come out against white nationalism,\u201d Pete Buttigieg told CNN in the early voting state of Iowa, King\u2019s home state. \u201cThis is just one more example why there needs to be a sane representative in that district, and it\u2019s why I think J.D. Scholten will be an excellent public servant for that district.\u201d Some of Buttigieg\u2019s opponents made the same point over Twitter: JD Scholten, the Democrat running to replace Representative Steve King in the House, denounced the Republican\u2019s comments on abortion as \u201centirely unacceptable\u201d and \u201cdisrespectful to survivors\u201d. \u201cYet again, Steve King puts his selfish, hateful ideology above the needs of the people of Iowa\u2019s fourth district,\u201d Scholten said in a statement. \u201cHis comments are disrespectful to survivors and don\u2019t reflect Iowan values. We stand for bringing all people together and fighting for the positive change that we desperately need here in Iowa.\u201d Scholten recently announced he would once again attempt to unseat King after narrowly losing to the incumbent Republican last year. King\u2019s unexpectedly close race has also spurred fellow Republicans to launch primary challenges against him. Representative Steve King has previously attracted controversy for comments about pregnancy resulting from rape or incest. During his re-election campaign in 2012, King was asked by a reporter about Medicaid covering abortion for victims of statutory rape or incest. \u201cWell,\u201d King told the reporter, \u201cI just haven\u2019t heard of that being a circumstance that\u2019s been brought to me in any personal way, and I\u2019d be open to discussion about that subject matter.\u201d That remark prompted outcry and comparisons to then-Representative Todd Akin, who was denounced for saying that pregnancy from rape was \u201creally rare.\u201d \u201cIf it\u2019s a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut the whole thing down,\u201d Akin said. But King later denied claims that he had been making a similar argument. \u201cI never said, nor do I believe, a woman, including minors, cannot get pregnant from rape, statutory rape or incest,\u201d King said in a later statement. Democratic presidential candidates and lawmakers are expressing outrage about Representative Steve King\u2019s comments that rape and incest have helped fuel population growth. The Iowa Republican told a local conservative group that he opposed abortion even in cases of rape or incest because, \u201cWhat if we went back through all the family trees and just pulled out anyone who was a product of rape or incest? Would there be any population of the world left if we did that?\u201d Democratic presidential candidate Kirsten Gillibrand said the Iowa congressman should resign over the comments: One of her opponents, Beto O\u2019Rourke, called on his supporters to donate to the campaign of King\u2019s Democratic rival: And Democratic Senator Brian Schatz noted that Republican presidential candidates in 2016 welcomed King\u2019s support: Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez cited Ken Cuccinelli\u2019s comments about the Statue of Liberty to urge her Twitter followers to register to vote. The progressive congresswoman is only the latest Democrat to condemn Cuccinelli\u2019s remarks. The acting director of US Citizenship and Immigration Services told CNN last night that the poem at the State of Liberty refers to \u201cpeople coming from Europe, where they had class-based societies.\u201d Democratic presidential candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke said Cuccinelli\u2019s comment proved that Trump officials \u201cthink the Statue of Liberty only applies to white people.\u201d Republican Representative Steve King has once again reinforced his reputation for defending his controversial positions with even more controversial comments. Explaining his opposition to abortion even in cases of rape or incest, the Iowa Republican told a local conservative group, \u201cWhat if we went back through all the family trees and just pulled out anyone who was a product of rape or incest? Would there be any population of the world left if we did that?\u201d King added, \u201cConsidering all the wars and all the rapes and pillages that happened throughout all these different nations, I know that I can\u2019t say that I was not a part of a product of that.\u201d The nine-term congressman was stripped of his committee assignments earlier this year after he told the New York Times that he didn\u2019t understand how terms like \u201cwhite nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization\u201d had \u201cbecome offensive.\u201d In the same appearance where he made his abortion comments, King claimed the coverage of his racist comments was just of a media plot to oust him from Congress. \u201cPeople think it was an organic media feeding frenzy, but no, it was orchestrated from the beginning,\u201d he said. \u201cThey had told me, heads up before Christmas, they\u2019re going to try to drive you out of office and get you to resign. Within 24 hours, you had people saying \u2018resign, resign, resign.\u2019 Why? Because the New York Times misquoted me?\u201d Despite the backlash over those comments, King is still running for re-election next year and has already attracted challenges from Democrats and fellow Republicans. Another Republican senator, Ben Sasse of Nebraska, put out a statement expressing support for the Hong Kong protesters and criticizing the Chinese government. \u201cAmerica has always stood alongside freedom-seekers because \u2060\u2013 unlike the corrupt Communist elites in Beijing \u2013 we believe in universal human dignity,\u201d Sasse said. He urged the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, to \u201cthink very carefully about the fallout of violating Hong Kong\u2019s internationally recognized autonomy.\u201d \u201cAmerica must stand with the protesters,\u201d Sasse concluded. \u201cThe world is watching.\u201d More lawmakers from both parties are expressing support for the pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. The leading Democrat and Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee have just issued a statement warning that any effort by the Chinese government to force an end to the demonstrations \u201cwould be met with universal condemnation and swift consequences.\u201d \u201cThe House Foreign Affairs Committee has called upon Beijing to cease encroaching on Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy \u2014 it is Beijing\u2019s actions that are at the root of the frustration among the people of Hong Kong,\u201d Democrat Eliot Engel and Republican Michael McCaul said. \u201cNo foreign powers are fomenting this dissent. It is the result of Beijing\u2019s successive violations of their commitment to honor the will of the people of Hong Kong. \u201cWe have deep respect for the brave efforts of Hong Kong people from every walk of life who have demonstrated their clear desire for freedom, democracy, and the rule of law.\u201d The US state department has issued a travel advisory for Hong Kong, warning Americans there to \u201c[e]xercise increased caution ... due to civil unrest\u201d. \u201cSince June 2019, several large scale and smaller political demonstrations have taken place in various areas of Hong Kong, including at Hong Kong International Airport. Most have been peaceful, but some have turned confrontational or resulted in violent clashes,\u201d the department said in a notice posted to its website. \u201cPolice have used a variety of crowd control measures, including the deployment of teargas. The protests and confrontations have spilled over into neighborhoods other than those where the police have permitted marches or rallies. These demonstrations, which can take place with little or no notice, are likely to continue.\u201d Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said the Hong Kong protests were an \u201cinternal matter,\u201d echoing a talking point from the Chinese government. Ken Cuccinelli, the acting director of US Citizenship and Immigration Services, was slammed for saying the poem at the Statue of Liberty refers to \u201cpeople coming from Europe, where they had class-based societies.\u201d Crtics argued he was saying the American dream should only be made available to white people. US stocks have tumbled as signs intensify that the economy may be headed toward a recession. Former Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams said she would consider becoming the vice-president of \u201cany nominee.\u201d The blog is keeping its eye on gun-control negotiations and the latest from Hong Kong, so stay tuned. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross appeared to reiterate a talking point from the Chinese government when he was asked about the Hong Kong protests. Appearing on CNBC, Ross was pressed on whether the US had relinquished its role as a supporter of democracies around the world. \u201cWhat would we do, invade Hong Kong?\u201d Ross asked with a laugh. \u201cThe president has made it clear that he is watching very carefully what\u2019s happening,\u201d Ross added. Trump said yesterday that the protests were a \u201cvery tough situation\u201d but refrained from criticizing China over the demonstration. \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019ll work out,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI hope it works out for everybody, including China.\u201d Ross went on to tell CNBC, \u201cHe talked about the possibility of troop build-up and it\u2019s not that we are not watching it, it\u2019s a question of what role is there for the US in that matter. This is an internal matter.\u201d The \u201cinternal matter\u201d line was echoed in a statement yesterday from China\u2019s Foreign Ministry. \u201cWe solemnly remind you this plain truth: Hong Kong affairs are entirely China\u2019s internal affairs, and you are neither entitled nor qualified to wantonly comment on them,\u201d the ministry said. \u201cMind your own business and stay out of Hong Kong affairs.\u201d The Dow Jones is currently down more than 500 points, erasing all of yesterday\u2019s gains, as signs intensify that the US economy could be headed toward a recession. The bond yield curve has inverted, signaling investors\u2019 uncertainty about the country\u2019s economic future. An inverted yield curve has preceded every recession for the past five decades, the Washington Post notes, and is thus considered one of the more reliable signs of an economic downturn. The market tumble comes one day after stocks jumped with the news that the Trump administration was delaying some of its tariffs on Chinese imports. But the good news was clearly short-lived, which the president unsurprisingly appears to be blaming on the Federal Reserve: Nancy Pelosi warned in a statement that the Democratic-controlled House would reject any US-UK trade deal if Brexit threatened the Good Friday peace agreement between Ireland and Northern Ireland. Our colleague Julian Borger reports: Pelosi was restating the entrenched position of congressional Democrats and many Republicans in the wake of remarks made by Donald Trump\u2019s national security adviser, John Bolton, during a visit to London this week. Bolton had said that Britain and the US could sign interim, partial free trade deals, one sector at a time, which would go through the a fast track legislative process, to help the UK cope economically if there is a no-deal Brexit on 31 October. In a statement on Wednesday, the House speaker, who commands a Democratic majority, warned the Trump administration would not be able to sidestep congressional approval. \u2018Whatever form it takes, Brexit cannot be allowed to imperil the Good Friday agreement, including the seamless border between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland, especially now, as the first generation born into the hope of Good Friday 21 years ago comes into adulthood.\u2019 Pelosi said. \u2018We cannot go back.\u2019 The spokesperson for Mike Pence is headed to the Pentagon after nearly two years as the vice president\u2019s press secretary: Trump appears to have backed off plans to commute the sentence of former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich amid complaints from the state\u2019s Republican lawmakers. CNN reports: Several Republican lawmakers called acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and White House counsel Pat Cipollone, [multiple] sources told CNN, and the Republican members of Illinois congressional delegation issued a joint statement opposing the move. At least two of them, Reps. Darin LaHood and Mike Bost, made their case directly to the President on Thursday night, urging him not to go forward. They laid out the litany of crimes Blagojevich committed while in office and argued it would send the wrong message to voters about corruption by public officials. ... LaHood -- a former federal and state prosecutor -- called Trump ... and laid out in detail the brazen charges against Blagojevich, including allegations he threatened to cancel millions in state dollars for a children\u2019s hospital if its CEO did not write him a $25,000 campaign check. Among the charges was that Blagojevich attempted to sell former President Barack Obama\u2019s Senate seat that he resigned in order to become president.And Trump was informed on the call that Blagojevich -- whom Trump knew from his role on \u2018Celebrity Apprentice\u2019 -- didn\u2019t offer any remorse for his crimes, sources said. Democratic presidential candidate Steve Bullock is accusing one of his opponents, billionaire activist Tom Steyer, of buying his way on to the fall debate stage. Steyer announced yesterday that he has received contributions from more than 130,000 unique donors, crossing the threshold outlined by the Democratic National Committee. He is also just one qualifying poll away from making the fall debate stage. But Bullock argued Steyer\u2019s rise was only made possible by his aggressive ad spending, underscoring the unfairness of the DNC\u2019s debate qualifications. \u201cA billionaire literally just spent $10 million to qualify for the next debate stage,\u201d the Montana governor said in a video posted to Twitter. \u201cIf we think as Democrats that spending $10 million to get 130,000 donors is grassroots support, we\u2019re missing something.\u201d Steyer\u2019s campaign manager pushed back against Bullock\u2019s complaint, claiming that most of his donations did not come from advertising: Bernie Sanders released a teaser video of his conversation with Cardi B, who recently endorsed his presidential bid. The rapper said in an Instagram post that she asked the Vermont senator about raising the minimum wage. Sanders tweeted that their full conversation, filmed at a nail bar in Detroit, would be available tomorrow: An ally of Mike Pompeo has been telling Republican donors to hold off on contributing to Senate candidates in Kansas until the secretary of state decides whether to jump into the race. Bloomberg News reports: The top U.S. diplomat and former CIA director, who served as a congressman in Kansas\u2019s 4th district from 2011-2017, has until June to enter the race. Pompeo has given mixed signals about his intentions. In a July interview with David Rubenstein at the Economic Club of Washington, he said: \u2018It\u2019s off the table. As a practical matter, I\u2019m going to serve as secretary of state every day that I get the chance to do so.\u2019 But asked earlier in the month about running for the Senate, Pompeo told KCMO Radio -- which broadcasts in Kansas -- that \u2018I always need to be open to the possibility that something will change and my path in life will change too.\u2019 ... As he weighs his decision, Pompeo has been courted by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and other top Republican leaders who are anxious that a Democratic candidate could claim the seat that will open with fellow Republican Pat Roberts\u2019s retirement. Ken Cuccinelli, the acting director of US Citizenship and Immigration Services, made the mistake of saying the quiet part out loud about the Trump administration\u2019s new \u201cpublic charge rule\u201d. The policy would penalize green-card applicants who use public benefits, leading to accusations from critics that it discriminates against lower-income immigrant families. Cuccinelli has repeatedly been pressed on whether such a rule files in the face of the poem at the Statue of Liberty \u2013 which reads, in part: \u201cGive me your tired, your poor / Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.\u201d \u201cWell, of course, that poem was referring back to people coming from Europe, where they had class-based societies, where people were considered wretched if they weren\u2019t in the right class,\u201d Cuccinelli told CNN host Erin Burnett. \u201cAnd it was written one year after the first federal public charge rule was written.\u201d Critics of the policy jumped on the comment, arguing that it showed how the Trump administration believes the American dream should only be available to white people. From Democratic presidential candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke: From a New York Times editorial board member: From a writer for GQ magazine: Democratic presidential candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke will return to the campaign trail tomorrow after spending nearly two weeks in his hometown of El Paso as it mourns the 22 people lost in a recent mass shooting. He will deliver a speech in El Paso tomorrow morning and then resume his campaign stops across the country, his campaign said in a statement. \u201c[H]is remarks will outline the path forward for his presidential campaign and for the future of the country,\u201d the statement added. But that path forward appears very uncertain. Despite narrowly losing to Republican Senator Ted Cruz in the longtime Republican state of Texas last year, O\u2019Rourke\u2019s presidential campaign seems to have stalled. He has been largely unable to attract more than 3 percent of the vote in recent national polls and has faced calls to return to Texas and launch another Senate bid, including from the editorial board of the Houston Chronicle. But O\u2019Rourke\u2019s allies note that he has already qualified for the fall debates, expressing hope that he will pick up momentum once other candidates drop off. Senator Martha McSally, a Republican of Arizona, has drafted a bill that would make domestic terrorism a federal crime in the wake of the mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton. The legislation would close a legal loophole that has left federal authorities unable to charge suspects specifically with domestic terrorism. Instead, suspects from tragedies like El Paso and Dayton have faced charges of weapons possessions or hate crimes. \u201cFor too long we have allowed those who commit heinous acts of domestic terrorism to be charged with related crimes that don\u2019t portray the full scope of their hateful actions,\u201d McSally said upon releasing the draft bill. \u201cThat stops with my bill. The bill I am introducing will give federal law enforcement the tools they have asked for so that they can punish criminals to the fullest extent of the law.\u201d The bill also comes as Republicans have sent mixed messages about what gun legislation, if any, they might pursue after the latest mass shootings. Trump has repeatedly said that Mitch McConnell is supportive of expanding background checks, but the Senate majority leader himself has avoided committing to any specific action. Good morning, live blog readers! Stacey Abrams can\u2019t stop making news. The former Democratic gubernatorial candidate announced yesterday that she would not launch a White House bid, instead focusing on elevating her voting rights initiative to a national level. But many reporters noted that the Georgia Democrat would still likely be atop many presidential candidates\u2019 lists of potential running mates. Abrams has now thrown gasoline on that fire of speculation by telling the New York Times that she would be open to becoming vice-president. \u201cI would be honored to be considered by any nominee,\u201d Abrams told the Times last night. After her widely lauded response to Donald Trump\u2019s State of the Union address earlier this year, many Democrats believe Abrams has the political skill and the star power to take back the White House \u2060\u2013 and potentially turn her home state of Georgia, a longtime Republican stronghold, into a blue dot on the 2020 electoral map. Here\u2019s what else the blog is keeping its eye on: Trump has no events on his public schedule, but his Twitter feed has been noticeably quiet this morning after a very active Tuesday. House speaker Nancy Pelosi will keynote a brunch for the Illinois Democratic County Chairs\u2019 Association this morning. The US rapper A$AP Rocky has just been found guilty of assault in Sweden. The blog will have more on all of that soon, so stay tuned.",

      "bodyText": "Liverpool Adri\u00e1n Shootout hero despite giving away a second-half penalty. Saved well from Kovacic, Abraham and Mount. 7 Joe Gomez Started well but struggled as Pulisic\u2019s influence grew. Switched to left-back in extra-time. 6 Jo\u00ebl Matip Remarkably sloppy in possession and did not look comfortable against Giroud throughout. 5 Virgil van Dijk Not at his dominant best and was unusually caught out of position on a few occasions. 6 Andy Robertson Made an impressive interception when Pedro was on his way through but did not offer much offensively. 6 Jordan Henderson Was initially able to maraud forward and, after a quiet period, his influence grew again. Booked. 6 Fabinho Unable to dictate play in first half but improved and started the move that led to his team\u2019s first goal. 6 James Milner His usual combative self but one of his quieter games and he was replaced in the second half. 5 Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain First competitive start since April 2018 but was anonymous and Klopp took him off at half-time. 5 Mohamed Salah Shot weakly with outside of foot when in a good position. Worked hard defensively. 7 Sadio Man\u00e9 Grew in importance after moving out to the left. Alert to score his first goal and the second was sublime. 8 Substitutes: Roberto Firmino 8 (for Oxlade-Chamberlain, h-t) Completely transformed Liverpool when he came on and set up both goals. Georginio Wijnaldum 6 (for Milner 64) Unable to make a huge difference after coming on for Milner.; Trent Alexander-Arnold 6 (for Robertson 90) Pushed forward and was left exposed against Mount at times. Booked.; Divock Origi 6 (for Man\u00e9 103) Tried to cut inside from the left on a few occasions but did not trouble Azpilicueta. Chelsea Kepa Arrizabalaga Astonishing double save when denying Salah and Van Dijk. Nearly kept out two penalties. 7 C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta Not troubled in the first half but found it tougher against Man\u00e9. Rarely ventured forward. Booked. 6 Andreas Christensen Strong in the air and there were signs that his partnership with Zouma can be an effective one. 6 Kurt Zouma Complemented Christensen and positioned well. Dangerous on set pieces going forward. 7 Emerson Palmieri Held his own against Salah and was able to support Pulisic pushing forward at times. 6 Jorginho Reassured with crisp passing and much more comfortable than at Old Trafford. Scored penalty in normal time. 7 N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 A superb, bustling presence in midfield, he set the tone for Chelsea. Lovely nutmeg on Milner. 8 Mateo Kovacic Another player who benefited from having Kant\u00e9 next to him and nearly scored in the first half. 6 Pedro Started deep against Robertson but grew in stature and hit the bar. Lively throughout. 7 Olivier Giroud Good movement up front and created several chances. Decisive finish for the goal. 7 Christian Pulisic Set up Giroud\u2019s goal superbly by drifting inside and supplying a perfect, defence-splitting pass. 7 Substitutes: Tammy Abraham 6 (for Giroud 74) Missed the decisive penalty but impressed when he came on and won the spot kick for the equaliser; Mason Mount 7 (for Pulisic, 74) Thought he had scored but was deemed offside. Tested Adri\u00e1n from outside area; Fikayo Tomori 6 (for Christensen, 86) Looked comfortable after coming on at centre-back for Christensen; Ross Barkley 6 (for Kovacic 101) Entered the fray in extra time and did well against tiring opponents.",

Reducing salt is one of the most cost-effective measures to protect health.\u201d</p> <p>Action on Salt, which is based at QMUL, found that half of products were higher in salt than their average salt targets and 17% had more salt than their maximum target.<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/salt-reduction-targets-for-2017\"> In 2014, PHE issued issued guideline salt targets</a> for more than 80 categories of food, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/dec/19/failure-to-reduce-nations-salt-intake-has-killed-thousands-say-activists\">the aim that they be met by 2017.</a></p> <p>The pressure group said its research showed reformulation was possible, given significant variations within product categories. For example, Gosh! Mediterranean falafel with chickpea and parsley had 3.5 times more salt per 100g than Cauldron Middle Eastern falafels.

Lambasting the efforts of the government and its public health body, Action on Salt said its findings demonstrate the need for immediate, compulsory, front-of-pack, nutritional labelling on all picnic savouries. Graham MacGregor, professor of cardiovascular medicine at Queen Mary University of London (QMUL) and chair of Action on Salt, said: \u201cDue to inaction by the Department of Health and Social Care, and Public Health England (PHE), in enforcing the 2017 salt reduction targets, the public are still eating more salt than recommended, which is leading to thousands dying or suffering from entirely unnecessary strokes and heart disease. Reducing salt is one of the most cost-effective measures to protect health.\u201d Action on Salt, which is based at QMUL, found that half of products were higher in salt than their average salt targets and 17% had more salt than their maximum target. In 2014, PHE issued issued guideline salt targets for more than 80 categories of food, with the aim that they be met by 2017. The pressure group said its research showed reformulation was possible, given significant variations within product categories. For example, Gosh! Mediterranean falafel with chickpea and parsley had 3.5 times more salt per 100g than Cauldron Middle Eastern falafels. A Ginsters large sausage roll had twice as much salt per 100g than Aldi Everyday Essentials eight sausage rolls. When it came to saturated fat, Morrisons cheese and onion slices contained 17.7g per portion, almost a woman\u2019s recommended daily limit of saturated fat. Asda Extra Special maple-cured smoked bacon quiche Lorraine weighed in at 11g of saturated fat per 100g and at 14g per portion \u2013 almost as much as in five McDonald\u2019s hamburgers. Action in Salt said that while vegetarian products are often lower in saturated fat, in many cases their \u201chealth halo\u201d is concealing lots of salt. MacGregor said it was not good enough that there is no active salt reduction strategy. \u201cThe time has come for the secretary of state for health to resuscitate the UK\u2019s salt reduction programme, helping us to, once again, be world-leading rather than trailing behind,\u201d he said. Prof Louis Levy, head of nutrition science at PHE, said: \u201cVoluntary action by industry on salt reduction has helped reduce the nation\u2019s salt intake by 11%, to 8g per day but our review last December shows a mixed bag across products, with only just over half of salt reduction targets met. \u201cWe all have a role to play in eating a healthier diet, and it is clear that, with the right leadership from industry, further salt reduction in foods is still possible\u201d. Both Ginsters and Aldi said their products included nutritional information so customers could make informed choices.",

      "body": "<p>The first all-English Uefa Super Cup final served a dual purpose for Frank Lampard. Victory, he had considered beforehand, would not only etch another trophy into Chelsea\u2019s history but instil in his young team the confidence that they can compete at Liverpool\u2019s level this season.

But Liverpool write their own scripts in Istanbul and there was a sense of inevitability as Tammy Abraham stepped forward to take the final spot-kick of an otherwise flawless penalty shootout. Adri\u00e1n, nine days into his Liverpool career, saved with his legs and the trophy was heading for Anfield. It will help Chelsea\u2019s morale to dwell on their performance and not the outcome.

His arrival has been complicated by a transfer ban, the loss of Eden Hazard plus an experienced central defender in David Luiz, and the injuries that impacted on his first Premier League contest.

      "bodyText": "The first all-English Uefa Super Cup final served a dual purpose for Frank Lampard. Victory, he had considered beforehand, would not only etch another trophy into Chelsea\u2019s history but instil in his young team the confidence that they can compete at Liverpool\u2019s level this season. There would be no trophy, only more pain for Lampard in a Super Cup final, but his team left Istanbul in the knowledge they can and will compete. After the misery of Old Trafford on Sunday and more distant memories of defeats as a player in the Super Cup games of 2012 and 2013 Lampard was desperate to launch his Chelsea reign with European silverware. But Liverpool write their own scripts in Istanbul and there was a sense of inevitability as Tammy Abraham stepped forward to take the final spot-kick of an otherwise flawless penalty shootout. Adri\u00e1n, nine days into his Liverpool career, saved with his legs and the trophy was heading for Anfield. It will help Chelsea\u2019s morale to dwell on their performance and not the outcome. They will be justified in doing so as it could so easily have been their name written on to this trophy. Lampard is a manager in need of a break. His arrival has been complicated by a transfer ban, the loss of Eden Hazard plus an experienced central defender in David Luiz, and the injuries that impacted on his first Premier League contest. His resources still run deeper than most, however, and he was able to call quality of the calibre of N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 and the \u00a358m Christian Pulisic into his starting lineup for the first time. Like a manager who basks in the impact of a substitute, Lampard could take immense satisfaction from the contribution of all three changes from Sunday\u2019s team. The third, Olivier Giroud, led the line impressively and scored before making way for Abraham. There was greater solidity and threat from the Europa League winners throughout, although a failure to capitalise on clear-cut chances remains a recurring problem. Abraham, Giroud and Kurt Zouma missed good openings while Liverpool\u2019s replacement goalkeeper saved well from the England under-21 striker and fellow substitute Mason Mount. The number of opportunities created against the team with the best defensive record in the Premier League last season was another reason for optimism at Stamford Bridge.

J\u00fcrgen Klopp was trying to keep up and Liverpool\u2019s only problem now is where to accommodate the Super Cup in their already congested trophy room. This was the fourth time they have won this competition, putting them level with Real Madrid and one behind Barcelona and Milan. \u2018European football royalty\u2019 to use the words of the public announcer.</p> \n<p>True, the six-time European Cup winners might not value their latest trophy with the affection they reserve for the one Jordan Henderson lifted in Madrid 74 days earlier. All the same Klopp and his players can still relish their latest trip to Istanbul, the scene of their 2005 Champions League win, and the high drama of the penalty shoot-out.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/14/liverpool-chelsea-uefa-super-cup-player-ratings\">Liverpool 2-2 Chelsea (5-4 on pens): Uefa Super Cup player ratings | Marcus Christenson</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Roberto Firmino, Fabinho, Divock Origi, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Mohamed Salah all scored from 12 yards for Liverpool. Jorginho, Ross Barkley, Mason Mount and Emerson did the same for Chelsea but Tammy Abraham\u2019s effort came back off Adri\u00e1n\u2019s outstretched boot and the goalkeeper, signed last Monday and deputising for the injured Alisson, suddenly had his new teammates \u2013 and, typically, Klopp \u2013 sprinting in his direction. Everyone but Fabinho, who had gone down with cramp and could barely walk, let alone run, at the end of an exhausting night.</p> \n<p>In the circumstances it was extraordinary that Fabinho felt capable of taking one of Liverpool\u2019s penalties. He placed it to Kepa Arrizabalaga\u2019s left whereas Liverpool\u2019s other four penalty-takers all went the other way and, agonisingly for Chelsea, their goalkeeper got his hand to the ones from Origi and Alexander-Arnold without stopping the ball from going inside the post. Arrizabalaga had produced a spectacular double save, at 1-1, to deny Salah and turn away Virgil van Dijk\u2019s follow-up effort, via bar and post, but the Spaniard will not enjoy watching the penalty shootout again.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2019/aug/14/liverpool-v-chelsea-uefa-super-cup-2019-live\">Liverpool beat Chelsea on penalties to win the Uefa Super Cup 2019 \u2013 as it happened</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>For Chelsea it was a cruel way to end the night and, having suffered the ordeal of a 4-0 drubbing against Manchester United on Sunday, their new manager, Frank Lampard, must be getting heartily sick of congratulating his team for playing so well when they have ended up with nothing. Olivier Giroud had given them a first-half lead and, when Sadio Man\u00e9\u2019s two goals turned the game upside down, the second coming in the 96th minute, Chelsea\u2019s players refused to be cowed. Jorginho\u2019s equaliser came from the penalty spot and, ultimately, it was just a pity for Abraham that he could not emulate the Brazilian\u2019s technique.</p> \n<p>Chelsea had also hit the woodwork from a Pedro shot and, twice, an offside flag deprived them other goals. Giroud was a difficult opponent for Jo\u00ebl Matip and Van Dijk but it was N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9\u2019s return to the starting line-up that really improved Chelsea\u2019s team. Pedro was heavily involved and Mount, one of their substitutes, was another key performer once he had taken over from Christian Pulisic, who was full of elegant touches on his first start for the club.</p> \n<p>Liverpool, in response, will feel they had enough chances to have won the game in normal time. But then again, so could Chelsea. It was one of those nights, full of attacking football, and, by the end, it was difficult to keep count of the number of scoring opportunities for both sides. Abraham, for one, will not just remember Adrian\u2019s penalty save but also the moment when Chelsea\u2019s substitute striker angled a shot wide, inside the six-yard area, in the second period of extra time.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"494672f239806b38c5af5798fa8f94698cd36e33\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/494672f239806b38c5af5798fa8f94698cd36e33/0_182_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jordan Henderson lifts the trophy surrounded by delighted teammates\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jordan Henderson lifts the trophy surrounded by delighted teammates.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthew Ashton - AMA/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Chelsea\u2019s confidence certainly did not seem to have been knocked by what happened at Old Trafford at the weekend. The truth is they had played stylishly for long spells of that match and, again, they seemed intent on showing they were an accomplished side.

      "bodyText": "It was 12.43am local time when the teams were finally prised apart. The players in red had set off on their victory run, all heading to the newest member of their group. J\u00fcrgen Klopp was trying to keep up and Liverpool\u2019s only problem now is where to accommodate the Super Cup in their already congested trophy room. This was the fourth time they have won this competition, putting them level with Real Madrid and one behind Barcelona and Milan. \u2018European football royalty\u2019 to use the words of the public announcer. True, the six-time European Cup winners might not value their latest trophy with the affection they reserve for the one Jordan Henderson lifted in Madrid 74 days earlier. All the same Klopp and his players can still relish their latest trip to Istanbul, the scene of their 2005 Champions League win, and the high drama of the penalty shoot-out. Roberto Firmino, Fabinho, Divock Origi, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Mohamed Salah all scored from 12 yards for Liverpool. Jorginho, Ross Barkley, Mason Mount and Emerson did the same for Chelsea but Tammy Abraham\u2019s effort came back off Adri\u00e1n\u2019s outstretched boot and the goalkeeper, signed last Monday and deputising for the injured Alisson, suddenly had his new teammates \u2013 and, typically, Klopp \u2013 sprinting in his direction. Everyone but Fabinho, who had gone down with cramp and could barely walk, let alone run, at the end of an exhausting night. In the circumstances it was extraordinary that Fabinho felt capable of taking one of Liverpool\u2019s penalties. He placed it to Kepa Arrizabalaga\u2019s left whereas Liverpool\u2019s other four penalty-takers all went the other way and, agonisingly for Chelsea, their goalkeeper got his hand to the ones from Origi and Alexander-Arnold without stopping the ball from going inside the post. Arrizabalaga had produced a spectacular double save, at 1-1, to deny Salah and turn away Virgil van Dijk\u2019s follow-up effort, via bar and post, but the Spaniard will not enjoy watching the penalty shootout again. For Chelsea it was a cruel way to end the night and, having suffered the ordeal of a 4-0 drubbing against Manchester United on Sunday, their new manager, Frank Lampard, must be getting heartily sick of congratulating his team for playing so well when they have ended up with nothing. Olivier Giroud had given them a first-half lead and, when Sadio Man\u00e9\u2019s two goals turned the game upside down, the second coming in the 96th minute, Chelsea\u2019s players refused to be cowed. Jorginho\u2019s equaliser came from the penalty spot and, ultimately, it was just a pity for Abraham that he could not emulate the Brazilian\u2019s technique. Chelsea had also hit the woodwork from a Pedro shot and, twice, an offside flag deprived them other goals. Giroud was a difficult opponent for Jo\u00ebl Matip and Van Dijk but it was N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9\u2019s return to the starting line-up that really improved Chelsea\u2019s team. Pedro was heavily involved and Mount, one of their substitutes, was another key performer once he had taken over from Christian Pulisic, who was full of elegant touches on his first start for the club. Liverpool, in response, will feel they had enough chances to have won the game in normal time. But then again, so could Chelsea. It was one of those nights, full of attacking football, and, by the end, it was difficult to keep count of the number of scoring opportunities for both sides. Abraham, for one, will not just remember Adrian\u2019s penalty save but also the moment when Chelsea\u2019s substitute striker angled a shot wide, inside the six-yard area, in the second period of extra time. Chelsea\u2019s confidence certainly did not seem to have been knocked by what happened at Old Trafford at the weekend. The truth is they had played stylishly for long spells of that match and, again, they seemed intent on showing they were an accomplished side. Even in defeat they managed it. Ultimately, though, they might have been fortunate the game even reached penalties. Liverpool\u2019s players could feel aggrieved that the referee, St\u00e9phanie Frappart, gave Chelsea a penalty for Adri\u00e1n\u2019s alleged foul on Abraham. The officials in charge of the VAR monitors decided against over-ruling her and it was the same earlier in the match when a handball from Andreas Christensen went unpunished inside the penalty area. Christensen had his arms raised when he blocked Man\u00e9\u2019s overhead kick and under the new rules \u2013 a point Uefa emphasised in a media briefing on the eve of this match \u2013 it should have resulted in a penalty. Klopp had begun the night with Man\u00e9 in a central role and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain making his first competitive start since rupturing his knee ligaments in a Champions League tie against AS Roma two seasons ago. It had been 477 days and it was unfortunate for him, perhaps, that he was asked to fill a left-sided role to which he was unaccustomed. Nobody should have been too surprised, with Liverpool losing 1-0, when Firmino replaced him at half-time and Man\u00e9 switched to the left. Chelsea had taken the lead in the 36th minute when Pulisic and the ubiquitous Kant\u00e9 combined to leave Giroud with the chance to aim his shot beyond Adri\u00e1n. Liverpool had to improve in the second half and, within three minutes, they had found an equaliser. Salah\u2019s cross from the right struck Mateo Kovacic on the back and that left Firmino in a chase with Arrizabalaga, rushing from his goalline, to reach the bouncing ball first. Firmino got there a split-second earlier than the goalkeeper, touching the ball to his right. Kepa was now stranded and Man\u00e9, following up, scored into an exposed net.

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s Daniel Taylor\u2019s match report. But it\u2019s Jordan Henderson who lifts the Super Cup for Liverpool. Another trophy for them. They\u2019re making a habit out of it under Jurgen Klopp. That\u2019s all from me tonight. Thanks for reading and emailing. Bye! Frank Lampard looks miffed. He doesn\u2019t like losing. Still, he probably won\u2019t emulate Jose Mourinho, who sent Romelu Lukaku on loan to Everton after the Belgian missed the crucial penalty against Bayern Munich in the 2013 Super Cup, and banish Tammy Abraham after his miss. This was an improvement from Chelsea after their defeat to Manchester United. Lampard can feel optimistic before Sunday\u2019s home game against Leicester. Adrian speaks! \u201cWelcome to Liverpool. It was a crazy week. I am happy for the team. I am happy to get a trophy. I am really happy for the fans. It was a long game but in the end it was a great finish for us. To be fair I tried to stop when I saw him. The striker is so intelligent. I touched him with the penalty but he was looking for that. I told the referee I tried to stop but it doesn\u2019t matter. We got the title and have to enjoy tonight.\u201d Jordan Henderson speaks! \u201cIt\u2019s humid. You can\u2019t really tell on the telly. It was a tough game. Chelsea are a good side.\u201d PENALTIES: Liverpool 5-4 Chelsea*: Tammy Abraham takes a slow, nervous run-up and sends a soft penalty down the middle. Adrian saves with a trailing leg and Liverpool\u2019s players rush to mob their new goalkeeper! PENALTIES: Liverpool* 5-4 Chelsea: Salah sends Kepa the wrong way. Abraham has to score to keep Chelsea alive. PENALTIES: Liverpool 4-4 Chelsea*: Emerson drills his effort down the middle and is grateful to see Adrian dive out the way. PENALTIES: Liverpool* 4-3 Chelsea: Kepa gets his hand to another penalty - and again he can\u2019t keep out Alexander-Arnold\u2019s low effort. PENALTIES: Liverpool 3-3 Chelsea*: Mount smashes it high into the right corner. PENALTIES: Liverpool* 3-2 Chelsea: Origi\u2019s tame penalty somehow squirms through Kepa\u2019s hands. PENALTIES: Liverpool 2-2 Chelsea*: Barkley smashes it high into the left corner. PENALTIES: Liverpool* 2-1 Chelsea: Fabinho, who had cramp, steps up and buries his penalty into the bottom left corner. PENALTIES: Liverpool 1-1 Chelsea*: Jorginho does his penalty again. PENALTIES: Liverpool* 1-0 Chelsea: Firmino sends Kepa the wrong way. We will have penalties. ET 29 min: Fabinho has cramp. ET 28 min: Adrian repels another long-ranger from Mount. Abraham is offside from the rebound. Mount\u2019s done well since coming on. ET 23 min: Mount stings Adrian\u2019s palms from the edge of the area after being teed up by Abraham. Then Pedro slides a shot inches wide from 20 yards. ET 21 min: BT Sport\u2019s Darren Fletcher wants you to know that it\u2019s past midnight in Istanbul. ET 18 min: Penalties please. ET 16 min: Chelsea get us underway again. And another look at that penalty would suggest that Abraham made the most of very little contact. Many people will be asking why VAR didn\u2019t change the decison. There\u2019s still no separating them. ET 14 min: What a miss from Tammy Abraham! Barkley slices Liverpool open, Pedro pulls the ball back and Abraham slashes wide from six yards out! ET 13 min: Divock Origi replaces Sadio Mane, Liverpool\u2019s two-goal forward. ET 11 min: Ross Barkley replaces Mateo Kovacic. By the way that foul was so Adrian. He was capable of some extremely hare-brained decisions at West Ham. Oh, that is sublime. Jorginho takes a casual run-up, sits Adrian down and rolls the ball into the left corner. Classic Jorginho. Chelsea are level. ET 9 min: Pedro forces a ball into the middle from the right, Abraham refuses to give it up and he knocks it past Adrian, who sends him sprawling with a rash and needless challenge! VAR checks it, but the decision stands. ET 8 min: Chelsea look to hit back, Abraham bustling behind the Liverpool defence, but Van Dijk leans into the striker and makes sure he can\u2019t push the ball past Adrian, who makes the save. Played onside by Kurt Zouma, Roberto Firmino breaks clear down the left. He waits for support, bides his time, picks the right moment and cuts the ball back to Sadio Mane, who opens up his body and sidefoots a brilliant rising finish past Kepa for his second of the night. This is a lovely goal. ET 2 min: Joe \u201cRoberto Carlos\u201d Gomez charges forward from left-back, cuts inside and sees a deflected shot saved by Kepa. ET 1 min: Liverpool get extra-time underway. They\u2019ve brought on Trent Alexander-Arnold for Andy Robertson. Joe Gomez is at left-back now. There will be extra-time. 90 min+1: There will be two added minutes. 90 min: A late corner for Chelsea. Mount swings it in and Zouma charges in to bounce a header over from close range. 88 min: Neither of these sides look ecstatic at the prospect of extra-time. 85 min: Henderson\u2019s booked for fouling Emerson. 84 min: Fikayo Tomori replaces Andreas Christensen. 83 min: Mason Mount spanks a low shot past Adrian and into the far corner, but he\u2019s denied by a late offside flag. Chelsea have had two goals disallowed now. 82 min: Kante scoots down the right and picks out Pedro, but the winger\u2019s shot is blocked by Van Dijk. Moments later Abraham breaks behind the Liverpool defence, but Gomez clears his cross. 81 min: Salah\u2019s free-kick is deflected over. The corner comes to nothing. 79 min: Azpilicueta concedes a free-kick 25 yards from goal after bumping Mane over. The right-back\u2019s booked. 75 min: A Liverpool corner on the right. It\u2019s sent in low by Henderson and reaches Matip. He tees up Salah, who aims for the bottom left corner and smashes a low shot through the crowd. It takes a deflection but Kepa springs down to push it out. The rebound comes out to Van Dijk, who looks certain to score. He lifts it goalwards - but Kepa somehow jumps up and pushes it on to the bar! What a save! Somehow Chelsea survive. Just call Kepa Jim Montgomery. 74 min: Chelsea remove Olivier Giroud and Christian Pulisic and bring on Tammy Abraham and Mason Mount. 70 min: Both teams have run out of a little steam. 68 min: A lull. 64 min: Pedro scampers down the right and clips a ball back to Pulisic, whose effort is deflected over by Gomez. 64 min: Gini Wijnaldum replaces James Milner. 62 min: Pulisic skips inside from the left and tries to spring Pedro clear. Van Dijk deflects it behind for a corner. 59 min: \u201cStrange isn\u2019t it, almost as though playing your best players helps you play better,\u201d Callum Macauley says. \u201cMilner for Wijnaldum and Liverpool could put this to bed.\u201d 58 min: This is a different game now. Chelsea can\u2019t get out of their half. 55 min: \u201cYes, David Wall,\u201d Matt Dony says. \u201cMourinho is always right. Luke Shaw has been completely invisible tonight. Absolute waste of space. Also, Firmino is playing like he was offended by being left out of the starting XI.\u201d 54 min: Chelsea haven\u2019t got a clue how to handle Firmino. He picks the ball up deep, turns, runs at a retreating defence and almost carves them open with the help of Salah. 51 min: Firmino is tormenting Chelsea\u2019s centre-backs, who allow the Brazilian too much space to turn and send Mane away down the left. Mane\u2019s ball across finds Henderson, whose deflected side-footer momentarily looks to be sneaking over Kepa, who adjusts well on his knees to spring up and make the save. 50 min: Chelsea respond, Emerson skipping through on the left and staying on his feet after a lunge from Gomez. He waits a little too long after reaching the byline and in the end his cutback hits Giroud and goes behind. 49 min: Firmino is making a huge difference for Liverpool. He holds the ball on the edge of the area, then lays it off to Fabinho, who fires wide. An instant impact from Roberto Firmino. Played onside by Azpilicueta, he reacts quickest when Fabinho lobs a ball over the top of the Chelsea defence and gets there before Kepa. He knocks it round the Chelsea goalkeeper, but his shot doesn\u2019t have enough pace on it and it\u2019s Mane who finishes it off, bundling the ball over the line from a few yards. There\u2019s a quick VAR check but the goal stands and Liverpool are level. That didn\u2019t take long. 47 min: \u201cGiven that Lampard has largely gone with more experienced players tonight than at Old Trafford is that a concession that Mourinho might have had a point?\u201d David Wall wonders. 46 min: Chelsea get the second half underway. Liverpool have made a change, replacing Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain with the superb Roberto Firmino. Frank Lampard\u2019s Chelsea lead thanks to Olivier Giroud\u2019s goal. They\u2019ve been impressive. Liverpool have been unimpressive. 42 min: Jorginho sends a volley out for a throw. That was useless. Not as useless as Liverpool, though. They\u2019ve missed Firmino\u2019s intelligence up front. 41 min: Pulisic was offside - but it was a very tidy finish from the American, who cut inside from the left and drilled a low shot inside Adrian\u2019s near post from 18 yards. 40 min: Pulisic has the ball in the Liverpool net, but the flag\u2019s up for offside. They\u2019re checking it. N\u2019Golo Kante takes charge in the centre again, driving past Fabinho and holding off Mane before finding Christian Pulisic. This time the American has the composure to lift his head, pick a pass and slip the ball through to Giroud, who uses his left foot to slip a low finish under Adrian! Chelsea have a deserved lead. This is a lovely goal. 32 min: Jorginho\u2019s name is misspelled on his shirt. It says Jorghino! Oh, we have some fun. Back to the action. Pedro threads a lovely ball through to Kovacic, who tries to skip round Adrian, but the Liverpool goalkeeper\u2019s having none of it. 30 min: Another corner to Liverpool, this time on the right. Milner takes it again and his cross finds Mane in acres of space. But he can\u2019t steer his header past Kepa. 29 min: A corner to Liverpool on the left. Milner swings it and Kepa vacates his line and gets nowhere near the cross. He\u2019s lucky Van Dijk heads over. 27 min: The irrepressible Kante nips in to win possession again, this time inside Liverpool\u2019s half. He finds Pedro, who moves it on to Pulisic, in space on the left. He goes on the outside and looks short of conviction as he slashes a cross across the face of goal. Giroud and Pedro look at him quizzically. 24 min: Chelsea are growing in confidence. So much so that Giroud tries an overhead kick from 15 yards. He shins it wide. Full marks for pluck, though. 22 min: Pedro hits the bar! He plays a great one-two with Giroud, slips into the left of the Liverpool area and decides to have a pop from a tight angle. His shot beats Adrian but bounces off the bar and away to safety. 21 min: Kovacic slides a brilliant ball through to Pedro, but who\u2019s there to mop up for Liverpool? Andy Robertson. There\u2019s no getting round him. 17 min: Liverpool get themselves into a bit of a tangle at the back and the ball ricochets away to the right for Pedro. His cross is punched out into the middle by a diving Adrian, who\u2019s grateful to see the ball reach a team-mate. 16 min: Oxlade-Chamberlain does well to hold off Kante on the left, look up and lift a ball over the top for Salah, who scoots away from Emerson and attempts to poke the ball past Kepa with the outside of his left foot. But the Chelsea goalkeeper pushes the ball clear and his side embark on another counter. Pedro sends Giroud away, but he doesn\u2019t have the pace to get away and slashes a shot wide from 18 yards. 14 min: There is a pitch invader. He is quickly dealt with. 13 min: Henderson sets off on another buccaneering run down the right and whips a magnificent cross into the middle. It looks like it\u2019s going to make it to Mane, only for Christensen to save Chelsea with a last-ditch diving header. Mane heads over from the resulting corner. 11 min: Pedro cuts inside from the right and has a dig from 20 yards. Adrian watches it go wide of the far post. 10 min: A poor clearance from Kepa sets Liverpool on the attack, but Salah\u2019s shot is blocked on the edge of the area. 9 min: A loose ball breaks to Fabinho on the left of the Chelsea area, but the Brazilian slams a shot straight into Kepa\u2019s gloves. 7 min: The first indication of what Kante brings to Chelsea comes when he easily stops Milner 25 yards from goal, then bursts away with the ball and starts an attack. How they missed him on Sunday. 5 min: Henderson charges down the right and sends in a cross that Mane meets with an acrobatic overhead kick. It hits Christensen on the arms and deflects wide for a corner. There\u2019s no suggestion of VAR getting involved. 4 min: Giroud tries to spring Pedro clear down the right, but Van Dijk blocks the pass with his arm. Illegally. Stephanie Frappart penalises the defender and ignores Azpilicueta\u2019s appeals for a yellow card. Moments later Pulisic threatens in Liverpool\u2019s area, but Matip\u2019s too strong for the American. 2 min: Sadio Mane has started in a central role for Liverpool, with Mo Salah on the right of the front three and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain on the left. Peep! They\u2019re off. Liverpool, all in red, get the game underway, kicking from left to right in the first half. Chelsea are in blue and the pitch doesn\u2019t look great. Here come the teams! Liverpool won the Super Cup in 1977, 2001 and 2005. Chelsea won it in 1998, beating Real Madrid thanks to a late goal from Gus Poyet. Pre-match emails \u201cIt\u2019s a quaint concept this \u201cneeding time,\u201d but like that old zinger \u201cthe social contract\u201d I wonder if Chelsea fans have now changed with the culture and would accept that if this does not work in the next couple of weeks then the trapdoor into the waiting taxi is fine by them,\u201d Ian Copestake says. \u201cBesiktas Park?\u201d Peter Oh says. \u201cIsn\u2019t that where Loris Karius was loaned to? He\u2019s probably in the stadium, right? Well, nothing against Adri\u00e1n, but couldn\u2019t Kloppo slap some gloves on the much-maligned German keeper, nudge him onto the field and thereby give him a shot at European cup final redemption?\u201d Frank Lampard speaks! \u201cI wasn\u2019t here last year, winning the Europa League, they fought for this. We want to win it. The lads are ready. The players who got us here last year deserve a crack.\u201d Jurgen Klopp speaks! \u201cYou have to consider all the different circumstances. Maybe we have to go a little longer. It all has to be involved.\u201d Pre-match reading Liverpool make a few changes to the side that beat Norwich last Friday. In come Joe Gomez, James Milner, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Sadio Mane, replacing Trent Alexander-Arnold, Gini Wijnaldum, Roberto Firmino and Divock Origi. Meanwhile former West Ham goalkeeper Adrian is in for the injured Alisson, while Naby Keita is out with a thigh strain. Chelsea have a more experienced and conservative look to them than they did against Manchester United. In comes N\u2019Golo Kante as part of a midfield three, Christian Pulisic makes his first start and Olivier Giroud is up front. The players who drop out are the youthful Mason Mount, Ross Barkley and Tammy Abraham. You\u2019ll also notice that the referee is Stephanie Frappert, who\u2019s making history by becoming the first woman to officiate a major men\u2019s European match. She refereed the women\u2019s World Cup final in July and has taken charge of Ligue 1 matches since April. Liverpool: Adrian; Gomez, Matip, Van Dijk, Robertson; Fabinho, Henderson, Milner; Oxlade-Chamberlain, Salah, Mane. Chelsea: Kepa; Azpilicueta, Zouma, Christensen, Alonso; Kante, Jorginho, Kovacic; Pedro, Giroud, Pulisic. Referee: Stephanie Frappart (France) Hello.

      "bodyText": "The former Conservative MP Sarah Wollaston has joined the Liberal Democrats in a much-anticipated move, the party has announced. On the more pro-remain and socially liberal side of the Tories, Wollaston quit the party in February with colleagues Anna Soubry and Heidi Allen to join the group that became Change UK. In June, she was among six of Change UK\u2019s eventual 11 MPs who left to become independents, amid splits over tactics in the group. One of these was the former Labour MP, Chuka Umunna, who then moved to the Lib Dems. The MP for Totnes since 2010, after she was chosen by a then-innovative open selection process, Wollaston is a former GP who chairs the Commons health and social care committee. With the Lib Dems\u2019 victory at the start of the month in the Brecon and Radnorshire byelection, Wollaston is the party\u2019s third new MP in recent months in a move that boosts their number to 14 in the Commons. Wollaston said in a statement she was \u201cdelighted to be joining the Liberal Democrats under the leadership of Jo Swinson\u201d. She said: \u201cI believe the best way for me to represent my constituents in Totnes is to be working as part of a fantastic team of Liberal Democrat MPs who are unequivocally making the case for us to remain at the heart of Europe, as well as campaigning for social justice, the environment and our public services.\u201d Swinson said: \u201cI am delighted to welcome Sarah to the Liberal Democrats.

German manufacturing has been hit hard by the US-China trade war and the woes of the auto sector is the main area of weakness. GDP in the Eurozone overall, by contrast, fared rather better in Q2 with a 0.2% gain.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all for today, as New York traders head home after a grueling day dominated by anxiety over the health of America\u2019s economy. Goodnight! The S&amp;P 500 index, which covers a wider range of companies than the Dow, also shed 2.9% today. Retail chain Macy\u2019s was the worst performer, slumping by over 13% after posting dire earnings figures today. Tech stock also struggled today, with Amazon losing 3.3% and Apple down 3%. Our economics editor Larry Elliott argues that the slump in bond yields is vindication for Trump in his battle with the Federal Reserve. He writes: The Fed is highly sensitive to what is happening on Wall Street and a rate cut at its next meeting in September is a nailed-on certainty. Some analysts, Steen Jakobsen at Saxo Bank, for instance, think that the US central bank may not wait that long and instead announce an emergency cut before its scheduled meeting. That still seems a bit of a long shot but the accumulation of bad economic news means that the battle between the Fed and the White House has been won decisively by Trump. All that remains is to see how much face the Fed\u2019s chairman, Jerome Powell, can save. More here: Donald Trump is leaving no doubt about who he blames for the sell off: However, America hasn\u2019t yet won major concessions from China, and the trade war is clearly a factor in the slowdown. Today\u2019s sell off is one of the biggest points falls on the Dow ever: However, it\u2019s less dramatic in percentage terms: Ouch! The Dow has just closed, deeper in the red than ever. The benchmark index shed 3%, or exactly 800 points, to end the day at 25,479. That shows investors remain very concerned that the global economy is weakening, with recession risks rising in Germany, the US and the UK, with China also a big concern. Here\u2019s our news story on today\u2019s market gyrations: Update: Wall Street is refusing to shake off its gloom, and is actually hitting new lows. With barely an hour\u2019s trading to go, the Dow is down an alarming 763 points, or 2.9%, at 25,515 points. Are you sitting comfortably? Then here\u2019s a short story about the problem Time for a recap Stocks have plunged on both sides of the Atlantic as fears grow that America could fall into recession, dragged down by a global slowdown and the trade war with China. On Wall Street, the main share indices have lost at least 2.5% as a big wave of selling rips through the markets. The Dow Jones industrial average lost more than 700 points at one stage, with banks, tech stocks and industrial companies suffering sharp falls. In London, the FTSE 100 tumbled by more than 103 points, hitting its lowest closing level since March. The selloff was sparked by alarm that both the US and UK government bond yields inverted today, as bond prices soared. That means that traders are accepting a lower interest rate to hold longer-dated bonds than the shorter-dated alternative. An inverted yield curve is an unusual situation that typically only happens before a recession, at least in America. It\u2019s a classic warning light, which has flashed ominously brightly today. However, some experts - including former top central banker Janet Yellen - believe that a recession can be avoided. They believe the bond market is predicting low growth in the future, but hopefully not a full-blown downturn. The White House has responded by renewing its call for US interest rate cuts soon. President Trump claimed the Fed had made two huge mistakes, while trade advisor Peter Navarro predicted borrowing costs would be slashed in the coming months. Traders were also alarmed by new data showing that Germany\u2019s economy shrank by 0.1% in the second quarter of 2019. Germany joined the UK and Sweden as the worst-performing EU members, as eurozone growth halved to 0.2%. Germany\u2019s economy suffered from a slump in exports, due to trade war tensions. Economists believe that Berlin should boost government spending quickly, to prop up growth. Otherwise, Europe\u2019s largest economy could soon fall into recession. Newsflash: President Donald Trump has launched another salvo at Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell. Trump is unhappy with the way Powell presented last month\u2019s interest rate cut, and (as usual) is pushing the Fed for more aggressive cuts. Given the torrent of criticism from Trump, Powell may feel his first mistake was accepting the offer to run the Fed at all! The president has also appeared to welcome the plunge in US bond yields today, caused by a dash to buy Treasury bills. Attention traders! Former Federal Reserve Chairman Janet Yellen believes the markets may be wrong in assuming that the inverted US yield curve is signalling a recession. Speaking on Fox Business, Yellen said that this time things are different.... Historically, it has been a pretty good signal of recession, and it think that\u2019s when markets pay attention to it, but I would really urge that on this occasion it may be a less good signal. The reason for that is there are a number of factors other than market expectations about the future path of interest rates that are pushing down long-term yields.\u201d Yellen also believes that America will avoid a recession, but revealed she is becoming more concerned: I think the U.S. economy has enough strength to avoid that, but the odds have clearly risen and their higher than I\u2019m frankly comfortable with.\u201d Ouch! The Dow Jones industrial average has now lost more than 700 points, as Wall Street traders continue hammering their sell buttons. The benchmark index is now down 2.7% at 25,561. Each of the 30 companies on the Dow is in the red, with the mining sector shedding 4.4%, banks down 3.6% and energy firms down 3.2%. The broader S&amp;P 500 index has also lost 2.7%, while the Nasdaw is down 3% as tech stocks are pummelled. Recession fears are flooding over the trading floors, even though several economists have cautioned against panicking over the inverted US yield curve. As David Madden of CMC Markets puts it: The inversion of the US 2 year yield and the US 10 year yield has sent shockwaves through the markets, and that has forewarned recessions in the US, and traders are running scared. The major indices sold-off sharply for fear the US is heading for a recession. The underlying fundamentals are solid as the jobless rate is at multi-decade lows, and average earnings are outstripping inflation, but for now dealers are focusing on the yield curve, and equities are taking a hammering. Economics expert Duncan Weldon has written a interesting thread about today\u2019s bond market developments. He argues that the slump in bond yields shows anxiety about growth prospects, but not necessarily a recession. Why? Because previous recessions have often been caused by rising interest rates (to cool inflation), while today\u2019s central banks are likely to cut borrowing costs (where possible) to stimulate growth. Bloomberg\u2019s Michael McDonough makes a good point \u2013 who will get the blame if America slides into recession? Many economists would point to the US\u2013China trade war, which has disrupted the global economy and contributed to the slowdown. President Trump, though, has already blamed the US Federal Reserve for raising interest rates too high (nine times since the financial crisis ended), and being too slow to respond (its first cut in a decade came last month) The Fed\u2019s next meeting is on September 17-18, where it could lower borrowing costs again. But Steen Jakobsen, chief economist &amp; CIO at Saxo Bank, claims the Fed might have to unleash an emergency rate cut to calm the markets. He told clients today that the Fed is behind the curve: The only way to \u2018move\u2019 the market now in my opinion being moving [rates] between scheduled meetings. They need to produce faster or more. Both are likely, but by faster would be my choice! Rip off the band aid. Here\u2019s a video clip of White House trade adviser Peter Navarro predicting hefty cuts to US interest rates this autumn: Wall Street is showing a distinct reluctance to bounce. Stocks are ploughing new lows, with the Dow now down 660 points or 2.5%. Today investors have scrambled desperately into safe-haven assets, such as government bonds and gold, and out of the risky stuff including oil and shares. That\u2019s driven bond yields to record lows (Germany\u2019s benchmark 10-year bund fell deeper into negative yield territory), and pushed stock markets to their weakest point in several months. European stock markets have hit their lowest level in six months: Newsflash: Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 stock index has just closed, down 103 points at 7,147. That\u2019s its lowest closing level since March this year, and means the index has lost over 400 points since the start of August. Engineering firm Melrose was the top faller, down 5.75%, followed by mining group Evraz (-5.2%). Holiday group TUI and airline group IAG, which would also suffer in a recession, lost 4.3%. In the City, the FTSE 100 is being dragged lower and lower too. The index of top London-listed shares has now lost 134 points, or 1.85%, falling to 7,116 points. That\u2019s its lowest in over two months. Fiona Cincotta, senior analyst at City Index.co.uk, says fears of a global downturn are stalking the markets: Doom and gloom dominated after data showed that Chinese industrial output grew at the slowest pace in 17 years, whilst the German economy contracted. Recession warning bells rang out across the markets as Trump\u2019s delaying of tariffs on some Chinese imports is a case of too little too latte \u2013 the damage to economies has already been done. Ouch! The Dow has now slumped deeper into the red, down 2.25% or 591 points at 25,688. Here\u2019s a reminder that inverted yield curves don\u2019t IMMEDIATELY lead to recessions; it can take a year or more. Investors have been snapping up long-term US government debt today, sending the yield (interest rate) on 30-year Treasury bills to record lows (meaning prices are at record highs). A US recession may be approaching, but it might not actually arrive for a couple of years. So argues Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors, who predicts the downturn could be delayed until 2021, if central bankers take action. She writes: \u201cThe US economy is clearly weakening and risks are piling up. Capex will inevitably slow further, but under the assumption that the trade war doesn\u2019t escalate further, it will not weaken so much as to tip the US into recession. The Fed pivot in early 2019, global central bank easing, China stimulus and the reversal of its deleveraging process will support the global economy. Certainly our own recession risk model suggests that while the probability of a US recession has increased, it still isn\u2019t our central scenario. \u201cNotably the historical success of the yield curve as a recessionary signal is too strong to dismiss. However, the lead time of its signalling can be several years, so it is our best bet that while recession is unlikely in 2020, the following year may be a fairer bet as concerns about leverage in the corporate debt maker start to come to the fore. Even so, there are certainly enough risks globally to prompt investors to take reasonable defensive positioning in their portfolios right now. Mohamed A. El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz, says this morning\u2019s weak German GDP report has helped to drive bond yields down today. He also cites poor Chinese industrial data released overnight, showing the smallest rise in factory output since 2002 -- another sign of economic slowdown. Most of the big names on the Dow Jones industrial average are also in the red, haunted by recession worries. Pharmaceutical firm WalGreens Boots Alliance is the top faller, down 3.2%, followed by chemicals firm Dow Inc (-3%), financial giant Goldman Sachs (-2.8%) and entertainment group Walt Disney (-2.75%). This is keeping the DJIA down 1.5%, or 400-ish points, at 25,881. Technology stocks are being hit hard now, sending the Nasdaq index down by 2%, or 150 points at 7,577. Virtually every stock on the Nasdaq is in the red, with chipmakers AMD (-4.5%) and Micron (-3.3%) among the fallers. Newsflash: Donald Trump\u2019s trade adviser has said the slump in US bond yields proves that American interest rates should be cut. Peter Navarro also told Fox News that the \u201cbiggest problem\u201d which America is currently fighting is the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate policy. So much for central bank independence.... But yes, today\u2019s selloff will pile more pressure on the Fed to cut rates at its September meeting, having already made its first cut in a decade in July. Trump has repeatedly criticised the Fed chair Jerome Powell for not cutting rates faster, so he could weigh in too. However, the president is currently more focused on curveballs than yield curve, judging by his latest tweet.... Newsflash: Stocks are sliding at the start of trading in New York, as investors fear that an American recession could be looming In early trading.... Dow Jones industrial average: down 425 points or 1.6% at 25,854 S&amp;P 500: Down 44 points or 1.5% at 2,881 Nasdaq: Down 138 points or 1.7% at 7,878 Technology stocks and banks are among the fallers, as traders shun risky assets. Bank of America has shed almost 3%, while Apple has lost 2.3%. The inversion of America\u2019s government bond yield curve today has clearly worried Wall Street, given its track record of predicting recessions. Back in April, the Financial Times wrote a handy feature on the inverted yield curve (full marks for prescience!). It\u2019s online here, explaining how some experts don\u2019t think it\u2019s terribly reliable as a recession indicator today, while others think it could cause a recession. Here\u2019s a flavour: The yield curve is Wall Street\u2019s original \u2018fear gauge\u2019, notching up a perfect predictive record before pretenders such as the Vix index were even glimmers in the eyes of financial engineers. Typically, countries pay less to borrow for three months than five years, and less for five years than for a decade \u2014 after all, investors want some compensation for the gradual erosion of inflation, or the risk, albeit faint, that a government could renege on its debt. Plotted on a graph, the bond yields of various maturities form a \u201cyield curve\u201d that most of the time slopes gently upwards. But sometimes short-term yields rise above longer-term ones, an \u201cinversion\u201d of the usual shape of the curve that has been an uncannily accurate harbinger of recessions, preceding every downturn since the end of the second world war. It\u2019s worth remembering that an inverted yield curve doesn\u2019t signal an immediate US recession \u2013 the downturn could be a year away. That would coincide with the next presidential election, potentially undermining Donald Trump\u2019s re-election bid. Trump has frequently pointed to the stock market as evidence that he\u2019s doing a good job (the Dow Jones soared by almost a third during his first year in office). So any downturn would alarm the White House, and perhaps intensify calls for US interest rates to be cut. The futures market is signalling a rough day on Wall Street, with the US benchmark stock indices called down at least 1.3% That would wipe out Tuesday\u2019s rally (sparked by relief that America is delaying some tariffs on Chinese-made electronics goods). Economics professor Paul Krugman argues that the slump in government bond yields contains an important message -- politicians can, and should, borrow more to fund investment. Despite today\u2019s market turmoil, the office rental chain WeWork has just announced plans to float on the US stock market. WeWork is a workplace start-up, which rents out co-working spaces to startups, freelancers and enterprises. At one stage it even offered free beer... which might help explain why it\u2019s not made a profit yet, losing $2bn in 2018. WeWork is hoping to raise around $3bn through an IPO. Earlier this year it was valued at an eye-watering $47bn by Softbank, its largest investor \u2013 or 26 times its earnings. With more than half a million members, WeWork is clearly popular. But such companies are vulnerable to an economic downturn, which would presumably push down the rent they can charge. The Financial Times editor, Lionel Barber, thinks this could signal the top of the market... Newsflash: Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index of top blue-chip companies has hit its lowest level since early June. The Footsie has shed 102 points to 7,148, its lowest level since 4 June. Yuk: The oil price is sliding - another sign that traders are bracing for a slowdown. Brent crude (oil sourced from the North Sea) has dropped by 2.8% to $59.59 per barrel. Here\u2019s Newsnight\u2019s Ben Chu: The selloff is gathering pace. In London, the FTSE 100 is now down 93 points or 1.28% at 7,158, close to a two-month low. Germany\u2019s DAX has slumped by over 2%, dragged down by recession worries after today\u2019s GDP report, to its lowest levels since March. The gold price, meanwhile, has jumped 1% to $1,515, towards the six-year high struck yesterday. The US and UK yield curve inversion is part of a wider surge of money into government debt. This has been going on for months, pushing bond prices to new highs (and driving yields to new lows, as they move inversely to prices). Astonishingly, there is now $16 trillion of debt trading at negative bond yields -- meaning the debt is changing hands above its face value. [Reminder: government bonds pay out a regular coupon, and then investors get the value of the bond back when it matures.] Much of that debt was issued by eurozone governments, with investors gambling that the European Central Bank will launch a new quantitative easing bond-buying programme. David Absolon, investment director at Heartwood Investment Management, says it\u2019s a sign of investor angst: While certain drivers of growth in the global economy (such as the buoyancy of the US consumer) have been robust, weak economic data overall has given investment markets cause for concern. Growing unease has led to a flight to safe haven assets like government bonds, as continued fears around global growth push wary investors to preserve as much capital as possible at all costs. Bloomberg have written a handy explanation of what an inverted yield curve is, and why it matters \u2013 it\u2019s online here. It explains that: A yield curve shows the different interest rates paid for holding shorter or longer-dated government debt. Typically you get a higher return for buying longer-dated bonds, due to the extra risk (a financial or political crisis could erupt before the bond matures and you get your money back). An inverted yield curve occurs when that premium for holding longer-term bonds drops below zero -- for example, the rate on 10-year bonds is below the two-year notes. Why does it matter? The yield curve shows whether investors think inflation (and by implication growth) will keep rising. In a recession, consumer demand will slide, dragging down inflation -- meaning investors can accept a lower rate of return. Plus, in a downturn, investors are more concerned with capital preservation than profits. In America, traders are waking up to the news that the US yield curve has inverted. Wall Street is predicted to fall by around 1% when trading begins in two hours, as investors ponder whether the bond market is signalling a recession. Ouch! Deutsche Bank\u2019s economics team have predicted that Germany will fall into recession this autumn. They predict that GDP will contract in the current quarter, meeting the classic definition that a recession is two consecutive quarters of negative growth. Deutsche also warned clients that the recession could last until next year, saying: Q2 GDP drop of -0.1% qoq was the second quarterly contraction within the last 12 months. Given the deteriorated outlook for the second half of the year we have cut our 2019 GDP forecast to 0.3% (from 0.7%). A rapid recovery from this low growth environment in 2020 seems unlikely from today\u2019s perspective. Given the 1.5% slump in June industrial production (negative carry-over), the further clear weakening of ifo and PMI surveys in July, and the nosediving August ZEW, we expect a drop of about 0.25% for Q3 GDP, pushing the economy into a technical recession. We expect stagnation in Q4 assuming that the major global areas of uncertainty do at least not see a further escalation. If this assumption turns out too optimistic, negative quarterly growth rates could prevail into 2020. Rupert Thompson, head of research at the wealth manager Kingswood, believes that the European Central Bank will be forced to act to fight a German recession. He writes: German GDP fell 0.1% q/q in Q2. While this contraction followed a 0.4% gain in Q1, the underlying picture is that Germany is perilously close to falling into recession. Indeed, German investor economic confidence nose-dived in August, suggesting there will be no early reprieve. German manufacturing has been hit hard by the US-China trade war and the woes of the auto sector is the main area of weakness. GDP in the Eurozone overall, by contrast, fared rather better in Q2 with a 0.2% gain. Even so, with the risks to growth skewed to the downside, the ECB still looks all but certain to cut rates next month and a re-start of its quantitative easing programme is also quite possible. This chart shows how the difference between longer-dated and shorter-dated US and UK government bond yields have fallen steadily in recent months -- leading to today\u2019s worrying inversion. The BBC\u2019s Faisal Islam fears that the bond yield gyrations show the global economy is in trouble - just as the Brexit crisis intensifies. European stock markets are heading further south, worried by the drama in the bond market. Germany\u2019s DAX is now down 1.6%, while the UK\u2019s FTSE 100 is down 0.9%. Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB (also hit by political instability in Rome) has lost almost 2%. The UK yield curve has also inverted in the last few minutes, according to Reuters. That\u2019s the first time since the financial crisis that Britain\u2019s two-year government debt has traded at a higher yield than the 10-year option. James Mackintosh of the Wall Street Journal suggests British policymakers shouldn\u2019t panic too much -- it doesn\u2019t always herald a UK recession. The inversion of the US yield curve is a \u2018massive red warning light\u2019 for the US economy, says Neil Wilson of Markets.com. He points out that this is often (but not always) a harbinger of recession: It\u2019s the first time it\u2019s happened since 2007. Meanwhile the 30-year has slumped to a record low. The market is saying the risks are tilted very much to the downside. We are in a new phase of the cycle for markets now. To recap well-worn turf, this inversion been a reliable indicator of recession many times in the past, calling seven out of the last nine. There is undoubtedly a chance of this, although we must caution that so far the US data has been pretty sturdy in the face of global headwinds and the trade policies of the White House. This yield curve inversion is a sell signal for risk assets and should put extra pressure on equities. Futures in the US had been tracking Europe lower and are extending their declines. Yesterday\u2019s bounce is proving short-lived. Gold pushed up higher on the news, spiking through $1506, as it cemented its recovery after yesterday\u2019s selloff. Newsflash: The US yield curve has inverted, intensifying fears that America\u2019s economy could be falling into recession. For non-bond experts... that means that the interest rate on 10-year American government debt has now fallen below the rate on the 2-year equivalent. Right now, two-year Treasuries are trading at a yield of 1.634%, while 10-year T-Bills only offer 1.628%. In normal times, longer-dated government debt should offer a better rate of return - as there\u2019s simply more time for something to go wrong before the money is due to be repaid. So an inverted yield curve is a worrying sign -- it implies that investors are more pessimistic about future growth prospects. In the past, an inverted US yield curve has been followed by a recession. Back in the markets, shares are selling off again as investors worry about the global economy. Fears of a German recession, and news overnight that Chinese industrial production growth has hit a 17-year low, are driving the selloff. The burst of optimism of a breakthrough in the US-China trade talks, after America delayed some tariffs, may also be fading. Margaret Yang of CMC Markets explains: Here the damage: FTSE 100: Down 49 points or 0.7% at 7,200 German DAX: Down 125 points or 1% at 11,624 French CAC: Down 51 points or 0.95% at 5,312 Andrew Kenningham from Capital Economics has warned that a no-deal Brexit would hurt German exporters, making a recession even more likely. He says: The bottom line is that the German economy is teetering on the edge of recession. The UK and Germany - Europe\u2019s largest economies - were also its worst-performing members in the second quarter of this year. They, along with Sweden, were the only countries to suffer a contraction in April-June. Italy performed poorly too, with no growth, while France and Belgium managed lacklustre growth of 0.2% Here are some highlights from today\u2019s growth report from Eurostat (which includes today\u2019s German GDP data, and last week\u2019s UK GDP) Poland: Grew by 0.8% in Q2, quarter-on-quarter Portugal: Grew by 0.5% Spain: Grew by 0.5% Netherlands: Grew by 0.5% Belgium: Grew by 0.2% France: Grew by 0.2% Italy: Stagnated Sweden: Contracted by 0.1% Germany: Contracted by 0.1% The UK: Contracted by 0.2% The Eurozone: Grew by 0.2% The EU: Grew by 0.2% NEWSFLASH: Growth across the euro area halved in the last quarter, from 0.4% to 0.2% in Q1, as Germany\u2019s contraction held the region back. That\u2019s according to data firm Eurostat, and matches its initial estimate of eurozone GDP released at the end of July. The wider EU also only grew by 0.2%, down from 0.5% in January-March. More to follow... The jump in UK inflation to 2.1% last month could spur the Bank of England to raise interest rates, despite Brexit uncertainty. My colleague Richard Partington explains: City economists had forecast CPI to fall to 1.9% - instead, it\u2019s now over the Bank\u2019s target of 2%. The unexpected rise could pile pressure on Threadneedle Street to raise interest rates, even as economic growth falters, in a potential sign the UK could begin to mirror the stagflation of the 1970s - when growth stalled yet inflation continued to rise. The Bank has said it could be forced to raise interest rates if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, saying the pound would plunge to drive up the cost of imports. However, most analysts believe it would need to cut rates to support jobs and growth. Sterling has come under intense selling pressure since the elevation of Boris Johnson to No 10, however the ONS said it was still too early to identify whether the weakness in the pound had started to push up the cost of living. It said the rising price of computer games, consoles and hotel prices rising more than they did last year had pushed up the rate of CPI from 2% in June. In an ironic twist amid the public anger over British rail fares, the ONS said that little change in the price of an international train ticket over the past year prevented UK inflation from rising by a greater extent in June. A reminder of how Germany\u2019s economy has stumbled over the last year, including this morning\u2019s disappointing drop in GDP. Brexit uncertainty may also be having a chilling impact on UK house prices - at least in the South of England. Figures just released shows that the average property price fell in London, again, by 2.7% compared to a year ago. London house prices have now been falling over the year since March 2018. Prices also dropped by 0.6% in the South East, and by 0.2% in the South West. But... the picture is brighter elsewhere, with prices 3.2% higher in the East Midlands. Overall prices rose by 0.9% per year, according to the Office for National Statistics. Newsflash: the latest UK inflation data is out, showing that the cost of living keeps rising. Britain\u2019s consumer prices index rose by 2.1% in the year to July, up from 2%. That\u2019s higher than expected: economists thought the CPI would drop to 1.9%. However, real wages are still rising \u2013 we learned yesterday that basic pay grew by 3.9% over the last year. Another inflation measure, the Retail Prices Index, dropped to 2.8% in July from 2.9% in June. That will be used to set UK rail ticket prices next year, meaning commuters face higher costs. Katharina Uterm\u00f6hl of Allianz has written about the growing risk of a German recession: After a good start to the year, the German economy has gone in reverse gear. In the second quarter, seasonally adjusted GDP shrank by 0.1%. The weak foreign trade performance and declining construction investment proved sufficient to bring the German economy to its knees, despite continued positive consumption impulses. In view of the subdued outlook for world trade and the automotive industry and lingering elevated political uncertainty around trade, Italy and Brexit, at best mini-growth rates can be expected in the coming quarters. It is particularly worrying that the weakness in industry is increasingly affecting domestic demand. After all, the German economy has so far been kept afloat primarily by private consumption and construction investment. Due to the very weak start to the third quarter, the recession risk is now at a high level. In better news for the eurozone, French joblessness has hit its lowest level since the financial crisis. Reuters has the details: France\u2019s unemployment rate fell to 8.5% in the second quarter from 8.7% in the first, according to data from the INSEE national statistics office, marking the lowest jobless rate in the euro zone\u2019s second-biggest economy since the end of 2008. Six economists polled by Reuters had forecast on average an unemployment rate of 8.7% for the second quarter. A steady improvement in the jobs market has offered French President Emmanuel Macron some relief in the face of months of street protests against government policies often criticised for favouring the wealthier members of society. Just in: The Netherlands economy outperformed Germany in the last quarter. Dutch GDP increased by 0.5% in April-June, new government figures show, as it shook off the impact of the global slowdown and the US-China trade dispute. Growth was supported by strong exports and consumer spending. Germany\u2019s weak (non) growth report has dampened the mood on the Frankfurt stock exchange. The DAX index of top German companies has fallen by 33 points, or 0.3%, in early trading to 11,713. Banks and industrial groups are among the top fallers, with Deutsche Bank losing 2.2%, tyremaker Continental down 1.7% and conglomerate ThyssenKrupp shedding 2.7%. France\u2019s stock market is also down 0.4%, while Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 is flat this morning. Matthias Weber, economist at the University of St.Gallen, argues firmly that Germany should increase government spending to shore up growth -- especially as borrowing costs are so low. Given the current economic situation at the beginning of a recession, now would be the perfect time for Germany to support the economy by investing in its future. Public investments in railways, roads, bridges, childcare centres, public schools, and renewable energy are much needed. Such investments could currently be made at an extremely low (even negative) interest rate and they would boost the slowing aggregate demand. It is unfortunate that some politicians cling to an economically unsound \u201cconcept\u201d of zero debt and therefore miss out on these investment opportunities for Germany. German government bonds prices have jumped to fresh record highs this morning, driving down the yield (or interest rate) on the debt to new record lows. The yield on Germany\u2019s 10-year bund has now hit MINUS 0.62%, the lowest ever - meaning traders are paying MORE than the face value of the bonds. That means: Investors anticipate low growth and weak inflation They\u2019re looking for somewhere safe to park their money Germany would have no problem borrowing to invest in new infrastructure to spur growth Strategist Andreas Steno Larsen of Nordea Markets says Germany\u2019s woes aren\u2019t a surprise, given all the grim economic data recently: Economist Oliver Rakau of Oxford Economists suggests Berlin could launch a \u2018cash for clunkers\u2019 scheme - subsidising new car sales - to ward off a recession. But stimulating the economy won\u2019t be easy, he warns in this Twitter thread: The slump in German growth could force Angela Merkel to ditch her long-running opposition to government borrowing. Germany\u2019s \u2018debt brake\u2019 law forces its leaders to run balanced budgets, rather than running up deficits. But with an economy struggling, and borrowing costs extremely low, there\u2019s a strong argument for tapping the bond market to fund more investment. As Marija Veitmane of State Street put it on Bloomberg TV this morning: We are getting to a point where the German government has to do something to stimulate the economy. Yesterday, Merkel hinted that she could loosen the purse strings, telling a town hall meeting that her government would take action if needed. The chancellor said: \u201cIt\u2019s true, we\u2019re heading into a difficult phase....We will react depending on the situation.\u201d Unicredit analyst Andreas Rees reckons Germany\u2019s economy has been hurt by the uncertainty over Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union. Rees says: For a year now, the German economy has been only crawling forward. Besides Brexit, this is above all the U.S.-Sino trade dispute and possible U.S. tariffs on European cars. Today\u2019s GDP report marks \u201cthe end of a golden decade for the German economy\u201d, says Carsten Brzeski, chief economist for Germany at Dutch bank ING. Brzeski sounds deeply disappointed to learn that the German economy contracted by 0.1% in the last quarter. He blames the damaging uncertainty caused by Donald Trump\u2019s trade war with China, along with problems at Germany\u2019s carmakers, writing: Trade conflicts, global uncertainty and the struggling automotive sector have finally brought the German economy down on its knee. In particular, increased uncertainty, rather than direct effects from the trade conflicts, have dented sentiment and hence economic activity. Brzeski points out that Germany had been on a decent run since the financial crisis, growing at around 0.5% per quarter. Not any more.... It was a decade of strong growth on the back of earlier structural reforms, fiscal stimulus, globalisation at its peak and steroids provided by the ECB in the form of low-interest rates and a relatively weak euro. This decade, in which strong German growth looked so effortless, is coming to an end. The full note is online here. Here\u2019s Nadia Gharbi of Pictet Asset Management: Germany is clearly struggling, but it\u2019s not alone. Last week, we learned that Britain\u2019s economy contracted by 0.2% in the second quarter of this year, as the boost from Brexit stockpiling earlier in the year faded. But the UK is still doing better on a longer-term basis -- UK GDP grew by 1.2% over the last year, compared to just 0.4% annual growth for Germany. Growth across the eurozone halved last quarter, from 0.4% to 0.2%, with France growing by 0.2% and Italy stagnating (again). That data will be updated at 10am UK time.... Several economists are warning that Germany\u2019s economy could still be shrinking - plunging it into a full-blown recession. Katharina Uterm\u00f6hl, senior economist for Europe at insurance giant Allianz SE, points out that Germany has looked very weak this summer: Economics professor Sebastian Dullien agrees that recession risks are rising: Martin Grieve of German newspaper Handelsblatt points out that recent German manufacturing data has been very weak (industrial production slumped in June). Germany isn\u2019t technically in recession yet -- that would mean two successive quarters of negative growth. But still.... its economy has really struggled over the last year, and has contracted in two of the last four quarters. Today\u2019s growth reports shows that: Q3 2018: German GDP contracted by 0.1% Q4 2018: German GDP grew by 0.2% (revised higher this morning) Q1 2019: German GDP grew by 0.4% Q2 2019: German GDP shrank by 0.1% That adds up to annual growth of just 0.4% - well below the 2.2% recorded in 2017, or the 1.5% in 2018. Germany\u2019s exporting powerhouse stumbled in the April-June quarter. German exports fell during Q2, Destatis says, which is why the economy shrank by 0.1%. However, consumer and government spending helped to prop the economy up. Destatis says: Household final consumption expenditure increased, together with government final consumption expenditure. In addition, more was invested than in the first quarter, however, gross fixed capital formation in construction declined. The development of foreign trade slowed down economic growth because exports recorded a stronger quarter-on-quarter decrease than imports. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Newsflash: Germany\u2019s economy has shrunk, fuelling worries that the eurozone could be teetering close to recession. Europe\u2019s largest economy shrank by 0.1% in the second quarter of 2019, new data shows, following 0.4% growth in the first three months of the year. Destatis, the Federal Statistical Office, reports that Germany experienced \u201ca slight decline in economic performance\u201d in the last quarter, as it was dragged down by a fall in exports. Destatis also reports that Germany\u2019s economy only grew by 0.4% over the last 12 months, which looks to be the weakest performance in several years. This data confirms that Germany has suffered a blow from the slowdown in the global economy, and the US-China trade war which hurt demand for German-made goods. More to follow..... Also coming up today New UK inflation data is expected to show a slight slowdown last month, with prices rising less sharply than earnings in July. That would be a relief for households, although the recent slump in sterling could push inflation higher this summer. Global investors are feeling slightly more optimistic, after Donald Trump delayed planned tariffs on Chinese-made goods such as cell phones, laptops and video game consoles. That will avoid pre-Christmas price hikes - and could also soften tensions with Beijing. The agenda 9.30am BST: UK inflation data (CPI expected to drop to 1.9%, from 2%) 10am BST: Eurozone Q2 GDP (expected to confirm that growth slowed to 0.2%, from 0.4%).",

That is a lot of boardroom tables in the arts and cultural sector without a single seat to represent 39% of the population.

The prime minister quietly met with 21 leaders of Australia\u2019s key religions in Sydney last week, promising not to rush the laws, while assuring them he was working towards securing a \u201cworkable balance\u201d between religious freedom and competing rights. World Boris Johnson has hit out at what he described as a \u201cterrible collaboration\u201d between MPs and the EU trying to block Brexit. The British prime minister has refused to rule out shutting down parliament and holding a general election after leaving on 31 October, and said the longer the standoff continued, the more likely a no-deal Brexit was becoming. Pakistan\u2019s prime minister, Imran Khan, has threatened to \u201cteach Delhi a lesson\u201d, and vowed to fight until the end against any Indian violations in disputed Kashmir. The teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg has set sail from Plymouth in the UK on arguably her most daunting challenge yet. The 16-year-old Swede will add her increasingly influential voice to appeals for deeper emissions cuts at the Climate Action Summit in New York on 23 September, and the the UN climate conference in Santiago in early December. And a Stockholm court has found A$AP Rocky guilty of assault but spared him prison. The case that outraged the US rapper\u2019s fans had sparked a diplomatic row, after Donald Trump questioned the fairness of Sweden\u2019s judicial system. Opinion and analysis It\u2019s becoming clear that until underemployment levels fall significantly, the prospects of wages growth are non-existent, writes Greg Jericho. Things aren\u2019t looking good for the Australian government: \u201cNot only was the seasonally adjusted wage rise of 2.3% lower than the 2.5% rate predicted in the April budget, but the slowing of the growth does not bode well for the government\u2019s prediction that wage growth will be up to 2.75% this time next year.\u201d Getting up before dawn is more common than you might think, and can be great for exercise, self-improvement and wildlife watching. A study suggests that extreme early risers \u2013 people who are willingly up by 5.30am \u2013 may not just be restricted to a handful of tech CEOs and your annoying cat. About one in 300 people tracked over nearly 10 years had naturally early awake times and, while some early risers grow depressed, miserable and lonely, others fill their cherished early hours with self-improving activities like meditation. Sport There was not so much as a coin toss, let alone a ball bowled, on the the first day of the second Ashes test at Lord\u2019s, with persistent rain keeping players in the pavilion. Australia have brought in Josh Hazlewood for James Pattinson, which means that Mitchell Starc has been rested again, while England will put their faith in two bowlers who did not play at Edgbaston, Jack Leach and Jofra Archer. It seems the traditionalists will get their wish, with the Lord\u2019s Test to start on a Thursday after all. In Istanbul, the Uefa Super Cup is up for grabs, as Liverpool take on Chelsea. It\u2019s the first all-English meeting in the fixture\u2019s history. Follow our minute-by-minute report live. Thinking time: Australia\u2019s creative industry is shockingly white. But don\u2019t be discouraged There\u2019s a popular saying among those of us who champion representation, writes Beverey Wang: that you cannot be what you cannot see. If you have leafed through Diversity Arts Australia\u2019s report into the state of cultural diversity in Australian arts, media and creative sectors, which was launched on Wednesday, you know that we absolutely cannot see enough diversity in the leadership of our arts, media and creative organisations. The report, entitled Shifting the Balance, is a survey of 200 of Australia\u2019s leading arts and culture organisations: it found that while culturally and linguistically diverse Australians make up 39% of the population, just over half (51%) of the organisations surveyed had no CALD representation at any leadership level. That means more than half of these organisations have no creative directors; no senior executives; no CEOs; no awards judges; no board members; no board chairs or deputy chairs from a migrant background. That is a lot of boardroom tables in the arts and cultural sector without a single seat to represent 39% of the population. It\u2019s shocking \u2013 and, as Prof James Arvanitakis, the chair of Diversity Arts Australia notes, it matters. Media roundup The ABC reports that the personal health information of 317 people applying for Australian visas was accidentally emailed to a member of the public in a bungle that occurred when a spreadsheet was sent to an unknown individual\u2019s email address because of a typo. The Sydney Morning Herald is reporting that the NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, is urging her upper house colleagues to consider amending an abortion bill to ban gender selection as she scrambles to quell anger among conservative MPs. And the Australian reports that India believes the approval of the Adani mine in Queensland has strengthened its trading relationship with Australia. Coming up Scott Morrison is in Tuvalu for the Pacific Islands Forum. A parliamentary inquiry into the impact on security laws on press freedom will resume in Canberra.

He added: \u201cThe more they think there\u2019s a chance that Brexit can be blocked in parliament, the more adamant they are in sticking to their position.\u201d</p> \n<p>In reality, it is Johnson who is refusing to negotiate a deal with the EU unless the 27 member states agree publicly to ditch what he calls the \u201cundemocratic backstop\u201d and provide a new agreement.</p> \n<p>Brussels has said the backstop is an essential component of a deal because it prevents a hard border on the island of Ireland, but critics say it could trap the UK indefinitely in a customs union.</p> \n<p>Speaking during the live stream, Johnson read out a question asking whether he would plan to hold an election in the days after the scheduled Brexit date of 31 October, and declined to rule that out.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think the British public have had a lot of elections and electoral events,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was the election in 2015, the referendum in 2016, another election in 2017.

I never tire of telling you that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do.\u201d</p> \n<p>He claimed to be subjecting himself to a grilling from the public \u201cunpasteurised, unmediated\u201d from his desk in Downing Street, but he was able to choose the questions he answered, including relatively soft ones about what he would do to protect the union and about knife crime, which allowed him to talk about his time as mayor of London.</p>",

The hostile language from Johnson follows an equally robust anonymous briefing against Philip Hammond after he warned against the apparent likelihood of no deal, with No 10 sources accusing the former chancellor of wanting to frustrate Brexit. The Labour MP Stephen Doughty said Johnson was using \u201cthe shameful language of fascism and authoritarianism\u201d. \u201cOur European neighbours are friends not an enemy to \u2018collaborate\u2019 with,\u201d he said. Stephen Gethins, the Scottish National party\u2019s Europe spokesperson, said Johnson was \u201cdangerously deluded and detached from reality in his rhetoric over the UK\u2019s exit from the EU and his \u2018do or die\u2019 plan to crash out without a deal\u201d. A Downing Street source said Johnson had simply been \u201ctrying to make a clear point that the EU is looking at what is happening here and getting the entirely wrong message that parliament is somehow going to block Brexit on 31 October\u201d. During the live stream, Johnson reiterated his argument that the government \u201cdoes not seek no deal, but we need our European friends to compromise\u201d. He added: \u201cThe more they think there\u2019s a chance that Brexit can be blocked in parliament, the more adamant they are in sticking to their position.\u201d In reality, it is Johnson who is refusing to negotiate a deal with the EU unless the 27 member states agree publicly to ditch what he calls the \u201cundemocratic backstop\u201d and provide a new agreement. Brussels has said the backstop is an essential component of a deal because it prevents a hard border on the island of Ireland, but critics say it could trap the UK indefinitely in a customs union. Speaking during the live stream, Johnson read out a question asking whether he would plan to hold an election in the days after the scheduled Brexit date of 31 October, and declined to rule that out. \u201cI think the British public have had a lot of elections and electoral events,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was the election in 2015, the referendum in 2016, another election in 2017. I think what they want us to do is get on and deliver Brexit on 31 October. I never tire of telling you that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do.\u201d He claimed to be subjecting himself to a grilling from the public \u201cunpasteurised, unmediated\u201d from his desk in Downing Street, but he was able to choose the questions he answered, including relatively soft ones about what he would do to protect the union and about knife crime, which allowed him to talk about his time as mayor of London.",

      "bodyText": "A boy born in 2018 in one of the 10% most deprived areas of Scotland will live for 13 years less than a boy from the most affluent areas, according to data published by the National Records of Scotland (NRS). While Scotland continues to have the lowest life expectancy in the UK \u2013 as it has done since the early 1980s \u2013 the figures published on Wednesday suggest that recent improvements have stalled with soaring drug deaths and heart disease to blame. The NRS\u2019s Annual Review of Demographic Trends also shows that, while the mid-2018 population of Scotland had reached a new high \u2013 for the ninth consecutive year \u2013 of an estimated 5,438,100, the country\u2019s birth rate is now the lowest of all UK countries and falling at the fastest rate. There were 51,308 live births registered in 2018, the lowest annual total since 2002 and the second lowest annual total since records began in 1855. Instead, migration continues to be the main driver of Scotland\u2019s population growth, although net migration has decreased over the past two years. The figures are a stark reminder that deprivation has a significant effect on life expectancy, and an even greater one on healthy life expectancy. Girls born between 2015 and 2017 in the 10% most deprived areas in Scotland can expect to live 9.6 years less than those who live in the 10% least deprived areas. Women living in the 10% least deprived areas can expect to spend 23 more years in good health than those in the 10% most deprived areas. For men, the difference in healthy life expectancy is 22.5 years. The head of public health at NHS Scotland, Gerry McCartney, said the stalling of life expectancy improvements in Scotland was a real concern. He said: \u201cThe circumstances in which we live should not impact on health so much that the right to live a long and healthy life is compromised by how much money we have. While the death rate remains largely stable, dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s deaths were three times greater in 2018 than in 2000, making them the second most common cause of death in 2018. The most common cause remains ischaemic heart disease, which is responsible for 11.3% of all deaths. Registrar General for Scotland, Paul Lowe, said: \u201cThis year\u2019s review shows that there have been changes in Scotland\u2019s life expectancy and mortality trends. \u201cLife expectancy in Scotland has been increasing over the long term, but recent estimates indicate that it has stopped improving. \u201cThe largest causes of the stall in life expectancy are the slowing of improvements seen in the reduction of deaths from heart disease and increases in drug related deaths.\u201d",

Steve Smith has a Test average of 35 against orthodox left-arm spin; against any other type of bowling he averages 70. The stat needs to be qualified \u2013 he struggled against the great Sri Lankan Rangana Herath on some viciously turning pitches \u2013 but equally it cannot be ignored. And the disparity is becoming more pronounced: CricViz stats show that, since May 2016, Smith averages 22 against left-arm spin and 96 against the rest.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2019/aug/14/ashes-2019-england-v-australia-second-test-day-one-live\">Ashes 2019: England v Australia second Test, day one washed out \u2013 as it didn't happen</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2>2. <strong>Disrupt his rhythm</strong></h2> \n<p>Smith is such an eccentric, fastidious batsman that many have advocated trying to rip him out of his bubble. There have been many suggestions about how to do this, including bowling the ball earlier than expected, putting a man in his eyeline just off the cut strip or picking a fight with him. The most popular idea is to use more slower balls, particularly early in his innings, in an attempt to disrupt his rhythm.</p> \n<h2>3) <strong>Movement away from the bat</strong></h2> \n<p>Smith was the top-scorer on either side in the last Ashes series to be played in England \u2013 yet he made four consecutive single-figure scores at Edgbaston and Trent Bridge. It is no coincidence that those were the pitches that offered the most seam movement. Smith is most susceptible to the ball moving away from the bat, especially early in his innings, and he was caught in the cordon in all four of these innings.

      "bodyText": "1) Left-arm spin Jack Leach might have played at Lord\u2019s anyway, given Moeen Ali\u2019s loss of confidence, but a stat doing the rounds during the first Test at Edgbaston certainly helped his cause. Steve Smith has a Test average of 35 against orthodox left-arm spin; against any other type of bowling he averages 70. The stat needs to be qualified \u2013 he struggled against the great Sri Lankan Rangana Herath on some viciously turning pitches \u2013 but equally it cannot be ignored. And the disparity is becoming more pronounced: CricViz stats show that, since May 2016, Smith averages 22 against left-arm spin and 96 against the rest. 2. Disrupt his rhythm Smith is such an eccentric, fastidious batsman that many have advocated trying to rip him out of his bubble. There have been many suggestions about how to do this, including bowling the ball earlier than expected, putting a man in his eyeline just off the cut strip or picking a fight with him. The most popular idea is to use more slower balls, particularly early in his innings, in an attempt to disrupt his rhythm. 3) Movement away from the bat Smith was the top-scorer on either side in the last Ashes series to be played in England \u2013 yet he made four consecutive single-figure scores at Edgbaston and Trent Bridge. It is no coincidence that those were the pitches that offered the most seam movement. Smith is most susceptible to the ball moving away from the bat, especially early in his innings, and he was caught in the cordon in all four of these innings. England\u2019s seamers would love to challenge Smith on the green, green grass of home. 4) Patience On Sky Sports on Wednesday morning Shane Warne suggested a two-part plan for Smith. The first was to have a tight leg-side field to keep him on strike, with a few early rib-ticklers to stop him moving across his stumps.

In 2017, then ethics commissioner Mary Dawson found that the prime minister violated the law a year earlier when he took two all-expenses-paid family trips, including a helicopter ride, to a private residence in the Bahamas owned by the Aga Khan.

In the report, independent ethics commissioner Mario Dion said Trudeau and his officials attempted to circumvent, undermine and discredit a decision by federal prosecutors that the firm should face trial on corruption charges. While senior prosecutors sought criminal charges against the company for fraud and bribery in Libya from 2001 to 2011, Trudeau and his team instead lobbied for the deferred prosecution agreement, in essence allowing SNC-Lavalin to pay a fine in lieu of a criminal prosecution, with no ban on bidding for lucrative federal contracts. After Wilson\u2011Raybould refused to overrule the prosecutor\u2019s decision, she was shuffled out of her roles as attorney general and minister of justice. The prime minister has consistently denied any wrongdoing in the affair. Trudeau, who said he was worried about potential job losses should the trial go ahead, admitted he tried to persuade Wilson-Raybould last year to reconsider the decision but insisted he did nothing wrong. Dion disagreed, saying Trudeau had contravened conflict of interest rules forbidding public office holders from trying to improperly further another person\u2019s private interests. \u201cThe evidence showed there were many ways in which Mr Trudeau, either directly or through the actions of those under his direction, sought to influence the attorney general,\u201d Dion wrote. \u201cBecause SNC-Lavalin overwhelmingly stood to benefit from Ms Wilson-Raybould\u2019s intervention, I have no doubt that the result of Mr Trudeau\u2019s influence would have furthered SNC-Lavalin\u2019s interests. The actions that sought to further these interests were improper,\u201d he said in his decision. \u201cThe prime minister, directly and through his senior officials, used various means to exert influence over Ms Wilson\u2011Raybould. The authority of the prime minister and his office was used to circumvent, undermine and ultimately attempt to discredit the decision of the director of public prosecutions as well as the authority of Ms Wilson\u2011Raybould as the crown\u2019s chief law officer,\u201d Dion said. In addition to a fall in the polls for Trudeau, there were several other political casualties of the scandal. Trudeau lost his closest adviser, Gerald Butts, and expelled Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott from the Liberal caucus for their vocal criticism of his handling of the case. Canada\u2019s top civil servant, former privy council clerk Michael Wernick, also resigned. In his report, Dion determined discussions between Trudeau and Wernick over the political fallout of SNC-Lavalin\u2019s prosecution were \u201cimproper\u201d. Dion concluded that Trudeau, in his lobbying of Wilson-Raybould, breached a doctrine aiming to discourage improper political interference of the attorney general by the executive. It is not the first time Trudeau has run afoul of the country\u2019s conflict of interest laws. In 2017, then ethics commissioner Mary Dawson found that the prime minister violated the law a year earlier when he took two all-expenses-paid family trips, including a helicopter ride, to a private residence in the Bahamas owned by the Aga Khan. Trudeau has consistently denied any wrongdoing. The scandal, which has been politically costly for the governing Liberals, had largely faded from view in recent months. But Dion\u2019s findings are likely to reinvigorate criticism of Trudeau by his political rivals. Charlie Angus, a member of the leftwing New Democratic party, who joined initial calls for an ethics investigation, called Dion\u2019s report \u201cdisturbing\u201d and Trudeau\u2019s actions \u201cunacceptable\u201d. To blunt Dion\u2019s findings, Trudeau is expected to release a report by former Liberal cabinet member Anne McLellan on the SNC-Lavalin affair, which the prime minister described earlier as \u201cgreat\u201d. But Dion\u2019s findings, released two months before the federal election, are likely to reinvigorate criticism of Trudeau by other party leaders. \u201cThis is a bombshell report,\u201d said Jagmeet Singh, the leader of the leftwing New Democratic party, adding that Trudeau\u2019s actions were outrageous and unacceptable. The Conservative party leader, Andrew Scheer, who is jockeying with Trudeau as frontrunner in the polls, described his actions as \u201cunforgivable\u201d. \u201cHe has used the power of his office to enrich himself, to reward himself and to punish his critics,\u201d said Scheer.",

Toxicology tests on the Cardiff City footballer found levels of carboxyhaemoglobin \u2013 formed in the blood when exposed to carbon monoxide (CO) \u2013 above the point doctors consider to be fatal.

The Telegraph reported that Labour\u2019s John Mann was a <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/08/05/30-labour-mps-prepared-vote-brexit-deal-boris-johnson-secures/\">\u201cgo-between\u201d with the government</a> and some of those potentially willing to vote for a withdrawal deal.</p> <p>\u201cI think Boris will present a deal to parliament, roll something in glitter and get themselves over the line and a number of my colleagues would vote for that deal at that point,\u201d one MP said. \u201cMany of them are at a point now where they will take whatever is on the table, a second referendum is so divisive and no deal is so damaging.\u201d</p> <p>It is understood at least one Labour MP has consulted the House of Commons clerks about whether a backbencher could table something like an amendment to a motion that endorses the withdrawal agreement, by setting aside the requirement for parliament to agree the deal.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/13/tom-watson-urges-labour-to-work-with-liberal-democrats\">Tom Watson urges Labour to work with Lib Dems to stop no-deal Brexit</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is unclear however, whether Tory MPs would be whipped to accept the previous deal in such circumstances, given how Johnson has railed against \u201cthe undemocratic backstop\u201d.</p> <p>Snell, who has abstained or opposed several motions designed to delay Brexit, said he and many other Labour MPs wanted the opportunity to vote for a deal, that he regretted not doing so in the spring and hoped Johnson would present a deal to parliament.</p> <p>He said, however, that he would be prepared to give efforts to stop no deal a reasonable chance. \u201cI want to stop no deal. My preference is still a deal but no deal would destroy Stoke.

      "bodyText": "Labour MPs opposed to a second referendum are considering a \u201cradical and dramatic intervention\u201d to make clear to Jeremy Corbyn and Boris Johnson they are prepared to vote for a Brexit deal, with one estimating that dozens of colleagues are now ready to back the withdrawal agreement. Stephen Kinnock, the Labour MP who coordinates around 30 MPs in a group called Respect the Result, said he believed that passing the withdrawal agreement was the most certain way of stopping the UK crashing out without a deal. Kinnock, who had been urging Corbyn to do a deal with Theresa May in cross-party talks, said there was an increasing feeling among many of his colleagues opposed to a second referendum that passing the withdrawal agreement bill was the best option. Despite Johnson\u2019s refusal to negotiate with the EU unless it drops the backstop, Kinnock said a time would come in the autumn when a compromise deal could be done based on the withdrawal agreement that emerged out of cross-party talks. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to make a radical and dramatic intervention,\u201d he said. \u201cIf enough of us do then it\u2019s up to Boris Johnson to see where he goes from there. It means a large number of us going to see Jeremy and trying as hard as we possibly can telling him to make that big, bold offer, to face down the second referendum campaign and say there\u2019s no time for that. We\u2019ve got to get this deal over the line. \u201cAnd by the way, if it is the second referendum that you want then the only way you\u2019re going to get it through a parliamentary route is having the opportunity to debate and vote on it at committee stage. \u201cIf that doesn\u2019t work then it\u2019s perhaps a joint statement, a public gesture that says here are the 50 Labour MPs that would vote for this. You need to get 260 of your guys to vote for it and we can get it over the line. Then it\u2019s a question of whether he can deliver it. I think Boris Johnson could lose about 50 of the hardliners. But I think he could gain 50 on our side.\u201d Kinnock said he believed a deal could potentially happen after MPs had tried to block no deal without cast-iron success. \u201cOnce it\u2019s clear there is no parliamentary or legislative route to preventing no deal then the [withdrawal agreement bill] is the only game in town,\u201d he said. A number of Labour MPs, including Sarah Champion, Gareth Snell and Melanie Onn, have suggested they could now be prepare to back a deal in some circumstances, particularly if faced with the possibility of no deal. The Telegraph reported that Labour\u2019s John Mann was a \u201cgo-between\u201d with the government and some of those potentially willing to vote for a withdrawal deal. \u201cI think Boris will present a deal to parliament, roll something in glitter and get themselves over the line and a number of my colleagues would vote for that deal at that point,\u201d one MP said. \u201cMany of them are at a point now where they will take whatever is on the table, a second referendum is so divisive and no deal is so damaging.\u201d It is understood at least one Labour MP has consulted the House of Commons clerks about whether a backbencher could table something like an amendment to a motion that endorses the withdrawal agreement, by setting aside the requirement for parliament to agree the deal. It is unclear however, whether Tory MPs would be whipped to accept the previous deal in such circumstances, given how Johnson has railed against \u201cthe undemocratic backstop\u201d. Snell, who has abstained or opposed several motions designed to delay Brexit, said he and many other Labour MPs wanted the opportunity to vote for a deal, that he regretted not doing so in the spring and hoped Johnson would present a deal to parliament. He said, however, that he would be prepared to give efforts to stop no deal a reasonable chance. \u201cI want to stop no deal. My preference is still a deal but no deal would destroy Stoke. So I would grit my teeth and vote for mechanisms to stop no deal, but I want to know what they are working towards,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople asking us to vote to stop no deal cannot ask us to keep doing it blindly for every madcap scheme.\u201d Snell said he was concerned Johnson would not respect the views or mandate of parliament in the way Theresa May had done. Government sources have suggested they believe that even if Johnson was compelled to request an extension, there would be no way MPs could force him to do so. \u201cYes, you can pass a bill to mandate the PM to ask for an extension to article 50 but you cannot legislate for sincerity. We could compel Boris Johnson to ask for an extension but we cannot stop him making it impossible for the EU to grant one,\u201d Snell said. Some MPs remain sceptical about parliamentary devices designed to delay Brexit in order to prevent no deal. The former Labour MP Ian Austin, who voted for May\u2019s deal and later quit the party over its antisemitism crisis, said MPs would only be delaying an inevitable choice. \u201cI voted for a deal because I thought it was the best way of avoiding no deal and because the only result of Theresa May having to leave was a harder Brexit,\u201d Austin said. \u201cThis is displacement activity. People can pretend there is a clever procedural device that makes it all go away, but in the end they are going to have to face up to their responsibilities and make a decision. They need to understand that there isn\u2019t some parliamentary device that means they can keep avoiding the question.\u201d The move by the Labour MPs comes as the Unite leader Len McCluskey said Labour must support a pragmatic Brexit deal, arguing it appeared to be impossible to stop no deal and that there was no path to a second referendum. The trade union boss, a key ally of Corbyn, said Labour had to address how it would approach negotiating future trade deals if the UK had left the EU after Labour came to power. Senior figures from other trade unions privately expressed disappointment at McCluskey\u2019s intervention, with one saying it was not sticking to the \u201cagreed position\u201d and it sounded like he had \u201cspoken out of turn again\u201d.",

The data also makes clear that until underemployment levels fall significantly, the prospects of wages growth as predicted in the April budget above 3% are nonexistent. There was a little bit of good news for some workers\u2019 pay packets in the past three month. Public sector workers look to have done very well \u2013 an overall average growth of 0.8% in seasonally adjusted terms in the June quarter \u2013 the best for five years and well above the 0.5% growth of private sector workers: But as the ABS chief economist, Bruce Hockman, noted, that was mostly due to \u201cthe healthcare and social assistance industry, where a number of large increases were recorded in Victoria under a plan to ensure wage parity with other states\u201d. And when we look at public and private sector wage rises in June across each state, it is clear the jump for public sector workers in Victoria was very much the exception, and in New South Wales, Western Australia, Tasmania and the Northern Territory, private sector workers actually had stronger wage growth than workers in the public sector: In such cases it is best to look at the annual trend figures which wash out such one-off rises. Here, the picture is clear that while private sector wage growth of 2.3% is above the record lows of early 2017, there has been a distinct halt in the improvement. From September 2017 to December 2018, annual growth rose 0.43% points from 1.86% to 2.29%.

Wages have never grown by less than 1.6%, so when inflation is that low, it is almost impossible not to have some real wage growth. The real aim for long-term real-wage growth is for rises above 3% \u2013 something that neither private nor public sector workers have experienced since early 2013. Given that is now more than six years ago, it is hard not to agree with the statements by the head of the Reserve Bank, Philip Lowe, last week in his testimony before the House economics committee, that workers have experienced low wages growth for so long that their expectations on what is normal have also been lowered. The figures also highlight the shift of the Phillips curve \u2013 which compares wages growth with unemployment. In the past, the current unemployment rate of 5.2% would have seen wages growing at around 3.75% rather than the current 2.3%: It appears the relationship between unemployment and wages still holds but such has been the shift in the curve that it now seems that to get wages growth of around 3.75%, we would need an unemployment rate of below 4%. There does, however, still appear to be a very strong relationship between wages growth and underemployment. The current rate of 2.3% wages growth is bang on where you would expect it to be given the current underemployment rate of 8.3%: What this suggests is that for wages growth to get to the government\u2019s hope of 2.75% by next year and 3.25% the year after, the underemployment rate would need to fall to 7.7% and then 7.2%. That is the equivalent of 80,000 fewer underemployed by June next year and 150,000 fewer by June 2021. That would be wonderful to see but it remains a big ask. The last time the underemployment rate was 7.2% was more than six years ago. And to get to that level requires a fall of 1.1% points. During the mining boom it took four years to fall by the amount.

If you have leafed through Diversity Arts Australia\u2019s report into the state of cultural diversity in Australian arts, media and creative sectors, which was launched on Wednesday, you know that we absolutely cannot see enough diversity in the leadership of our arts, media and creative organisations. What we can see clearly, though, is the necessity of this research and its findings. The report, titled Shifting the Balance, is a survey of 200 of Australia\u2019s leading arts and culture organisations, government and funding bodies, festivals and prize panels. It found that culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) Australians are underrepresented at the leadership level of every single sector. CALD Australians make up 39% of the population, but according to the report, just over half (51%) of the organisations surveyed had no CALD representation at any leadership level. ZERO. That means more than half of these organisations have no creative directors; no senior executives; no CEOs; no awards judges; no board members; no board chairs or deputy chairs from a migrant background. That is a lot of boardroom tables in the arts and cultural sector without a single seat to represent 39% of the population. It\u2019s shocking \u2013 and, as Professor James Arvanitakis, the chair of Diversity Arts Australia notes, it matters. \u201cAs one of the main expressions of our cultural life, the creative sector plays a crucial role in crafting how we see ourselves \u2013 the things we consider \u2018Australian\u2019 and the things we consider \u2018other\u2019,\u201d Arvanitakis says in the report. \u201cWe look to our artists, writers, producers and performers to help us define ourselves and to investigate and express our identities.

In 2017 I made two seasons of a podcast called It\u2019s Not A Race. Among my goals were to bring the authority and stories of Indigenous people and people of colour to the centre, and to assess the state of conversations about race and identity we were having in Australia. In my current ABC radio show Stop Everything! we try to tackle conversations on race, representation and \u201cdiversity\u201d (a word that I have a very ambivalent relationship with) through the prism of popular culture. A few weeks ago, minutes before going live, I went to fill my cup at the water cooler next to the studio. To get there, I wove past former breakfast television host Karl Stefanovic. A flashy personality in the drab corridors of the national broadcaster! It was a dissonant to see him in that context, but there he was.

The disparity outlined by the Shifting the Balance report becomes particularly grave when you consider how broadly \u201cCALD\u201d is defined \u2013 a problem which Diversity Arts Australia acknowledge within the body of their report. Here\u2019s the definition: \u201cPeople who are first, second or third generation migrants or members of ethnic communities.

Guardian Australia has seen emails from at least two program facilitators to farmers and others, encouraging them to attend the Ridd lectures.</p> <p>The Queensland environment minister, Leeanne Enoch, told Guardian Australia: \u201cThere is a clear expectation that the organisation uses that taxpayer funding for its stated purpose.\u201d</p> <p>Enoch said science had \u201ccome under attack for political purposes\u201d and pointed to a Liberal National party <a href=\"https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/national/queensland/queensland-opposition-to-consider-establishing-science-review-office-20190714-p52738.html\">suggestion that the state establish a scientific review office</a>, prompted partly by unhappiness about the scientific consensus that agriculture is harming the reef.</p> <p>\u201cThis office of \u2018alternative facts\u2019 would be used to undermine science in this state,\u201d Enoch said.</p> <p>\u201cFor the last decade, the Queensland government has supported agricultural industries to voluntarily improve their practices. However, uptake has not been fast enough, so water quality has continued to decline.\u201d</p> <p> WWF-Australia said the attacks on reef science were hypocritical and damaging to the sugar industry.</p> <p>\u201cOver the past decade, tens of millions in taxpayers\u2019 money have supported many cane farmers to reduce excess fertiliser, pesticides and sediment in runoff, including projects managed by Canegrowers,\u201d said Dermot O\u2019Gorman, WWF-Australia chief executive.</p> <p>\u201cNow Canegrowers seek to denigrate the very science that delivered public financial assistance to increase farm efficiency and productivity.\u201d</p> <p>Guardian Australia has spoken to several cane farmers and other industry stakeholders who say they\u2019re embarrassed by the nature of the debate, which has been skewed by certain district branches\u2019 embrace of contrarian science.</p> <p>Comparisons have been made with <a href=\"https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/mps-answer-call-to-arms-on-health-of-barrier-reef/news-story/7b760df5f5af9244e1826944f042a9eb\">Adani</a>, and opponents of reef regulations appear intent on following Adani\u2019s aggressive campaign strategy, which sought to undermine the Queensland Labor government\u2019s standing in regional areas.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to oppose regulations because they would have a bad impact on growers, that\u2019s fair enough, that\u2019s what those groups are supposed to do,\u201d one farmer said. \u201cBut to then turn around and say, after years of trying to get people on board, to say we don\u2019t believe the science any more \u2013it\u2019s just not being straight up.\u201d</p> <p>Another industry worker said: \u201cWe receive a lot of federal and state money through to promote engagement and extension \u2026 and then play a double game by promoting \u2018the other side of the story\u2019 and \u2026 possibly undermining all the hard work we have achieved with some growers.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier this year Canegrowers was handed one of the first grants awarded by the Great Barrier Reef Foundation\u2019s partnership with the federal government, for a behavioural management program called \u201cCane Changer\u201d.

Peter Ridd began a speaking tour of regional Queensland on Monday amid fierce opposition to proposed state regulations that would set restrictions for sediment and chemical runoff from farms into reef catchments. His lectures \u2013 which dispute the overwhelming consensus of reef scientists \u2013 argue that pollution from farmland is not seriously damaging the reef. The events are hosted by regional branches of the sugar cane growers peak body, Canegrowers, and the Australian Environment Foundation, a charity set up by the rightwing thinktank the Institute of Public Affairs, and with strong links to the agriculture and fossil fuel industries. The new regulations were announced by the Queensland government in February, partly because of an ongoing lack of farmers taking part in voluntary \u201cbest management practice\u201d (BMP) programs, which offer incentives to improve practices. The state provides funding for the Canegrowers organisation to run its own version \u2013 called \u201cSmartcane BMP\u201d \u2013 and pays for the positions of more than a dozen BMP facilitators to assist farmers with water quality practices and encourage them to participate. Guardian Australia has seen emails from at least two program facilitators to farmers and others, encouraging them to attend the Ridd lectures. The Queensland environment minister, Leeanne Enoch, told Guardian Australia: \u201cThere is a clear expectation that the organisation uses that taxpayer funding for its stated purpose.\u201d Enoch said science had \u201ccome under attack for political purposes\u201d and pointed to a Liberal National party suggestion that the state establish a scientific review office, prompted partly by unhappiness about the scientific consensus that agriculture is harming the reef. \u201cThis office of \u2018alternative facts\u2019 would be used to undermine science in this state,\u201d Enoch said. \u201cFor the last decade, the Queensland government has supported agricultural industries to voluntarily improve their practices. However, uptake has not been fast enough, so water quality has continued to decline.\u201d WWF-Australia said the attacks on reef science were hypocritical and damaging to the sugar industry. \u201cOver the past decade, tens of millions in taxpayers\u2019 money have supported many cane farmers to reduce excess fertiliser, pesticides and sediment in runoff, including projects managed by Canegrowers,\u201d said Dermot O\u2019Gorman, WWF-Australia chief executive. \u201cNow Canegrowers seek to denigrate the very science that delivered public financial assistance to increase farm efficiency and productivity.\u201d Guardian Australia has spoken to several cane farmers and other industry stakeholders who say they\u2019re embarrassed by the nature of the debate, which has been skewed by certain district branches\u2019 embrace of contrarian science. Comparisons have been made with Adani, and opponents of reef regulations appear intent on following Adani\u2019s aggressive campaign strategy, which sought to undermine the Queensland Labor government\u2019s standing in regional areas. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to oppose regulations because they would have a bad impact on growers, that\u2019s fair enough, that\u2019s what those groups are supposed to do,\u201d one farmer said. \u201cBut to then turn around and say, after years of trying to get people on board, to say we don\u2019t believe the science any more \u2013it\u2019s just not being straight up.\u201d Another industry worker said: \u201cWe receive a lot of federal and state money through to promote engagement and extension \u2026 and then play a double game by promoting \u2018the other side of the story\u2019 and \u2026 possibly undermining all the hard work we have achieved with some growers.\u201d Earlier this year Canegrowers was handed one of the first grants awarded by the Great Barrier Reef Foundation\u2019s partnership with the federal government, for a behavioural management program called \u201cCane Changer\u201d. The $1.4m grant aims to help promote best management practice and to improve uptake. Canegrowers said in a statement it believed provisions in the new reef regulations \u2013 which include variable runoff load limits \u2013 would act as a disincentive to growers continuing to engage with BMP programs, but that the organisation \u201cremain(s) committed to managing the impact of farming on the waterways that feed into the Great Barrier Reef\u201d. \u201cGrowers are being asked to operate under policies and laws that governments tell us are formulated and guided on the basis of science. So naturally, growers have a keen interest in the science and in any concerns or discrepancies around it particularly where it is used to justify regulation on their activities. \u201cAll government grants provided to Canegrowers or to any district organisation require regular financial reports to the relevant government department, as well as annual financial audits by an independent auditor.\u201d Ridd\u2019s lectures are being hosted by local district branches, and Canegrowers could not say what assistance or funding any district had provided. The Bundaberg district has been among most vocal in supporting Ridd. Local representative Allan Dingle has said the event would \u201cset the record straight\u201d and end \u201cunsubstantiated scaremongering\u201d about the reef. The local News Corp-owned paper, the Bundaberg News-Mail, last week published a full page of Ridd\u2019s claims without critique or context. For context, Dr Jon Brodie, a water quality expert at the ARC Centre for Coral Reef Studies at James Cook University in Townsville \u2013 the same university ruled to have unlawfully dismissed Ridd last year \u2013 said the controversial academic\u2019s views were at odds with hundreds of experts in the scientific community. \u201cThey\u2019re not supported by any other scientist we can think of. On one side we have hundreds of scientists from dozens of institutions in Australia and overseas, lots of universities involved in this work publishing thousands of peer-reviewed papers, brought together in the consensus statement [in 2017],\u201d Brodie said. On Wednesday, the Australian Coral Reef Society released a statement saying it was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d about Ridd\u2019s lecture tour, and provided a detailed scientific response to claims he has made. Brodie said efforts to improve reef water quality had started \u201cplateauing\u201d, and that two landmark reports \u2013 updates to the reef water quality report card and a major outlook report \u2013 were expected to be released in the coming months. Enoch said the regulations were formulated in response to the recommendations of a 2016 Great Barrier Reef Water Science Taskforce, and that they were based on the 2017 consensus statement.",

      "bodyText": "A business case for the controversial $500m Broken Hill pipeline, released after a three-year battle, reveals the New South Wales government made almost no effort to evaluate the impacts of the pipeline on the lower Darling and instead put weight on how the pipeline would help the cotton industry upstream and mining ventures along the pipeline route. The 2016 report, which had been kept secret until this week, will add to pressure on the government to respond to the findings of the Natural Resources Commission that water-sharing rules for the Barwon-Darling system in northern NSW are responsible for the environmental catastrophe at Menindee and a drought three years early in the lower Darling. The NRC has called for an immediate overhaul of the water-sharing rules to make them fairer. It says the rules have allowed irrigators to take huge volumes from the river including during low flows, at the expense of other users of the river, including the Indigenous people. The unfair rules have led to prolonged periods of no flows in the lower reaches of the Darling and towns now facing extreme water shortages, it says. These have led to unprecedented fish kills at Menindee last summer and more are expected as the weather warms. The $500m Broken Hill pipeline to bring water from the Murray 270km away instead of drawing from Menindee Lakes 100km away has now been built, but independent MP Justin Field, who secured the release of the business case, said it showed the crisis had been \u201cmanufactured.\u201d \u201cThe reality is that Broken Hill didn\u2019t have a water security problem until upstream irrigators were allowed by the NSW government to suck the river system,\u201d he said. \u201cThis pipeline allows that unsustainable water use to continue and risks the long-term health of the river and the Menindee Lakes.\u201d The final business case reveals that a far more complex set of considerations other than water security for Broken Hill drove the decision. Front of mind for for the Department of Primary Industries, the author of the report, was facilitating what is known as the Menindee Lakes water saving project. It is designed to deliver 50GL of water savings through shrinking the lakes and cutting evaporation. If NSW can meet its contribution to water savings this way, it takes the pressure off irrigators, mainly cotton growers, upstream to surrender water entitlements to the government. The report, which was written before ABC\u2019s Four Corners blew the whistle on allegations of water theft by irrigators, shows unequivocally that the pipeline project business case did not consider what the environmental impact of the entire scheme- the pipeline and running the lakes dry \u2013 would be on the lower Darling. It said the environmental issues would be canvassed later, while also being very critical of the environmental impact of the cheaper alternative: taking water out of the nearby Talyawalka aquifer to supplement the lake supply. Since the business case was written, the Murray-Darling Basin Authority has examined the impact of shrinking the lakes and has flagged environmental concerns. The business case instead concentrated on the economic benefits of both the pipeline and the associated water-saving scheme for Menindee. \u201cThe economic benefit of the additional 50GL of SDL offset savings under option 1a and 1b [the pipeline options] would add an estimated economic surplus to the state of $4.6m,\u201d the report says. \u201cThe value of this water to production is significantly more with the Cotton Growers Association estimating that the economic contribution of 50 GL of water could be more that $120m to agricultural output.\u201d At another point it notes that mining near Broken Hill uses 50% of the potable water supplied to the region. \u201cFor mining companies, scarce water availability may eventual require the mines to become wholly self-sufficient which will require additional investment and approvals placing additional pressure on the viability of the region\u2019s primary industry,\u201d it says. There was virtually no analysis of the negative economic on tourism of shrinking the Menindee lakes, or of the impact on downstream farms. \u201cThe business case shows what many in the Broken Hill community who were opposed to the pipeline long suspected, that decoupling Broken Hill\u2019s water supply from the Menindee Lakes would reduce the need for flows down the Darling and open up more water for northern irrigators,\u201d Field said. \u201cThe government couldn\u2019t be clearer, under Summary of Benefits of the Business Case, the first benefit listed is: \u2018avoided costs of water embargoes on Northern Rivers irrigators (ie. loss cotton production)\u2019.\u201d Elsewhere in the business case it says: \u201cUltimately, the State\u2019s ability to manage environmental, agricultural and industry water requirements within the Basin is limited by Broken Hill\u2019s reliance on the Menindee Lakes system.\u201d",

Maxwell also spent much of his oration on a recent decision of the high court, Asic v Kobelt, in which it decided, by a four to three margin, that a man who ran a shop in a remote Aboriginal community did not engage in unconscionable conduct. The shopkeeper gave his customers credit for purchases, and took their bank details and pin numbers. On pay day, he drained their accounts of most or all of their money. Regulators and consumer groups were outraged by the decision, with the Consumer Action Law Centre saying it proved the law was \u201cnot working\u201d. Asked by the Guardian what would constitute unconscionable conduct given the behaviour in the Kobelt case failed to meet the test, Maxwell stopped short of criticising the high court. \u201cI would have had my own view,\u201d he said. Maxwell traced the history of the rule against unconscionable conduct back to the development of the law of equity in the 15th century. He said last year\u2019s banking royal commission, which heard tale after tale of customers being ripped off by financial institutions, suggested there was not much moral reasoning going on in the financial services sector. \u201cEquity\u2019s moral aspirations seem to remain largely unfulfilled,\u201d he said. He said judges were \u201cconstantly called on to perform the role of moral arbiter\u201d, including when sentencing criminal offenders, and seeing them do so helped the community have confidence that they were not out of touch. \u201cThat judgment has a direct bearing on the size of the fine or more often the length of the prison term,\u201d he said.",

It found inhaled fibres were present in cancerous lung specimens and concluded: \u201cThese bioresistant and biopersistent plastic fibres are candidate agents contributing to the risk of lung cancer.\u201d The European commission\u2019s chief scientific advisers said in a report in April: \u201cThe evidence [on the environmental and health risks of microplastics] provides grounds for genuine concern and for precaution to be exercised.\u201d Scientists not involved in the latest study expressed concern that supposedly pristine ecosystems such as the Arctic were contaminated. \u201cThe work is very important because it strengthens the argument for much more stringent regulations on the plastics industry and forcing the governments of the world to address the issue of plastic pollution,\u201d said Steve Allen, at the EcoLab research institute in France. \u201cWith [microplastics] pouring into our environment, it is highly likely we will only find out the safe levels after we have exceeded them.\u201d An earlier study published by Allen in April found significant microplastic quantities falling from the air in the Pyrenees, also implicating wind as a transport mechanism. The Bergmann-led research, however, is the first to look the contamination of snow. Just two previous studies have looked at the presence of microplastics in the air, one in Paris, France, and another in Dongguan, China. Both found a steady fall of particles. Other recent research has found microplastics raining down on the Rockies in North America and in farmland soils near Shanghai in China.",

England had not even confirmed he was playing when they wrote those odds up on the whiteboard. It is a lot to load on to a 24-year-old who is playing his first Test after three years of first-class cricket. But no more, perhaps, than Archer expects of himself.

      "bodyText": "Some summer\u2019s day was this. After six hours of rain play was abandoned for the day at 4.15pm. There was not so much as a coin toss, let alone a ball bowled. There was a brief let-up after lunch, a lull between showers, when everyone got out on the field and pretended they had not seen the forecast for the rest of the afternoon. It lasted just long enough for Chris Jordan to present Jofra Archer with his England cap. Then it started raining again. There was a hint, too, for those watching closely, that England plan to stick with Joe Denly rather than pick Sam Curran, who was fielding at slip while the other bowlers got busy warming up. Australia confirmed their own team changes. They have brought in Josh Hazlewood for James Pattinson, which means that Mitchell Starc has been rested again. Justin Langer said it was all to do with their bowling strategy. \u201cHe hits a great length and he\u2019s usually pretty miserly with his economy rate,\u201d Langer said. \u201cThat\u2019s what gives him the edge in this game.\u201d If Australia have brought in Hazlewood to try to bore out England\u2019s batsmen, England have brought in Archer to try to blast out Australia\u2019s. But then, given Steve Smith\u2019s appetite for batting, they are never going to beat him in a game of patience. Over at the bookies\u2019 tent at the back of the Nursery Ground they were running a special on whether and when England will be able to get Smith out again, with Archer the 3-1 favourite to take his wicket in the first innings. England had not even confirmed he was playing when they wrote those odds up on the whiteboard. It is a lot to load on to a 24-year-old who is playing his first Test after three years of first-class cricket. But no more, perhaps, than Archer expects of himself. The story goes that he was so sure he would make his debut here that he asked the management to arrange for Jordan to be here too. The two of them are best friends. \u201cApart from receiving my first England cap, this is easily one of my proudest moments,\u201d Jordan told Archer in the huddle. \u201cEvery single challenge that\u2019s presented itself to you so far, you\u2019ve found a way of rising to it, and I don\u2019t see Test cricket being any different. \u201cYou\u2019ve had a taste in the shorter formats, been in the World Cup, travelled the world in various leagues and dominated, but I know this is the pinnacle for you. One of the first things you said to me when you came over to England was that you wanted to play Test cricket for England and that time has come. You\u2019ve crossed that line.\u201d Earlier in the afternoon they ran the highlights of the World Cup final on the big screens and the empty stands echoed with the commentators\u2019 screams and shouts during that wild final over Archer bowled. It was exactly a month ago and it seems both so long ago and yet no time at all. It is an open secret that the World Cup has taken a lot out of some of the players in this England team, that the turnaround was too quick for the players to be at their best in that first Test at Edgbaston. The management are hoping it will work the other way for Archer, that freshened by a short break he will be coming into this series flush with confidence, in the form of his young life. The highlights were better than anything else there was to watch. Some of the old hands in the crowd beat an early retreat to St John\u2019s Wood High Street, reckoning, rightly, that the best way to spend the day was to hole up somewhere and have a long lunch. Thousands more milled around the ground, huddled up in the lower tiers, or under umbrellas or the lee of the stands, waiting on announcements over the PA or watching the groundstaff hokey-cokey the covers. There should be more to see on Thursday, at least. This is a four-day Test now, which means the follow-on has been cut to 150 runs but, as Langer said, it should not make too much difference. \u201cThere\u2019s plenty of time,\u201d he said.

      "bodyText": "A senior Conservative MP has raised the idea that Boris Johnson could unilaterally withdraw the UK from the European Union in the next 10 days to try to avoid attempts by parliament to block a no-deal Brexit. Tom Tugendhat, who chairs the Commons foreign affairs committee, put forward a possible chronology of a unilateral withdrawal by 24 August followed by an immediate general election, with the Irish border issue then solved by a Northern Ireland-only backstop. A Downing Street source said the idea was not under consideration, and one expert in EU law said the withdrawal date could only be changed with the consent of Brussels. The plan, if carried out, would be hugely controversial, and would take companies and the financial markets by surprise before no-deal preparations had been completed. However, Tugendhat, the MP for Tonbridge and Malling, is a respected and well connected backbencher. He was among 20 Conservative MPs, alongside the former chancellor Philip Hammond, who have written to Johnson accusing him of setting the bar too high in negotiations with the EU to have a hope of getting changes to a deal. In a tweet, Tugendhat asked: In response to tweeted questions about the repeated objections by the Democratic Unionist party to any regulatory provision that applied only to Northern Ireland, Tugendhat argued that a Johnson government could ignore this if it won a majority in the subsequent election, and that a referendum would give the idea credibility. Such a plan, particularly the idea of unilateral withdrawal without any warning followed by an immediate election, would seem hugely politically risky, and could prompt a furious reaction from MPs, businesses and many members of the public. However, No 10 is known to be concerned that the Commons could find a way to block Johnson\u2019s much-promised departure by 31 October if it involved leaving the EU without a deal, whether through taking control of the parliamentary order paper or means such as a no-confidence vote in the government. Steve Peers, a professor of EU law at the University of Essex, said he did not think such a plan was feasible. While changing the date of withdrawal could be done via so-called secondary legislation, not voted on by MPs, he tweeted, the EU Withdrawal Act states it must happen \u201cin accordance with article 50(3) of the Treaty on European Union\u201d, which sets out the EU\u2019s constitutional basis. Section 50(3) of the treaty says an extension to the standard two-year wait for departure under article 50 can only take place if \u201cthe European council, in agreement with the member state concerned, unanimously decides to extend this period\u201d. This indicated any change of date would need agreement, he said. Peers wrote: \u201cSo the EU would have to agree to change the date. \u2018Unilateral\u2019 change of date is therefore illegal.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "All climbers seeking a permit for Everest must have prior high altitude mountaineering experience and demonstrable training, a high-level commission for the Nepalese government has ruled. The recommendation was issued by the body charged with looking at the issue of high-altitude safety after one of the deadliest seasons in recent years on Everest, which was blamed on inexperience and crowding near the summit. Eleven climbers were killed or went missing on the 8,850-metre (29,035 ft) mountain in May, nine on the Nepalese side and two on the Tibetan side. The Nepalese panel - made up of government officials, climbing experts and agencies representing the climbing community - was set up after climbers and guides criticised officials for allowing anyone who paid $11,000 (\u00a39,000) to attempt to climb Everest. Some veteran guiding companies had long warned of the dangerous consequences of inexperience and crowds on the summit slopes. \u201cClimbers to [Everest] and other 8,000-metre mountains must undergo basic and high altitude climbing training,\u201d the panel said in the report it submitted to the government. It said that those hoping to climb Everest must have climbed at least one Nepalese peak of more than 6,500-metres21,325 ft) before getting a permit. Climbers must also submit a certificate of good health and physical fitness and be accompanied by a trained Nepalese guide. Mira Acharya, a member of the panel, said: \u201cClimbers died due to altitude sickness, heart attack, exhaustion or weaknesses, and not due to traffic jams\u201d. She said the compulsory provision of guides for each climber was to discourage solo attempts, which put lives at risk. Nepal is home to eight of the world\u2019s 14 highest mountains, and mountain climbing is a key source of employment and income for the poor nation. The numbers attempting the climb in May led to bottlenecks in the \u201cdeath zone\u201d, where very low oxygen levels put lives at risk. Oxygen cylinders ran out while as many as 100 people waited in the queue. The issues were underlined by Simon Lowe, the managing director of UK-based Jagged Globe, who said this year\u2019s crowding had aggravated an underlying issue of lack of experience. \u201cThat is incompetent climbers being led by incompetent teams,\u201d Lowe said. \u201cIf you go up with a bare minimum bottles of supplementary oxygen and stand in a queue for ages that is going to cause problems.\u201d Without reforms such as those suggested by the panel, Lowe said guiding on the mountain by responsible companies could become untenable. Nepal issued 381 permits for Everest for this year\u2019s climbing season, which tends to culminate in May, when the daylight and weather are the most forgiving. Ghanshyam Upadhyaya, a senior tourism ministry official, said the recommendations would be implemented. \u201cThe government will now make the required changes in laws and regulations guiding mountain climbing,\u201d he told Reuters.",

Maturity is when the government repays the debt at the end of the term. When more investors are buying government bonds prices go up, and yields drop.</p>\n    <p>Companies can also issue bonds.</p>\n    <p><b>What happens when the yield curve inverts?</b></p>\n    <p>This is when the yield on short-term bonds is higher than on long-term bonds. It means that traders are accepting a lower interest rate to hold longer-dated bonds than the shorter-dated alternative.</p>\n    <p>It\u2019s relatively rare \u2013 investors typically get higher returns for lending over the long term, as this is seen as riskier than short-term lending. They also expect to be compensated for the impact of inflation, which will eat into investments over time.</p>\n    <p><b>What does it mean?</b></p>\n    <p>An inverted yield curve is a classic signal of a looming recession \u2013 in the US, the curve has inverted ahead of every recession over the past 50 years. It falsely signalled a recession just once, at the time of the 1998 Russian financial crisis.</p>\n    <p>For other countries the signal is less clear. Several have experienced long periods of inverted yield curves without a subsequent recession, notably the UK in the 1990s.</p>\n    <p><b>Why is it happening now?</b></p>\n    <p>The yield curve for two- to 10-year US government bonds <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2019/aug/14/germany-economy-shrinks-gdp-recession-uk-inflation-stock-markets-business-live\">has inverted for the first time since 2007</a>, just before the start of the global financial crisis. This indicates that investors are seriously worried about an economic downturn, which would keep inflation low. They are worried about the impact on the already-weak global economy of the prolonged trade war between the US and China, along with Brexit.</p>\n    <p><b>Is recession inevitable?</b></p>\n    <p>No, but it is highly likely. And an inverted yield curve driven by recession fears risks becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy, knocking confidence and causing businesses to cut back on investment.</p>\n    <p><b>How soon does recession tend to follow yield curve inversion?</b></p>\n    <p>Previous downturns show that yields have typically inverted 18 months, on average, before a recession began. <b>Julia Kollewe</b></p>\n    <p><br></p>\n    <p><br></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>China\u2019s industrial production hit a 17-year low while the growth in retail sales across the world\u2019s second largest economy proved to be lower than expected.</p> \n<p>Berlin reported that the German economy, the world\u2019s fourth largest after Japan, contracted by 0.1% in the second quarter of the year, halving the growth rate of the 19-member eurozone currency bloc from 0.4% in the previous quarter to 0.2%.</p> \n<p>Fiona Cincotta, senior analyst at the spreadbetting firm City Index, said fears of a global downturn were stalking the markets. \u201cDoom and gloom dominated after data showed that Chinese industrial output grew at the slowest pace in 17 years, whilst the German economy contracted.</p> \n<p>\u201cRecession warning bells rang out across the markets as Trump\u2019s delaying of tariffs on some Chinese imports is a case of too little too latte \u2013 the damage to economies has already been done,\u201d she said.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/08/globalisation-not-survive-trump-markets-new-world-order\">Globalisation as we know it will not survive Trump.

      "bodyText": "The prospect of Germany sliding into recession and sharper-than-expected slowdowns in China and the US sent jittery financial markets spiralling downwards across the world to lows last seen in May. Investors dumped shares and bought safer government bonds, adding to the sense of panic that has grown steadily following Donald Trump\u2019s threat this year of extending tariffs to all Chinese exports to the US. The inversion of the US yield curve, known as Wall Street\u2019s original fear gauge, for the first time since 2007 was another widely quoted sign that the US economy faced the prospect of a contraction, possibly as early as next year, further fuelling investor fears. A climbdown by the US president, who has delayed many of the tariffs on laptops and games consoles until after Christmas, failed to prevent the rout after figures for China and Germany revealed that their economies were in severe difficulties. China\u2019s industrial production hit a 17-year low while the growth in retail sales across the world\u2019s second largest economy proved to be lower than expected. Berlin reported that the German economy, the world\u2019s fourth largest after Japan, contracted by 0.1% in the second quarter of the year, halving the growth rate of the 19-member eurozone currency bloc from 0.4% in the previous quarter to 0.2%. Fiona Cincotta, senior analyst at the spreadbetting firm City Index, said fears of a global downturn were stalking the markets. \u201cDoom and gloom dominated after data showed that Chinese industrial output grew at the slowest pace in 17 years, whilst the German economy contracted. \u201cRecession warning bells rang out across the markets as Trump\u2019s delaying of tariffs on some Chinese imports is a case of too little too latte \u2013 the damage to economies has already been done,\u201d she said. In New York, the Dow Jones index of industrial companies fell 800 points, or 3%, while the index of technology stocks, the Nasdaq exchange, tumbled by 2.9%. The value of top London-listed shares lost 134 points, or 1.85%, after the FTSE 100 index dropped to 7,116, its lowest in more than two months. Until recently, investors have focused on the likely impact of US tariffs on growth in the US and China, and stock markets with share values rising and falling with Washington\u2019s running commentary on talks with Beijing. But the damage caused by the ongoing tariff war on exporting nations in Europe and east Asia has begun to persuade many analysts that the global economy is caught in an unstoppable downshift in growth. In response, investors have rushed to buy highly rated government bonds, including US Treasury bonds and UK gilts. The stampede meant that the US Treasury 10-year bond yield curve also inverted for the first time since 2007. The gap between two-year and 10-year bond yields, which translate into the effective interest paid on government debt over different time periods, declined to -0.45 basis points, the narrowest since June 2007. When short-term Treasury bonds pay a higher interest rate than long-term bonds, it\u2019s generally regarded as a sign that investors believe that an economic calamity is likely and that central banks will be forced to slash rates and keep them low for a decade or more. Central banks have already responded to the slowdown by cutting interest rates. The US Federal Reserve, which raised interest rates nine times between 2015 and this year as the economy improved, began to reverse its policy in July, cutting back by 0.25 percentage points. Other central banks have also cut rates, while the European Central Bank, which already applies negative interest rates, said it was likely to loosen monetary policy further in the coming months. Some analysts said the Fed would be forced to vote on further rate cuts in the next few months to support the US economy. Steen Jakobsen, chief economist at Saxo Bank, said the speed of the downturn meant the Fed would need to go ahead with rate cuts between meetings. \u201cThe Fed is behind the curve and has been since September.

Tarantino could never outdo himself in the revisionist history department after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2009/aug/24/inglourious-basterds-reviews-brad-pitt\">Inglourious Basterds</a>, a movie in which a squad of Jewish American soldiers machinegun Adolf Hitler into hamburger. But going into this film, you kinda-sorta know that the gruesome Tate murders are unlikely to play out as they actually did in August 1969, however the fun (and, yes, it is fun, no disrespect to the families of those who were actually killed) is in watching it play out.</p> <p>Brad Pitt\u2019s Cliff Booth is the ultimate Tarantino hero. He works in movies, but in the most workmanlike department \u2013 as a stunt man. He lives behind a drive-in. He spends his days driving around Hollywood doing odd jobs, looking cool, smiling at women (but mostly regarding them from afar). And when duty calls and the job requires it, he can swiftly unleash preposterous amounts of deadly violence. His attack with a can of dog food to prevent the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/15/tarantino-cannes-behind-the-bloodshed-chilling-untold-stories-charles-manson\">Manson Family</a> killers from making their way up the hill to Roman Polanski\u2019s rented home will go down as one of the strangest and most shocking attacks in cinema.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"57a5d8d0e1add2a8aafa692c6df2e4f8231601cf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/57a5d8d0e1add2a8aafa692c6df2e4f8231601cf/0_0_3504_2336/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ultimate man \u2026 Brad Pitt as Cliff Booth.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ultimate man \u2026 Brad Pitt as Cliff Booth.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Cooper/Allstar/Columbia Pictures Corporation</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Spahn Movie Ranch</h2> <p>The languid pace in OUATIH (sorry, I can\u2019t type out the full title any more) allows Tarantino to use the Hollywood of the Mind as an exploratory sandbox. It\u2019s perfect, then, that one of the tensest scenes (and one that a screenwriting professor would likely suggest be truncated, further proving Tarantino\u2019s greatness) is set at the Spahn Movie Ranch.</p> <p>Out on the edge of Los Angeles, the ranch was used for mid-century film and television productions of exactly the sort that Leonardo DiCaprio\u2019s character Rick Dalton would appear in. By the late 1960s, the owner, the old and blind George Spahn had turned the shooting location into something of a \u201cwild west\u201d tourism spot, but it was hardly on most visitors\u2019 must-see list. Gradually, members of Charles Manson\u2019s \u201chippie cult\u201d moved in until they basically had the run of the place by the time of the Tate-LaBianca murders.</p> <p>It\u2019s a footnote in late 1960s California movie lore, so it\u2019s a natural that Tarantino, forever obsessed with the near-forgotten, would set the lengthiest sequence of his film there.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b44afbbd99b42b4d1a41ab4230d8226d7ad7d54a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b44afbbd99b42b4d1a41ab4230d8226d7ad7d54a/0_0_3504_2433/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Leonardo DiCaprio on set \u2026 Tarantino\u2019s locations tell their own story.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"694\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Leonardo DiCaprio on set \u2026 Tarantino\u2019s locations tell their own story.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Cooper/Allstar/Sony Pictures Entertainment</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The legend of Bruce Lee</h2> <p>Can Batman beat up Superman? It\u2019s a question comic-book fans still (embarrassingly) ask and (even worse) some have an answer to. For kids obsessed with junk TV and B-movies from Tarantino\u2019s era, you could easily swap in either of those superheroes with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/oct/01/bruce-lee-ip-man\">Bruce Lee</a>.</p> <p>To that end, it makes perfect sense that Tarantino\u2019s idealised hero \u2013 Brad Pitt\u2019s stuntman Cliff Booth \u2013 would pair off against Bruce Lee (played by Mike Moh) and come away with a tie. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/aug/05/bruce-lee-daughter-shannon-resurrecting-lost-tv-epic-warrior-we-righted-the-wrong\">Lee\u2019s daughter has voiced displeasure</a> at the way her father has been portrayed, calling it \u201cdisrespectful.\u201d Critic Walter Chaw, who liked the film, <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2019/08/on-bruce-lees-character-in-once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood.html\">wrote about</a> how audience responses to the scene troubled him. Issues of respectability aside, the question remains if the fight \u201cactually happened\u201d or if it was something in Cliff\u2019s head. We see the fight in a flashback that also includes a scene drawn from overheard conversation, in which we <em>also</em> see a flash of someone else\u2019s thought\u2019s about Cliff (eg. did he kill his wife?) It\u2019s a little confusing, and intentionally so, but remember that this movie\u2019s title is Once Upon a Time, so perhaps we shouldn\u2019t take all of this too literally.</p> <h2>The film\u2019s sole</h2> <p>At some point in the last decade I became aware that Tarantino was into feet. Hey, everybody\u2019s into something. One can only surmise that he became aware that we became aware, because there are so many tootsies in OUATIH \u2013 even squashed against glass! \u2013 that it goes beyond a joke into a benignly perverse jubilee.</p> <p>The best scene in the movie, and one of the few (if not the only!) extended moments of pure joy in Tarantino\u2019s oeuvre, comes when Robbie\u2019s Tate pops in at a cinema to watch herself on screen.

The scene plays out for a long time and, as a capper, Robbie\u2019s Tate kicks off her heels, leans back and props her feet up <em>directly</em> in front of the lens. It\u2019s a hilarious, knowing wink but it is also a celebration.

Georgia removed 107,000 voters from rolls in July 2017 for non-voting, and 53,000 voter registrations \u2013 70% of them for African American voters \u2013 were flagged for review under the state\u2019s \u201cexact match\u201d rule.</p> <h2>Strict voter ID laws</h2> <p>Research <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/02/15/do-voter-identification-laws-suppress-minority-voting-yes-we-did-the-research/\">has shown</a> that strict voter identification laws suppress voter turnout and favor Republican candidates.

      "bodyText": "The former lawmaker Stacey Abrams \u2013 who energized Democrats in Georgia with her near-miss run for governor there \u2013 said this week that she would not enter the Democrats\u2019 race to be the party\u2019s 2020 presidential candidate. Instead she will be focussing on a new initiative aiming to protect voters in battleground states around the country, although she added she is open to being a running mate in a presidential bid. Abrams, who accused her ultimately successful Republican opponent Brian Kemp of voter suppression in Georgia\u2019s gubernatorial race last year, launched the Fair Fight 2020 campaign, saying: \u201cThere are only two things stopping us in 2020: making sure people have a reason to vote and that they have the right to vote.\u201d Andrew Gillum, a former gubernatorial candidate for the Democrats in Florida, similarly earlier this year launched a big voter mobilization campaign in the crucial state, Bring it Home Florida. But what is the size of the challenge to tackle voter suppression? \u201817 million voters purged\u2019 At least 17 million voters were purged nationwide between 2016 and 2018, according to a recent study by the Brennan Center for Justice. The report, released earlier this month, found that US election jurisdictions with histories of egregious voter discrimination have been purging voter rolls at a rate 40% beyond the national average. Some states have made it harder to vote by aggressively purging voters because their names in voter rolls do not exactly match other state records, or owing to voter inactivity. Georgia removed 107,000 voters from rolls in July 2017 for non-voting, and 53,000 voter registrations \u2013 70% of them for African American voters \u2013 were flagged for review under the state\u2019s \u201cexact match\u201d rule. Strict voter ID laws Research has shown that strict voter identification laws suppress voter turnout and favor Republican candidates. As of 2018, 10 states \u2013 all with Republican-controlled legislatures \u2013 have strict voter ID laws in place, meaning voters without acceptable identification must vote on a provisional ballot and also take additional steps after Election Day for it to be counted, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. An additional 10 states request a photo identification for citizens to vote, and 35 states total request some form of voter identification at the ballot box. Restrictive voter ID laws disproportionately affect Native American voters, especially those who live on reservations and do not have standard residential addresses. And states with such laws may not accept tribal IDs as a valid form of identification. Ahead of the 2018 elections, communities in North Dakota mobilized to overcome any hurdles imposed by the state\u2019s voter ID law. Polling station closures To make it more difficult to vote, some states have closed polling stations, limited early voting or reduced polling hours. States once required under the Voting Rights Act to obtain federal preclearance for changes in voting procedures \u2013 a requirement that was dropped after a 2013 supreme court decision \u2013 have closed almost 20% more polling stations per capita than jurisdictions in the rest of the country, a Vice News investigation found. The trend has resulted in confusion and long wait times at polling locations on Election Day. \u2018Only 31 cases of voter fraud\u2019 This week Donald Trump repeated his warnings of voter fraud \u2013 which has long been a Republican talking point, and criticized by many experts as a cover for voter suppression moves by the party. Trump tweeted: In a piece for the Guardian last year Carol Anderson pointed out: \u201cAs the law professor Justin Levitt has documented, between 2000 and 2014, there have only been 31 cases of voter identification fraud out of one billion votes.\u201d \u2022 This article has been corrected to make clear Abrams ran in the election for Georgia\u2019s governor in 2018",

      "bodyText": "More than \u00a3100m suspected to have been imported to the UK from bribery and corruption overseas has been frozen following a court order obtained by the National Crime Agency. Westminster magistrates\u2019 court granted account freezing orders covering eight bank accounts holding in excess of \u00a3100m which is \u201csuspected to have derived from bribery and corruption overseas\u201d. The NCA said the money is linked to an individual, who has already had \u00a320m of his funds frozen following an earlier hearing in December. The latest freezing order, granted by the court on Monday but only made public on Wednesday, is the largest granted since the Criminal Finances Act was introduced in 2017 to give police greater powers to crack down on people attempting to launder money through the UK. If investigators find further evidence that the funds derive from, or are intended to fund, illegal activities, the NCA can seize the cash. The NCA did not provide any further details about the suspect funds, but pointed towards recent cases in which the agency froze bank accounts of the son of the former prime minister of Moldova and the niece of Syrian ruler Bashar al-Assad. Ben Russell, deputy director of the NCA\u2019s national economic crime centre, said: \u201cIn the last year, the NCA has used new powers such as unexplained wealth orders and account freezing orders to target suspected illicit assets, and we are already seeing some far-reaching impact of this activity.\u201d Earlier this year the NCA seized \u00a325,000 of suspect cash from Anisseh Chawkat, al-Assad\u2019s niece who had been studying design at the University of the Arts London even though several members of her family were subject to international sanctions. She had been granted a student visa despite her mother, Bushra, the president\u2019s sister, being subject to strict financial sanctions. Her father, Assef, had been the head of Syria\u2019s military intelligence. Chawkat was living in a \u00a360,000-a-year rented flat in Knightsbridge. The NCA found that \u00a3151,000 had been paid into her Barclays account via 56 cash deposits made around the country in 2017 and 2018. The money is believed to have been transferred from members of the Assad regime via a Middle East middleman using a \u201csmurfing\u201d criminal network. Smurfing involves the use of multiple individuals to make lots of cash deposits in the hope of avoiding money-laundering checks. The head of the network, sometimes referred to as \u201cpapa smurf\u201d, sends \u201cjunior smurfs\u201d to pay in less than \u00a310,000 at a time. Investigators found that on one day money was paid into Chawkat\u2019s account at Barclays branches in Birmingham, Leeds, north London and St Albans in Hertfordshire. In another case, Vlad Luca Filat, the son of the former prime minister of Moldova, was ordered to hand over almost \u00a3500,000 following a corruption investigation by the NCA. His father, Vladimir Filat, was sentenced to nine years in prison for his role in the \u201ctheft of the century\u201d, whereby $1bn (\u00a3800m) was stolen from three Moldovan banks and laundered through Latvia\u2019s financial system. The theft, equivalent to 12.5% of Moldova\u2019s entire GDP, prompted a huge government bailout of the three banks in an attempt to rescue the country\u2019s financial system, causing the country\u2019s currency to collapse. An NCA investigation found that the son\u2019s extravagant London lifestyle, which included a \u00a31,000-per-day Chelsea penthouse and a \u00a3200,000 Bentley Bentayga, was funded by large deposits from overseas companies, including in the Cayman Islands and Turkey. Large cash sums were paid into three HSBC bank accounts, including \u00a398,000 in one three-day period. The 22-year-old business student at City University was seen in Facebook posts partying in St Tropez, sipping Dom P\u00e9rignon through a straw. Filat was ordered to hand authorities \u00a3466,000 from the three HSBC accounts, which were frozen in May 2018. \u2022 Sign up to the daily Business Today email here or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk.",

Donna Markham spoke on behalf of her daughter Chelsea, who began seeing Nassar after picking up an injury at the age of 10. The abuse that followed precipitated a spiral of despair that ended with Chelsea taking her own life when she was 23.</p> <p>The most widely publicised testimony came from Biles\u2019s former teammate Aly Raisman, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/jan/24/aly-raisman-larry-nassar-horrors-gymnastics-usoc\" title=\"\">who stared down Nassar in the courtroom</a> and declared: \u201cOver those 30 years when survivors came forward, adult after adult \u2013 many in positions of authority \u2013 protected <em>you</em>, telling each survivor it was OK, that you weren\u2019t abusing them.

This is like being violated all over again.\u201d She declined to speak optimistically about the future. \u201cIt\u2019s clear now,\u201d she stated, \u201cthat, if we leave it up to these organisations, history is likely to repeat itself.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fdp8SVOSF4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2fdp8SVOSF4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>And yet, to most intents and purposes, the task of rebuilding for the athletes <em>has</em> been left up to those institutions. Despite attempts to take the moral high ground the US Olympic Committee is deeply compromised on the Nassar scandal, with a congressional report a fortnight ago including it in a series of institutions that failed to protect child and young adult athletes from Nassar in a way that was \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/30/larry-nassar-abuse-congressional-report-usoc-fbi-gymnastics\" title=\"\">a cover-up in spirit</a> \u2026 whether it was a criminal cover-up remains to be proven\u201d.</p> <p>It is difficult to escape the obvious conclusion: that USA Gymnastics, which failed Biles and so many others so spectacularly, should not really still be standing. Last year the USOC began a push to decertify the body. Yet here we still are, with the expectation, certainly on the part of USAG, that its death sentence will be reprieved. While Michigan State has so far paid out $500m in compensation, none of Nassar\u2019s victims has yet been compensated by USAG. Allegedly to expedite this, USAG has <a href=\"https://eu.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2018/12/05/usa-gymnastics-files-bankruptcy-nassar-lawsuits/2218546002/\" title=\"\">begun bankruptcy proceedings</a> \u2013 but these have had the (intended?) effect of staying the executioner\u2019s hand. It cannot be decertified until bankruptcy proceedings have been concluded. At this rate USA Gymnastics will still be running the show for the Tokyo Olympics next year, and perhaps for good.</p> <p>The congressional committee who wrote the report are outraged that declaring bankruptcy could buy USAG almost indefinite time. As one senator puts it: \u201cBankruptcy proceedings should not impede real accountability for bankrupt morals and leadership. American gymnasts deserve so much more than the inept and ineffective USAG.\u201d</p> <p>But will they get it? For all the leadership churn at USAG \u2013 they are currently on their fourth president since allegations surfaced \u2013 many senior officials remain in post.</p> <p>In a particular irony, another part of the reason USAG enjoys success is because of Biles, the only gymnast who disclosed abuse by Nassar to be still competing. Double the crowds turned out for the women\u2019s competition than graced the men\u2019s event \u2013 record crowds \u2013 and they come in large part to see the historically sensational Biles at work. If only <em>she</em> could be permitted to have just one job \u2013 instead of both striving to win and having to push for justice against all the adults who did not do theirs.</p>",

And we had one goal and we\u2019ve done everything that they\u2019ve asked us for, even when we didn\u2019t want to, and they couldn\u2019t do one damn job. You had one job. You literally had one job and you couldn\u2019t protect us.\u201d By way of a recap Nassar was accused of molesting more than 260 athletes under his care (he was also a doctor for Michigan State University). 144 of them testified at his trial, many of them making extraordinary impact statements face-to-face with him in the courtroom. \u201cLittle girls don\u2019t stay little for ever,\u201d one declared. \u201cThey grow into strong women that return to destroy your world.\u201d Some were unable to testify. Donna Markham spoke on behalf of her daughter Chelsea, who began seeing Nassar after picking up an injury at the age of 10. The abuse that followed precipitated a spiral of despair that ended with Chelsea taking her own life when she was 23. The most widely publicised testimony came from Biles\u2019s former teammate Aly Raisman, who stared down Nassar in the courtroom and declared: \u201cOver those 30 years when survivors came forward, adult after adult \u2013 many in positions of authority \u2013 protected you, telling each survivor it was OK, that you weren\u2019t abusing them. In fact, many adults had you convince the survivors that they were being dramatic or had been mistaken. This is like being violated all over again.\u201d She declined to speak optimistically about the future. \u201cIt\u2019s clear now,\u201d she stated, \u201cthat, if we leave it up to these organisations, history is likely to repeat itself.\u201d And yet, to most intents and purposes, the task of rebuilding for the athletes has been left up to those institutions. Despite attempts to take the moral high ground the US Olympic Committee is deeply compromised on the Nassar scandal, with a congressional report a fortnight ago including it in a series of institutions that failed to protect child and young adult athletes from Nassar in a way that was \u201ca cover-up in spirit \u2026 whether it was a criminal cover-up remains to be proven\u201d. It is difficult to escape the obvious conclusion: that USA Gymnastics, which failed Biles and so many others so spectacularly, should not really still be standing. Last year the USOC began a push to decertify the body. Yet here we still are, with the expectation, certainly on the part of USAG, that its death sentence will be reprieved. While Michigan State has so far paid out $500m in compensation, none of Nassar\u2019s victims has yet been compensated by USAG. Allegedly to expedite this, USAG has begun bankruptcy proceedings \u2013 but these have had the (intended?) effect of staying the executioner\u2019s hand. It cannot be decertified until bankruptcy proceedings have been concluded. At this rate USA Gymnastics will still be running the show for the Tokyo Olympics next year, and perhaps for good. The congressional committee who wrote the report are outraged that declaring bankruptcy could buy USAG almost indefinite time. As one senator puts it: \u201cBankruptcy proceedings should not impede real accountability for bankrupt morals and leadership. American gymnasts deserve so much more than the inept and ineffective USAG.\u201d But will they get it? For all the leadership churn at USAG \u2013 they are currently on their fourth president since allegations surfaced \u2013 many senior officials remain in post. In a particular irony, another part of the reason USAG enjoys success is because of Biles, the only gymnast who disclosed abuse by Nassar to be still competing. Double the crowds turned out for the women\u2019s competition than graced the men\u2019s event \u2013 record crowds \u2013 and they come in large part to see the historically sensational Biles at work. If only she could be permitted to have just one job \u2013 instead of both striving to win and having to push for justice against all the adults who did not do theirs.",

It means that traders are accepting a lower interest rate to hold longer-dated bonds than the shorter-dated alternative.</p>\n    <p>It\u2019s relatively rare \u2013 investors typically get higher returns for lending over the long term, as this is seen as riskier than short-term lending. They also expect to be compensated for the impact of inflation, which will eat into investments over time.</p>\n    <p><b>What does it mean?</b></p>\n    <p>An inverted yield curve is a classic signal of a looming recession \u2013 in the US, the curve has inverted ahead of every recession over the past 50 years. It falsely signalled a recession just once, at the time of the 1998 Russian financial crisis.</p>\n    <p>For other countries the signal is less clear.

This indicates that investors are seriously worried about an economic downturn, which would keep inflation low. They are worried about the impact on the already-weak global economy of the prolonged trade war between the US and China, along with Brexit.</p>\n    <p><b>Is recession inevitable?</b></p>\n    <p>No, but it is highly likely. And an inverted yield curve driven by recession fears risks becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy, knocking confidence and causing businesses to cut back on investment.</p>\n    <p><b>How soon does recession tend to follow yield curve inversion?</b></p>\n    <p>Previous downturns show that yields have typically inverted 18 months, on average, before a recession began. <b>Julia Kollewe</b></p>\n    <p><br></p>\n    <p><br></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>That still seems a bit of a long shot but the accumulation of bad economic news means that the battle between the Fed and the White House has been won decisively by Trump.

      "bodyText": "A determined coalition of residents in east London, including a 94-year-old woman who is one of the original residents, has won its battle to stop the council demolishing their homes. Residents of the two blocks in Whitechapel, which stand on prime real estate land, lauded the U-turn by the local mayor, John Biggs, at a meeting on Tuesday night as a victory against social cleansing in the capital. Tower Hamlets council had wanted to demolish the two blocks, Treves House and Lister House, which contain 51 flats, for several years. Residents were dismayed when Biggs admitted at a public meeting two years ago that the building of private flats on the land was under consideration, and that discussions had been going on for a year behind closed doors. Residents planned their fightback to save the blocks from the Treves House living room of Sophie Spielman, who turns 95 in a couple of weeks, and joked that her home was the campaign\u2019s HQ. Spielman originally came to the UK from India and is not only the oldest resident but also the one who has lived there the longest. Her late husband, Nat, who opposed Oswald Mosley\u2019s fascists during the Battle of Cable Street, was the first to move in, in 1959. She joined him a couple of years later. Spielman sat in the front row of Tuesday\u2019s meeting, listening intently to the council officials\u2019 every word . She smiled when Biggs confirmed the blocks would not be demolished. \u201cI\u2019ve been happy here for 57 years. I can\u2019t imagine life anywhere else,\u201d she said. \u201cAll I want to do is live here for the rest of my days and now I\u2019ll be able to do that.\u201d Neighbours from a wide range of backgrounds have been involved in the battle to save the blocks of flats, including Kay Ballard, who says she can trace her cockney roots back seven generations, and the British-Bangladeshi resident Khayrun Begum. The high-spec, brick flats were built in the 1950s in the new brutalist style designed by Count Ralph Smorczewski for Stillman and Eastwick, one of the foremost architecture partnerships of the postwar reconstruction years. At the 2017 meeting which sparked residents\u2019 concerns, Biggs said: \u201cYou would have to do a deal in which you would build a large number of properties. You would build 100 or something and sell off a large chunk.\u201d He said building some flats for sale on the open market would generate enough income to also provide some social housing on the site. The justification for the demolition plans was derived from an expert report which said a lot of costly structural work would be required to make the blocks habitable, costing in the region of \u00a36.2m, so destroying the blocks and rebuilding of the prime site was the preferred option. It came at a time of dwindling supply of council housing in the capital and an ever-lengthening housing waiting list. Similar battles over the destruction of council housing are being fought in many other London boroughs. At the meeting two years ago, Biggs agreed to set up a working group. A new expert report was commissioned and completed in June this year. It found just \u00a31.8m of works were required to refurbish the blocks, rather than the \u00a36.2m originally cited. \u201cIt is agreed the building is generally structurally sound,\u201d the new report stated, with the main requirements being new roofs and windows. After announcing demolition was off the table, Biggs said: \u201cI do appreciate it\u2019s been pretty stressful for all of you.\u201d \u201cThe plans to demolish the blocks were social cleansing,\u201d said resident Syed Ali. \u201cHad they gone ahead we would not have been able to afford to live in our own neighbourhood. I\u2019m so relieved about this decision. It\u2019s not just the anxiety about where we would go if the flats were demolished but the sentimental value too. I was brought up in that flat and all my memories are tied up with it.\u201d",

The newly created states of India and Pakistan had <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmir_conflict\" title=\"\">gone to war</a> over Muslim-majority Kashmir, an independent kingdom at the time. After mediation from the United Nations, all parties agreed that the future of Kashmir was to be decided later via a referendum \u2013 something India and Pakistan have failed to honour. The provisions of the article meant that, pending the final resolution via a plebiscite, the state had its own constitution, its own national flag, a prime minister and a president, even as successive Indian regimes, starting in the early 1950s, diluted the article in order to diminish Kashmir\u2019s autonomy.</p> <p>India has also abrogated article 35A, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_35A_of_the_Constitution_of_India\" title=\"\">introduced in 1954</a>. It empowers the state legislature in Srinagar, the capital, to define who is a permanent resident with the right to buy property and apply for jobs. It\u2019s the dissolution of this article that perhaps presents a graver threat to Kashmiris, as it potentially clears a way for Indians to acquire land.</p> <p>By erasing what was left of its independence the government of India, led by Narendra Modi, has chosen to unilaterally alter the future of an entire people (who have never submitted to Indian sovereignty). Not only that, it has effectively instituted a mass detention of Kashmiris by rushing in thousands of troops in addition to the half a million already stationed there.</p> <p>All of this happened without any consultation with Kashmiris, without any discussion among India\u2019s own parliamentarians, and, most crucially, without any sound legal foundation. Article 370 can only be amended with the approval of the Constituent Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir, which was dissolved in 1956. In its absence, it falls to the legislative assembly of Kashmir to debate and approve any changes to the article, but India suspended that in November last year, putting the state under its direct rule. In place of an elected government, Delhi sent a governor to rule Kashmir.</p> <p>Legal and Kashmir experts agree that a man who\u2019s neither elected nor a representative of the Kashmiri people cannot be a surrogate for an elected body. The necessary legal approval for the revocation, according to India\u2019s own constitutional guarantees, was never sought, therefore rendering the whole exercise a farce, a travesty of democratic norms.</p> <p>As part of this shock-and-awe move, political and civil leaders in Kashmir, including unionists who\u2019ve been arguing India\u2019s case, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/05/kashmir-leaders-placed-under-arrest-amid-security-crackdown\" title=\"\">have been arrested</a>.

Most political parties, most of the Indian media, film stars, some writers \u2013 everyone seems to say in unison: take away the rights of these ungrateful Muslims. Imagine a small landlocked region with a few million people incarcerated in their own homes, up against a mighty power, its army, its people, its media, and you get a sense of the crushing injustice of the situation.</p> <p>India\u2019s treatment of Kashmiris is the clearest glimpse yet of the path that Modi, a Hindu nationalist leader, wants to tread. His vision is for a majoritarian, Hindu-first nation where all debate, difference and dissent will be crushed.

      "bodyText": "I haven\u2019t been able to hear the voices of my parents for more than a week now. We usually talk or exchange messages a few times during the day, mostly about their creeping health issues or about my children\u2019s latest antics here in London. But now, not a peep. It\u2019s because, like all Kashmiris, they\u2019re under siege, experiencing the worst crackdown in three decades, imposed by the Indian government as it revoked the region\u2019s autonomy by abrogating article 370 of the constitution. The article, dating back to 1949, guaranteed Kashmir\u2019s special status within the larger Indian union and enshrined the conditions of the state\u2019s accession to India soon after partition in 1947. The newly created states of India and Pakistan had gone to war over Muslim-majority Kashmir, an independent kingdom at the time. After mediation from the United Nations, all parties agreed that the future of Kashmir was to be decided later via a referendum \u2013 something India and Pakistan have failed to honour. The provisions of the article meant that, pending the final resolution via a plebiscite, the state had its own constitution, its own national flag, a prime minister and a president, even as successive Indian regimes, starting in the early 1950s, diluted the article in order to diminish Kashmir\u2019s autonomy. India has also abrogated article 35A, introduced in 1954. It empowers the state legislature in Srinagar, the capital, to define who is a permanent resident with the right to buy property and apply for jobs. It\u2019s the dissolution of this article that perhaps presents a graver threat to Kashmiris, as it potentially clears a way for Indians to acquire land. By erasing what was left of its independence the government of India, led by Narendra Modi, has chosen to unilaterally alter the future of an entire people (who have never submitted to Indian sovereignty). Not only that, it has effectively instituted a mass detention of Kashmiris by rushing in thousands of troops in addition to the half a million already stationed there. All of this happened without any consultation with Kashmiris, without any discussion among India\u2019s own parliamentarians, and, most crucially, without any sound legal foundation. Article 370 can only be amended with the approval of the Constituent Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir, which was dissolved in 1956. In its absence, it falls to the legislative assembly of Kashmir to debate and approve any changes to the article, but India suspended that in November last year, putting the state under its direct rule. In place of an elected government, Delhi sent a governor to rule Kashmir. Legal and Kashmir experts agree that a man who\u2019s neither elected nor a representative of the Kashmiri people cannot be a surrogate for an elected body. The necessary legal approval for the revocation, according to India\u2019s own constitutional guarantees, was never sought, therefore rendering the whole exercise a farce, a travesty of democratic norms. As part of this shock-and-awe move, political and civil leaders in Kashmir, including unionists who\u2019ve been arguing India\u2019s case, have been arrested. The entire population is under the severest curfew in decades and an unprecedented communications blockade has been put in place, with mobile phones, broadband, even landlines blocked. The world\u2019s largest democracy has cut off Kashmir from the rest of the world. The decision, however, has wide support across India. Most political parties, most of the Indian media, film stars, some writers \u2013 everyone seems to say in unison: take away the rights of these ungrateful Muslims. Imagine a small landlocked region with a few million people incarcerated in their own homes, up against a mighty power, its army, its people, its media, and you get a sense of the crushing injustice of the situation. India\u2019s treatment of Kashmiris is the clearest glimpse yet of the path that Modi, a Hindu nationalist leader, wants to tread. His vision is for a majoritarian, Hindu-first nation where all debate, difference and dissent will be crushed. The rebellious others on the margins, especially if Muslim, are to be subjugated and subjected to a medieval siege to force them to bend to the will of the mega-state. For some, this comes complete with references to spoils of war. Two lawmakers from the ruling party, including a chief minister, have made jokes about \u201cbringing in girls\u201d from Kashmir. Kashmiris will inevitably see this new attack on their body politic as part of a long list of betrayals, and it reinforces the idea that India\u2019s behaviour towards Kashmir has always been like that of a coloniser. The erasure of autonomy, however tenuous, however token, is the starkest display of that relationship \u2013 and it\u2019s important to remember that Kashmir is subject to the densest militarisation on the planet. A video filmed by the BBC shows thousands protesting after Friday prayers in Srinagar. Another video, recorded by Indian journalist Siddharth Varadarajan, shows boys in hospital beds who\u2019ve already been hit in the eyes with lead pellets. As statist Indian journalists (some of whom have been given access to Kashmir while most local journalists remain incommunicado) work overtime to project a narrative of normality, it has fallen to the international media, and a few brave Indian outlets, to report the truth. The BBC, the New York Times, Reuters, Al Jazeera, the Guardian, the Wire India, Scroll India, Telegraph India and a few others have shown protest marches, wounded civilians, and a grieving people seething with anger, despite the unprecedented siege. Addressing the people of Kashmir in 1952, India\u2019s first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, said: \u201cKashmir is not the property of India or Pakistan. It belongs to the Kashmiri people ... We have taken the issue to the United Nations and give our word of honour for a peaceful solution. As a great nation, we cannot go back on it. We have left the question of final solution to the people of Kashmir and we are determined to abide by their decision.\u201d India has now done exactly what Nehru ruled out, going back on its word, and scripted a final betrayal of the Kashmiri people. The journey from being a colony of the British empire to colonising the unyielding Muslim other next door reveals a catastrophic mutation at the heart of the Indian state. I asked a Kashmiri journalist who had returned to Delhi after spending two days in the state if he knew where it was all headed. He responded with one word, Falasteen, the Urdu for Palestine \u2013 a clear reference to the settler-colonialist occupation there. I pray that when I go home next, I do not visit my parents in a colony of the Hindu nationalist empire. \u2022 Mirza Waheed is a journalist and author of the novels The Collaborator and The Book of Gold Leaves",

      "body": "<p>The record producer and label boss Henri Belolo, who has died aged 82, helped define the \u201cEurodisco\u201d genre of the later disco era in the second half of the 1970s.</p> <p>He and his production partner, Jacques Morali, infused the emerging disco sound of New York with a flamboyant melodic style derived from French chanson and big-band opulence. With the groups he created, the Ritchie Family and especially Village People, Belolo took this European-influenced pop-dance music to commercial success in the US and globally.</p> <p>With <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/fame-fortune/victor-willis-ymca-made-millionaire-used-walk-around-30000-pockets/\" title=\"\">Victor Willis</a> as frontman, Village People had massive hits with YMCA and Macho Man (both 1978) and In the Navy (1979), and the group\u2019s outfits and double-entendre subject matter smuggled disco\u2019s gay underground roots into mainstream culture.</p> <p>A producer of French pop for Polydor in Paris who had set up his own label, Belolo had moved to the US in 1973 to be closer to the new dance music he had been licensing in Europe. He opened a New York office as Can\u2019t Stop Productions, and a smaller talent-scouting operation in Philadelphia.</p> <p>\u201cI wanted to be a producer in America but I was looking for the idea,\u201d Belolo explained. The spark came from Morali, a young A&amp;R man Belolo had known in Paris, who suggested they concoct dance music inspired by 40s Busby Berkeley musicals and Carmen Miranda. The result was the Ritchie Family, a female vocal group that had hits with Brazil (1975) and The Best Disco in Town (1976). </p> <p>Belolo and Morali made a formidable team, producing a steady stream of club and chart hits. But they will be remembered primarily for conceiving Village People, the cartoonish sextet of hypermasculine action figures that came to epitomise disco for much of the world.</p> <p>They had already recorded with Willis, who had appeared on Broadway in The Wiz, and were on the look-out for an ensemble to build around him. As Belolo tells it, in 1977 they were walking down Christopher Street in New York when Morali took a fancy to a Puerto Rican bartender dressed as a Native American.</p> <p>Following him to the gay club the Anvil, they watched as he alternated serving drinks with dancing on the bar. When a customer walked in dressed in full Marlboro Man get-up, with stetson and long moustache, \u201cMorali turned to me\u201d, Belolo recalled, \u201cand said, \u2018Oh God, are you thinking what I\u2019m thinking?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>They expanded the concept by scribbling down a list of gay archetypes, adding policeman, leatherman, construction worker, cowboy and soldier/sailor. The bartender, Filipe Rose, was hired as \u201cThe Indian\u201d, with the rest of the group cast in a riotous open audition, with Alex Briley, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/mar/30/guardianobituaries1\" title=\"\">Glenn Hughes</a>, David Hodo and Randy Jones joining Willis in the first permanent line-up.</p> <p>The songs were barely coded hymns to the joys of liberated pre-Aids cruising: \u201cIt\u2019s fun to stay at the YMCA / They have everything for young men to enjoy / You can hang out with all the boys.\u201d YMCA, written by Morali and Willis (with Belolo originally also credited), was a No 1 hit worldwide.</p> <p>Belolo, who was straight, and Morali, who was gay, relished the idea of projecting these macho gay stereotypes to straight America. \u201cI really did it as a provocative, subversive way of telling you: this is the way it is,\u201d he insisted. \u201cI did not like that American mentality of bigotry and hypocrisy, and I didn\u2019t see why these people would be treated like this.\u201d</p> <p>Belolo convinced the US navy to lend him a warship and six aerobatic fighter planes for a music video of In the Navy. Amid the gold and platinum discs in his Paris office hung one of his most treasured keepsakes, a letter from the commanding officer of the frigate USS Reasoner making him an honorary sailor, \u201cin recognition of the outstanding contribution of your new release In the Navy to the morale of USS Reasoner, to the cause of navy retention and the support of navy recruiting\u201d.</p> <p>Village People eventually sold some 65m records and, as disco reached its height, the group even appeared in a film, Can\u2019t Stop the Music (1980), which was largely a disaster.</p> <p>Belolo was a great showman and, though Morali was clearly the musical force throughout the partnership, and legal wranglings later forced Belolo to relinquish some of his writing credits to Willis, it was in his conceptual role that Belolo made an impact. Even today, the best French dance music combines heightened melodies over tough percussion, and it was Belolo, with Morali, who created this template.</p> <p>Born in Casablanca, Morocco, Henri was the son of Albert Belolo, a sailor and Marcelle (Azoulay), a model, and was exposed to many musical styles growing up, including the French pop of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/01/charles-aznavour-obituary\" title=\"\">Charles Aznavour</a> and Edith Piaf, jazz and gospel brought in by US servicemen and the percussion of the city\u2019s Gnawa drum ensembles. He began DJing at clubs, playing records from Ghana and Senegal alongside American party tracks. </p> <p>After studying business at university in Morocco, Belolo went to Paris in 1956. There he met <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/may/16/guardianobituaries.france\" title=\"\">Eddie Barclay</a>, unwittingly wowing the record producer with his jukebox selection in a bar. Barclay, who had transformed the postwar French music industry by importing US jazz and rock\u2019n\u2019roll recordings, hired Belolo to run his operations in Casablanca, promoting records to Morocco\u2019s clubs and radio stations.</p> <p>In 1960 Belolo took up a job at Polydor in Paris. The bulk of his work there was in French pop, and he produced albums by the singer-songwriter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/may/24/georges-moustaki-obituary\" title=\"\">Georges Moustaki</a> and the film stars <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/jul/26/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries\" title=\"\">Serge Reggiani</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jul/31/jeanne-moreau-obituary\" title=\"\">Jeanne Moreau</a>. In 1970 he left to set up his own label, Carabine, followed in 1976 by a publishing company, Scorpio music, which he ran until 2010, when his son, Anthony, took over. He licensed tracks by the Bee Gees, Carl Douglas, Tina Charles, George McCrae and KC and the Sunshine Band, and in 1973 made the move to New York.</p> <p>Belolo and Morali followed up Village People\u2019s success by moulding the pop-rap act Break Machine and bringing breakdancing to Europe. After Morali\u2019s death from Aids in 1991, Belolo focused on licensing European pop dance acts including 2 Unlimited, Eiffel 65, Gala and Haddaway for the French market. He was made a chevalier of the L\u00e9gion d\u2019honneur in 2016.</p> <p>Belolo\u2019s marriage to Daniele Allard ended in divorce; he is survived by his sons, Anthony and Jonathan, three grandchildren and five siblings.</p> <p>\u2022 Henri Belolo, record producer, promoter and executive, born 27 November 1936; died 3 August 2019</p>",

      "bodyText": "The record producer and label boss Henri Belolo, who has died aged 82, helped define the \u201cEurodisco\u201d genre of the later disco era in the second half of the 1970s. He and his production partner, Jacques Morali, infused the emerging disco sound of New York with a flamboyant melodic style derived from French chanson and big-band opulence. With the groups he created, the Ritchie Family and especially Village People, Belolo took this European-influenced pop-dance music to commercial success in the US and globally. With Victor Willis as frontman, Village People had massive hits with YMCA and Macho Man (both 1978) and In the Navy (1979), and the group\u2019s outfits and double-entendre subject matter smuggled disco\u2019s gay underground roots into mainstream culture. A producer of French pop for Polydor in Paris who had set up his own label, Belolo had moved to the US in 1973 to be closer to the new dance music he had been licensing in Europe. He opened a New York office as Can\u2019t Stop Productions, and a smaller talent-scouting operation in Philadelphia. \u201cI wanted to be a producer in America but I was looking for the idea,\u201d Belolo explained. The spark came from Morali, a young A&amp;R man Belolo had known in Paris, who suggested they concoct dance music inspired by 40s Busby Berkeley musicals and Carmen Miranda. The result was the Ritchie Family, a female vocal group that had hits with Brazil (1975) and The Best Disco in Town (1976). Belolo and Morali made a formidable team, producing a steady stream of club and chart hits. But they will be remembered primarily for conceiving Village People, the cartoonish sextet of hypermasculine action figures that came to epitomise disco for much of the world. They had already recorded with Willis, who had appeared on Broadway in The Wiz, and were on the look-out for an ensemble to build around him. As Belolo tells it, in 1977 they were walking down Christopher Street in New York when Morali took a fancy to a Puerto Rican bartender dressed as a Native American. Following him to the gay club the Anvil, they watched as he alternated serving drinks with dancing on the bar. When a customer walked in dressed in full Marlboro Man get-up, with stetson and long moustache, \u201cMorali turned to me\u201d, Belolo recalled, \u201cand said, \u2018Oh God, are you thinking what I\u2019m thinking?\u2019\u201d They expanded the concept by scribbling down a list of gay archetypes, adding policeman, leatherman, construction worker, cowboy and soldier/sailor. The bartender, Filipe Rose, was hired as \u201cThe Indian\u201d, with the rest of the group cast in a riotous open audition, with Alex Briley, Glenn Hughes, David Hodo and Randy Jones joining Willis in the first permanent line-up. The songs were barely coded hymns to the joys of liberated pre-Aids cruising: \u201cIt\u2019s fun to stay at the YMCA / They have everything for young men to enjoy / You can hang out with all the boys.\u201d YMCA, written by Morali and Willis (with Belolo originally also credited), was a No 1 hit worldwide. Belolo, who was straight, and Morali, who was gay, relished the idea of projecting these macho gay stereotypes to straight America. \u201cI really did it as a provocative, subversive way of telling you: this is the way it is,\u201d he insisted. \u201cI did not like that American mentality of bigotry and hypocrisy, and I didn\u2019t see why these people would be treated like this.\u201d Belolo convinced the US navy to lend him a warship and six aerobatic fighter planes for a music video of In the Navy. Amid the gold and platinum discs in his Paris office hung one of his most treasured keepsakes, a letter from the commanding officer of the frigate USS Reasoner making him an honorary sailor, \u201cin recognition of the outstanding contribution of your new release In the Navy to the morale of USS Reasoner, to the cause of navy retention and the support of navy recruiting\u201d. Village People eventually sold some 65m records and, as disco reached its height, the group even appeared in a film, Can\u2019t Stop the Music (1980), which was largely a disaster. Belolo was a great showman and, though Morali was clearly the musical force throughout the partnership, and legal wranglings later forced Belolo to relinquish some of his writing credits to Willis, it was in his conceptual role that Belolo made an impact. Even today, the best French dance music combines heightened melodies over tough percussion, and it was Belolo, with Morali, who created this template. Born in Casablanca, Morocco, Henri was the son of Albert Belolo, a sailor and Marcelle (Azoulay), a model, and was exposed to many musical styles growing up, including the French pop of Charles Aznavour and Edith Piaf, jazz and gospel brought in by US servicemen and the percussion of the city\u2019s Gnawa drum ensembles. He began DJing at clubs, playing records from Ghana and Senegal alongside American party tracks. After studying business at university in Morocco, Belolo went to Paris in 1956. There he met Eddie Barclay, unwittingly wowing the record producer with his jukebox selection in a bar. Barclay, who had transformed the postwar French music industry by importing US jazz and rock\u2019n\u2019roll recordings, hired Belolo to run his operations in Casablanca, promoting records to Morocco\u2019s clubs and radio stations. In 1960 Belolo took up a job at Polydor in Paris. The bulk of his work there was in French pop, and he produced albums by the singer-songwriter Georges Moustaki and the film stars Serge Reggiani and Jeanne Moreau. In 1970 he left to set up his own label, Carabine, followed in 1976 by a publishing company, Scorpio music, which he ran until 2010, when his son, Anthony, took over. He licensed tracks by the Bee Gees, Carl Douglas, Tina Charles, George McCrae and KC and the Sunshine Band, and in 1973 made the move to New York. Belolo and Morali followed up Village People\u2019s success by moulding the pop-rap act Break Machine and bringing breakdancing to Europe. After Morali\u2019s death from Aids in 1991, Belolo focused on licensing European pop dance acts including 2 Unlimited, Eiffel 65, Gala and Haddaway for the French market. He was made a chevalier of the L\u00e9gion d\u2019honneur in 2016. Belolo\u2019s marriage to Daniele Allard ended in divorce; he is survived by his sons, Anthony and Jonathan, three grandchildren and five siblings. \u2022 Henri Belolo, record producer, promoter and executive, born 27 November 1936; died 3 August 2019",

      "body": "<p>\u2018It happened again today,\u201d Bria Kam tells me, throwing her arms up in frustration. I am speaking to Kam and her wife, Chrissy Chambers, over FaceTime from their home in Vancouver, Washington. They are sitting in their workout gear, on the familiar grey couch where they record <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/OurLesbianLove\" title=\"\">the YouTube videos</a> that have turned them into stars. But there are no signature dazzling smiles today.</p> <p>This morning, the couple uploaded a video called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zPa1Z9u9_E\" title=\"\">Ten Ways to Know You\u2019re in Love (Do You Want a Baby?)</a>, a benign collection of comedy sketches (including one in which Chambers falls asleep while Kam is talking, and another in which Chambers is going through her rock collection) followed by an interview with a lesbian couple who had conceived a child with donor sperm.</p> <p>\u201cThe second it went live it was age-restricted and demonetised,\u201d Kam says. Age-restricted videos cannot be found using YouTube\u2019s search engine, and can only be watched by people who have signed in to a YouTube account and given their age as over 18 \u2013 which means many of the pair\u2019s core teenage audience would not be able to see it. Demonetised means YouTube has decided the content is \u201cunfriendly\u201d for most advertisers, so Chambers and Kam will also not be making any advertising revenue from it.</p> <p>It happened so quickly that there was no way the decision could have been made by a person: there was no time for anyone to have watched the video.

In other words, for the past seven years, YouTube has given them a career, an income and hundreds of millions of young, female viewers.</p> <p>But today they have joined six other LGBT YouTube stars to file a class action lawsuit against the platform and its owner Google, suing them for \u201cdiscrimination, fraud, unfair and deceptive business practices\u201d and \u201cunlawful restraint of speech\u201d.</p> <p>This is because the group say that the YouTube algorithm \u2013 purpose-built software that YouTube relies on to recommend, censor and place advertising on videos \u2013 discriminates against LGBT YouTubers purely because they produce LGBT content.</p> <p>Algorithms use automated reasoning to cut through swathes of data \u2013 data sets too large for any human to analyse \u2013 to make decisions.

They are not only ubiquitous and unseen but also very powerful. And in an age in which increasingly mighty tech giants leave it to algorithms to decide who gets access to audiences, the LGBT class action against YouTube is significant for all of us, regardless of our sexuality. If software that is supposed to be neutral is already discriminating against entire communities, who will be next?</p> <p>In the complaint filed against YouTube and Google today, YouTube is said to have become \u201ca chaotic cesspool where popular, compliant, top-quality and protected LGBTQ+ content is restricted, stigmatised and demonetised as \u2018shocking\u2019, \u2018inappropriate\u2019, \u2018offensive\u2019 and \u2018sexually explicit\u2019, while homophobic and racist hatemongers run wild and are free to post vile and obscene content on the pages and channels of LGBTQ+ plaintiffs and other LGBTQ+ content creators or audiences\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"44b8cff9fad579b6d5f7328569055a5bcbc5702a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/44b8cff9fad579b6d5f7328569055a5bcbc5702a/0_0_2000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bria Kam and Chrissy Chambers\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kam and Chambers got married in 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Publicity Image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>YouTube\u2019s CEO, Susan Wojcicki, gave <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMINAiDWI6g\" title=\"\">a video interview</a> to the British YouTuber Alfie Deyes this month in which she responded to claims that LGBT content was being demonetised. \u201cWe do not automatically demonetise LGBTQ content,\u201d Wojcicki said. \u201cWe work incredibly hard to make sure our systems are fair. We have an ML fairness initiative \u2013 ML stands for Machine Learning \u2013 to make sure our algorithms, and the way that our machines work, are fair. We have a committee and a whole process to make sure that we are managing fairness of how our algorithms work.\u201d</p> <p>This is not Kam and Chambers\u2019 first campaign. They made legal history last year when Chambers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jan/18/chrissy-chambers-youtube-revenge-porn-legal-victory\" title=\"\">won unprecedented damages</a> against a British man who uploaded \u201crevenge porn\u201d videos of her online. It was the first civil case of its kind in England and Wales. Now they are taking on one of the world\u2019s most powerful corporations in another landmark lawsuit.</p> <p>The pair first suspected something was wrong in 2013. \u201cYouTube said: \u2018We\u2019re going to be doing this big LGBT campaign, so we want you to make <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U895yYZYlcM\" title=\"\">a video called #ProudtoLove</a>, and just talk about what it\u2019s like to be in a relationship with your partner,\u2019\u201d Kam explains. \u201cWe jumped on it.\u201d</p> <p>The video initially did well, but a couple of years later they discovered it had been demonetised. \u201cWe are absolutely confused by how they could have asked us to create content that they were then going to punish us for.\u201d Kam used YouTube\u2019s automated system to appeal, but got a notification saying that their appeal was ineligible. After they complained on Twitter, a YouTube staffer responded and promised to fix the problem. \u201cWithin seconds it was monetised again,\u201d Kam says.</p> <p>Their videos might sometimes be cheeky, but Kam and Chambers make them with teenagers in mind, and their content is always intended to be gentle. Yet when Kam holds up her iPhone to show me their channel\u2019s user page, only three out of seven videos are monetised. (Four days later, Kam emails to say the Ten Ways to Know You Are in Love video has been remonetised: \u201cI\u2019m assuming a human went back and approved it,\u201d she writes.)</p> <p>Some of the most inoffensive videos the duo have made have been immediately age-restricted by YouTube (including <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6IfmxitpOA\" title=\"\">a music video </a>that involves nothing more controversial than Chambers walking around, fully clothed, in the desert), which denies them key viewers. \u201cAge restriction means we can\u2019t reach the young women who look up to us, who need us as a sense of community and support,\u201d says Chambers. \u201cWe\u2019re not able to be there and give that to them.\u201d Interaction with their fans in the comments section, over private messaging and even live over Skype is a core part of their work, they say. For young people questioning their sexuality, videos created by LGBT YouTubers can demonstrate that a visible, vibrant LGBT community exists. The pair have lost count of the messages they have had from suicidal young people who have found comfort in their channel. \u201cWhen I think about YouTube shutting down our content, it gets me all fired up because they are literally having an impact on someone living another day,\u201d Chambers says.</p> <p>Kam and Chambers also have questions about how much the YouTube algorithm thinks they are worth. The rate a YouTuber is paid per thousand views varies according to the age, location and gender of their audience, and the type of content that audience normally watches. It is a mysterious and constantly changing formula known as the \u201ccost per mille\u201d (CPM): the amount advertisers pay per thousand views. PewDiePie, the gaming video-maker who is one of YouTube\u2019s biggest stars, for instance, makes more than $20m (\u00a316.5m) a year from the platform.</p> <p>\u201cWe have some of the lowest CPMs ever seen,\u201d says Kam. \u201cI think it\u2019s because we are lesbians and our demographic is poor lesbians. If we made makeup videos or gaming videos, we could be millionaires by now. We\u2019re getting 4-5m views a month and we\u2019re getting $4-500 [\u00a3250-330] a month.\u201d</p> <p>A few years ago they could earn a living just from the revenue they got from YouTube ads; changes to the CPM and algorithm now mean they rely on sponsorship, live streaming on other platforms where they interact with viewers in real time and Patreon, where fans pay them a monthly donation in exchange for regular postcards, Skype chats or personalised videos.</p> <p>Yet while their videos are often demonetised, some groups can pay to have homophobic advertising placed on LGBT content. Like several other plaintiffs in the class action case, Chambers and Kam have found anti-gay marriage ads put at the start of their videos. \u201cThat\u2019s not a coincidence,\u201d Kam says. And while the algorithm will censor their videos the moment they are uploaded, it won\u2019t remove offensive comments users post underneath them. It is commonplace for their comments section to be inundated with homophobic abuse \u2013 which they have to police themselves.</p> <p>Kam and Chambers are not sure why all this is happening. \u201cI think YouTube are scared that advertisers will leave and, because they think LGBT is controversial, they are trying to nip it in the bud,\u201d Kam says. Chambers feels YouTube is trying to push independent LGBT contributors off the platform. \u201cThey want viewers to watch the gay content they create through their studios, not the gay content that individual gay creators create. They are becoming more and more controlling.\u201d</p> <p>After seven years of trying to speak to a real person at YouTube, Kam and Chambers finally talked to a YouTube partner development manager this year. \u201cIt was all excuses, corporate jargon. Nothing changed,\u201d says Chambers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fe1a8c4925c89b307d81d739b3a13ff08d04e9ad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fe1a8c4925c89b307d81d739b3a13ff08d04e9ad/37_0_1652_991/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A still from the #ProudtoLove video\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A still from the #ProudtoLove video the duo made for YouTube in 2013.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Youtube/BriaAndChrissy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet the idea that YouTube might be discriminating against LGBT content creators is not new. In March 2017, #YouTubePartyIsOver was trending on Twitter after several prominent YouTubers complained that videos of same-sex couples exchanging vows and makeup tutorials for trans women were being age-restricted. In September 2017, the bisexual author and comedian Gabby Dunn <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gabydunn/status/908536129065967616\" title=\"\">tweeted</a> that all the LGBTQAI content on her channel had been demonetised while the heterosexual content had not.</p> <p>YouTube admitted at the time that its system \u201csometimes makes mistakes\u201d and that restricted mode \u201c<a href=\"https://youtube-creators.googleblog.com/2017/03/restricted-mode-how-it-works-and-what.html\" title=\"\">isn\u2019t working the way it should</a>. We\u2019re sorry and we\u2019re going to fix it.\u201d It blamed an <a href=\"https://youtube-creators.googleblog.com/2017/04/an-update-on-restricted-mode.html\" title=\"\">engineering problem</a>, saying the algorithm \u201cshould not filter out content belonging to individuals or groups based on certain attributes like gender, gender identity, political viewpoints, race, religion or sexual orientation\u201d. But it seems problems remain. </p> <p>In the Deyes interview, Wojcicki insisted the company is supportive of LGBTQ creators. \u201cThe community has been an incredibly important part of YouTube,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have so many creators who have come from that community, and we are really proud that we have been able to assist so many youth who otherwise might have felt more isolated to be able to have a better understanding and connection to the LGBTQ community.\u201d</p> <p>It is only a year after Chambers won her victory in her revenge porn case, a four-year legal battle that left both her and Kam emotionally exhausted. Why go back to court now, to take on an even bigger Goliath? \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to be someone who stood up to the bully,\u201d Chambers says. \u201cWe are not going to let a corporate predator silence our ability to make a difference to the people who gave us this platform in the first place. We\u2019ll never stop making content, whether we\u2019re making money or not.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I die, I want to be able to say: \u2018I might not have made a ton of money, but at least I have made a difference.\u2019\u201d</p>",

YouTube\u2019s CEO, Susan Wojcicki, gave a video interview to the British YouTuber Alfie Deyes this month in which she responded to claims that LGBT content was being demonetised. \u201cWe do not automatically demonetise LGBTQ content,\u201d Wojcicki said. \u201cWe work incredibly hard to make sure our systems are fair. We have an ML fairness initiative \u2013 ML stands for Machine Learning \u2013 to make sure our algorithms, and the way that our machines work, are fair. We have a committee and a whole process to make sure that we are managing fairness of how our algorithms work.\u201d This is not Kam and Chambers\u2019 first campaign. They made legal history last year when Chambers won unprecedented damages against a British man who uploaded \u201crevenge porn\u201d videos of her online. It was the first civil case of its kind in England and Wales. Now they are taking on one of the world\u2019s most powerful corporations in another landmark lawsuit. The pair first suspected something was wrong in 2013. \u201cYouTube said: \u2018We\u2019re going to be doing this big LGBT campaign, so we want you to make a video called #ProudtoLove, and just talk about what it\u2019s like to be in a relationship with your partner,\u2019\u201d Kam explains. \u201cWe jumped on it.\u201d The video initially did well, but a couple of years later they discovered it had been demonetised. \u201cWe are absolutely confused by how they could have asked us to create content that they were then going to punish us for.\u201d Kam used YouTube\u2019s automated system to appeal, but got a notification saying that their appeal was ineligible. After they complained on Twitter, a YouTube staffer responded and promised to fix the problem. \u201cWithin seconds it was monetised again,\u201d Kam says. Their videos might sometimes be cheeky, but Kam and Chambers make them with teenagers in mind, and their content is always intended to be gentle. Yet when Kam holds up her iPhone to show me their channel\u2019s user page, only three out of seven videos are monetised. (Four days later, Kam emails to say the Ten Ways to Know You Are in Love video has been remonetised: \u201cI\u2019m assuming a human went back and approved it,\u201d she writes.) Some of the most inoffensive videos the duo have made have been immediately age-restricted by YouTube (including a music video that involves nothing more controversial than Chambers walking around, fully clothed, in the desert), which denies them key viewers. \u201cAge restriction means we can\u2019t reach the young women who look up to us, who need us as a sense of community and support,\u201d says Chambers. \u201cWe\u2019re not able to be there and give that to them.\u201d Interaction with their fans in the comments section, over private messaging and even live over Skype is a core part of their work, they say. For young people questioning their sexuality, videos created by LGBT YouTubers can demonstrate that a visible, vibrant LGBT community exists. The pair have lost count of the messages they have had from suicidal young people who have found comfort in their channel. \u201cWhen I think about YouTube shutting down our content, it gets me all fired up because they are literally having an impact on someone living another day,\u201d Chambers says. Kam and Chambers also have questions about how much the YouTube algorithm thinks they are worth. The rate a YouTuber is paid per thousand views varies according to the age, location and gender of their audience, and the type of content that audience normally watches. It is a mysterious and constantly changing formula known as the \u201ccost per mille\u201d (CPM): the amount advertisers pay per thousand views. PewDiePie, the gaming video-maker who is one of YouTube\u2019s biggest stars, for instance, makes more than $20m (\u00a316.5m) a year from the platform. \u201cWe have some of the lowest CPMs ever seen,\u201d says Kam. \u201cI think it\u2019s because we are lesbians and our demographic is poor lesbians. If we made makeup videos or gaming videos, we could be millionaires by now. We\u2019re getting 4-5m views a month and we\u2019re getting $4-500 [\u00a3250-330] a month.\u201d A few years ago they could earn a living just from the revenue they got from YouTube ads; changes to the CPM and algorithm now mean they rely on sponsorship, live streaming on other platforms where they interact with viewers in real time and Patreon, where fans pay them a monthly donation in exchange for regular postcards, Skype chats or personalised videos. Yet while their videos are often demonetised, some groups can pay to have homophobic advertising placed on LGBT content. Like several other plaintiffs in the class action case, Chambers and Kam have found anti-gay marriage ads put at the start of their videos. \u201cThat\u2019s not a coincidence,\u201d Kam says. And while the algorithm will censor their videos the moment they are uploaded, it won\u2019t remove offensive comments users post underneath them. It is commonplace for their comments section to be inundated with homophobic abuse \u2013 which they have to police themselves. Kam and Chambers are not sure why all this is happening. \u201cI think YouTube are scared that advertisers will leave and, because they think LGBT is controversial, they are trying to nip it in the bud,\u201d Kam says. Chambers feels YouTube is trying to push independent LGBT contributors off the platform. \u201cThey want viewers to watch the gay content they create through their studios, not the gay content that individual gay creators create. They are becoming more and more controlling.\u201d After seven years of trying to speak to a real person at YouTube, Kam and Chambers finally talked to a YouTube partner development manager this year. \u201cIt was all excuses, corporate jargon. Nothing changed,\u201d says Chambers. Yet the idea that YouTube might be discriminating against LGBT content creators is not new. In March 2017, #YouTubePartyIsOver was trending on Twitter after several prominent YouTubers complained that videos of same-sex couples exchanging vows and makeup tutorials for trans women were being age-restricted. In September 2017, the bisexual author and comedian Gabby Dunn tweeted that all the LGBTQAI content on her channel had been demonetised while the heterosexual content had not. YouTube admitted at the time that its system \u201csometimes makes mistakes\u201d and that restricted mode \u201cisn\u2019t working the way it should. We\u2019re sorry and we\u2019re going to fix it.\u201d It blamed an engineering problem, saying the algorithm \u201cshould not filter out content belonging to individuals or groups based on certain attributes like gender, gender identity, political viewpoints, race, religion or sexual orientation\u201d. But it seems problems remain. In the Deyes interview, Wojcicki insisted the company is supportive of LGBTQ creators. \u201cThe community has been an incredibly important part of YouTube,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have so many creators who have come from that community, and we are really proud that we have been able to assist so many youth who otherwise might have felt more isolated to be able to have a better understanding and connection to the LGBTQ community.\u201d It is only a year after Chambers won her victory in her revenge porn case, a four-year legal battle that left both her and Kam emotionally exhausted. Why go back to court now, to take on an even bigger Goliath? \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to be someone who stood up to the bully,\u201d Chambers says. \u201cWe are not going to let a corporate predator silence our ability to make a difference to the people who gave us this platform in the first place. We\u2019ll never stop making content, whether we\u2019re making money or not. \u201cWhen I die, I want to be able to say: \u2018I might not have made a ton of money, but at least I have made a difference.\u2019\u201d",

There is no toilet or shower on the boat, only blue plastic buckets. Inside the cabins the lights are dim so Thunberg will need a headlamp or torch to read and keep her journal. Internet access is also likely to be patchy, so her 883,000 Twitter followers may have to wait longer than usual for updates via satellite phone.

      "bodyText": "On white-crested swells under leaden skies, the teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg has set sail from Plymouth on arguably her most daunting challenge yet. A two-week crossing of the Atlantic during hurricane season in a zero-carbon yacht \u2013 harnessing wind, sun, and hydro power \u2013 is the first obstacle. But it is unlikely to be the toughest in an odyssey through the Americas over many months. This will be both the ultimate gap year and a journey into the heart of climate darkness: first to the United States of president Donald Trump, who has promised to pull out of the Paris climate agreement, and then down to South America, possibly including Brazil where president Jair Bolsonaro is overseeing a surge of Amazon deforestation. In between, the 16-year-old Swede will add her increasingly influential voice to appeals for deeper emissions cuts at two crucial global gatherings: the Climate Action Summit in New York on 23 September and the the UN climate conference in Santiago in early December. The reception awaiting her on the other side is likely to be mixed, with the climate issue a polarising point in US politics. In a taste of the hostility that is likely to come from supporters of the fossil fuel industry, Steve Milloy, a Fox News contributor and former member of the Trump transition team, described Thunberg on Twitter earlier this week as \u201cthe ignorant teenage climate puppet\u201d. The young founder of the school climate strike movement appeared unfazed in a quayside press conference before she boarded the vessel. \u201cThere\u2019ll always be people who don\u2019t understand or accept the science. I\u2019ll ignore them,\u201d she said. \u201cClimate delayers want to shift the focus from the climate crisis to something else. I won\u2019t worry about that. I\u2019ll do what I need.\u201d Speaking to a throng of several dozen reporters from around the world, she said her primary goal was to raise awareness among the public about the climate emergency. \u201cPeople (need to) come together and put pressure on people in power so they have to do something,\u201d she said. Asked if she will meet Donald Trump, the teenager said it would be a waste of time because the US president hasn\u2019t been persuaded by the experts he has already spoken to. \u201cI\u2019m not that special. I can\u2019t convince everyone,\u201d she said. The voyage is a demonstration of her declared values, which revolve around reducing emissions. A flight to New York would have been much quicker, but it would pump close to 1,000kg of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Conventional cruise ships often have an even bigger footprint. Instead, Thunberg \u2013 along with her father, a cameraman and a two-man crew \u2013 are taking a zero carbon option. The Malizia II is an 18 metre (60ft) racing yacht that was built for round-the-world challenges and has just completed the Fastnet race, which runs every two years. While the wind propels it, the vessel generates the power for lighting and communication through solar panels and underwater turbines. The racing team have removed sponsorship logos from the hull and emblazoned Greta\u2019s slogan \u201cUnite Behind the Science\u201d on the mainsail. The yacht is designed for speed rather than luxury so conditions will range from basic to difficult. There is no toilet or shower on the boat, only blue plastic buckets. Inside the cabins the lights are dim so Thunberg will need a headlamp or torch to read and keep her journal. Internet access is also likely to be patchy, so her 883,000 Twitter followers may have to wait longer than usual for updates via satellite phone. Her diet will be freeze-dried vegan meals \u2013 she has given up meat, which is a major source of emissions. The young Swede is braced for sea sickness. Although the waves were small as she left Mayflower Marina in Plymouth, she will be fortunate if they remain that way. August is part of the hurricane season in the Atlantic. Even in moderate swells, the vessel is noisy and bumpy. The experienced German captain, Boris Hermann, said the 3,500 nautical mile journey would demonstrate that it is possible to cope without fossil fuels and get closer to nature. \u201cI want to show that this can be positive and exciting,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that solidarity with Greta is not limited to eco-activists.\u201d Thunberg accepts that solar yachts are not for everyone but says she is taking the opportunity to demonstrate there are alternatives. \u201cI don\u2019t tell people what to do. People can do what they want.\u201d The journey marks a new stage in the remarkable rise of the young Swede, who was unknown outside of her family and school until she started a climate strike last August. She has been diagnosed with Aspergers and has at various times experienced depression, anxiety and selective mutism. Today, however, she has become the spokesperson for the global climate movement and its most recognisable face. Her Fridays for Future campaign has now mobilised more than a million students across the globe. She has been invited to UN summits, feted at the World Economic Forum in Davos, nominated for the Nobel peace prize, collaborated on a song with the band the 1975, appeared on the cover of countless magazines and been credited with injecting new life into the climate movement. Last month, the head of the trillion-dollar Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) described the campaign by Greta and others as the greatest threat to the fossil fuel industry. \u201cSome things are actually changing, like the mindsets of people. It\u2019s not fast enough, but it\u2019s something,\u201d she said. The scale of the movement will be tested on 20 September, when Thunberg and others have called for a global general strike for the climate. By that time Thunberg should be in the US, where she plans to meet the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, as well as US politicians. She has been promised a warm welcome from the congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, with whom she has already discussed strategies to raise climate ambitions and mobilise campaigners.

The article suggests the much-delayed project may be delivered around 2025-6. But even this assessment should be treated with real caution. An identical reactor being built at Flamanville in France, which was started in 2007, was supposed to open in 2012. The French nuclear regulator has now sought more work on faulty welds across the reactor, meaning another three-year delay until 2022, ie 15 years after construction began. The additional costs of building this reactor will burden EDF further and inevitably impact on Hinkley Point C. I agree with the National Infrastructure Commission that the costs and delays to new nuclear are such that the UK has to refocus on more deliverable and cheaper renewable energies.

As Kehinde Andrews points out, the \u201cowners\u201d of enslaved people \u201cwere paid reparations in the largest government bailout in history\u201d. It should be feasible to follow that money, then reverse and increment the reparations based on family and corporate wealth directly accrued from the transatlantic slave trade.

      "bodyText": "The Unite leader Len McCluskey has said Labour must support a pragmatic Brexit deal, saying it appeared to be impossible to stop no deal and that there was no path to a second referendum. The trade union boss, a key ally of Jeremy Corbyn whose views will carry significant weight in writing any future party manifesto, said Labour had to address how it would approach negotiating future trade deals if the UK had left the EU after Labour came to power. \u201cI believe that if we haven\u2019t left by 31 October that we should respect the 2016 referendum, which means leaving Europe but on a deal that the 48% would be happy with,\u201d McCluskey told the BBC. \u201cThat is access to a frictionless market and a customs union protecting jobs and investment. \u201cAnd the 52% would be happy because of the policies that Labour have to invest in their communities and to deal with the abuses of migrant labour coming into our country with labour market regulations.\u201d He said a no-deal Brexit would be \u201calmost impossible to stop\u201d and said he was not certain a no-confidence vote in Boris Johnson would be successful. \u201cThe important thing for me is for Labour to continue to hold a very clear vision of the type of Britain we want to be and the relationship we want with Europe, because come the 31 October if we leave without a deal, there is still going to have to be debate and discussion about trade deals and about what kind of relationship we have,\u201d he said. McCluskey said that a referendum would be \u201ca legitimate stance\u201d in order to test the popularity of no deal with the British public but said he did not believe it would take place. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen, of course \u2013 there isn\u2019t going to be a second referendum under Boris Johnson\u2019s no-deal approach to life,\u201d he said. Asked if that went against so many Labour supporters and MPs who wanted another referendum, McCluskey said: \u201cSo many Labour MPs and supporters want the issue done and dusted.\u201d McCluskey said the trade unions had endorsed a position that Labour should negotiate a Brexit deal if they came to power prior to the UK leaving. The joint position, agreed by union leaders in the aftermath of disappointing results for Labour in the EU elections, also suggested any Labour-brokered deal be put to a public vote, but the party would not commit to campaigning for remain against its own Brexit deal.",

Obviously there\u2019s more chance of a draw, with a day lost to rain. Is that to Australia\u2019s advantage, with one fewer match for England to make up the series deficit?

Of course, we\u2019ll have extended hours over the next four days and might well still get a result.

Bill Frindall\u2019s obituary suggests 377 Tests professionally, and as he took that job at the age of 27, probably had a couple of dozen before that. The Wisden piece below had Richie Benaud\u2019s tally at 486, but that was when the piece was written in the Ashes summer of 2002-03. Richie had another three summers in England and another nine or ten summers in Australia, so you can probably add another 65 or so to that, round it out at 550 or so. Today, if we get on, is Test 2355. So even today Richie would have seen almost a quarter of all Tests ever played.<br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d5422c08f0896be8f8f9217\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-14T15:05:15.816Z\">4.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it likely that Bill Frindall saw more Tests than Aggers, CMJ or any other TMS person? He always seemed to be on duty during every session of every match. At least in what remains of my memory.\u201d</p> <p>Good point from Kim Thonger: the scorers do tend to see more cricket than the callers. Andy Zaltzman was at more than 30 World Cup matches this summer, for instance. But I don\u2019t know how much Bill Frindall toured overseas \u2013 others can advise. And I don\u2019t know that he did matches other than England\u2019s. Someone like Benaud covered two countries\u2019 seasons every year.<br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d5421238f084f687f356727\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-14T14:59:40.179Z\">3.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>\u201cThere doesn\u2019t seem to be any mention of the toss having been made. Surely the rain doesn\u2019t need to stop that part of the game, or do the rules say otherwise? It\u2019s not like they would have had a re-toss if it started bucketing down straight after, so the argument that it would affect what the winner would choose seems irrelevant. It would at least give us something to dissect. Am I wrong?\u201d</p> <p>Well... yes, Nick Mills, if I can be so indelicate. You are. You\u2019re not wrong about there being no mention of the toss, because there hasn\u2019t been one. But of course a captain after days of lost time and lots of moisture affecting the conditions might make a different decision at the toss. You can\u2019t ask someone to decide on one day what they might not start doing until four days later. They haven\u2019t even formally named teams yet, because the match hasn\u2019t formally begun.<br></p> <p>Of course it could start raining straight after a toss, but that would just be bad luck. There has to be a starting point drawn somewhere, even if it\u2019s arbitrary. But likewise there\u2019s no point ruling a start before there has been an opportunity to make that start.<br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d5420308f0896be8f8f91f4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/geoff-lemon\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-14T14:56:03.283Z\">3.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Hello, English friends.

Then, and this was particularly the case on the Sunday at Edgbaston, depression: he is <em>never</em> going to get out. I am going to spend the rest of my life watching him bat.

In Australia, it has to be raining for about three days straight before more than 0.1% of people remember to bring an umbrella out of the house. Here, the first drop of precipitation and bang: up go a forest of brollies. Then you have to work out footpath spacing and walking trails as everyone has a wider profile, and for the taller people among us there are a lot of metal spines at eyeball height. And yet it seems to work. People naturally take slightly wider berths and the umbrellas zip seamlessly between one another like a water ballet. It\u2019s a wonder to watch.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d253ed2eedb657bbc82e7fe171670bb54e0416f0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d253ed2eedb657bbc82e7fe171670bb54e0416f0/0_0_3500_2166/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fans shelter from the rain under umbrellas outside Lord\u2019s ahead of day one of the second Ashes Test.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"619\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">It\u2019s brolly time.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Walton/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-08-14T09:22:01.032Z\">at 10.22am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d53cd428f0896be8f8f8dff\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-14T09:00:07.363Z\">10.00am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Ok, I\u2019ve taken a tour on foot around Lord\u2019s to bring you the latest.

      "bodyText": "Who does a washout benefit? Obviously there\u2019s more chance of a draw, with a day lost to rain. Is that to Australia\u2019s advantage, with one fewer match for England to make up the series deficit? Is it to England\u2019s, to nullify a ground where Australian teams have played well for over a century? The wilds of the north will be different. Of course, we\u2019ll have extended hours over the next four days and might well still get a result. But if any more rain comes \u2013 and there are bits and pieces forecast \u2013 we\u2019ll lose serious time with each delay. Let\u2019s come back tomorrow to see what happens next. Thanks to Rob Smyth for being my comrade in damp, and everyone else for playing along on THE RAIN SHOW! Until next time. \u201c550 tests out of 2355, but how many days commentating?\u201d asks Mark Lewis. \u201cSomething statisticians might (struggle to) get their teeth into. How many of the 550 tests were washouts, 3 day drubbings, etc? Where would one begin!?\u201d Smart footy. Good stat from some sentient books. I know, I know... but it\u2019s about the ball, innit? It gets wet and soggy and it doesn\u2019t work. And it\u2019s about the pitch: it gets boggy and then dries and then you need Victor Trumper dancing about to make a match-high 37. And it\u2019s the combination of ball and pitch, because if you thunk a bouncer into the mud it won\u2019t bounce at all, it\u2019ll just stick there in the divot like a strawberry in icing. Bring us a floating drone-tarp! That\u2019s it folks. We will not get on today after the soaking that the ground has taken. So the traditionalists will get their wish: the Lord\u2019s Test will start on a Thursday after all. Though the iconoclasts will get their wish too: another four-day Test match. That was plenty of time when Ireland visited a few weeks ago, and it might well be plenty of time for us here. Alright then. Bill Frindall\u2019s obituary suggests 377 Tests professionally, and as he took that job at the age of 27, probably had a couple of dozen before that. The Wisden piece below had Richie Benaud\u2019s tally at 486, but that was when the piece was written in the Ashes summer of 2002-03. Richie had another three summers in England and another nine or ten summers in Australia, so you can probably add another 65 or so to that, round it out at 550 or so. Today, if we get on, is Test 2355. So even today Richie would have seen almost a quarter of all Tests ever played. \u201cIsn\u2019t it likely that Bill Frindall saw more Tests than Aggers, CMJ or any other TMS person? He always seemed to be on duty during every session of every match. At least in what remains of my memory.\u201d Good point from Kim Thonger: the scorers do tend to see more cricket than the callers. Andy Zaltzman was at more than 30 World Cup matches this summer, for instance. But I don\u2019t know how much Bill Frindall toured overseas \u2013 others can advise. And I don\u2019t know that he did matches other than England\u2019s. Someone like Benaud covered two countries\u2019 seasons every year. \u201cThere doesn\u2019t seem to be any mention of the toss having been made. Surely the rain doesn\u2019t need to stop that part of the game, or do the rules say otherwise? It\u2019s not like they would have had a re-toss if it started bucketing down straight after, so the argument that it would affect what the winner would choose seems irrelevant. It would at least give us something to dissect. Am I wrong?\u201d Well... yes, Nick Mills, if I can be so indelicate. You are. You\u2019re not wrong about there being no mention of the toss, because there hasn\u2019t been one. But of course a captain after days of lost time and lots of moisture affecting the conditions might make a different decision at the toss. You can\u2019t ask someone to decide on one day what they might not start doing until four days later. They haven\u2019t even formally named teams yet, because the match hasn\u2019t formally begun. Of course it could start raining straight after a toss, but that would just be bad luck. There has to be a starting point drawn somewhere, even if it\u2019s arbitrary. But likewise there\u2019s no point ruling a start before there has been an opportunity to make that start. Hello, English friends. Hello everyone else too. I can answer one question below about who has seen the most Test cricket: this is Jim Maxwell\u2019s 305th Test match attended in a professional capacity. He may not track these numbers but I do. Throw in perhaps another 20 that he would have watched in Sydney before starting professional work in 1973, and you\u2019ve got a decent number. Scyld Berry though of the Telegraph has seen upward of 400 Test matches, and if I remember the story correctly had never missed a Lord\u2019s Test in his lifetime until last year when his daughter\u2019s wedding fell on that weekend. I wonder if it was a test. That\u2019s it from me for now. Geoff will be with you until the inevitable abandonment - bye. Meanwhile, in Port-of-Spain, West Indies are 114-0 after 1o overs against India. And it\u2019s not even a T20 match. (Thanks to Rob Smith for alerting me to that.) \u201cI recall that about five players were given new caps in the England v Ireland ODI in May 2015,\u201d says Paul Chandler. \u201cI don\u2019t think a ball was bowled that day. Certainly not more than a few overs. Not sure if all those players went on to get more caps.\u201d That was Zafar Ansari\u2019s only ODI appearance, but it\u2019s in the book because 18 overs were bowled (though none by him). He also went on to play three Tests. The other debutants in that ODI were Jason Roy, James Vince, Mark Wood and David Willey, whose subsequent exploits need no further descIT ONLY BLOODY WELL CAME HOME! \u201cI remember reading a while back that, before he passed away, Richie probably had a good claim to have watched the most live Test cricket of any human being, ever,\u201d says Neil Stewart. \u201cRichie obviously can\u2019t add to his match tally now, and there must now be some other candidates to nominate. Clive Lloyd seems a good bet, or perhaps Geoffrey Boycott. Jim Maxwell or even Jonathan Agnew. Ranjan Madugalle seems to referee every match I\u2019ve been to. Do you or readers have other nominees?\u201d I don\u2019t \u2013 but Wisden 2003 does. It\u2019s now pouring down at Lord\u2019s. Plotspoiler: ain\u2019t gonna be no cricket today. \u201cHas any unfortunate ever been given their national cap without ever getting on the field for their country?\u201d asks Sean Clayton. \u201cAnd would they have to give the cap back if it did happen?\u201d I suspect the answer to both questions is no. The one person who does come to mind is poor Alan Jones. \u201cWas any cricketer as universally loved (particularly in England and Australia) as Richie Benaud?\u201d muses William Charlton. \u201cDid any cricketer do as much both on and off the field? His integrity and impartiality shone like a beacon. Could we not honour his greatness with a statue at one of our Test grounds?\u201d I agree, Benaud was cricket\u2019s best friend. There is a statue of him at the Sydney Cricket Ground; I suppose people would say there are English players more deserving of a statue at the Test grounds in this country. I don\u2019t feel strongly either way, I just want a quiet life. \u201cDear Rob,\u201d says Jason Ali. \u201cI have a query related to Jofra Archer\u2019s debut Test cap. If the entire match was washed out, would his cap truly count?\u201d No, it wouldn\u2019t. The last time that happened in an England Test, I think, was in Guyana in 1990. \u2018Remember when\u2019 is the lowest form of conversation Twenty-nine years ago today, a 17-year-old Sachin Tendulkar made a glorious maiden Test century. All hail the Marmy Army I\u2019m sorry to say it\u2019s raining again, and I fear that might be it for today. Heavy rain is forecast for between 3-5pm. If the match does start, the afternoon session with be 3.30-5.10pm, with the evening session from 5.30-7pm. Jofra Archer has been handed his Test cap by Chris Jordan, which is a nice touch. Play will start at 3.30pm, caveats permitting. We\u2019re going to get some cricket! (If there\u2019s no more rain) The toss will take place at 3pm, with the match starting at I\u2019llgetbacktoyou. The imaginary prize for email of the day goes to... \u201cThe first Test was my first real experience of watching SPD Smith,\u201d says Robert Ellson. \u201cI think watching him bat is essentially like going through the five stages of grief. At first, denial: you watch him shuffle across his stumps and think he\u2019s going to get out LBW every ball. Then anger: you can\u2019t believe this joker is getting so lucky as to play across his pads and never miss it. \u201cThen, as you realise that it\u2019s not luck, it\u2019s skill and technique, you switch to bargaining: I\u2019ll settle for him getting 80 and hope that England take wickets at the other end. Then, and this was particularly the case on the Sunday at Edgbaston, depression: he is never going to get out. I am going to spend the rest of my life watching him bat. I think I\u2019ve got to acceptance, that we\u2019re in the presence of an all-time great and we might as well enjoy it. But this might change if he\u2019s 150* on Saturday morning.\u201d \u201cInspection by Leftfield?\u201d muses James Debens. \u201cThat\u2019s bare lame from the insomniac\u2019s boyfriend, Boris Starling, my superannuated amigo. All we hep daddios are grooving to the Balearic beatz of Introspection by MGMT, only the band that Can could have been. Introspection was a cover of a deeply obscure psychedelic cut by Faine Jane. As in the Edge is faine...\u201d Can anyone translate? \u201cGood to see we are still in with a shout in this Test,\u201d says Ian Copestake. \u201cLoved your Joy of Six, sir. Go on, give it a plug!\u201d Oh go on then. \u201cAfternoon Rob,\u201d says Matt Emerson. \u201cThe article on GD McGrath had me scuttling off to Statsguru. Here\u2019s the list of the England batsmen who had the best average when McGrath was playing for Australia (min 5 matches). No surprise to see KP highest \u2013 his average is actually under 40 when McGrath isn\u2019t in the side. Cook\u2019s average of 27.60 v 42.63 when McGrath wasn\u2019t playing is an interesting counterpoint...\u201d I\u2019d be loath to read too much into that Cook stat, simply because he only played one series against McGrath. Mind you, I\u2019d love to see head-to-head data from the 1980s and 1990s. I remember producing some statistical F.U.N. before the 2002-03 Ashes, and found that Ponting averaged something like 160 against Caddick and 20 against Gough. Gough was then ruled out of the series and Ponting hammered centuries in the first two Tests, but it\u2019s the thought that counts. \u201cHow\u2019s the panel going?\u201d says Emma John. \u201cI\u2019m doing one on the best country music alter egos\u2026 it\u2019s pretty niche. But it did introduce me to Lester \u2018Roadhog\u2019 Moran and the Cadillac Cowboys.\u201d When you say pretty niche. As for Smith, I\u2019ve cracked the case - all we need is a flux capacitor and Chris Tremlett. \u201cDear Rob,\u201d says Boris Starling. \u201cWhenever I see the word \u2018inspection\u2019 in an OBO, I think of this (frankly epic) Leftfield track.\u201d You and nones of others, I suspect. Great song, though. They\u2019ve done some rare old corkers. Snake Blood, which I think was done for the film The Beach, is my favourite. The umpires will inspect against at 2.30pm. They are worried about a few damp patches on the outfield. The umpires are inspecting at their leisure. If it stays dry I suspect play will start around 3pm, but there have been smaller ifs. \u201cHow to get Smith out?\u201d muses Matt Dony. \u201cHmmm. If there\u2019s one thing I know about Australians, it\u2019s that they flipping love You\u2019re The Voice by John Farnham. Regular blasts of that through the PA, then when he starts joining in with the \u2018Whooohooohooooaah\u2019 bits in closed-eyed rapture, send Archer in to demolish the stumps. I\u2019m not one for the moral high ground.\u201d \u201cArcher is the key to dismissing Steve Smith,\u201d says Ian Batch. \u201cThe fact he bowls so close to the stumps (bowlers end) and fast, means that Smith\u2019s trigger movement across the stumps will make him more susceptible to LBW because he can\u2019t get outside the line of off stump like he can to those that deliver from wider on the crease. \u201cArcher should also bowl a knuckle ball an over with a catching cover and midwicket in place so that any mistimed shot can be taken \u2013 similar to Maxwell\u2019s dismissal in the WC semi-final when he was through his shot early and completely deceived. The faster you bowl, the harder it is to detect the slower ball, so ideally one after a very slippery bouncer would be my instruction.\u201d Smith averages 92 in Tests when facing 90mph+ deliveries, you know. That said, Archer is different for the reasons you state. The fact he gets so close to the stumps will be a problem for their left-handers as well. \u201cRob,\u201d says Bob O\u2019Hara. \u201cDoes the apocalyptic forecast for later just mean that England will be batting first?\u201d Inspection at 2pm! It has stopped raining and the covers are coming off, though the forecast for later is apocalyptic. Don\u2019t get your hopes up. Have you listened to this week\u2019s Spin podcast? If not, do so at your earliest convenience - it\u2019s a gem. \u201cThere doesn\u2019t seem to be any mention of the toss,\u201d says Nick Mills. \u201cSurely the rain doesn\u2019t need to stop that part of the game, or do the rules say otherwise? It\u2019s not like they would have had a re-toss if it started bucketing down straight after the toss had been held, so the argument that it would affect what the winner of the toss would choose seems irrelevant. It would at least give us something to dissect. Am I wrong?\u201d You are. They only toss up when they have a scheduled start time. That seems fair to me, because the captain who wins the toss deserves to have a vague idea of the conditions in which the game will start. Also, both teams need to name their final XI at the toss. If England had to pick a team today, they might choose Curran over Leach. If the game doesn\u2019t start until tomorrow, and the sun shines as expected, they\u2019d be much more likely to choose Leach. The Lord\u2019s bogeyman Nobody does nostalgia as well as Scott Oliver, and this is a masterful piece on the man who shattered a million English dreams. Thanks Geoff, hello everyone. Nothing much to report, so I\u2019m going to proceed with a panel on how the flip England can dismiss Steve Smith. If anyone changes at Lord\u2019s, you\u2019ll hear it here fourth. And last before lunch it\u2019s Neil Truby. The rain is still coming down, the ground is drenched, and the food smells good. I\u2019m about to be carried away on the scent like Yogi Bear. Battery is down to 7%. What happened there? \u201cHere in Somerset, whence London\u2019s weather comes, it\u2019s not exactly sunny, but it\u2019s no longer raining, and with a drying breeze. I\u2019ve already been outside to check whether the Husqvarna can go on yet, with a further inspection due at 1.30. Weather travels at 30mph I believe so you should be good for a 5pm start.\u201d I\u2019ll leave you with Rob before electricity forces our separation. Thanks for the company. \u201cI thought some OBO readers might like to see real-time footage of the weather at Lord\u2019s, so here\u2019s a link to the webcam at the zebra crossing outside Abbey Road Studios which is 400 metres away from the ground. You scroll down and click on the red \u2018live\u2019 button to get it.\u201d Very thoughtful from Romeo. Martin Gillam emails in happily. \u201cThe rain delay has a huge bonus for we Australians watching Channel 9 here \u2013 they\u2019re replaying the 2006-07 test from Adelaide. Wonder how that will turn out?\u201d We\u2019re down to 18% with 10 minutes to go. Can we nurse this blog through until Smyth saves the day? \u201cI thought that \u2018not clever\u2019 was an example of litotes, but it\u2019s been a very long time since I studied grammar and am probably mistaken,\u201d writes Ben Powell. Aside from litotes sounding like things that grow on your tonsils, that\u2019s true, it is a positive expressed by the negative. My thought is just that the adjective doesn\u2019t match because cleverness is an attribute of a sentient being acting deliberately, not a fortunate turn of events. Good and clever are not synonyms, even if cleverness is generally good. If you want an update to show how professional this operation is, my laptop cord has now given up the ghost and we\u2019re on 23% battery life with 18 minutes until the lunch break. Hmmm. Like this match, the last life is slowly leaching away. \u201cI think cricket\u2019s use of language adds to the charm,\u201d writes Dave Adams. \u201cI love the Australian use of \u2018ordinary\u2019, which is similar to when you hear commentators say a batsman averaging 7.9 in a series is \u2018pretty moderate\u2019 when they actually mean \u2018dismal\u2019, \u2018shocking\u2019, or just \u2018shit\u2019. There\u2019s a fine line between cowardly and diplomatic, and I guess it\u2019s difficult to be too harsh on a player as a journalist if you\u2019re reliant on them being willing to give you an interview at some point. By the way - forecast says it\u2019s going to stop raining (properly this time) in 53 minutes...\u201d I\u2019ll believe it when I see it. \u201cI used to have a knack of coming to Ashes Tests on wet days,\u201d writes Tim Sanders. \u201cThe Friday at Lords in 1977 was the last rain in England for 3 months. The Sunday at Headingley in 2001 had just enough play to avoid refunds, and led to Gilchrist\u2019s bold declaration. The Saturday at Old Trafford in 2005 gave me a treasured memory of my late father-in-law, as he sat alone in the stand attempting the crossword as the Yorkshire Post turned to papier m\u00e2ch\u00e9 in his hands. \u201cSo when my son and I made our way to Trent Bridge on a cloudy Thursday morning in 2015, I was pessimistic. However, that day turned out OK for most of those present. I\u2019m convinced that it was Joe Root and Jonny Bairstow\u2019s batting that made the sun come out that afternoon.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t wait to see how you keep yourself entertained over four days of rain at Old Trafford. I think we might see the emergence of \u2018Canal Walking With Geoff Lemon\u2019 as an OBO highlight.\u201d Bring me a raincoat will you, Grif? I\u2019ll need a local one. The rain came back, if you hadn\u2019t guessed. It\u2019s really just a matter of when we call it off now, though a decent wedge of crowd remains under the roofs. May as well be here as anywhere, I suppose? If you want something else to do while we wait, have a listen to Our Emma and her Spin podcast. \u201cGood morning, Geoff.\u201d Good morning, Graham Samuel-Gibbon! \u201c\u2018Not clever\u2019 doesn\u2019t make much sense, I agree. But the Australian use of \u2018ordinary\u2019 is not particularly ordinary.\u201d That is true. It\u2019s an ongoing legacy of cowardly language, where we use euphemisms until they lose their meaning. So if something is reasonably acceptable, you can\u2019t call it average or mediocre or ordinary. A rating of 7 out of 10 is seen as a condemnation. Superlatives are wasted like water down the storm drains. \u201cI am having a disturbing vision involving a lemon-yellow Australia shirt slithering off David Boon\u2019s broad and hairy chest before he reaches for a squiggly-writing \u201claaaaaaady\u2019s\u201d shirt, saying \u201cDon\u2019t judge me\u201d as Jonny Bairstow looks at him askance, moodily handling a pair of purple sparkly balls. The rain means I might now get to bed this evening here in Australia but that vision has now ruined any chance I have of sleep. Cheers, Geoff.\u201d Jane Evans, that sounds more like a dream to me. Jump straight in the middle of that situation. A melange of eras, a meld of minds. Adventures on the astral plane beat commutes on the bus. I think it has stopped raining in the most immediate sense, because the ground staff are out there sweeping water to the edges of the covers, but I\u2019m sure it will start again soon enough. Thanks to David Peacock for unearthing the Brendan Taylor report. I assume it was a dealership promotion where you get one Zimbabwe player for free with each purchase. \u201cThere\u2019s nearly always live sport at Lord\u2019s if you know where to look,\u201d writes Michael Keane. \u201cHaving done the shop, if you you get really desperate you can pop in to the real tennis court. Spare a thought for the players though - the roof has had a leak for quite a few weeks and that floor gets slippy.\u201d I will be in there within the hour, I reckon. Alastair Ferguson is the fastest gun in the West. If someone can send me the TMS overseas link, I\u2019ll disseminate it more widely. Better yet, tell me where to find it on an ongoing basis. \u201cThe best rain delay I experienced was at a one-day cup semi final between Notts and Durham at the Home of Cricket (Trent Bridge),\u201d writes Daniel Dalby. \u201cMy friend and I met Paul Collingwood and Samit Patel (a true cricket legend) early doors. Due to certain contacts that I wouldn\u2019t like to incriminate we had a half-price bar for the day. The heavens opened from 3 until 7, and the match was reduced to 20 overs a side. Samit Patel ripped through the Durham top order and smashed the ball to all corners. My friend was seen on local news, dancing to celebrate a six behind a very serious Mick Newell interview. I think the Notts players had a similar time, based on us seeing them in a bar later in the day and Brendan Taylor waking up the following morning in a stranger\u2019s car in West Bridgeford.\u201d Ryan Loonan went to quite some lengths to watch Lancashire play in a T20 quarter-final at Old Trafford. \u201cI arrived on Friday, it rained, it rained a bit more, and we were told to return the next day to do it all over again. Saturday came and rain was in the air. The game started at 14:00 and stopped 4 or 5 times, each one a swift shower followed by a 45-minute mopping up job. The thousand or so people in the ground got pretty efficient in their exits from the stands. There were a couple of games of varying quality against the bins under the stands. Every time we thought we were getting somewhere, more rain would come, and people were trying to find ball by ball DLS targets. At around 7pm, two days culminated in Glamorgan needing 15 runs to win off the final over. They scored 13 and Lancs won the day.\u201d Back in the day TMS was always at its best in the rain,\u201d emails JP. \u201cBurbling was happily raised into art. Reminiscence was especially purple and dewy-eyed and often rheumy-eyed. Titans of the past had a weather-fuelled space and soapbox in which to ferociously berate every misguided venture and sin of modernity and it\u2019s younger denizens. Gluttony abounded, and tippling too apparently. It was always something of a disappointment when the clouds parted and the (much less interesting) game could recommence.\u201d I rather enjoy the rain blogs more than the play blogs sometimes, if we\u2019re honest. More of a stroll, less of a beep-test sprint foreshadowing arthritis. I can pop upstairs and see how much tippling is going on in the TMS box. They do have a fair few magnums of champagne floating about for one of their awards. \u201cWhilst your piece about the umbrellas was almost poetic,\u201d writes Alistair M, \u201cI do wonder how many such pieces you can come up with for the rest of the day. When do you get to quit and do something else? Our cat isn\u2019t letting persistent, almost torrential rain prevent her from sitting in next door\u2019s garden. Clearly a better option than a house.\u201d Almost poetic. That\u2019s a review I would have accepted gladly when I wrote poetry. Never try to understand cats, anyone. You know that by now. As for the opening question, I will be here writing almost poetry until play is called off or until Rob Smyth carries my cold rigid husk out to the bonfire. \u201cThe 113 was the bus we took from home in Cricklewood during my 8 years of London life,\u201d writes Paul Blundell. \u201cIt was only for going to Lord\u2019s for whatever game was most interesting that summer that our backpacker\u2019s budget could allow. My overwhelming memory is it raining every time...\u201d Surely Mr Seaman should be able to handle some wet weather? Raymond Reardon has some helpful advice for us all. \u201cThe internet site for St John\u2019s Wood needs updating as it currently states that sunrise was supposed to be 5.45am. Also Geoff, if you are delayed at the liquid mood enhancer parlour today, also note that the last 113 bus today leaves at 0.38am Thursday.\u201d I\u2019m going to be sleeping under the desk, aren\u2019t I? Dave Adams has sent me a screenshot of the radar. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t look too clever, but it\u2019s moving slowly eastwards. Play by 14:30 is my super-optimistic shout...\u201d It\u2019s interesting, the English use of \u2018not clever\u2019 for something just being not good. Especially inanimate things or events or situations. It confuses my brain a bit because my understanding of cleverness involves intent. This is your linguistic thought for the day. And that\u2019s it. Your exciting tour through the Lord\u2019s shop. Don\u2019t say you haven\u2019t got your money\u2019s worth today. (I am expecting a kickback shipment of purple sparkly cricket balls to land at my door shortly.) I have been off round the ground again to curate some Top Quality Online Content\u2122 for you. One moment. Of course you can still email me or tweet me if you like. Let me know your rain stories. What\u2019s the most fun you\u2019ve had during a rain delay? What was the least? What was the smartest or stupidest time that you played the rain card the night before? One thing I\u2019ve learned a lot about this summer is umbrella etiquette. In Australia, it has to be raining for about three days straight before more than 0.1% of people remember to bring an umbrella out of the house. Here, the first drop of precipitation and bang: up go a forest of brollies. Then you have to work out footpath spacing and walking trails as everyone has a wider profile, and for the taller people among us there are a lot of metal spines at eyeball height. And yet it seems to work. People naturally take slightly wider berths and the umbrellas zip seamlessly between one another like a water ballet. It\u2019s a wonder to watch. Ok, I\u2019ve taken a tour on foot around Lord\u2019s to bring you the latest. It is... wet. Not Noah wet, but maybe a half-Noah. There were more people leaving the ground than coming in, which frankly seems like good common sense. The ones remaining are some hardy Australians who have nothing better to do because none of our Prime Ministers is being deposed right this minute. The covers are on tight and the runoff hoses are pouring torrents out near the boundary line. Let\u2019s settle in for more of the same. Good morning from London, buckaroos. Good other times in other parts of the world. Good different times again if you are simply astral travelling, beyond the plane of time as we understand it in a linear dimension. Good existence! I am not astral travelling, I am 113 bus travelling. It is absolutely tipping down with rain in London, and I fear this may be something we repeat an untoward number of times.",

The only answer is to refuse to let this inquiry end with Epstein\u2019s life. An independent investigating body must look at every decision that was made, and every person involved, in the lead-up to Epstein\u2019s death. Federal prosecutors have already said that they will continue their criminal inquiries into anyone associated with Epstein\u2019s alleged sex trafficking operation. I hope now that Epstein is dead, his accusers will push even harder in their civil cases against his estate (although of course his death may also create some uncertainty and fear in vulnerable young women). The saddest part of this story is that the many women who say they were abused by Epstein as girls are now unable to look him in the face and demand he answer for his alleged crimes. Thanks to Epstein\u2019s death, we may never get the full story. But every person who contributed to this spectacular failure must be held accountable. And every entity that was going after Epstein, from federal prosecutors to lawyers in civil court, should redouble their efforts. Epstein, a narcissist and coward until the end, escaped his obligation to face down the consequences of his abuses. His enablers must not be similarly relieved.",

China controls another part in the east.<br></p>\n    <p>India and Pakistan have gone to war a further two times over Kashmir, most recently in 1999. Artillery, mortar and small arms fire are still frequently exchanged.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How did the dispute start?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>After the partition of colonial India in 1947, small, semi-autonomous \u2018princely states\u2019 across the subcontinent were being folded into India or Pakistan. The ruler of Kashmir dithered over which to join until tribal fighters entered from Pakistan intent on taking the region for Islamabad.</p>\n    <p>Kashmir asked Delhi for assistance, signing a treaty of accession in exchange for the intervention of Indian troops, who fought the Pakistanis to the modern-day line of control.</p>\n    <p>In 1948, the UN security council called for a referendum in Kashmir to determine which country the region would join or whether it would become an independent state. The referendum has never been held.</p>\n    <p>In its 1950 constitution, India granted Kashmir a large measure of independence. But since then it has eroded some of that autonomy and repeatedly intervened to rig elections and dismiss and jail democratically elected leaders.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What was Kashmir\u2019s special status?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Kashmir\u2019s special status, given in exchange for joining the Indian union, had been in place since 14 May 1954. Under article 370, the state was given a separate constitution, a flag, and autonomy over all matters except for foreign affairs and defence.&nbsp;<br></p>\n    <p>An additional provision, article 35a, prevented people from outside the state buying land in the territory. Many Kashmiris believed this was crucial to protecting the demography of the Muslim-majority state and its way of life.</p>\n    <p>The ruling Bharatiya Janata party repeatedly promised to scrap such rules, a long-term demand of its Hindu nationalist support base. But analysts warned doing so would almost certainly ignite unrest.</p>\n    <p>On Wednesday 31 October 2019, the government formally revoked Kashmir\u2019s special status. The government argued that the provision had&nbsp; only ever intended to be temporary and that scrapping it would boost investment in Kashmir. Critics, however, said the move would escalate tensions with Pakistan \u2013 which quickly called India\u2019s actions illegal \u2013 and fuel resentment in Kashmir, where there is an insurgency against Indian rule.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What do the militants want?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>There has been an armed insurgency against Indian rule over its section of Kashmir for the past three decades. Indian soldiers and Pakistan-backed guerrillas fought a war rife with accusations of torture, forced disappearances and extra-judicial killing.<br></p>\n    <p>Until 2004, the militancy was made up largely of Pakistani and Afghan fighters. Since then, especially after protests were quashed with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/08/india-crackdown-in-kashmir-is-this-worlds-first-mass-blinding\">extreme force</a>&nbsp;in 2016, locals have made up a growing share of the anti-India fighters.</p>\n    <p>For Indians, control of Kashmir \u2013 part of the country\u2019s only Muslim-majority state \u2013 has been proof of its commitment to religious pluralism. For Pakistan, a state founded as a homeland for south Asian Muslims, it is the last occupied home of its co-religionists. <br><b><br>Michael Safi and Rebecca Ratcliffe</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Pakistan\u2019s foreign ministry said on Wednesday that it had asked the UN security council for an urgent meeting on the matter, while Khan has previously vowed to lobby heads of state over what he says are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/11/imran-khan-likens-global-inaction-on-kashmir-to-appeasing-hitler\">illegal actions</a> by the Indian government.

      "bodyText": "Pakistan\u2019s prime minister, Imran Khan, has threatened to \u201cteach Delhi a lesson\u201d and vowed to fight until the end against any Indian violations in disputed Kashmir. In some of his strongest words since Delhi revoked Indian-administered Kashmir\u2019s special status last week, Khan said the army was preparing to respond to anticipated Indian aggression in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. \u201cThe Pakistani army has solid information that they [India] are planning to do something in Pakistani Kashmir, and they are ready and will give a solid response,\u201d Khan said. \u201cWe have decided that if India commits any type of violation we will fight until the end,\u201d Khan said during a visit to Muzaffarabad, the capital of Pakistan-administered Kashmir, in a speech marking Pakistan\u2019s independence day. \u201cThe time has arrived to teach you a lesson,\u201d he said. Pakistan, which also claims Kashmir and has fought wars with India over the region, responded furiously to Delhi\u2019s decision last week to revoke Indian-administered Kashmir\u2019s special status. It compared the Indian government to Nazis and suggested they might carry out ethnic cleansing. Pakistan\u2019s foreign ministry said on Wednesday that it had asked the UN security council for an urgent meeting on the matter, while Khan has previously vowed to lobby heads of state over what he says are illegal actions by the Indian government. The response by other global powers has so far been muted. Millions of people in Indian-administered Kashmir remain without landlines, mobiles or internet access, 10 days after an unprecedented blackout imposed hours before India made its announcement. The territory will remain under a curfew on Thursday as India marks its independence day, a date usually accompanied by protests. Local media reported some restrictions would be eased after Thursday, but said the communications shutdown would stay in place. Delhi\u2019s decision strips the disputed state of Kashmir and Jammu of any elements of autonomy, removing its constitution and flag, and scrapping laws that prevented outsiders from buying land. The state will also be split in two. It is the most radical change in Kashmir since the region joined the Indian union, and many Kashmiris fear it will alter the demography of what is the country\u2019s only Muslim-majority state. \u201cIt\u2019s an existential battle now,\u201d the Kashmiri politician Shah Faesal told the Guardian on Tuesday. He was reportedly detained at Delhi airport on Wednesday. Other high-profile politicians, including Omar Abdullah, the scion of a prominent political family in Kashmir, and a former chief minister in the state, were arrested last week. Faesal said Delhi\u2019s actions were \u201can insult to the dignity of the people\u201d, adding: \u201cMy belief is that it will have immediate and long-term consequences. We will see ground mobilisation in the coming days and in the long run you will have sentiment of alienation going further and [it will] erupt.\u201d He continued: \u201cThe common refrain is that everything has finished. Everything has been snatched from us. These are the common lines on every Kashmiri\u2019s lips these days. We have no choice left but to resist.\u201d Faesal was previously held up as an example of how Kashmiris could succeed in India\u2019s mainstream. He left the Indian administrative service this year to launch a political party, the Jammu and Kashmir People\u2019s Movement (JKPM). Delhi\u2019s actions had destroyed any remaining trust in mainstream politics, he said. \u201cAnybody who used to promote the idea that it is possible to have a future with India \u2013 all those people are discredited today.\u201d About 500 people have reportedly been arrested since the security clampdown began, apparently to prevent disorder. Despite strict curfews and a heavy paramilitary presence, 10,000 people protested on the streets of Kashmir\u2019s main city, Srinagar, last week when the curfew was briefly lifted for Friday prayers. India has said the protests were not representative of all people\u2019s opinions, and has downplayed demonstrations, initially suggesting no more than 20 people were involved. BBC footage appeared to show huge crowds on the streets. The communications blackout and restrictions on movement mean there is a lack of independent information about what is happening in Kashmir. Satya Pal Malik, the state governor, told the Times of India the severing of communications was to prevent unrest. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to give that instrument to the enemy until things settle down,\u201d he said. \u201cIn a week or 10 days, everything will be all right and we will gradually open lines of communication.\u201d Agence France-Presse contributed to this report",

      "body": "<h2>FRANK VIEWS</h2> <p>Poor Frank Lampard. There he was on his flight to Istanbul, ready to settle down and plan his tactics for the Super Pot clash with Liverpool, when he heard tutting from the person behind him. It sounded like familiar tutting and he could feel his stomach tightening. He turned around and, sure enough, the seat was occupied by former football manager Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, who has made it his business to follow Lampard around in the style of the Harry Enfield character Mr You Don\u2019t Wanna Do It Like That, there to question and correct every decision by Chelsea\u2019s rookie coach, who could only sigh as his old boss leaned over and grabbed his tactical notes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/13/frank-lampard-chelsea-spoil-liverpool-super-cup-party\">Frank Lampard hoping Chelsea can spoil Liverpool\u2019s Super Cup party | Andy Hunter</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cOh no, you don\u2019t wanna do it like that,\u201d Mourinho said, crossing out the names of Kurt Zouma, Mason Mount and Tammy Abraham and replacing them with Ricardo Carvalho, Michael Essien and Didier Drogba. \u201cYou\u2019ll want much more experience against the European champions.\u201d Lampard looked at him quizzically. He reached for the paper, put Fikayo Tomori at centre-back and handed it back to his Portuguese chum. But Mourinho still wasn\u2019t satisfied. \u201cNo, no, no!\u201d he yelped. \u201cI do not think you want to play a raw young defender against Mr Roberto Firmino, do you? What you want is Branislav Ivanovic.\u201d</p> <p>Poor Lampard. On and on it went. By the time the flight was over Mourinho was asking whether it might be a good idea for him to take the team against Liverpool. After all he had been far from impressed with Chelsea\u2019s naivety against Manchester United on Sunday and Liverpool showed what they can do to teams who give them space when they beat Norwich City 4-1 at Anfield last Friday. And he\u2019s only trying to help. If only Lampard would listen. If only he\u2019d step aside. If only he\u2019d let Jos\u00e9 be manager again. Sigh. Ultimately there\u2019s only one path Lampard can take to put a stop to all this: he\u2019s going to have to send every youngster on loan, put 10 manly men behind the ball, refuse to let his full-backs cross the halfway line, turn the game into a sh1t on a stick and try to beat J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s side 1-0 on penalties.

Because of that, the hospitals did not get an influx until the fighting started to die down.\u201d Tamuna Sabadze, deputy director of operations for the International Rescue Committee in Aden, said that fighters allied with the Southern Transitional Council now controlled most of the city. \u201cTheir forces control the key parts of Aden \u2013 all the military camps and the presidential palace, and they already controlled the airport,\u201d said Sabadze, adding that only a small part of the city was now controlled by Saudi-backed government forces. She added: \u201cThe situation has definitely become more dynamic and unpredictable. \u201cFrom a humanitarian perspective that will have implications on everything from the importation of humanitarian supplies to dealing with different ministries to facilitate work. \u201cWe knew that divisions existed between the coalition partners because of the different interests Saudi Arabia and the UAE had in the region. But any further fighting and exacerbation between the warring parties would be devastating for Yemen.\u201d The latest outbreak of fighting has compounded an already desperate humanitarian situation in a country where, according to the UN, 22.2 million people need some kind of assistance, including about 8.4 million people who are at risk of starvation. Aden had been the temporary seat of the internationally backed government of Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi. However, last week\u2019s battles led to militia forces associated with the Emirati-backed Southern Transitional Council asserting control over large parts of the city. The events seemed to suggest serious emerging faultlines in the Saudi-led coalition after more than four years fighting for the internationally recognised Hadi government against the Iran-aligned Houthi movement. The Houthis control Yemen\u2019s capital, Sana\u2019a, and most populous areas. Hadi is based in Saudi Arabia, but his government, troops and allied parties ran Aden until the separatists, who have a rival agenda, overran government bases at the weekend. Following the fighting the interior minister of Hadi\u2019s government, Ahmed al-Mayssari, appeared to concede on Twitter that the UAE-backed southern secessionists had triumphed. \u201cWe acknowledge defeat and congratulate the UAE on its victory \u2026 but this will not be our last battle,\u201d he wrote. The new crisis in Yemen comes as analysts have begun increasingly painting the Saudi-led intervention as an escalating \u201cfiasco\u201d for Saudi Arabia and Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Writing on the Al-Monitor website, Bruce Riedel, director of the Intelligence Project at the Brookings Institution, described the confrontation in Aden as the \u201clatest in a long stream of strategic blunders by the Saudi leadership\u201d. \u201cThe victory of south Yemeni secessionists in Aden is another humiliating setback for the Saudi war effort and its commander, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. \u201cThe Saudi-backed government of Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi has lost its capital, further undermining its shaky claims to legitimacy. The Saudis\u2019 closest ally, the United Arab Emirates, was partially responsible for the secessionists\u2019 gains. The Houthis and Iran are the strategic winners.\u201d He added: \u201cThe Emiratis have built up the southerners for several years in Aden. When Abu Dhabi withdrew much of its own forces from the port city this summer, the secessionists were free to move against the Hadi government and rapidly prevailed. The Saudis will try to paper over the quarrel within the anti-Houthi coalition, but the damage is done to Hadi\u2019s weak regime as well as to the Saudi-Emirati alliance.\u201d",

Last month Sports Direct stunned investors by repeatedly delaying its annual results and eventually publishing them after the market had closed on a Friday evening.

KPMG cited conflicts of interest with its client base, something Ashley said he believed was not an \u201cinsurmountable\u201d issue. EY, he said, had shown \u201csome reluctance\u201d because it ran the House of Fraser administration process, in which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/26/house-of-fraser-poses-significant-challenge-as-it-posts-546m-loss\">Ashley bought the business for \u00a390m</a>.

The resignation puts Sports Direct in a difficult position as Ashley said in the report that the scale and complexity of the company means that only one of the \u201cbig four\u201d accounting firms \u2013 Deloitte, PwC, KPMG and EY - would be able to cope with its auditing requirements. However, he admitted that \u201cearly discussions\u201d with each of them over taking on the audit responsibility for Sports Direct had fallen flat. Last month Sports Direct stunned investors by repeatedly delaying its annual results and eventually publishing them after the market had closed on a Friday evening. The late publication included the bombshell revelation of a \u20ac674m (\u00a3605m) tax bill from the Belgian authorities. Ashley said Deloitte could not take on the audit work because it handles Sports Direct\u2019s tax compliance and advisory work, but he seemed unimpressed by the explanations given by the other big firms as to why they could not take on Sports Direct. KPMG cited conflicts of interest with its client base, something Ashley said he believed was not an \u201cinsurmountable\u201d issue. EY, he said, had shown \u201csome reluctance\u201d because it ran the House of Fraser administration process, in which Ashley bought the business for \u00a390m. Ashley said PwC has cited \u201ca reluctance to engage based on our ownership structure\u201d. The auditing business is under pressure to raise its standards after a series of high-profile collapses in recent years, including BHS, Carrillion and the \u00a394m black hole discovered in the accounts of Patisserie Valerie. Ashley criticised the \u201cbig four\u201d for being \u201cmore than happy\u201d to take on companies such as Carillion, which he said supposedly had good governance, while Sports Direct offers \u201ctransparency, true and fair accounts, and realistic communications and expectations to the market\u201d. In a joint statement with Grant Thornton, Sports Direct reiterated that it still aimed to appoint one of the big accountancy firms despite initial rejections. \u201cSports Direct has a longer-term aim of looking to engage a big four auditor in the future,\u201d the companies said. \u201cIn line with the audit profession as a whole reviewing their client portfolios for, amongst other reasons, audit profitability, during a period of increased regulatory scrutiny, GT\u2019s review of its client portfolio alongside SD\u2019s future intentions on engagement of a big four auditor has led to a decision by GT to not seek reappointment as SD\u2019s auditor.\u201d Sports Direct has now asked the government what its options are as it faces breaking stock market rules if it cannot appoint an official auditor at its annual meeting, according to the Financial Times. The business secretary, Andrea Leadsom, has the power to appoint an auditor to a quoted company if it cannot do so itself. If Sports Direct fails to find an auditor it will be the first major publicly listed company to do so. It emerged at the end of last month that Grant Thornton had told the Financial Reporting Council, the audit watchdog, of its plans to resign as Sports Direct\u2019s auditor. However, an official announcement from Sports Direct was only released to the stock market on Wednesday. The FRC is investigating Grant Thornton over why it did not disclose payments made by Sports Direct to a company run by Ashley\u2019s brother as a related party transaction in the accounts. The FRC\u2019s audit quality review team is also looking into how Grant Thornton valued Sports Direct\u2019s holding in Debenhams before its near collapse in June. Neil Wilson, the chief market analyst at Markets.com, said: \u201cInvestors have reacted to the latest sign of the complete and utter lack of control at the top.\u201d",

Scientists at Cornell University have found the \u201cchemical fingerprints\u201d of the rising global methane levels point to shale oil and shale gas as the probable source. Methane, levels of which have been increasing sharply since 2008, is a potent greenhouse gas that heats the atmosphere quicker than carbon dioxide. Researchers at Cornell said the carbon composition of atmospheric methane, or the \u201cweight\u201d of carbon within each methane molecule, was changing too. Robert Howarth, the author of the paper published in the journal Biogeosciences, said the proportion of methane with a \u201ccarbon signature\u201d linked to traditional fossil fuels was falling relative to the rise of methane with a slightly different carbon make-up. Researchers had previously assumed the \u201cnon-traditional\u201d methane was from biological sources such as cows and wetlands, but the latest research suggests unconventional oil and gas from fracking may be playing a significant part. The theory would support a correlation in the rise of methane in the atmosphere and the boom in fracking across the US over the last decade. \u201cThis recent increase in methane is massive,\u201d Howarth said. \u201cIt\u2019s globally significant.

      "body": "<p>Andrew Cannon\u2019s greatest ambition is to climb Everest. That, and to be happy, and perhaps live with someone some day \u2013 more modest goals perhaps, but until recently they all seemed equally impossible dreams.</p> <p>Cannon found himself cast adrift when life events forced him to return to the UK after 25 years teaching abroad. He struggled to adjust and find work, or even a permanent place to live. Last year, however, his path crossed that of Simon Boyle, an award-winning chef who, while volunteering in Sri Lanka in the aftermath of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, was inspired to do more for his own community. After a spell teaching cookery skills in hostels, Boyle set up <a href=\"https://beyondfood.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Beyond Food</a>, a social enterprise that, in its own words, uses food as a catalyst for change, hoping to break the cycle of poverty, homelessness and unemployment.</p> <p>As well as running introductory courses, Beyond Food recruits an annual cohort of people at risk, or with experience, of homelessness for a two-year apprenticeship with Brigade, the charity\u2019s restaurant near Tower Bridge, London. They graduate with an NVQ level 2 diploma in professional cookery, a prestigious work placement and an ongoing support network \u2013 their \u201carm around the shoulder, poke in the ribs team\u201d, as Boyle describes it \u2013 \u201cso they can focus on the job\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a747e565cb628dbaedfa1f135bc26e5bbf05e488\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a747e565cb628dbaedfa1f135bc26e5bbf05e488/0_225_7360_4417/1000.jpg\" alt=\"At Brigade: Dartmoor lamb chops.

Cannon, halfway through his first year, has a way to go yet, but thanks to the varied range of opportunities offered to trainees, in a couple of weeks he will be behind the stoves at <a href=\"https://meatopia.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Meatopia</a>, his very first food festival, held annually in Tobacco Dock. He is excited, and just a little nervous, but says: \u201cI think I will gain so much valuable experience.\u201d</p> <p>One of the things he is looking forward to most is the chance to taste food from the chefs headlining the event. Having helped Jackson Bristow of Cornwall\u2019s Nancarrow Farm at a preview tasting earlier this summer, he says he was \u201cblown away\u201d by the stuffed courgette flowers in particular. \u201cI had never seen those before \u2026 life has changed for me so much.\u201d</p> <p>He is likely to have a few more surprises in store: this year\u2019s festival is bringing together an eclectic line-up, which includes Amninder Sandhu of Mumbai\u2019s Arth, described by Marco Pierre White as \u201cthe girl with gold in her fingers\u201d; the American Bryan Furman, Georgia\u2019s king of barbecue, and burgers from Singapore pop-up Rosita\u2019s Deluxe, as well as cooks from all over Europe. It\u2019s a thrilling menu and Mat Kemp, the creative director of the festival, now in its sixth year in the UK, sees Beyond Food as the perfect partner.</p> <p>\u201cWe fly in chefs from around the world, and they will maybe come with just one sous chef, so we need to give them a team. Not only is the restaurant industry short of people training in kitchens, [Britain is] leaving Europe, where most of them come from,\u201d he says. \u201cBut what Simon does is just a bloody great thing, taking people in challenging situations and giving them something to do.\u201d Up and coming chefs are always keen to help out but Kemp believes the Beyond Food apprentices \u201cwill be hungrier than the others, maybe\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s a pressure fellow trainee Nigel Adams feels acutely, excited as he is to soak up knowledge and experience: \u201cI don\u2019t want to let anyone down, on one hand, and on the other everything\u2019s like a dream. I\u2019ve gone from washing dishes to working on the grill, and the pass [running the order system and overseeing the dishes going out to waiting staff]. My life\u2019s evolved so much in such a short time.\u201d Adams describes himself as \u201ca good person who made a huge mistake and paid the consequences\u201d. He spent time in prison and came out with substance abuse issues, but says: \u201cBeyond Food gave me a second chance in life.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c58bad6192c74e027ca502c31efbf20ebcdf36e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c58bad6192c74e027ca502c31efbf20ebcdf36e4/0_239_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Meatopia is held annually in London\u2019s Tobacco Dock.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Meatopia is held annually in London\u2019s Tobacco Dock.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Publicity Image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The trainees are also unusually well qualified for the challenge; Brigade is run as a serious operation \u2013 \u201cwe haven\u2019t opened up a back street caff: they\u2019re working in an amazing restaurant,\u201d Boyle points out. In a refurbishment last year, he decided to replace a more conventional setup with charcoal grills and wood-burning ovens; \u201cwe\u2019ve just got the one gas stove now\u201d. Cooking over fire is \u201ca great skill to teach apprentices\u201d and sets the restaurant apart from others in the vicinity. \u201cWe needed to offer something different. Quite often people think we\u2019re just wishy-washy do-gooders, but we\u2019re a strong business and we need to be because we take our profits and reinvest them.

Boyle, meanwhile, describes the trainees as some of the most positive, optimistic people you\u2019ll ever meet. \u201cIt\u2019s a gift, in many ways, working with homeless people. They\u2019ve lost so much in their life, they are just thrilled to be here.\u201d The two do indeed sound like they will go together like, well, meat and fire. Which is handy, because \u2026</p>",

      "bodyText": "Andrew Cannon\u2019s greatest ambition is to climb Everest. That, and to be happy, and perhaps live with someone some day \u2013 more modest goals perhaps, but until recently they all seemed equally impossible dreams. Cannon found himself cast adrift when life events forced him to return to the UK after 25 years teaching abroad. He struggled to adjust and find work, or even a permanent place to live. Last year, however, his path crossed that of Simon Boyle, an award-winning chef who, while volunteering in Sri Lanka in the aftermath of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, was inspired to do more for his own community. After a spell teaching cookery skills in hostels, Boyle set up Beyond Food, a social enterprise that, in its own words, uses food as a catalyst for change, hoping to break the cycle of poverty, homelessness and unemployment. As well as running introductory courses, Beyond Food recruits an annual cohort of people at risk, or with experience, of homelessness for a two-year apprenticeship with Brigade, the charity\u2019s restaurant near Tower Bridge, London. They graduate with an NVQ level 2 diploma in professional cookery, a prestigious work placement and an ongoing support network \u2013 their \u201carm around the shoulder, poke in the ribs team\u201d, as Boyle describes it \u2013 \u201cso they can focus on the job\u201d. The scheme has turned out 121 graduates so far. Cannon, halfway through his first year, has a way to go yet, but thanks to the varied range of opportunities offered to trainees, in a couple of weeks he will be behind the stoves at Meatopia, his very first food festival, held annually in Tobacco Dock. He is excited, and just a little nervous, but says: \u201cI think I will gain so much valuable experience.\u201d One of the things he is looking forward to most is the chance to taste food from the chefs headlining the event. Having helped Jackson Bristow of Cornwall\u2019s Nancarrow Farm at a preview tasting earlier this summer, he says he was \u201cblown away\u201d by the stuffed courgette flowers in particular. \u201cI had never seen those before \u2026 life has changed for me so much.\u201d He is likely to have a few more surprises in store: this year\u2019s festival is bringing together an eclectic line-up, which includes Amninder Sandhu of Mumbai\u2019s Arth, described by Marco Pierre White as \u201cthe girl with gold in her fingers\u201d; the American Bryan Furman, Georgia\u2019s king of barbecue, and burgers from Singapore pop-up Rosita\u2019s Deluxe, as well as cooks from all over Europe. It\u2019s a thrilling menu and Mat Kemp, the creative director of the festival, now in its sixth year in the UK, sees Beyond Food as the perfect partner. \u201cWe fly in chefs from around the world, and they will maybe come with just one sous chef, so we need to give them a team. Not only is the restaurant industry short of people training in kitchens, [Britain is] leaving Europe, where most of them come from,\u201d he says. \u201cBut what Simon does is just a bloody great thing, taking people in challenging situations and giving them something to do.\u201d Up and coming chefs are always keen to help out but Kemp believes the Beyond Food apprentices \u201cwill be hungrier than the others, maybe\u201d. It\u2019s a pressure fellow trainee Nigel Adams feels acutely, excited as he is to soak up knowledge and experience: \u201cI don\u2019t want to let anyone down, on one hand, and on the other everything\u2019s like a dream. I\u2019ve gone from washing dishes to working on the grill, and the pass [running the order system and overseeing the dishes going out to waiting staff]. My life\u2019s evolved so much in such a short time.\u201d Adams describes himself as \u201ca good person who made a huge mistake and paid the consequences\u201d. He spent time in prison and came out with substance abuse issues, but says: \u201cBeyond Food gave me a second chance in life.\u201d The trainees are also unusually well qualified for the challenge; Brigade is run as a serious operation \u2013 \u201cwe haven\u2019t opened up a back street caff: they\u2019re working in an amazing restaurant,\u201d Boyle points out. In a refurbishment last year, he decided to replace a more conventional setup with charcoal grills and wood-burning ovens; \u201cwe\u2019ve just got the one gas stove now\u201d. Cooking over fire is \u201ca great skill to teach apprentices\u201d and sets the restaurant apart from others in the vicinity. \u201cWe needed to offer something different. Quite often people think we\u2019re just wishy-washy do-gooders, but we\u2019re a strong business and we need to be because we take our profits and reinvest them. We can\u2019t afford to hide behind our social enterprise status.\u201d His team will be relying on a wood-smoked, marinated goat dish at Meatopia to augment those profits, part of a menu rather more eclectic than one might expect from a meat feast, albeit an avowedly sustainable one. \u201cBack in 2013, you could stick some pulled pork in a bun and that was a dish \u2013 now it\u2019s a bit more complicated, more chefs have got involved with fire, and they\u2019re creatives, they\u2019re artists,\u201d Kemp muses. \u201cIf we filled the place with burgers and prime rib, we\u2019d probably make more money, but I\u2019d like to think we\u2019ve made people more adventurous.\u201d To this end, alongside the brisket and grilled oysters, there will be someone doing slow-cooked tendon, \u201creally soft and glutinous\u201d; tacos stuffed with ox tongue, haggis and bone marrow and even the sausages, from Hong Kong\u2019s Sausage Commitment, will be fermented (albeit in Spain in this instance, due to import restrictions). Kemp says the atmosphere they are aiming for at Meatopia is that of going round for a barbecue with some mates who are really good cooks, where there is a bit of music and someone who brings great beer \u2013 \u201cjust a load of happy people, basically\u201d. Boyle, meanwhile, describes the trainees as some of the most positive, optimistic people you\u2019ll ever meet. \u201cIt\u2019s a gift, in many ways, working with homeless people. They\u2019ve lost so much in their life, they are just thrilled to be here.\u201d The two do indeed sound like they will go together like, well, meat and fire. Which is handy, because \u2026",

      "bodyText": "Individual Australians hold more than $100bn offshore, spread across more than 1.6m accounts, according to new taxation office data collected under an international cooperation agreement. The Australian Taxation Office has already sent about 2,000 letters to Australians who it has identified have failed to declare $20m in income held offshore, telling them it knows about their formerly secret accounts, assistant commissioner Karen Foat said. In one case, an Australian failed to declare $28,000 in company dividends paid into an American account, she said. She said Australians who had investments overseas should declare them to the ATO to avoid penalties and minimise the amount of interest they have to pay on tax due in previous years. About 370,000 taxpayers have so far been identified as holding offshore accounts \u201cand this is just the beginning\u201d, she said. The ATO has collected the data under a program called the common reporting standard, under which 65 countries exchange information including account balances, names of account holders and income from dividends or asset sales. Countries in the scheme, which is part of a push by developed economies to stem the flow of money to secretive offshore jurisdictions, include the US, the UK, India, Italy and Caribbean tax havens the Cayman Islands and the British Virgin Islands. \u201cSome of them are our closer partners or jurisdictions that you might expect we already share information with, like the UK, and some of them perhaps people might have thought of as tax havens and the like in the past \u2013 Bermuda, Luxembourg and places like that as well,\u201d Foat said. She said the ATO received the first tranche of information in September last year but this was the first full tax year in which the system was providing data. Many people might have been born outside Australia or have spent some time working overseas and forgotten that they had offshore accounts or investments, she said. \u201cIt might just be a bank account, it might be a property or a share in a family business and they kept that when they came back to Australia,\u201d she said. She said some people might not realise that even a small amount of overseas income needed to be declared in Australia. \u201cWhen we look at the individuals tax gap of $8.7bn \u2013 so that means we think there\u2019s about $8.7bn in tax that\u2019s not being paid by Australian individuals \u2026 what that\u2019s actually made up of is lots of small amounts. \u201cSo, when people are forgetting to declare a little bit, and they\u2019re under-paying their tax by a little bit, that across a big population [of] 10 million individuals not in business, that\u2019s $8.7bn.\u201d The 2,000 letters sent so far resulted in taxpayers declaring an additional $500,000 in income, she said. But she said the ATO did not yet have an estimate of how much extra tax it could raise from the data-matching project as a whole. She said she was not surprised to discover Australians had so much wealth stashed overseas. \u201cGlobalisation means the world\u2019s getting smaller, lots of people travelling more, the digital world kind of means it\u2019s easier to interact with overseas than it might have been in years gone by,\u201d she said.",

      "body": "<p>Well, that didn\u2019t last long. When Boris Johnson entered Downing Street last month, there had been a hope among his supporters that internal Tory critics would give him the summer to get settled in, before airing any differences when parliament returns in September. That was not to be. Philip Hammond has today concluded that three weeks was plenty of time for the summer Brexit truce. The former chancellor has used <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/philip-hammond-to-say-that-people-voted-for-hard-brexit-simply-isnt-true-l82rhd3cm\" title=\"\">an op-ed in the Times</a> to voice his concerns about the new prime minister\u2019s strategy, arguing that a no-deal Brexit would be \u201cas much of a betrayal\u201d as remaining in the EU.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If an election does occur, Hammond and other anti-no-deal MPs will need to consider how they plan to position themselves</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Hammond lambasts Johnson for moving from demanding changes to the backstop to demanding its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/30/johnson-varadkar-clash-over-irish-backstop-phone-call-brexit\" title=\"\">total removal</a> which he describes as \u201ca pivot from a tough negotiating stance to a wrecking one\u201d. He also appears to find time to criticise the role of Johnson\u2019s senior aide <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/10/dominic-cummings-owns-farm-got-eu-subsidy\" title=\"\">Dominic Cummings</a> \u2013 formerly the campaign director of Vote Leave \u2013 warning against \u201cunelected people\u201d who are given the power to \u201cpull the strings\u201d of government.</p> <p>The aim of Hammond\u2019s intervention is to pressure Johnson to work towards a Brexit deal rather than continue the current standoff he appears to be in with the EU \u2013 refusing to talk about a deal until the EU agrees to ditch the backstop. For all of Johnson\u2019s talk in the leadership contest about the chances of no deal being a million to one, many even in his own government are treating it as the working assumption.</p> <p>Those who still think a deal is possible believe it will only happen if the government can survive the first two weeks of September when parliament returns and MPs work to try to stop no deal through various legislative means. This morning <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/14/philip-hammond-mps-can-stop-boris-johnson-delivering-no-deal-brexit\" title=\"\">Hammond said he was confident</a> MPs would succeed in stopping no deal.

      "bodyText": "Well, that didn\u2019t last long. When Boris Johnson entered Downing Street last month, there had been a hope among his supporters that internal Tory critics would give him the summer to get settled in, before airing any differences when parliament returns in September. That was not to be. Philip Hammond has today concluded that three weeks was plenty of time for the summer Brexit truce. The former chancellor has used an op-ed in the Times to voice his concerns about the new prime minister\u2019s strategy, arguing that a no-deal Brexit would be \u201cas much of a betrayal\u201d as remaining in the EU. Hammond lambasts Johnson for moving from demanding changes to the backstop to demanding its total removal which he describes as \u201ca pivot from a tough negotiating stance to a wrecking one\u201d. He also appears to find time to criticise the role of Johnson\u2019s senior aide Dominic Cummings \u2013 formerly the campaign director of Vote Leave \u2013 warning against \u201cunelected people\u201d who are given the power to \u201cpull the strings\u201d of government. The aim of Hammond\u2019s intervention is to pressure Johnson to work towards a Brexit deal rather than continue the current standoff he appears to be in with the EU \u2013 refusing to talk about a deal until the EU agrees to ditch the backstop. For all of Johnson\u2019s talk in the leadership contest about the chances of no deal being a million to one, many even in his own government are treating it as the working assumption. Those who still think a deal is possible believe it will only happen if the government can survive the first two weeks of September when parliament returns and MPs work to try to stop no deal through various legislative means. This morning Hammond said he was confident MPs would succeed in stopping no deal. However, the majority of MPs and government figures are on the fence as to how such efforts will play out. While there\u2019s a majority in parliament against no deal (Hammond\u2019s intervention comes as a letter leaks from 20 Conservative MPs warning Johnson not to pursue no deal), it\u2019s still unclear what mechanism they can unite around to stop it.

Following Christian Eriksen\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/10/tottenham-aston-villa-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">match-winning cameo</a> from the substitutes\u2019 bench against the newly-promoted side on Saturday a list of pundits from Jamie Redknapp to Pascal Chimbonda have warned Tottenham that if they lose the influential midfielder this season that elusive first trophy under Mauricio Pochettino may never come about.</p> <p>Pochettino himself has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/09/mauricio-pochettino-spurs-european-transfer-window-christian-eriksen\" title=\"\">spoken of his frustration</a> at the English transfer window closing while a player such as Eriksen is still available for the next couple of weeks should Real Madrid renew their interest, and in support of their manager\u2019s position Tottenham are understood to be willing to double the Dane\u2019s wages if he will sign a new contract worth a reported \u00a3200,000 per week. It is unlikely to have taken a second-half intervention against a tiring Villa side to alert Spurs to the value of Eriksen; the club are only too aware that he is now entering the final year of his contract and could talk to potential suitors about leaving on a free as early as January.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/09/mauricio-pochettino-spurs-european-transfer-window-christian-eriksen\">Spurs \u2018vulnerable\u2019 to bids for players from Europe, says Mauricio Pochettino</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Should Eriksen run his contract down Juventus could be a likely destination. The patient Italian club have established picking up quality players for next to nothing as a virtual modus operandi in recent years, and there is no doubt that Eriksen is good enough to follow the route taken by Paul Pogba, Aaron Ramsey and Emre Can out of English football in the past. That would be a disappointment for Spurs, and their hard-nosed chairman Daniel Levy, as selling Eriksen to Real Madrid before the European window closes on 2 September would be preferable to losing such an important player for nothing.</p> <p>Three options are open to Eriksen, who has said he feels ready for a new challenge. He can stay where he is for more money, wait until the end of the season to leave on a free, or consider any offer that comes in over the next week or two. The trouble with the third option is that it is not really an option at all until Real Madrid or someone else make a move. While it is likely that initial discussions have taken place at some level behind the scenes, with Real Madrid adopting their usual ploy of letting the world know they are interested in signing a player then going quiet on the matter as the deadline approaches, the long-mooted move to Spain is for the moment out of the player\u2019s hands.</p> <p>Despite the handsome offer of a new contract, Spurs would not really expect to be able to fight off a serious bid from Real Madrid, should one actually materialise in the next few days. Eriksen has been at Tottenham for six years and anyone could understand a 27-year-old finding the chance of a move to the Bernab\u00e9u hard to turn down. From a purely financial point of view a firm cash offer from the Spanish giants would suit everyone best apart from Pochettino, even if Spurs wish to be seen to be trying their utmost to keep the player, but will one arrive now Real appear to have cooled their interest?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5a1fb6c06523ce3ca9139d00dcc7d980c3e2eb82\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a1fb6c06523ce3ca9139d00dcc7d980c3e2eb82/0_145_4299_2580/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paul Pogba, seen here with Mike Phelan, is another player who Real Madrid are interested in and could possibly sign before 2 September.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paul Pogba, seen here with Mike Phelan, is another player who Real Madrid are interested in and could possibly sign before 2 September.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BPI/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Still in the market for Pogba, on whom Zinedine Zidane is thought to be more keen, Real are not in desperate need of midfield reinforcement, and why should they pay out now for a player who will be available for nothing next season? Even were Eriksen to sign a new contract at Spurs it is believed he would insert a clause enabling him to move to Spain or Italy should an offer of a certain size come in, yet though that would earn him a substantial pay rise and represent the best of all worlds for the individual, the scenario is nowhere near as attractive to potential foreign buyers as biding their time and talking to him as a free agent in January.</p> <p>What should a club like Tottenham do in these situations? Resign themselves to losing the player is usually the answer. Ian Wright has said Spurs need to do something to prevent key players leaving for nothing, without offering any advice as to the best way of achieving that aim. A footballer who enters the last year of his contract having resisted invitations to sign a new deal has probably made up his mind already, and the increased wages presently being bandied about are most likely just window dressing for public consumption.</p> <p>Tottenham will either lose Eriksen for a sum of money or they will get another season out of him on his present terms. There is no suggestion that he intends to sulk or cause problems if he has to stay another year in London.

      "bodyText": "Aston Villa ought to feel flattered. Following Christian Eriksen\u2019s match-winning cameo from the substitutes\u2019 bench against the newly-promoted side on Saturday a list of pundits from Jamie Redknapp to Pascal Chimbonda have warned Tottenham that if they lose the influential midfielder this season that elusive first trophy under Mauricio Pochettino may never come about. Pochettino himself has spoken of his frustration at the English transfer window closing while a player such as Eriksen is still available for the next couple of weeks should Real Madrid renew their interest, and in support of their manager\u2019s position Tottenham are understood to be willing to double the Dane\u2019s wages if he will sign a new contract worth a reported \u00a3200,000 per week. It is unlikely to have taken a second-half intervention against a tiring Villa side to alert Spurs to the value of Eriksen; the club are only too aware that he is now entering the final year of his contract and could talk to potential suitors about leaving on a free as early as January. Should Eriksen run his contract down Juventus could be a likely destination. The patient Italian club have established picking up quality players for next to nothing as a virtual modus operandi in recent years, and there is no doubt that Eriksen is good enough to follow the route taken by Paul Pogba, Aaron Ramsey and Emre Can out of English football in the past. That would be a disappointment for Spurs, and their hard-nosed chairman Daniel Levy, as selling Eriksen to Real Madrid before the European window closes on 2 September would be preferable to losing such an important player for nothing. Three options are open to Eriksen, who has said he feels ready for a new challenge. He can stay where he is for more money, wait until the end of the season to leave on a free, or consider any offer that comes in over the next week or two. The trouble with the third option is that it is not really an option at all until Real Madrid or someone else make a move. While it is likely that initial discussions have taken place at some level behind the scenes, with Real Madrid adopting their usual ploy of letting the world know they are interested in signing a player then going quiet on the matter as the deadline approaches, the long-mooted move to Spain is for the moment out of the player\u2019s hands. Despite the handsome offer of a new contract, Spurs would not really expect to be able to fight off a serious bid from Real Madrid, should one actually materialise in the next few days. Eriksen has been at Tottenham for six years and anyone could understand a 27-year-old finding the chance of a move to the Bernab\u00e9u hard to turn down. From a purely financial point of view a firm cash offer from the Spanish giants would suit everyone best apart from Pochettino, even if Spurs wish to be seen to be trying their utmost to keep the player, but will one arrive now Real appear to have cooled their interest? Still in the market for Pogba, on whom Zinedine Zidane is thought to be more keen, Real are not in desperate need of midfield reinforcement, and why should they pay out now for a player who will be available for nothing next season? Even were Eriksen to sign a new contract at Spurs it is believed he would insert a clause enabling him to move to Spain or Italy should an offer of a certain size come in, yet though that would earn him a substantial pay rise and represent the best of all worlds for the individual, the scenario is nowhere near as attractive to potential foreign buyers as biding their time and talking to him as a free agent in January. What should a club like Tottenham do in these situations? Resign themselves to losing the player is usually the answer. Ian Wright has said Spurs need to do something to prevent key players leaving for nothing, without offering any advice as to the best way of achieving that aim. A footballer who enters the last year of his contract having resisted invitations to sign a new deal has probably made up his mind already, and the increased wages presently being bandied about are most likely just window dressing for public consumption. Tottenham will either lose Eriksen for a sum of money or they will get another season out of him on his present terms. There is no suggestion that he intends to sulk or cause problems if he has to stay another year in London. That is not the worst set of circumstances a club could be faced with, and Tottenham need to find a way to make the best of it then move on. That seems to be what the player hopes to do, but players are not the only participants in this game who can be invigorated by new challenges. The challenge for Spurs at the moment is to show that no one is irreplaceable, not even a playmaker of Eriksen\u2019s class.",

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to launch a regular \u201cpeople\u2019s prime minister\u2019s questions\u201d slot on Facebook shows how political parties are increasingly able to bypass journalists\u2019 scrutiny \u2013 confident that traditional media outlets will, in any eventuality, still report on sanitised official broadcasts. The attraction of this approach for Downing Street is clear. Why bother holding a regular prime ministerial press conference for Westminster journalists who will ask about tricky subjects if you can select the questions yourself? Why bother trying to influence traditional media outlets by submitting the prime minister to a tough one-on-one interview that could backfire \u2013 as Johnson found out during an excruciating encounter with Eddie Mair in 2013 \u2013 when you can cut out the middleman and reach the audience directly? And why bother inviting cameras from the BBC or ITV to Downing Street when No 10 officials can frame the camera shot themselves? This way they can portray Johnson exactly as they wish. Johnson\u2019s first Facebook event saw him promising to answer \u201cunpasteurised and unmediated\u201d questions, in a visual style instantly recognisable to people used to watching YouTubers rather than traditional political interviews. Just like an online influencer promoting their personal brand, there was a relentless positivity in Johnson\u2019s responses and no comeback from the people asking the questions. There was certainly no detailed scrutiny of Johnson\u2019s funding figures or ambitious claims. The strategy is being shaped by Chloe Westley, Downing Street\u2019s new digital adviser, a 20-something former Vote Leave campaigner who until recently was at the Taxpayers\u2019 Alliance. Westley \u2013 who once praised the far-right anti-Islam activist Anne Marie Waters \u2013 has close links to Turning Point UK, the British arm of a pro-Donald Trump youth organisation. She is part of an influx of young Downing Street advisers who are used to fighting their corner on Twitter and know how to create a social media storm by highlighting divisive cultural issues in order to \u201cown the libs\u201d. Two months ago she recorded a spoof video for Turning Point UK entitled Shit Champagne Socialists Say, in which the lefties portrayed came out with lines such as \u201cis there wheat in this?\u201d, \u201chonestly this new Spotify playlist is amazing\u201d and \u201chave you finished with your copy of the Guardian?\u201d It provoked a largely negative reaction on Twitter, which after all may have been the intention in a media ecosystem where attention at any cost is considered a success. The live audience for the prime minister\u2019s initial Facebook broadcast was tiny \u2013 fewer than 50,000 views in the first half hour \u2013 but in an election, boosted by relatively cheap Facebook advertising, such a broadcast could easily reach millions. More importantly, Downing Street is confident that broadcasters and news outlets starved of their own access to politicians will end up using the footage and quotes regardless.

      "bodyText": "A giant penguin that stood as tall as a person has been identified from fossil leg bones discovered by an amateur palaeontologist on New Zealand\u2019s South Island. At 1.6 metres and 80kg (12st), the new species, Crossvallia waiparensis, was four times as heavy and 40cm taller than the emperor penguin, the largest living penguin. The penguin joins other oversized but extinct New Zealand birds including the world\u2019s largest parrot, an eagle with a three-metre wingspan, 3.6 metre-tall moa birds and other giant penguins. Enormous penguins are believed to have rapidly evolved in the Palaeocene epoch \u2013 between 66 and 56m years ago \u2013 after the dinosaurs disappeared and large marine reptiles also vanished from southern hemisphere waters that were much warmer than today. The giant penguin was identified as new to science by a team from Canterbury Museum in Christchurch and Senckenberg natural history museum in Frankfurt after bones were found by Leigh Love, an amateur palaeontologist, at Waipara. It is the fifth ancient penguin species described from fossils uncovered at Waipara, where a river cuts into a cliff of greensand. According to researchers, the penguin\u2019s leg bones suggest its feet played a greater role in swimming than those of modern penguins. It is not clear why the giant penguins disappeared from the oceans millions of years ago but it may be linked to the arrival of large marine competitors such as seals and toothed whales. The new species is similar to another prehistoric giant penguin, Crossvallia unienwillia, which was identified from a fossilised partial skeleton found in the Cross Valley in Antarctica in 2000. Dr Vanesa De Pietri, a natural history curator at Canterbury Museum, said the discovery of a second giant penguin from the Palaeocene was further evidence of the large size of ancient penguins. \u201cIt further reinforces our theory that penguins attained a giant size very early in their evolution,\u201d she said.

But personally, the overriding emotion I feel at the moment is pride. I\u2019m incredibly proud that these 31 players get to represent our country as the most diverse England World Cup squad ever selected.</p> <p>More than a third of the players in the squad are from BAME backgrounds. There are so many different cultures but they are all united by the purpose of representing England. It is a true reflection of modern society and what pleases me most is how it has come about naturally. There has not been any box-ticking or anything like that, this is Eddie\u2019s best 31 on merit.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/13/lewis-ludlam-interview\">Lewis Ludlam: \u2018This time last year I was fighting for a club contract\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Rugby has always been seen as a white, middle-class sport in England. That was the case when I played the game. I believe it still is. I cannot say it was something that bothered me during my career \u2013 that\u2019s the beauty of team sport, you put everything to one side because you\u2019ve got a job to do as part of a team \u2013 but I just love the way that things are changing. It has not been forced or manufactured; it has just happened organically.</p> <p>Eddie often says to judge him on the World Cup and, of course, he is talking about success in terms of results. But, with the huge increase in exposure, in terms of the number of casual rugby fans tuning in, this incredibly diverse World Cup squad can succeed in changing the perception of rugby in this country and I just love that. We\u2019ve seen it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/15/diversity-strength-england-win-cricket-world-cup\" title=\"\">with the cricket team</a>, we\u2019ve seen how both the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jul/07/gareth-southgate-england-team-optismism-diversity\" title=\"\">men\u2019s</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/06/lonely-female-football-fan-england-womens-world-cup-team\" title=\"\">women\u2019s</a> football teams have inspired at recent World Cups and I hope Eddie\u2019s squad will do the same with upwards of 10m people watching. Put simply, the more diverse the squad is, the more relatable it is to the wider public.</p> <p>Eddie\u2019s remit is simple: to pick the best players, and that is regardless of where they or their parents were born. That goes without saying but I do think Eddie\u2019s own heritage and background helps, as does the fact that he has coached Australia, South Africa and Japan. He\u2019s a well-travelled man with so much experience and he understands different cultures.</p> <p>It is inconceivable a squad will come together and win the World Cup without being totally united and Eddie knows that. You need that shared mindset because team culture is absolutely everything in sport. That starts with the relationships you build with one another.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"65a021434c92dd471d05a58918611859b183aa2f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/65a021434c92dd471d05a58918611859b183aa2f/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"England squad\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">England players pose for a photo with school children during the World Cup squad announcement at Blaise High School in Bristol.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim Goode/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And this squad is not just diverse in terms of ethnicity. Look at two of the headline names in the squad \u2013 Lewis Ludlam and Ruaridh McConnochie. Both have such inspirational journeys to a World Cup squad. The usual route to international rugby in this country is to start playing the sport at five, go into an academy system at 11, progress through the club, play at all the age groups and then play for England. I\u2019m not sure you can say that about those two because this time last year Ludlam was fighting for a contract at Northampton. The Olympic sevens medallist McConnochie has had more XVs experience at an amateur level than professional. Their selection brings a lot of hope to a lot of people. It makes them so likable, because they\u2019ve had to work so hard.</p> <p>I\u2019d be lying if I said I don\u2019t have concerns about the unknown quantity of some players, simply because we do not know how they will cope in a competition as intense as the World Cup but the last thing I am going to do at this stage is criticise someone or write them off. This will be Eddie\u2019s fourth World Cup and I do believe that, when you combine that with the experience of John Mitchell, it will help to offset the fact that there is not as much experience in some departments of the playing squad.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2019/aug/12/eddie-jones-refuses-explain-england-world-cup-squad-omissions-video-rugby-union\" title=\"\">Finally, a word for those players who just missed out</a>. They can go into mourning for a week or two, or even longer if that is what they want to do, but ultimately that will not help. I narrowly missed out in 2011 and, speaking from experience, I would say you have to get yourself ready for if and when that phone call comes. It may never come \u2013 it didn\u2019t for me because there wasn\u2019t an injury \u2013 but I used the anger at missing out as motivation to prove people wrong. Myself, Chris Robshaw and Danny Care were all overlooked for that tournament but we hit the ground running at the start of the season and ended up as Premiership champions. It can be a driving force if you use the disappointment in the right way.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Whenever a World Cup squad is announced it elicits a lot of emotions: joy for those who have been picked, anger for those who have not, excitement for those of us eagerly anticipating the start of the competition \u2013 and perhaps a little bit of worry in this case at the risks Eddie Jones has taken. But personally, the overriding emotion I feel at the moment is pride. I\u2019m incredibly proud that these 31 players get to represent our country as the most diverse England World Cup squad ever selected. More than a third of the players in the squad are from BAME backgrounds. There are so many different cultures but they are all united by the purpose of representing England. It is a true reflection of modern society and what pleases me most is how it has come about naturally. There has not been any box-ticking or anything like that, this is Eddie\u2019s best 31 on merit. Rugby has always been seen as a white, middle-class sport in England. That was the case when I played the game. I believe it still is. I cannot say it was something that bothered me during my career \u2013 that\u2019s the beauty of team sport, you put everything to one side because you\u2019ve got a job to do as part of a team \u2013 but I just love the way that things are changing. It has not been forced or manufactured; it has just happened organically. Eddie often says to judge him on the World Cup and, of course, he is talking about success in terms of results. But, with the huge increase in exposure, in terms of the number of casual rugby fans tuning in, this incredibly diverse World Cup squad can succeed in changing the perception of rugby in this country and I just love that. We\u2019ve seen it with the cricket team, we\u2019ve seen how both the men\u2019s and the women\u2019s football teams have inspired at recent World Cups and I hope Eddie\u2019s squad will do the same with upwards of 10m people watching. Put simply, the more diverse the squad is, the more relatable it is to the wider public. Eddie\u2019s remit is simple: to pick the best players, and that is regardless of where they or their parents were born. That goes without saying but I do think Eddie\u2019s own heritage and background helps, as does the fact that he has coached Australia, South Africa and Japan. He\u2019s a well-travelled man with so much experience and he understands different cultures. It is inconceivable a squad will come together and win the World Cup without being totally united and Eddie knows that. You need that shared mindset because team culture is absolutely everything in sport. That starts with the relationships you build with one another. And this squad is not just diverse in terms of ethnicity. Look at two of the headline names in the squad \u2013 Lewis Ludlam and Ruaridh McConnochie. Both have such inspirational journeys to a World Cup squad. The usual route to international rugby in this country is to start playing the sport at five, go into an academy system at 11, progress through the club, play at all the age groups and then play for England. I\u2019m not sure you can say that about those two because this time last year Ludlam was fighting for a contract at Northampton. The Olympic sevens medallist McConnochie has had more XVs experience at an amateur level than professional. Their selection brings a lot of hope to a lot of people. It makes them so likable, because they\u2019ve had to work so hard. I\u2019d be lying if I said I don\u2019t have concerns about the unknown quantity of some players, simply because we do not know how they will cope in a competition as intense as the World Cup but the last thing I am going to do at this stage is criticise someone or write them off. This will be Eddie\u2019s fourth World Cup and I do believe that, when you combine that with the experience of John Mitchell, it will help to offset the fact that there is not as much experience in some departments of the playing squad. Finally, a word for those players who just missed out. They can go into mourning for a week or two, or even longer if that is what they want to do, but ultimately that will not help. I narrowly missed out in 2011 and, speaking from experience, I would say you have to get yourself ready for if and when that phone call comes. It may never come \u2013 it didn\u2019t for me because there wasn\u2019t an injury \u2013 but I used the anger at missing out as motivation to prove people wrong. Myself, Chris Robshaw and Danny Care were all overlooked for that tournament but we hit the ground running at the start of the season and ended up as Premiership champions. It can be a driving force if you use the disappointment in the right way.",

      "bodyText": "And here\u2019s deputy political editor Rowena Mason\u2019s story on Johnson\u2019s Facebook appearance. That\u2019s all for today\u2019s blog - but as always, all the latest political developments will be on the Guardian homepage as they happen. From our media editor\u2019s analysis of Johnson\u2019s appearance: Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to launch a regular \u201cpeople\u2019s prime minister\u2019s questions\u201d slot on Facebook shows how political parties are increasingly able to bypass the scrutiny of journalists \u2013 while remaining confident that traditional media outlets will, in any eventuality, still report on sanitised official broadcasts. The attraction of this approach for Downing Street is clear. Why bother holding a regular prime ministerial press conference for Westminster journalists who will ask about tricky subjects if you can select the questions yourselves? You can read the whole piece here: Here is a summary of this morning\u2019s main developments: Boris Johnson has blamed a \u201cterrible kind of collaboration\u201d between people who think they can block Brexit in parliament and the EU over the failure to get movement on the withdrawal deal. During a 12-minute rapid fire people\u2019s PMQs broadcast on Facebook, he expressed confidence that MPS and Europe would come round because \u201cit\u2019s vital to get on and to do it\u201d A campaigner\u2019s attempt to bring a private prosecution against Boris Johnson for allegedly telling lies over the 350 million EU referendum bus claim has been rebuffed by the high court, which refused Marcus Ball\u2019s application to take the case to the supreme court. Ball, who raised more than \u00a3300,000 through online crowdfunding, insisted his fight was \u201cnot over\u201d. The former chancellor, Philip Hammond, has expressed his belief that parliament can block a no-deal Brexit. After saying withdrawal without an agreement would be a \u201cbetrayal\u201d, he told the Today programme: \u201cI\u2019m very confident that the means exist for parliament to make its voice heard and to pass legislation that gives effect to the clear view of parliament.\u201d The House of Commons Speaker, John Bercow, has said he will \u201cfight with every breath in my body\u201d to stop Boris Johnson from proroguing parliament to force through a no-deal Brexit without the consent of MPs. Here, in more detail (via PA Media), is Johnson\u2019s answer when he was asked during his people\u2019s PMQs how he intends to deliver Brexit on 31 October given the lack of movement from the EU and opposition from MPs. He said: There\u2019s a terrible kind of collaboration, as it were, going on, between people who think they can block Brexit in parliament and our European friends. And our European friends are not moving in their willingness to compromise, they\u2019re not compromising at all on the withdrawal agreement even though it\u2019s been thrown out three times, they\u2019re sticking to every letter, every comma of the withdrawal agreement - including the backstop - because they still think Brexit can be blocked in parliament. The awful thing is the longer that goes on, the more likely it is of course that we will be forced to leave with a no-deal Brexit. That\u2019s not what I want, it\u2019s not what we\u2019re aiming for but we need our European friends to compromise. The more they think there\u2019s a chance that Brexit can be blocked in parliament, the more adamant they are in sticking to their position. Johnson said he remains \u201cconfident we will get there\u201d and leave the EU on 31 October , noting: \u201cIn the end both our friends in other European capitals, and I think MPs, will see it\u2019s vital to get on and to do it.\u201d Q Who are your political heroes. A Johnson mentions Winston Churchill but also Pericles of Athens \u201cone of the most powerful articulators of the idea of democracy\u201d. He says that is why we will leave the EU on 31 October. And that is that. The quickfire nature of it meant there was little insight to be gained just soundbites with no details on policy nor fresh announcements. Johnson is flying through the questions with very superficial answers, it has to be said. Q How will he govern for everyone. A Power will be devolved and there will also be levelling off across the UK. \u201cOpportunity is unfairly distributed\u201d. He will invest in education, schools. Q Kyle in Stourbridge asks how he will protect and advance mental health services. A Johnson says he\u2019s been doing a lot about crime, which is often associated with mental health problems. He talks about social services, housing, police, councils - wraparound care. We need to be less afraid about talking about mental health issues. Q Sarah from London asks about tackling knife crime. A Johnson claims he \u201cgripped\u201d the problem while mayor of London, helping young people get apprenticeships, also increased stop and search. We are putting another 20,000 police officers on the street and increasing stop and search. Johnson refers to people saying it is unfair that BAME groups are overwhelmingly targeted. The PM says the best thing you can do to someone carrying a knife is to stop and search them. Q Nicky in Scotland asks how the PM will preserve the United Kingdom A It\u2019s the most important union of the last few centuries. Johnson essentially says he will talk up the union. Q Sam in Wales asks about an election. A Johnson says people are sick of elections. We will leave on 31 October. Q Amy asks what Johnson will do to restore people\u2019s faith in politics. A We\u2019re coming out of the EU on 31 October, people feel frustrated we haven\u2019t left the EU. Boris Johnson has started his people\u2019s PMQs. Q Luther in Cheshire has asked how he intends to leave the EU on 31 October with the lack of movement from Europe A There\u2019s a \u201cterrible collaboration\u201d between people who want to block Brexit and the lack of movement by our European friends. \u201cWe need our European friends to compromise.\u201d The more they think parliament can block Brexit, the less likely they are to compromise The European Commission has said Britain needs to explain its ideas on the way forward for Brexit if talks are to progress. Vanessa Mock, a European Commission spokeswoman, told a regular media briefing in Brussels: President (Jean-Claude Juncker) told Prime Minister Johnson on 25 July that we\u2019re available should the United Kingdom wish to hold talks and clarify its position in more detail. We\u2019re ready to analyse any concrete proposals that are compatible with the withdrawal agreement, and also ready to rework the future relationship as outlined in the political declaration. The UK knows well that our doors remain open to that effect. But for the talks to progress the UK government needs to explain its ideas on how it sees the way forward, respecting the commitments it took earlier in these negotiations. Asked if the refusal to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement also holds for any future British government, such as a Labour administration, Mock replied: Our doors are open to discuss with the UK authorities, I never said anything about refusal, but I won\u2019t go beyond what I said. Boris Johnson will be hosting the first \u201cpeople\u2019s PMQs\u201d at 12.15pm on 10 Downing Street\u2019s Facebook page today. Get your questions in now! The Conservative former attorney general, Dominic Grieve, who supports the People\u2019s Vote campaign for a second referendum, said he is encouraged by the number of Conservative MPs pushing back against a no-deal Brexit. He said: Philip Hammond is absolutely right to say there\u2019s no mandate for a disastrous no deal, and that for a government to try and force such an outcome on the country without the public\u2019s consent would be an outrage against democracy. It is encouraging to see more and more Conservative MPs, including many former ministers, reaching this view. We live in a representative democracy and parliament will have its say - MPs elected by the people will not allow an out-of-control government to impose no deal against the wishes of the majority of the public and of parliament. Philip Hammond\u2019s intervention makes that perfectly clear.\u201d PA Media has more details of Marcus Ball failing in his latest attempt to prosecute Boris Johnson over his EU referendum bus claim: The application was thrown out on Wednesday by Lady Justice Rafferty - one of the high court judges who quashed the original decision. In a brief announcement, she said: \u201cThis application for leave to appeal to the supreme court is rejected.\u201d Ball now has the option to apply directly to the supreme court for permission. Speaking outside court after the ruling, he said: \u201cThis isn\u2019t over, we are not giving up. \u201cWe are pursuing it, absolutely.\u201d Giving reasons for the high court\u2019s ruling in July, Lady Justice Rafferty said the \u201cproblem of false statements in the course of political campaigning is not new\u201d and that parliament had enacted laws to deal with \u201ccertain false campaign statements which it considers an illegal practice\u201d. However, she said this did not include false statements relating to publicly available statistics, and found that the district judge\u2019s decision would have \u201cextended the scope\u201d of the offence of misconduct in a public office. She also said it appeared that \u201cthere would have been no complaint\u201d if Johnson had used a figure of \u201c350 million per week gross, or 250 million per week net\u201d. Campaigner Marcus Ball has lost a bid to take his legal fight against Boris Johnson over the 350 million EU referendum bus claim to the supreme court. Ball who claimed Johnson had lied during the 2016 referendum campaign, crowdfunded more than \u00a3300,000 online to bring a private prosecution. The district judge Margot Coleman had issued Johnson with a summons on 29 May to attend Westminster magistrates court and face three allegations of misconduct in public office. However, after a hearing at the Royal Courts of Justice in London in June, Lady Justice Rafferty and Mr Justice Supperstone overturned the decision. Today, Ball found out that he had been unsuccessful in his attempt to take the legal fight to the supreme court. The shadow chancellor is among those who have come to Hammond\u2019s defence. Speaking on the Today programme, Hammond expressed confidence that parliament could block a new deal. He said: I\u2019m very confident that the means exist for parliament to make its voice heard and to pass legislation that gives effect to the clear view of parliament. It\u2019s very clear to me, and the Speaker of the House of Commons has also been very clear, that if a majority of MPs clearly want to go down a certain route, a means will be delivered to allow that to happen. He said: More than 17 million people did not vote to leave the EU with no deal. That is the key point here. There is no mandate for leaving with no deal. It is absurd to suggest that the 52% of people that voted to leave the European Union all voted to leave with no deal when, in fact, as the BBC itself has pointed out, during the referendum campaign there was virtually no mention made by the leaders of that campaign at all of the possibility of leaving with no deal. Hammond claimed Boris Johnson, echoing his public pronouncements had told him privately that he is determined to get a deal and confident that he can get one. However the former chancellor added: \u201cI fear there are other people around him whose agenda is different.\u201d This is the full text of the letter sent by Philip Hammond and others to the prime minister. The Johnson supporter and former Conservative party leader, Iain Duncan Smith, has hit back at Hammond, accusing him of undermining the UK\u2019s negotiating position by failing to prepare for no deal. Duncan Smith told BBC Radio 4s Today programme: By not preparing to leave with no deal, they made it certain that we\u2019d have to swallow everything that the European Union gave us. So the crime that has been committed in political terms was committed by him and those who did not prepare us to leave. Good morning, I\u2019m sitting in for Andrew Sparrow on the politics live blog today, bringing you all the latest developments as they happen. Philip Hammond has put the cat among the pigeons by saying that leaving the EU without a deal would be a betrayal of the referendum result. He is leading a group of 20 Conservative MPs who are making clear their opposition to crashing out on 31 October. Seven former cabinet ministers, including Greg Clark, David Gauke and Rory Stewart, have signed a letter to the prime minister in which they accuse the prime minister of setting the bar too high in negotiations with the EU to have a hope of getting changes to a deal. Hammond, writing for the Times, also took an apparent swipe at Dominic Cummings, Johnson\u2019s senior adviser, saying: The unelected people who pull the strings of this government know that this is a demand the EU cannot, and will not, accede to. In other developments: John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, reportedly vowed at an Edinburgh festival fringe event to fight attempts to sideline parliament \u201cwith every breath in my body\u201d. Labour\u2019s deputy leader, Tom Watson, has said his party must team up with the Liberal Democrats in order to stop a no-deal Brexit, as the new Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson made clear she would work with him, despite having ruled out an alliance with Jeremy Corbyn. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps said the government has issued an \u201cinvitation to tender\u201d for 300 million worth of freight in preparation for a no-deal Brexit. He said: \u201cWe may never need it, and that is my goal. But if we do, my goal is also to be fully prepared.\u201d Coming up later: Boris Johnson will be conducting a Facebook Live Q&amp;A session (we are awaiting exact timings). A campaigner who tried to prosecute Boris Johnson over his EU referendum bus claim is set to find out if he can take his legal fight to the supreme court.

      "body": "<p>\u2018I don\u2019t consider myself a great \u2018artist\u2019, but an entertainer,\u201d says Joe Scarborough. \u201cAfter all, I make things that people could do quite well without. So, I am like an entertainer at a working men\u2019s club, hitting those four or five gags to make sure they come back next week.\u201d This statement sums up the 81-year-old painter perfectly.

I am given the name of a boat and directed to the quayside, where I am told to ask after Joe in a cafe. Despite the fact it is lunchtime rush hour, the sandwich purveyor removes his apron and directs me to Scarborough\u2019s canal boat: \u201cIt\u2019s the one with all the paint pots outside.\u201d The boat is both studio and home to Scarborough, who sold his house in 2002 after his wife, Audrey, died.

The canvas already has all the hallmarks of a Scarborough classic: cartoonish with thick black lines and bold colour it fills Sheffield\u2019s industrial district with the vibrancy it would have enjoyed in the 1950s.

He began drawing as a child on the back of giant reports his dad would bring home from his role as an engineer in the steel works. At 18, he went down the pit at the Thorpe Hesley colliery, which was to transform his artistic practice \u2013 and not just because it forced him to turn to painting full-time after a rock fell on his arm. But the dazzling moment his eyes adjusted from the dark of the pit to the light of day altered the way he saw the world.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The dazzling moment his eyes adjusted from the dark of the pit to the light of day altered the way he saw the world</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cI saw the vivid change in basic colours. The green was emerald green, the corn across the Wentworth estate was hot yellow, the roofs were purple, and all the red brick buildings were beautiful. And, this is a dirty pit yard on an October day. It lasts for 15 seconds, that is all.\u201d</p> <p>Fifteen seconds is now Scarborough\u2019s target time for a viewer to stand before a painting. \u201cYour imagination works at a million miles per hour. All I need is 15 seconds and you do the rest.\u201d The 15-second rule should be the minimum because the level of detail in his lively paintings commands much longer viewing. Without a prolonged look, you\u2019d miss the girl with her arms open wide as her dad comes home from work or the flask of tea between two tired boat workers. Although Sheffield is the backdrop, Scarborough\u2019s real subject is its people.</p> <p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a bolt from heaven, but a slow realisation that, \u2018Joe, your subjects are right under your nose.\u2019 I became nosy and I couldn\u2019t stop observing \u2013 every time something happened, or I walked past somebody gossiping. You can build a 20x24-inch painting about a conversation on a bus. And I have done, many a time!\u201d</p> <p>Inspired by such directors as John Huston, who had a company of actors who would appear in multiple films, Scarborough\u2019s Sheffield-based \u201ccharacters\u201d reappear in different works, distinguished by their style of dress. A couple on a motorbike is sighted racing home from a day\u2019s work at Robert Sorby and Son; later they appear passing the canal. A woman in a smart pink two-piece is waving to someone outside a factory; elsewhere she is breaking up a fight. This recycling technique has developed a level of curiosity among his regular customers, who wait eagerly for the next painting to see what their familiar friends are up to.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"deb4837c58cbc0bfd9e379ae30090663e35c3747\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/deb4837c58cbc0bfd9e379ae30090663e35c3747/0_0_5944_4424/1000.jpg\" alt=\"5pm on the Canal by Joe Scarborough \u2026 note the reappearing motorcyclists.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"744\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">5pm on the Canal by Joe Scarborough \u2026 note the reappearing motorcyclists.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: joescarboroughart.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Across the decades that Scarborough has been applying paint to canvas, his beloved city has seen some dark days. Regardless, Scarborough\u2019s paintings have continued to burst with energy \u2013 is he an optimist? \u201cI think so. I like the idea of \u2018We\u2019ll manage.\u2019 So, \u2018I am out of work, but our Sheila has got a job\u2019 \u2013 that sort of thing. We are really good at cutting our cloth, especially in the north of England. The religion of the north is work.\u201d True to form, Scarborough continues to work every day from the quayside, where he gets ample inspiration from the toing and froing of a more modern type of office worker.</p> <p>And, like any good worker, Scarborough has ambitions; he\u2019d like to be on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/desert-island-discs\">Desert Island Discs</a>, and he sometimes daydreams about getting an OBE and meeting the Queen. \u201cShe\u2019ll say, \u2018I\u2019ve got a couple of prints of yours and they\u2019re magic.\u2019\u201d And out bursts the laughter that has given his paintings such life and humour for more than 50 years.</p> <p>\u2022 Scarborough\u2019s retrospective Life in the Big Village is at Weston Park Museum, Sheffield, 17 August-24 November.</p> <p><br></p>",

Born in 1938 in Pitsmoor, Sheffield, Scarborough\u2019s artistic training was of a singularly northern sort. He began drawing as a child on the back of giant reports his dad would bring home from his role as an engineer in the steel works. At 18, he went down the pit at the Thorpe Hesley colliery, which was to transform his artistic practice \u2013 and not just because it forced him to turn to painting full-time after a rock fell on his arm. But the dazzling moment his eyes adjusted from the dark of the pit to the light of day altered the way he saw the world. \u201cI saw the vivid change in basic colours. The green was emerald green, the corn across the Wentworth estate was hot yellow, the roofs were purple, and all the red brick buildings were beautiful. And, this is a dirty pit yard on an October day. It lasts for 15 seconds, that is all.\u201d Fifteen seconds is now Scarborough\u2019s target time for a viewer to stand before a painting. \u201cYour imagination works at a million miles per hour. All I need is 15 seconds and you do the rest.\u201d The 15-second rule should be the minimum because the level of detail in his lively paintings commands much longer viewing. Without a prolonged look, you\u2019d miss the girl with her arms open wide as her dad comes home from work or the flask of tea between two tired boat workers. Although Sheffield is the backdrop, Scarborough\u2019s real subject is its people. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a bolt from heaven, but a slow realisation that, \u2018Joe, your subjects are right under your nose.\u2019 I became nosy and I couldn\u2019t stop observing \u2013 every time something happened, or I walked past somebody gossiping. You can build a 20x24-inch painting about a conversation on a bus. And I have done, many a time!\u201d Inspired by such directors as John Huston, who had a company of actors who would appear in multiple films, Scarborough\u2019s Sheffield-based \u201ccharacters\u201d reappear in different works, distinguished by their style of dress. A couple on a motorbike is sighted racing home from a day\u2019s work at Robert Sorby and Son; later they appear passing the canal. A woman in a smart pink two-piece is waving to someone outside a factory; elsewhere she is breaking up a fight. This recycling technique has developed a level of curiosity among his regular customers, who wait eagerly for the next painting to see what their familiar friends are up to. Across the decades that Scarborough has been applying paint to canvas, his beloved city has seen some dark days. Regardless, Scarborough\u2019s paintings have continued to burst with energy \u2013 is he an optimist? \u201cI think so. I like the idea of \u2018We\u2019ll manage.\u2019 So, \u2018I am out of work, but our Sheila has got a job\u2019 \u2013 that sort of thing. We are really good at cutting our cloth, especially in the north of England. The religion of the north is work.\u201d True to form, Scarborough continues to work every day from the quayside, where he gets ample inspiration from the toing and froing of a more modern type of office worker. And, like any good worker, Scarborough has ambitions; he\u2019d like to be on Desert Island Discs, and he sometimes daydreams about getting an OBE and meeting the Queen. \u201cShe\u2019ll say, \u2018I\u2019ve got a couple of prints of yours and they\u2019re magic.\u2019\u201d And out bursts the laughter that has given his paintings such life and humour for more than 50 years. \u2022 Scarborough\u2019s retrospective Life in the Big Village is at Weston Park Museum, Sheffield, 17 August-24 November.",

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has hit out at what he described as a \u201cterrible collaboration\u201d between MPs and the EU trying to block Brexit, as he refused to rule out shutting down parliament and holding a general election after leaving on 31 October. The prime minister said the longer the standoff continued the more likely a no-deal Brexit was becoming, despite previously saying the chances of crashing out of the EU were \u201ca million to one\u201d given goodwill on both sides. Speaking live on Facebook, where he answered pre-selected questions from members of the public, Johnson appeared to be rehearsing an election campaign argument that the EU and pro-remain MPs will be to blame if there is no deal. His argument is that the EU will not offer any concessions if it believes parliament will stop a no-deal Brexit, and as such he claims that MPs opposed to no deal are actually making it more likely. \u201cThere\u2019s a terrible collaboration, as it were, going on between people who think they can block Brexit in parliament and our European friends,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd our European friends are not moving in their willingness to compromise, they\u2019re not compromising at all on the withdrawal agreement even though it\u2019s been thrown out three times, they\u2019re sticking to every letter, every comma of the withdrawal agreement \u2013 including the backstop \u2013 because they still think Brexit can be blocked in parliament. \u201cThe awful thing is the longer that goes on, the more likely it is of course that we will be forced to leave with a no-deal Brexit. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I want, it\u2019s not what we\u2019re aiming for but we need our European friends to compromise. The more they think there\u2019s a chance that Brexit can be blocked in parliament, the more adamant they are in sticking to their position.\u201d In reality, it is Johnson who is refusing to sit down for talks on a deal with the EU unless the 27 member states agree publicly to ditch what he calls the \u201cundemocratic backstop\u201d and provide a new agreement. Brussels has said the backstop is an essential component of a deal because it prevents a hard border on the island of Ireland, but critics say it could trap the UK indefinitely in a customs union. Johnson lashed out at MPs trying to stop a no-deal Brexit after Philip Hammond and 19 other Conservatives wrote to him expressing concern that he had set the bar too high for a revised deal by demanding red lines such as abolition of the backstop. The former chancellor said it was clear MPs could prevent Johnson taking the UK out of the EU without a deal on 31 October, calling it a \u201cbetrayal of the referendum\u201d and suggesting advisers in Downing Street have no intention of negotiating a new deal. Hammond expressed scepticism about the prospect of a national unity government taking over after a no-confidence vote, but said that if parliament was unable to agree on a way to honour the referendum result, a referendum or general election was inevitable. Any attempt to bypass parliament would provoke a constitutional crisis, he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme on Wednesday. During the Facebook live event, marketed by No 10 as a \u201cpeople\u2019s prime minister\u2019s questions\u201d, Johnson read out a question to himself about whether he would schedule an election for the days after Brexit is due to happen on 31 October \u2013 and declined to rule that out. \u201cI think the British public have had a lot of elections and electoral events,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was the election in 2015, the referendum in 2016, another election in 2017.

      "bodyText": "The government\u2019s energy emergency committee will give a verdict on National Grid\u2019s handling of last Friday\u2019s nationwide blackout within weeks. The business secretary, Andrea Leadsom, has tasked the government\u2019s Energy Emergencies Executives Committee with completing a review of the system operator\u2019s role in Britain\u2019s first major blackout in a decade within 12 weeks. The investigation is expected to establish what happened to cause the UK blackout and whether correct procedures were followed. It will also consider whether future power cuts could be prevented and how to minimise the impact of a blackout on people and essential services when they do occur. \u201cNational Grid has already confirmed that the incident was not linked to the variability of wind power, a clean, renewable energy source that the government is investing in as we work towards becoming a net zero emissions economy by 2050,\u201d Leadsom said. \u201cFriday\u2019s incident does, however, demonstrate the need to have a diverse energy mix.\u201d The emergency committee\u2019s first meeting since the blackout took place on Monday between officials from the government and the regulator as well as energy industry professionals. The investigation is likely to raise questions over standards agreed between Ofgem and National Grid that govern how the energy system is managed, as well as the role of regional network operators in keeping the lights on. Meanwhile, National Grid is \u201curgently reviewing\u201d what happened to trigger the outage, which caused \u201csignificant chaos and disruption to hundreds of thousands of people\u201d, Leadsom said. The energy regulator has demanded an interim report this Friday before a full technical explanation of the nationwide outage by early September. John Pettigrew, National Grid\u2019s chief executive, used his first interview since the blackout to blame regional network operators for making the rare outage more severe. He told the Financial Times that the investigation should look into why the networks allowed power to be cut to critical infrastructure such as railways and hospitals. National Grid has said that the rare blackout was caused by a sudden drop in the energy system\u2019s frequency - or energy intensity - after two unexpected generation outages within minutes of each other. In an interview with BBC Radio 4, Pettigrew denied that the grid\u2019s frequency had fallen to dangerously low levels with increasing regularity in the three months before the blackout. The claim contradicts data from the system operator itself, which shows that the grid\u2019s frequency fell to within 0.1% of its legal limits for the first time in years this summer. To safeguard the energy grid, the industry regulator expects National Grid to keep the grid\u2019s frequency at about 50Hz and no lower than 49.5Hz. The grid\u2019s frequency fell to 49.55hz on 9 May, 49.52Hz on 20 June and 49.58Hz on 11 July. Energy industry sources and experts agree that the energy system has become more volatile in recent years. Thomas Edwards, an analyst at the energy consultancy Cornwall Insight, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve observed that the fluctuations in frequency are getting wider.

Rosenthal was circumcised as an infant, a gratuitous and abusive act as far as he\u2019s concerned \u2013 and he\u2019s got the research to back that victim complex up.</p> \n<p>The resulting show packs a rhetorical punch and has laughs, too. Rosenthal takes a risk getting so het up on the subject, given that (as an academic he worked with is shown saying) we seldom take male circumcision \u2013 or the organ it affects \u2013 seriously. But het up he gets, leaving the conceit of the redundant foreskin in shreds. It is useful for sexual pleasure (giving and receiving), and sex without it is like watching a 3D film without the required specs. The medical benefits of circumcision are shown to be highly debatable, and easily secured in any case by, er, basic personal hygiene. (\u201cWash your dicks, guys!\u201d)</p> \n<p>Rosenthal knows that not everyone shares his views \u2013 several religions among them \u2013 and takes care to attack circumcision itself, not the cultures that practise it. But he does insist, with reference to witch-burning and slavery, that tradition is not a good enough reason to do a bad thing. The argument is made more compelling by his putting his own heartfelt experiences (teenage embarrassment; adult sexual inadequacy; the OCD circumcision may have caused) centre-stage.</p> \n<figure

      "bodyText": "Dick jokes are as old as comedy, but few \u2013 Richard Herring with docu-comedy Talking Cock excepted \u2013 dedicate whole shows to the subject. Step forward Plebs and Friday Night Dinner star Tom Rosenthal, with an hour-long diatribe about his own diminished equipment. Rosenthal was circumcised as an infant, a gratuitous and abusive act as far as he\u2019s concerned \u2013 and he\u2019s got the research to back that victim complex up. The resulting show packs a rhetorical punch and has laughs, too. Rosenthal takes a risk getting so het up on the subject, given that (as an academic he worked with is shown saying) we seldom take male circumcision \u2013 or the organ it affects \u2013 seriously. But het up he gets, leaving the conceit of the redundant foreskin in shreds. It is useful for sexual pleasure (giving and receiving), and sex without it is like watching a 3D film without the required specs. The medical benefits of circumcision are shown to be highly debatable, and easily secured in any case by, er, basic personal hygiene. (\u201cWash your dicks, guys!\u201d) Rosenthal knows that not everyone shares his views \u2013 several religions among them \u2013 and takes care to attack circumcision itself, not the cultures that practise it. But he does insist, with reference to witch-burning and slavery, that tradition is not a good enough reason to do a bad thing. The argument is made more compelling by his putting his own heartfelt experiences (teenage embarrassment; adult sexual inadequacy; the OCD circumcision may have caused) centre-stage. As Rosenthal admits, the polemic can overshadow the comedy, and that comedy is often of the dick joke variety. But it\u2019s still a striking show, raising questions and laughter in equal measure.

      "body": "<p>I\u2019ve always loved quest narratives, partly because they have such admirable purity of purpose: Must find grail! Must solve crime! Must defeat evil being! But then I lack such admirable purity of purpose, so my true affinity is with absurdist quests, a tragicomic sub-genre in which everything is awry, and the rules keep changing \u2013 if there are any rules at all. The bemused protagonist struggles nonetheless to find grail/solve crime/defeat evil being but they are constantly thwarted by the strangeness of reality.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jul/24/zed-joanna-kavenna-review\">Zed by Joanna Kavenna review \u2013 a brilliant big-tech dystopia</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Furthermore, the most important mystery can\u2019t be solved: the meaning of life. This leads to a further question about whether we can know if a quest is absurd or not, when \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.nybooks.com/daily/2014/11/04/borges-and-god/\">as Jorge Luis Borges wrote</a> \u2013 we can\u2019t even tell if the universe belongs to a realist genre or a fantastic one. While writing my latest novel<em> </em>Zed I was very influenced by this tradition. In my fictional world there has been a series of mysterious deaths; meanwhile everyone is grappling with a possibly related and unfathomable quantity called Zed. I wanted my characters to keep striving to find answers, even as everything falls apart. So here are 10 of my favourite absurdist quests \u2026</p> <p><strong>1. <a href=\"https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2012/12/20/magical-donkey/\">The Golden Ass, or The Metamorphoses of Apuleius by Lucius Apuleius</a> (late second century AD)<br></strong>The eponymous hero Lucius is meandering through life when he apparently murders three men, is put on trial and awaits his doom. Yet it turns out that he is the victim of a weird practical joke. Things become weirder still when he has a slight accident with some magic and is transformed into an ass. His quest is clear: to stop being an ass. The satire is robust; Apuleius knows that in any era of history there are many \u2013 some of them our most powerful leaders \u2013 who really should embark on such a quest \u2026</p> <p><strong>2. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jun/17/nikolai-gogol-collected-tales-review\">The Overcoat by Nikolai Gogol</a> (1842)<br></strong>This absurdist classic has inspired countless authors, film-makers, artists and musicians; Dostoevsky is reported to have said that \u201cwe all come out from Gogol\u2019s overcoat\u201d. The hero here, Akaky Akakievich, works hard at his clerical job even as his colleagues mock him for his unkempt appearance. His overcoat is threadbare, so he spends most of the story trying to gather the money for a new one. Having finally earned his prize, he enjoys a moment of pure happiness, and his colleagues even throw a party in honour of his coat. But the overcoat is stolen and when Akaky petitions the authorities they tell him to stop wasting their time. This represents the monumental outrage of Akaky\u2019s life: that no one cares what happens to him, and that his society is cruel and stupid.</p> <p><strong>3. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/quiz/2014/jun/03/franz-kafka-quiz-knowledge-trial\">The Trial by Franz Kafka</a> (1925)<br></strong>Another absurdist classic set in a terrifyingly cruel and stupid society. Josef K is suddenly arrested and told that he must stand trial. No one will tell him the nature of the crime he has allegedly committed, and he is tormented by a venal, relentless bureaucracy. It is the abrupt shifts of reality, and the claims by those in power that insanity is sanity and lies are truth, that make this novel so unsettling and timeless.</p> <p><strong>4. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/tartar-steppe-617446.html\">The Tartar Steppe by Dino Buzzati</a> (1940)<br></strong>Buzzati was working as a journalist for the <em>Corriere della Sera</em> when he perceived that his \u201croutine would never end and so would eat up my whole life\u201d. This revelation caused him to write a beautiful, bleak novel about one man\u2019s quest for meaning. Giovanni Drogo, a soldier, is posted to a remote fortress. His duty is to repel an attack by a mysterious enemy, the Tartars. He waits each day for the attack, scanning the wastes, but the Tartars never come, and the novel reads as a prose precursor to Waiting for Godot.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6b520124688f9e59fd9ca4cc55368d4ba0800110\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b520124688f9e59fd9ca4cc55368d4ba0800110/0_0_1846_2399/769.jpg\" alt=\"Ithell Colquhoun\u2019s watercolour Their Link Was Without Passion 1955, painted to illustrate Goose of Hermogenes.\" width=\"769\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ceaselessly inventive \u2026 Ithell Colquhoun\u2019s watercolour Their Link Was Without Passion 1955, painted to illustrate Goose of Hermogenes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Owen Publishing</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>5. <a href=\"https://www.peterowen.com/shop/goose-of-hermogenes-special-edition\">Goose of Hermogenes by Ithell Colquhoun</a> (1961)<br></strong>In this dreamlike and non-sequential novel, a narrator (\u201cI\u201d) finds herself on a quest to escape from her alchemist uncle, who is questing himself for the secret of eternal life. Throughout, there are ironic allusions to the fixated hero of the classical quest, who thinks of nothing but the golden fleece, the glittering grail or further prize. In Colquhoun\u2019s novel this fixed purpose becomes a sort of demonic magic, which warps reality in all sorts of fabulous ways. An extraordinary book from a ceaselessly inventive writer and artist.</p> <p><strong>6. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2008/sep/13/digested.classics\">The Crying of Lot 49 by Thomas Pynchon</a> (1966)<br></strong>Our heroine, Oedipa Maas, is drawn into a baroque mystery after the death of her ex-boyfriend, Pierce Inverarity. The impenetrable events are bound up with an organisation called Trystero, or Tristero, which might be a secret underground delivery service, with a slogan W.A.S.T.E. (We Await Silent Tristero\u2019s Empire). Yet there is a possibility that this organisation isn\u2019t real, and Oedipa is mad or the victim of a practical joke. This novel has much in common with the equally brilliant <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/mar/18/philip-k-dick-ubik-reading-group\">Ubik by Philip K Dick</a>, published in 1969.</p> <p><strong>7. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/sep/30/my-hero-flann-obrien-sansom\">The Third Policeman by Flann O\u2019Brien</a> (1967)<br></strong> A wonderfully ingenious novel that is often interpreted as an afterlife quest in which the unnamed protagonist is dead for much of the action. Either way, he finds himself in an insane universe in which characters are dead one moment and alive the next, and policemen talk incessantly about bicycles and the third policeman is omniscient. Brian O\u2019Nolan (his real name) finished the novel in 1940 but it was rejected as \u201ctoo fantastic\u201d. It was published shortly after O\u2019Nolan\u2019s death.</p> <p><strong>8. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/hearing-trumpet.html\">The Hearing Trumpet by Leonora Carrington</a> (1976)<br></strong>The British-born Mexican artist and author makes her questing heroine a nonagenarian, and lingers on the ruched contours of her ageing skin. People keep trying to confine Marian Leatherby, while she steadfastly ignores their prohibitions. It is absurd to be old and to be informed that you are \u2013 consequently \u2013 nothing.

      "bodyText": "I\u2019ve always loved quest narratives, partly because they have such admirable purity of purpose: Must find grail! Must solve crime! Must defeat evil being! But then I lack such admirable purity of purpose, so my true affinity is with absurdist quests, a tragicomic sub-genre in which everything is awry, and the rules keep changing \u2013 if there are any rules at all. The bemused protagonist struggles nonetheless to find grail/solve crime/defeat evil being but they are constantly thwarted by the strangeness of reality. Furthermore, the most important mystery can\u2019t be solved: the meaning of life. This leads to a further question about whether we can know if a quest is absurd or not, when \u2013 as Jorge Luis Borges wrote \u2013 we can\u2019t even tell if the universe belongs to a realist genre or a fantastic one. While writing my latest novel Zed I was very influenced by this tradition. In my fictional world there has been a series of mysterious deaths; meanwhile everyone is grappling with a possibly related and unfathomable quantity called Zed. I wanted my characters to keep striving to find answers, even as everything falls apart. So here are 10 of my favourite absurdist quests \u2026 1. The Golden Ass, or The Metamorphoses of Apuleius by Lucius Apuleius (late second century AD) The eponymous hero Lucius is meandering through life when he apparently murders three men, is put on trial and awaits his doom. Yet it turns out that he is the victim of a weird practical joke. Things become weirder still when he has a slight accident with some magic and is transformed into an ass. His quest is clear: to stop being an ass. The satire is robust; Apuleius knows that in any era of history there are many \u2013 some of them our most powerful leaders \u2013 who really should embark on such a quest \u2026 2. The Overcoat by Nikolai Gogol (1842) This absurdist classic has inspired countless authors, film-makers, artists and musicians; Dostoevsky is reported to have said that \u201cwe all come out from Gogol\u2019s overcoat\u201d. The hero here, Akaky Akakievich, works hard at his clerical job even as his colleagues mock him for his unkempt appearance. His overcoat is threadbare, so he spends most of the story trying to gather the money for a new one. Having finally earned his prize, he enjoys a moment of pure happiness, and his colleagues even throw a party in honour of his coat. But the overcoat is stolen and when Akaky petitions the authorities they tell him to stop wasting their time. This represents the monumental outrage of Akaky\u2019s life: that no one cares what happens to him, and that his society is cruel and stupid. 3. The Trial by Franz Kafka (1925) Another absurdist classic set in a terrifyingly cruel and stupid society. Josef K is suddenly arrested and told that he must stand trial. No one will tell him the nature of the crime he has allegedly committed, and he is tormented by a venal, relentless bureaucracy. It is the abrupt shifts of reality, and the claims by those in power that insanity is sanity and lies are truth, that make this novel so unsettling and timeless. 4. The Tartar Steppe by Dino Buzzati (1940) Buzzati was working as a journalist for the Corriere della Sera when he perceived that his \u201croutine would never end and so would eat up my whole life\u201d. This revelation caused him to write a beautiful, bleak novel about one man\u2019s quest for meaning. Giovanni Drogo, a soldier, is posted to a remote fortress. His duty is to repel an attack by a mysterious enemy, the Tartars. He waits each day for the attack, scanning the wastes, but the Tartars never come, and the novel reads as a prose precursor to Waiting for Godot. 5. Goose of Hermogenes by Ithell Colquhoun (1961) In this dreamlike and non-sequential novel, a narrator (\u201cI\u201d) finds herself on a quest to escape from her alchemist uncle, who is questing himself for the secret of eternal life. Throughout, there are ironic allusions to the fixated hero of the classical quest, who thinks of nothing but the golden fleece, the glittering grail or further prize. In Colquhoun\u2019s novel this fixed purpose becomes a sort of demonic magic, which warps reality in all sorts of fabulous ways. An extraordinary book from a ceaselessly inventive writer and artist. 6. The Crying of Lot 49 by Thomas Pynchon (1966) Our heroine, Oedipa Maas, is drawn into a baroque mystery after the death of her ex-boyfriend, Pierce Inverarity. The impenetrable events are bound up with an organisation called Trystero, or Tristero, which might be a secret underground delivery service, with a slogan W.A.S.T.E. (We Await Silent Tristero\u2019s Empire). Yet there is a possibility that this organisation isn\u2019t real, and Oedipa is mad or the victim of a practical joke. This novel has much in common with the equally brilliant Ubik by Philip K Dick, published in 1969. 7. The Third Policeman by Flann O\u2019Brien (1967) A wonderfully ingenious novel that is often interpreted as an afterlife quest in which the unnamed protagonist is dead for much of the action. Either way, he finds himself in an insane universe in which characters are dead one moment and alive the next, and policemen talk incessantly about bicycles and the third policeman is omniscient. Brian O\u2019Nolan (his real name) finished the novel in 1940 but it was rejected as \u201ctoo fantastic\u201d. It was published shortly after O\u2019Nolan\u2019s death. 8. The Hearing Trumpet by Leonora Carrington (1976) The British-born Mexican artist and author makes her questing heroine a nonagenarian, and lingers on the ruched contours of her ageing skin. People keep trying to confine Marian Leatherby, while she steadfastly ignores their prohibitions. It is absurd to be old and to be informed that you are \u2013 consequently \u2013 nothing. But blissfully, importantly, she refuses such doleful edicts and embarks on a wild adventure. 9. The Savage Detectives by Roberto Bola\u00f1o (1998) Two poets, Arturo Belano and Ulises Lima, are searching for another, Ces\u00e1rea Tinajero. This mock-detective quest is relayed by a dizzying cast of narrators, who disagree about almost everything. The prose is stunning, and full of lovely aphorisms such as: \u201cIn some lost fold of the past, we wanted to be lions and we\u2019re no more than castrated cats.\u201d This concisely describes the relationship between the absurdist quest and the lion-like heroic quest \u2026 10. The Fat Years by Chan Koonchung (2009) In a slightly sci-fi version of China, a month has disappeared from the official records and from collective memory. Old Chen, the central character (an idle, self-obsessed author who just wants to lounge around drinking Lychee Black Dragon Lattes) is persuaded by an ex, Little Xi, to find out what really happened in this month, and why the authorities want to erase it from history. A bold, exhilarating satire of the tech-totalitarianism of contemporary China. \u2022 Zed by Joanna Kavenna is published by Faber.",

On Thursday, Evelyn Beatr\u00edz Hern\u00e1ndez Cruz, 21, from a poor rural family in Cojutepeque, will go on trial for the second time in a case that highlights the aggressive criminal persecution of Salvadoran women who suffer obstetric complications. It is also the first trial since President Nayib Bukele was elected in June, six months after observing of the case involving Imelda Cortez \u2013 who was charged with attempted murder after giving birth to her abuser\u2019s baby \u2013 that no woman should be jailed for suffering an obstetric emergency.

She was freed in February, however, after serving 33 months in an overcrowded jail, when an appeal judge quashed the conviction on the grounds that the evidence presented at trial did not prove Hern\u00e1ndez intended \u2013 directly or indirectly \u2013 to harm the foetus. Prosecutors will now retry Hern\u00e1ndez on the same charge. \u201cWhy? Because in El Salvador all women are considered second-class citizens, and poor vulnerable women like Evelyn, third-class citizens, so the full weight of the justice system is thrown at them regardless of the evidence,\u201d said Paula Avila-Guillen, director of Latin America initiatives at the New York-based Women\u2019s Equality Centre. El Salvador is a deeply conservative country of 6 million people, where church leaders hold significant sway over public opinion and policies. Abortion has been illegal in all circumstances since 1998, when legislators from across the political spectrum voted to strip women of their reproductive rights without any public debate or medical consultation about the consequences. Dozens of women have since been prosecuted for homicide and manslaughter after suffering an obstetric emergency like a miscarriage or still birth. Like Hern\u00e1ndez, the vast majority are poor single rural-dwellers convicted on tenuous evidence. In many cases, the women were survivors of sexual violence and did not realise they were pregnant.

Wright, leader of new political party Nuestro Tiempo (Our Time) and one of the country\u2019s few openly pro-choice politicians, believes the president, who is anti-choice, should use his popularity to swing the debate toward decriminalisation. \u201cWhy does our political and justice system keep persecuting these women? Maybe the cruel punishment of certain women reflects the violent nature of our society \u2026 it\u2019s a matter of injustice and inequality, and the president should show leadership and make a public statement about this matter.\u201d The chances of legal reform are, however, slim, given that rightwing anti-choice party Arena and its allies hold a majority in the legislature. Campaigners nonetheless hope Bukele will create a committee to review the legality of all cases involving women jailed for abortion-related offences \u2013 as recommended by the UN human rights high commissioner in 2017. In the past decade, 41 women have been freed as a result of dogged campaigning by domestic and international human rights groups, including six \u2013 Teodora del Carmen V\u00e1squez, Mayra Figueroa, Elsy Rivera, Katherine Mazariego, Maria Lopez and Imelda Cortez \u2013 in 2018. A further 16 women known to activists are serving up to 35 years in jail; at least five others, including Hern\u00e1ndez, are being prosecuted. At an earlier court appearance, Hern\u00e1ndez, who pleaded not guilty for the second time, said: \u201cI trust God that I will be fine. I know that good things are coming for me, I am innocent.\u201d",

Fighting games had become incredibly niche, and ordinary gamers were no longer able to keep up.\u201d</p> <p>His idea was to abandon using button combinations to access special attacks. In Power Stone, players would need to know just three moves: punch, kick and jump. Access to powerful abilities would come via objects littered around the elaborate environments \u2013 players could throw chairs, tables and rocks, but also pick up weapons such as flame throwers and miniguns that would break after a few seconds of use.</p> <p>This move away from specialist knowledge and abilities and toward making powerful weapons randomly available to all players was an important element of the emerging \u2018arena battle\u2019 genre \u2013 a forebear of the Battle Royale dynamic. In Power Stone and its close contemporary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/02/super-smash-bros-review-nintendo\">Super Smash Bros</a>, players enter a match with the same items and abilities and have to search the map for the best stuff; all<em> </em>players, no matter how skilful, are at the mercy of the capricious world they\u2019re in.

Power Stone was all about dominating the active space and playing the objective (ie chasing after the items and power stones), while learning how to avoid attacks by using environmental barriers. \u201cThere aren\u2019t many weapons, and they break, so even if they caused a high amount of damage, they wouldn\u2019t break the game balance,\u201d says Itsuno. \u201cWe made the weapons powerful to encourage players to use them a lot.

Sensing the impending doom, Capcom switched the project to the Dreamcast and Sega\u2019s Naomi arcade board, which were both based on the same technical specifications. \u201cThis was Capcom\u2019s first time developing for those platforms, so it was definitely a trial by fire,\u201d says Tezuka. \u201cBut creating a new kind of fighting game on brand-new hardware made every day exciting.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"43fd6cc7a7e7edaeed6231905ce84deb3ee513c0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/43fd6cc7a7e7edaeed6231905ce84deb3ee513c0/0_0_867_520/500.jpg\" alt=\"An early sketch of Power Stone\u2019s London stage.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An early sketch of Power Stone\u2019s London stage.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Capcom</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Itsuno can reel off features he never got the chance to add, due to the tight development schedule. \u201cThere was a Bomberman-esque mode where the only items on the stage were bombs, and you\u2019d slide them around to hit each other,\u201d he recalls.

People tweet requests to me to make another Power Stone, which I\u2019d love to do if I got the chance. It would be a particularly great fit for the Nintendo Switch.\u201d",

In a sign that falling prices in London are spreading to other regions as the departure date from the EU draws near, the Office for National Statistics said the average cost of a home also fell in the south-east and south-west of England in the year to June. The ONS said it was the first time that average prices had fallen in all three regions of southern England, covering an area extending from Milton Keynes in the north to Lands End in the west and Dover in the east, since September 2009. House price growth across the country has slowed since the Brexit vote three years ago, dragged down by London in particular, where prices fell for the 16th month in succession in June. Average prices across the country rose by 0.9% on the year, the weakest national growth rate since 2012. The average UK house price was \u00a3230,000 in June, about \u00a32,000 higher than a year ago. While property values fell in London and the south, they continue to climb in other areas, albeit at slower rates than in recent years. The biggest rise was in the east Midlands, up 3.2% on the year.

      "body": "<p>As you might surmise from the peachy, fleshy fungi laid out on its cover, <em>The Collection</em> is an ethnography of the penis. It\u2019s a <em>nouveau roman</em>-esque narrative about Jeanne, a woman who has methodical, anonymous sexual encounters in a series of hotel rooms across Paris with men she picks up on the street. She seems in particular to enjoy fellatio, memorising each member she encounters, storing it away in her \u201cmemory palace\u201d. She doesn\u2019t remember anything else about the men, and she doesn\u2019t compare them with one another, simply files away the image to recall when she pleases: \u201cJeanne only has to cross the threshold and she rediscovers the shape, the form, the particular warmth, the density, the smell of the penis; the elasticity of the tissue and its colour when drawn tight and when slackened; the smooth or glistening appearance of the head; the network of bluish blood vessels; the shaded areas; the wrinkled fingerprint skin of the testicles; the growth pattern of the hairs.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s no way around it: the penis is a comic character, the Falstaff of the anatomy. In the original French, the term is <em>sexe</em>, which has an ambiguity of meaning (it can refer to either male or female anatomy) and tonality (the inoffensive \u201ceh\u201d, the pretty sexy x). The word in English is embarrassing, with its cringingly long, whiny first vowel and its truncated last syllable. In translation, the term introduces a jarringly different register from the often lyrical writing around it, here gamely rendered in Laura Francis\u2019s resourceful translation. On the very first page, Leger compares one penis to those \u201cpaper flowers that unfold when placed on water\u201d.

Leger\u2019s rendering of Jeanne\u2019s penile preoccupation is virtuosic and precise while also surprising, even surrealist.

Jeanne has no backstory. We will not learn what she does for a living, or what she looks like; Leger refuses to explain her obsession, and this is a relief.

Of course it\u2019s never meaningless; it\u2019s always a symptom of something not quite right with the heroine. Jeanne looks for herself in novels of nymphomania but finds they always tell the same story: \u201cThe taste for sex itself was not a strength, but the consequence of extreme weakness\u201d; \u201cthe heroines lived only to be the objects of male desire\u201d and they always ended up between the sheets with a man \u201cwhose penis was never described, because it was a symbol, an authority to which the weak woman who had believed herself to be strong surrendered herself, a phallus, not a cock\u201d.</p> <p>The novel\u2019s audacity did not go unremarked when it was published in France in 2017, under the title <em>Mise en Pi\u00e8ces</em>, and went on to win the Prix Ana\u00efs Nin. Leger was invited to take part in a television talk show called <em>On </em><em>N\u2019est Pas </em><em>Couch\u00e9</em>, where the famously irascible writer Yann Moix claimed to detest the book, saying that it was \u201cold-fashioned\u201d, that it wasn\u2019t as shocking as Georges Bataille\u2019s pornographic writings, and that in his view it presented sex as an obscenity. Whether this was a wilful misreading of the novel, or a genuine inability to understand what Leger was up to, it provided a case study in why her book is urgently necessary: because there are still men out there who don\u2019t understand how rare and revolutionary it is for a woman to write about what their penises look like to her.

      "body": "<p>A Eurythmics reunion is high on the wishlist of anyone who loved pop in the 1980s, but despite reconvening for occasional promotional activity, most recently when their albums were reissued last year, the duo have not toured since 1999. That\u2019s not for lack of guitarist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/davestewart\">Dave Stewart</a> wanting to have one more go, but until singer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/annie-lennox\">Annie Lennox</a> agrees, events like this \u2013 staged for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/feb/11/nile-rodgers-announced-as-guest-curator-for-meltdown-festival-2019\">Nile Rodgers\u2019s Meltdown week</a> \u2013 will have to suffice.</p> <p>Fronted by Stewart, Eurythmics Songbook is a freewheeling evening of music, reminiscence and \u2013 given the participation of his offspring Django and Kaya \u2013 family ties. There\u2019s a warm preamble from close friend Rodgers, who recounts his delight at discovering that the 66-year-old Stewart is his elder by 10 days (needless to say, Rodgers will pop up later, accompanied by Chic vocalists Kimberly Davis and Folami, to help out on a couple of songs). Musicians then amble on in twos and threes until no fewer than 34 people, including the London Community Gospel Choir, are jostling for space. (Notably, gender parity is achieved and then some, with women comprising well over half the musicians \u2013 and special mention must go to the remarkable harmonica player <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/SfairIndiara/\">Indiara Sfair</a>.) Stewart, in a three-piece suit and snappy hat, wanders the stage \u2013 not so much ringmaster as roving cast member \u2013 and guest vocalists come and go.</p> <p>\u201cAnnie and I wrote a crazy amount of songs,\u201d he says, and proceeds to play two dozen of them: not just the still-stupendous <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/dec/11/eurythmics-how-we-made-sweet-dreams-are-made-of-this-annie-lennox-dave-stewart-interview\">Sweet Dreams</a>, Thorn in My Side and Who\u2019s That Girl, but deeper cuts like (My My) Baby\u2019s Gonna Cry and When the Day Goes Down. Kaya Stewart blasts the latter with gusto, but the battle of the siblings is won by Django\u2019s aching take on I Need a Man. Meanwhile, West End actor Ryan Molloy gives Thorn in My Side and Love is a Stranger a gratuitously camp musical-theatre garnish that\u2019s all wrong, but somehow feels right in this forgiving context.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dd2fe97fae8273b7333290d25fec8648decfe527\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd2fe97fae8273b7333290d25fec8648decfe527/0_349_3500_1984/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Iris Gold, Nile Rodgers, Dave Stewart and Beverley Knight rock out another hit.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"567\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jostling for space \u2026 Iris Gold, Nile Rodgers, Dave Stewart and Beverley Knight rock out another hit.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Victor Frankowski/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This doing-nothing-by-halves approach is antithetical, perhaps intentionally, to the pristine minimalism of 80s Eurythmics concerts. Over the set\u2019s two hours, in fact, it\u2019s hard to trace any congruent line from the original Eurythmics to tonight\u2019s production. Indeed, the show also makes the point that there\u2019s no real modern equivalent of Lennox and Stewart\u2019s bold, future-facing act, in which ambiguity and painful sexual politics didn\u2019t just flourish inside a brittle synthpop shell, they repeatedly topped the charts.</p> <p>Taken on its own merits, however, the evening stands up. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/jan/14/emeli-sande-q-an-a-interview\">Emeli Sand\u00e9</a> and an invigorating <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/aug/04/beverley-knight-defends-her-casting-as-emmeline-pankhurst\">Beverley Knight</a>, Stewart has picked his star turns well, with Sand\u00e9 especially potent on There Must be an Angel. Her white shirt/black tie outfit pays homage to Lennox\u2019s androgynous look, and echoes the monochromatic video graphics showing Eurythmics as young pop strangelings. The show is studded with many such piquant touches, such as Stewart recollecting the time Bob Dylan, \u201cin a sombrero\u201d, came for dinner and taught him to play harmonica. All told, tonight\u2019s carnival doesn\u2019t scream \u201cEurythmics\u201d, but it\u2019s satisfying in its own right.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A Eurythmics reunion is high on the wishlist of anyone who loved pop in the 1980s, but despite reconvening for occasional promotional activity, most recently when their albums were reissued last year, the duo have not toured since 1999. That\u2019s not for lack of guitarist Dave Stewart wanting to have one more go, but until singer Annie Lennox agrees, events like this \u2013 staged for Nile Rodgers\u2019s Meltdown week \u2013 will have to suffice. Fronted by Stewart, Eurythmics Songbook is a freewheeling evening of music, reminiscence and \u2013 given the participation of his offspring Django and Kaya \u2013 family ties. There\u2019s a warm preamble from close friend Rodgers, who recounts his delight at discovering that the 66-year-old Stewart is his elder by 10 days (needless to say, Rodgers will pop up later, accompanied by Chic vocalists Kimberly Davis and Folami, to help out on a couple of songs). Musicians then amble on in twos and threes until no fewer than 34 people, including the London Community Gospel Choir, are jostling for space. (Notably, gender parity is achieved and then some, with women comprising well over half the musicians \u2013 and special mention must go to the remarkable harmonica player Indiara Sfair.) Stewart, in a three-piece suit and snappy hat, wanders the stage \u2013 not so much ringmaster as roving cast member \u2013 and guest vocalists come and go. \u201cAnnie and I wrote a crazy amount of songs,\u201d he says, and proceeds to play two dozen of them: not just the still-stupendous Sweet Dreams, Thorn in My Side and Who\u2019s That Girl, but deeper cuts like (My My) Baby\u2019s Gonna Cry and When the Day Goes Down. Kaya Stewart blasts the latter with gusto, but the battle of the siblings is won by Django\u2019s aching take on I Need a Man. Meanwhile, West End actor Ryan Molloy gives Thorn in My Side and Love is a Stranger a gratuitously camp musical-theatre garnish that\u2019s all wrong, but somehow feels right in this forgiving context. This doing-nothing-by-halves approach is antithetical, perhaps intentionally, to the pristine minimalism of 80s Eurythmics concerts. Over the set\u2019s two hours, in fact, it\u2019s hard to trace any congruent line from the original Eurythmics to tonight\u2019s production. Indeed, the show also makes the point that there\u2019s no real modern equivalent of Lennox and Stewart\u2019s bold, future-facing act, in which ambiguity and painful sexual politics didn\u2019t just flourish inside a brittle synthpop shell, they repeatedly topped the charts. Taken on its own merits, however, the evening stands up. In Emeli Sand\u00e9 and an invigorating Beverley Knight, Stewart has picked his star turns well, with Sand\u00e9 especially potent on There Must be an Angel. Her white shirt/black tie outfit pays homage to Lennox\u2019s androgynous look, and echoes the monochromatic video graphics showing Eurythmics as young pop strangelings. The show is studded with many such piquant touches, such as Stewart recollecting the time Bob Dylan, \u201cin a sombrero\u201d, came for dinner and taught him to play harmonica. All told, tonight\u2019s carnival doesn\u2019t scream \u201cEurythmics\u201d, but it\u2019s satisfying in its own right.",

There is, however, a new frontier of pornography growing rapidly, one that is already radically changing the industry for the better.

As a self-described lesbian stud, Wayans says people often tried to make her into something she wasn\u2019t. \u201cPeople would ask me to show my breasts more, to look the way I felt the most uncomfortable. I was like: \u2018I\u2019m funny!

      "bodyText": "In 2017, Tiffany Haddish, the breakout star of Girls Trip, told the Guardian that she has never wanted to \u201csteal the show\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m not a thief. Where I come from, you don\u2019t call someone that.\u201d This week, Haddish is going to practise what she preaches, handing the mic over to six comedians she thinks deserve our time. The stars subvert the male, pale and stale status quo: they are mainly women of colour, and also represent queer, trans and working-class identities. The show undoubtedly breaks new ground in representation in comedy. Haddish, who turned her hand to the art of laughter when she went into foster care aged 12, has described her candid style of comedy as a \u201csafe space\u201d to discuss adversity. She lived in her car while trying to land work in her 20s, then shot to fame after giving it her all in Girls Trip. Now, They Ready on Netflix will pass the baton to other comedians who have been sidelined by history. The show also fits into a rapidly changing comedy climate, which is more diverse than it ever has been. In 2011, Shappi Khorsandi joked that she was probably the \u201conly female Iranian comedian\u201d \u2013 but since then, dozens more women of colour have sprung on to the scene and become household names. HBO\u2019s Insecure blew the stage wide open for black women comics in 2016, while women of colour-fronted podcasts such as 2 Dope Queens have become mainstays of the morning commute, and standups such as Ali Wong have seen their shows go stratospheric on Netflix.

That video, which showed Brazil\u2019s World Cup highlights from 1930-86, is the perfect document of a time when <em>jogo bonito</em> was a mantra rather than a slogan. And though we effused about umpteen bits of skill on that tape, nothing captured the visceral brilliance and sheer fantasy of Brazilian football quite like the screamer with the outside of the foot.</p> <p>We\u2019ve mentioned Nelinho <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2010/feb/12/joy-of-six-screamers\">in a previous Joy of Six</a>, so let\u2019s move swiftly on to \u00c9der, the luxury left-winger in that glorious 1982 team. In cricket, those who swing the ball prodigiously are said to make the ball talk. When \u00c9der hit it with the outside of the foot, he made it talk like Brian Blessed. At Wembley in 1981 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHJDUfpmwT0#t=5m43s\">he sent Ray Clemence the wrong way </a><em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHJDUfpmwT0#t=5m43s\">from outside the area</a></em>, while his <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCFL1UEJ47M\">free-kick against Argentina at the 1982 World Cup</a> was so spectacular that he is associated with the goal more than the actual scorer, Zico.</p> <p>That free-kick was revelatory to the rest of the world, but not those familiar with Brazilian domestic football. \u00c9der had been doing it for years. In 1978, he scored a quite ludicrous howitzer for Gr\u00eamio against Internacional. His run-up was so long, the cameraman had to sweep to the right just to get him in shot. As he did so, commentator Celestino Valenzeula, familiar with \u00c9der\u2019s prowess from 40 yards, delivered an urgent public service announcement: \u201cAtenci\u00f3n.\u201d</p> <p>\u00c9der attended to the ball all right. After that endless run-up, he exploded into the shot with both feet off the ground, and the vicious speed and swerve gave the goalkeeper Luis Carlos Gasperin precisely 0.00% chance. A lot of celebrated goals from the distant past look modest to modern eyes. But this \u2013 and most things on the Boys from Brazil VHS \u2013 would look awesome in any era.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozh64N34m38\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ozh64N34m38?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed&start=32\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p><em><strong>See also (Brazil department):</strong></em></p> <ul> <li><p><em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lWZyHLS0EY\">Nelinho</a></em></p></li> <li><p><em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WT_2SkiGhw\">Branco</a> (wait for the replay from behind the goal)</em></p></li> <li><p><em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYf6LdfGnu8\">Branco (II)</a></em></p></li> <li><p><em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9mDPOnJpoU\">Maicon</a></em></p></li> <li><p><em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crKwlbwvr88\">Roberto Carlos</a></em></p></li> </ul> <h2>2) <strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3eVIJ9dAN8&amp;t=1470s\">Juan</a></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3eVIJ9dAN8&amp;t=1470s\"> Sebasti\u00e1n </a><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3eVIJ9dAN8&amp;t=1470s\">Ver\u00f3n, Manchester United 3-2 Deportivo La Coru</a></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3eVIJ9dAN8&amp;t=1470s\">\u00f1</a><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3eVIJ9dAN8&amp;t=1470s\">a, Champions League quarter-final, 10 April 2002</a></strong></h2> <p>Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Ver\u00f3n<em><strong> </strong></em>was the ultimate two-footed player. He was equally comfortable with the inside or the outside of his right foot. Ver\u00f3n\u2019s idea of hell was having to use his left foot in public \u2013 look at the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7HM1RfNfS4#t=3m53s\">his sheer terror</a> here \u2013 but <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4Y09J1j_c4\">99% of the time, that wasn\u2019t a problem</a>.</p> <p>Ver\u00f3n belongs to a select group of players \u2013 Dennis Bergkamp and Ricardo Quaresma are others \u2013 who have greater control and range with the outside of the foot than most do with the inside. That allows them to curl it both ways and find angles that are beyond other players, something especially valuable when it comes to opening up a defence.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/jun/23/the-joy-of-six-diego-maradona\">The Joy of Six: Diego Maradona</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ver\u00f3n was ultimately a failure at Manchester United <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9JoktbTWc4\">but he had his moments</a>, and most were orgasmic through balls. Not unlike Paul Pogba, then. Ver\u00f3n\u2019s best was a devastating pass to set up Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s second goal against Deportivo in 2002. The match is famous for David Beckham <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2002/apr/11/newsstory.sport3\">adding the word metatarsal</a> to the football lexicon. But it\u2019s Ver\u00f3n\u2019s use of the fifth metatarsal that deserves to be remembered.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x4xmno3?start=612s\">The longer video </a><a href=\"https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x4xmno3?start=612s\">shows that Seba treated himself to three preparatory touches</a>, all with the outside of his right foot, before flicking a regal pass that took three defenders out of the game and put Solskjaer through on goal. The ball fizzed along the turf with a trajectory and precision usually seen on the bowling green \u2013 except this was played at defence-splitting speed.</p> <p>The most brilliant thing about it is the late curve. The more you watch it, the more mystifying it gets. Had it started to straighten any earlier, it would have been intercepted by H\u00e9ctor; any later and it would have pushed Solskjaer too wide. A crack team of air-traffic controllers, with the ability to freeze time, could not have plotted a better path to goal. Ver\u00f3n had a couple of seconds to work it all out, while a series of shapes moved in his peripheral vision \u2013 and had to execute it as well.

This is where the World XI comes to Hackney Marshes; where the superior technique required to smack the ball with the outside of the foot is combined with the primal screamer we see at every level.</p> <p>Enzo Scifo didn\u2019t actually score against England at Italia 90, but his spectacular shot that slammed off the inside of the post was one of the tournament\u2019s more eye-widening moments. He scored a superb goal with the outside of his foot against Uruguay earlier in the competition, yet that owed most to precision. The effort against England was hit with thumping force. The technique was immaculate, too, his left arm pointing sideways and his body falling slightly to the left like a broken Subbuteo player as the ball detonated off his right foot.</p> <p>In those days, hardly anyone in the old Barclays League Division 1 dared use the outside of the foot to move the ball two yards, never mind scorch it off the post from 30. The World Cup was a portal to a more exotic place. England won the game \u2013 you might remember David Platt\u2019s goal \u2013 but Scifo captured the imagination.</p> <p><em><strong>See also (screamer department):</strong></em></p> <ul> <li><p><em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiBKAT0zmow\">Michael Essien</a></em></p></li> <li><p><em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1MpJJ4tfLY\">Papiss Cisse</a></em></p></li> <li><p><em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTx9_mm48zU\">Paul Pogba</a></em></p></li> <li><p><em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fj3-KLm11Ec\">Ian Edwards</a></em></p></li> <li><p><em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjiJMDJyw08#t=73m25s\">Brian Laws</a></em></p></li> </ul> <h2>4) <strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avDX5falmns\">Te\u00f3filo</a></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avDX5falmns\"> Cubillas, Peru 3-1 Scotland, World Cup Group 4, 3 June 1978</a></h2> <p>Before Scotland\u2019s first match of the 1978 World Cup, one of the travelling press corps told the goalkeeper Alan Rough to watch out for the free-kicks of Peruvian genius Te\u00f3filo Cubillas. Rough approached his manager, Ally MacLeod, to ask if there was anything in particular he should know. \u201cOch, forget him lad,\u201d said MacLeod. \u201cHe\u2019s nothing special.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/mar/18/world-cup-moments-scotland-1978-rollercoaster\">You probably know what happened next</a>. Cubillas scored two superb goals, the second a free-kick, to give Peru a stunning 3-1 win over a Scotland side who had been among the favourites. MacLeod really did stretch the philosophy of focusing on yourself rather than the opposition to breaking point. In his defence, no amount of preparation was likely to have done Rough or Scotland much good. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGPafD_Ku1k\">Cubillas could use either side of the foot to go to either side of the goal</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8d3795e7214e4f8499c0861f4e4bc29fe077903f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d3795e7214e4f8499c0861f4e4bc29fe077903f/519_438_3697_2218/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Peru\u2019s Te\u00f3filo Cubillas is mobbed by teammates after scoring one of his two goals against Scotland\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Peru\u2019s Te\u00f3filo Cubillas is mobbed by teammates after scoring one of his two goals against Scotland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mirrorpix via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet even by Cubillas\u2019s standards, this was special \u2013 and not just because it was on the grandest stage.

      "bodyText": "NB: The point of the Joy of Six is not to rank things, only to enjoy them 1) \u00c9der, Internacional 2-1 Gr\u00eamio, Campeonato Ga\u00facho, 8 November 1978 When the Joy of Six was growing up, it cherished one VHS more than any other: the Boys from Brazil. That video, which showed Brazil\u2019s World Cup highlights from 1930-86, is the perfect document of a time when jogo bonito was a mantra rather than a slogan. And though we effused about umpteen bits of skill on that tape, nothing captured the visceral brilliance and sheer fantasy of Brazilian football quite like the screamer with the outside of the foot. We\u2019ve mentioned Nelinho in a previous Joy of Six, so let\u2019s move swiftly on to \u00c9der, the luxury left-winger in that glorious 1982 team. In cricket, those who swing the ball prodigiously are said to make the ball talk. When \u00c9der hit it with the outside of the foot, he made it talk like Brian Blessed. At Wembley in 1981 he sent Ray Clemence the wrong way from outside the area, while his free-kick against Argentina at the 1982 World Cup was so spectacular that he is associated with the goal more than the actual scorer, Zico. That free-kick was revelatory to the rest of the world, but not those familiar with Brazilian domestic football. \u00c9der had been doing it for years. In 1978, he scored a quite ludicrous howitzer for Gr\u00eamio against Internacional. His run-up was so long, the cameraman had to sweep to the right just to get him in shot. As he did so, commentator Celestino Valenzeula, familiar with \u00c9der\u2019s prowess from 40 yards, delivered an urgent public service announcement: \u201cAtenci\u00f3n.\u201d \u00c9der attended to the ball all right. After that endless run-up, he exploded into the shot with both feet off the ground, and the vicious speed and swerve gave the goalkeeper Luis Carlos Gasperin precisely 0.00% chance. A lot of celebrated goals from the distant past look modest to modern eyes. But this \u2013 and most things on the Boys from Brazil VHS \u2013 would look awesome in any era.

He was equally comfortable with the inside or the outside of his right foot. Ver\u00f3n\u2019s idea of hell was having to use his left foot in public \u2013 look at the his sheer terror here \u2013 but 99% of the time, that wasn\u2019t a problem. Ver\u00f3n belongs to a select group of players \u2013 Dennis Bergkamp and Ricardo Quaresma are others \u2013 who have greater control and range with the outside of the foot than most do with the inside. That allows them to curl it both ways and find angles that are beyond other players, something especially valuable when it comes to opening up a defence. Ver\u00f3n was ultimately a failure at Manchester United but he had his moments, and most were orgasmic through balls. Not unlike Paul Pogba, then. Ver\u00f3n\u2019s best was a devastating pass to set up Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s second goal against Deportivo in 2002. The match is famous for David Beckham adding the word metatarsal to the football lexicon. But it\u2019s Ver\u00f3n\u2019s use of the fifth metatarsal that deserves to be remembered. The longer video shows that Seba treated himself to three preparatory touches, all with the outside of his right foot, before flicking a regal pass that took three defenders out of the game and put Solskjaer through on goal. The ball fizzed along the turf with a trajectory and precision usually seen on the bowling green \u2013 except this was played at defence-splitting speed. The most brilliant thing about it is the late curve. The more you watch it, the more mystifying it gets. Had it started to straighten any earlier, it would have been intercepted by H\u00e9ctor; any later and it would have pushed Solskjaer too wide. A crack team of air-traffic controllers, with the ability to freeze time, could not have plotted a better path to goal. Ver\u00f3n had a couple of seconds to work it all out, while a series of shapes moved in his peripheral vision \u2013 and had to execute it as well. If you can\u2019t see the greatness in that, youse are all effing idiots.

This is where the World XI comes to Hackney Marshes; where the superior technique required to smack the ball with the outside of the foot is combined with the primal screamer we see at every level. Enzo Scifo didn\u2019t actually score against England at Italia 90, but his spectacular shot that slammed off the inside of the post was one of the tournament\u2019s more eye-widening moments. He scored a superb goal with the outside of his foot against Uruguay earlier in the competition, yet that owed most to precision. The effort against England was hit with thumping force. The technique was immaculate, too, his left arm pointing sideways and his body falling slightly to the left like a broken Subbuteo player as the ball detonated off his right foot. In those days, hardly anyone in the old Barclays League Division 1 dared use the outside of the foot to move the ball two yards, never mind scorch it off the post from 30. The World Cup was a portal to a more exotic place. England won the game \u2013 you might remember David Platt\u2019s goal \u2013 but Scifo captured the imagination.

Rough approached his manager, Ally MacLeod, to ask if there was anything in particular he should know. \u201cOch, forget him lad,\u201d said MacLeod. \u201cHe\u2019s nothing special.\u201d You probably know what happened next. Cubillas scored two superb goals, the second a free-kick, to give Peru a stunning 3-1 win over a Scotland side who had been among the favourites. MacLeod really did stretch the philosophy of focusing on yourself rather than the opposition to breaking point. In his defence, no amount of preparation was likely to have done Rough or Scotland much good. Cubillas could use either side of the foot to go to either side of the goal. Yet even by Cubillas\u2019s standards, this was special \u2013 and not just because it was on the grandest stage. Thousands of free-kicks have been scored with the outside of the foot, and thousands have been placed delicately into the net from 20 yards in the McAllister/Mata style. But we\u2019re struggling to recall many that have combined the two, as Cubillas did with that delicious, insouciant pass into the top corner. Franz Beckenbauer patented a flicked chip with the outside of the foot. Yet Cubillas\u2019s was even better, not least because the free-kick was a fair way left of centre, the wrong side for an outside-of-the-right-footer. It\u2019s a subtly extraordinary piece of skill, one that should have been named after him \u2013 if only anybody was good enough to repeat it.

(In the same game, Dennis Wise became the first man to score with a two-footed tackle on the ball, but we digress.) And then there\u2019s Zidane\u2019s extravagant shank against Bayern Munich. You half expect it to be accompanied by a few sound effects: a clonk here, a parp there. But this is no piece of Soccer AM gold; Zidane intended to bring a touch of the Crucible Theatre to the Olympiastadion. The outside of the foot has always been a useful tool for deception, and by the time the four Bayern defenders in close proximity realised what Zidane was up to, the ball was on its way through to Roberto Carlos. Sir Alex Ferguson once said Zidane \u201cdoes all his fancy tricks without really hurting you\u201d.

      "bodyText": "For a group Thurston Moore once called \u201cthe most important band in America\u201d, Redd Kross have a knack for not helping themselves. Take grunge, of which they were unlikely forefathers. Jonathan Poneman, founder of Sub Pop Records \u2013 the label that kickstarted the grunge scene with Nirvana and Mudhoney \u2013 said their 1987 album Neurotica, which mixed sludgy hard rock and bright choruses, was \u201ca life changer for me and for a lot of people in the Seattle music community\u201d. But by the time grunge broke, they were making music inspired by early 70s AM rock and bubblegum pop, and 1990\u2019s big-budget, major-label album Third Eye died a death. Or consider the late 80s, when one promoter looked at an LA band with long hair who loved Kiss. Surely they would fit right in with hair metal? And so they appeared \u2013 fairly inappropriately \u2013 at the Country Club in Reseda with Poison and Leatherwolf. \u201cWe wore makeup on occasion, but our idea of it was to be like a transvestite hooker in a back alley,\u201d says bassist Steven McDonald. \u201cPoison looked more like the cast of Dynasty \u2013 honey-toasted and frosted, a midwest mall-chick vibe.\u201d \u201cWe were also very bad pranksters at the time,\u201d says his older brother Jeff, singer and guitarist. \u201cA lot of those hair metal bands would leave their phone numbers on their ads. So we would crank call groups like Poison.\u201d \u201cI would say we damaged our career on more than one occasion through the act of crank calling,\u201d Steven says. \u201cWe used to crank call our own record label.\u201d \u201cAs members of Poison,\u201d Jeff adds. \u201cWe would call the label pretending to be members of Poison or Stryper,\u201d Steven continues, \u201creally disgruntled that we were seeing too much of the other band\u2019s activities out there, and complaining they weren\u2019t paying any attention to us.\u201d The McDonalds convinced the label the calls had been made by a friend of theirs \u2013 letters of apology to their victims were demanded. \u201cOur friend said he\u2019d do it,\u201d Jeff says. \u201cOn a tortilla.

This was the decade in which black people were labelled \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/21/hillary-clinton-black-millennial-voters\" title=\"\">super predators</a>\u201d. These racist ideas had been hammered into Kendi\u2019s skull \u2013 and he reproduced them in a speech in front of thousands of predominantly black young people.

He was born in Queens, New York, in Ronald Reagan\u2019s US; his parents met in 1970 at a conference focused on black theology, which he describes as \u201cthe notions that black Christians should use Christianity as a form and source of liberation, that Jesus is black, that God is black, that the Church needs to be relevant to the black community\u201d. They became Christian ministers and instilled in him this fusion of Christian ideas and black power. As a young child, he saw them discussing constantly how to challenge racism and \u201censure that black people could truly be free in the United States\u201d.</p> \n<p>As a student he changed his middle name from Henry to Xolani (Zulu for \u201cbe peaceful\u201d) after learning about the Portuguese explorer Henry the Navigator\u2019s part in the slave trade. Then, on his wedding day, he and his wife changed their surnames to Kendi, which means \u201cthe loved one\u201d in the Kenyan language of Meru, <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/08/19/the-fight-to-redefine-racism\" title=\"\">according to the New Yorker</a>.<strong> </strong>A former journalism student, his PhD dissertation looked at the black radical student movements of the 60s; in 2016, he won the National Book award for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/aug/24/stamped-from-beginning-ibram-x-kendi-review\" title=\"\">Stamped </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/aug/24/stamped-from-beginning-ibram-x-kendi-review\" title=\"\">from </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/aug/24/stamped-from-beginning-ibram-x-kendi-review\" title=\"\">the Beginning</a>, which aimed to tell \u201cthe definitive history of racist ideas in America\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"73daf0ff4661f423c8bd860281bdcced379ff148\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/73daf0ff4661f423c8bd860281bdcced379ff148/37_40_2979_1973/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bill Clinton, then the US president, watches a student police officer at shooting practice\" width=\"1000\" height=\"662\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018His crime bill led to the greatest mass incarceration of black and brown people in American history\u2019 ...

At its core is a superficially simple idea that, somehow, when you read it, feels like a light switch being flicked on: that any genuine opponent of racism has to identify as an anti-racist, not simply as \u201cnot racist\u201d. In fact, Kendi believes US history can be seen as a battle between anti-racist and racist ideas.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think most people across the world are taught to believe \u2013 and believe themselves \u2013 to be not racist,\u201d he explains. Even obvious racists often do not self-identify as such, he notes, from slaveowners to colonisers to 21st-century white nationalists. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2019/jul/30/trump-claims-least-racist-person-in-the-world\" title=\"\">I am the least racist person there is anywhere in the world</a>,\u201d the racist US president declared in July. \u201cI don\u2019t think people realise that when they self-identify as \u2018not racist\u2019, they\u2019re essentially identifying in the same way as white supremacists,\u201d says Kendi.</p> \n<p>Proclaiming that you are<strong> </strong>\u201cnot racist\u201d does not require anyone to consider how they should fight racism. To be anti-racist, on the other hand, means developing a philosophy that directly confronts that of a racist.</p> \n<p>Racists hold that \u201ccertain racial groups are better or worse than others\u201d, Kendi says, while an anti-racist \u201cexpresses emotions that the racial groups are equals\u201d. There is no middle ground, he says. We either support systems and policies that promote racial inequality \u2013 with enthusiasm, or by our own passivity \u2013 or we actively fight them. \u201cSo, the term \u2018not racist\u2019 not only has no meaning, but it also connotes that there is this sort of in-between safe space sideline that a person can be on, when there is no neutrality,\u201d he explains. \u201cWe\u2019re either all being racist or anti-racist.\u201d This is why he wrote this book: he couldn\u2019t define \u201cnot racism\u201d and wanted to answer those who asked: \u201cHow do I be anti-racist?\u201d </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>The mainstream media have been one of the historic platforms for racist ideas</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>What does this mean in practice? For one, reparations for centuries of oppression and systemic injustice against black people has become a mainstream demand of anti-racist movements in the US. It has been caricatured as writing a cheque to African-American citizens, but, <a href=\"https://policy.m4bl.org/reparations/\" title=\"\">in a 2016 manifesto</a>, an umbrella group called the Movement for Black Lives detailed what it could mean: universal access to education for all black people; a guaranteed liveable income; a national curriculum that centres on the legacy of colonialism and slavery; and access and control of food, housing and land. \u201cWhite median wealth in the United States is about 10 times more than black median wealth, so there\u2019s a massive racial wealth gap,\u201d he says \u2013 and it is growing. How is it possible, Kendi asks, to reduce \u2013 let alone eliminate \u2013 such a gap without reparations? This would be anti-racism in action.</p> \n<p>What of the media\u2019s role in legitimising racist ideas and making them mainstream? From Fox News to Britain\u2019s rightwing media, Muslims, migrants and refugees face demonisation and hate. He pauses, smiling gently, choosing his words carefully. \u201cFirst, the mainstream media should recognise that they have been one of the historic platforms for racist ideas,\u201d he says. \u201cThe mainstream media have historically reproduced racist ideas, often not knowing it.\u201d</p> \n<p>Then there is the issue of how the far right have attempted to protect hate speech \u2013 specifically the right to use public platforms to incite hatred \u2013 as \u201cfree speech\u201d. Kendi says it is worse than that: just as the second amendment grants Americans the right to possess guns that are then used to kill their fellow citizens, so the first amendment \u2013 intended to protect free speech \u2013 can safeguard the right to incite racism. \u201cWhen you put them together, you have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/04/mass-shootings-el-paso-texas-dayton-ohio\" title=\"\">mass murder as happened </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/04/mass-shootings-el-paso-texas-dayton-ohio\" title=\"\">in El Paso</a>.\u201d Kendi refers to the classic debunking of unimpeded speech: yelling \u201cFire!\u201d in a crowded theatre and causing a fatal stampede. In the face of El Paso, Christchurch, Pittsburgh and Ut\u00f8ya, what counter-argument is there?</p> \n<p>One of the misconceptions about Trump is that his victory fell out of a clear blue sky \u2013 that state-sanctioned racism is a new phenomenon. Yet it is no accident, Kendi argues, that the Trump era followed the election of the first African-American president: in the Reconstruction era that followed the US civil war, \u201cRadical Republicans\u201d fought passionately for the equality of the formerly enslaved. Then came segregation and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/10/history-of-lynchings-and-racial-violence-continues-to-haunt-us\" title=\"\">the Jim Crow laws</a>, the Ku Klux Klan, lynching and racist oppression. The idea of a \u201cpost-racial society\u201d, he believes, merely perpetuates the myth that inequities aren\u2019t caused by racist policies \u2013 \u201cbecause we are post-racial, we no longer have a race problem\u201d.</p> \n<p>History is not a story of relentless progress, after all, but of victories followed by setbacks and defeats. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely critical for us to call out Trump\u2019s racism, but we should simultaneously recognise that it is reflective and representative of the history of America and that, if we get rid of Trump, we\u2019re not getting rid of racism,\u201d says Kendi.</p> \n<p>Trump has recognised the pervasiveness of anti-black, anti-Muslim and anti-Latinx racism and built a campaign around it. But what of George W Bush \u2013 who partly owed his presidency to the disenfranchisement of Florida\u2019s black citizens \u2013 and what of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/28/bush-new-orleans-10-years-after-katrina\" title=\"\">his response to Hurricane Katrina</a>?

What of Reagan, who vetoed sanctions against Apartheid South Africa and used racialised dog whistles such as \u201cwelfare queens\u201d, widely seen as feckless, undeserving African-Americans?</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1a38c1231a2e7ee2fbb5118df78b4db15dd572a4\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1a38c1231a2e7ee2fbb5118df78b4db15dd572a4/0_0_5854_3903/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Congresswomen Rashida Tlaib, Ilhan Omar, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and Ayanna Pressley speak last month about Donald Trump\u2019s Twitter attacks on them\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Squad ... congresswomen Rashida Tlaib, Ilhan Omar, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and Ayanna Pressley speak last month about Donald Trump\u2019s Twitter attacks on them.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Lo Scalzo/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>What is particularly striking about Kendi\u2019s ideas is how racism and neo-liberalism \u2013 which justifies driving back the public realm in favour of the market, deregulation and slashing taxes on the rich \u2013 has fused. After the second world war, the consensus in the west was that society was riddled with collective injustices that could be fixed only with collective solutions. That drove the foundation of the welfare state and the NHS in Britain; in the US, it underpinned the \u201cGreat Society\u201d and \u201cWar on Poverty\u201d of Lyndon Johnson. Then Thatcherism and Reaganism argued that problems such as unemployment or poverty were a question of character and personal, moral failings. \u201cThis was a revolution against the idea that the cause of economic and even racial inequities was policies,\u201d Kendi says. \u201cTherefore, these new revolutionaries made the case that the problem was not policies \u2013 the problem was people.\u201d It was a convenient means to rationalise growing inequality \u2013 those at the top deserved to be there, as did those at the bottom. \u201cThe problems were these inferior racial groups \u2013 although they didn\u2019t use the term \u2018inferior\u2019; they just used dog whistles.\u201d</p> \n<p>This lies partly at the root of \u201cwhitelash\u201d against the struggles of minorities for equality. As the phrase goes: \u201cWhen you are accustomed to privilege, equality feels like oppression.\u201d As Kendi puts it: \u201cYou already believe equality of opportunity exists, so instead you\u2019re going to reframe equal opportunity as an assault against you and your livelihood.\u201d</p> \n<p>It was convenient too, to deflect responsibility from injustices caused by the powerful. When people blame immigrants, Muslims, or black people \u201cas the cause of their own economic and social struggles\u201d, as Kendi puts it, the politicians who have caused injustice are no longer held to account. It also entrenches divisions within the working class \u2013 \u201cThe working class in the United States has never been united; it\u2019s always been divided along the lines of race\u201d \u2013 breaking down the solidarity needed to progress. Kendi is clear, too, that the histories of racism and capitalism can\u2019t be separated. \u201cRacism and capitalism emerged at the same time, in 15th-century western Europe, and they\u2019ve reinforced each other from the beginning.\u201d Slavery and colonialism accumulated the wealth that powered capitalist expansionism. For Kendi, to be an anti-racist is also to be an anti-capitalist.</p> \n<p>For all this, Kendi sees hope. In the rise of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/17/the-squad-name-origins-aoc-ilhan-omar-ayanna-pressley-rashida-tlaib\" title=\"\">the Squad</a> \u2013 the freshman progressive congresswomen of colour Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib, Ayanna Pressley and Ilhan Omar \u2013 for instance. Trump has engaged in racist onslaughts against them, imploring the women \u2013 three of whom were born in the US and all of whom are citizens \u2013 to \u201cgo back [to] the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came\u201d, while his supporters chanted \u201cSend her back\u201d when he lambasted Omar. The Squad epitomises something particularly threatening, says Kendi \u2013 not just for Trumpian Republicans, but many moderate and liberal Democrats, too. \u201cThey represent this young, anti-racist movement among people of colour, to challenge and reshape America,\u201d he says. Yet they are hated for being \u201ctoo young, or too radical, or too dark.

Kendi is in no doubt: racism propelled Trump to victory and anti-racism will defeat him.

      "bodyText": "It is a moment that disturbs Ibram X Kendi to this day. It was the 90s, and Kendi \u2013 then in his final year of high school \u2013 was due to deliver a speech at a public-speaking contest held in Martin Luther King\u2019s honour. \u201cWhen we think of American history in the 90s, we\u2019re really talking about the period in which people in both political parties, people of all races were looking at the increasing violent crimes among black youth, particularly in urban neighbourhoods, as fundamentally caused by a problem with the black youth; the growing percentage of single-parent households,\u201d he says, setting the scene. \u201cWe had people thinking that the cause of that was that there was something wrong with young, black mothers.\u201d Both white and black people thought there was something wrong with black youth: they didn\u2019t value education enough; they were focused on having sex and getting pregnant; they were \u201cnot being trained well by their parents\u201d. This was the decade in which black people were labelled \u201csuper predators\u201d. These racist ideas had been hammered into Kendi\u2019s skull \u2013 and he reproduced them in a speech in front of thousands of predominantly black young people. And they cheered him for it. \u201cOn a day that was supposed to be celebrating black youth \u2013 we were a representation about all the things right about black youth \u2013 all I could think about was all of the things wrong with black youth. I swallowed those racist ideas whole, because they were largely fed to me by older people,\u201d he says. A softly spoken giant with tied\u2011back dreadlocks, wearing a suit complete with a pocket handkerchief, Kendi is a highly charismatic historian and author who is emerging as one of the pre-eminent intellectuals on race. He was born in Queens, New York, in Ronald Reagan\u2019s US; his parents met in 1970 at a conference focused on black theology, which he describes as \u201cthe notions that black Christians should use Christianity as a form and source of liberation, that Jesus is black, that God is black, that the Church needs to be relevant to the black community\u201d. They became Christian ministers and instilled in him this fusion of Christian ideas and black power. As a young child, he saw them discussing constantly how to challenge racism and \u201censure that black people could truly be free in the United States\u201d. As a student he changed his middle name from Henry to Xolani (Zulu for \u201cbe peaceful\u201d) after learning about the Portuguese explorer Henry the Navigator\u2019s part in the slave trade. Then, on his wedding day, he and his wife changed their surnames to Kendi, which means \u201cthe loved one\u201d in the Kenyan language of Meru, according to the New Yorker. A former journalism student, his PhD dissertation looked at the black radical student movements of the 60s; in 2016, he won the National Book award for Stamped from the Beginning, which aimed to tell \u201cthe definitive history of racist ideas in America\u201d. In the age of Donald Trump and rightwing populism, his new book, How to Be an Antiracist could hardly be more relevant. At its core is a superficially simple idea that, somehow, when you read it, feels like a light switch being flicked on: that any genuine opponent of racism has to identify as an anti-racist, not simply as \u201cnot racist\u201d. In fact, Kendi believes US history can be seen as a battle between anti-racist and racist ideas. \u201cI think most people across the world are taught to believe \u2013 and believe themselves \u2013 to be not racist,\u201d he explains. Even obvious racists often do not self-identify as such, he notes, from slaveowners to colonisers to 21st-century white nationalists. \u201cI am the least racist person there is anywhere in the world,\u201d the racist US president declared in July. \u201cI don\u2019t think people realise that when they self-identify as \u2018not racist\u2019, they\u2019re essentially identifying in the same way as white supremacists,\u201d says Kendi. Proclaiming that you are \u201cnot racist\u201d does not require anyone to consider how they should fight racism. To be anti-racist, on the other hand, means developing a philosophy that directly confronts that of a racist. Racists hold that \u201ccertain racial groups are better or worse than others\u201d, Kendi says, while an anti-racist \u201cexpresses emotions that the racial groups are equals\u201d. There is no middle ground, he says. We either support systems and policies that promote racial inequality \u2013 with enthusiasm, or by our own passivity \u2013 or we actively fight them. \u201cSo, the term \u2018not racist\u2019 not only has no meaning, but it also connotes that there is this sort of in-between safe space sideline that a person can be on, when there is no neutrality,\u201d he explains. \u201cWe\u2019re either all being racist or anti-racist.\u201d This is why he wrote this book: he couldn\u2019t define \u201cnot racism\u201d and wanted to answer those who asked: \u201cHow do I be anti-racist?\u201d What does this mean in practice? For one, reparations for centuries of oppression and systemic injustice against black people has become a mainstream demand of anti-racist movements in the US. It has been caricatured as writing a cheque to African-American citizens, but, in a 2016 manifesto, an umbrella group called the Movement for Black Lives detailed what it could mean: universal access to education for all black people; a guaranteed liveable income; a national curriculum that centres on the legacy of colonialism and slavery; and access and control of food, housing and land. \u201cWhite median wealth in the United States is about 10 times more than black median wealth, so there\u2019s a massive racial wealth gap,\u201d he says \u2013 and it is growing. How is it possible, Kendi asks, to reduce \u2013 let alone eliminate \u2013 such a gap without reparations? This would be anti-racism in action. What of the media\u2019s role in legitimising racist ideas and making them mainstream? From Fox News to Britain\u2019s rightwing media, Muslims, migrants and refugees face demonisation and hate. He pauses, smiling gently, choosing his words carefully. \u201cFirst, the mainstream media should recognise that they have been one of the historic platforms for racist ideas,\u201d he says. \u201cThe mainstream media have historically reproduced racist ideas, often not knowing it.\u201d Then there is the issue of how the far right have attempted to protect hate speech \u2013 specifically the right to use public platforms to incite hatred \u2013 as \u201cfree speech\u201d. Kendi says it is worse than that: just as the second amendment grants Americans the right to possess guns that are then used to kill their fellow citizens, so the first amendment \u2013 intended to protect free speech \u2013 can safeguard the right to incite racism. \u201cWhen you put them together, you have mass murder as happened in El Paso.\u201d Kendi refers to the classic debunking of unimpeded speech: yelling \u201cFire!\u201d in a crowded theatre and causing a fatal stampede. In the face of El Paso, Christchurch, Pittsburgh and Ut\u00f8ya, what counter-argument is there? One of the misconceptions about Trump is that his victory fell out of a clear blue sky \u2013 that state-sanctioned racism is a new phenomenon. Yet it is no accident, Kendi argues, that the Trump era followed the election of the first African-American president: in the Reconstruction era that followed the US civil war, \u201cRadical Republicans\u201d fought passionately for the equality of the formerly enslaved. Then came segregation and the Jim Crow laws, the Ku Klux Klan, lynching and racist oppression. The idea of a \u201cpost-racial society\u201d, he believes, merely perpetuates the myth that inequities aren\u2019t caused by racist policies \u2013 \u201cbecause we are post-racial, we no longer have a race problem\u201d. History is not a story of relentless progress, after all, but of victories followed by setbacks and defeats. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely critical for us to call out Trump\u2019s racism, but we should simultaneously recognise that it is reflective and representative of the history of America and that, if we get rid of Trump, we\u2019re not getting rid of racism,\u201d says Kendi. Trump has recognised the pervasiveness of anti-black, anti-Muslim and anti-Latinx racism and built a campaign around it. But what of George W Bush \u2013 who partly owed his presidency to the disenfranchisement of Florida\u2019s black citizens \u2013 and what of his response to Hurricane Katrina? What of Bill Clinton\u2019s 1994 crime bill, which led to \u201cthe greatest mass incarceration of black and brown people in American history\u201d, or his \u201cwelfare reform\u201d, which disproportionately penalised minorities? What of Reagan, who vetoed sanctions against Apartheid South Africa and used racialised dog whistles such as \u201cwelfare queens\u201d, widely seen as feckless, undeserving African-Americans? What is particularly striking about Kendi\u2019s ideas is how racism and neo-liberalism \u2013 which justifies driving back the public realm in favour of the market, deregulation and slashing taxes on the rich \u2013 has fused. After the second world war, the consensus in the west was that society was riddled with collective injustices that could be fixed only with collective solutions. That drove the foundation of the welfare state and the NHS in Britain; in the US, it underpinned the \u201cGreat Society\u201d and \u201cWar on Poverty\u201d of Lyndon Johnson. Then Thatcherism and Reaganism argued that problems such as unemployment or poverty were a question of character and personal, moral failings. \u201cThis was a revolution against the idea that the cause of economic and even racial inequities was policies,\u201d Kendi says. \u201cTherefore, these new revolutionaries made the case that the problem was not policies \u2013 the problem was people.\u201d It was a convenient means to rationalise growing inequality \u2013 those at the top deserved to be there, as did those at the bottom. \u201cThe problems were these inferior racial groups \u2013 although they didn\u2019t use the term \u2018inferior\u2019; they just used dog whistles.\u201d This lies partly at the root of \u201cwhitelash\u201d against the struggles of minorities for equality.

Kendi is clear, too, that the histories of racism and capitalism can\u2019t be separated. \u201cRacism and capitalism emerged at the same time, in 15th-century western Europe, and they\u2019ve reinforced each other from the beginning.\u201d Slavery and colonialism accumulated the wealth that powered capitalist expansionism. For Kendi, to be an anti-racist is also to be an anti-capitalist. For all this, Kendi sees hope. In the rise of the Squad \u2013 the freshman progressive congresswomen of colour Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib, Ayanna Pressley and Ilhan Omar \u2013 for instance. Trump has engaged in racist onslaughts against them, imploring the women \u2013 three of whom were born in the US and all of whom are citizens \u2013 to \u201cgo back [to] the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came\u201d, while his supporters chanted \u201cSend her back\u201d when he lambasted Omar.

Adam W starts us off with some linear, perfectly sensible thinking. \u201cBy my calculations, assuming they reach the finals of all three cup competitions they are in and need replays where possible in the FA Cup, Wolves could play 74 games this season (38 PL, eight FA Cup, six League Cup, 22 Europa League).\u201d Some lateral thinking from Andy Brook. \u201cI think a League One team can play 78 matches if they reach the finals of the play-offs, FA Cup (with replays in every round), League Cup and Football League Trophy, \u201c he says. \u201cThey would start all cup competitions in the first round, of course. Although thinking further, that team could have theoretically won the FA Cup the previous season. In which case, they\u2019d have the Community Shield and a bunch of Europa League matches too.\u201d Original asker @jamesv_t goes yet further into the unknown and almost certainly impossible. \u201cIf a League One team had won the FA Cup two years previously, and the Europa League/FA Cup last season, could they not have Champions League football too? Maybe dropping down to Europa League after the group stage?\u201d Finally, Brook returns to break it all down for us: \u201cSeason one: wins Champions League but relegated to Championship. Season two: retains Champions League, wins FA Cup but relegated to League One. Season three: competes in League One and makes playoffs, FA Cup, League Cup, EFL Trophy, Champions League, Community Shield, Super Cup and World Club Cup! \u201cWorking it out: Football League regular-season matches 46, playoffs three, FA Cup 12, League Cup six (I assume they\u2019d start in the third round due to European competitions), EFL Trophy eight. Champions League group six. They finish third and enter the Europa League to play nine further games.

      "body": "<p>In 2019, books are not just a last resort when the wifi is down. There are <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/perpetualpages/\">Instagram</a> accounts, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/series/books\">podcasts</a> and even <a href=\"https://www.thewilloughbybookclub.co.uk/all-book-subscription-gifts-21-c.asp\">subscription boxes</a> dedicated to reading. Chances are you\u2019ve noticed your friends joining <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/poppylovesbookclub\">book clubs</a> or posting beautifully lit bookstagram photos. Reading is \u2013 if it ever was \u2013 cool again.</p> <p>Why? Perhaps for the same reason we\u2019ve seen a surge in interest in hobbies such as <a href=\"https://www.oliverbonas.com/gift/digital-detox-in-a-box-mini-puzzle\">jigsaws</a> and <a href=\"https://www.urbanoutfitters.com/en-gb/shop/feminist-cross-stitch-by-stephanie-rohr\">cross-stitch</a>: right now, our brains are saturated with digital information so it\u2019s no surprise that we\u2019re returning to unplugged hobbies. (But also going online to talk about them.)</p> <p>Being overwhelmed by information has shattered a lot of our attention. As a child with undiagnosed ADHD, I read voraciously because my brain needed constant stimulation and I didn\u2019t yet have a phone to distract me. But as the internet became part of my life, reading lost ground and in my early 20s, I went a year without reading a book at all. But by making a conscious effort to read \u2013 partly, I confess, because of recommendations on Instagram \u2013 I\u2019m back up to at least one book a week.</p> <p>It hasn\u2019t been easy. I\u2019m still busy, I still have ADHD and I still have myriad distractions. But here is what I\u2019ve learned, and what might help you to fall back in love with reading in a way that fits in with our ever-online world.</p> <p><strong>1. Follow book accounts on social media<br></strong>If you\u2019ve been away from reading for a while, it can be hard to know where to start. It can also be really tough to go from living your life online to building a separate one. By following Instagram accounts that regularly post about books, you\u2019ll get ideas: try <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bookofthemonth/\">Book of the Month</a>, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/booksonthesubway/\">Books on the Subway</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/strandbookstore/\">Strand Bookstore</a> for beautifully shot recommendations. </p> <p><strong>2. Read what you want to<br></strong>If you haven\u2019t read in a while, it can be tempting to set yourself lofty goals. For many of us that\u2019s unrealistic, so instead: are there particular topics you\u2019d love to read a non-fiction book about? Is there an author you\u2019ve found easy to read before who has other books? Is there a favourite you can reread? When I\u2019m finding it tough, I often punish myself by trying to slog through something hard before I let myself enjoy something that\u2019s 200 pages and a laugh. But it\u2019s enjoying the 200-pager that gets me in the swing of things, and makes it easier to concentrate on something tougher.</p> <p><strong>3. Join a library<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/dec/22/libraries-dying-books-internet\">Libraries are dying</a>, and it\u2019s partly because a lot of people don\u2019t seem to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/michellecyca/status/1138314416259076098?lang=en\">consider them an option</a>. But if finances are holding you back and you can trek to a library, it\u2019s worth it. You can get recommendations, read for free and give up on books you can\u2019t get into. Many have book clubs, too. For readers in the UK, you can <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/local-library-services\">find your nearest library here</a>.</p> <p><strong>4. Make a TBR (to be read) list<br></strong>Having a realistic to-do list can be a great motivator. You can easily put one together on <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/\">Goodreads</a>, where you record what you\u2019ve read, want to read and have read. You can also add friends, which introduces a competitive element and holds you accountable. </p> <p><strong>5. Try audiobooks<br></strong>If you really can\u2019t concentrate on reading \u2013 or set the time aside \u2013 maybe it\u2019s a good idea to try a service such as Audible. Sure, people can be snobs about audiobooks, but they shouldn\u2019t be. You still get the exact same information, and can participate in all the chats about the biggest book of the summer \u2013 but you can get it done while cooking dinner or out walking.</p> <p><strong>6. Can\u2019t escape your phone? Put books on it<br></strong>Between work, friends and everything else, it can be hard to imagine finding time every day to read. The chances are, though, that you could. Do you commute? If you\u2019re not forced to work on it, you can read. Lunch break? Read! I\u2019m guilty of flicking between social media accounts whenever I get a spare five minutes. But it is just as easy for me to open the Kindle app on my phone as Twitter. Reading ebooks can be more expensive than secondhand books \u2013 but reading on my phone is often the only way I can commit.</p> <p>\u2022 Do you have any tips on overcoming distractions or finding your love of reading again? Leave them in the comments.</p>",

Perhaps for the same reason we\u2019ve seen a surge in interest in hobbies such as jigsaws and cross-stitch: right now, our brains are saturated with digital information so it\u2019s no surprise that we\u2019re returning to unplugged hobbies. (But also going online to talk about them.) Being overwhelmed by information has shattered a lot of our attention. As a child with undiagnosed ADHD, I read voraciously because my brain needed constant stimulation and I didn\u2019t yet have a phone to distract me. But as the internet became part of my life, reading lost ground and in my early 20s, I went a year without reading a book at all. But by making a conscious effort to read \u2013 partly, I confess, because of recommendations on Instagram \u2013 I\u2019m back up to at least one book a week. It hasn\u2019t been easy. I\u2019m still busy, I still have ADHD and I still have myriad distractions. But here is what I\u2019ve learned, and what might help you to fall back in love with reading in a way that fits in with our ever-online world. 1. Follow book accounts on social media If you\u2019ve been away from reading for a while, it can be hard to know where to start. It can also be really tough to go from living your life online to building a separate one. By following Instagram accounts that regularly post about books, you\u2019ll get ideas: try Book of the Month, Books on the Subway and Strand Bookstore for beautifully shot recommendations. 2. Read what you want to If you haven\u2019t read in a while, it can be tempting to set yourself lofty goals. For many of us that\u2019s unrealistic, so instead: are there particular topics you\u2019d love to read a non-fiction book about? Is there an author you\u2019ve found easy to read before who has other books? Is there a favourite you can reread? When I\u2019m finding it tough, I often punish myself by trying to slog through something hard before I let myself enjoy something that\u2019s 200 pages and a laugh. But it\u2019s enjoying the 200-pager that gets me in the swing of things, and makes it easier to concentrate on something tougher. 3. Join a library Libraries are dying, and it\u2019s partly because a lot of people don\u2019t seem to consider them an option. But if finances are holding you back and you can trek to a library, it\u2019s worth it. You can get recommendations, read for free and give up on books you can\u2019t get into. Many have book clubs, too. For readers in the UK, you can find your nearest library here. 4. Make a TBR (to be read) list Having a realistic to-do list can be a great motivator. You can easily put one together on Goodreads, where you record what you\u2019ve read, want to read and have read. You can also add friends, which introduces a competitive element and holds you accountable. 5. Try audiobooks If you really can\u2019t concentrate on reading \u2013 or set the time aside \u2013 maybe it\u2019s a good idea to try a service such as Audible. Sure, people can be snobs about audiobooks, but they shouldn\u2019t be. You still get the exact same information, and can participate in all the chats about the biggest book of the summer \u2013 but you can get it done while cooking dinner or out walking. 6. Can\u2019t escape your phone? Put books on it Between work, friends and everything else, it can be hard to imagine finding time every day to read. The chances are, though, that you could. Do you commute? If you\u2019re not forced to work on it, you can read. Lunch break? Read! I\u2019m guilty of flicking between social media accounts whenever I get a spare five minutes. But it is just as easy for me to open the Kindle app on my phone as Twitter. Reading ebooks can be more expensive than secondhand books \u2013 but reading on my phone is often the only way I can commit. \u2022 Do you have any tips on overcoming distractions or finding your love of reading again?

Of course jeans can work from day to night, but it\u2019s the cut and how the style makes you feel that matters \u2013 it\u2019s not about the exact fit. I have a favourite pair of straight boyfriend jeans which I wear at weekends to fanny about at the local farmers\u2019 market while carrying a straw basket. They are cut in the perfect Jennifer-Aniston-early-noughties denim and I feel really cool in them. But that\u2019s on a Sunday \u2026 at the farmers\u2019 market. If I were wearing them in an elegant restaurant, I would feel rubbish. It is often purely psychological. For me personally, the best day-to-night jean combos have a touch of polish. I\u2019d wear a vintage fit high-waisted jean with a silk vest and blazer, for example. Or a top that showcases the clavicle \u2013 either Bardot style or racer cut \u2013 and add a belt to define the waist.</p> <p>One of the most important factors in day-to-night success is your footwear choice. While no one wants to be tottering around in 120mm pumps for brunch, if you feel \u2013 as I do \u2013 that you need a little lift for night-time confidence, stepping out in sneakers may be an error. My number one choice is a simple two-strap 1.5-inch block heel.

If your hair has a tendency to go frizzy or limp through the day, don\u2019t ever be without a few kirby grips and elastic bands, or bring along a barette or clip to up the ante.

      "bodyText": "A man who allegedly killed a woman in Sydney\u2019s central business district before attacking others on a busy city street is expected to be charged with murder on Wednesday. Officers have been searching Mert Ney\u2019s family home in Marayong in Sydney\u2019s west after Tuesday\u2019s violent rampage, as well as another address at Blacktown. The 20-year-old, who has spent the night under police guard in hospital, had a history of mental health issues. Overnight he underwent surgery for a cut to his knee. \u201cIt is unclear when he will be deemed medically fit to speak with investigators,\u201d New South Wales police said on Wednesday. On Wednesday office workers who were confronted by Ney during his six-minute rampage through the city returned to the scene, many appearing emotional. \u201cLooking back on it now this was a guy who had just killed somebody,\u201d witness Vee Morgana told reporters. \u201cI saw the guy stab someone and I didn\u2019t know how many people he\u2019d stabbed [before that]. \u201cThere was a moment just here on Clarence [Street] it was just me and him just 10 metres apart. I only had my phone on me and there was a moment where I just froze and luckily a [fire fighter] with a crow bar and a guy with a chair came either side of me and they spooked him a little bit.\u201d On Wednesday police revealed the woman allegedly killed by Ney was Michaela Dunn, a 24-year-old from Sydney\u2019s west. Dunn had been working as a sex worker from her Clarence Street apartment, and police said their initial inquiries indicated Ney had attended the unit for an appointment at about 1.30pm. He was captured on CCTV leaving the building at about 1.50pm. The footage, obtained by Channel 7, shows Ney taking a photo of himself as he left the Clarence Street building. Earlier on Wednesday the police commissioner, Mick Fuller, said Ney was expected to be charged with murder as well as serious assault. Police have formed Strike Force Lalchere in response to the stabbings. \u201cIf we can link him to terrorist activity, then the offences that follow would see him locked behind bars for a very, very long time,\u201d Fuller said. Ney\u2019s family had reported him missing and had concerns for his welfare following a domestic violence incident. \u201cThat is not unusual in terms of what we see day-in-day-out in some houses across NSW (but) that is not a common theme for someone to then take the next step of coming onto the streets of Sydney with a knife and killing people and threatening to kill people,\u201d Fuller said. The 20-year-old jumped on cars and yelled at bystanders to \u201cshoot me in the fucking head\u201d before being restrained by members of the public \u2013 later lauded as \u201cheroes\u201d by police \u2013 who used cafe chairs and a milk crate to pin him down. About an hour after the man\u2019s arrest, the body of a 24-year-old woman with a laceration on her neck was found inside an apartment in Clarence Street, in central Sydney. Fuller said Ney had been at the apartment for \u201cbusiness purposes\u201d. A 41-year-old woman was stabbed in the Hotel CBD, on the corner of Clarence and York streets. She was taken to St Vincent\u2019s hospital suffering a non-life threatening injury from a single stab wound to her back. Police say Ney did not have any known links to terrorist groups, and that he had acted alone. The attacks are not being treated as a terrorist attack, Fuller said. The 20-year-old did, however, have \u201csome ideologies in relation to terrorism\u201d and the joint counter-terrorism team would examine if the terrorism threat needs to be reassessed. \u201cThere was certainly information found on him about other crimes of mass casualties and mass deaths around the world,\u201d Fuller said, adding that the material had been discovered on a USB drive. \u2022 Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Video footage shows Ney, who was armed with a large butcher\u2019s knife, yelling \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d while wandering the CBD. He also yelled at bystanders, \u201cShoot me, fucking shoot me in the fucking head, shoot me, I want to fucking die.\u201d The Daily Telegraph reports that he faced a magistrates court in June after being found with knuckledusters. He pleaded guilty to possessing a prohibited weapon and was sentenced to a conditional release order for nine months. Superintendent Gavin Wood said the bystanders who had apprehended the man were \u201csignificantly brave people\u201d. \u201cTo approach a person with a mindset of obviously what this person [had], with clear evidence of a stabbing previously, these people are heroes.\u201d He said their actions had prevented others from being hurt. \u201cThese members of the public, going about their day-to-day business, have jumped into a situation which was extremely dangerous and hostile and they have brought a person, who we will be alleging has stabbed an innocent person for no specific reason, into custody and allowed us to do our job.\u201d Scott Morrison characterised the attack as deeply concerning and said his thoughts were with those affected by the incident. \u201cThe attacker is now in police custody following the brave actions of those who were present at the scene and were able to restrain him,\u201d the prime minister said on Twitter. Police minister David Elliott said he will make sure police consider any exposure Ney had to government services in the recent months as part of their investigation. \u201cWe want to make sure that we learn any lessons that need to be learnt from this particular occasion,\u201d he told reporters.

The latest rise, set by the July retail price index figure published by the Office for National Statistics on Wednesday morning, will add more than \u00a3100 to many annual season tickets, and comes amid warnings that passengers were being priced off the railway. Labour said the average commuter would now be paying more than \u00a33,000 for their season ticket, 40% more than in 2010. The overall cost of train travel has gone up by 46% since 2009, while wages have only grown by 23%, according to TUC analysis of ONS figures.

I was brought up a Hearts fan because I was brought up in Edinburgh, and as a Liverpool fan because Kenny Dalglish was my hero as a kid but now Sheffield Wednesday is my team. I\u2019m living a boyhood dream now, or manhood dream should I say, given the opportunity to take the team for a few games. You never know how long that will last so we will enjoy the ride as it goes.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/10/football-league-sheffield-wednesday-barnsley-championship-bolton-league-one\">Football League: Wednesday win again and embattled Bolton earn point</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It has seldom been dull over the past couple of years, with the club operating under a soft embargo this summer after submitting their 2017-18 accounts late and they were banned from signing players between April and August last year after breaching the profitability and sustainability rules. Last month, the club sold the stadium to owner Dejphon Chansiri for around \u00a360m to avoid breaching EFL rules, in the same way Mel Morris has done at Derby.</p> <p>When Chansiri calls mayday, Bullen is ostensibly Sheffield Wednesday\u2019s superhero. When Carlos Carvalhal was sacked, he stepped in for four games. When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/dec/21/sheffield-wednesday-jos-luhukay-right-time-to-go\" title=\"\">Jos Luhukay was dismissed in December,</a> Bullen went unbeaten in four games over the Christmas period. It is a case of so far so good this time around, with Bullen earning successive wins after being promoted from his role as first-team coach once more. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve got that managerial status it\u2019s your head that is on the chopping board,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re responsible for backroom staff, 30-odd players, 28,000 fans as per last Saturday. You get pats on the back when things are going well but you have to be ready for the knocks as well. This league can give you a bloody nose very, very quickly.\u201d</p> <p>Bullen is a big-hearted and classy character. When he restored the goalkeeper Keiren Westwood to the team during his last stint in interim charge following Luhukay\u2019s departure, he went around to Cameron Dawson\u2019s house to explain his decision out of respect. At the time he also explained how he would be found among the away fans at Middlesbrough if the club decided to go in a different direction without him.

      "bodyText": "A few days ago Chris Wilder joked that Billy Sharp is always stealing his thunder as \u201cMr Sheffield United\u201d \u2013 but across town, a couple of miles up the A61, it is increasingly easy to apply a similar moniker at Sheffield Wednesday, even if it is the kind of label with which Lee Bullen, the voice in the dugout at Hillsborough and the former club captain, is a little uncomfortable. A former defender who spent four years at the club as a player, Bullen has garnered maximum points at this embryonic stage \u2013 which translates to the club\u2019s best start to a season for 23 years \u2013 after picking up the pieces as caretaker manager for the third time in less than two years following the protracted departure of Steve Bruce. \u201cIt is a club that I now see as my own club,\u201d says Bullen. \u201cI came down to Sheffield Wednesday late on in my career, had a good few years on the playing side and really enjoyed it and I\u2019ve taken the club to my heart. I was brought up a Hearts fan because I was brought up in Edinburgh, and as a Liverpool fan because Kenny Dalglish was my hero as a kid but now Sheffield Wednesday is my team. I\u2019m living a boyhood dream now, or manhood dream should I say, given the opportunity to take the team for a few games. You never know how long that will last so we will enjoy the ride as it goes.\u201d It has seldom been dull over the past couple of years, with the club operating under a soft embargo this summer after submitting their 2017-18 accounts late and they were banned from signing players between April and August last year after breaching the profitability and sustainability rules. Last month, the club sold the stadium to owner Dejphon Chansiri for around \u00a360m to avoid breaching EFL rules, in the same way Mel Morris has done at Derby. When Chansiri calls mayday, Bullen is ostensibly Sheffield Wednesday\u2019s superhero. When Carlos Carvalhal was sacked, he stepped in for four games. When Jos Luhukay was dismissed in December, Bullen went unbeaten in four games over the Christmas period. It is a case of so far so good this time around, with Bullen earning successive wins after being promoted from his role as first-team coach once more. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve got that managerial status it\u2019s your head that is on the chopping board,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re responsible for backroom staff, 30-odd players, 28,000 fans as per last Saturday. You get pats on the back when things are going well but you have to be ready for the knocks as well. This league can give you a bloody nose very, very quickly.\u201d Bullen is a big-hearted and classy character. When he restored the goalkeeper Keiren Westwood to the team during his last stint in interim charge following Luhukay\u2019s departure, he went around to Cameron Dawson\u2019s house to explain his decision out of respect. At the time he also explained how he would be found among the away fans at Middlesbrough if the club decided to go in a different direction without him. Once again, the 48-year-old is certainly giving Chansiri food for thought. Asked if he wants the job on a permanent basis, Bullen says: \u201cI think I could do it going forward but I\u2019m not going to put words in the mouth of anybody out there. I will just carry on doing what we have been doing and hopefully the results can do the talking.\u201d Bruce\u2019s messy divorce after six months in charge rankled with a Wednesday fan-base that had garnered optimism from the green shoots on display at the end of last season, when they finished 12th. Impressive performances, notably wins over Nottingham Forest and Bristol City, a draw at Norwich City and even a narrow defeat at Elland Road, whet the appetite for this campaign. \u201cWe felt we had the right man in place but he\u2019s gone and we cannot quite dwell on it.

Because of the contribution of actor Laurence Clark, a self-styled \u201cirresponsible father\u201d, the show had already touched on parenthood, a theme that is likely to develop in this latest run. \u201cIt\u2019s even simple things like holding the babies,\u201d says Softley Gale. \u201cThey were born four weeks early, so they were pretty small. I thought, \u2018With my great clunky hands, how am I going to hold them? Am I going to hurt them?\u2019 But it\u2019s a concern every parent has. For me, the choice was, either I\u2019ll never hold them and they won\u2019t get any bond with me \u2013 and what\u2019s the point in that? \u2013 or I hold them and there might be a small risk. The way to avoid risk is to never have any contact with anybody. Every relationship is a risk, but we do it anyway.\u201d \u2022 Purposeless Movements is at the Studio, Edinburgh, 19-24 August.",

Under the change, college players\u2019 agents would, among other criteria, need to have a bachelor\u2019s degree.</p> <p>It was the type of bureaucratic change that might have gone unnoticed if it didn\u2019t seem to explicitly target Rich Paul of Klutch Sports, the 37-year-old super-agent whose client list includes NBA stars such as LeBron James, Anthony Davis, John Wall and Ben Simmons \u2013 and who happens to have not graduated from college. Almost as soon as it was quietly reported, James amplified it to his 43m followers on Twitter with a simple, shade-dripped hashtag.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/KingJames/status/1158883408438632449\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"und\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/TheRichPaulRule?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#TheRichPaulRule</a></p>&mdash; LeBron James (@KingJames) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KingJames/status/1158883408438632449?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 6, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>The questions rapidly mounted. Had an agent with Paul\u2019s influence upset the NCAA\u2019s power dynamic so dramatically it was forced to react? Was the rule racially tinged? After all, no one had an issue when super-agents Arn Tellem and David Falk, who are both white, were running the league in the 1990s like Frank Lucas and Nicky Barnes. Nothing against them, they were great agents who cornered the market in a different era.

      "bodyText": "The National Collegiate Athletic Association\u2019s risible Rich Paul Rule is the clearest indication yet that the governing body of collegiate sports in America is terrified their stranglehold on the amateur athletes who drive the billion-dollar industry of college basketball may soon be coming to an end. The controversial memo, first revealed last week, was a tweak that restricted who college basketball players hoping to enter the NBA could select as their agents. Under the change, college players\u2019 agents would, among other criteria, need to have a bachelor\u2019s degree. It was the type of bureaucratic change that might have gone unnoticed if it didn\u2019t seem to explicitly target Rich Paul of Klutch Sports, the 37-year-old super-agent whose client list includes NBA stars such as LeBron James, Anthony Davis, John Wall and Ben Simmons \u2013 and who happens to have not graduated from college. Almost as soon as it was quietly reported, James amplified it to his 43m followers on Twitter with a simple, shade-dripped hashtag. The questions rapidly mounted. Had an agent with Paul\u2019s influence upset the NCAA\u2019s power dynamic so dramatically it was forced to react? Was the rule racially tinged? After all, no one had an issue when super-agents Arn Tellem and David Falk, who are both white, were running the league in the 1990s like Frank Lucas and Nicky Barnes. Nothing against them, they were great agents who cornered the market in a different era. But now that it\u2019s a young black man gaining power, suddenly there\u2019s a problem that requires barriers to entry? Thanks largely to LeBron\u2019s social bullhorn, the backlash was immediate and severe enough for the NCAA to reverse course on the rule entirely this week. The question now is why they felt compelled to try it in the first place. Does the NCAA suddenly feel remorse for the way it has taken advantage of young athletes for decades? Will it now come up with a plan to fairly compensate college ballplayers instead of exploiting them \u2013 not unlike when a business goes into an underdeveloped country, sets up shop and pays its workers pennies a day while it reaps millions ... or, in the case of the NCAA, billions of dollars? Or was it because the rule came under highly visible criticism after James brought attention to it, prompting a cross-section of celebrities, media members and fellow NBA players to take turns dragging the NCAA in the public square? Ultimately, Paul himself chimed in with a blistering op-ed for the Athletic. \u201cThe harmful consequences of this decision will ricochet onto others who are trying to break in. NCAA executives are once again preventing young people from less prestigious backgrounds, and often people of color, from working in the system they continue to control,\u201d Paul wrote. \u201cIn this case, the people being locked out are kids who aspire to be an agent and work in the NBA and do not have the resources, opportunity or desire to get a four-year degree. Does anyone really believe a four-year degree is what separates an ethical person from a con artist?\u201d All fantastic points. Many have bought into the argument that the Rich Paul Rule was evidence the NCAA genuinely cares about its student-athletes. That it\u2019s an attempt to protect young athletes from shady hucksters selling their guidance without possessing the qualifications needed to properly give that counsel. Or that Paul isn\u2019t representing players testing the waters, but rather top-flight prospects who are certain to get chosen in the draft \u2013 so this rule couldn\u2019t possibly be aimed to undermine his success but instead represents an earnest attempt by the NCAA to do what it can to protect and serve its student-athletes. Others have argued the rule was in response to the recent NCAA corruption scandal, the FBI probe which targeted a conspiracy of coaches, agents and shoe companies buying, bribing and selling players, resulting in multiple players being suspended or declared ineligible, and several big-name programs and coaches getting sanctioned or fired. The thinking goes the NCAA wanted to make a gesture of self-regulation to get in front of the curve before the hammer of government intervention was brought down. To me, there\u2019s one far more likely explanation: the NCAA drew up a new set of rules that represented a naked attempt to reassert its dominance and control over young athletes who have (correctly) become convinced that their talent is worth a lot more than a scholarship, room and board and their meal plan. The NCAA remains dedicated to destroying the competition, limiting the athlete\u2019s value and extracting the surplus at a maximum volume. And now feels threatened it is losing its hold on the minds of NBA prospects who once viewed the NCAA as the only road to achieving their professional dreams.

      "body": "<p>It was in Greenbushes in the south-west of Western Australia during the second world war that Graham Farmer got his nickname. According to many sources, it was because of his incessant talking. It was the parrot-like way that Farmer would talk that endeared him to so many.</p> <p>Born in Fremantle on 10 March 1935 at the height of the Depression, Farmer\u2019s mixed descent would mark him for different reasons. It is believed his mother could not support him and as a consequence he was given up to the institution known as Sister Kate\u2019s Children\u2019s Home. Farmer would come to see the place as his home, growing up with his boyhood friend Square Kilmurray. They would go on to play together at Kenwick Football Club and then East Perth.</p> <p>Farmer was inventive as a young footballer. His light frame dictated the need to master two things: his fear of being hurt and timing his leap at the ball when going for mark and the ruck. The latter would enable him to get the advantage that every player playing the Indigenous game wants \u2013 possession.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/14/afl-trailblazer-graham-polly-farmer-dies-aged-84\">Indigenous AFL trailblazer Graham 'Polly' Farmer dies aged 84</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is not to say Farmer got it easy. He had to battle state authorities who wanted to send him to the West Australian hinterland to work the land. This was the key policy of the day.

      "bodyText": "It was in Greenbushes in the south-west of Western Australia during the second world war that Graham Farmer got his nickname. According to many sources, it was because of his incessant talking. It was the parrot-like way that Farmer would talk that endeared him to so many. Born in Fremantle on 10 March 1935 at the height of the Depression, Farmer\u2019s mixed descent would mark him for different reasons. It is believed his mother could not support him and as a consequence he was given up to the institution known as Sister Kate\u2019s Children\u2019s Home. Farmer would come to see the place as his home, growing up with his boyhood friend Square Kilmurray. They would go on to play together at Kenwick Football Club and then East Perth. Farmer was inventive as a young footballer. His light frame dictated the need to master two things: his fear of being hurt and timing his leap at the ball when going for mark and the ruck. The latter would enable him to get the advantage that every player playing the Indigenous game wants \u2013 possession. This is not to say Farmer got it easy. He had to battle state authorities who wanted to send him to the West Australian hinterland to work the land. This was the key policy of the day. Only due to his ability to play so well and a petition by the Sunday Times to stop Farmer from going bush did the Native Welfare Department provide him with permission to stay in Perth. As Steve Hawke writes in his great biography of Farmer: \u201cThe only thing I did not want to be doing was farming.\u201d Without Polly Farmer\u2019s name being synonymous with quality football, we would never had of heard of him.

The chair of the committee, Liberal MP Julian Leeser, told Guardian Australia that the quality of life of the nation depended on solving the policy challenge of how to better redistribute Australia\u2019s population, which will increase 25% in the next 15 years to 31.4 million. Most of that growth is forecast to take place in Australia\u2019s four biggest cities of Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth. Leeser said the inquiry would not look at changing the current levels of migration after the government announced it would cap the number of permanent visa places offered each year at 160,000. \u201cIt is not about the total number.

The announcement of the new committee comes after an Infrastructure Australia report that found $40bn in annual infrastructure spending was needed to cope with a forecast population of 31.4 million by 2034, warning that cities were not coping with the current rate of population growth. Leeser, who represents the seat of Berowra in Sydney, said he often heard concerns among constituents about population growth in the city. \u201cPeople in my electorate often say to me that we have too many people in Sydney and that they supported very strongly the government\u2019s cap on migration, but when you say to people the economy needs people, they say \u2018well we should have more people move to regional Australia\u2019, and that is borne out by the fact that we have got all these jobs that aren\u2019t filled in regional Australia.\u201d He said that regions offered a \u201cvery high quality of life\u201d and he hoped the inquiry would hear from people who had chosen to \u201cmove and stay\u201d in regional areas. \u201cIt is one of the added advantages of people going to regional Australia \u2013 cost of living is cheaper getting around is easier, and there are many opportunities there. \u201cBut we won\u2019t maintain that quality of life, and that is not just the quality of life in regional Australia, that is the quality of life nationally, if business can\u2019t fill jobs that they need people to do in order for the business to keep growing.\u201d",

Trenitalia has been named \u201cshadow operator\u201d for HS2, with responsibility for introducing new services but with a caveat that it may not go ahead, depending on the outcome of reviews into the construction of the high-speed network and the shape of the entire rail industry. First-Trenitalia will pay \u00a31.6bn in premiums to run the West Coast services \u2013 Britain\u2019s most lucrative line \u2013 from this December until 2026, with a second phase of payments to depend on HS2. The contract could run until 2034 with an extension. Keith Williams, who is leading the government\u2019s rail review and has already said that franchising must change, endorsed the West Coast Partnership contract as \u201ca step forward that is firmly in line with the review \u2026 capable of incorporating the reforms needed for the future\u201d. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said the contract was \u201ca decisive shift towards a new model for rail \u2026 built with the flexibility to respond to [Williams\u2019] recommendations and deliver fundamental reform to a flawed system\u201d. Shapps also confirmed he would proceed with a white paper for reforming rail, based on Williams\u2019 findings, which are due in the autumn \u2013 continuing the review commissioned by his predecessor, Chris Grayling. The Department for Transport pressed ahead with the west coast award despite a high court case being brought by Stagecoach, Sir Richard Branson\u2019s partner in Virgin Rail. Branson said he was \u201cdevastated\u201d by the decision. Stagecoach was disqualified for a non-compliant bid, refusing to accept pension liabilities, but is seeking to have the decision overturned \u2013 a legal action that recalls the fiasco in 2012 when the west coast contract was awarded to FirstGroup but then withdrawn after Virgin\u2019s complaints. Stagecoach said the award of the franchise would not have an impact on its continuing litigation against the DfT. First\u2019s biggest shareholder, Coast Capital, has threatened to sue the board of the company if it took on any more rail contracts. James Rasteh, partner at Coast, told the Guardian earlier this year it would \u201chold each member of the management team and [each] board member personally and fully accountable if the company enters any new rail franchise\u201d. The previous two UK rail franchise competitions won by First \u2013 TransPennine and South Western \u2013 have proved costly to the company.First wrote down the value of its TransPennine franchise by \u00a3106m last year and last month followed up with an \u201conerous contract provision\u201d of \u00a3102m for South Western. Earlier this year, First suggested it could turn its back on UK rail after the expiry of its current contracts, which also include Great Western Railway and the small, open access Hull Trains. On Wednesday First said its board \u201cremains very aware of concerns expressed by shareholders regarding rail \u2026 however, it has unanimously concluded that signing the partnership agreement is in the best interests of all shareholders\u201d. Labour queried the award, given the scale of First\u2019s debts and recent losses, and following the cancellation of the Southeastern franchise competition. The shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, said that awarding First such a complex contract was \u201ca gross error of judgment\u201d. The contract will involve handling the first HS2 services from 2026 until 2031, should the project survive despite budget challenges. High-speed trains are planned to run north on the existing mainline after the first phase of the high-speed network opens between London and Birmingham. All bidders had to demonstrate experience of running high-speed rail services, which led to First bringing onboard Trenitalia, which runs TGVs in Italy. Direct, conventional trains from London to new destinations including Gobowen, Walsall and Liverpool South Parkway are also promised in the new partnership contract. The RMT union said the award, coming on the day higher rail fares are confirmed, was \u201canothe\u200er political fix by a government whose privatised franchise model is collapsing around their ears\u201d. Its general secretary, Mick Cash, said the government was \u201ctaking yet another gamble on the crucial west coast lines with one of the dwindling number of private operator consortia left in the game\u201d.",

However, the New Zealand prime minister stopped short of saying New Zealand would throw its weight behind the smaller Pacific nations who are urging Australia to commit to a rapid transition from a coal-based economy at this year\u2019s Pacific Islands Forum. \u201cIssues around Australia\u2019s domestic policy are issues for Australia,\u201d she said, when asked about Australia\u2019s coal use. Ardern said she had \u201cevery expectation that this Pacific Islands Forum will be dominated by climate change\u201d and reiterated her government\u2019s commitment to reducing emissions, citing the goal of reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2035, which is currently working its way through New Zealand parliament. \u201cLike our Pacific Island neighbours, we will continue that international call, we will continue to say that New Zealand will do our bit and we have an expectation that everyone else will as well; we have to.\u201d Pacific leaders have this week been urging Australia to commit to urgent action to reduce emissions. On Monday, the Fijian prime minister, Frank Bainimarama, appealed to Australia in a speech \u201cto do everything possible to achieve a rapid transition from coal to energy sources that do not contribute to climate change\u201d, saying it posed an \u201cexistential threat\u201d to Pacific islands. Ardern refused to comment on reports that Australia has been attempting to water down the language on climate change in the communique that is due to come out of the PIF on Thursday after the leaders\u2019 retreat. Climate Home News reported that an annotated draft of the Pacific Islands Forum declaration showed Australia trying to suppress references to the climate \u201ccrisis\u201d, 1.5C, carbon neutrality, a ban on new coal plants and phasing out of fossil fuel subsidies. Greenpeace said that Australia\u2019s plans to water down the communique could see it become \u201cthe pariah of the Pacific\u201d. \u201cHow does Morrison reconcile calling the Pacific family while he persistently ignores our demands for Australia to reduce its emissions?\u201d said Joseph Moeono-Kolio, Greenpeace\u2019s head of Pacific. Scott Morrison, who touched down in Funafuti about an hour after Ardern, set a positive tone in his first public speaking appearance, at the launch of a Pacific skills portal, at which he did not take questions. Morrison said the Pacific Islands Forum was a \u201cfamily gathering\u201d and that \u201cwhen families come together they talk about the stuff that matters, that\u2019s most important to them. Over the next few days that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ll do.\u201d His only reference to what are anticipated to be heated debates on the climate crisis was to say the leaders would be \u201ctalking about the future of our environment\u201d as part of their discussions, as well as the future of our economies and jobs. Morrison cited his government\u2019s renewed focus on the region, the so-called Pacific Step-Up, saying, as he has several times before: \u201cIf you\u2019re going to step up you have to show up, and Australia\u2019s going to show up, we\u2019re not just going to show up here, we\u2019re going to show up for the hard conversations, the good conversations, the family conversations that we have, that\u2019s very much the spirit with which we\u2019re engaging.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>It must be something to do with being at the back all the time, but give a drummer their moment in the spotlight and there\u2019s no holding them back. At least three one-man shows on the Edinburgh fringe put the drums centre stage and none of the performers misses the chance to demonstrate their mastery of the backbeat, the jazz shuffle or the military snare roll.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt was the drums that chose me,\u201d says Daniel Bellus\u2019s Alfie as he gets behind his red Yamaha kit in <strong>Beat</strong> (<strong>\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606</strong>), a Moli\u00e8re award-nominated monologue by <a href=\"https://sitproductions.co.uk/our-productions/beat/\">C\u00e9dric Chapuis</a> and the cream of this drum-driven crop. Dressed all in white, Bellus is nervy, wide-eyed and eager to please. It\u2019s never stated, but you assume his character is somewhere on the autistic spectrum, a teenage boy who is perplexed by human interactions but blissfully content when counting out a rhythm. He\u2019s held back at school, frequently in trouble over misunderstandings, but comes into his own when finally he gets behind a drum kit. By the end, it becomes his way of connecting to the world.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e0db936e34f3d069224791b389622eabd2a26755\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e0db936e34f3d069224791b389622eabd2a26755/0_0_4429_2953/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Daniel Bellus in Beat.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Charm and musical dexterity \u2026 Daniel Bellus in Beat.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eleanor Kelly</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>From his discovery of Buddy Rich and Art Blakey in his grandmother\u2019s record collection, he graduates to a rap rendition of I Wandered Lonely As a Cloud and a four-to-the-floor cover of Highway to Hell. The play ends clunkily, but for as long as Alfie is struggling against uncomprehending parents, classmates and teachers, we\u2019re with him every beat of the way. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a musical instrument, it\u2019s a beating heart,\u201d says Bellus and, in St\u00e9phane Batlle\u2019s production, he has the charm and musical dexterity to make us feel it.</p> \n<figure class=\"element

      "bodyText": "It must be something to do with being at the back all the time, but give a drummer their moment in the spotlight and there\u2019s no holding them back. At least three one-man shows on the Edinburgh fringe put the drums centre stage and none of the performers misses the chance to demonstrate their mastery of the backbeat, the jazz shuffle or the military snare roll. \u201cIt was the drums that chose me,\u201d says Daniel Bellus\u2019s Alfie as he gets behind his red Yamaha kit in Beat (\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606), a Moli\u00e8re award-nominated monologue by C\u00e9dric Chapuis and the cream of this drum-driven crop. Dressed all in white, Bellus is nervy, wide-eyed and eager to please. It\u2019s never stated, but you assume his character is somewhere on the autistic spectrum, a teenage boy who is perplexed by human interactions but blissfully content when counting out a rhythm. He\u2019s held back at school, frequently in trouble over misunderstandings, but comes into his own when finally he gets behind a drum kit. By the end, it becomes his way of connecting to the world. From his discovery of Buddy Rich and Art Blakey in his grandmother\u2019s record collection, he graduates to a rap rendition of I Wandered Lonely As a Cloud and a four-to-the-floor cover of Highway to Hell. The play ends clunkily, but for as long as Alfie is struggling against uncomprehending parents, classmates and teachers, we\u2019re with him every beat of the way. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a musical instrument, it\u2019s a beating heart,\u201d says Bellus and, in St\u00e9phane Batlle\u2019s production, he has the charm and musical dexterity to make us feel it. It\u2019s been a while since Charlie Chuck saw the potential of drums in standup comedy, so perhaps there\u2019s a gap in the market for comedian Alexander Fox (\u201cslave to the rhythm, intern to the boogie\u201d).

But his real task is to check the couple on board have the licence to fish in this part of the Port Honduras Marine Reserve, one of nine designated zones in Belize.</p> <p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t complaining but others do,\u201d says Alonzo Reymundo, of the rules that now restrict Belize\u2019s 3,000 commercial fishers to two geographic areas each. He and his wife Anselma have been fishing off southern Toledo for 30 years and their boat is laden with 50 or so pounds of shrimp \u2013 more than enough, he says, flashing his licence. Today\u2019s catch will be sold as bait and fetch around 330BZ$ (\u00a3135), he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"75c4b36eb2cda397a681f5da239cabccaefbad18\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/75c4b36eb2cda397a681f5da239cabccaefbad18/0_0_2500_1667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A husband/wife team cast netting for shrimp in the Port Honduras Marine Reserve, southern Belize.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">You now need a licence to fish in Belize\u2019s closely managed waters</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tony Rath Photography</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But not all encounters are as friendly for the rangers from the Toledo Institute for Development and Environment (<a href=\"https://tidebelize.org/\">Tide</a>), whose job includes enforcing the <a href=\"https://belize.wcs.org/Initiatives/Managed-Access-Program.aspx\">managed access (MA) programme</a> that since 2016 has given traditional fishers the rights to secured grounds if they obtain licences and report their catch. Illegal fishing has declined, says Halliday, but at night there are illicit incursions from Guatemala and high-speed chases around the reserve\u2019s 500-square miles of pristine sea \u2013 a vast space to monitor for just four rangers alternating shifts at their station on Abalone Caye.</p> <p>Covering all of Belize\u2019s waters, the MA scheme is unique, says fisheries administrator Beverly Wade. \u201cBelize is the only country in the world that has successfully <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/fishery/facp/BLZ/en\">divided all its territorial waters</a>, including functional fishing waters. We direct all fishermen into two of nine areas to build an architecture from the ground up, where a constituent takes ownership of resources because their livelihood depends on it.\u201d</p> <p>The programme is just part of a groundbreaking approach to ocean protection that has won the tiny country in Central America a reputation as a world leader.</p> <p>Most recently, in April, Belize <a href=\"https://news.mongabay.com/2019/04/belize-to-nearly-triple-area-under-strict-marine-protected-areas/\">expanded </a>the replenishment or \u201cno-take\u201d zones in its marine protected areas from 4.5% to 11.6%, almost tripling zones where fishing is banned, to rebuild fish populations and protect marine habitats. \u201cNowadays it\u2019s sexy to say \u2018this is a no-take area\u2019 somewhere miles out at sea,\u201d says Wade, at her office in Belize City, \u201cbut our no-take zone of 16% is a giant achievement for a tiny country like Belize, because all our protected areas are right where people are interacting on a daily basis. That is the hardest thing to achieve.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bde240bd195583714fd02c5cc3e18f20f1189d6e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bde240bd195583714fd02c5cc3e18f20f1189d6e/0_76_2500_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rangers check licenses as part of the managed access programme in the Port Honduras Marine Reserve.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rangers enforce the rules by checking licences, but illegal fishing still occurs, especially at night</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tony Rath Photography</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While in other Caribbean countries like Jamaica and the Bahamas, overfishing has depleted stocks of lobster and conch, such steps are helping ensure this does not happen in Belize, she says. MA has had faster results than anticipated, with an estimated 60% fall in illegal fishing, benefiting the two primary seafood exports. \u201cThe fact that our lobster and conch have remained stable is a direct indicator of the success of the combination of protected areas and managed access,\u201d says Wade.</p> <p>Other countries could learn from how Belize persuaded its fishers to give up open access to its waters, says Nicanor Requena, who spent almost a decade visiting remote fishing communities with the US-based Environmental Defence Fund (EDF). \u201cAt first they didn\u2019t want to know, but we gained their trust by listening to them, and fishers\u2019 traditional knowledge played a huge part in shaping the programme,\u201d he says.</p> <p>That message has even been echoed in a weekly radio drama about a fictional fishing village called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCCngwSah1A\">Punta Fuego</a>, with storylines about illegal fishing and characters tempted to make a quick Belizean dollar, with a phone-in to discuss the risks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b13f993fc7d0cdd6a44eba8ecb403eee2a4cf49e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b13f993fc7d0cdd6a44eba8ecb403eee2a4cf49e/0_0_1667_2500/667.jpg\" alt=\"Fisherman unload the night catch at the docks of the Punta Gorda market.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Local fishers\u2019 knowledge has shaped the management programme</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tony Rath Photography</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But it was two pilot programmes in the Port Honduras and Glover\u2019s Reef reserves that proved to fishers the rights system would secure their livelihoods and win ecological payback: the recovery and preservation of Belize\u2019s outstanding barrier reef \u2013 the largest in the northern hemisphere \u2013 on which nearly 200,000 people rely because of tourism and fishing. Other countries, including Australia and the Philippines, have been taking note and looking to emulate tiny Belize.</p> <p>Bordered by Mexico, Guatemala and the Caribbean sea, Belize is home to a 300km stretch of the Mesoamerican barrier reef, whose stunning array of fish includes whale sharks, angelfish and parrotfish, and dozens of species of coral. In what was hailed as a hugely significant point for marine conservation worldwide, the reef was removed from <a href=\"https://whc.unesco.org/en/news/1838\">Unesco\u2019s World Heritage danger list</a> in June 2018, after 10 years. That followed the introduction of regulations to protect mangroves and, crucially, a vote by Belize\u2019s government for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/jan/14/belize-bans-oil-activity-to-protect-reef-diving-tourism-belize-barrier-reef\">an indefinite moratorium </a>on all new oil exploration in its waters, after thousands of citizens joined with environmental groups to push for a referendum on the issue. In its 2018 <a href=\"http://www.healthyreefs.org/cms/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/2018-MAR-Report-Card-Web.pdf\">report card </a>on the health of its reef Belize scored 2.8 \u2013 an improvement on 2.3 in 2006, though some way off the top score of five.</p> <p>The gains are impressive but also fragile, says Nicole Auil Gomez, of the Wildlife Conservation Society, whose scientific research has played a leading role in conservation efforts. \u201cOur actions have been moving faster than the legislation. Now we need laws to buttress this action. Everyone is waiting for the sustainable fisheries bill, which will close loopholes, for example, by making enforcement easier.\u201d</p> <p>Wade agrees that stiffer penalties in the long-awaited implementation of the bill would help. \u201cEnforcement is our achilles heel because illegal fishing is so hard to police. We are a small country and simply don\u2019t have the resources. We were confiscating boats but noticed the penalties weren\u2019t as effective as they should be.\u201d</p> <p>At the national fishing cooperative in Belize City, today\u2019s catch of spiny lobster are being processed as chairman Elmer Rodriguez listens to some fishermen complain that they don\u2019t have licences because the machine that prints them has broken down. But all agree the key problem with MA is enforcement, especially of foreign fishers who still use gill nets that damage fish. There is not enough patrolling or monitoring, says Rodriguez. \u201cWhy should they follow the rules when others just break them?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1d13e698de73ace592ed2742e398cdea6660b630\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1d13e698de73ace592ed2742e398cdea6660b630/0_162_1667_1667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elmer Rodriguez, chairman of the national fishermen\u2019s cooperative.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elmer Rodriguez, chairman of the national fishermen\u2019s cooperative, says enforcement of fishing rules is an issue</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tony Rath Photography</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Toledo, Tide\u2019s executive director Celia Mahung says: \u201cI strongly believe the government needs to budget for enforcement. The cost of fuel is so high and NGOs don\u2019t get tax reduction to buy fuel, although they are doing the government\u2019s work.\u201d</p> <p>Talking to environmentalists in Belize, there is a clear sense of pride in their success, along with fishers, scientists, the government and others, but also pressure to keep up sustainable initiatives.

      "bodyText": "Across the turquoise water by the mangrove, ranger Allan Halliday spots a fishing skiff. \u201cWe\u2019re going over to say hello,\u201d he says, before abruptly changing the boat\u2019s direction. But his real task is to check the couple on board have the licence to fish in this part of the Port Honduras Marine Reserve, one of nine designated zones in Belize. \u201cWe aren\u2019t complaining but others do,\u201d says Alonzo Reymundo, of the rules that now restrict Belize\u2019s 3,000 commercial fishers to two geographic areas each. He and his wife Anselma have been fishing off southern Toledo for 30 years and their boat is laden with 50 or so pounds of shrimp \u2013 more than enough, he says, flashing his licence. Today\u2019s catch will be sold as bait and fetch around 330BZ$ (\u00a3135), he says. But not all encounters are as friendly for the rangers from the Toledo Institute for Development and Environment (Tide), whose job includes enforcing the managed access (MA) programme that since 2016 has given traditional fishers the rights to secured grounds if they obtain licences and report their catch. Illegal fishing has declined, says Halliday, but at night there are illicit incursions from Guatemala and high-speed chases around the reserve\u2019s 500-square miles of pristine sea \u2013 a vast space to monitor for just four rangers alternating shifts at their station on Abalone Caye. Covering all of Belize\u2019s waters, the MA scheme is unique, says fisheries administrator Beverly Wade. \u201cBelize is the only country in the world that has successfully divided all its territorial waters, including functional fishing waters. We direct all fishermen into two of nine areas to build an architecture from the ground up, where a constituent takes ownership of resources because their livelihood depends on it.\u201d The programme is just part of a groundbreaking approach to ocean protection that has won the tiny country in Central America a reputation as a world leader. Most recently, in April, Belize expanded the replenishment or \u201cno-take\u201d zones in its marine protected areas from 4.5% to 11.6%, almost tripling zones where fishing is banned, to rebuild fish populations and protect marine habitats. \u201cNowadays it\u2019s sexy to say \u2018this is a no-take area\u2019 somewhere miles out at sea,\u201d says Wade, at her office in Belize City, \u201cbut our no-take zone of 16% is a giant achievement for a tiny country like Belize, because all our protected areas are right where people are interacting on a daily basis. That is the hardest thing to achieve.\u201d While in other Caribbean countries like Jamaica and the Bahamas, overfishing has depleted stocks of lobster and conch, such steps are helping ensure this does not happen in Belize, she says. MA has had faster results than anticipated, with an estimated 60% fall in illegal fishing, benefiting the two primary seafood exports. \u201cThe fact that our lobster and conch have remained stable is a direct indicator of the success of the combination of protected areas and managed access,\u201d says Wade. Other countries could learn from how Belize persuaded its fishers to give up open access to its waters, says Nicanor Requena, who spent almost a decade visiting remote fishing communities with the US-based Environmental Defence Fund (EDF). \u201cAt first they didn\u2019t want to know, but we gained their trust by listening to them, and fishers\u2019 traditional knowledge played a huge part in shaping the programme,\u201d he says. That message has even been echoed in a weekly radio drama about a fictional fishing village called Punta Fuego, with storylines about illegal fishing and characters tempted to make a quick Belizean dollar, with a phone-in to discuss the risks. But it was two pilot programmes in the Port Honduras and Glover\u2019s Reef reserves that proved to fishers the rights system would secure their livelihoods and win ecological payback: the recovery and preservation of Belize\u2019s outstanding barrier reef \u2013 the largest in the northern hemisphere \u2013 on which nearly 200,000 people rely because of tourism and fishing. Other countries, including Australia and the Philippines, have been taking note and looking to emulate tiny Belize. Bordered by Mexico, Guatemala and the Caribbean sea, Belize is home to a 300km stretch of the Mesoamerican barrier reef, whose stunning array of fish includes whale sharks, angelfish and parrotfish, and dozens of species of coral. In what was hailed as a hugely significant point for marine conservation worldwide, the reef was removed from Unesco\u2019s World Heritage danger list in June 2018, after 10 years. That followed the introduction of regulations to protect mangroves and, crucially, a vote by Belize\u2019s government for an indefinite moratorium on all new oil exploration in its waters, after thousands of citizens joined with environmental groups to push for a referendum on the issue. In its 2018 report card on the health of its reef Belize scored 2.8 \u2013 an improvement on 2.3 in 2006, though some way off the top score of five. The gains are impressive but also fragile, says Nicole Auil Gomez, of the Wildlife Conservation Society, whose scientific research has played a leading role in conservation efforts. \u201cOur actions have been moving faster than the legislation. Now we need laws to buttress this action. Everyone is waiting for the sustainable fisheries bill, which will close loopholes, for example, by making enforcement easier.\u201d Wade agrees that stiffer penalties in the long-awaited implementation of the bill would help. \u201cEnforcement is our achilles heel because illegal fishing is so hard to police. We are a small country and simply don\u2019t have the resources. We were confiscating boats but noticed the penalties weren\u2019t as effective as they should be.\u201d At the national fishing cooperative in Belize City, today\u2019s catch of spiny lobster are being processed as chairman Elmer Rodriguez listens to some fishermen complain that they don\u2019t have licences because the machine that prints them has broken down. But all agree the key problem with MA is enforcement, especially of foreign fishers who still use gill nets that damage fish. There is not enough patrolling or monitoring, says Rodriguez. \u201cWhy should they follow the rules when others just break them?\u201d In Toledo, Tide\u2019s executive director Celia Mahung says: \u201cI strongly believe the government needs to budget for enforcement. The cost of fuel is so high and NGOs don\u2019t get tax reduction to buy fuel, although they are doing the government\u2019s work.\u201d Talking to environmentalists in Belize, there is a clear sense of pride in their success, along with fishers, scientists, the government and others, but also pressure to keep up sustainable initiatives. A bigger commitment is needed from the tourist industry, which accounts for almost 40% of GDP, they say. One species that is still suffering the effects of overfishing is the Nassau grouper fish whose declining numbers are like \u201cwatching extinction in action\u201d, says Auil Gomez. Compounding the challenges is the climate crisis. Emerging threats include Belize\u2019s white sand beaches being swamped by sargassum ocean seaweed and the arrival of the mysterious stony coral disease, which is believed to be linked to warming ocean waters. \u201cThe weather is more unpredictable, the seas are rougher and fishers have to go farther out. We have seen a lot of coastal erosion,\u201d says Mahung, adding that the shrinking numbers and size of fish are forcing communities to look for new sources of income. Before heading back to the mainland, the Tide rangers stop for lunch in Punta Negra, where village chairperson Paula Jacobs Williams serves red snapper and rice in the building that used to be the school. She co-runs this restaurant with three other women, as part of a project to diversify income in fishing communities.

But the producer Sheila Nevins encouraged Peltz to focus on the one subject everyone both shared and wanted to avoid. \u201cShe said, \u2018You know what? We\u2019re taking our eye off the ball,\u2019\u201d recalled Peltz. \u201cWe\u2019re all looking at how to stay alive longer and quality of life, but really the one thing we all share is that we\u2019re all going to die.\u201d</p> <p>The experience of death \u2013 how to honor a loved one, how to plan your final hours, how to laugh in one\u2019s own sunset \u2013 form the through-line of Alternate Endings, which, as O\u2019Neill told the Guardian, \u201cbrings you, in intimate, granular detail, into the lives of people who are very consciously figuring out how they want to handle their own end of life, and how to do it in a thoughtful, conscious, positive way\u201d.</p> <p>After five minutes of exploring the funeral market floor, Alternate Endings fades to a more tranquil view: a balcony overlooking the Gulf of Mexico, where Leila Johnson labors over a letter to her recently deceased father.

Around 10-15 minutes in length, the individual stories \u2013 poignant, moving, punctuated by laughter even as one\u2019s window is closing \u2013 offer a glimpse into a more conscientious way, for those lucky with time, to define one\u2019s passage on the earth.</p> <p>Peltz and O\u2019Neill found their six families through a series of networks, from end-of-life groups to funeral parlors to death doulas. Being a two-person crew allowed them to develop relationships with subjects that were \u201cvery intimate\u201d, said O\u2019Neill. \u201cFrom the beginning, we said: we really want to be part of this.

The families who did consent to filming \u201chad a shared sense of purpose with us as film-makers that there\u2019s real value in provoking a conversation about death and end of life and choices\u201d, said O\u2019Neill. \u201cI think each of these families shared that sense of a mission in this.\u201d</p> <p>Besides Johnson and her father\u2019s memorial reef, Peltz and O\u2019Neill attend a living wake for the ailing Guadalupe Cuevas hosted by his boisterous family; a lunch date between Barbara Jean, a terminal cancer patient, and her best friend as they pick her plot for an environmentally friendly \u201cgreen burial\u201d; the launch of a rocket carrying Sara Snider Green\u2019s father\u2019s ashes to space; Dick Shannon\u2019s last supper before he ends his cancer battle with a drug cocktail, an occasion that is searingly heavy and comforting at once; and the celebration of life party \u2013 bouncy houses and snow-cone machine included \u2013 for Emily and Ryan Mathias\u2019s five-year-old son <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jul/13/garrett-matthias-boy-writes-own-obituary-cancer\">Garrett</a>, who requested, before his death from cancer, that he not have a sad funeral.</p> <p>The portraits are \u201cwildly different\u201d, said O\u2019Neill, but linked by \u201ca deep love and respect in each of the stories, for the people who are trying to navigate these moments.

Death is a topic characterized by avoidance and discomfort, but \u201cwe\u2019ve all got to figure it out\u201d, said O\u2019Neill. \u201cThe stories that were shared with us, we think, are really constructive for other people to use and reflect on and pivot off of and provoke, hopefully, that conversation that you weren\u2019t sure you wanted to have with your mother, or your brother, or your child.\u201d</p> <p>Peltz added that even having the conversation was a step in a positive direction. The film demonstrates that, of course, there are moments of sadness inherent in such discussions. \u201cBut they are conversations worth having,\u201d she said, \u201cand the people\u2019s lives that we\u2019ve followed and their stories are inspiring and empowering and uplifting.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p>Alternate Endings: Six Ways to Die in America premieres on HBO on 14 August and in the UK soon</p></li> </ul>",

Many Americans hardly stop to interrogate why we consider it normal, if not necessary, to go about the elaborate ritual of embalming to coffin to six feet underground. Peltz hardly thought about it, either, until she started on a film that was originally focused on extending time before the grave. \u201cWho doesn\u2019t want to know about what\u2019s happening in this space, about extending life, about new molecules that are being created that hopefully will extend the lifespan?\u201d Peltz asked. But the producer Sheila Nevins encouraged Peltz to focus on the one subject everyone both shared and wanted to avoid. \u201cShe said, \u2018You know what? We\u2019re taking our eye off the ball,\u2019\u201d recalled Peltz. \u201cWe\u2019re all looking at how to stay alive longer and quality of life, but really the one thing we all share is that we\u2019re all going to die.\u201d The experience of death \u2013 how to honor a loved one, how to plan your final hours, how to laugh in one\u2019s own sunset \u2013 form the through-line of Alternate Endings, which, as O\u2019Neill told the Guardian, \u201cbrings you, in intimate, granular detail, into the lives of people who are very consciously figuring out how they want to handle their own end of life, and how to do it in a thoughtful, conscious, positive way\u201d. After five minutes of exploring the funeral market floor, Alternate Endings fades to a more tranquil view: a balcony overlooking the Gulf of Mexico, where Leila Johnson labors over a letter to her recently deceased father. She and her family have arrived to place her father\u2019s ashes in a \u201cmemorial reef\u201d, a cement stand that works as both grave and replacement for devastating coral loss. Johnson\u2019s vignette \u2013 reflecting on how best to send the memory of her ocean-loving father along, mixing ashes with cement and tears with laughter \u2013 is one of the film\u2019s six alternate endings. Around 10-15 minutes in length, the individual stories \u2013 poignant, moving, punctuated by laughter even as one\u2019s window is closing \u2013 offer a glimpse into a more conscientious way, for those lucky with time, to define one\u2019s passage on the earth. Peltz and O\u2019Neill found their six families through a series of networks, from end-of-life groups to funeral parlors to death doulas. Being a two-person crew allowed them to develop relationships with subjects that were \u201cvery intimate\u201d, said O\u2019Neill. \u201cFrom the beginning, we said: we really want to be part of this. We want to show this in all of its detail and we think there\u2019s a value in an audience understanding your situation fully.\u201d They had many insightful conversations with families, he said, that did not translate into filming, because of hesitations over the intimacy of the cameras; at certain points in Alternate Endings, they capture a loved one\u2019s final goodbye or last breath. The families who did consent to filming \u201chad a shared sense of purpose with us as film-makers that there\u2019s real value in provoking a conversation about death and end of life and choices\u201d, said O\u2019Neill. \u201cI think each of these families shared that sense of a mission in this.\u201d Besides Johnson and her father\u2019s memorial reef, Peltz and O\u2019Neill attend a living wake for the ailing Guadalupe Cuevas hosted by his boisterous family; a lunch date between Barbara Jean, a terminal cancer patient, and her best friend as they pick her plot for an environmentally friendly \u201cgreen burial\u201d; the launch of a rocket carrying Sara Snider Green\u2019s father\u2019s ashes to space; Dick Shannon\u2019s last supper before he ends his cancer battle with a drug cocktail, an occasion that is searingly heavy and comforting at once; and the celebration of life party \u2013 bouncy houses and snow-cone machine included \u2013 for Emily and Ryan Mathias\u2019s five-year-old son Garrett, who requested, before his death from cancer, that he not have a sad funeral. The portraits are \u201cwildly different\u201d, said O\u2019Neill, but linked by \u201ca deep love and respect in each of the stories, for the people who are trying to navigate these moments. Part of that love is humor, part of that love is thoughtful conversation.\u201d Both Peltz and O\u2019Neill maintain that those conversations \u2013 the potential to look at the end of life directly, with dignity instead of fear \u2013 hold the purpose for the film. Death is a topic characterized by avoidance and discomfort, but \u201cwe\u2019ve all got to figure it out\u201d, said O\u2019Neill. \u201cThe stories that were shared with us, we think, are really constructive for other people to use and reflect on and pivot off of and provoke, hopefully, that conversation that you weren\u2019t sure you wanted to have with your mother, or your brother, or your child.\u201d Peltz added that even having the conversation was a step in a positive direction. The film demonstrates that, of course, there are moments of sadness inherent in such discussions. \u201cBut they are conversations worth having,\u201d she said, \u201cand the people\u2019s lives that we\u2019ve followed and their stories are inspiring and empowering and uplifting.\u201d Alternate Endings: Six Ways to Die in America premieres on HBO on 14 August and in the UK soon",

      "bodyText": "Australia has been accused of using a loophole to back out of a promised emissions cut nearly eight times greater than the combined annual fossil fuel pollution released by the rest of the Pacific. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, arrived in Tuvalu for the Pacific Islands Forum on Wednesday, facing calls that he take steps to quickly reverse Australia\u2019s rising greenhouse gas emissions, including moving away from coal. Pacific leaders are also urging Australia to drop its plan to use an accounting loophole to meet the emissions reduction pledge it made at the 2015 Paris climate conference. Enele Sopoaga, Tuvalu\u2019s prime minister, told the ABC that Australia\u2019s commitment to spend $500m from the existing aid budget for climate resilience and adaptation in the Pacific was a good gesture, but ultimately immoral if it was meant to stop countries talking about the need to cut emissions. Analysts say so-called \u201cKyoto credits\u201d that Australia wants to use to help meet its target do not represent additional emissions reductions or help meet the Paris goal of limiting global heating to as close to 1.5C as possible. Instead, they are a fudge that cuts what Australia needs to do to meet its 2030 emissions target roughly in half. The Australia Institute, a progressive thinktank, compared the scale of the loophole with the emissions released by other countries at the Pacific Islands Forum. The Morrison government says it will use Kyoto credits equivalent to 367m tonnes of carbon dioxide to help meet its 2030 target (a 26-28% reduction below 2005 levels). By comparison, the combined annual fossil fuel emissions from the other 16 forum members, including New Zealand, is about 45 million tonnes. Richie Merzian from the Australia Institute said Australia\u2019s plan was an insult to Pacific leaders and undermined the region\u2019s efforts to address the climate crisis. He said the institute\u2019s analysis illustrated why Morrison faced heavy criticism in the lead-up to the forum. He said other developed countries, including New Zealand, Britain and Germany, had ruled out using the credits. \u201cScott Morrison has a choice. Australia can be a leader in the region and a partner in combating the impact of climate change or we can continue to completely undermine any efforts by our Pacific partners by using these dodgy credits,\u201d he said. Unlike carbon credits created through offset projects such as tree planting, Kyoto credits do not represent an additional reduction in carbon dioxide. They have been created under the Kyoto protocol, which is set to expire next year. Under that agreement, developed countries set their own targets. For Australia, that was an 8% increase in emissions between 1990 and 2012, and then a 5% cut compared with 2000 levels by 2020. These targets have been criticised as being not up to what scientists say Australia needs to do to play its part in addressing the climate problem. The government says Australia did better than its first-stage Kyoto target and is on track to beat its low 2020 target. Under the rules of the Kyoto protocol, it can choose to claim credits equivalent to the amount of emissions by which it beat its target. But analysts say the idea behind Kyoto credits was to encourage countries to set ambitious targets and strive to beat them. In reality, they have been used to help countries do less. They say Australia has access to the credits only because it set what have been widely described as unambitious targets. Merzian said other OECD-member countries had ruled out using Kyoto credits to meet targets under the new Paris agreement, which officially begins in 2021.

This holiday club on the sprawling Lawrence Weston estate is being supplied with free lunches as part of a charity-funded push to help low-income families cope with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jul/25/holiday-hunger-shame-government-childrens-clubs\" title=\"\">extra costs of feeding children</a> over the six-week school break.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/aug/03/they-hadnt-eaten-all-day-food-banks-tackle-holiday-hunger\">'They hadn\u2019t eaten all day': food banks tackle holiday hunger</a> </p> </aside>  <p>NHS healthcare assistant Sandra Thomas watches two of her four children, who have just finished a two-hour archery and gymnastics session, tuck into their lunch. She has been to almost all the free activities on the estate so far this summer and is grateful food is provided. \u201cI would struggle by the end of week if I had to buy their lunches. Sometimes we can\u2019t afford to get bread \u2013 we\u2019ve really got to budget over the holidays,\u201d she says. \u201cIt is quite stressful.\u201d Thomas, 40, works weekends while her husband, who is a construction engineer, works Monday to Friday. \u201cThe kids are not on free school meals because me and my husband work, but financially we do struggle,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Jane Watson, 45, whose two children are entitled to free school meals, also finds it hard over the school holidays. \u201cObviously, you are spending more money. They are like, \u2018can you buy this, can you buy that\u2019 in the shops,\u201d she says, as her nine-year-old daughter and 12-year-old son delve into their bags. \u201cThis helps make ends meet. It\u2019s not so bad for me because my husband works, but there are a lot of one-parent families that struggle.\u201d</p> <p>None of this surprises community worker Donna Sealey. She regularly gives leftover lunches to desperate families at the end of sessions. \u201cWe see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/aug/03/they-hadnt-eaten-all-day-food-banks-tackle-holiday-hunger\" title=\"\">really hungry kids</a>. Yesterday the lunch was delayed and kids were complaining because they had not had any breakfast. The kids are also eating more than one lunch \u2013 typically a quarter of them will ask if we have anything else,\u201d she says. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a third world country, nobody should be living like this.\u201d</p> <p>Across the whole city, <a href=\"https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/11000-children-going-hungry-bristol-2885566\" title=\"\">nearly 11,000 children</a> on free school meals during term time are thought to be at risk of holiday hunger, according to local charity <a href=\"https://feedingbritain.org/what-we-do/where-we-work/bristol/\" title=\"\">Feeding Bristol</a>. And it is a problem that appears to be getting worse. North Bristol\u2019s five <a href=\"https://www.trusselltrust.org/get-help/find-a-foodbank/northbristol/\" title=\"\">Trussell Trust food banks</a> have seen a steep rise in the number of children they supply with emergency food over the summer, from 68 children in the first three weeks of the school holidays last year to 118 children in the same period this year \u2013 an increase of 73%.</p> <p>Yet Bristol is just one of many areas denied central government funding for holiday schemes to provide free meals to some of the country\u2019s most deprived children. Under pressure from charities and MPs concerned about rising numbers of parents using food banks outside of term time, the government announced last year it would fund a series of pilot projects through its <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/free-meals-and-activities-for-50000-children-over-2019-summer-holidays\" title=\"\">holiday activities and food programme</a> to ensure disadvantaged children receive a healthy diet during school holidays.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f2e2bb6a75dbedaec621161e8dcf720736aaf571\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f2e2bb6a75dbedaec621161e8dcf720736aaf571/0_428_8130_4880/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Free summer activities and lunches at the Ambition Lawrence Weston community centre, Bristol.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Free summer activities and lunches at the Ambition Lawrence Weston community centre, Bristol.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the majority of funding bids from the most deprived areas in England were rejected, according to data obtained under the Freedom of Information Act by the Guardian and Channel 4 News. The findings show that 88% of bids \u2013 81 projects covering 64 English local authority areas \u2013 were unsuccessful, despite the fact that just under one-third of rejected bids were in areas with the highest rates of child poverty,<strong> </strong>including<strong> </strong>Tower Hamlets \u2013 where 33.6% of pupils are on free school meals, more than anywhere else in England \u2013 Hackney and Blackpool, where, respectively, 27.7% and 25.5% of pupils are on free school meals. Overall, there are nearly 500,000 children at risk of holiday hunger this summer across the rejected local authority areas, the findings show.</p> <p>The figures underline the sharp <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/feb/20/british-children-living-in-poverty-could-hit-record-high-report\" title=\"\">growth in child poverty</a>: the latest analysis shows that 4.1 million children are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/mar/28/poverty-increases-among-children-and-pensioners-across-uk\" title=\"\">living below the breadline</a>.</p> <p>Yet prevalence of child poverty doesn\u2019t seem to have influenced the government\u2019s funding decisions for food programmes. Of the 11 successful bids, four were in areas with relatively small proportions of children on free school meals: bids from Hampshire and Leicestershire were successful even though they fall within the lowest quartile of pupils on free school meals in England.</p> <p>The mayor of Tower Hamlets, John Biggs, says the London borough has had to scale back its plans for the summer. \u201cThe funding would have allowed us to have a pretty comprehensive arrangement, giving kids a healthy breakfast and healthy lunch,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are putting on some clubs ourselves. But it is pretty meagre compared to the resources we would have had \u2013 we are spending in the region of \u00a390,000 rather than the \u00a31.2m we were looking for.\u201d</p> <p>He adds it\u2019s hard to understand why an area where more than half of children grow up in poverty has been passed over. \u201cWe have the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/may/15/child-poverty-above-50-per-cent-in-10-uk-constituencies\" title=\"\">highest rate of child poverty</a> of any local authority in the country,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is outrageous that the bid was rejected.\u201d</p> <p>In Blackpool, the council has only been able to find just under \u00a3120,000 for its own holiday hunger clubs. Kathryn Benson, cabinet member for schools, says the decision was disappointing as it is the most deprived council in the country. \u201cThe long summer break can hit families particularly hard as they need to budget for two additional meals a day alongside the additional expense of keeping their children entertained,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Hackney\u2019s \u00a3500,000 bid would have fed 2,700 children across the borough. Instead, the council is relying on an unfunded charity which distributes surplus donations from supermarkets to four youth centres. \u201cWe are doing everything we can to support our most vulnerable families. But we know that more needs to be done. That is why it is particularly disappointing that central government has failed to provide this vital funding for Hackney, at a time when our residents and families need it most,\u201d says Chris Kennedy, the borough\u2019s cabinet member for families.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ef698730b05b99806aaa1385ae5347af8f2afe77\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ef698730b05b99806aaa1385ae5347af8f2afe77/0_0_3500_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The mayor of Tower Hamlets, John Biggs\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The mayor of Tower Hamlets, John Biggs (above), says the London borough has had to scale back its plans to provide free meals this summer.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hannah McKay/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Manchester, which also lost out, has managed to fund some free meals at holiday clubs. Luthfur Rahman, cabinet member for culture and leisure, says holiday hunger is a <a href=\"https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/1500-hungry-children-week-being-15079247\" title=\"\">growing problem</a> in the city. \u201cMany organisations have come together in Manchester, including the voluntary sector and schools to fill the gap,\u201d he says. \u201cHowever, this is a sticking plaster at best.\u201d</p> <p>Even among the successful councils that have been able to expand their holiday provision to reach more children at risk, some feel the government\u2019s programme does not get to the root of the problem. The deputy leader of Gateshead council, Catherine Donovan, says: \u201cIf the government is really serious about tackling this issue and looking after the children of Gateshead, they should give parents the dignity of secure work and a benefits system that truly supports those in need.\u201d</p> <p>The Department for Education says this year\u2019s pilot will inform the government approach: \u201cThis year we invested \u00a39m in summer holiday clubs, providing activities and hot meals for disadvantaged children. This pilot will help show how we coordinate free provision in different areas, and help us decide how best to intervene in the future.\u201d</p> <p>But the children\u2019s commissioner for England, Anne Longfield, says this isn\u2019t quick enough and wants all schools in poor areas to provide activities and nourishing food over the holidays. \u201cThis issue is not new, and while we understand that the government needs to find the best ways of delivering with public funds, they are late tackling this issue. The human cost of just running pilots in a small number of areas to \u2018work out what works best\u2019 is, sadly, too many other children going hungry,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Back in Bristol, Feeding Bristol has had to drastically cut back the 100,000 meals it was planning to deliver. \u201cWe have the highest number of children claiming free school meals in the south-west,\u201d says Andy Street, Feeding Bristol chair. \u201cIf we had got the funding, there is no question we would have fed significantly more children. There are a good number of children we are not able to help this year.\u201d</p> <p>The charity had to organise a last-ditch appeal in May. It managed to raise \u00a3125,000 and with the help of 450 unpaid volunteers is delivering 55,000 meals to existing clubs in Bristol.

      "bodyText": "Thirteen children gather eagerly around a pile of brown paper bags crammed with sandwiches, yoghurts and fruit in a youth centre on the deprived north-west fringes of Bristol. This holiday club on the sprawling Lawrence Weston estate is being supplied with free lunches as part of a charity-funded push to help low-income families cope with the extra costs of feeding children over the six-week school break. NHS healthcare assistant Sandra Thomas watches two of her four children, who have just finished a two-hour archery and gymnastics session, tuck into their lunch. She has been to almost all the free activities on the estate so far this summer and is grateful food is provided. \u201cI would struggle by the end of week if I had to buy their lunches. Sometimes we can\u2019t afford to get bread \u2013 we\u2019ve really got to budget over the holidays,\u201d she says. \u201cIt is quite stressful.\u201d Thomas, 40, works weekends while her husband, who is a construction engineer, works Monday to Friday. \u201cThe kids are not on free school meals because me and my husband work, but financially we do struggle,\u201d she says. Jane Watson, 45, whose two children are entitled to free school meals, also finds it hard over the school holidays. \u201cObviously, you are spending more money. They are like, \u2018can you buy this, can you buy that\u2019 in the shops,\u201d she says, as her nine-year-old daughter and 12-year-old son delve into their bags. \u201cThis helps make ends meet. It\u2019s not so bad for me because my husband works, but there are a lot of one-parent families that struggle.\u201d None of this surprises community worker Donna Sealey. She regularly gives leftover lunches to desperate families at the end of sessions. \u201cWe see really hungry kids. Yesterday the lunch was delayed and kids were complaining because they had not had any breakfast. The kids are also eating more than one lunch \u2013 typically a quarter of them will ask if we have anything else,\u201d she says. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a third world country, nobody should be living like this.\u201d Across the whole city, nearly 11,000 children on free school meals during term time are thought to be at risk of holiday hunger, according to local charity Feeding Bristol. And it is a problem that appears to be getting worse. North Bristol\u2019s five Trussell Trust food banks have seen a steep rise in the number of children they supply with emergency food over the summer, from 68 children in the first three weeks of the school holidays last year to 118 children in the same period this year \u2013 an increase of 73%. Yet Bristol is just one of many areas denied central government funding for holiday schemes to provide free meals to some of the country\u2019s most deprived children. Under pressure from charities and MPs concerned about rising numbers of parents using food banks outside of term time, the government announced last year it would fund a series of pilot projects through its holiday activities and food programme to ensure disadvantaged children receive a healthy diet during school holidays. But the majority of funding bids from the most deprived areas in England were rejected, according to data obtained under the Freedom of Information Act by the Guardian and Channel 4 News. The findings show that 88% of bids \u2013 81 projects covering 64 English local authority areas \u2013 were unsuccessful, despite the fact that just under one-third of rejected bids were in areas with the highest rates of child poverty, including Tower Hamlets \u2013 where 33.6% of pupils are on free school meals, more than anywhere else in England \u2013 Hackney and Blackpool, where, respectively, 27.7% and 25.5% of pupils are on free school meals. Overall, there are nearly 500,000 children at risk of holiday hunger this summer across the rejected local authority areas, the findings show. The figures underline the sharp growth in child poverty: the latest analysis shows that 4.1 million children are living below the breadline. Yet prevalence of child poverty doesn\u2019t seem to have influenced the government\u2019s funding decisions for food programmes. Of the 11 successful bids, four were in areas with relatively small proportions of children on free school meals: bids from Hampshire and Leicestershire were successful even though they fall within the lowest quartile of pupils on free school meals in England. The mayor of Tower Hamlets, John Biggs, says the London borough has had to scale back its plans for the summer. \u201cThe funding would have allowed us to have a pretty comprehensive arrangement, giving kids a healthy breakfast and healthy lunch,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are putting on some clubs ourselves. But it is pretty meagre compared to the resources we would have had \u2013 we are spending in the region of \u00a390,000 rather than the \u00a31.2m we were looking for.\u201d He adds it\u2019s hard to understand why an area where more than half of children grow up in poverty has been passed over. \u201cWe have the highest rate of child poverty of any local authority in the country,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is outrageous that the bid was rejected.\u201d In Blackpool, the council has only been able to find just under \u00a3120,000 for its own holiday hunger clubs. Kathryn Benson, cabinet member for schools, says the decision was disappointing as it is the most deprived council in the country. \u201cThe long summer break can hit families particularly hard as they need to budget for two additional meals a day alongside the additional expense of keeping their children entertained,\u201d she says. Hackney\u2019s \u00a3500,000 bid would have fed 2,700 children across the borough. Instead, the council is relying on an unfunded charity which distributes surplus donations from supermarkets to four youth centres. \u201cWe are doing everything we can to support our most vulnerable families. But we know that more needs to be done. That is why it is particularly disappointing that central government has failed to provide this vital funding for Hackney, at a time when our residents and families need it most,\u201d says Chris Kennedy, the borough\u2019s cabinet member for families. Manchester, which also lost out, has managed to fund some free meals at holiday clubs. Luthfur Rahman, cabinet member for culture and leisure, says holiday hunger is a growing problem in the city. \u201cMany organisations have come together in Manchester, including the voluntary sector and schools to fill the gap,\u201d he says. \u201cHowever, this is a sticking plaster at best.\u201d Even among the successful councils that have been able to expand their holiday provision to reach more children at risk, some feel the government\u2019s programme does not get to the root of the problem. The deputy leader of Gateshead council, Catherine Donovan, says: \u201cIf the government is really serious about tackling this issue and looking after the children of Gateshead, they should give parents the dignity of secure work and a benefits system that truly supports those in need.\u201d The Department for Education says this year\u2019s pilot will inform the government approach: \u201cThis year we invested \u00a39m in summer holiday clubs, providing activities and hot meals for disadvantaged children. This pilot will help show how we coordinate free provision in different areas, and help us decide how best to intervene in the future.\u201d But the children\u2019s commissioner for England, Anne Longfield, says this isn\u2019t quick enough and wants all schools in poor areas to provide activities and nourishing food over the holidays. \u201cThis issue is not new, and while we understand that the government needs to find the best ways of delivering with public funds, they are late tackling this issue. The human cost of just running pilots in a small number of areas to \u2018work out what works best\u2019 is, sadly, too many other children going hungry,\u201d she says. Back in Bristol, Feeding Bristol has had to drastically cut back the 100,000 meals it was planning to deliver. \u201cWe have the highest number of children claiming free school meals in the south-west,\u201d says Andy Street, Feeding Bristol chair. \u201cIf we had got the funding, there is no question we would have fed significantly more children. There are a good number of children we are not able to help this year.\u201d The charity had to organise a last-ditch appeal in May. It managed to raise \u00a3125,000 and with the help of 450 unpaid volunteers is delivering 55,000 meals to existing clubs in Bristol. While Street is incredibly proud of the city\u2019s response, he admits relying on donations from businesses and volunteers\u2019 time is not a long-term solution. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t need to do this \u2013 we need to get to a place where every family has access to good-quality food,\u201d he says. Case study: \u2018If it wasn\u2019t for the food bank, these two would be eating pretty much nothing\u2019 Part-time school cook Katie Harris gently strokes the dark hair of her fidgeting two-year-old boy while she waits patiently with her nine-year-old daughter for an emergency food parcel in a church hall in Horfield, north Bristol. \u201cI mostly dread the school holidays coming around,\u201d she says, retrieving a sandal her son has launched across the room in frustration. \u201cThey get fed in school for free but when they are at home you have got to pay for everything.\u201d Harris earns around \u00a3500 a month from her job, working less than 16 hours a week in one of the city\u2019s private schools. But with a child typically costing an extra \u00a330-40 a week to feed over the holidays she has been forced to use her local food bank. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for this food bank these two would be eating pretty much nothing.

A nonconformist sermon, it begs us all to let some sort of transforming spectre \u2013 holy or not \u2013 enter our lesser selves, or we will not be saved. \u2022 Alan Warner\u2019s next novel, Kitchenly 434, will be published in 2020.

The application has been \u201cprovisionally approved\u201d although its bid to expand the site is \u201cunder consideration\u201d. The proposed site is close to the Gorokan high school, a bus interchange, library, a community skate park, the Gravity Youth Centre, mental health service Headspace, Centrelink and public housing. It\u2019s also in an alcohol-free council zone. Foundation for Alcohol Research and Education chief executive Michael Thorn said Lake Haven is not an isolated case but part of a wider national trend of disadvantaged areas being targeted by Woolworths. \u201cThey\u2019ve been doing this for nearly a decade. They fight to the bitter end using all their financial power to exhaust communities,\u201d Thorn said. In Darwin, a town beset with alcohol problems, opponents are fighting Woolworths\u2019 bid to build its first Dan Murphy\u2019s store in the Northern Territory, within walking distance of three Indigenous communities \u2013 Bagot, Minmarama and Kulaluk. Last year the Perth community of Maylands, which already had a problem with street drinking and alcohol-related crime, fought off a proposal for a Dan Murphy\u2019s liquor barn. In 2016, Woolworths won approval to build a Dan Murphy\u2019s store in the \u201cfamily violence hot spot\u201d at Cranbourne East in Melbourne, sparking calls for a rethink of the Victorian licensing process. The Central Coast Council has written a submission to the NSW Independent Liquor and Gaming Authority which argues establishing a Dan Murphy\u2019s on the Lake Haven site could undo local government efforts to clean up the area and make it more family friendly. \u201cWe\u2019ve done a lot in recent years to lift the tenor of the place, to make it feel a bit safer,\u201d a council insider said. The submission notes there were major issues with underage public drinking when the previous drive-through bottle shop was in business. Central Coast Local Health District has also made a submission opposing the proposal. Back in 2014, the Local Health District warned the authority not to grant approval for the BWS store because it was \u201clikely to contribute to further alcohol-related harm and negative health outcomes for the local community\u201d. The chief executive, Matt Hanrahan, cited data showing that in the local government area the rate of alcohol-linked hospital admissions were at 360 per 100,000 people, higher than the state average of 319. Police also objected to the 2014 BWS application and said \u201cthe race for liquor sales supremacy should not override public interest\u201d. \u201c[Lake Haven] area is a hotspot for antisocial behaviour with significant problems with youth in the area, often alcohol-related,\u201d police said in their submission. \u201cPolice submit that incidence of alcohol-related assaults, domestic assaults, theft, malicious damage to property, harassment and threatening behaviour in the Lake Haven area are well above the NSW state average.\u201d Woolworths argued in its 2014 application its proposed store was in an area of high population growth with strong tourist numbers and it would \u201ccannibalise\u201d sales at existing bottle shops rather than introduce new drinkers to the market. It rejected the concerns of police and health services. There\u2019s already a Coles Liquorland at the Lake Haven shopping centre. A rival liquor licence bid from Aldi at the same shopping centre in 2015 was also scuttled. The NSW Independent Liquor and Gaming Authority\u2019s 2014 BWS rejection decision said it considered there to be a \u201csubstantial negative social impact in this case\u201d. \u201cThe authority is not satisfied \u2026 that the overall social impact of granting this type of licence to a business located at this particular site will not be detrimental to this local community,\u201d the decision said. A 2015 study by Michael Livingston from La Trobe University Centre for Alcohol Policy Research, found that in Victoria there was a higher density of packaged liquor outlets in disadvantaged neighbourhoods. \u201cFor whatever reason, whether it\u2019s predatory behaviour, whether it\u2019s cheap rents, that\u2019s where bottle shops ended up being concentrated. There are similar studies in the US and similar evidence around fast food,\u201d Livingston said. \u201cIt seems like a broader trend that these kinds of outlets with negative health consequences tend to cluster in areas where there are already health problems.\u201d Woolworths announced in July it was combining its pubs, liquor and gambling arms into a separate venture called Endeavour Drinks which it would offload. Endeavour Drinks spokesman Shane Tremble denied the company deliberately targeted poorer communities. He said it took its responsibilities as a drinks retailer seriously and implemented many responsible service-of-alcohol measures that went above and beyond regulatory requirements. \u201cWe believe the best way to manage the risk of alcohol-related harm is by rigid adherence to responsible service practices, the training of team members, the range of products sold, and the capacity for retailers to actively engage with the local community on any issues as they arise,\u201d Tremble said. The NSW Independent Liquor and Gaming Authority said it had carried out community consultation and there had been three submissions opposing the store. The authority said it would also consider issues such as risks of alcohol-related harm and health and community amenity impacts as well as a detailed demographic report, NSW crime and health statistics and Australian Bureau of Statistics socioeconomic data.",

There\u2019s a circular touchpad on each bud for controls \u2013 single, double and triple taps can take care of playback, change the noise reduction mode or activate Google Assistant. Which side does what can be configured in an Android or iOS app.</p> <p>Tapping and holding the left bud activates ambient listening mode, reducing the volume and noise reduction, which is useful for catching public transport announcements. Talking to people using ambient mode is possible too, but I wouldn\u2019t recommend it because people will think you\u2019re being incredibly rude.</p> <p>Taking out one of the buds pauses the music. Popping it back in starts it again. All the controls work very well, but they\u2019re missing the big one: volume. You\u2019ve got to dig out your phone to change the volume, which is a real shame.</p> <h2>Case and fit</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"49b3e3d4b58a6bca150249b6093ae846000822f3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/49b3e3d4b58a6bca150249b6093ae846000822f3/464_501_3913_2349/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sony WF-1000XM3 review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The top of the charging case is coloured rose gold or copper.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The attractive flip-top charging case is too big to really pocket, which means it\u2019ll have to go in a bag. It charges in 3.5 hours via USB-C and will charge the earbuds three times. A 10-minute stay in the case charges the earbuds for about 90 minutes of playback time, while a full charge takes 90 minutes.</p> <p>You\u2019ll get between five and six hours of constant playback with noise cancelling on, or eight with it off, for a total of 22 to 32 hours, using the case.</p> <p>Sony ditched the ear hook from its previous true wireless earbuds in favour of a new \u201chigh-friction rubber surface\u201d on the outer part that enters your ear.</p> <p>With the correct earbud tip, chosen from the seven pairs included, the fit is pretty secure, despite the size and 8.5g weight, which is on the heavy side for wireless earbuds. I would not recommend them for running, though \u2013 they are not water resistant. Generally, they are fairly comfortable in the ear, but I found if I didn\u2019t quite get the right orientation the outer rubber surface caused pain in the fleshy bits of my ear after about 45 minutes.</p> <h2>Noise cancelling and sound</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0f550851dd3cf26125d1069bd04b756446c825c4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f550851dd3cf26125d1069bd04b756446c825c4/629_520_3680_2209/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sony WF-1000XM3 review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The outer surface has a microphone hole next to a circular touchpad for controlling music or switching noise cancelling modes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Sony WF-1000XM3 are the most effective in-ear noise cancelling earphones I have tried, including those with wires and large batteries. Noise across the board is effectively reduced, including train noise, road noise and engine rumble, meaning you can listen to your music, and hear it clearly, at lower volumes.</p> <p>The earbuds are heavily affected by wind noise, however, which appears to be a function of their size and how much they stick out of your ears. The wind noise reduction setting appears to do very little.</p> <p>An ambient sound mode pipes noise in from the outside world, which is good for awareness. There\u2019s an adaptive sound mode too that adjusts the noise cancelling depending on what you\u2019re doing. I found simply leaving the noise cancelling set to maximum to be best.</p> <p>The best thing about the WF-1000XM3 is how they sound. We\u2019re not short of great-sounding, expensive, true wireless earbuds. The Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless were the best, but no longer. Sony\u2019s finally cracked it on sound.</p> <p>The WF-1000XM3 produce the sort of sparkling audio that allows you to hear new things in longtime favourite tracks. With great energy and clarity, crisp highs, balanced treble and punchy bass, the earbuds sound brilliant out of the box. Sony\u2019s DSEE HX system also works well at bringing life back to highly compressed tracks, but you can also tweak the equaliser manually or use one of the many presets, such as the classic Bass Boost.</p> <h2>Connectivity</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"baead13d777037f9630d57740d51790dab071e21\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/baead13d777037f9630d57740d51790dab071e21/661_801_3567_2141/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sony WF-1000XM3 review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A sensor in the earbuds detects the proximity of your ear to tell when you\u2019re wearing them.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The new earbuds only support SBC and AAC Bluetooth audio formats, not the higher-quality aptX or Sony\u2019s own LDAC. But they do support Bluetooth 5.0, with each bud making a connection directly to the phone rather than piggybacking off one another. The result is a rock-solid connection, even in challenging conditions, and reduced latency. Even with the oft-problematic YouTube app, I couldn\u2019t spot any lip-sync issues where the sound and the video appear out of time, and only mild lag with games.</p> <p>You can only have one device connected at a time, and switching between them requires manually disconnecting from one device before connecting to the other, which is a bit of a pain.</p> <h2>Observations</h2> <ul> <li><p>The voice announcements (telling you what you\u2019ve just changed) delay any mode changes until the full announcement has finished, which can be tediously slow.

Terrible name, excellent set of earbuds. Packing genuinely impressive noise cancelling technology, brilliant sound, rock-solid connectivity and even long battery life into wireless earbuds is something of an achievement.</p> <p>All that technology makes the earbuds massive, which causes people to stare at you occasionally \u2013 if you want something discreet, these are not it. It can be difficult to get the right fit too, and the case, while attractive, is too large to comfortably fit in a pocket. They also lack a volume control on the earbuds, which is mildly annoying.</p> <p>While a price of \u00a3220 doesn\u2019t sound cheap, the WF-1000XM3 actually undercut the best-sounding competition by \u00a360-80.</p> <p>They\u2019re not for everyone, but the Sony WF-1000XM3 are the best-sounding, most feature-packed true wireless earbuds you can buy right now.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Brilliant sound, effective noise cancelling, long battery life, solid connectivity, good customisation options, full EQ, attractive design, Google Assistant</p> <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Big earbuds, expensive, big case, problem with wind noise, no onboard volume control</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f7b51b918858f62bc05ff4b85c7b0187e4ce491f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f7b51b918858f62bc05ff4b85c7b0187e4ce491f/474_530_3970_2383/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sony WF-1000XM3 review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The earbuds aren\u2019t small, but hide their size by being more visually balanced in the ear.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Other reviews</h2> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/may/01/best-true-wireless-earbuds-airpods-samsung-jabra-sennheiser-anker-compared-and-ranked\">Best true wireless earbuds 2019: AirPods, Samsung, Jabra and Anker compared and ranked</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p><br></p>",

Which side does what can be configured in an Android or iOS app. Tapping and holding the left bud activates ambient listening mode, reducing the volume and noise reduction, which is useful for catching public transport announcements. Talking to people using ambient mode is possible too, but I wouldn\u2019t recommend it because people will think you\u2019re being incredibly rude. Taking out one of the buds pauses the music. Popping it back in starts it again. All the controls work very well, but they\u2019re missing the big one: volume. You\u2019ve got to dig out your phone to change the volume, which is a real shame. Case and fit The attractive flip-top charging case is too big to really pocket, which means it\u2019ll have to go in a bag. It charges in 3.5 hours via USB-C and will charge the earbuds three times. A 10-minute stay in the case charges the earbuds for about 90 minutes of playback time, while a full charge takes 90 minutes. You\u2019ll get between five and six hours of constant playback with noise cancelling on, or eight with it off, for a total of 22 to 32 hours, using the case. Sony ditched the ear hook from its previous true wireless earbuds in favour of a new \u201chigh-friction rubber surface\u201d on the outer part that enters your ear. With the correct earbud tip, chosen from the seven pairs included, the fit is pretty secure, despite the size and 8.5g weight, which is on the heavy side for wireless earbuds. I would not recommend them for running, though \u2013 they are not water resistant. Generally, they are fairly comfortable in the ear, but I found if I didn\u2019t quite get the right orientation the outer rubber surface caused pain in the fleshy bits of my ear after about 45 minutes. Noise cancelling and sound The Sony WF-1000XM3 are the most effective in-ear noise cancelling earphones I have tried, including those with wires and large batteries. Noise across the board is effectively reduced, including train noise, road noise and engine rumble, meaning you can listen to your music, and hear it clearly, at lower volumes. The earbuds are heavily affected by wind noise, however, which appears to be a function of their size and how much they stick out of your ears. The wind noise reduction setting appears to do very little. An ambient sound mode pipes noise in from the outside world, which is good for awareness. There\u2019s an adaptive sound mode too that adjusts the noise cancelling depending on what you\u2019re doing. I found simply leaving the noise cancelling set to maximum to be best. The best thing about the WF-1000XM3 is how they sound. We\u2019re not short of great-sounding, expensive, true wireless earbuds. The Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless were the best, but no longer. Sony\u2019s finally cracked it on sound. The WF-1000XM3 produce the sort of sparkling audio that allows you to hear new things in longtime favourite tracks. With great energy and clarity, crisp highs, balanced treble and punchy bass, the earbuds sound brilliant out of the box. Sony\u2019s DSEE HX system also works well at bringing life back to highly compressed tracks, but you can also tweak the equaliser manually or use one of the many presets, such as the classic Bass Boost. Connectivity The new earbuds only support SBC and AAC Bluetooth audio formats, not the higher-quality aptX or Sony\u2019s own LDAC. But they do support Bluetooth 5.0, with each bud making a connection directly to the phone rather than piggybacking off one another. The result is a rock-solid connection, even in challenging conditions, and reduced latency. Even with the oft-problematic YouTube app, I couldn\u2019t spot any lip-sync issues where the sound and the video appear out of time, and only mild lag with games. You can only have one device connected at a time, and switching between them requires manually disconnecting from one device before connecting to the other, which is a bit of a pain. Observations The voice announcements (telling you what you\u2019ve just changed) delay any mode changes until the full announcement has finished, which can be tediously slow. Turning off voice announcements solved the problem. Google Assistant is built in, for reading notifications and more advanced functions, or you can simply use the standard Google Assistant or Siri functions on your phone. An NFC spot on the case provides one-tap pairing. It\u2019s difficult to tell how much charge is left in the case. Call quality was great, with minimal background noise, but became muffled and distant in louder environments. Price The Sony WF-1000XM3 cost \u00a3220 and are available in black or silver. For comparison, the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless cost \u00a3280, the B&amp;O E8 2.0 cost \u00a3300 and the Master &amp; Dynamic MW07 cost \u00a3279. Verdict Sony\u2019s hit a home run with the WF-1000XM3. Terrible name, excellent set of earbuds. Packing genuinely impressive noise cancelling technology, brilliant sound, rock-solid connectivity and even long battery life into wireless earbuds is something of an achievement. All that technology makes the earbuds massive, which causes people to stare at you occasionally \u2013 if you want something discreet, these are not it. It can be difficult to get the right fit too, and the case, while attractive, is too large to comfortably fit in a pocket. They also lack a volume control on the earbuds, which is mildly annoying. While a price of \u00a3220 doesn\u2019t sound cheap, the WF-1000XM3 actually undercut the best-sounding competition by \u00a360-80. They\u2019re not for everyone, but the Sony WF-1000XM3 are the best-sounding, most feature-packed true wireless earbuds you can buy right now. Pros: Brilliant sound, effective noise cancelling, long battery life, solid connectivity, good customisation options, full EQ, attractive design, Google Assistant Cons: Big earbuds, expensive, big case, problem with wind noise, no onboard volume control Other reviews Best true wireless earbuds 2019: AirPods, Samsung, Jabra and Anker compared and ranked",

My grandparents were founding partners of the Icelandic glacial research society. When my grandfather said he wanted to take my grandmother with him on a three-week research trip in 1955, some men asked him if he was crazy. Take a woman on a glacier trip? My grandparents and the research team mapped and measured the glacier and were stuck in a small tent for three days. \u201cWeren\u2019t you cold?\u201d I asked them. \u201cCold? We were just married,\u201d they replied. The part of the glacier where they pitched their tent had no name at the time. Today it is called Br\u00fa\u00f0arbunga, \u201cThe Bride\u2019s Bulge\u201d.</p> <p>For now, <a href=\"https://earthice.hi.is/glaciers_iceland\" title=\"\">about 10% of Iceland</a> is covered with glaciers. The thickest packs are in Vatnaj\u00f6kull \u2013 up to 1,000 metres deep. Imagine stacking three Empire State Buildings on top of each other \u2013 then stretch that bulk over the horizon. To think that something so huge is actually fragile is beyond comprehension. When my grandparents measured the glaciers, they were the eternal white giants. But calculate how long they will last in this warming climate and the outlook is bleak, to say the least. Most of them will only last the lifespan of someone born today who lives to a good age. We understand that glaciers grow and recede, but this is a collapse, an explosion in slow motion.</p> <p>It\u2019s not that we aren\u2019t used to changes in nature: we have mountains in Iceland younger than myself, huge craters that are younger than the Brooklyn Bridge. We have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/nov/17/iceland-volcano-eruption-geology-geoscience\" title=\"\">volcanic eruptions</a> so violent and powerful that they seem to render all human action puny by comparison.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"12615973ec638c2e5dace6d50bd9cb28a7a0f035\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/12615973ec638c2e5dace6d50bd9cb28a7a0f035/0_29_850_510/500.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018My grandparents were founding partners of the Icelandic glacial research society; they went on a research trip together in 1955.\u2019\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018My grandparents were founding partners of the Icelandic glacial research society; they went on a research trip together in 1955.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andri Sn\u00e6r Magnason</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What do we humans matter, people ask, when a volcano might blow and spew out millions of tonnes of CO2?

But its CO2 emissions were only about 150,000 tonnes a day, compared with human activity which is responsible for almost 100m tonnes a day. The impact of humans on a daily basis is equal to more than 600 of these volcanoes. Imagine all these eruptions on every continent, all day, all night, all year round and tell yourself that they have no effect on the climate.</p> <p>The natural world is being transformed at an alarming rate.

A dying glacier is not a dramatic event. The drama of a melting glacier is no more dramatic than springtime: one day there is snow and the next day it is gone. We are living through the Great Thaw, the Big Melt. We have to remind ourselves that this is not normal. That it is not OK to write a memorial to a glacier named Ok. We remind ourselves with a plaque that we resemble the frogs which are <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_frog\" title=\"\">slowly boiled alive</a> in the fable. Fellow frogs, we are cooking: what are we going to do about it?</p> <p>One of the fundamental flaws of our civilisation is its inability to think outside the present. When a scientist talks about 2100, we feel the date has nothing to do with us. So sometimes when I talk to university students I ask them to do a simple calculation, a thought experiment. I tell them, if you were born in the year 2000 you might become a healthy 90-year-old. At that time you might have a favourite 20-year-old in your life. A grandchild perhaps, someone you have known and loved for 20 years. When will that person be a healthy 90-year-old, maybe talking about you as the greatest influence in their lives?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/19/himalayan-glacier-melting-doubled-since-2000-scientists-reveal\">Himalayan glacier melting doubled since 2000, spy satellites show</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The students do the maths and come up with a year like 2160. That is not an abstract calculation. That is the intimate time of someone in high school or at university today. This is time whose meaning they can touch with their bare hands. If we can connect deeply to a date like this, what do we think of scientists warning of catastrophe in 2070? Or 2090? How can that be beyond our imagination, as if part of some sci-fi future?</p> <p>So on the copper plate to commemorate Ok glacier, we have written to these loved ones of the future: \u201cWe know what is happening and what needs to be done. Only you know if we did it.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Andri Sn\u00e6r Magnason is the Icelandic author of LoveStar, The Casket of Time and The Story of the Blue Planet</p>",

When academics at Rice University in Houston, Texas called and asked me to write the text for a plaque to commemorate the first dead glacier in Iceland, I found myself confronted with this problem. I was reminded of one of my favourite passages from Kurt Vonnegut in Slaughterhouse-Five: \u201cYou know what I say to people when I hear they\u2019re writing anti-war books?\u201d \u201cNo. What do you say, Harrison Starr?\u201d \u201cI say, \u2018Why don\u2019t you write an anti-glacier book instead?\u2019\u201d What he meant, of course, was that there would always be wars, that they were as easy to stop as glaciers.

In the spirit of Vonnegut, you could say that the Texan professors had asked me to write a pro-glacier text. The name of our dead glacier has multiple layers. Ok in Icelandic is the equivalent of \u201cyoke\u201d in English, the pole traditionally used to carry buckets of water. Yoke can also mean burden, something that weighs you down.

We were just married,\u201d they replied. The part of the glacier where they pitched their tent had no name at the time. Today it is called Br\u00fa\u00f0arbunga, \u201cThe Bride\u2019s Bulge\u201d. For now, about 10% of Iceland is covered with glaciers. The thickest packs are in Vatnaj\u00f6kull \u2013 up to 1,000 metres deep. Imagine stacking three Empire State Buildings on top of each other \u2013 then stretch that bulk over the horizon. To think that something so huge is actually fragile is beyond comprehension. When my grandparents measured the glaciers, they were the eternal white giants. But calculate how long they will last in this warming climate and the outlook is bleak, to say the least. Most of them will only last the lifespan of someone born today who lives to a good age. We understand that glaciers grow and recede, but this is a collapse, an explosion in slow motion. It\u2019s not that we aren\u2019t used to changes in nature: we have mountains in Iceland younger than myself, huge craters that are younger than the Brooklyn Bridge. We have volcanic eruptions so violent and powerful that they seem to render all human action puny by comparison. What do we humans matter, people ask, when a volcano might blow and spew out millions of tonnes of CO2? In 2010 the famous Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull eruption closed down all airports in Europe. But its CO2 emissions were only about 150,000 tonnes a day, compared with human activity which is responsible for almost 100m tonnes a day. The impact of humans on a daily basis is equal to more than 600 of these volcanoes. Imagine all these eruptions on every continent, all day, all night, all year round and tell yourself that they have no effect on the climate. The natural world is being transformed at an alarming rate. The frozen graves of mammoths in Siberia are thawing and the rate of ocean acidification is reaching levels not seen for 50m years. A dying glacier is not a dramatic event. The drama of a melting glacier is no more dramatic than springtime: one day there is snow and the next day it is gone. We are living through the Great Thaw, the Big Melt. We have to remind ourselves that this is not normal. That it is not OK to write a memorial to a glacier named Ok. We remind ourselves with a plaque that we resemble the frogs which are slowly boiled alive in the fable. Fellow frogs, we are cooking: what are we going to do about it? One of the fundamental flaws of our civilisation is its inability to think outside the present. When a scientist talks about 2100, we feel the date has nothing to do with us. So sometimes when I talk to university students I ask them to do a simple calculation, a thought experiment. I tell them, if you were born in the year 2000 you might become a healthy 90-year-old. At that time you might have a favourite 20-year-old in your life. A grandchild perhaps, someone you have known and loved for 20 years. When will that person be a healthy 90-year-old, maybe talking about you as the greatest influence in their lives? The students do the maths and come up with a year like 2160. That is not an abstract calculation. That is the intimate time of someone in high school or at university today. This is time whose meaning they can touch with their bare hands. If we can connect deeply to a date like this, what do we think of scientists warning of catastrophe in 2070? Or 2090? How can that be beyond our imagination, as if part of some sci-fi future? So on the copper plate to commemorate Ok glacier, we have written to these loved ones of the future: \u201cWe know what is happening and what needs to be done. Only you know if we did it.\u201d \u2022 Andri Sn\u00e6r Magnason is the Icelandic author of LoveStar, The Casket of Time and The Story of the Blue Planet",

In this poor, rural corner of the American south, the process of getting an abortion is logistically difficult, emotionally fraught and often a battle against poverty.</p> <p>It is also getting harder. A wave of anti-abortion bills have spread across the US, especially parts of the conservative south.

      "bodyText": "For the third time in a week, LT stood at the reception in the abortion clinic in Shreveport, Louisiana, more than 90 minutes away from her home. She was \u2013 again \u2013 looking for the right paperwork to show her boss why she had taken time off work from her busy job at a chain restaurant in north-eastern Louisiana. LT had first showed him a $550 receipt from the clinic. No, he told the 22-year-old single mother, he wanted a doctor\u2019s note from the clinic. So \u2013 using the last $25 she had in her bank account \u2013 she drove back because, without it, her manager refused to put her back on the schedule. And LT could not afford to miss any shifts. Many women did not want to be identified because only a handful of people knew of their situation. They also worried about stigma in their small, southern communities. But LT\u2019s is a common story and not close to one of the worst. In this poor, rural corner of the American south, the process of getting an abortion is logistically difficult, emotionally fraught and often a battle against poverty. It is also getting harder. A wave of anti-abortion bills have spread across the US, especially parts of the conservative south. The aim is to make abortion more difficult, with more paperwork, bureaucracy and early deadlines and, perhaps, one day outlaw it. That would force already poor women to travel even longer distances to get abortions and spend even more money \u2013 or have them take risks for illegal procedures. Kathaleen Pittman, director of the Hope Medical Group for Women, said more than 80% of the women who come in to her Shreveport clinic self-identify as living below the poverty line. Last week, a counselor at Hope met a woman who drove from New Orleans because the clinic there charged twice as much. A not-for-profit had given her $500 towards the procedure. The woman, who lives in her car and showers at the gym with her $10 membership, knew it wasn\u2019t enough. She called Hope, who gave her the remaining funds, and with those in hand, barely made her appointment before the 16-week cutoff . The procedure itself equalled two months of LT\u2019s rent for the four-bedroom trailer she lives in with her sister. Her partner paid for half of it. She\u2019s behind in bills by more than $2,500. Her tuition at a community college is $2,000 a semester for her associate degree in Biological Sciences. Her bank account is negative. She has a four-year-old to feed and keep in childcare. This is life on the financial edge and an abortion can push someone over it. But it\u2019s far less than the cost of an unwanted pregnancy, LT said. \u201cNeither [my boyfriend] and I are either financially or mentally ready to bring another child into the world. It\u2019s hard for me being a single mom working two jobs and a full-time student with one child alone. So I couldn\u2019t imagine doing it with two,\u201d LT said. Louisiana has passed a six-week abortion ban and if it goes into effect, LT would have had to rush the decision or drive across state lines to Arkansas or Texas, neither a trip she could afford. Multiple women called the abortion clinic during the days the Guardian visited, asking if they could still get an abortion. \u201cIt\u2019s already a tedious process for a woman to get an abortion in Louisiana,\u201d Pittman said. A woman must receive state-mandated counseling and wait 24 hours. In recent weeks, after passage of the new law, patients must also be informed, in writing, of the doctors\u2019 credentials at the clinic, their board certifications, if they have medical malpractice insurance and the last 10 years of practice history. One of the licensed physicians in Shreveport, who also does not want to be identified, comes in to do the the state-mandated counseling sessions. One of the patients he saw that day is Dominique, 34. Pittman estimated 70% of those who come in are women of color, like Dominique. \u201cHow many kids do you have?\u201d the doctor asked. \u201cGood spacing on those three, girl,\u201d he said after she responded. Immediately, she laughed and relaxed. The abortion will be her first. She can\u2019t go on birth control because her blood pressure is too high, she told him, so most of the time she uses condoms. The doctor peered at her through his glasses. \u201cThat\u2019s the kicker. Most of the time!\u201d He calculated she\u2019s pregnant in the fourth week of her pregnancy, early enough that even if the state\u2019s six-week abortion ban had been in effect, she would have still been able to get an abortion. The next day, at her second job in her small town across the state line in Texas, Dominique picks up two extra shifts, a favor from her best friend who is her manager, to pay for her abortion. She has $150 put aside. The clinic is giving her another $100, but they told her she wasn\u2019t the worst off they had seen that day, so they couldn\u2019t give her more.

But the term \u201censlaved\u201d, in and of itself, merits further comment, as history and as ideology. How we use these words makes a crucial difference when we think about the meanings of our past.</p> <p>People were not enslaved in Virginia in 1619, they were indentured. The 20 or so Africans were sold and bought as \u201cservants\u201d for a term of years, and they joined a population consisting largely of European indentured servants, mainly poor people from the British Isles whom the Virginia Company of London had transported and sold into servitude.</p> <p>Enslavement was a process that took place step by step, after the mid-17th century. This process of turning \u201cservants\u201d from Africa into racialized workers enslaved for life occurred in the 1660s to 1680s through a succession of Virginia laws that decreed that a child\u2019s status followed that of its mother and that baptism did not automatically confer emancipation. By the end of the seventeenth century, Africans had indeed been marked off by race in law as chattel to be bought, sold, traded, inherited and serve as collateral for business and debt services. This was not already the case in 1619.</p> <p>Even in 1700, Africans were hardly the only unfree colonists, for a majority of those laboring in Virginia were people bound to service. They were indentured whites. Population numbers are crucial in understanding the demography of labor in early Virginia. By 1680, only about 7% of Virginians were of African descent; 20% of Virginians were of African descent by 1700, and by 1750, the 100,000 enslaved Virginian men and women accounted for more than half the population. Here lies the demography of enslavement.</p> <p>In short, the 1619 Africans were not \u201censlaved\u201d. They were townspeople in the Ndongo district of Angola who had been captured by Imbangala warlords and delivered to the port of Luanda for shipment to the Americas. Raiding, capturing and selling people was not an exclusively African practice.</p> <p>Raiding for captives to sell belongs to a long human history that knows no boundaries of time, place or race. This business model unites the ninth-12th-century Vikings who made Dublin western Europe\u2019s largest slave market (think of St Patrick, who had been enslaved by Irish raiders in the fifth century) and 10th-16th-century Cossacks who delivered eastern European peasants to the Black Sea market at Tana for shipment to the wealthy eastern Mediterranean. The earliest foreign policy of the new United States of America targeted the raiders of the Barbary Coast who engaged in a lively slave trade in Europeans (think Robinson Crusoe). Sadly, the phenomenon of warlords who prey on peasants knows no boundaries of time or place.</p> <p>There\u2019s more to Virginia history, of course, than bondage. There\u2019s freedom, not only after the American civil war, but also in the 17th century, when an Angolan man called Antonio, arriving in Virginia in 1621, became Anthony Johnson, a wealthy free farmer and slave-owning planter in Northampton and Accomack counties. His immediate descendants prospered. His eighteenth-century descendants, living within a hardened racial regime, did not. It is in the eighteenth century that we find the more familiar, hardened boundaries of racialized American identity.</p> <p>In Jamestown in July 2019, the president of the United States spoke within a post-eighteenth-century American ideology of race. He dedicated some 688 words to the \u201csettlers\u201d who \u201cworked hard. They had courage and abundance, and a wealth of self-reliance. They strived mightily to turn a profit\u201d. These \u201csettlers\u201d were hardy Christians who \u201cforged what would become the timeless traits of the American character\u201d.</p> <p>But what, in presidential discourse, of the \u201censlaved Africans\u201d arriving the following month of August? They received 67 words that did not include working hard, and the history they \u201cforged\u201d was different. Here lies an emblematic version of the American ideology of race.</p> <p>Within this ideology of race, the Jamestown Africans of 1619 are always already enslaved, so that seeing the 1619 Africans and their descendants as slaves seals them within the permanent identity of enslavement. It says Africans and their descendants are the same as slaves.</p> <p>Scholars call this kind of thinking \u201cessentialist\u201d\u2013 you are intrinsically what you always must be. When enslavement is the essence of black identity, black people cannot figure as American working men and women who play an active role in American history. It is the \u201csettlers\u201d that is, non-Africans, who forge \u201cthe timeless traits of the American character\u201d. They, not African workers, belong to the crucial core of this version of American history. The Africans are an afterthought, so that the president can skip quickly to the Rev Martin Luther King Jr, and finally, to 27 words on how black people have also contributed to the United States of America.</p> <p>Why is this history of 1619 important now, at a time when versions of American society compete politically, when one fraction of the citizenry plots a return to an America whose image was white, and another fraction of the citizenry embraces an evolution into a multiracial, multicultural democracy?

In July, Donald Trump visited Jamestown, Virginia, to commemorate two events in 1619: the July creation of the colony\u2019s representative government, the House of Burgesses, and the August arrival of people he termed \u201censlaved Africans\u201d.

They were provided to the Guardian by a former Shea associate who was copied in on the exchange.</p> <p>Caughran asks Shea to publicize a link to the group\u2019s Facebook page, and put him in touch with \u201cJohn Jacob Schmidt\u201d, the nom de guerre of Shea associate, Jack Robertson. Robertson is a rightwing podcast host who advocates for conservatives to move to the \u201cAmerican Redoubt\u201d in eastern Washington, Idaho and Montana, and, with Shea, campaigns for eastern Washington to secede and form its own state.</p> <p>On Team Rugged website, it is described as \u201ca Christian organization that strongly believes in building manly character and the capability to stand in adversity in young men\u201d.</p> <p>In his email to Shea, however, Caughran offers a different description, saying that the group exists \u201cto provide patriotic and biblical training on war for young men\u201d.</p> <p>He continues: \u201cEverything about it is both politically incorrect and what would be considered shocking truth to most modern Christians.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/20/matt-shea-rightwing-messages-chat-records\">Republican discussed violent attacks and surveillance with rightwingers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Caughran also wrote: \u201cThere will be scenarios where every participant will have to fight against one of the most barbaric enemies that are invading our country, Muslims terrorists (sic)\u201d.</p> <p>Caughran goes on to detail the group\u2019s training regime, writing that \u201cthere will be biblical teaching (some taken from pastor John Weaver\u2019s works) on biblical warfare, the responsibilities, regulations, principles and mindset. So that our young men will be better prepared to fight against physical enemies, and to do so, God\u2019s way and with His blessing\u201d.</p> <p>The Georgia-based Weaver is a controversial preacher whom the Southern Poverty Law Center says is a \u201cleading proponent for training Christians for armed battle\u201d.</p> <p>As well as being a preacher, Weaver is a firearms instructor, and according to the SPLC has given weapons training to members of the League of the South, a neo-Confederate group which marched at the far-right Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville in August 2017 that ended in the death of a protester.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1402f3e5ae391665d1360d443abd9cb29a4b051c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1402f3e5ae391665d1360d443abd9cb29a4b051c/0_185_5064_3039/1000.jpg\" alt=\"White nationalist demonstrators walk into Lee park surrounded by counter demonstrators in Charlottesville, Virginia, 12 August 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">White nationalist demonstrators walk into Lee park surrounded by counter demonstrators in Charlottesville, Virginia, 12 August 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Helber/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In his email to Shea, Caughran goes on to list weapons training as part of the event for attendees. The training will \u201cshow them how to work better as a team, both in achieving physically demanding tasks and on the battlefield. Those who attend will learn combatives, the use of a knife in defense, close quarters shooting with rifle and pistol and how to work effectively in teams of 2, 3 and 4.\u201d</p> <p>In response to the request for Facebook promotion, Shea responds, from an address associated with his law practice, \u201cIt is scheduled to post tomorrow\u201d. He then forwards it to Robertson aka John Jacob Schmidt, writing, \u201cSee below. From Marble meeting. JJS he wants to connect with you\u201d.</p> <p>An LLC called Team Rugged was registered in Washington in 2017 under the name of Michael P Caughran, 23, a resident of Colville, Washington, the seat of Stevens county.

The business filed its most recent annual report in August 2018.</p> <p>An initial filing for the LLC lists the executors of the company, including Barry Byrd, the pastor of Marble Community fellowship, as well as Lucas Olson and Michael Caughran, both of Lewiston, Idaho.</p> <p>Marble Community Fellowship is a Christian community led by pastor Barry Byrd , with a compound on the Columbia River, not far from the Canadian border. It believes in rule by their interpretations of biblical law.</p> <p>As of late July 2019, Team Rugged\u2019s website listed Byrd as an instructor along with Caughran.

      "bodyText": "The Republican politician Matt Shea connected close allies with a group offering training to young men in \u201cbiblical warfare\u201d that includes how to use knives, pistols and rifles, with lessons based in part on the teachings of a Georgia-based neo-Confederate pastor, emails obtained by the Guardian reveal. Shea, who is an elected Washington state representative, later made videos in support of the group, and appeared alongside them at a gathering at a religious community in remote eastern Washington. He also paid the founder of the group money from his campaign fund in 2018. The emails, sent in July 2016, begin with an email from Patrick Caughran, who presents himself as the founder of a training group called Team Rugged. They were provided to the Guardian by a former Shea associate who was copied in on the exchange. Caughran asks Shea to publicize a link to the group\u2019s Facebook page, and put him in touch with \u201cJohn Jacob Schmidt\u201d, the nom de guerre of Shea associate, Jack Robertson. Robertson is a rightwing podcast host who advocates for conservatives to move to the \u201cAmerican Redoubt\u201d in eastern Washington, Idaho and Montana, and, with Shea, campaigns for eastern Washington to secede and form its own state. On Team Rugged website, it is described as \u201ca Christian organization that strongly believes in building manly character and the capability to stand in adversity in young men\u201d. In his email to Shea, however, Caughran offers a different description, saying that the group exists \u201cto provide patriotic and biblical training on war for young men\u201d. He continues: \u201cEverything about it is both politically incorrect and what would be considered shocking truth to most modern Christians.\u201d Caughran also wrote: \u201cThere will be scenarios where every participant will have to fight against one of the most barbaric enemies that are invading our country, Muslims terrorists (sic)\u201d. Caughran goes on to detail the group\u2019s training regime, writing that \u201cthere will be biblical teaching (some taken from pastor John Weaver\u2019s works) on biblical warfare, the responsibilities, regulations, principles and mindset. So that our young men will be better prepared to fight against physical enemies, and to do so, God\u2019s way and with His blessing\u201d. The Georgia-based Weaver is a controversial preacher whom the Southern Poverty Law Center says is a \u201cleading proponent for training Christians for armed battle\u201d. As well as being a preacher, Weaver is a firearms instructor, and according to the SPLC has given weapons training to members of the League of the South, a neo-Confederate group which marched at the far-right Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville in August 2017 that ended in the death of a protester. In his email to Shea, Caughran goes on to list weapons training as part of the event for attendees. The training will \u201cshow them how to work better as a team, both in achieving physically demanding tasks and on the battlefield. Those who attend will learn combatives, the use of a knife in defense, close quarters shooting with rifle and pistol and how to work effectively in teams of 2, 3 and 4.\u201d In response to the request for Facebook promotion, Shea responds, from an address associated with his law practice, \u201cIt is scheduled to post tomorrow\u201d. He then forwards it to Robertson aka John Jacob Schmidt, writing, \u201cSee below. From Marble meeting. JJS he wants to connect with you\u201d. An LLC called Team Rugged was registered in Washington in 2017 under the name of Michael P Caughran, 23, a resident of Colville, Washington, the seat of Stevens county. The email address in the filing is similar to the one that Caughran used to communicate with Shea. In filing materials the business is described as providing \u201cOUTDOOR ACTIVITIES FOR YOUNG MEN AND BOYS TO INCREASE THEIR GOOD CHARACTER AND SKILLS TO PERFORM IN TEAMS AND LEADERSHIP ROLES\u201d. The business filed its most recent annual report in August 2018. An initial filing for the LLC lists the executors of the company, including Barry Byrd, the pastor of Marble Community fellowship, as well as Lucas Olson and Michael Caughran, both of Lewiston, Idaho. Marble Community Fellowship is a Christian community led by pastor Barry Byrd , with a compound on the Columbia River, not far from the Canadian border. It believes in rule by their interpretations of biblical law. As of late July 2019, Team Rugged\u2019s website listed Byrd as an instructor along with Caughran. The Team Rugged Facebook page listed several events in recent years at the Marble compound, including battles with Airsoft guns. Pictures on the Team Rugged website show young boys in fatigues in the forest, armed with Airsoft guns. In 2018, representative Shea was revealed to have distributed a document entitled \u201cBiblical Basis for War\u201d, which appeared to lay out a plan for a theocratic takeover, including the instruction to \u201ckill all males\u201d. Shea denied this interpretation of the document, saying instead that the material was notes for a sermon. In 2015, the year before the Team Rugged email from Caughran, Weaver appeared alongside Shea at the annual God and Country celebration at Marble. Last May, the Guardian revealed that at the 2018 God and Country event, Shea warned of civil unrest while Robertson urged the audience to prepare for civil war. In a video posted to his Facebook page, Shea interviews Team Rugged at the 2017 God and Country event, where he described the group as \u201creturning to basic patriot principles\u201d. Shea, who rarely speaks to the media, and once called journalists \u201cdirty, godless, hateful people\u201d, did not respond to detailed questions sent via email. Caughran did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Longtime Shea critic, and Republican, the Spokane county sheriff, Ozzie Knezovich, said in a telephone conversation that \u201cit almost sounds like going back to the Hitler Youth concept\u201d. Knezovich added: \u201cThere are lines that should never crossed. When you indoctrinate children in radicalized hate, then we wonder why we have the kind of shootings and bombings that we have around the world.\u201d A spokesman for the Washington Republican minority leader, JT Wilcox, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Since the Guardian\u2019s previous revelations about Shea\u2019s involvement in private chats, and his appearances on podcasts and public events, Washington\u2019s state house has commenced an investigation into his activities, and has hired an outside firm to investigate Shea\u2019s associations with political violence.",

The protests, scheduled to start on 16 August, come over a year since Emmerson Mnangagwa won a closely fought election promising investment, transparency and \u201cgood days ahead\u201d for the former British colony. Mnangagwa took power after a military takeover ousted the veteran ruler Robert Mugabe in November 2017. Mugabe, 95, is receiving medical treatment in Singapore.

The interiors are colourful and cute, all mint green woodwork and bubble-gum pink stripes, with an antique pot-bellied stove, wooden floors strewn with rugs and antique fixtures and fittings. A third carriage, in the garden of thatched High Cross Cottage, is the oldest surviving carriage (the First Class Family Saloon) of the London and South Western Railway \u2013 dating from 1876. It has been restored with gold-leaf detail, embossed wallpaper and brass fittings and turned into a dining car offering afternoon tea and three-course dinners. \u2022 Sleep 4 in total, from \u00a3210 for two nights (two-night minimum) or \u00a3620 a week, campingcoach.co.uk Seabank, Selsey, West Sussex Seabank is a beachfront pad created from two restored 19th-century Stroudley railway carriages. \u201cClarrie\u201d and \u201cAnnabel\u201d once plied the London-to-Brighton line (you can still see working examples on Sussex\u2019s Bluebell Railway and Isle of Wight Steam Railway). Now these two are unrecognisable from the outside, converted into a periwinkle-blue and white-clapboard seaside villa with an enclosed veranda for sea views, and circled by a fenced garden with decking. But, inside, you can make out the carriages, decked out in jaunty, seaside chic with cream floorboards and Lloyd Loom chairs in two double bedrooms and two twins with bunk beds. There\u2019s plenty to do in Selsey (boat trips, diving, paddling and beachcombing, with Pagham Harbour nature reserve nearby) but if the rain rolls in there\u2019s a woodburning stove and stacks of board games and books to curl up with. \u2022 Sleeps 8 (four adults and four children), from \u00a3250 for two nights (minimum two-night stay), week from \u00a3500 (Nov-Feb), seabankselsey.com",

      "bodyText": "Top story: \u2018Every penny should be invested in railways\u2019 Good morning \u2013 Warren Murray putting today\u2019s big stories at your fingertips. An increase of about 2.9% in train ticket prices is expected to be confirmed this morning, capping a decade when fares have risen at double the rate of wages. Campaigners and unions have warned that the latest increase risks driving passengers off the railway. The overall cost of taking the train has gone up by 46% since 2009, while wages have only grown by 23%, according to analysis by the TUC, which said operators paid \u00a3200m in dividends to shareholders in 2017-18 and received \u00a33.8bn in public subsidy. \u201cIt\u2019s time to take the railways back into public hands,\u201d said Frances O\u2019Grady, the TUC general secretary. \u201cEvery single penny from every single fare should be invested into our railways.\u201d Campaigners and unions will stage protests against the fare increases at stations around Britain today. * * * Midweek catch-up &gt; The search for answers continues after the body of missing Nora Quoirin, 15, was found in the Malaysian jungle. A postmortem examination is due to be held today. &gt; Flights have resumed after police armed with batons and pepper spray clashed with demonstrators at Hong Kong\u2019s international airport. The airport operator said it had obtained an injunction against protesters. Chinese state TV has shown armoured personnel carriers purportedly driving to Shenzhen, which borders Hong Kong. &gt; A man faces a murder charge in Sydney, Australia after allegedly stabbing a woman to death before attacking others during a city-centre rampage on Tuesday. He was subdued and restrained by bystanders including several British men. &gt; Sadiq Khan, the London mayor, has demanded an explanation from the owners of the King\u2019s Cross development who have admitted using CCTV with facial recognition to surveil the public. &gt; There has been a 13% decline in entries for English A-levels, with teachers and authors warning that GCSE requirements are \u201csucking the joy\u201d out of the subject. Meanwhile Labour has called for university enrolments to be opened only after exam results are published, ending the reliance on predicted grades \u2013 a system that can penalise high-achieving students from disadvantaged backgrounds. * * * No-deal opponents form ranks \u2013 Philip Hammond, the former chancellor leading a bloc of 20 Conservatives opposed to a no-deal Brexit, has warned Boris Johnson it would be a betrayal of the referendum result. The group has written to Johnson accusing him of setting impossible terms for the EU to agree to a deal. The intervention is a sign that Tories opposed to a no-deal Brexit are prepared to vote with opposition parties to prevent Johnson crashing the UK out of the EU on 31 October. John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, has vowed at an Edinburgh festival fringe event to fight attempts to sideline parliament \u201cwith every breath in my body\u201d. He said he would insist on the right of parliament to continue to sit and debate. * * * Hinkley mental health crisis \u2013 Hinkley Point nuclear power station, Britain\u2019s biggest construction project since the second world war, is grappling with a mental illness crisis. The Unite union says it has been told of 10 suicide attempts in the first four months of 2019 and the Guardian understands at least two workers connected to the project have taken their own lives. The main causes of the distress appear to be loneliness, relationship breakdown and the struggle of being sometimes hundreds of miles away from family. Suicide rates in the construction industry are more than three times the national average for men. The owner EDF is implementing a mental health programme on the site, including posters urging troubled contractors to open up and one in 20 workers now trained as a mental health first aider, or \u201cbuddy\u201d. \u2022 In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14. Other international suicide helplines can be found at www.befrienders.org. * * * \u2018Gents, several lives are lost\u2019 \u2013 Two hundred years on from the Peterloo massacre, a note scribbled out by a magistrate and whisked to Whitehall has been unearthed to reveal what could be the first account of the bloodshed.

Allen.\u201d In Manchester a memorial to Peterloo has been made public, days ahead of the anniversary and without anyone there to see it. It is also not wheelchair-accessible \u2013 the council says it will work to fix that with the designer, Turner prizewinner Jeremy Deller. * * * New ad rules bite \u2013 Two television adverts have been banned for showing harmful gender stereotypes, which is a breach of new rules. Volkswagen\u2019s electric car ad included men being astronauts and rock-climbers while a woman sat next to a pram; while a Philadelphia cream cheese ad showed men bungling comically while looking after their babies.

      "bodyText": "Hong Kong protesters have apologised to the public for the chaos caused at the city\u2019s airport, one of the world\u2019s busiest transport hubs, after demonstrations brought flights to a halt for two consecutive days and stranded thousands of visitors. One protest group asked in a lengthy statement for understanding, saying protesters chose the airport as a forum for demonstration only because they no longer felt safe protesting in public due to police violence. The group apologised for clashes on Wednesday, in which police armed with batons and pepper spray clashed with thousands of protesters, saying that \u201cafter months of prolonged resistance, we are frightened, angry and exhausted. Some of us have become easily agitated and over-reacted last night.\u201d In messages posted online, protesters apologised to reporters, paramedics and travellers and vowed to \u201clearn from our mistakes\u201d.

Elsewhere, protesters engaged in a heated debated with a Chinese visitor who was angry at the amount of money the delays had cost him, with one protester throwing coins in his direction. The crowd turned uglier later in the day when hundred of protesters turned on an undercover police officer and then tied up a reporter for the Global Times, a Chinese state news outlet, prompting Hong Kong police to launch a rescue operation. Protesters then clashed with riot police who attempted to force their way into the airport with pepper spray, leading to the arrests of five people.

It\u2019s hard to describe just how deeply disastrous it is. English is under pressure in universities as well. We need these people to come through.\u201d</p> <p>This year\u2019s A-level cohort, who will receive their results on Thursday, were the first to sit the new GCSE English qualifications introduced in 2017 as part of the former education secretary Michael Gove\u2019s sweeping qualification changes, which were intended to make exams more rigorous and challenging.</p> <p>Teachers have since expressed concerns that the new GCSE English language exam is focused too heavily on analysis of historical texts, while English literature involves memorising large amounts of content. The changes, they say, have hit the least able the hardest.</p> <p>One assistant headteacher said: \u201cGCSE English language is sucking the joy out of the study of how we communicate: the power and beauty in words.

      "bodyText": "Authors and teachers\u2019 leaders have called for urgent action to reverse the dwindling popularity of English in sixth forms after it emerged that there had been a 13% decline this summer in entries for all types of English A-level. Ministers are being urged to review recently reformed English GCSEs because of concerns that the new qualifications are \u201csucking the joy\u201d out of the subject and may be putting students off pursuing it at a higher level. According to provisional data from the exams watchdog Ofqual, entries for English language A-level dropped from just under 18,000 in 2018 to less than 14,000 this year. Uptake was also down for English literature, from 41,000 to 37,500, while combined English language and literature dropped from 9,000 to 7,600. \u201cWe should be very, very concerned at this drop in the study of English,\u201d said the author and former teacher Joanne Harris, whose works included the best-selling novel Chocolat. \u201cThis, combined with the loss of so many public libraries, could be the start of a catastrophic decline in the quality of our secondary students, graduates and future colleagues and employees.\u201d The award-winning poet, novelist and teacher Kate Clanchy, who is writer-in-residence at Oxford Spires Academy, where she sees the impact of the reformed GCSEs on pupils, said: \u201cEnglish has just been made less fun. It\u2019s hard to describe just how deeply disastrous it is. English is under pressure in universities as well. We need these people to come through.\u201d This year\u2019s A-level cohort, who will receive their results on Thursday, were the first to sit the new GCSE English qualifications introduced in 2017 as part of the former education secretary Michael Gove\u2019s sweeping qualification changes, which were intended to make exams more rigorous and challenging. Teachers have since expressed concerns that the new GCSE English language exam is focused too heavily on analysis of historical texts, while English literature involves memorising large amounts of content. The changes, they say, have hit the least able the hardest. One assistant headteacher said: \u201cGCSE English language is sucking the joy out of the study of how we communicate: the power and beauty in words. English literature favours those with excellent memories; it has reduced our most magnificent pieces of writing to a collection of quotations.\u201d Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: \u201cIt is right that we should have the highest aspirations for all our students, but this should not equate to turning exams into a joyless slog. We are concerned that the current GCSE specifications are failing to encourage a love of English in young people and this year\u2019s entries at A-level appear to confirm our fears.\u201d Other factors may also be at play, including the government\u2019s drive to increase the uptake of science, technology, engineering and maths \u2013 the Stem subjects. \u201cEnglish has always been thought of (quite wrongly) as an \u2018easy\u2019 (or even vocationally irrelevant) subject for English native speakers.

      "bodyText": "Deep Water 9pm, ITV Adapted from the Windermere novels by Paula Daly, this six-part drama about three women and their struggles to keep their heads above some very deep water has an instant appeal that\u2019s guaranteed to have audiences coming back for more. Mother of three Lisa (Anna Friel) juggles a chaotic family life with running a business and compares herself with her peers: debt-ridden physiotherapist Roz (Sinead Keenan) and wealthy \u2018perfect wife\u2019 Kate (Rosalind Eleazar). Then offers of sex and money muddy the waters. Mike Bradley Interior Design Masters 8pm, BBC Two Reality TV has become so sophisticated that any newcomers had better be on point in this design competition hosted by Fearne Cotton and judged by Michelle Ogundehin. An engaging, catty opener sees two teams of five hopefuls redesign two show homes. The weakest designer will be sent home. MB Murder Case 9pm, BBC Two Stripped across three nights, this documentary tracks the work undertaken by Scotland\u2019s major investigations team. The opener follows the search for missing person Julie Reilly; it finds a perfect balance between forensic police work and the raw emotion of Julie\u2019s family as the awful truth becomes clear. Phil Harrison Obey Giant: The Art and Dissent of Shepard Fairey 9pm, Sky Arts A profile of the American street artist who designed the \u201chope\u201d poster for Obama and founded the Obey clothing brand. It follows him from his early roots in punk rock to his present-day status as an artist whose works hang in some of the world\u2019s most important galleries. MB GameFace 10pm, Channel 4 An utterly triumphant second series wraps up with a pair of episodes that see Marcella (Roisin Conaty) zig-zagging between joy, pain and talking to a horse. After a rough night, she swears off drinking and heads off for a few quiet days in the country with a perilously weak phone signal. But will she get a happy ending? Hannah Verdier The Warwick Uni Rape Chat Scandal 10.35pm, BBC One An established Russell Group institution, Warwick\u2019s reputation was tarnished last year following allegations of violent, online \u201crape chat\u201d among a group of male students. As victims continue legal action against the university, this doc looks into a case as depressing as it is worrying.

      "body": "<p>That title, \u201cParryoke!\u201d: the pun, the exclamation mark, the reference to karaoke. I must admit I went into Tom Parry\u2019s show fearing a certain amount of heavily enforced audience participation, at the very sober hour of 6pm.</p> \n<p>I should have trusted Parry more. As one-third of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/aug/22/pappys-last-show-edinburgh-review\">sketch heroes Pappy\u2019s</a>, he was always the lord of misrule, a performer of utmost generosity and unfakeable enthusiasm, and he remains just that. Besides, any karaoke duties he carries out himself. Parryoke! is his second solo show after his best newcomer nomination <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/aug/11/tom-parry-at-edinburgh-festival-review-tron-pappys-soul-nourishing-silliness\">in </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/aug/11/tom-parry-at-edinburgh-festival-review-tron-pappys-soul-nourishing-silliness\">2015</a>, and it is a tribute to, and a dissection of, weddings, especially the speeches. He charts his journey from being someone who went to more music festivals than weddings, to the complete opposite, from guzzling drugs to guzzling canapes. Earlier this year he got hitched himself.</p> \n<p>The show cracks along, with Parry taking us through some of the classic wedding tropes: the bad jokes, the emotional parents, the dance circles that inevitably spring up at about 9.30pm, and his own technique for getting out of them. Along the way there are very funny routines on unwanted Christmas presents, a bored Shane Richie and a family trip to see his beloved Wolves.</p> \n<p>There is a Peter Kay-ish feel to it all, not just in the subject matter, but also in the comfiness and strong whiff of nostalgia. This is not challenging comedy. But that can be OK: comedians can\u2019t all be edgelords; we need bringers of joy, too, and Parry is one of the best around.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom

      "bodyText": "That title, \u201cParryoke!\u201d: the pun, the exclamation mark, the reference to karaoke. I must admit I went into Tom Parry\u2019s show fearing a certain amount of heavily enforced audience participation, at the very sober hour of 6pm. I should have trusted Parry more. As one-third of the sketch heroes Pappy\u2019s, he was always the lord of misrule, a performer of utmost generosity and unfakeable enthusiasm, and he remains just that. Besides, any karaoke duties he carries out himself. Parryoke! is his second solo show after his best newcomer nomination in 2015, and it is a tribute to, and a dissection of, weddings, especially the speeches. He charts his journey from being someone who went to more music festivals than weddings, to the complete opposite, from guzzling drugs to guzzling canapes. Earlier this year he got hitched himself. The show cracks along, with Parry taking us through some of the classic wedding tropes: the bad jokes, the emotional parents, the dance circles that inevitably spring up at about 9.30pm, and his own technique for getting out of them. Along the way there are very funny routines on unwanted Christmas presents, a bored Shane Richie and a family trip to see his beloved Wolves. There is a Peter Kay-ish feel to it all, not just in the subject matter, but also in the comfiness and strong whiff of nostalgia. This is not challenging comedy. But that can be OK: comedians can\u2019t all be edgelords; we need bringers of joy, too, and Parry is one of the best around. The comfiness mustn\u2019t deflect from his honed comic instincts, either, as an hour of meaty fun-times is harder than it looks. There are no duff routines; everything is there for a reason. And in classic Pappy\u2019s style, he brings together elements of the show as it goes along in a smart and satisfying way. Having said that, his big, bungling finale of doing The Power of Love at his own wedding karaoke is probably 10% too contrived.

Public parks are disappearing. Playgrounds are being sold off. High streets are fast turning to desert.

A large part of what\u2019s missing is social infrastructure. It can be public or private. It is often slightly dog-eared and usually overlooked. But when it vanishes, the social damage can be huge.</p> <p>The American sociologist <a href=\"https://www.ericklinenberg.com/#\" title=\"\">Eric Klinenberg</a> lists some in his recent book, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/sep/24/palaces-for-the-people-at-the-library-everyone-is-welcome\" title=\"\">Palaces for the People</a>: \u201cPeople reduce the time they spend in public settings and hunker down in their safe houses. Social networks weaken. Crime rises. Older and sick people grow isolated. Younger people get addicted to drugs \u2026 Distrust rises and civic participation wanes.\u201d A New York University professor, Klinenberg\u2019s observations hold as true for Brexit Britain as they do for Trump\u2019s America. How often have you read about a grandmother found dead in her own home, with no one popping by for days? How many news stories do you read about teenagers experiencing mental illness as they compare themselves to the images on their screens? And how many times have you complained that everyone is so stuck in their own bubble that politics is hopelessly polarised?</p> <p>In ripping out our social infrastructure, we are outraging a wisdom that goes back centuries and spans countries. Millions of Britons will spend part of this summer on a plaza or a piazza or people-watching on the public square outside Paris\u2019s Centre Pompidou. The <a href=\"https://www.arts.ac.uk/colleges/central-saint-martins/people/shumi-bose\" title=\"\">architectural historian Shu<br>mi Bose</a> points out that library designs proliferated during the Enlightenment, alongside blueprints for monuments \u201cto the exercise of the sovereignty of the people\u201d.

After all, the quality of such hard infrastructure influences where multinationals set up shop: it is money-making. But parks and libraries don\u2019t generate cash. Social infrastructure has no lobby, no registry of assets and certainly no government agency. No Whitehall official monitors how much of it has closed or withered away \u2013 that relies on civil society groups to file freedom of information requests or badger town halls with survey. Everyone knows we need it, yet just as our economic model prizes shareholder returns over investment in the National Grid, so our politics relies on drawing in the voters with unfeasibly low taxes. Until one day, something breaks and all hell breaks loose.</p> <p>So here is a suggestion for Jeremy Corbyn or Nicola Sturgeon or <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-45681167\" title=\"\">Adam Price</a> or whoever else fancies it. Talk about the importance of social infrastructure. Promise to set up a commission explicitly to audit what we have and help protect it. Commit public money to it, alongside gentle pressure on the private sector to do its bit. That way, we can publicly mark the public institutions we all know we need \u2013 and show the esteem due to the people who keep them going and use them. The spirit we need is that summed up by the librarian who rhapsodises to Klinenberg about his branch: \u201cThe library really is a palace. It bestows nobility on people who can\u2019t otherwise afford a shred of it. People need to have nobility and dignity in their lives. And, you know, they need other people to recognise it in them too.\u201d</p> <p>Our people deserve palaces.</p> <p>\u2022 Aditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnist</p>",

Younger people get addicted to drugs \u2026 Distrust rises and civic participation wanes.\u201d A New York University professor, Klinenberg\u2019s observations hold as true for Brexit Britain as they do for Trump\u2019s America. How often have you read about a grandmother found dead in her own home, with no one popping by for days? How many news stories do you read about teenagers experiencing mental illness as they compare themselves to the images on their screens? And how many times have you complained that everyone is so stuck in their own bubble that politics is hopelessly polarised? In ripping out our social infrastructure, we are outraging a wisdom that goes back centuries and spans countries. Millions of Britons will spend part of this summer on a plaza or a piazza or people-watching on the public square outside Paris\u2019s Centre Pompidou. The architectural historian Shu mi Bose points out that library designs proliferated during the Enlightenment, alongside blueprints for monuments \u201cto the exercise of the sovereignty of the people\u201d. During the second world war, the Mass Observation collective wrote of the British pub: \u201cOnce a man has bought or been bought his glass of beer, he has entered an environment in which he is participant, rather than spectator.\u201d When it comes to transport or energy or sewage, Britain has a National Infrastructure Commission that monitors the country\u2019s needs and guides parliament on where to direct spending. After all, the quality of such hard infrastructure influences where multinationals set up shop: it is money-making. But parks and libraries don\u2019t generate cash. Social infrastructure has no lobby, no registry of assets and certainly no government agency. No Whitehall official monitors how much of it has closed or withered away \u2013 that relies on civil society groups to file freedom of information requests or badger town halls with survey. Everyone knows we need it, yet just as our economic model prizes shareholder returns over investment in the National Grid, so our politics relies on drawing in the voters with unfeasibly low taxes. Until one day, something breaks and all hell breaks loose. So here is a suggestion for Jeremy Corbyn or Nicola Sturgeon or Adam Price or whoever else fancies it. Talk about the importance of social infrastructure. Promise to set up a commission explicitly to audit what we have and help protect it. Commit public money to it, alongside gentle pressure on the private sector to do its bit. That way, we can publicly mark the public institutions we all know we need \u2013 and show the esteem due to the people who keep them going and use them. The spirit we need is that summed up by the librarian who rhapsodises to Klinenberg about his branch: \u201cThe library really is a palace. It bestows nobility on people who can\u2019t otherwise afford a shred of it. People need to have nobility and dignity in their lives. And, you know, they need other people to recognise it in them too.\u201d Our people deserve palaces. \u2022 Aditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnist",

Their peaceful protest turned bloody when Manchester magistrates ordered Yeoman \u2013 a private militia paid for by rich locals \u2013 to storm the crowd with sabres.</p>\n    <p>Most historians agree that 14 people were definitely killed in the massacre \u2013 15 if you include the unborn child of Elizabeth Gaunt, killed in the womb after she was beaten by constables in custody. A further three named people are believed to have either been stabbed or trampled to death.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Why is it called Peterloo?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The name was first coined five days after the massacre by James Wroe, editor of the Manchester Observer, the city\u2019s first radical newspaper (no relation to the Observer of today). According to historian Robert Poole, Peterloo was \u201ca bitter pun, comparing the cowardly attacks by the Yeomanry and soldiers on unarmed civilians to the brutality suffered at Waterloo.\u201d</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What did the protesters want?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>They wanted political reform. The years leading up to Peterloo had been tough for working class people and they wanted a voice in parliament to put their needs and wants on the political agenda, inspired by the French Revolution across the Channel. Machines had begun to take jobs in the lucrative cotton industry but periodic trade slumps closed factories at short notice, putting workers out on the street. The Napoleonic Wars, which ended in 1815 with the Battle of Waterloo, had taken a heavy toll on the nation\u2019s finances, and 350,000 ex-servicemen returned home needing jobs and food. Yet those in power seemed more interested in lining their own pockets than helping the poor.</p>\n    <p>At that point, only the richest landowners could vote, and large swathes of the country were not represented in Westminster.

      "bodyText": "It was a defining moment in British political history, paving the way in the long struggle for democratic representation of the disenfranchised working classes. Now, 200 years on from the Peterloo massacre in which peaceful protesters were cut down by sabre-wielding cavalry, a hastily scribbled note has been unearthed to reveal what could be the first account of the bloodshed. Penned on a scrap of paper by a magistrate who watched the violence unfold, the message was immediately dispatched from the scene in Manchester to Whitehall by horse-drawn carriage, arriving more than 24 hours later. It is among a treasure trove of documents released by the National Archives to mark the bicentenary of the slaughter, in which 18 people were killed and more than 650 injured when cavalry charged at pro-democracy protesters gathered at St Peter\u2019s Field. The massacre \u2013 later dubbed \u201cPeterloo\u201d in reference to the Battle of Waterloo which took place four years earlier \u2013 was recently brought to the big screen in a feature-length Mike Leigh adaptation. Henry Hunt, a radical reformer who was later jailed, spoke at the protest which was calling for parliamentary reform at a time when large swathes of the country were unrepresented and only wealthy landowners could vote. Dressed in their Sunday best, tens of thousands of demonstrators flocked from miles around, carrying banners and flags. Unusually for the time, the crowd included a sizeable number of women, clad in white to symbolise their virtue as they joined the fight for suffrage. The newly released documents, which included correspondence from the government and protesters, give an intimate portrayal of events from both sides. The first account of the atrocity was recorded by Haigh Allen, a young magistrate from Huddersfield who was in Manchester to monitor events, barely an hour after the massacre on 16 August 1819. \u201cGents,\u201d he wrote at 2.30pm. \u201cThe meeting took place at 1 o\u2019clock. Hunt in the chair with 16 flags and 7 caps of Liberty hoisted up amongst upwards of 60,000 people, the cavalry has just broke in upon them, the flags are taken, Hunt and his party secured, several lives are lost and a number wounded. The cavalry are now securing the streets in all directions, \u00bd past 2 o\u2019clock, yours H. Allen.\u201d The violence was triggered after magistrates ordered the Manchester and Salford Yeomanry, a volunteer cavalry regiment who some accused of being drunk, to arrest Hunt and other organisers, fearing they had revolutionary intent. Galloping to detain Hunt, one rider knocked down a woman and killed her two-year-old child who was thrown from her arms. As panic ensued, the 15th Hussars and another yeomanry regiment were ordered to disperse the crowd, causing more bloodshed as protesters were trampled and crushed. Christopher Day, the head of modern domestic records at the National Archives, said: \u201cAll of the accounts we have are quite partisan and also it was a very confusing situation. What\u2019s interesting about the stuff that we have is that we have accounts from officials written at the time before this becomes a political issue.

Meanwhile, a letter sent months before the massacre in March 1819 from Henry Hobhouse, the then permanent undersecretary of the Home Office, to a Lancashire magistrate gives an insight into the thinking in Whitehall at the time. Replying to a letter from magistrates detailing disaffection in Lancashire, Hobhouse writes that he and home secretary, Lord Sidmouth, fear that \u201cyour country will not be tranquillized, until Blood shall have been shed either by the Law or the sword\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Two thousand veterans of the British army\u2019s deployment in Northern Ireland during the Troubles are expected to attend a deliberately low-key commemorative service in England to mark 50 years since troops first went on the streets. Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, will be present at the National Arboretum in Staffordshire, but he will not make a speech. More than 3,600 people were killed during the Troubles, including civilians, paramilitaries and 1,441 armed forces personnel, in a conflict that officially ended in 1998 but the legacy of which remains contentious. Lt Gen James Bashall, the president of the British Legion. which organised the event, said that the ceremony intended \u201cto honour the service and sacrifice of those from military and emergency services\u201d who served in what is known as Operation Banner by the military. But as many as 10,000 people are expected to attend a separate event on Saturday in Lisburn, Northern Ireland, organised by the Northern Ireland Veterans Association. All veterans and their families have been invited to attend. Some veterans have complained that the MoD is not organising the commemoration in a year when a string of official events were held to mark the 75th anniversary of D-day and 50 years of nuclear weapons deployment was marked at Westminster Abbey. Earlier this year, Richard Kemp, a former commander of British forces in Afghanistan, said the decision was a \u201cdeliberate snub\u201d. Another Northern Ireland veteran, Labour MP and Sheffield city mayor Dan Jarvis, said that \u201cwe should not forget the service and sacrifice of our armed forces\u201d and \u201cthe wider human cost of the conflict\u201d even though the decision to deploy troops remains contentious. About 300,000 military personnel served in Northern Ireland between 1969 and the official end of Operation Banner in 2007, making it the longest continuous deployment in modern UK military history. Troops were first deployed on 14 August 1969 after rioting broke out in Derry, which began after nationalists threw stones and bottles at a contentious Protestant Apprentice Boys parade two days earlier. The presence of the army was broadly welcomed at first on both sides to restore law and order, but the presence of British forces became a source of nationalist resentment and violent conflict began a year later. Thirteen civil rights protesters were killed by paratroopers in Derry in 1972 on what became known as Bloody Sunday, although it was only earlier this year that one of the soldiers, soldier F, was prosecuted for the murder of two of the protesters. He is due to appear in court next month. The decision to prosecute only one soldier prompted anger from nationalists, while several Tory MPs including the veterans minister, Johnny Mercer, have called for British soldiers to be included in a controversial proposed amnesty from historical prosecution. Soldiers were repeatedly targeted by the IRA in subsequent year. The last soldier killed during the Troubles was L/Bdr Stephen Restorick, 23, who was shot dead by a sniper in February 1997. In Northern Ireland, the anniversary is being marked with a mix of melancholy, nostalgia and recrimination, as well as anxiety over a new round of sectarian tension. Activists who marched for equal rights for Catholics in 1969 have rued how a peaceful campaign inspired by the US civil rights movement helped light the fuse for three decades of violence that claimed so many lives. Participants at seminars, commemorations and other events in Derry and Belfast have debated who was to blame and whether the carnage could have been avoided. In a memoir published this week, the writer Malachi O\u2019Doherty said Catholics started the riots that triggered a backlash from police and loyalists that in turn led to the start of Operation Banner. \u201cThere are lessons to be learned from that week,\u201d O\u2019Doherty wrote in the Belfast Telegraph. \u201cThe main one is that when you live in a divided society you have to make an effort to understand the perspective of the other side. There\u2019s no sign of much of that happening.\u201d The 1998 Good Friday agreement largely ended the violence but the collapse in power-sharing, tension over Brexit and a recent spate of clashes shows there is still a glow in the embers. Youths in the nationalist Bogside area of Derry have hurled petrol bombs and paint bombs at police for three consecutive nights. The clashes followed a march through the city by an Apprentice Boys loyalist flute band that wore the insignia of the parachute regiment \u2013 a provocative expression of support for the regiment involved in Bloody Sunday.",

This made her doubt whether she could become a life model \u2013 it took Blake to convince her that she could.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d been waiting for someone to tell me it\u2019s fine to pose for students if you\u2019re different,\u201d she says, over coffee near her London studio. Like Blake, Lagarde says her hang-ups quickly dissipated. \u201cThat\u2019s the beauty of doing this,\u201d she says. \u201cYou might feel vulnerable posing, but as a painter I also know how vulnerable people can feel behind the easel \u2013 you are always questioning and judging yourself. I soon realised we are a team, all trying to be brave.\u201d</p> <p>Blake is currently preparing to be brave once more. He\u2019s about to deliver the first of several talks in art galleries on the contentious subject of <a href=\"https://www.dominicblakelifemodel.co.uk/are-life-models-artists\">Are Life Models Artists?</a> His position is that they are more than simply source material for painters \u2013 they\u2019re creative partners who use their bodies to \u201cpaint\u201d the space around them.

What did you think that was? That was the work of art right there \u2013 and now it\u2019s vanished.\u201d</p> <p>Blake had no idea his body could be so flexible.

Because doing this interview is making me happy, so my poses later could be really open, whereas when I\u2019m feeling depressed my poses can be more compact.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Minutes can seem like hours \u2013 it can be nightmarish</p> <footer> <cite></cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Being a life model isn\u2019t easy.

But you learn what your body can handle, and how to shift your weight making micro movements that aren\u2019t perceptible.\u201d</p> <p>Lagarde agrees: \u201cI\u2019ve been life-modelling for a year and I\u2019m already feeling it in my knees and hips.

But that is like any job.\u201d</p> <p>Blake has his share of funny stories, like the time the room was so hot, the model posing alongside him fainted and collapsed on top of him, or the time a woman was so displeased with his position that she walked right up and just moved his legs herself. \u201cThat may reveal attitudes that exist within the life room,\u201d he says. \u201cThat models are effectively objects.

Furthermore, seeing how other artists approach painting her fingers \u2013 often ignoring the finer details \u2013 has forced her to question her own practice: \u201cBecause you\u2019re like, \u2018I\u2019ve seen a shoulder before, I know how that is.\u2019 But you don\u2019t know <em>this</em> person\u2019s shoulder.

Craig Donaldson first encountered life drawing when he was on a stag do (yes, really \u2013 life drawing has apparently become a thing on the stag and hen circuits).

That\u2019s quite an ego boost.\u201d Donaldson\u2019s different approach is partly reflected in the places he models, which can be more relaxed: he\u2019s done classes outside, in pubs and on gay stag dos where \u201cpeople aren\u2019t really drawing, they\u2019re just there to perv at you really.

Not in the art world, says Blake, who claims the idea that people only want beautiful, slim, female nudes is a myth. \u201cThe reality is you want to draw different people, different ages, sizes and shapes. It would be boring to draw the same type of body every week.\u201d</p> <p>So what of Blake\u2019s central question: can life models be artists? Unsurprisingly, Donaldson doesn\u2019t consider himself an artist, although he\u2019s open to the idea that life modelling <em>could</em> be an artform. \u201cIf you\u2019re directing things then it could be,\u201d he says. \u201cGenerally, you are choosing the poses you\u2019re doing, the artists don\u2019t have control over that.\u201d</p> <p>Lagarde takes a similar view \u2013 she says it would be too exhausting to consider her whole life as an art practice, but believes modelling can be elevated to an artform by people like Blake. \u201cIt\u2019s so hard to define art, but it has a lot to do with the presence and sincerity you bring. For me art is about offering another perspective, and he does that.\u201d</p> <p>Blake\u2019s belief that life models can be artists brings with it a whole political dimension. Because if they are contributing to the finished work, should they not be entitled to better pay? \u201cThere are studios where I\u2019m paid less than the cleaners,\u201d he says. \u201cOf course they should be paid enough money to live on, too, but I feel quite irked by that.\u201d</p> <p>Lately, Blake\u2019s started negotiating a percentage of any work\u2019s eventual sale fee: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t dream of doing that unless I felt I\u2019d truly collaborated,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd it doesn\u2019t have to be 50/50. But some painters who have asked to work with me are selling works for \u00a340,000. It would be grotesquely unfair if my cut was \u00a3200.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I feel that if you\u2019re painting a portrait, you\u2019re extracting someone\u2019s soul</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Of course, as Blake acknowledges, there is another argument: that painters train for years to reach the level at which they can produce paintings that command a fee. \u201cBut I still feel that if you\u2019re painting a portrait you\u2019re extracting someone\u2019s soul.\u201d</p> <p>Lagarde says modelling has encouraged her to pay her own models a better fee, around \u00a320\u2013\u00a325 an hour. But she is unsure about whether models should be commanding a percentage of a sale: \u201cIt can take me six months to finish a painting in my head, and I don\u2019t feel I owe the model for that six months. But I need to value their time while they\u2019re here. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t like people taking pictures of me. It\u2019s not so much that they\u2019re taking a picture of my nudity, but that they\u2019re taking my time.\u201d</p> <p>While fair pay is an issue, none of the life models I spoke to are really in it for the money. For each of them, in different ways, it involves a mix of confidence building, physical challenge and emotional satisfaction. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s powerfully moving,\u201d says Blake. \u201cI\u2019ve been known to burst into tears at the end of a session.\u201d </p> <ul> <li><p>Dominic Blake\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.mallgalleries.org.uk/whats-on/events/are-life-models-artists-talk-dominic-blake\">Are Life Models Artists? is at Mall Galleries, London, on 15 August</a>.

      "bodyText": "The first time Dominic Blake took his clothes off in front of an art class was, as you might imagine, a daunting experience. \u201cI was still wearing my gown,\u201d he says, \u201cand I had beads of sweat pouring down my face. There were about 40 people and I was looking at the doors and windows for escape routes.\u201d If you have an image of what a life model might be like \u2013 someone with a toned physique, perhaps, and an exhibitionist streak \u2013 then think again. \u201cAt the time I had the most negative attitudes about how I looked,\u201d says Blake, 40, seated in the Royal Academy\u2019s life drawing room where he often works. \u201cAnd those attitudes crippled me. I didn\u2019t have the normal experiences people usually have growing up. I didn\u2019t have a girlfriend until I was in my mid-20s.\u201d Yet something magical happened after Blake disrobed. The artists started adjusting their easels, measuring him up, and drawing. Blake realised they were treating him no differently to any other person. \u201cThen I saw the paintings emerging and it was the most incredible thing. I realised we were all travelling on this journey together. It was incredible, like sorcery.\u201d Up until this point, Blake\u2019s work in various museum admin positions had seemed somewhat meaningless.

But I need to value their time while they\u2019re here. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t like people taking pictures of me. It\u2019s not so much that they\u2019re taking a picture of my nudity, but that they\u2019re taking my time.\u201d While fair pay is an issue, none of the life models I spoke to are really in it for the money. For each of them, in different ways, it involves a mix of confidence building, physical challenge and emotional satisfaction. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s powerfully moving,\u201d says Blake. \u201cI\u2019ve been known to burst into tears at the end of a session.\u201d Dominic Blake\u2019s Are Life Models Artists? is at Mall Galleries, London, on 15 August. Suzon Lagarde\u2019s work is on display at Mall Galleries until 17 August.",

      "body": "<p>Late in 1945, Frank Macias returned to El Paso, Texas, a hero of the second world war. He had been in the US army\u2019s 554th anti-aircraft artillery battalion, surviving the allied breakthrough of Operation Cobra and the Battle of the Bulge. He had suffered the devastation of seeing his childhood friend die by a direct-hit air bomb. At one point, the California native even helped bring down a Nazi plane. But none of that mattered in some parts. Frank\u2019s sister Isabel, who is also my grandmother, still remembers the dissonance when that autumn they walked past a diner display declaring: \u201cNo Dogs or Mexicans Allowed.\u201d They felt betrayed.</p> <p>Many Mexican Americans believed life would change in Texas. They had put their lives in danger as a deposit on the long-term investment project known as the American dream.

And yet most communities returned to strict race-based hierarchies. This is illustrated by a series of shocking acts of postwar violence, which are documented in the Voces database, the largest Latino oral history archive in the US, which began in 1999 and is celebrating its 20th anniversary this year<em>.</em></p> <p>After 22 people, including children, were murdered by a white supremacist who targeted Mexicans, the lack of understanding and ignorance of the Mexican American experience in the US has been depressingly visible. Thankfully the stories collected by Voces help to contextualize this massacre besides other acts of hate this group has experienced.</p> <p>It took<em> </em>more than 50 years for a substantive oral scholarship of Mexican Americans from the second world war to begin, as good an example as any of the cultural erasure they have faced in the US.</p> <p>Of course, that\u2019s one part of a long, oft-repeated story.</p> <p>Rivas-Rodriguez first thought about the project after writing an article for Dallas Life magazine. Titled Brothers In Arms, it featured Mexican American veterans of the second world war she\u2019d researched through books and interviews. But she still felt frustrated there weren\u2019t enough primary sources available. With the help of two other University of Texas professors, David Montejano and Carlos Vel\u00e9z-Iba\u00f1ez, she prepared a framework for capturing video interviews that could be consistently accurate and provided a way for people, including her students and volunteers, to produce a professional journalistic historical document.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/09/el-paso-shooting-juarez-residents-support\">\u2018A town of love and peace\u2019: El Pasoans support each other in wake of attack</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The instructions she developed included consent forms, video tips and, for second world war-era folks, a detailed questionnaire touching on everything including family life, dating and basic training. Rivas-Rodriguez said she interviewed her own parents at the start. \u201cThey\u2019re both gone now and I\u2019ll be forever thankful for those interviews,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The Voces project, which also includes nonfiction books, documents untold stories and expands upon those most of the Mexican American community may have only heard about in passing. That is important. As critical as it is for white Americans to know about this history, lack of access to these stories has also robbed Mexican Americans of the full scope of their heritage.</p> <p>One story tells of a young army private named Benigno Aguirre, who was nearly beaten to death by 12<strong> </strong>white youths in Uvalde, Texas, after local police had encouraged them to \u201cgo hunting\u201d. The suspects were sons of rich white lawyers and ranchers who would all get off with probation or fines while Aguirre recovered in the hospital for months.</p> <p>Another was the infuriating experience of Macario Garcia, who was the first Medal of Honor recipient of Mexican descent, with President Harry Truman personally commending him. Ten days later he was refused service and beaten at a south Texas diner. Several men and women, like Frances Rodriguez Luna, mentioned in interviews how Garcia\u2019s troubles inspired them to fight racism as local activists and civil rights leaders.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b81d13941db94b7660c76fa1a393a7567bedd105\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b81d13941db94b7660c76fa1a393a7567bedd105/16_69_682_852/400.jpg\" alt=\"Harry Truman and Macario Garcia, who was the first Medal of Honor recipient of Mexican descent.\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Harry Truman and Macario Garcia, who was the first Medal of Honor recipient of Mexican descent.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: National Archives and Records Administration</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is also a reference to the awful case of soldier <a href=\"https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/vef01\">Felix Longoria</a>\u2019s remains being refused by a cemetery in Three Rivers. It led to a huge outcry in 1949 that ended up involving then senator Lyndon Johnson and the reporter Walter Winchell calling them out on the radio (\u201cThe big state of Texas looks mighty small tonight\u201d). Longoria eventually received a burial in Arlington national cemetery.</p> <p>The stories go on.</p> <p>It\u2019s a cultural tragedy that thousands died without providing a life record. More than 800 oral histories in 20 years is a great achievement but a drop in the ocean for the near-million Mexican American soldiers who fought in the war, the millions who stayed home, and everyone else who\u2019s lived a life of consequence and hardship since. With an estimated 348 veterans of the second world war dying every day, most accounts are now lost to history. This was sadly the case for another great-uncle of mine, Freddy Macias, a Korean war Purple Heart winner and a joyous storyteller who passed away last year.</p> <p>According to Albert Caramillo, a Stanford history professor, Mexican ethnic erasure has taken place since the aftermath of the Mexican-American war, with the US demanding Mexicans who wanted to become citizens be counted as white. Caramillo also says that because Latinos like Frank were labeled as white in military documents, their numbers were likely undercounted \u2013 most official US government figures say about 400,000 fought in the second world war but it was probably closer to a million.</p> <p>For Rivas-Rodriguez, Mexican Americans\u2019 lack of opportunities, whether to tell their story, get an education, or participate in America\u2019s political system, has been the biggest challenge they have faced since the postwar era. In one example, racist legislators in south Texas, blocked them from gaining political power for years, leading to, at several points, the steering of higher education spending away from Mexican-majority areas. Instead, some districts placed kids in mental wards for speaking Spanish. As Renato Ramirez, a Del Mar College political science professor, said in a recent <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtmuB-N8__A&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=3354\">Voces interview</a>, the state threw them a paltry bone of money to \u201csuck on\u201d in order to not get sued. He is referring to the South Texas Border Initiative, an early 90s program, which came about after the state was sued for discrimination, and promised to improve school systems in south Texas with an expected funding of $10bn in ten years. Unfortunately, and not surprisingly, the state managed to only provide $186m.</p> <p>Despite these challenges, many were determined to beat the odds. Thousands used the GI Bill to educate themselves. Other veterans started the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund (Maldef) to oppose injustice. Agriculture workers fought to gain benefits. According to Rivas-Rodriguez, one soldier who came back from the second world war, <a href=\"https://voces.lib.utexas.edu/collections/stories/alfred-j-hernandez\">Alfred J</a><a href=\"https://voces.lib.utexas.edu/collections/stories/alfred-j-hernandez\"> Hernandez</a>, exemplified this best for her. At first, Hernandez was so furious at the racism he encountered that he wanted to leave the area for a better life in Mexico or up in the north-west. But his wife talked him out of it. \u201cThis is where the battle has to be,\u201d the professor said she told him. \u201c\u2018This is where you\u2019re needed\u2019 and he stayed there and worked on civil rights issues the rest of his life.\u201d He became the first Latino judge in Houston\u2019s history.</p> <p><em>Jose Fermoso is a freelance writer covering Silicon Valley and world culture.

This is illustrated by a series of shocking acts of postwar violence, which are documented in the Voces database, the largest Latino oral history archive in the US, which began in 1999 and is celebrating its 20th anniversary this year. After 22 people, including children, were murdered by a white supremacist who targeted Mexicans, the lack of understanding and ignorance of the Mexican American experience in the US has been depressingly visible. Thankfully the stories collected by Voces help to contextualize this massacre besides other acts of hate this group has experienced. It took more than 50 years for a substantive oral scholarship of Mexican Americans from the second world war to begin, as good an example as any of the cultural erasure they have faced in the US. Of course, that\u2019s one part of a long, oft-repeated story. Rivas-Rodriguez first thought about the project after writing an article for Dallas Life magazine. Titled Brothers In Arms, it featured Mexican American veterans of the second world war she\u2019d researched through books and interviews. But she still felt frustrated there weren\u2019t enough primary sources available. With the help of two other University of Texas professors, David Montejano and Carlos Vel\u00e9z-Iba\u00f1ez, she prepared a framework for capturing video interviews that could be consistently accurate and provided a way for people, including her students and volunteers, to produce a professional journalistic historical document. The instructions she developed included consent forms, video tips and, for second world war-era folks, a detailed questionnaire touching on everything including family life, dating and basic training. Rivas-Rodriguez said she interviewed her own parents at the start. \u201cThey\u2019re both gone now and I\u2019ll be forever thankful for those interviews,\u201d she said. The Voces project, which also includes nonfiction books, documents untold stories and expands upon those most of the Mexican American community may have only heard about in passing. That is important. As critical as it is for white Americans to know about this history, lack of access to these stories has also robbed Mexican Americans of the full scope of their heritage. One story tells of a young army private named Benigno Aguirre, who was nearly beaten to death by 12 white youths in Uvalde, Texas, after local police had encouraged them to \u201cgo hunting\u201d. The suspects were sons of rich white lawyers and ranchers who would all get off with probation or fines while Aguirre recovered in the hospital for months. Another was the infuriating experience of Macario Garcia, who was the first Medal of Honor recipient of Mexican descent, with President Harry Truman personally commending him. Ten days later he was refused service and beaten at a south Texas diner. Several men and women, like Frances Rodriguez Luna, mentioned in interviews how Garcia\u2019s troubles inspired them to fight racism as local activists and civil rights leaders. There is also a reference to the awful case of soldier Felix Longoria\u2019s remains being refused by a cemetery in Three Rivers. It led to a huge outcry in 1949 that ended up involving then senator Lyndon Johnson and the reporter Walter Winchell calling them out on the radio (\u201cThe big state of Texas looks mighty small tonight\u201d). Longoria eventually received a burial in Arlington national cemetery. The stories go on. It\u2019s a cultural tragedy that thousands died without providing a life record. More than 800 oral histories in 20 years is a great achievement but a drop in the ocean for the near-million Mexican American soldiers who fought in the war, the millions who stayed home, and everyone else who\u2019s lived a life of consequence and hardship since. With an estimated 348 veterans of the second world war dying every day, most accounts are now lost to history. This was sadly the case for another great-uncle of mine, Freddy Macias, a Korean war Purple Heart winner and a joyous storyteller who passed away last year. According to Albert Caramillo, a Stanford history professor, Mexican ethnic erasure has taken place since the aftermath of the Mexican-American war, with the US demanding Mexicans who wanted to become citizens be counted as white. Caramillo also says that because Latinos like Frank were labeled as white in military documents, their numbers were likely undercounted \u2013 most official US government figures say about 400,000 fought in the second world war but it was probably closer to a million. For Rivas-Rodriguez, Mexican Americans\u2019 lack of opportunities, whether to tell their story, get an education, or participate in America\u2019s political system, has been the biggest challenge they have faced since the postwar era. In one example, racist legislators in south Texas, blocked them from gaining political power for years, leading to, at several points, the steering of higher education spending away from Mexican-majority areas. Instead, some districts placed kids in mental wards for speaking Spanish. As Renato Ramirez, a Del Mar College political science professor, said in a recent Voces interview, the state threw them a paltry bone of money to \u201csuck on\u201d in order to not get sued. He is referring to the South Texas Border Initiative, an early 90s program, which came about after the state was sued for discrimination, and promised to improve school systems in south Texas with an expected funding of $10bn in ten years. Unfortunately, and not surprisingly, the state managed to only provide $186m. Despite these challenges, many were determined to beat the odds. Thousands used the GI Bill to educate themselves. Other veterans started the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund (Maldef) to oppose injustice. Agriculture workers fought to gain benefits. According to Rivas-Rodriguez, one soldier who came back from the second world war, Alfred J Hernandez, exemplified this best for her. At first, Hernandez was so furious at the racism he encountered that he wanted to leave the area for a better life in Mexico or up in the north-west. But his wife talked him out of it. \u201cThis is where the battle has to be,\u201d the professor said she told him. \u201c\u2018This is where you\u2019re needed\u2019 and he stayed there and worked on civil rights issues the rest of his life.\u201d He became the first Latino judge in Houston\u2019s history.

It is a cautionary tale, he says: \u201cLike HP Lovecraft, but with cookies.\u201d</p> <p>Kim-Joy has never had this many people in her kitchen, and she loves it. \u201cUsually, it\u2019s just me on my own, with Nabil looking at me going: \u2018How have you made all this mess?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>I decide this is going to be just like the tent, only much better.</p> <h2><strong>The challenges</strong></h2> <p>The recipes are from Kim-Joy\u2019s forthcoming cookbook, a compendium of edible cuteness. The plan is for the guest bakers to collaborate on baking, then compete on decorating.</p> <p>\u201cDo you have enough ingredients?\u201d asks Nabil.</p> <p>\u201cI think so \u2026\u201d says Kim-Joy.</p> <p>On your marks, get set, bake!</p> <h2><strong>Lavender &amp; lemon pandaleines</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f9a3fc6062b0d84102b04cbc6bf8253b267a1dcf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f9a3fc6062b0d84102b04cbc6bf8253b267a1dcf/0_0_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tair piping \u2018pandaleine\u2019 mixture.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tair piping \u2018pandaleine\u2019 mixture.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The three bakers take it in turns to squeeze blobs of dough into the chilled tray\u2019s shell-shaped moulds. When it is time to slide the day\u2019s first bake into the oven, everyone crowds around and sings with joy.</p> <p>Things get serious when the madeleines have cooled down, however, and Kim-Joy declares that it is time to \u201cstart dipping\u201d. There is silence in the kitchen. You could hear a chocolate sprinkle drop.</p> <p>After testing the black icing for consistency, Rowan cautiously pipes on her first panda face. It is a bit wonky. She promptly calls him Boris, and says she may just eat him. Lauren is next, and Rowan channels Jonathan from Queer Eye: \u201cLook at this confidence! YASSS!\u201d Tair is a picture of stoic calm \u2013 until his whole body heaves a huge sigh of relief and I realise he hadn\u2019t been breathing.</p> <p>The rack fills up with a menagerie of panda-ish creatures \u2013 some mouse-like, some sleeping, one with a goatee \u2013 and I gain a new appreciation for the skill involved in drawing on sponge with liquid sugar.</p> <h2><strong>Pigfiteroles in mud</strong></h2> <p>In this challenge a batch of profiteroles have their tops sliced off before being filled with strawberry cream and given piggy faces with icing and pink marzipan.</p> <p>Kim-Joy\u2019s recipe says they are \u201cquick and actually so simple\u201d to make. The level of collective concentration, though, would suggest this is optimistic. Just watching the bakers peer into the oven to check if the choux balls are browning makes me feel nervous, and that is well before they have turned them into baby boars.</p> <p>Rowan whips some cream with freeze-dried strawberry powder and sugar, then dribbles in some pink food dye. Lauren methodically makes all her marzipan snouts then heads to the stove to melt dark chocolate which will act as mud. When Tair has finished slicing and dolloping pink cream, he anxiously starts icing faces. It only requires two little dots for the eyes and two smaller dots for the nostrils. But a shake of the hand here or a squeeze of the piping bag there and things can quickly take a turn for the monstrous. Our bakers are not to be undone by royal icing, though. Their composure is impressive.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e2181b150a08267d4ffbf3304d72ca5e914b81d2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e2181b150a08267d4ffbf3304d72ca5e914b81d2/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lauren readying her pigfiteroles.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lauren readying her pigfiteroles.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cShall we get a plate for each of you so you can mud up?\u201d Kim-Joy asks.</p> <p>Tair dishes up a bold puddle and plops his four little piggies down in a row. Rowan plates hers first then dribbles and flings the melted chocolate with Jackson Pollock-style abandon. Lauren\u2019s plate is minimalist, with the chocolate poured into a smooth pool and the piglets huddled at its edge.</p> <p>The three of them take a moment to smudge their anxious brows and appraise. Nabil brings round a tray of cheese sarnies. Everyone tucks in. Competitive baking is hungry work.</p> <h2><strong>Iced ginger biscuits</strong></h2> <p>Kim-Joy conquered spice week with a show-stopping chandelier made of these beauties. Today, she has prepped the dough ahead of time (a salted butter, black treacle and muscovado mixture, spiced with cinnamon and cloves). \u201cWhat do you guys fancy decorating?\u201d she asks as she tips out two entire boxes of cookie-cutters on the floor and uncovers a basket of food dyes.</p> <p>They settle on cacti and llamas. Tair opts for egg-yolk yellow, Lauren, cerise pink and Rowan, a light and a dark forest green. Kim-Joy takes a selfie with the bakers and their piping bags just as a butterfly flies up to the door.</p> <p>\u201cCan things possibly get cuter?\u201d I whisper softly to no one in particular. The contestants get decorating.</p> <p>Kim-Joy hands out toothpicks for fixing holes \u2013 or \u201cfor wiggling\u201d, as she puts it \u2013 and candy rocks, sprinkles and shimmer pearls. \u201cOh, I got some eyes, too, if you want to make it crazy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDammit, no, wasp, not right now,\u201d says Rowan as yet another stripy inspector takes an interest in her sugar work.</p> <p>Lauren is wiggling, too, bent over the kitchen counter as if her life depends on it. She oozes precision, commitment and focus, as she delicately pokes the icing to create a prickly texture. She dots her succulents with white-icing thorns and sets them in a bed of coloured rock-sugar topsoil.</p> <p>Meanwhile, I fear Tair has stopped breathing again. He smothers his three cacti and lone llama in yellow, then bejewels the lot with red, pink and brown blooms.</p> <p>There is half an hour to go and everyone suddenly realises that, contrary to GBBO tradition, no one has been calling out timings. The whole day has unspooled without the slightest glitch, largely because Kim-Joy is a master of time management.</p> <p>Tair is the first to finish, so we have a bit of a chinwag. How is the book going to develop? \u201cWell,\u201d he says, \u201cI need to work out the recipes. And it will involve a celebrity chef who is also an elephant. A bit Jamie Oliver, a bit Gordon Ramsay. He\u2019s a bit of an ego, but gets brought down to size.\u201d </p> <h2><strong>Judging</strong></h2> <p>Time is up. Kim-Joy looks nervous for the first time. She says she wants everyone to win.</p> <p>She was up at 1am (the jetlag) baking a biscuit medal for the winner. \u201cIt\u2019s the worst thing I\u2019ve ever decorated,\u201d she insists, then disappears upstairs to deliberate, yelling down for Nabil to bring up her edible pens which she has stashed in her pen pot.</p> <p>Downstairs, the bakers and I catch up. It transpires that none of them knew this would be a Kim-Joy event: this wasn\u2019t about the celeb factor. No, it was, is and always will be \u2013 for each of them \u2013 about the baking. And the day has not let them down. They have relished the fine decorating, the communal baking and being part of a team.</p> <p>Kim-Joy comes back down with books, pin badges and that biggest, kindest of smiles. She announces the winner. Lauren! That final procession of colourful cacti set on a bed of edible sediment seems to have been the deciding factor.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ef9cdda2760ffcf2ede75ac8b9b796891e7981f7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ef9cdda2760ffcf2ede75ac8b9b796891e7981f7/0_324_6582_3949/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Victorious Lauren with her edible medal, and Kim-Joy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Victorious Lauren with her edible medal, and Kim-Joy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The beautiful biscuit medal falls off its green ribbon instantly, which gives her permission to dig right in and eat it. Lauren, Tair and Rowan finally taste their wares.</p> <p>The table looks like a Technicolor feast. The photographer, Chris, can\u2019t quite believe what they have accomplished. Kim-Joy has loved baking with the trio so much that Nabil suspects she may want to do this every weekend.</p> <p>There\u2019s no doubt in my sugar-sated mind that all three are potential star bakers and each has a chance at a Paul Hollywood handshake.

Nabil brings round a tray of cheese sarnies. Everyone tucks in. Competitive baking is hungry work. Iced ginger biscuits Kim-Joy conquered spice week with a show-stopping chandelier made of these beauties. Today, she has prepped the dough ahead of time (a salted butter, black treacle and muscovado mixture, spiced with cinnamon and cloves). \u201cWhat do you guys fancy decorating?\u201d she asks as she tips out two entire boxes of cookie-cutters on the floor and uncovers a basket of food dyes. They settle on cacti and llamas. Tair opts for egg-yolk yellow, Lauren, cerise pink and Rowan, a light and a dark forest green. Kim-Joy takes a selfie with the bakers and their piping bags just as a butterfly flies up to the door. \u201cCan things possibly get cuter?\u201d I whisper softly to no one in particular. The contestants get decorating. Kim-Joy hands out toothpicks for fixing holes \u2013 or \u201cfor wiggling\u201d, as she puts it \u2013 and candy rocks, sprinkles and shimmer pearls. \u201cOh, I got some eyes, too, if you want to make it crazy.\u201d \u201cDammit, no, wasp, not right now,\u201d says Rowan as yet another stripy inspector takes an interest in her sugar work. Lauren is wiggling, too, bent over the kitchen counter as if her life depends on it. She oozes precision, commitment and focus, as she delicately pokes the icing to create a prickly texture. She dots her succulents with white-icing thorns and sets them in a bed of coloured rock-sugar topsoil. Meanwhile, I fear Tair has stopped breathing again. He smothers his three cacti and lone llama in yellow, then bejewels the lot with red, pink and brown blooms. There is half an hour to go and everyone suddenly realises that, contrary to GBBO tradition, no one has been calling out timings. The whole day has unspooled without the slightest glitch, largely because Kim-Joy is a master of time management. Tair is the first to finish, so we have a bit of a chinwag. How is the book going to develop? \u201cWell,\u201d he says, \u201cI need to work out the recipes. And it will involve a celebrity chef who is also an elephant. A bit Jamie Oliver, a bit Gordon Ramsay. He\u2019s a bit of an ego, but gets brought down to size.\u201d Judging Time is up. Kim-Joy looks nervous for the first time. She says she wants everyone to win. She was up at 1am (the jetlag) baking a biscuit medal for the winner. \u201cIt\u2019s the worst thing I\u2019ve ever decorated,\u201d she insists, then disappears upstairs to deliberate, yelling down for Nabil to bring up her edible pens which she has stashed in her pen pot. Downstairs, the bakers and I catch up. It transpires that none of them knew this would be a Kim-Joy event: this wasn\u2019t about the celeb factor. No, it was, is and always will be \u2013 for each of them \u2013 about the baking. And the day has not let them down. They have relished the fine decorating, the communal baking and being part of a team. Kim-Joy comes back down with books, pin badges and that biggest, kindest of smiles. She announces the winner. Lauren! That final procession of colourful cacti set on a bed of edible sediment seems to have been the deciding factor. The beautiful biscuit medal falls off its green ribbon instantly, which gives her permission to dig right in and eat it. Lauren, Tair and Rowan finally taste their wares. The table looks like a Technicolor feast. The photographer, Chris, can\u2019t quite believe what they have accomplished. Kim-Joy has loved baking with the trio so much that Nabil suspects she may want to do this every weekend. There\u2019s no doubt in my sugar-sated mind that all three are potential star bakers and each has a chance at a Paul Hollywood handshake. Get yourselves signed up for the TV show sharpish: the country\u2019s cuppa\u2019s getting cold. Baking with Kim-Joy is published by Quadrille on 22 August and is available for pre-order from guardianbookshop.com",

The chief executive of Independent Schools Victoria said this \u201cis entirely unremarkable\u201d.</p> <p>Government overfunding frees up millions in fees and donations from wealthy families to install more and more opulent facilities. Many elite private schools around Australia have been massively over-funded by governments for 20 years or more. For example, <a href=\"https://docs.education.gov.au/documents/2018-funding-figures-approved-authorities\">data released under FOI</a> show that several Sydney private schools were over-funded by millions in 2018, including Loreto Kirribilli ($5.8m), Monte Sant\u2019 Angelo Mercy ($5.6m), St. Augustine\u2019s ($4.7m), Barker College ($2.9m) and Sydney Grammar ($1.3m). Many in other states are similarly over-funded.</p> <p>A key problem is that there is no standard to ensure all children are educated in appropriate facilities. A national standard for recurrent resourcing of schools called the Schooling Resource Standard was introduced following the Gonski report in 2011. The report also recommended the development of a national standard for school infrastructure for both public and private schools, but it was rejected by the Gillard government.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/feb/07/special-deals-swindling-public-schools-out-of-billions-new-analysis-says\">Special deals 'swindling' public schools out of billions, new analysis says</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Private schools get recurrent and capital funding from the commonwealth, but public schools only get recurrent funding. The Gonski report recommended that the capital grants program for private schools be extended to public schools. It said the commonwealth should provide equivalent capital funding for public schools as for private schools with adjustment for the larger enrolment share of public schools. It said that public schools need additional funding to bring their infrastructure up to a quality that enables them to effectively compete with private schools. This was also rejected by the Gillard government.</p> <p>The Coalition government continues to increase capital funding of private schools. Department of Education figures supplied to Senate Estimates in 2017 show they will get $1.9bn in capital funding from 2018 to 2027. There is no equivalent capital funding for public schools.</p> <p>Government funding for elite private schools is a waste of taxpayer funds. Their fees and donations alone far exceed the average income of public schools. Government funding just adds to their massive resource advantage and indirectly funds their gold-plated facilities. It denies much-needed resources for disadvantaged public schools facing severe shortages in teaching staff, educational materials and modern classroom buildings and equipment.</p> <p>\u2022 Trevor Cobbold is the national convenor of <a href=\"http://saveourschools.com.au/\">Save Our Schools</a></p>",

Many elite private schools around Australia have been massively over-funded by governments for 20 years or more. For example, data released under FOI show that several Sydney private schools were over-funded by millions in 2018, including Loreto Kirribilli ($5.8m), Monte Sant\u2019 Angelo Mercy ($5.6m), St. Augustine\u2019s ($4.7m), Barker College ($2.9m) and Sydney Grammar ($1.3m). Many in other states are similarly over-funded. A key problem is that there is no standard to ensure all children are educated in appropriate facilities. A national standard for recurrent resourcing of schools called the Schooling Resource Standard was introduced following the Gonski report in 2011. The report also recommended the development of a national standard for school infrastructure for both public and private schools, but it was rejected by the Gillard government. Private schools get recurrent and capital funding from the commonwealth, but public schools only get recurrent funding. The Gonski report recommended that the capital grants program for private schools be extended to public schools. It said the commonwealth should provide equivalent capital funding for public schools as for private schools with adjustment for the larger enrolment share of public schools. It said that public schools need additional funding to bring their infrastructure up to a quality that enables them to effectively compete with private schools. This was also rejected by the Gillard government. The Coalition government continues to increase capital funding of private schools. Department of Education figures supplied to Senate Estimates in 2017 show they will get $1.9bn in capital funding from 2018 to 2027. There is no equivalent capital funding for public schools. Government funding for elite private schools is a waste of taxpayer funds. Their fees and donations alone far exceed the average income of public schools. Government funding just adds to their massive resource advantage and indirectly funds their gold-plated facilities. It denies much-needed resources for disadvantaged public schools facing severe shortages in teaching staff, educational materials and modern classroom buildings and equipment. \u2022 Trevor Cobbold is the national convenor of Save Our Schools",

The male started to ferret into her feathers, trying to get around her and mount, but she held her rear end over the edge of the box, proving that gravity was the best form of contraception.

The next morning, and every morning thereafter, collared doves were back on the rooftops, trading coos with woodpigeons. It was a dawn chorus made for two, for no other bird in early August has any reason to challenge their monotonous aural supremacy. And the doves had regained their spring wings, fired up to flirt, court and mate. As the sun climbed in the sky, so too did the doves, making swooping display flights, wings fanned out, plumage pale October grey against remorseless blue. A pair of doves found themselves a mid-morning platform for canoodling, the sloping lid of a starling nest box under the eaves, where they wedged themselves together. The male launched into a lusty summons to the faraway female squatting right by his side. Standing behind the veil of the net curtain at my window, less than a metre away, I could hear subtleties of timbre and pitch in his simple three-note song. The second note took on a sandpapery rasp halfway through, the final note caught as a sharp intake of breath. I watched his female give chicken-like thrusts of her head to the north, south and east, as if jerking to his \u201ccu coo-cu\u201d beat, or thinking about how to escape the din. After three mornings of cosying up, the male\u2019s song changed. It was apt to descend, the strident, straining first \u201ccu\u201d sinking four or five notes lower. Now the pair began billing instead of cooing, rubbing neck to neck and touching beaks with slow tenderness. The male started to ferret into her feathers, trying to get around her and mount, but she held her rear end over the edge of the box, proving that gravity was the best form of contraception. Each encounter ended with one of the pair launching off in an audible whirr of wings and the other flying in pursuit. On the last day, the male brought presents. Four sticks still sit on the lid of the box, a nest that was not to be.",

      "bodyText": "The global mining giant Glencore has failed in an attempt to force the Australia Taxation Office to surrender Paradise Papers documents which it claimed would breach the secrecy of communications with its lawyers. On Wednesday the high court unanimously ruled that legal professional privilege does not grant Glencore a right to stop use of the documents, which the tax office told the court it needed to assess the mining giant\u2019s tax obligations. Victory for Glencore would have represented a major break with the rest of the common law world and created alarm among regulators, who are already angry at the use of legal professional privilege to stop documents being unearthed during investigations. The case concerned legal advice on the Project Everest corporate restructure provided by the premier offshore law firm Appleby, obtained as part of the Paradise Papers investigation in November 2017, including plans to move billions of dollars of assets into offshore structures. The Paradise Papers also revealed that Glencore\u2019s Australian arm had been involved in cross-currency swaps of up to $25bn of a type under investigation by the ATO. The swaps, although lawful, are being investigated as a means for companies to shift profits from high-tax to low-tax jurisdictions by use of unrealistic, non-commercial exchange rates. ATO second commissioner Jeremy Hirschhorn said it would have been \u201cperverse\u201d for the court to find the ATO could not use information already in the public domain. \u201cToday\u2019s decision is not just a win for the ATO; it\u2019s a win for the Australian community who rightly expect the ATO to use all information available to ensure large corporations and those who seek to hide money overseas are paying the right amount of tax,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce we have information we can\u2019t just ignore it \u2013 we are obliged to use all relevant information we have.\u201d Glencore has previously told the Australian Financial Review that Project Everest was a simplification process \u201cto streamline Glencore\u2019s industrial assets ownership\u201d, which \u201cdid not improve Glencore\u2019s tax position\u201d. \u2022 Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning It had argued that the doctrine of legal professional privilege \u2013 which generally operates defensively as a means for resisting compulsory production \u2013 should extend to preventing the tax office from using legal advice which had been released either unintentionally or through hacking. The tax office responded that legal professional privilege \u201cdoes not, and has never\u201d granted a right to stop it using the papers, and that the Income Tax Assessment Act required it to use the documents even if it knew them to be privileged. Under the act, the commissioner of taxation must use tax returns and \u201cany other information\u201d in his or her possession to work out how much tax is owed. In a unanimous judgment the court held that legal professional privilege \u201cis only an immunity from the exercise of powers which would otherwise compel the disclosure of privileged communications\u201d, rejecting the claim it is \u201ca legal right which is capable of being enforced\u201d.

There\u2019s something deep down and spiritual about it and I want to connect to it. I\u2019m American, and I believe in this structure that we have, but I\u2019m emotionally and spiritually tied to Africa now that I know where I came from.\u201d</p> <p>By the early 17th century <a href=\"https://nmaahc.si.edu/slavery-and-freedom\">the transatlantic slave trade</a> \u2013 the biggest forced migration of people in world history \u2013 was already well under way in the Caribbean and Latin America. In 1619 it came to the English colony of Virginia. The San Juan Bautista, a Spanish ship transporting enslaved Africans, was bound for Mexico when it was attacked by the White Lion and another privateer, the Treasurer, and forced to surrender its African prisoners.</p> <p>The White Lion continued on to land at Point Comfort. John Rolfe, a colonist, reported that its cargo was \u201cnot anything but 20 and odd Negroes, which the Governor and Cape Merchant bought for victualls\u201d. They were given names by Portuguese missionaries: Antony, Isabela, William, Angela, Anthony, Frances, Margaret, Anthony, John, Edward, Anthony and others, according to research by the <a href=\"https://hampton.gov/3585/1619-Landing\">Hampton History Museum.</a></p> <p>The captain of the White Lion, John Jope, traded the captives to Virginians in return for food and supplies. They were taken into servitude in nearby homes and plantations, their skills as farmers and artisans critical in the daily struggle to survive. Slavery in America was born.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"77a62970ce4c9ae08247e108e93dbbb347beb59f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/77a62970ce4c9ae08247e108e93dbbb347beb59f/0_0_3000_2067/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Terry Brown, the first African American superintendent at Fort Monroe national monument, stands by a 500-year-old tree which he calls the Witness Tree.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"689\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Terry Brown, the first African American superintendent at Fort Monroe national monument, stands by a 500-year-old tree which he calls the Witness Tree.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Evelyn Hockstein/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet it all requires a leap of imagination in the serenity of today\u2019s 565-acre <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/fomr/index.htm\">Fort Monroe </a><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/fomr/index.htm\">national </a><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/fomr/index.htm\">monument,</a> run by the National Park Service, or in the low-key city of Hampton, home to Nasa\u2019s Langley Research Center.</p> <p>Brown, the first black superintendent at Fort Monroe, said: \u201cThe early colonists are trying to survive and they\u2019re not doing it. They\u2019re resorting to cannibalism because they just can\u2019t figure this thing out. When the Africans show up, the game changes a little bit because they knew how to cultivate rice, sugar and cotton, all those things were perfect for this environment and for what they were trying to do.\u201d</p> <p>It would be another century until the formation of the United States<strong>. </strong>By 1725, some 42,200 enslaved Africans had been transported to the Chesapeake; by 1775, the total was 127,200. Thomas Jefferson, the author of the declaration of independence, which contains the words \u201call men are created equal\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/18/america-complicated-history-slavery-thomas-jefferson-monticello-virginia\">was a Virginia slave owner</a> and, by 1860, the US was home to <a href=\"https://www2.census.gov/library/publications/decennial/1860/population/1860a-02.pdf\">about 3.9 million enslaved African Americans.</a></p> <p>The events of 1619 are at once both remote and immediate in a state where white nationalists caused deadly violence in Charlottesville two years ago and in a nation where their enabler occupies the White House.</p> <p>Brown reflected: \u201cAfrican Americans make up about 13% of the population and our young black men account for about 49% of America\u2019s murders. People who look like me, about 41% of them are sitting in a jail cell. Now I can easily blame that on one thing but I can easily tie it to the very beginning of this country. It\u2019s so easy to treat other people like they\u2019re less than human if you don\u2019t know them. So what I\u2019m hoping this 400th will do is raise the awareness level.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re not going to change people\u2019s behaviour overnight but maybe if you sit back and think, \u2018man, 400 years\u2019, they were enslaved for 246 years so they lived under the most oppressive conditions imaginable but they managed to reinvent themselves \u2026They created new music and new art forms and new families.

He\u2019s for white supremacy, he\u2019s for nationalism, he\u2019s for everything that we are against.\u201d</p> <p>Built by enslaved labour, the fort has a multilayered history, full of contradiction and paradox, like America itself. It witnessed the beginning of slavery but also the end: early in the civil war, three enslaved men seeking freedom escaped to Fort Monroe and were deemed by the commander as \u201ccontraband of war\u201d, spurring thousands to seek sanctuary behind Union lines and ultimately a shift in government policy towards emancipation.</p> <p>There are other threads from past to present. Among the Africans who arrived on the White Lion were Anthony and Isabela who, in 1624 or 1625, had a son, William, who was baptised. In a census they are identified as \u201cAntoney Negro: Isabell Negro: and William theire Child Baptised.\u201d They were living on the property of Captain William Tucker, so are now known by this surname, and William is often described as the first African child born in English North America.</p> <p>A local family in Hampton <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/retropolis/wp/2018/08/24/slaverys-bitter-roots-in-1619-20-and-odd-negroes-arrived-in-virginia/\">believe they are his direct descendants.</a> Walter Jones, 63, whose mother is the oldest living Tucker, said: \u201cWe traced as far as we could and then we had word-of-mouth records.

It was going on everywhere so it was unfortunate and in some cases Africans were also involved in some of the slave trade.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s more discord to not being recognised as being such a vital part of our history and our nation\u2019s history here and what was contributed. We didn\u2019t come here by choice but we chose to excel and to build a country which wasn\u2019t our own. So sometimes I think not having that type of recognition makes you a little bitter. If it hasn\u2019t come by now, when will it? And now that it\u2019s 400 years coming up, how many people truly will even recognise that?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"70b553a8e39ac2adf0d290335a60f95f8d200182\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/70b553a8e39ac2adf0d290335a60f95f8d200182/0_0_3000_1976/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Tucker family cemetery has more than 104 markers, with burials dating to the 1800s.

      "bodyText": "The blue waters of the Chesapeake lap against the shore. Sunbathers lounge in deckchairs as black children and white children run and play on the beach. And close by stands a magnificent oak tree, its trunk stretching three great arms and canopies of leaves high into the tranquil sky. Over half a millennium, the Algernoune Oak has witnessed war and peace and the fall of empires, but never a day like the one in late August 1619. It was here that the White Lion, a 160-ton English privateer ship, landed at what was then known as Point Comfort. On board were more than 20 captives seized from the Kingdom of Ndongo in Angola and transported across the Atlantic. This dislocated, unwilling, violated group were the first enslaved Africans to set foot in English North America \u2013 ushering in the era of slavery in what would become the United States. This site, now Fort Monroe in Hampton, southern Virginia, will host a weekend of 400th anniversary commemorations on 23-25 August, culminating in a symbolic release of butterflies and nationwide ringing of bells. Americans of all races will reflect on a historical pivot point that illuminates pain and suffering but also resilience and reinvention. Some see an opportunity for a national reckoning and debate on reparations. For a people robbed of an origins story, it is also an invitation to go in search of roots \u2013 the African in African American. \u201cOnce I learned that I was from there it changed something in me,\u201d said Terry E Brown, 50, who has traced his ancestry to Cameroon and enslaved people in Virginia and North Carolina. \u201cI have a fire in me to just learn about why and who I am. There\u2019s something deep down and spiritual about it and I want to connect to it. I\u2019m American, and I believe in this structure that we have, but I\u2019m emotionally and spiritually tied to Africa now that I know where I came from.\u201d By the early 17th century the transatlantic slave trade \u2013 the biggest forced migration of people in world history \u2013 was already well under way in the Caribbean and Latin America. In 1619 it came to the English colony of Virginia. The San Juan Bautista, a Spanish ship transporting enslaved Africans, was bound for Mexico when it was attacked by the White Lion and another privateer, the Treasurer, and forced to surrender its African prisoners. The White Lion continued on to land at Point Comfort. John Rolfe, a colonist, reported that its cargo was \u201cnot anything but 20 and odd Negroes, which the Governor and Cape Merchant bought for victualls\u201d. They were given names by Portuguese missionaries: Antony, Isabela, William, Angela, Anthony, Frances, Margaret, Anthony, John, Edward, Anthony and others, according to research by the Hampton History Museum. The captain of the White Lion, John Jope, traded the captives to Virginians in return for food and supplies. They were taken into servitude in nearby homes and plantations, their skills as farmers and artisans critical in the daily struggle to survive. Slavery in America was born. Yet it all requires a leap of imagination in the serenity of today\u2019s 565-acre Fort Monroe national monument, run by the National Park Service, or in the low-key city of Hampton, home to Nasa\u2019s Langley Research Center. Brown, the first black superintendent at Fort Monroe, said: \u201cThe early colonists are trying to survive and they\u2019re not doing it. They\u2019re resorting to cannibalism because they just can\u2019t figure this thing out. When the Africans show up, the game changes a little bit because they knew how to cultivate rice, sugar and cotton, all those things were perfect for this environment and for what they were trying to do.\u201d It would be another century until the formation of the United States. By 1725, some 42,200 enslaved Africans had been transported to the Chesapeake; by 1775, the total was 127,200. Thomas Jefferson, the author of the declaration of independence, which contains the words \u201call men are created equal\u201d, was a Virginia slave owner and, by 1860, the US was home to about 3.9 million enslaved African Americans. The events of 1619 are at once both remote and immediate in a state where white nationalists caused deadly violence in Charlottesville two years ago and in a nation where their enabler occupies the White House. Brown reflected: \u201cAfrican Americans make up about 13% of the population and our young black men account for about 49% of America\u2019s murders. People who look like me, about 41% of them are sitting in a jail cell. Now I can easily blame that on one thing but I can easily tie it to the very beginning of this country. It\u2019s so easy to treat other people like they\u2019re less than human if you don\u2019t know them. So what I\u2019m hoping this 400th will do is raise the awareness level. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to change people\u2019s behaviour overnight but maybe if you sit back and think, \u2018man, 400 years\u2019, they were enslaved for 246 years so they lived under the most oppressive conditions imaginable but they managed to reinvent themselves \u2026They created new music and new art forms and new families. It\u2019s one of the greatest stories and it\u2019s amazing that they survived it.\u201d Last month, Donald Trump travelled to nearby Jamestown to celebrate the 400th anniversary of the first representative legislative assembly. The US president made reference to the first enslaved Africans\u2019 arrival in Virginia, \u201cthe beginning of a barbaric trade in human lives\u201d, but there are currently no plans for him to attend the commemoration at Fort Monroe. Gaylene Kanoyton, the president of the Hampton branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), said: \u201cHe\u2019s not welcome because of everything that we\u2019re commemorating, the arrival of slavery. He\u2019s for white supremacy, he\u2019s for nationalism, he\u2019s for everything that we are against.\u201d Built by enslaved labour, the fort has a multilayered history, full of contradiction and paradox, like America itself. It witnessed the beginning of slavery but also the end: early in the civil war, three enslaved men seeking freedom escaped to Fort Monroe and were deemed by the commander as \u201ccontraband of war\u201d, spurring thousands to seek sanctuary behind Union lines and ultimately a shift in government policy towards emancipation. There are other threads from past to present. Among the Africans who arrived on the White Lion were Anthony and Isabela who, in 1624 or 1625, had a son, William, who was baptised. In a census they are identified as \u201cAntoney Negro: Isabell Negro: and William theire Child Baptised.\u201d They were living on the property of Captain William Tucker, so are now known by this surname, and William is often described as the first African child born in English North America. A local family in Hampton believe they are his direct descendants. Walter Jones, 63, whose mother is the oldest living Tucker, said: \u201cWe traced as far as we could and then we had word-of-mouth records. We heard this years and years ago and so a lot of us have been through family history and we just never realized how significant it was. From what we\u2019re able to dig up, everything still points to that.\u201d Jones and his relatives maintain a two-acre cemetery in the historic African American neighborhood of Aberdeen Gardens in Hampton, where many of their ancestors are buried. A simple grey monument is inscribed with the words: \u201cTucker\u2019s cemetery. First black family. 1619.\u201d A short distance away, a headstone says, \u201cAfrican American female. Approx age 60. Discovered July 2017.\u201d Dozens of white crosses dot patches of grass and soil representing unmarked graves. Can Jones, a retired software engineer, forgive the enslavers? \u201cThe way we were raised and the way I was raised is that we forgive all for some of the things that were done because it wasn\u2019t just them. It was going on everywhere so it was unfortunate and in some cases Africans were also involved in some of the slave trade. \u201cThere\u2019s more discord to not being recognised as being such a vital part of our history and our nation\u2019s history here and what was contributed. We didn\u2019t come here by choice but we chose to excel and to build a country which wasn\u2019t our own. So sometimes I think not having that type of recognition makes you a little bitter. If it hasn\u2019t come by now, when will it? And now that it\u2019s 400 years coming up, how many people truly will even recognise that?\u201d The Tuckers are not alone. The anniversary coincides with a boom in online and TV genealogy.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump played Santa Claus on Tuesday, telling reporters he was delaying tariffs on Chinese imports to avoid any adverse impact on US shoppers before the festive season. \u201cWe\u2019re doing this for the Christmas season,\u201d Trump told reporters as he left New Jersey for an event in Pittsburgh. The move triggered a rally on Wall Street, sending the Dow Jones up 372 points, or 1.4%, by the close. Shares of Apple, Mattel and shoe brand Steve Madden shot up. Asian stocks followed suit on Wednesday with the Shanghai Composite index rising 0.6%. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng, which has been hurt by disruptions from large anti-government protests, rose 0.5%. while the Kospi advanced 0.8% in Seoul and the Nikkei was up 0.6% in Tokyo. Grateful shoppers, however, should not leave purchases of Chinese-made cellphones, laptops, video game consoles, some toys, computer monitors, shoes and clothing until the last minute. The Office of the US Trade Representative (USTR) said it would delay tariffs on such goods until 15 December, 10 days before Christmas. The USTR also said it was still planning 10% tariffs on about $300bn in Chinese imports, extending the import taxes on just about everything China ships to the US, as part of a dispute over Beijing\u2019s aggressive trade policies. Most of the levies are scheduled to kick in on 1 September. The USTR action was published minutes after China\u2019s ministry of commerce said vice-premier Liu He conducted a call with US officials. It said talks with trade representative Robert Lighthizer and treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin would occur again in two weeks\u2019 time. Kenta Inoue, senior market economist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities in Tokyo, pointed out that Trump\u2019s tariff delay came just as US stocks were stalling. \u201cThis appears to be a routine ploy by the US president, who applies trade pressure on China when stocks are doing well and opts for compromise when they are not,\u201d Inoue said.

According to lists published by the USTR, a broad category of items taken off a $200bn tariff list last year will be subject to the 10% tariff as of 1 September. Popular products on the list include smart watches made by Apple and Fitbit, smart speakers from Amazon and Apple and Alphabet\u2019s Google and Bluetooth connected devices. The dispute between the world\u2019s two biggest economies has rattled financial markets for more than a year and clouded the global economy. The US and China are fighting over US allegations that Beijing steals trade secrets and forces foreign companies to hand over technology, as part of a drive to become a world leader in advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence and electric cars. \u201cIts unlikely that there\u2019s going to be major deal but we might start to see some small concessions on both sides,\u201d Tom Plumb, chief investment officer of Plumb Funds, told Reuters. \u201cIt\u2019ll be good maybe for this week as we kind of get out of an oversold situation but the market is going to bounce around for the rest of the year.\u201d As news of the tariff delay broke, Trump used Twitter to complain that China had not followed through with expected large purchases of US agricultural products. \u201cAs usual, China said they were going to be buying \u2018big\u2019 from our great American Farmers.

They\u2019re using experts to rehab or just to \u201cget ahead of stuff\u201d. The NRL offers every player six free confidential sessions. Today the average young professional footballer is well-equipped to deal with abuse that comes with the territory.</p> <p>They\u2019d want to be. According to his wife, Tanyssa, McGuire has received \u201cdeath threat upon death threat, countless threats of the most unthinkable things\u201d. She wrote on her Instagram page: \u201cMental health is constantly being spoken about within the NRL and yet what I am witnessing is the absolute bashing of a man who can only take so much before that thick skin starts to soften.\u201d</p> <p>Turn off the phone? Or is it better to call it out? Roosters\u2019 centre Latrell Mitchell was racially abused on his Instagram page by a person who said they hoped Mitchell broke his neck. Mitchell\u2019s father Matthew \u2013 who came to Sydney as a young man to play rugby league and enjoyed effectively zero per cent of the support his son can access today \u2013 was in tears.</p> <p>Latrell Mitchell, though, in highlighting the racism and abuse has emerged stronger for it. He has called it out and risen above it. The vast majority of sports fans \u2013 like the vast majority of human beings \u2013 despise racism, bullying and vilification. Not everyone calls it out.</p> <p>While the NRL\u2019s \u201cSummer from Hell\u201d so damaged the code that clubs which didn\u2019t even have poorly-behaved players struggled to retain sponsors because their brands were tarnished by association, the players themselves \u2013 with Manly\u2019s one-time bad-boy Joel Thompson, 30, at the vanguard \u2013 have reached, dare we say it, a level of enlightenment.</p> <p>The 20-something men who play rugby league seem to have reached the point where they\u2019re comfortable talking with peers and professionals about their mental health. Like tattoos and tight pants, the new normal is that it\u2019s cool to get help.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/09/afl-takes-lead-on-mental-health-issues-in-positive-if-long-overdue-move\">AFL takes lead on mental health issues in positive if long overdue move | Kirby Fenwick</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.playersvoice.com.au/joel-thompson-hope-from-unimaginable-pain/#b9Ia1ypTS1LigtZv.97\">As Thompson once wrote</a>: \u201cIt\u2019s just like any physical injury.

Your mental health is just as important as your physical health and it\u2019s important to get out there and take care of it and do the right things.\u201d</p> <p>Being constantly pushed by punters online has forged solidarity among the playing group. Post-match handshakes are meetings of old mates. There are large groups who hold post-match prayers. Sam Thaiday\u2019s tattoo reads: \u201cOne brother bleeds, all brothers bleed.\u201d All players have copped degrees of abuse, be it online or over the parapets.</p> <p>The NRL and the Rugby League Players Association have great swathes of accessible information to help players be better people.

Today the average young professional footballer is well-equipped to deal with abuse that comes with the territory. They\u2019d want to be. According to his wife, Tanyssa, McGuire has received \u201cdeath threat upon death threat, countless threats of the most unthinkable things\u201d. She wrote on her Instagram page: \u201cMental health is constantly being spoken about within the NRL and yet what I am witnessing is the absolute bashing of a man who can only take so much before that thick skin starts to soften.\u201d Turn off the phone? Or is it better to call it out? Roosters\u2019 centre Latrell Mitchell was racially abused on his Instagram page by a person who said they hoped Mitchell broke his neck. Mitchell\u2019s father Matthew \u2013 who came to Sydney as a young man to play rugby league and enjoyed effectively zero per cent of the support his son can access today \u2013 was in tears. Latrell Mitchell, though, in highlighting the racism and abuse has emerged stronger for it. He has called it out and risen above it. The vast majority of sports fans \u2013 like the vast majority of human beings \u2013 despise racism, bullying and vilification. Not everyone calls it out. While the NRL\u2019s \u201cSummer from Hell\u201d so damaged the code that clubs which didn\u2019t even have poorly-behaved players struggled to retain sponsors because their brands were tarnished by association, the players themselves \u2013 with Manly\u2019s one-time bad-boy Joel Thompson, 30, at the vanguard \u2013 have reached, dare we say it, a level of enlightenment. The 20-something men who play rugby league seem to have reached the point where they\u2019re comfortable talking with peers and professionals about their mental health. Like tattoos and tight pants, the new normal is that it\u2019s cool to get help. As Thompson once wrote: \u201cIt\u2019s just like any physical injury. You have to go treat it. Your mental health is just as important as your physical health and it\u2019s important to get out there and take care of it and do the right things.\u201d Being constantly pushed by punters online has forged solidarity among the playing group. Post-match handshakes are meetings of old mates. There are large groups who hold post-match prayers. Sam Thaiday\u2019s tattoo reads: \u201cOne brother bleeds, all brothers bleed.\u201d All players have copped degrees of abuse, be it online or over the parapets. The NRL and the Rugby League Players Association have great swathes of accessible information to help players be better people. And if McGuire, perhaps the most old school member of the fraternity, can seek help from a professional, not only can young players use him as a role model, but all young men. It\u2019s well-documented that suicide is the leading killer of men aged between 15 and 44. Stories such as this always feature contacts for organisations if people are struggling. And if the NRL can hang a hat on one thing, it\u2019s that McGuire may have encouraged one young man to think, if that tough mad bastard does it, why not me too?

Here's what I want you to know | Ranjana Srivastava</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I remember every bit of your innocent face, your pensive expression, the body language that spoke of your sadness but also your determination to make the journey with your parents because it was the right thing to do. Sometimes you came in your school uniform, sometimes not \u2013 it all depended on the vagaries of the appointment system that I am afraid wasn\u2019t set up to cater to your needs. But you came nevertheless, part of a tight family unit that threatened to break before not too long. Sometimes I made small talk, hoping to pull you into the decidedly medical circle. How was school?

You were quiet and courteous, determined to hold it together. </p> <p><em>You have many patients, but I hope you recall treating my mum.</em></p> <p>I do. To this day, I remember the cubicle in the emergency department where I told your parents that her back pain and weight loss were a result of advanced cancer. She was stunned. But I am young, she said, and I have never been sick in my life. Did they switch the scans, your dad puzzled. No, I replied gently. This happens. Bad luck just happens. I will do my best to treat you. At this, your mum politely asked if she could seek a second opinion. I told her I\u2019d want to do the same. Days later, she returned. I am going to put my trust in your hands, she said.I feigned confidence and pushed my dread aside.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>To you, we must all be the same, a patient once said to me.

I told her I agreed. Shortly afterwards, she slipped away. Your dad had showed enormous fortitude but now he said that he lacked the strength to continue on his own. He wanted to move to the city of your grandparents, and who could blame him? But I felt privately conflicted. I cared about your bereaved dad, but I had grown especially fond of you for your precocious dignity and composure through an unimaginably difficult time. With your mum gone, I wanted you to remain in the embrace of your old school, your good friends, the parents of those friends. But parenting is hard work, harder still when a single parent feels on shaky ground. So, when your dad and you came for a final time to say thank you and goodbye, I met your gaze and quietly said: \u201cYou\u2019ll do well wherever you go. Get in touch if you ever need a hand.\u201d</p> <p><em>It took me time, but now I am a medical student.</em></p> <p>I have often wondered if the experience of your childhood left you inspired or damaged.

There are newer drugs now, but the patient experience may not have changed that much. I can\u2019t help wondering whether the image of your mum in every patient will spur you on or hold you back. However, I will say that some of the best doctors I know are people who have first-hand experience of the vicissitudes of life.</p> <p><em>I know you must be very busy, but can I sit with you in clinic one day?</em></p> <p>I was hoping you\u2019d just want to talk to me about a life in medicine and we could get by on generalities.

I didn\u2019t feel safe in those theatres last week, but as a white person I would have been far less at risk. Minutes ahead of the massacre in El Paso, which killed 22 people, the 21-year-old white gunman is believed to have posted a hate-filled manifesto which echoed the anti-immigrant and racist rhetoric that has been shared by President Donald Trump throughout his time in office. \u201cWhite Replacement Theory\u201d \u2013 which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/05/great-replacement-theory-alt-right-killers-el-paso\">continues to motivate white nationalism and domestic terrorism</a> \u2013 is brought into Sorkin\u2019s Mockingbird overtly: half a century after the civil war, Bob Ewell and his daughter Mayella are still terrified that black people are taking over. \u201cIt\u2019s the race traitors I can\u2019t abide,\u201d Ewell threatens Atticus, who reminds him that actually, as always, white people are doing just fine.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f6b5ffb7012eb7712c409b302d7c4f0ffa022a55\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f6b5ffb7012eb7712c409b302d7c4f0ffa022a55/393_452_4961_2976/1000.jpg\" alt=\"MaYaa Boateng in Jackie Sibblies Dury\u2019s Fairview.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">MaYaa Boateng in Jackie Sibblies Dury\u2019s Fairview.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julieta Cervantes</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But it was Jackie Sibblies Drury\u2019s Pulitzer prize-winning play Fairview which brought the most startling, confronting moment of theatre I have ever experienced. The play begins innocuously, as we meet the middle-class black family at the centre of the drama, but before too long \u2013 through <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/07/theater/fairview-ending-debate.html\">a series of startling narrative devices</a> \u2013 white members of the audience are forced to reckon with the gaze and privilege they continue to enjoy at the expense of others. By the end, when Keisha (played by the brilliant MaYaa Boateng) stared each of us down, daring us to trade places with her, I was shaking with shame.</p> <p>Theatre is most powerful when it responds to what\u2019s happening around it; when it forces us into new positions of empathy and challenges how we see ourselves in the world. None of this is new. After the 2016 Orlando shooting \u2013 the 133rd mass shooting in that year alone (it was only June) \u2013 the Hamilton performance at the Tony awards removed guns from its choreography, with the actors miming holding the rifles instead. The show\u2019s choreographer, Andy Blankenbuehler, <a href=\"http://www.playbill.com/article/breaking-hamilton-amends-tony-performance-in-light-of-orlando-tragedy\">explained why they had made that call</a>: \u201c[The song] Battle of Yorktown is the first time the American forces ever put guns in their hands [in Hamilton] \u2026 The moment of putting them down is actually one of my favourite moments in the show.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s our America today,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt\u2019s not taking up arms; it\u2019s wanting to put them down.\u201d</p>",

Minutes ahead of the massacre in El Paso, which killed 22 people, the 21-year-old white gunman is believed to have posted a hate-filled manifesto which echoed the anti-immigrant and racist rhetoric that has been shared by President Donald Trump throughout his time in office. \u201cWhite Replacement Theory\u201d \u2013 which continues to motivate white nationalism and domestic terrorism \u2013 is brought into Sorkin\u2019s Mockingbird overtly: half a century after the civil war, Bob Ewell and his daughter Mayella are still terrified that black people are taking over. \u201cIt\u2019s the race traitors I can\u2019t abide,\u201d Ewell threatens Atticus, who reminds him that actually, as always, white people are doing just fine. But it was Jackie Sibblies Drury\u2019s Pulitzer prize-winning play Fairview which brought the most startling, confronting moment of theatre I have ever experienced. The play begins innocuously, as we meet the middle-class black family at the centre of the drama, but before too long \u2013 through a series of startling narrative devices \u2013 white members of the audience are forced to reckon with the gaze and privilege they continue to enjoy at the expense of others. By the end, when Keisha (played by the brilliant MaYaa Boateng) stared each of us down, daring us to trade places with her, I was shaking with shame. Theatre is most powerful when it responds to what\u2019s happening around it; when it forces us into new positions of empathy and challenges how we see ourselves in the world. None of this is new. After the 2016 Orlando shooting \u2013 the 133rd mass shooting in that year alone (it was only June) \u2013 the Hamilton performance at the Tony awards removed guns from its choreography, with the actors miming holding the rifles instead. The show\u2019s choreographer, Andy Blankenbuehler, explained why they had made that call: \u201c[The song] Battle of Yorktown is the first time the American forces ever put guns in their hands [in Hamilton] \u2026 The moment of putting them down is actually one of my favourite moments in the show. \u201cThat\u2019s our America today,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt\u2019s not taking up arms; it\u2019s wanting to put them down.\u201d",

Contractors across multiple countries reported hearing \u201cupsetting, or possibly criminal\u201d recordings, they told the organisation.</p> <p>In July, the Belgian public news channel VRT <a href=\"https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/en/2019/07/10/google-employees-are-eavesdropping-even-in-flemish-living-rooms/\">revealed that Google carried out the same quality control</a>, after a contractor leaked more than 1,000 audio clips to the channel. Almost 15% of the recordings had been made accidentally, and some contained sensitive personal information. Google paused the practice after the voice clips were leaked, and a German data protection commission forced the company\u2019s hiatus to be extended to a minimum of three months.</p> <p>Just a week later, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jul/26/apple-contractors-regularly-hear-confidential-details-on-siri-recordings\">the Guardian revealed that Apple carried out the same practice</a>, \u201cgrading\u201d Siri by having humans contractors listen to recordings. At the time, Apple said: \u201cA small portion of Siri requests are analysed to improve Siri and Dictation. User requests are not associated with the user\u2019s Apple ID. Siri responses are analysed in secure facilities and all reviewers are under the obligation to adhere to Apple\u2019s strict confidentiality requirements.\u201d</p> <p>Although the company insisted its voice assistant was more privacy-conscious than Amazon\u2019s or Google\u2019s, due to its practice of uploading the recordings without linking them to an Apple ID, rather than keeping them all in the cloud as part of the users\u2019 account, it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/aug/02/apple-halts-practice-of-contractors-listening-in-to-users-on-siri\">announced it was pausing the human grading a week later</a>. The company told the Guardian that it was \u201csuspending Siri grading globally\u201d, while it conducted a \u201cthorough review. Additionally, as part of a future software update, users will have the ability to choose to participate in grading.\u201d</p> <p>In August, Amazon, the first to be reported using human oversight, eventually followed Google and Apple in pushing changes to its program, offering users the ability to explicitly opt out by disabling a setting labelled \u201chelp improve Amazon services and develop new features\u201d <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/alexaprivacysettings\">on the Alexa privacy page</a>.</p> <p>Finally, last week, <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/xweqbq/microsoft-contractors-listen-to-skype-calls\">Vice News caught Microsoft in the same trap</a>, revealing that human contractors were being used to carry out quality assurance on recordings for the company\u2019s Cortana voice assistant, as well as for voice conversations carried out over Skype if the app\u2019s translation feature are turned on.</p> <p>Human oversight of supposedly automated systems is common within the tech industry. But voice speakers and chat programs carried a significantly higher level of concern over privacy, which left all the companies struggling to match user expectations with their actual practices.</p> <p>Voice assistants can be accidentally triggered, mishearing ambient noise, homophones or, in the case of Apple\u2019s Siri, \u201cthe sound of a zip\u201d as their \u201cwake words\u201d, resulting in them recording and transmitting audio without a direct command. Those accidental triggers led to some of the most egregious violations of privacy, as contractors reported hearing personally identifiable information, medical consultations and couples having sex, in the process of carrying out their work.</p> <p>Similarly, the transcription and translation services offered by Skype and Facebook Messenger capture far more personal information than users could have expected would be played back to a human stranger, including, again, full addresses, job interviews, and \u201cstuff [that] could clearly be described as phone sex\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/xweqbq/microsoft-contractors-listen-to-skype-calls\">according to one contractor</a>.</p> <p>The Information Commissioner\u2019s Office in the UK has said it is investigating whether the undisclosed use of human oversight has breached the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). \u201cWe are aware of privacy concerns relating to voice assistant programs and will be assessing the available information,\u201d a spokesperson said, adding that the regulate would meet with its European colleague \u201cin order to ascertain the full facts and any possible risks to the rights of UK residents\u201d.</p> <p>Ireland\u2019s Data Protection Commissioner, which oversees Apple and Google, said \u201cwe will be making our assessments and conclusions\u201d about the practice. \u201cWe note that both companies have ceased this processing.\u201d</p> <p>In late July, the US congressman Seth Moulton <a href=\"https://moulton.house.gov/news-stories/press-releases/moulton-alexa-act-protects-consumers-digital-eavesdropping-in-speakers-doorbells-digital-assistants/\">introduced a bill called the Automatic Listening Exploitation Act</a> that would empower the Federal Trade Commission to issue fines of up to $40,000 each time digital personal assistants and smart doorbells record private conversations of users who haven\u2019t said the device\u2019s wake word or phrase or activated the doorbell.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Facebook has become the latest company to admit that human contractors listened to recordings of users without their knowledge, a practice the company now says has been \u201cpaused\u201d. Citing contractors who worked on the project, Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday that the company hired people to listen to audio conversations carried out on Facebook Messenger. The practice involved users who had opted in Messenger to have their voice chats transcribed, the company said. The contractors were tasked with re-transcribing the conversations in order to gauge the accuracy of the automatic transcription tool. \u201cMuch like Apple and Google, we paused human review of audio more than a week ago,\u201d a Facebook spokesperson told the Guardian. Facebook is the fourth major company to have been exposed using humans to listen in on audio recordings that users expected would only ever be heard by an artificial intelligence. In April, Bloomberg revealed that Amazon was using humans as part of the quality assurance for Alexa, the company\u2019s personal assistant. Contractors across multiple countries reported hearing \u201cupsetting, or possibly criminal\u201d recordings, they told the organisation. In July, the Belgian public news channel VRT revealed that Google carried out the same quality control, after a contractor leaked more than 1,000 audio clips to the channel. Almost 15% of the recordings had been made accidentally, and some contained sensitive personal information. Google paused the practice after the voice clips were leaked, and a German data protection commission forced the company\u2019s hiatus to be extended to a minimum of three months. Just a week later, the Guardian revealed that Apple carried out the same practice, \u201cgrading\u201d Siri by having humans contractors listen to recordings. At the time, Apple said: \u201cA small portion of Siri requests are analysed to improve Siri and Dictation. User requests are not associated with the user\u2019s Apple ID. Siri responses are analysed in secure facilities and all reviewers are under the obligation to adhere to Apple\u2019s strict confidentiality requirements.\u201d Although the company insisted its voice assistant was more privacy-conscious than Amazon\u2019s or Google\u2019s, due to its practice of uploading the recordings without linking them to an Apple ID, rather than keeping them all in the cloud as part of the users\u2019 account, it announced it was pausing the human grading a week later. The company told the Guardian that it was \u201csuspending Siri grading globally\u201d, while it conducted a \u201cthorough review. Additionally, as part of a future software update, users will have the ability to choose to participate in grading.\u201d In August, Amazon, the first to be reported using human oversight, eventually followed Google and Apple in pushing changes to its program, offering users the ability to explicitly opt out by disabling a setting labelled \u201chelp improve Amazon services and develop new features\u201d on the Alexa privacy page. Finally, last week, Vice News caught Microsoft in the same trap, revealing that human contractors were being used to carry out quality assurance on recordings for the company\u2019s Cortana voice assistant, as well as for voice conversations carried out over Skype if the app\u2019s translation feature are turned on. Human oversight of supposedly automated systems is common within the tech industry. But voice speakers and chat programs carried a significantly higher level of concern over privacy, which left all the companies struggling to match user expectations with their actual practices. Voice assistants can be accidentally triggered, mishearing ambient noise, homophones or, in the case of Apple\u2019s Siri, \u201cthe sound of a zip\u201d as their \u201cwake words\u201d, resulting in them recording and transmitting audio without a direct command. Those accidental triggers led to some of the most egregious violations of privacy, as contractors reported hearing personally identifiable information, medical consultations and couples having sex, in the process of carrying out their work. Similarly, the transcription and translation services offered by Skype and Facebook Messenger capture far more personal information than users could have expected would be played back to a human stranger, including, again, full addresses, job interviews, and \u201cstuff [that] could clearly be described as phone sex\u201d, according to one contractor. The Information Commissioner\u2019s Office in the UK has said it is investigating whether the undisclosed use of human oversight has breached the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). \u201cWe are aware of privacy concerns relating to voice assistant programs and will be assessing the available information,\u201d a spokesperson said, adding that the regulate would meet with its European colleague \u201cin order to ascertain the full facts and any possible risks to the rights of UK residents\u201d. Ireland\u2019s Data Protection Commissioner, which oversees Apple and Google, said \u201cwe will be making our assessments and conclusions\u201d about the practice. \u201cWe note that both companies have ceased this processing.\u201d In late July, the US congressman Seth Moulton introduced a bill called the Automatic Listening Exploitation Act that would empower the Federal Trade Commission to issue fines of up to $40,000 each time digital personal assistants and smart doorbells record private conversations of users who haven\u2019t said the device\u2019s wake word or phrase or activated the doorbell.",

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Kirsten Gillibrand announced that she\u2019ll be holding a reproductive rights town hall in Missouri, where only one abortion provider remains open. Pete Buttigieg unveiled an ambitious plan to transform the economy of rural America. Stacey Abrams, the former gubernatorial candidate from Georgia presented a new multi-million dollar initiative to protect voters in battleground states across the country. Abrams, who had been floated as a potential presidential candidate, announced she will not be joining the 2020 race. The Justice Department announced it had reassigned the warden of the Metropolitan correctional center following Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s apparent suicide. Two other jail employees have been placed on administrative leave. Trump predicted the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong will \u201cwork out\u201d, while acknowledging it is a \u201cvery tough situation\u201d. The president also acknowledged that his proposed tariffs on Chinese imports could affect US consumers\u2019 holiday shopping, contradicting his past false claims that Americans were not bearing the cost of his trade war. His comments came hours after his administration announced that some of the Chinese tariffs set to go into effect on 1 September would actually be delayed until 15 December, causing US markets to rally after yesterday\u2019s losses. Kirsten Gillibrand announced she\u2019ll be holding a reproductive rights town hall in visiting St Louis, Missouri on Sunday. \u201cThis is an emergency, and we need to fix it,\u201d tweeted the New York senator and 2020 presidential candidate. A new law in the state bans most abortions in at the eighth week of pregnancy. The restrictions have been challenged in federal court and have yet to take effect, but other policies have already severely restricted access to abortions. Women seeking to terminate their pregnancy in Missouri are must undergo a 72-hour waiting period and counseling intended to discourage abortion. And due to other policies, only one licensed abortion provider in the state remains open. Pete Buttigieg unveiled an $80bn proposal to bring high-speed internet access to rural Americans. The 2020 candidate also announced his intention to invest $50bn to help farmers combat climate change over the next decade, and proposed dramatic increases to teacher pay in a wide-ranging plan to boost the economy of rural America. Buttigieg is one of 20 presidential candidates looking to woo voters at the Iowa State Fair. Congressman Kevin McCarthy, the Republican minority leader of the House, has expressed support for the protestors in Hong Kong. Lawmakers from both political parties have expressed support for the pro-democracy protestors. John Hickenlooper is considering ending his 2020 presidential bid and entering the race for Colorado\u2019s Republican-held Senate seat, the New York Times is reporting. Hickenlooper, who served as the governor of Colorado from 2011 to 2019, is unlikely to qualify for the next round of presidential debates in September. The Times reports that he discussed changing tracks with Michael Bennet, who himself is a 2020 presidential candidate and currently Colorado\u2019s Democratic senator. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York has reportedly been asking Hickenlooper to enter the senate race for months. If he does choose to redirect his focus, Hickenlooper could be a key player in Democrats\u2019 efforts to retake senate from the Republicans. California senator Dianne Feinstein says she supports her state\u2019s efforts to fight the Trump administration\u2019s policy of denying permanent residence to immigrants who have ever received public assistance. The Trump administration announced yesterday a new policy of denying green cards to people who have legally immigrated to the US if they ever accepted food stamps, housing assistance, Medicaid or other forms of government assistance. The new rules, which would take effect mid-October, would also subject immigrants seeking permanent status to a wealth test, to establish if they have enough money to support themselves and their families. California\u2019s San Francisco and Santa Clara counties filed a lawsuit today challenging the rules, arguing that the changes would increase public health risks and financially harm the counties. The newly announced policy \u201cturns our back on the immigration that\u2019s been the fabric of our nation,\u201d Feinstein said in a statement. This morning, Ken Cuccinelli, the acting director of US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), proposed an edit to the famous poem on Statue of Liberty, which currently reads: \u201cGive me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.\u201d On NPR\u2019s Morning Edition he offered: \u201cGive me your tired and your poor who can stand on their own two feet and who will not become a public charge.\u201d \u201cWe are going to fight to make sure every voice is heard,\u201d said Stacy Abrams announcing a new initiative called Fair Fight 2020 at the IUPAT convention in Las Vegas. Abrams said she\u2019s leaving it to others to get voters excited to cast their ballots in the upcoming election, confirming that she won\u2019t be running for president. Instead, she will work in battleground states to help strengthen voter protections ahead of next year\u2019s general election. The effort will cost between $4m and $5m, according to the Washington Post, and will target 20 states. That\u2019s it from me today. My west coast colleague Maanvi Singh will be taking over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: The former Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams has decided she will not run for president, instead focusing on a national voting rights initiative. The Justice Department announced it had reassigned the warden of the Metropolitan correctional center following Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s apparent suicide. Two other jail employees have been placed on administrative leave. Trump predicted the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong will \u201cwork out\u201d, while acknowledging it is a \u201cvery tough situation\u201d. \u201cI hope it works out for everybody, including China, by the way,\u201d Trump told reporters before traveling to Pennsylvania. Trump also acknowledged that his proposed tariffs on Chinese imports could affect US consumers\u2019 holiday shopping, contradicting his past false claims that Americans were not bearing the cost of his trade war. The president\u2019s comments came hours after his administration announced that some of the Chinese tariffs set to go into effect on 1 September would actually be delayed until 15 December, causing US markets to rally after yesterday\u2019s losses. Maanvi will have more on Abrams\u2019 decision and the Hong Kong protests, so stay tuned. Stacey Abrams has been floated as a possible candidate for multiple offices since she narrowly lost her 2018 gubernatorial race in Georgia. She announced back in April that she would not run against Republican Senator David Perdue, despite extensive lobbying from Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer. \u201cThe fights to be waged require a deep commitment to the job, and I do not see the U.S. Senate as the best role for me in this battle for our nation\u2019s future,\u201d Abrams said in a video announcing her decision. But some have speculated she may seek a rematch against Republican Governor Brian Kemp when he comes up from re-election in 2022. The news that Stacey Abrams will not run for president comes as the former Democratic gubernatorial candidate prepares to elevate her voting rights initiative to a national level. The Washington Post reports: The initiative, called Fair Fight 2020, takes its name from the organization that the Georgia Democrat founded last year after narrowly losing her bid to become the nation\u2019s first black female governor. Abrams is set to announce the program Tuesday during a speech at the convention of the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades in Las Vegas. Abrams, 45, who for the past several months has said she was considering a bid for president, will instead focus on helping Democratic Party leaders and activists in 20 states to immediately begin building systems to make sure their voters have minimal problems casting ballots and that those ballots are counted. Former Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams has decided not to pursue a White House bid after toying with the idea for months. The New York Times reports: Ms. Abrams will instead put her efforts into preventing voter suppression, including working with state parties in battleground states to more closely monitor voter protection ahead of next year\u2019s general election. The move comes after civil rights groups raised questions about voter suppression and election rigging in Ms. Abrams\u2019 2018 race against Brian Kemp, a Republican who was Georgia\u2019s secretary of state. Ms. Abrams is set to speak Tuesday afternoon at the at the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades Convention in Las Vegas. She is likely to remain atop any Democratic nominee\u2019s vice-presidential wish list. ... Ms. Abrams made her decision in recent days, aides said, as she decided she is comfortable with current crop of Democratic candidates. Authorities in Dayton delivered an update on the investigation into the recent mass shooting that left 10 dead, including the gunman. Among the victims was the shooter\u2019s 22-year-old sister, and Dayton Police Chief Richard Biehl said there is still significant disagreement among investigators whether he intended to kill her or if she was simply caught in the spray of gunfire. Authorities also updated the casualty count from the shooting, clarifying that nine victims were shot and killed by the attacker and another 17 were wounded by gunshots. The police chief added that there is no indication any disagreement occurred to set off the shooter. \u201cThis was a plan well before he got to the Oregon District,\u201d Biehl said. The investigations into the circumstances surrounding Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s apparent suicide have been stymied by federal employees who have been hesitant to cooperate. An administration source told NBC News that some federal employees have been \u201clawyering up\u201d as three different investigations into Epstein\u2019s death unfold. Justice Department rules say all employees \u201chave a duty to, and shall, cooperate fully\u201d with the probes, but anyone can still invoke their Fifth Amendment rights to avoid questions.lly Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg shared this awkward exchange with a voter in Iowa after speaking at the state fair, per a CNN reporter: Several reporters who accompanied Trump on his official White House trip to Pennsylvania have noted that the president has veered into decidedly political territory during the visit. He has repeatedly attacked his Democratic rivals and claimed (without any evidence) that the presidency has cost him billions of dollars. A day before the Metropolitan Correctional Center\u2019s warden was reassigned, Attorney General William Barr voiced concern about \u201cserious irregularities\u201d in Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s confinement at the jail. \u201cWe are now learning of serious irregularities at this facility that are deeply concerning and demand a thorough investigation,\u201d Barr said in a New Orleans speech yesterday. \u201cWe will get to the bottom of what happened.\u201d Reports have emerged that one of the guards who was watching Epstein was not actually a full-fledged correctional officer and that the alleged sex-trafficker was left alone for several hours before his body was discovered. The Justice Department announced in a statement that Attorney General William Barr has reassigned the warden of the Metropolitan Correctional Center as investigations continue into the circumstances surrounding Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s apparent suicide. \u201cToday, the Attorney General directed the Bureau of Prisons to temporarily assign the warden at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York to the Bureau\u2019s Northeast Regional Office pending the outcome of the FBI and OIG investigations into the apparent suicide of Jeffrey Epstein, a former MCC inmate,\u201d DOJ spokesperson Kerri Kupec said in a statement. \u201cFCI Otisville Warden James Petrucci has been named Acting Warden of the MCC New York. The Bureau of Prisons also placed on administrative leave two MCC staff assigned to Mr. Epstein\u2019s unit pending the outcome of the investigations. Additional actions may be taken as the circumstances warrant.\u201d Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had a conversation in New York today with Yang Jiechi, a top Chinese official, in a previously unannounced meeting. The readout from the meeting does not explain what the two officials discussed amid an escalating trade war and intensifying Hong Kong protests, per our colleague Julian Borger: Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg is en route to the Iowa State Fair, where he will soon be speaking at the Des Moines Register Political Soapbox. The Indiana mayor will be in the early voting state for three days starting today and has just released a plan aimed at helping rural America. Trump has landed in Pennsylvania for a tour of the Shell Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex and is tweeting about the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. It wasn\u2019t totally clear what \u201cmany\u201d people Trump was referring to, although a number of commentators across the political spectrum have called on the administration to more strongly express solidarity with the pro-democracy demonstrators. Trump also said US intelligence had informed him of Chinese troop movements near the Hong Kong border, but China\u2019s own state media outlets have released footage of those developments: Trump told reporters that Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell wants to \u201cdo something\u201d to expand the background checks system. The president said just before departing New Jersey for a Pennsylvania event that he\u2019s \u201cconvinced that Mitch wants to do something.\u201d He added, \u201cHe wants to do background checks and I do too.\u201d But when Trump said last week that McConnell was \u201ctotally on board\u201d with taking action on gun legislation, the Senate leader\u2019s team gently pushed back by noting he had not committed to any specific proposal. The question of whether congressional Republicans will act will likely come down to whether Trump decides to use the full force of his bully pulpit to demand change. Given the president\u2019s past commitments to expanding background checks after other mass shootings, there is heavy skepticism that he will do so. Trump told reporters that his administration chose to delay some tariffs on Chinese imports \u201cjust in case\u201d the policy would negatively impact US consumers\u2019 holiday shopping. \u201cWe\u2019re doing this for the Christmas season,\u201d Trump told reporters in New Jersey before boarding Air Force One for an event in Pennsylvania. \u201cJust in case some of the tariffs would have an impact on U.S. customers.\u201d The comment was unusual for Trump, who has consistently pushed the false claim that China would bear the cost of his trade war. But the president quickly added that he has seen no indication the tariffs have affected American consumers. \u201cBut so far they\u2019ve had virtually none,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut just in case they might have an impact on people, what we\u2019ve done is we\u2019ve delayed it, so that they won\u2019t be relevant to the Christmas shopping season.\u201d US retailers have warned that the tariffs could hurt their businesses, and there are early signs that companies are taking down job postings to brace for the impact of Trump\u2019s trade war. Despite the massive flight cancellations at Hong Kong\u2019s airport, travelers are still arriving as the clashes between pro-democracy protesters and police escalate, CNN reports. Hong Kong officials have cautioned passengers against coming to the airport, but some travelers \u2014 who have been unable to leave the country for two days \u2014 have ignored those warnings in the hope of catching one of the few flights that are taking off. The protests in Hong Kong have turned increasingly violent as pro-democracy demonstrators clash with police wielding pepper spray and batons. The Washington Post reports: Later in the evening, a group of demonstrators ... seized a man they suspected to be an undercover Chinese police officer, cable-tied his hands and refused to let him through a large crowd. The incident showed increasing brazenness on the part of demonstrators in confronting what they perceive as symbols of the Chinese state. Police entered the airport to help the man, whom paramedics tried to remove on a stretcher. The presence of officers sparked chaos, as protesters spilled out of the airport and began attacking police vans with officers inside. At one point, an officer was overrun and his baton taken by protesters, who beat him with it. The group retreated only after the officer appeared to pull his gun from its holster. Trump told reporters in New Jersey that the protests in Hong Kong were a \u201cvery tough situation,\u201d but he predicted that it would \u201cwork out.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll what see what happens,\u201d Trump said before boarding Air Force One for an event in Pennsylvania. \u201cBut I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll work out. I hope it works out for everybody, including China, by the way.\u201d Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: The Hong Kong protests appear to be escalating. US politicians from both parties have voiced support for the pro-democracy protesters, but Trump has focused his tweeting this morning on mocking CNN host Chris Cuomo and bashing the New York Times. The Trump administration announced some of the tariffs on Chinese imports, which were set to go into effect on Sept. 1, would be delayed until Dec. 15. Certain goods would be excluded from the tariffs altogether. US markets rallied after the policy shift was announced. The Democratic attorneys general of Massachusetts and California pledged to sue the Trump administration over its planned overhaul of the Endangered Species Act. The blog is covering the latest developments from Hong Kong and Trump\u2019s trade war, so stay tuned. Clashes between pro-democracy protesters and police appear to be escalating at the Hong Kong airport. As the face-off intensifies, US politicians from both parties have voiced support for the protesters. From Trump\u2019s former UN ambassador: From the Democratic House speaker: And from former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton: Ken Cuccinelli, the acting director of US Citizenship and Immigration Services, is facing criticism and mockery for offering an edited version of the poem that appears on a plaque at the Statue of Liberty. Our colleague Edward Helmore reports: The famous lines, taken from The New Colossus by the 19th-century New York poet Emma Lazarus, read: \u2018Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.\u2019 In a radio interview on Tuesday, Cuccinelli offered a change: \u2018Give me your tired and your poor who can stand on their own two feet and who will not become a public charge.\u2019 On NPR\u2019s Morning Edition, Cuccinelli defended the Trump administration decision to make it harder for migrants to be awarded permanent residence, or a \u2018green card\u2019, if they have ever accepted benefit programs such as food stamps, housing assistance or Medicaid. Many critics of the new \u201cpublic charge rule\u201d have cited the Statue of Liberty poem to argue that the policy goes against American values, including the mayor of Seattle: A Democratic congressman, Representative Ted Lieu of California, struck back against Trump\u2019s false claim that China would bear the cost of the president\u2019s trade war: Lieu\u2019s tweet came as the Trump administration announced some of the tariffs on Chinese imports, set to go into effect on Sept. 1, would be delayed until Dec. 15. Democratic presidential candidate Juli\u00e1n Castro has released a new ad responding to attacks from Trump against him and his brother, Representative Joaquin Castro. \u201cPresident Trump: You referred to countries as shitholes. You urged American Congresswomen to \u2018go back to where they came from.\u2019 You called immigrants rapists,\u201d Castro says in the ad. He goes on to link Trump to the recent shooting in El Paso, which left 22 people dead. \u201cAs we saw in El Paso, Americans were killed because you stoked the fire of racists. Innocent people were shot down because they look different from you. Because they look like me. They look like my family. Words have consequences.\u201d The ad is clearly meant to incite a response from Trump, given that it will air tomorrow during Fox News programming in Bedminster, New Jersey \u2014 where the president is currently on vacation. Trump went on a Twitter tirade against the Castro brothers last week, after Representative Joaquin Castro shared a list of the president\u2019s donors in his congressional district. Some of Trump\u2019s allies accused the congressman, who chairs his brother\u2019s presidential campaign, of \u201cdoxxing\u201d the supporters \u2014 even though he shared no private information. \u201cI don\u2019t know who Joaquin Castro is other than the lesser brother of a failed presidential candidate (1%) who makes a fool of himself every time he opens his mouth,\u201d Trump tweeted last Wednesday. \u201cJoaquin is not the man that his brother is, but his brother, according to most, is not much. Keep fighting Joaquin!\u201d The ad also comes as Castro fights to make the cut for the September debate stage. He has already crossed the donor threshold and needs only one more qualifying poll to participate. Democratic presidential candidate Tom Steyer announced his campaign has hit the donor threshold required to qualify for the fall debates. Steyer has also registered at 2 percent or higher in three qualifying polls, leaving him just one shy of making the debate stage. As Steyer\u2019s campaign noted in a statement, the billionaire activist has surpassed other candidates who entered presidential race months before he did. \u201cSince entering the race five weeks ago, our priority has been getting Tom\u2019s message out to the American people,\u201d said campaign manager Heather Hargreaves. \u201cTom reaching this milestone just five weeks into his campaign is proof that his message is resonating with people across the country.\u201d Nine Democratic candidates have already made the cut for the next round of debates, and Juli\u00e1n Castro similarly remains one poll away from qualifying. But the dozen or so other candidates have a lot of ground to cover if they want to participate next month. The Dow closed down nearly 400 points yesterday amid mounting concerns about Trump\u2019s trade war. After his administration announced the delay of some tariffs on Chinese imports, all of those losses were recouped. It\u2019s worth noting that Trump frequently brags about the strength of the stock market during his presidency. It has become a key talking point for him on the campaign trail, and he does not likely want to give it up \u2014 even for the sake of his trade war. The Trump administration was facing backlash over its proposed tariffs from US business owners, some of whom had taken down job postings after the policy was announced. The Washington Post reports: Trump\u2019s escalating trade war has spooked business executives. There\u2019s already been a noticeable decline in business investment as corporate leaders say Trump\u2019s tariffs and unpredictability are creating too much uncertainty, dissuading them from spending large sums on new buildings or equipment. Now there are early signs that business leaders are beginning to pull back on hiring, too. ... The United States had 7.3 million job openings in June, down from a peak of 7.6 million in November, according to the latest Labor Department data. While the decline is modest, economists are concerned hiring could dry up quickly as companies see no end in sight to Trump\u2019s trade war and they look to cut costs. The reduction in job openings is also widespread across many industries, signaling how cautious companies are becoming. Just this morning, Trump was falsely claiming that China would bear the cost of his trade war. But the decision to delay some of Trump\u2019s tariffs until Dec. 15 indicates that certain members of his administration understand the burden US consumers will face once this trade policy goes into effect. The news of the delayed tariffs on items like cell phones, laptops and video game consoles will certainly come as a relief to US retailers, who have expressed concerns that Trump\u2019s trade war could impact holiday sales. But as a Politico reporter noted, the administration\u2019s decision to delay the policy appears to fly in the face of Trump\u2019s repeated (and false) claim that American consumers will not bear the cost of his tariffs. The Trump administration also announced that certain Chinese imports would no longer be subject to the 10 percent tariff. \u201cCertain products are being removed from the tariff list based on health, safety, national security and other factors and will not face additional tariffs of 10 percent,\u201d the statement from US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer notes. The tariffs were originally set to go into effect on Sept. 1 and impact $300 billion worth of Chinese imports. Robert Lighthizer, the US trade representative, announced today that some of the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs against China will be delayed until Dec. 15. \u201cProducts in this group include, for example, cell phones, laptop computers, video game consoles, certain toys, computer monitors, and certain items of footwear and clothing,\u201d the statement from Lighthizer\u2019s office reads. That means that US consumers likely won\u2019t face increased prices until after the holidays, as all of those products will have already been shipped from China by Dec. 15. The Dow spiked 400 points on news of the delayed tariffs, which were set to go into effect on Sept. 1. Continuing to mock Chris Cuomo for lashing out against a heckler, Trump oddly suggested the CNN host shouldn\u2019t be allowed to carry a gun. Red flag laws have been enacted in a number of US states and allow judges to take away firearms from those deemed dangerous. But Trump has sent mixed signals about whether he backs such laws. Bernie Sanders might have finally found something he and Trump can agree on: the alleged bias of the Washington Post. Without citing any evidence, the presidential candidate claimed the newspaper was giving him negative coverage because of his criticisms of Amazon. (The retail giant\u2019s founder, Jeff Bezos, owns the Post.) Speaking at a town hall in New Hampshire, Sanders brought up Amazon\u2019s low tax bill. \u201cSee, I talk about that all of the time,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cAnd then I wonder why The Washington Post \u2014 which is owned by Jeff Bezos, who owns Amazon \u2014 doesn\u2019t write particularly good articles about me. I don\u2019t know why. But I guess maybe there\u2019s a connection. Maybe we helped raise the minimum wage at Amazon to 15 bucks an hour as well.\u201d The Post reported last month on conflicts between the unionized organizers of Sanders\u2019 campaign and senior staffers. The organizers were complaining that their salaries equated to an hourly pay of less than $15, which the senator has long said should be the federal minimum wage. The president has previously attacked the newspaper as the \u201cAmazon Washington Post\u201d and falsely claimed that the outlet is working as a lobbyist for Bezos\u2019 company. The Post\u2019s executive editor, Marty Baron, issued a statement denying Sanders\u2019 claim. \u201cSen. Sanders is a member of a large club of politicians \u2014 of every ideology \u2014 who complain about their coverage,\u201d Baron said. \u201cContrary to the conspiracy theory the senator seems to favor, Jeff Bezos allows our newsroom to operate with full independence, as our reporters and editors can attest.\u201d Another member of the National Rifle Association\u2019s board of directors has resigned, the fourth such departure in the past two weeks. Professional sport shooter Julie Golob published a letter to her website announcing her resignation. \u201cI am proud to have had the opportunity to represent the members of the National Rifle Association but I can no longer commit to fulfilling the duties of a director,\u201d she wrote. She also apologized for not completing her three-year term and noted that it was \u201cnot a decision I made lightly.\u201d Golob\u2019s departure is the latest sign of upheaval at the gun lobbying group, which has been pushing back against the expansion of background checks or red flag laws in the wake of the El Paso and Dayton shootings. The NRA\u2019s president, Oliver North, was fired earlier this year, and its top lobbyist resigned after becoming embroiled in an alleged scheme to oust CEO Wayne LaPierre. Gun-control groups celebrated the signs of trouble at the organization. \u201cNow another board member is calling it quits,\u201d said John Feinblatt, president of the group Everytown for Gun Safety. \u201cAt this rate, they may be answering subpoenas rather than paying for political ads in 2020.\u201d Trump has joined in on the discussion about Chris Cuomo after the CNN anchor lashed out against a man who called him \u201cFredo,\u201d referring to the dimmer-witted son of Vito Corleone in \u201cThe Godfather.\u201d \u201cPunk ass bitches from the right call me \u2018Fredo.\u2019 My name is Chris Cuomo, I\u2019m an anchor on CNN,\u201d Cuomo told his heckler in a video shared on Twitter last night. \u201cFredo is from the \u2018Godfather,\u2019 he was a weak brother and the use of it to an Italian is disparaging.\u201d After the video emerged, Cuomo\u2019s network stood by him, with a CNN spokesperson saying, \u201cWe completely support him.\u201d Cuomo even got some support from another cables news host and a frequent critic of his, Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity. But Trump was much less compassionate, echoing the heckler\u2019s use of \u201cFredo\u201d and saying Cuomo \u201ctotally lost it.\u201d Good morning, live blog readers! The Trump administration is already facing pushback for two significant policy changes announced yesterday. One would penalize green card applicants who use public benefits, and the other would overhaul the Endangered Species Act in ways that critics fear will accelerate the extinction of many plants and animals. Massachusetts and California have announced that they will go to court in an effort to prevent the changes to the landmark conservation bill. \u201cWe will not let the Administration attack our most rare animals and plants,\u201d Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey said. \u201cWe are suing.\u201d Both attorneys general cited a United Nations report from earlier this year estimating that more than 1m species across the globe face the threat of extinction. The dire warnings provided the latest demonstration of how far-reaching \u2013 and potentially devastating \u2013 the impacts of Donald Trump\u2019s policies could be. Here\u2019s what else the blog is keeping its eye on: Trump will travel to Pennsylvania today to tour the Shell Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex and give a speech on energy policy. Judging from his Twitter feed, he is currently watching Fox and Friends. Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg will speak at the Iowa State Fair. National security adviser John Bolton is still in London meeting with UK officials. That\u2019s all still coming up, so stay tuned.",
