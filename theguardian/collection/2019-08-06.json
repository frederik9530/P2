      "bodyText": "An NHS pension \u201ctax trap\u201d blamed for deterring senior doctors and nurses from taking on additional shifts for fear of being hit with hefty tax bills are to be overhauled, ministers have announced. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, said the move would ensure senior clinicians in England and Wales fully benefited from any extra work they took on. However, some hospital doctors warned that the NHS was already facing \u201ca full-blown winter meltdown\u201d as a result of the crisis caused by the pension rules, while other experts cautioned that further reform was needed. Rule changes introduced in 2016 meant rising numbers of consultants and other senior staff were facing unexpected tax bills linked to the value of their pensions. Operations and clinics were cancelled as NHS senior staff withdrew from working extra shifts that would put them in the pension penalty zone. The fiasco was blamed for an increase in waiting times and led to cancer scans going unread for as long as six weeks. Some NHS staff were reported to have had to remortgage their homes to cover their tax bills, while others were faced with the choice of cutting their hours, opting out of the pension scheme, or taking early retirement. In a joint statement the Department for Health and Social Care (DHSC) and the Treasury said the changes would provide an \u201cimmediate solution\u201d for experienced doctors and nurses facing sizeable tax rises in the current financial year. The DHSC will also shortly publish a consultation document proposing wide-ranging \u201cflexibilities\u201d to the pension scheme to ensure that from the next financial year, frontline staff can remain in it without fear of financial penalty. The move was welcomed by the British Medical Association (BMA), which has been leading the campaign to get the rules changed, as a \u201cstep forward\u201d. However the HCSA union, representing hospital doctors, warned that it would not be sufficient to prevent a \u201cwinter meltdown\u201d in the NHS. \u201cIt is fantasy to pretend that a little bit more flexibility, or distant promises of a Treasury review, will reverse the current descent into chaos within our hospitals,\u201d said the president, Dr Claudia Paoloni. \u201cWe are heading for a full-blown winter meltdown as a result of the government\u2019s inaction on the NHS pensions crisis.

It gradually reduced the allowance for those on high incomes, meaning they were more likely to suffer an annual tax charge on contributions and a lifetime allowance tax charge on their benefits. Under the new changes, senior staff will be able to decide their level of pension accrual at the start of each year, enabling them to select a level which gives them the \u201cheadroom\u201d to take on additional work without breaching their annual allowance. Their employers would then have the option to recycle their unused contribution back into their salary. At the same time, the Treasury will carry out a review of the way the tapered allowance operates \u201cto support the delivery of public services such as the NHS\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "The scale of the challenge UK broadcasters face in the streaming era has been thrown into stark relief by a new report, which estimates that 34 extra series of the BBC hit Bodyguard \u2013 or 14 more Love Islands \u2013 would have needed to air last year to make up for the drop in traditional TV viewing as audiences flock to rivals including Netflix, Amazon and YouTube. The report, by the media regulator Ofcom, highlights the huge growth in popularity of streaming services in the UK. The number of subscribers to the three most popular - Netflix, Amazon and Sky\u2019s Now TV - leapt by almost a quarter last year to 19.1m. Nearly half (47%) of UK homes now have a subscription streaming service, a significant increase on the 39% that did in 2017, with many households paying for two or more. The rapid shift in the nation\u2019s viewing habits continues to erode the popularity of traditional TV viewing. The average Briton now watches three hours and 12 minutes of TV a day \u2013 a drop of 20 minutes in the last two years and almost an hour since 2010.

Ofcom\u2019s report, however, said: \u201cA few popular drama and entertainment programmes are not enough on their own to stem the overall decline in broadcast TV viewing.\u201d ITV announced last month that it is to air two series of Love Island a year from 2019 in an effort to bolster its audiences and commercial revenues.

The decline among 25- to 34-year-olds was 39%, from 199 minutes to 122 minutes. The report shows that the main beneficiaries have been paid-for streaming services such as Netflix and YouTube\u2019s free online video platform. It found that 18- to 34-year-olds spent the most time on YouTube each day, followed by Netflix and then ITV, BBC1 with Amazon Prime Video rounding out the top five sources of viewing.

      "bodyText": "The Campaign for Real Ale (Camra) is calling time on beers that feature sexist names or imagery at its flagship annual event, the Great British beer festival, in a new move to stamp out outdated discriminatory attitudes. Drinks that have fallen victim to crude stereotyping \u2013 such as Slack Alice, a cider described as \u201ca little tart\u201d and pump clips featuring scantily-clad buxom women \u2013 have been banned from this week\u2019s event at London\u2019s Olympia which is set to attract tens of thousands of visitors. The blanket ban goes a step further than a new code of conduct launched by the campaign group last year and is supported by a new YouGov survey which found that 68% of female drinkers would be unlikely to buy a beer if they saw an advert for it using offensive \u201claddish\u201d imagery. The findings suggest British women are now actively boycotting products which reflect out of date and discriminatory attitudes and images associated with an industry traditionally dominated by men. All 1,000-plus beers, ciders and perries available at the festival have been checked to ensure they adhere to Camra\u2019s charter and strict code of conduct, which sets out its commitment to inclusivity and diversity. The festival has also picked Stonewall as its charity of choice and will be collecting on its behalf throughout the week. Camra\u2019s move comes in the wake of the burgeoning #MeToo movement and the backlash against sexual harassment and abuse. It is the latest in the beer sector to help stamp out sexism and stop the alienation of a growing band of female beer drinkers, brewers, workers, sommeliers and writers. Last year the Society of Independent Brewers (Siba) drew up a new code of practice to outlaw marketing deemed to be sexist and offensive. Abigail Newton, the vice-chair of Camra\u2019s national executive, said: \u201cConsumer organisations like Camra have an important role to play in making women feel more welcomed within the beer world.

The Italy international is quite willing to discuss his stand against racism and what occurred in the seconds, hours and weeks after his goal against Cagliari last season.</p> \n<p>Kean celebrated that close-range strike with a defiant stare, arms aloft, in front of the home fans who had jeered his every touch. Instead of support he was rebuked for the celebration by the then Juventus coach, Massimiliano Allegri. His teammate Leonardo Bonucci went further, claiming \u201cthe blame is 50-50\u201d for the abuse that intensified after Kean\u2019s goal.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/apr/03/raheem-sterling-leads-criticism-after-bonucci-says-kean-50-50-to-blame-for-racist-abuse\" title=\"\">Bonucci later back</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/apr/03/raheem-sterling-leads-criticism-after-bonucci-says-kean-50-50-to-blame-for-racist-abuse\" title=\"\">tracked</a> and was condemned by Allegri. Serie A officials described the chants as \u201ccertainly reprehensible\u201d, but took no action against Cagliari on the grounds they \u201chad an objectively limited relevance to race\u201d.</p> \n<p>Kean insists he was not left isolated by his former club. \u201cJuventus were on my side, they helped me,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have to fight against racism, everybody knows that, and the club was very helpful to me in that situation.\u201d</p> \n<p>But what of Bonucci, his senior colleague for club and country? \u201cI didn\u2019t pay any attention to that comment. I was concentrating strongly on playing to the best of my ability so that I could repay Juventus for the support they gave me. I spoke with him later and he apologised. He told me he was wrong and that he didn\u2019t know what he was talking about.\u201d</p> \n<p>Kean repaid Juventus with six goals in 13 league appearances last season as they took the Italian title for an eighth year in a row. He scored eight goals in 21 games in total for Juventus, was the club\u2019s youngest debutant at 16 years and 23 days, yet was allowed to leave an ageing side despite long being heralded as their future. The teenager, who comes across as a thoughtful and determined character, explains it was his decision to leave a Champions League contender, a Serie A winning regular, in search of greater responsibility with Everton.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/01/premier-league-201920-preview-no-8-everton\">Premier League 2019\u201120 preview No 8: Everton</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cI feel ready,\u201d he says. \u201cI have always had to take big responsibility because of my age.

      "bodyText": "Everton fans have raised more than \u00a32,700 for a banner that will proclaim they stand side-by-side with Moise Kean in his fight against racism. It represents a show of unity that was sorely lacking in April when the 19-year-old faced down his abusers while playing for Juventus against Cagliari, although the \u00a329m striker insists that sorry episode is not why Italian football has lost one of its finest young talents. \u201cNo, absolutely not,\u201d the teenager says when asked whether the racist abuse he suffered at Cagliari, and the fall-out from it, is why he swapped the Old Lady of Turin for the Grand Old Lady of Goodison Park. \u201cI like Everton. This is the reason I came here. I recognise myself in this team. Everton are looking ahead to the future and so am I.\u201d Kean\u2019s determination to look ahead to a new start in a new country should not, however, be seen as an attempt to draw a veil over the recent past. The Italy international is quite willing to discuss his stand against racism and what occurred in the seconds, hours and weeks after his goal against Cagliari last season. Kean celebrated that close-range strike with a defiant stare, arms aloft, in front of the home fans who had jeered his every touch. Instead of support he was rebuked for the celebration by the then Juventus coach, Massimiliano Allegri. His teammate Leonardo Bonucci went further, claiming \u201cthe blame is 50-50\u201d for the abuse that intensified after Kean\u2019s goal. Bonucci later backtracked and was condemned by Allegri. Serie A officials described the chants as \u201ccertainly reprehensible\u201d, but took no action against Cagliari on the grounds they \u201chad an objectively limited relevance to race\u201d. Kean insists he was not left isolated by his former club. \u201cJuventus were on my side, they helped me,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have to fight against racism, everybody knows that, and the club was very helpful to me in that situation.\u201d But what of Bonucci, his senior colleague for club and country? \u201cI didn\u2019t pay any attention to that comment. I was concentrating strongly on playing to the best of my ability so that I could repay Juventus for the support they gave me. I spoke with him later and he apologised. He told me he was wrong and that he didn\u2019t know what he was talking about.\u201d Kean repaid Juventus with six goals in 13 league appearances last season as they took the Italian title for an eighth year in a row. He scored eight goals in 21 games in total for Juventus, was the club\u2019s youngest debutant at 16 years and 23 days, yet was allowed to leave an ageing side despite long being heralded as their future. The teenager, who comes across as a thoughtful and determined character, explains it was his decision to leave a Champions League contender, a Serie A winning regular, in search of greater responsibility with Everton. \u201cI feel ready,\u201d he says. \u201cI have always had to take big responsibility because of my age. I met Marcel [Brands, Everton\u2019s director of football] first. I like his ideas, his objectives, we are very similar in this and we have the same views about a lot of things. \u201cI like the Premier League and I followed it a lot. I also spoke to my companions at Juventus. I spoke to Cristiano [Ronaldo]. And they told me things but I knew enough on my own.\u201d Ronaldo\u2019s message was succinct. \u201cHe told me to follow my dreams and work hard.\u201d Kean claims he has not turned his back on Champions League football by joining a team that finished eighth last season. \u201cIt is part of the ambition of any player to help bring his team to the Champions League,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat I want is to bring Everton into the Champions League.\u201d Evertonians launched a JustGiving campaign on the day Kean signed to raise \u00a31,000 for a banner that will be unveiled at his home debut against Watford on Saturday week. The target was surpassed in 24 hours and the extra money raised will be split equally between Kick It Out and Everton In The Community. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful because racism is horrendous and we have to fight against it,\u201d Kean says. \u201cI\u2019m going to repay the fans for all they do for me.\u201d",

Everton are yet to table a second bid for Zaha but, despite declaring last month that their rejected offer of \u00a352m was \u201cthe end of the matter\u201d, retain interest in the winger. Palace\u2019s stance on Zaha remains the same as Watford\u2019s on Doucour\u00e9, although Roy Hodgson is close to signing James McCarthy for around \u00a38m.",

      "bodyText": "The FBI is opening a domestic terrorism investigation into the shooting that killed three people at a popular California food festival last week. Authorities said in a Tuesday press conference that the gunman had a \u201ctarget list\u201d that included religious groups, US buildings and both political parties. The festival was also listed as a target. Nineteen-year-old Santino William Legan fatally shot three people, including two children, as the garlic festival in Gilroy was coming to an end on 28 July. Thirteen others were injured. Legan turned the gun on himself after being engaged by police officers. John Bennett, the FBI\u2019s agent in charge in San Francisco, says authorities still had not determined a motive and Legan appeared to be interested in conflicting ideologies. Investigators were examining Legan\u2019s digital media to determine his possible views, whom he may have been in contact with, who, if anyone, helped him and why he committed the violence, Bennett said. The list, which also included federal buildings and both major US political parties, was found during the examination of the digital evidence. Bennett said the groups included were being notified but the FBI would not release their names. Also on Tuesday, mourners packed a church in nearby San Jose for the funeral of one of the victims in the shooting. Before the service, friends and family members used colored markers to write messages on the casket of Keyla Salazar, two days after the girl would have turned 14. One read: \u201cKeyla, you\u2019re an angel. We will never forget you!\u201d Relatives wore T-shirts with a photo of a smiling Keyla with a crown of small pink paper flowers. Federal investigators have fewer tools and legal powers at their disposal in domestic terrorism cases than they do if they are up against someone tied to an international organization such as Isis or al-Qaida. Law enforcement officials conducting international terrorism investigations, for instance, can get a secret surveillance warrant to monitor the communications of a person they think may be an agent of a foreign power or terror group. The US criminal code also makes it a crime for anyone to lend material support to designated foreign terror organizations, even if the investigation doesn\u2019t involve accusations of violence. There is no domestic counterpart to that material support statute, meaning federal prosecutors must rely on hate crime laws, weapons charges and other approaches that may not carry the terrorism label. Mere membership in or support for a white supremacist organization is not illegal. Authorities said Tuesday that Legan fired 39 rounds before he killed himself. Three officers fired 18 times at him. None of the victims who died were struck by officers\u2019 fire, the Gilroy police chief, Scot Smithee, said. Legan was wearing a bullet-resistant vest and had multiple magazines on his body and on the ground, the chief said. Authorities also said they found more ammunition, a rifle scope, flashlight and shovel in a bag in a nearby creek.",

      "bodyText": "The UK risks being left behind in Europe\u2019s home battery boom because of a controversial tax hike on solar-battery systems, according to a report. The energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie has predicted that Europe\u2019s home battery capacity could climb fivefold in the next five years as more households plug their rooftop solar panels into battery packs. The analysts expect that by 2024, annual home battery installations across Europe could total more than 500MW, the equivalent of building a new gas-fired power plant every year. The report said the battery boom had already taken hold in Germany and would accelerate across Italy and Spain as battery power became more economic. However, the UK is likely to lag behind its European neighbours due to its \u201cunfavourable\u201d policy frameworks and a VAT increase for solar-battery packs this October. Rory McCarthy, a senior researcher at Wood Mackenzie, said Germany\u2019s lead had made Europe the largest residential storage market globally. \u201cOff the back of Germany\u2019s success, residential storage is beginning to proliferate into other European countries, particularly where market structures, prevailing power prices and disappearing feed-in tariffs create a favourable early stage deployment landscape,\u201d he said. \u201cThe economics of storage have been challenging in the past, however we are in the midst of an economic tipping point.\u201d The UK\u2019s laggard status comes after the government vowed to put energy storage at the heart of its plans for a cheap and clean energy system, which included a \u00a3246m pledge to develop battery technology. Greg Clark, the former business secretary, said the falling cost of energy storage meant it had a role to play in making renewable energy \u201cabundant\u201d. It will be more difficult for households to access the potential of low-cost renewable energy after the VAT hike on solar batteries installed from October. The UK has blamed EU rules for the VAT change, a claim disputed by Molly Scott Cato, a Green MEP for South West England. \u201cThere is appetite from [UK] utilities and technology providers but the market has no incentives so is lagging behind thus far,\u201d said the report. \u201cThe recent VAT increase from 5% to 20% confirmed to begin in October 2019 is not an effective way to kickstart a market with challenging economics.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Racing in the Tour de Pologne was suspended on Tuesday, as cycling paid tribute to the life of Bjorg Lambrecht, who died after a crash on Monday. Lambrecht\u2019s Lotto-Soudal teammates came across the finish line together in a neutralised fourth stage, one also specially adapted to pay tribute to the Belgian rider. The stage began with a minute\u2019s silence and it was followed by another at 48.5km, the distance at which Lambrecht had crashed the previous day. The 22-year-old is understood to have fallen into a concrete culvert during the third stage, from Chorzow to Zabrze. Riders from different teams, all wearing black armbands, took it in turn to lead the stage before ceding to the Lotto-Soudal riders. They came together to approach the finish before stepping off their bikes with 50 feet remaining and observing a third minute\u2019s silence. Eventually, they crossed through a black finishing arch, which also featured Lambrecht\u2019s name and his race number, 143. Lotto-Soudal afterwards paid their own tribute to Lambrecht. \u201cDuring the 2016 cycling season, as a first year U23, everybody was talking about Bjorg, within and also outside the peloton. Words like \u2018pocket climber\u2019, \u2018rough diamond\u2019, \u2018puncher\u2019, \u2018Grand Tour hope\u2019 were used,\u201d the team said in a statement. \u201cWith playful determination, he integrated into the world of professional cycling. Teammates and staff appreciated his work ethic and humility, opponents discovered his talent, and the media appreciated his nuanced but clear story. \u201cAll riders and staff of Lotto-Soudal would sincerely like to thank everybody for their expressions of sympathy in the usually hard top-level sports world. But in the first place, our thoughts go out to the parents, family and friends of Bjorg, who have to endure the greatest burden, a life without Bjorg.\u201d Lambrecht is the second professional rider to die this year after the Dutchman Robbert de Greef suffered a cardiac arrest in the Omloop van de Braakman. In June, the multiple Tour de France winner Chris Froome also suffered serious injury after a high-speed crash while on a reconnoitre of a stage in the Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9.",

China controls another part in the east.<br></p>\n    <p>India and Pakistan have gone to war a further two times over Kashmir, most recently in 1999. Artillery, mortar and small arms fire are still frequently exchanged.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How did the dispute start?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>After the partition of colonial India in 1947, small, semi-autonomous \u2018princely states\u2019 across the subcontinent were being folded into India or Pakistan. The ruler of Kashmir dithered over which to join until tribal fighters entered from Pakistan intent on taking the region for Islamabad.</p>\n    <p>Kashmir asked Delhi for assistance, signing a treaty of accession in exchange for the intervention of Indian troops, who fought the Pakistanis to the modern-day line of control.</p>\n    <p>In 1948, the UN security council called for a referendum in Kashmir to determine which country the region would join or whether it would become an independent state. The referendum has never been held.</p>\n    <p>In its 1950 constitution, India granted Kashmir a large measure of independence. But since then it has eroded some of that autonomy and repeatedly intervened to rig elections and dismiss and jail democratically elected leaders.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What was Kashmir\u2019s special status?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Kashmir\u2019s special status, given in exchange for joining the Indian union, had been in place since 14 May 1954. Under article 370, the state was given a separate constitution, a flag, and autonomy over all matters except for foreign affairs and defence.&nbsp;<br></p>\n    <p>An additional provision, article 35a, prevented people from outside the state buying land in the territory. Many Kashmiris believed this was crucial to protecting the demography of the Muslim-majority state and its way of life.</p>\n    <p>The ruling Bharatiya Janata party repeatedly promised to scrap such rules, a long-term demand of its Hindu nationalist support base. But analysts warned doing so would almost certainly ignite unrest.</p>\n    <p>On Wednesday 31 October 2019, the government formally revoked Kashmir\u2019s special status. The government argued that the provision had&nbsp; only ever intended to be temporary and that scrapping it would boost investment in Kashmir. Critics, however, said the move would escalate tensions with Pakistan \u2013 which quickly called India\u2019s actions illegal \u2013 and fuel resentment in Kashmir, where there is an insurgency against Indian rule.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What do the militants want?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>There has been an armed insurgency against Indian rule over its section of Kashmir for the past three decades. Indian soldiers and Pakistan-backed guerrillas fought a war rife with accusations of torture, forced disappearances and extra-judicial killing.<br></p>\n    <p>Until 2004, the militancy was made up largely of Pakistani and Afghan fighters. Since then, especially after protests were quashed with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/08/india-crackdown-in-kashmir-is-this-worlds-first-mass-blinding\">extreme force</a>&nbsp;in 2016, locals have made up a growing share of the anti-India fighters.</p>\n    <p>For Indians, control of Kashmir \u2013 part of the country\u2019s only Muslim-majority state \u2013 has been proof of its commitment to religious pluralism. For Pakistan, a state founded as a homeland for south Asian Muslims, it is the last occupied home of its co-religionists. <br><b><br>Michael Safi and Rebecca Ratcliffe</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cConsidering previous violations by troops, including excessive use of force against protesters, and the lack of accountability despite allegations of torture and extrajudicial killings, we hope that the government will ask security forces to be rights-respecting,\u201d said Meenakshi Ganguly, South Asia director for Human Rights Watch.</p> \n<p>One man, who asked not to be named, said he was travelling back to Srinagar from Delhi on Tuesday, because he was concerned about his family.

The shadow chancellor told an event at the Edinburgh festival fringe that his party should not try to block a second vote on independence by withholding the legal powers to do so. Interviewed by the broadcaster Iain Dale, McDonnell said: \u201cWe would not block something like that. We would let the Scottish people decide. That\u2019s democracy.\u201d McDonnell admitted Labour was split on the issue, but implied the UK leadership agreed. \u201cThere are other views within the party, but that\u2019s our view,\u201d he said. His remarks, which follow a poll on Monday showing 52% of Scottish voters now back independence, contradict Scottish Labour policy and the formal position of the UK party not to support another plebiscite on independence. Under section 30 of the Scotland Act, Holyrood could only hold one if it is given the power to do so by the UK government. The Conservative government has repeatedly refused to give it such authority, but the Brexit crisis and the growing prospects of an early general election has brought the question to the fore. Jeremy Corbyn, the UK Labour leader and a close ally of McDonnell, has repeatedly wavered on the issue, but has said that if he became prime minister the party would \u201cdecide at the time\u201d on whether to authorise a vote. Corbyn added, however: \u201cWe don\u2019t want another referendum, we don\u2019t think another referendum is a good idea, and we\u2019ll be very clear on why we don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea.\u201d McDonnell contradicted that stance, telling Dale: \u201cIt will be for the Scottish parliament and the Scottish people to decide that.

At more or less the same time the EU said it wants to talk \u201cshould the UK wish to clarify its position in more detail\u201d. The Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, offered another formulation. \u201cOur position is that the withdrawal agreement including the backstop is closed. But there is always room for talks and negotiations,\u201d he said in Northern Ireland.</p> <p>There are very different approaches here, as well as very different goals. Yet if such words have meaning, they mean the two sides want talks that could save them from no deal. It is not necessarily true that these would be doomed to fail. Mr Johnson says the EU must drop the Northern Ireland backstop from the withdrawal agreement. The EU says the withdrawal agreement, including the Irish backstop, is not going to change. In this hall of diplomatic mirrors, that leaves some room for discussion about timing and implementation. It should surely be taken.</p> <p>The question underlying all of this for Mr Johnson is whether there is some formulation on the backstop that the EU is prepared to make, that can keep his party together, win a majority in parliament and enable him to claim a breakthrough that provides a springboard for an election win that dishes the Brexit party. That is a very big ask, especially under the pressure of the 31 October deadline. Many suspect that Mr Johnson has already decided it is unachievable in the time remaining. But it may all the same be a less fraught route to his risk-laden goals than allowing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/06/the-fight-over-no-deal-brexit-how-might-the-crisis-pan-out\" title=\"\">a crash-out</a> from the EU that rallies the remainers to take their revenge and whose consequences in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/aug/06/dominos-stockpiles-toppings-to-beat-any-no-deal-brexit\" title=\"\">food industry</a> and on the petrol station forecourts frighten public opinion in ways to which his bullish bombast proves wholly unequal.</p>",

The Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, offered another formulation. \u201cOur position is that the withdrawal agreement including the backstop is closed. But there is always room for talks and negotiations,\u201d he said in Northern Ireland. There are very different approaches here, as well as very different goals. Yet if such words have meaning, they mean the two sides want talks that could save them from no deal. It is not necessarily true that these would be doomed to fail. Mr Johnson says the EU must drop the Northern Ireland backstop from the withdrawal agreement. The EU says the withdrawal agreement, including the Irish backstop, is not going to change. In this hall of diplomatic mirrors, that leaves some room for discussion about timing and implementation. It should surely be taken. The question underlying all of this for Mr Johnson is whether there is some formulation on the backstop that the EU is prepared to make, that can keep his party together, win a majority in parliament and enable him to claim a breakthrough that provides a springboard for an election win that dishes the Brexit party. That is a very big ask, especially under the pressure of the 31 October deadline. Many suspect that Mr Johnson has already decided it is unachievable in the time remaining. But it may all the same be a less fraught route to his risk-laden goals than allowing a crash-out from the EU that rallies the remainers to take their revenge and whose consequences in the food industry and on the petrol station forecourts frighten public opinion in ways to which his bullish bombast proves wholly unequal.",

Gove, who is in charge of no-deal preparations, reiterated Boris Johnson\u2019s position that the only route to progress would be the EU starting again with withdrawal negotiations, something Brussels has repeatedly and consistently ruled out. Adding to the impression of Johnson\u2019s hardening position, newly released government read-outs of the prime minister\u2019s phone calls with a series of EU leaders over recent days showed he delivered the same uncompromising message to them. While the Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, insisted on Tuesday that a no-deal departure was not inevitable, both he and the country\u2019s finance minister, Paschal Donohoe, warned of a significant and long-term change to relations between the countries if it did happen. Downing Street has increasingly pushed the message that Brexit will happen on 31 October under any circumstances \u2013 even intimating that No 10 believes the mandate of the 2016 Brexit referendum would overrule even a blocking vote in parliament. There is increasing worry among some MPs that Johnson could try to force through a no-deal Brexit against the will of the Commons, with his de facto chief of staff, Dominic Cummings, reportedly threatening No 10 staff with the sack if they dissent. The government\u2019s official position is still that it is seeking a formalised departure, albeit only if Brussels ditches the Irish backstop border insurance policy and reopens the withdrawal agreement. While the terms of the Brexit extension to 31 October made it plain neither could happen, Gove pushed the UK government\u2019s view that if there is no deal it will be due to EU intransigence. \u201cWe need a new approach and we stand ready to engage with the European Union, to negotiate in good faith to make sure that we can have a friendly relationship in the future,\u201d Gove said. \u201cWe will put all our energy into making sure that we can secure that good deal but at the moment it is the EU that seems to be saying they are not interested.

      "body": "<h2><strong>Ben Okri<br>Writer</strong></h2> \n<p>Toni Morrison didn\u2019t begin writing late, but she published much later than most writers, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/aug/06/toni-morrison-obituary\">after a career in publishing as an editor in New York</a>. This meant she gave the impression of coming into her literary life fully formed, with all the inflections of her style and the unique jazz-tinged poetry of her tone that encompassed the inward textures of black life, seen from the vantage point of wounded women who nevertheless have the strength to be witnesses to the brutalities of history on black lives and the unexpected redemptions, hard-won and ambiguous.</p> \n<p>She burst into the world of literature at a time that needed her supremely wrought perspective, and was by no means the first black woman writer to have such a strong presence on the literary scene in the US. When she arrived, with her first novel, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/-9780099759911.html\">The Bluest Eye</a>, she immediately re-ordered the American literary landscape. That voice had not existed before, those cadences cutting through the tangled slices of the American racial undergrowth, immensely fluid, capable of weaving the past and the present in a manner than was epical in compression.</p> \n<p>In novel after novel, with heft and an electric charge, she revealed the brutalised psyche of deep-singing women, of men upon whom the appalling weight of slavery and racial dehumanisation had wrought destructive traumas. The novels discharge these traumas, blasting them out from the secret caverns of unknown lives, in a prose that is threaded and shafted with intelligence, wit, unpredictability, tough truth.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ed357f440a9ddbd8d1362c0fe7ae27079896627e\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ed357f440a9ddbd8d1362c0fe7ae27079896627e/0_0_3757_3544/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Toni Morrison with her sons Slade and Ford in December 1978\" width=\"1000\" height=\"943\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Toni Morrison with her sons Slade and Ford in December 1978.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jack Mitchell/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Then, in 1977, a novel appeared that stood out from the many superb productions of the age. It was <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/song-of-solomon.html\">Song of Solomon</a>, and when we read it for the first time it was as if some biblical revelation of prose had been unleashed in America, and all that pain, all that magic, had been given a voice that transcended expectation. With Song of Solomon, a writer joined the forefront of the writers of her land. She was up there with Richard Wright, Saul Bellow, Ralph Ellison, Philip Roth, James Baldwin \u2013 writers who were challenging the inflection and the timbre of the American dream.</p> \n<p>But it was with <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/beloved-8.html\">Beloved</a>, in 1987, that her place in US literature was definitively sealed. It is an unprecedented work, both in its execution and the incidental narrative that it engendered in its appearance in the world. It must surely be the singular case of a novel that drew, with justification, the combined wrath of writers who were shocked that this great novel had not been honoured in the highest literary prize of its land. The roll call of writers who signed the petition demanding that the novel be properly honoured is itself a list of the most significant writers of the times. But Beloved is a novel that hovers over prizes. It was a national epic, breaching the veil between the living and the dead, a symphony of voices, a high watermark, and not surprisingly voted the best novel in American literature over the past 50 years.</p> \n<p>There is about Morrison\u2019s oeuvre a remarkable unity of tone and address, and a moral strength and integrity. The body of her work is not vast, but it has remarkable compression and the fire of an unmistakable vitality. When she won the Nobel prize for literature in 1993 she had published only six novels, but they were enough to etch a new space on the shelves of the literature of the world.</p> \n<p>Her shorter novels are fascinating, and her essays always enrich in their elliptical tone. It is common to speak of her as a black writer who wrote about race and slavery and the trauma of black female lives. But she is something more, both a witness and a celebrant. It would be a pity to miss the beauty of her language and her farsightedness in our desire to anchor her in contemporary relevance. She was brave, generous and rhythmically compelling. To hear her read her work is to be given another secret dimension of her appeal. She was a literary warrior in whose work the US peered into the black mirror of its untold truths. But her work spoke to people everywhere, to their traumas and their joys, in a language in which inspiration was at home.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"2ffe9b27-091f-4ad6-b337-94e757d61d4e\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/15MMmgwl1V4?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Ellah Wakatama Allfrey</strong></h2> \n<h2><strong>Editor and critic</strong></h2> \n<p>In 2009, I was senior editor at Jonathan Cape, Random House. I loved my job \u2013 I loved my books and my authors. But sometimes it was hard. I was consumed with the desire to publish books that would tell the stories of black people in Britain, stories from Africa or from her wide and varied diaspora. And it was hard, because nowhere could I see (at that time) anyone who looked like me who wanted the same thing. A friend from New York sent me a book of postcards featuring African American writers \u2013 James Baldwin, Richard Wright, Ntozake Shange and Toni Morrison. In the image, she has an afro with gentle waves of hair, her arms spread wide as if in wonder and joy. And she was sitting at her desk where she was senior editor at Random House. The picture has moved with me from desk to desk. I looked at her and knew that I was not only possible, but necessary.</p> \n<p>My sister describes reading The Bluest Eye as a young girl at a friend\u2019s farm outside Harare, in Zimbabwe. \u201cI finished it,\u201d she said, \u201cand I was furious that this white man Toni knew our secrets\u201d. In the days before Google \u2013 and perhaps too young to know that all she had to do was read the author bio \u2013 she carried this fury until I sent her (from my college in the US) Morrison\u2019s 1987 novel Beloved, along with a letter telling her why she had to read it.</p> \n<p>Today, we whisper tears over the phone across an ocean and remember for each other a writer who gave us language that was big enough to describe the love that is friendship, who taught us to look from the bottom rung of the ladder that is too often the reality of black womanhood and to perceive from this most difficult and complex of perspectives the most beautiful and terrifying of all the truths that make up the human condition.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ff30ecf1311fcbd28ccd8e031bbc14f4f5d448c0\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ff30ecf1311fcbd28ccd8e031bbc14f4f5d448c0/50_0_3390_3723/911.jpg\" alt=\"Toni Morrison in New York in 1979.\" width=\"911\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Toni Morrison in New York in 1979.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jack Mitchell/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Aminatta Forna</strong></h2> \n<h2><strong>Writer</strong></h2> \n<p>Morrison was one of the greatest of a generation of writers who helped to shift the centre of the literary imagination. She did so in her choice of theme and character, voicing the African American experience through black protagonists, and she brilliantly subverted expectations by choosing, at times, to identify only white characters by skin colour, or erasing mention of colour from her narrative altogether. Having lived in the US for the past four years, I feel her most significant contribution is to have memorialised, through art, the history and horror of slavery in a country that has thus far failed publicly to acknowledge or to offer redress for this original sin. This task has been left to artists, specifically African American artists. Morrison\u2019s legacy in commemorating slavery\u2019s survivors will endure and uplift for centuries to come.</p> \n<h2><strong>Danez Smith</strong></h2> \n<h2><strong>Poet</strong></h2> \n<p>The first time I came across her work, I didn\u2019t read it. Song of Solomon sat on my dresser, unopened, until it was too late and I panicked, plagiarising an essay on the novel for my 11th-grade English class. Thank God I got caught. My teacher failed me for the paper, but made me reread the book and submit an essay anyway. I thought then that she wanted to teach me a lesson about following through on a task. But from where I am now I can see that she was saying: \u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to miss this. You need to see what Morrison has written for you.\u201d Morrison is, to me, the best writer the English-speaking world has ever seen. The best novelist, one of the best essayists, one hell of an editor, and sometimes one of our greatest poets in the midst of her prose. By the time I came into the world, there was no question that this black woman from Ohio, writing about black people in the midwest, was one of the greats.</p> \n<p>What does that do to a young black writer? To a generation of black writers and writers of colour? By Morrison\u2019s example, we knew we could write ourselves and our people with love, rigour, and intention. We knew that to be asked to bend our writing towards the comfort of some imagined white reader was a distraction from the good and necessary work of achieving and dreaming up our people. We knew that the best writers don\u2019t just clear space for their own name, but make their abundance the wealth of many. Morrison did the thing. She lived a mighty life. She was loved and asked us to love harder. She wrote and we\u2019ll be trying to catch up to her for ever. Morrison is the foundation.</p> \n<p>I\u2019m wrecked to see her go, but as I sit here I can\u2019t help but smile thinking about all she did, all she enabled, all she built, all she dreamed, all those she invited into the room of letters. Rest, Toni. You did magnificent. You took this language they beat into our people and made us a feast. Thank you for making us better. Thank you for it all.</p> \n<h2><strong>Caryl Philips</strong></h2> \n<h2><strong>Author and playwright</strong></h2> \n<p>Morrison almost single-handedly took American fiction forward in the second half of the 20th century, to a place where it could finally embrace the subtleties and contradictions of the great stain of race which has blighted the republic since its inception. She broke ground, not only as a writer of great fiction and nonfiction, but as one of the most influential editors of her time \u2013 a pioneer, being both black and female. But more than this, an inspiration with her unswerving support for books and the authors in whom she believed. She fought tenaciously, as a writer and as an editor.</p> \n<h2><strong>Lynn Nottage</strong></h2> \n<h2><strong>Playwright</strong></h2> \n<p>Toni Morrison on a very personal level was immensely important to me. As a young girl, as a reader looking for representations of self, she was one of the first novelists who I felt captured the experience of being black in a way that resonated for me. I came of age in the 70s and prior to Toni Morrison there just wasn\u2019t an abundance of work written by black women that truthfully told our stories. She was immensely significant.</p> \n<p>The first book I read by Morrison was Sula and I think that the reason I responded to that book in particular was that the central character was this young, irreverent, unconventional, defiant black girl who felt very dangerous and familiar. Perhaps, Sula is the Morrison book that means the most because it was my introduction to her work and in many ways it was like a literary awakening for me. I remember the cover art, and I had such a visceral response that it continues to stay with me. Even though it might not be her most accomplished book, it is to me her most important book.</p> \n<p>At the time I read the book, she wasn\u2019t really a public figure \u2013 she hadn\u2019t risen to prominence. You have to understand that many of us were engaged with her work long before she became a public figure, books like Sula and The Bluest Eye were very much part of the black discourse they were widely embrace by the white mainstream. In many ways her middle novels like Song of Solomon and Beloved are the ones that she\u2019s most recognised for, but my love for Toni Morrison started long before those books were written.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"05d0d5840f23963da52bead437de8ada66e0825b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/05d0d5840f23963da52bead437de8ada66e0825b/0_0_2844_1992/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Morrison being presented with the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Obama in 2012.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"700\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Morrison being presented with the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Obama in 2012.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>I would say that she was able to capture a very specific black vernacular that at once elevated the language. There are elements of magical realism that permeate her novels, but I also think that I responded to her work because it was raw and honest, and there was always a sense of danger. She repeatedly wrestled with characters that were morally ambiguous and she wasn\u2019t afraid to lean into some of the contradictions of what it meant to be a black woman who was struggling to survive in a culture that sought to diminish your power and to render you invisible.</p> \n<p>No doubt she influenced my writing, she\u2019s part of my literary DNA because her books are the ones that I was leaning on when I was developing my voice. I did get to meet her \u2013 I had a fellowship at Princeton for the African-American studies department and she gave a talk and then a dinner afterwards which was one of those magical literary moments. I was sitting next to Joyce Carol-Oates and got to meet Toni Morrison who at that time was struggling with health issues, but still a very commanding presence in the room. What did I say to her? Probably something like \u201cGood to meet you\u201d [laughs]. Since I\u2019ve heard the news of her death I\u2019ve been in that space of mourning and just trying to process my own experience with her work.</p> \n<h2><strong>Candice Carty-Williams</strong></h2> \n<h2><strong>Novelist</strong></h2> \n<p>A friend called me to let me know that Morrison had died, such was her importance in my life. It feels as if I have lost a relative. I have always loved her work; one of the last books I worked on before I left my job in publishing was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/feb/08/mouth-full-of-blood-toni-morrison-review\" title=\"\">Mouth Full of Blood: Essays, Speeches, Meditations</a>. I just assumed she would be here for ever.</p> \n<p>If it wasn\u2019t for Morrison, I wouldn\u2019t be a writer. If it wasn\u2019t for her work, I don\u2019t think I would be here. We owe so much to her as a people, as black women. She paved the way for so many of us, naturally inspiring us to do what we need to do without any force or showiness. There\u2019s her quote: \u201cIf you don\u2019t see yourself in a book, write it.\u201d That\u2019s what I did with my novel Queenie. If it wasn\u2019t for her words, would I have thought I could do it? Would I have felt equipped to do it? Probably not.</p> \n<p>Another quote that I\u2019ll always remember is from Beloved: \u201cAnything dead coming back to life hurts.\u201d I have never heard human emotion summed up better, in anything I have read before or since. It\u2019s that way of accessing human emotion into so many books that we can relate to, even though she\u2019s not writing in this time and in this space. We owe the world to her. They say you should give people their flowers while they\u2019re still here, and part of me worries that she never had that, that she didn\u2019t know how important she was not just to literature, but the world. I want her to see the tribute that she deserves.</p> \n<p>Four years ago, I came across a photograph of her at a disco party. She looks incredible: literally afro out, in a slip dress, braless \u2013 the constraints are not there. I sent it to loads of my friends and I was like, \u201cI can\u2019t imagine what this feels like, to look like that.\u201d It\u2019s just the most amazing thing \u2013 it\u2019s like she has seen someone across the room, and she is free and happy. There\u2019s a \u201ccarefree black girl\u201d movement that I have never felt able to fit into, because I have a lot of cares, a lot of worries \u2013 I\u2019ve always looked at this photo whenever I\u2019ve needed to remind myself that I can be carefree. It was my computer desktop background when I was struggling in my job, struggling to get my words out, struggling with my identity. When I was feeling that I couldn\u2019t be more trapped, that was the picture that kept me going, and when I saw the news, that\u2019s what came up in my mind. I\u2019m just so grateful to Toni Morrison for that.</p> \n<h2><strong>Alice Walker</strong></h2> \n<h2><strong>Novelist</strong></h2> \n<p>We have lost a great writer whose extraordinary novels leave an indelible imprint on the consciousness of all who read them. What a force her thoughts have been and how grateful we must be that they were offered to us in this extremely challenging age.</p> \n<h2><strong>Candace Allen</strong></h2> \n<h2><strong>Author</strong></h2> \n<p>Morrison is always the ideal when it comes to writing. I had just found the possibility of a topic for my third novel when I saw the news of her death on Twitter. It completely floored me, but I quickly got the best rum in the house, went out into the garden and poured a libation in thanks for all she has done. For me, the message from Toni to take away, even though the words are Beckett\u2019s, is to fail better. We only have our language with which to tell our stories.</p> \n<p>At university, I remember reading The Bluest Eye and being devastated. I then went on to Sula and Beloved and Jazz \u2013 all of them depict black women so powerfully. At that time, I wasn\u2019t aspiring to be a writer, but she was telling me how to be a writer, how to be alive and how to give it profundity. Her legacy is human; the huge breadth of humanity is what she expressed \u2013 and in places people wouldn\u2019t perhaps notice it \u2013 and it\u2019s profound. It doesn\u2019t just affect black female writers; anyone with sense can only be inspired by her.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"34f2c2a712769d7672cc34910b751b9320bd5736\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/34f2c2a712769d7672cc34910b751b9320bd5736/0_86_1797_1078/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kimberly Elise, Oprah Winfrey and Thandie Newton in the 1998 film of Beloved\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kimberly Elise, Oprah Winfrey and Thandie Newton in the 1998 film of Beloved.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Touchstone Pictures</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Elif Shafak</strong></h2> \n<h2><strong>Author</strong></h2> \n<p>When you live in different countries and several cities throughout your life, one thing you will find hard as a novelist is to keep a library. But wherever I went there would always be a novel of hers travelling with me. Sometimes in English, sometimes in Turkish. The Bluest Eye. Song of Solomon. Beloved. Tar Baby. I felt soothed by her words, encouraged by her presence, inspired by her vision. Morrison had a huge impact on me. Secretly, I dreamed of being able to tell her this someday.</p> \n<p>Slavery, memory, sanity, spirituality, myth, destruction and inequality, but above all, survival. Her stories changed the literary landscape not only in America but also, through myriad translations, across the world. It wasn\u2019t only her novels, though. The way she defended and explained her craft was remarkable; she was a fighter and she was not afraid of taking risks. In her personal life she had to overcome many barriers - gender, racial and class. Novelist, editor, scholar, she was one of our most important public intellectuals.</p> \n<p>Recently, at an event at Daunt Books in London, a young mother from Sudan put her hand up and said she wanted to keep writing fiction but she found it hard to do so while raising three young kids. I said to her: \u201cThink about Toni Morrison. Remember what she said. Some days we won\u2019t be able to write, and that\u2019s all right. Other days we will be more productive. Sometimes we will work at night, sometimes during the day. We will carve out little pockets of spaces for ourselves, just like many women do. It is only privileged authors of a certain background who are proud of their precise schedules. The rest of us will keep struggling, sometimes failing, sometimes succeeding. It was Morrison who showed us that this is how we write.\u201d</p> \n<p>Morrison\u2019s work bore echoes of her life, but she insisted on the need for literature to be free, not necessarily autobiographical. Although her work was multilayered, and her themes diverse, in the end she always wrote about love \u2013 its powerful presence or painful absence.</p> \n<h2><strong>Bonnie Greer</strong></h2> \n<h2><strong>Playwright, novelist and critic</strong></h2> \n<p>Toni Morrison was a quintessential, unabashedly American writer. Like her fellow giant, Walt Whitman, her work was, above all, audacious. She seized the landscape with a flourish and wove it, unwove it and put it back together. Done with spirit and The Spirit.</p> \n<p>What it was.</p> \n<p>What it is.</p> \n<p>In this, and at the same time, she invented and reinvented the music of her people. She took for granted that we knew what she was doing, and put that music before us. With a blessing.</p> \n<p>Like her equal, Whitman, she cannot be imitated.</p> \n<h2><strong>Charlie Brinkhurst-Cuff</strong></h2> \n<h2><strong>Writer</strong></h2> \n<p>How can you do justice to a writer who saw your soul and wrote it too? I first read Toni Morrison\u2019s Beloved in high school and it was the first time I felt allowed to access the pain of my ancestors, the first time I felt like that deep welt inside of me had reason to be there and the first time I felt soothed by representation. I was captivated by the magic of Sethe\u2019s story, her haunting, her ability to sink into her pain, the chokecherry tree of scars that criss crossed her back. I hadn\u2019t read anything else up to then that allowed me to understand what it means to be able to trace your lineage back to slavery. Morrison\u2019s characters and her distinct voice will be with me for life. On days where it feels like there is nothing to do but listen and learn, I sit in bed with earphones clamped on tight, listening to her voice narrate the stories of a past I feel intimately connected to. I am so grateful and so sad. I often thought about the possibility of meeting her, but then realised that I wouldn\u2019t have anything interesting to say to someone of her greatness.</p> \n<h2><strong>Attica Locke</strong></h2> \n<h2><strong>Author</strong></h2> \n<p>A single question from Morrison\u2019s lips \u2013 \u201cBut invisible to whom?\u201d \u2013 had a greater effect on my life and psychological health than all of her novels put together. For in that question, in response to Ralph Ellison\u2019s novel The Invisible Man, she invited me to stop trying to see myself through the distorted mirror of the white gaze, which as often reflects me back to myself as grotesque or broken or obsequious toward my tormentors or violent and dangerous as it completely erases me. Not a part of the American history, or the country\u2019s political and cultural landscape. But Morrison\u2019s novels showed me myself. They made me real because I saw myself in print. I was literature.</p> \n<p>In The Bluest Eye and my beloved Beloved, in Song of Solomon, Sula and Paradise, her love for my blackness invited me as a young girl to love it too. Her novels moved and sustained me through young adulthood, through marriage and motherhood, through the pain and near nihilism of the last few years in US political life. But it is her work as a critical cultural theorist that has had the most lasting impression on my life. Playing in the Dark: Whiteness and the Literary Imagination, winner of the Nobel prize in literature, is a seminal text in my home. In this book, Morrison went past refusing to be viewed through the lens of white America and instead turned a black gaze on white life.</p> \n<p>Through a brilliant takedown of the canon of American literature, she boldly told white folks about themselves, reminding them that black people \u2013 blackness itself, the other \u2013 has given white Americans their identity, has defined the US\u2019s sense of itself. For there is no freedom \u2013 as reality or a concept \u2013 without enslaved men and women. There is no sense of white exceptionalism without white folks\u2019 boots on the neck of somebody brown. The book\u2019s query was: without your distorting gaze on black beauty and grace, fortitude and black artistry, who exactly are you? That question, cutting though it may be, gave me, as the kids say these days, \u201cmy whole life\u201d. Only in this case, I mean it quite literally. Toni Morrison saved my life many times, got me through the exquisite existential pain of feeling invisible, by displacing the white authority in my own head and replacing it with a new perspective that celebrated every aspect \u2013 pain, joy and, yes, frailty. And wisdom \u2013 of my blackness. I am psychologically healthier because she lived and thought and loved and wrote it all down. I will love her for ever.</p> \n<h2><strong>Preti Taneja</strong></h2> \n<h2><strong>Author</strong></h2> \n<p><em>Sweet Home</em>. <em>Here boy</em>. The sense of rememory \u2013 Toni Morrison\u2019s words and phrases seem so simple, but they are laden with the history of slavery and they break the power of white silencing. She takes the language of the oppressors, and instead of cursing with it, rinses liberation for the oppressed from it.</p> \n<p>I first read <em>Beloved </em>at 17. I knew it was specifically about black American history and experience, but I held on to each line \u2013 it was a revelation; it was proof. It was all I needed to confirm what I hadn\u2019t been able to say out loud: that there <em>was </em>violence in the way \u201ccivilised\u201d language works, and I felt that violence every day. Toni Morrison gave me early courage to believe that non-white women could own the English language with all the beauty of our own styles; and to hope that when we did write we would not be silenced and our words might not be lost. I never met her. But when my own book was picked up to be published by AA Knopf, the house in New York where she worked and which publishes her, I hoped maybe it would rub covers with hers on a shelf somewhere in that office. By way of homage and thanks, it was more than enough.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"789a958323328283ebfb81909ef1e0a67011701d\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/789a958323328283ebfb81909ef1e0a67011701d/0_0_3661_2654/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Toni Morrison in 2008.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"725\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Toni Morrison in 2008.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eamonn McCabe/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Hannah Azieb Pool</strong></h2> \n<h2><strong>Artistic director/CEO Bernie Grants Arts Centre</strong></h2> \n<p>I can\u2019t remember a time when I didn\u2019t love Morrison. She moved the very core of me at a young age. But the book that changed me the most was Beloved. It\u2019s such raw and beautiful storytelling. It changed me in a way that was almost physical. It gave me the confidence to own my blackness \u2013 especially in my writing. To voice it, to articulate it, to be proud of it, not to shy away from it. And to understand that black stories are universal, and at the same time very specific.</p> \n<p>You knew you were safe in her hands. She found a way to take the violence inflicted on black bodies \u2013 structural and systemic violence \u2013 and turn it into beautiful storytelling, but without glossing over anything or losing the politics.</p> \n<p>She is a vital example of a black woman writer who took on the mantle of being a black literary icon to create a space for generations of black, female writers who came after her. That\u2019s why we all feel we have ownership of her, that she\u2019s ours.</p> \n<p>The thought of no more words from Morrison, particularly in the world we are in at the moment, is such a loss. At times like this we look to our writers. To lose her voice at this time feels like a blow. Some writers you can always turn to to contextualise difficult moments in history in a way that makes me feel hopeful in spite of devastation.</p> \n<p>She was endlessly producing work that reached across generations, so you didn\u2019t have to be of her experience to feel she was talking about your experience. Her impact and reach were incredible. It\u2019s a seismic loss. It feels as if a tectonic plate has shifted. It\u2019s odd how devastating it is, to know she\u2019s not here any more. Because she gave black women everywhere a voice, and a way of telling our own stories.</p> \n<h2><strong>Tahmima Anam</strong></h2> \n<h2><strong>Author</strong></h2> \n<p>I write this from a small children\u2019s hospital in Queens, New York, where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/apr/09/for-five-years-we-dreaded-every-meal-my-infant-sons-struggle-with-food\">my son is learning to eat</a>. This morning, when I read the news of Toni Morrison\u2019s death, my son had just eaten his first piece of toast. He is six years old. So I cried seeing him eat that toast and at the loss of this great woman who has been speaking to my soul for as long as I can remember.</p> \n<p>The thing about Morrison is that she allows us, at any moment, to be in the presence of utter greatness. You can just open one of her books and something incredible will be there. It\u2019s like being able to walk into a cathedral any time you want. Her writing is a daily reminder of our capacity for magic. Eating toast. Making miracles out of words.</p> \n<h2><strong>Kamila Shamsie</strong></h2> \n<h2><strong>Author</strong></h2> \n<p>No other writer in my lifetime, or perhaps ever, has married so completely an understanding of the structures of power with knowledge of the human heart. No one else had her mastery of compression while being so expansive. She taught me about the world even while she was teaching me about the sentence, the word, the syllable. But though there\u2019s so much to say about her I find that all I really want to do is go to her novels and look again at their impossible brilliance. You might as well start with the opening of \u2018Jazz\u2019: \u201cSth, I know that woman. She used to live with a flock of birds on Lenox Avenue. Know her husband, too. He fell for an 18-year-old girl with one of those deepdown, spooky loves that made him so sad and happy he shot her just to keep the feeling going.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>Margaret Busby</strong></h2> \n<h2><strong>Publisher, editor, writer and broadcaster</strong></h2> \n<p>From the moment I knew of her, Toni Morrison was my literary inspiration, the person who I wished I could become \u2013 a feeling shared with many another black woman. I began to read her visionary novels in the 1970s, and to learn that she was also working in the very un-diverse publishing industry where I too was trying to make my way was both a solace and humbling. She once spoke to me of the challenges she faced as an editor having to ensure success for every black writer she took on \u2013 who included Gayl Jones, Angela Davis, Henry Dumas, and Toni Cade Bambara \u2013 lest negative assumptions be made about all black writers. Toni left publishing in 1983 so as to be able to devote more time to her own writing. After <em>The Bluest Eye </em>(1970),<em> Sula </em>(1973),<em> Song of Solomon </em>(1977), and<em> Tar Baby </em>(1981), <em>Beloved</em> was published in 1987 and has since been considered by many to be her breakthrough novel. However, when she came to London in 1988 for the UK publication of <em>Beloved</em> a television appearance that she and I had been due to make discussing publishing was dropped, ostensibly because Toni was not well enough known. Sindamani Bridglal, then a fledgling film-maker, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/dec/27/the-day-i-had-tea-with-toni-morrison\">has written</a> about how we addressed this huge faux pas by making our own film, which we sold to Channel 4 the month Toni won the Pulitzer prize. She would go on to become a Nobel prize-winner in 1993 and to garner many other prestigious accolades. In an article I wrote in 1993 I quoted something she had said in 1987, embracing the universal and the personal in a way that continues to resonate with me unapologetically: \u201cI really think the range of emotions and perceptions I have had access to as a black person and as a female person are greater than those of people who are neither \u2026 my world did not shrink because I was a black female writer. It just got bigger.\u201d The wisdom, compassion, dignity and genius Toni embodied was phenomenal, unforgettable and will be much missed.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Ben Okri Writer Toni Morrison didn\u2019t begin writing late, but she published much later than most writers, after a career in publishing as an editor in New York. This meant she gave the impression of coming into her literary life fully formed, with all the inflections of her style and the unique jazz-tinged poetry of her tone that encompassed the inward textures of black life, seen from the vantage point of wounded women who nevertheless have the strength to be witnesses to the brutalities of history on black lives and the unexpected redemptions, hard-won and ambiguous. She burst into the world of literature at a time that needed her supremely wrought perspective, and was by no means the first black woman writer to have such a strong presence on the literary scene in the US. When she arrived, with her first novel, The Bluest Eye, she immediately re-ordered the American literary landscape. That voice had not existed before, those cadences cutting through the tangled slices of the American racial undergrowth, immensely fluid, capable of weaving the past and the present in a manner than was epical in compression. In novel after novel, with heft and an electric charge, she revealed the brutalised psyche of deep-singing women, of men upon whom the appalling weight of slavery and racial dehumanisation had wrought destructive traumas. The novels discharge these traumas, blasting them out from the secret caverns of unknown lives, in a prose that is threaded and shafted with intelligence, wit, unpredictability, tough truth. Then, in 1977, a novel appeared that stood out from the many superb productions of the age. It was Song of Solomon, and when we read it for the first time it was as if some biblical revelation of prose had been unleashed in America, and all that pain, all that magic, had been given a voice that transcended expectation. With Song of Solomon, a writer joined the forefront of the writers of her land. She was up there with Richard Wright, Saul Bellow, Ralph Ellison, Philip Roth, James Baldwin \u2013 writers who were challenging the inflection and the timbre of the American dream. But it was with Beloved, in 1987, that her place in US literature was definitively sealed. It is an unprecedented work, both in its execution and the incidental narrative that it engendered in its appearance in the world. It must surely be the singular case of a novel that drew, with justification, the combined wrath of writers who were shocked that this great novel had not been honoured in the highest literary prize of its land. The roll call of writers who signed the petition demanding that the novel be properly honoured is itself a list of the most significant writers of the times. But Beloved is a novel that hovers over prizes. It was a national epic, breaching the veil between the living and the dead, a symphony of voices, a high watermark, and not surprisingly voted the best novel in American literature over the past 50 years. There is about Morrison\u2019s oeuvre a remarkable unity of tone and address, and a moral strength and integrity. The body of her work is not vast, but it has remarkable compression and the fire of an unmistakable vitality. When she won the Nobel prize for literature in 1993 she had published only six novels, but they were enough to etch a new space on the shelves of the literature of the world. Her shorter novels are fascinating, and her essays always enrich in their elliptical tone. It is common to speak of her as a black writer who wrote about race and slavery and the trauma of black female lives. But she is something more, both a witness and a celebrant. It would be a pity to miss the beauty of her language and her farsightedness in our desire to anchor her in contemporary relevance. She was brave, generous and rhythmically compelling. To hear her read her work is to be given another secret dimension of her appeal. She was a literary warrior in whose work the US peered into the black mirror of its untold truths. But her work spoke to people everywhere, to their traumas and their joys, in a language in which inspiration was at home. Ellah Wakatama Allfrey Editor and critic In 2009, I was senior editor at Jonathan Cape, Random House. I loved my job \u2013 I loved my books and my authors. But sometimes it was hard. I was consumed with the desire to publish books that would tell the stories of black people in Britain, stories from Africa or from her wide and varied diaspora. And it was hard, because nowhere could I see (at that time) anyone who looked like me who wanted the same thing. A friend from New York sent me a book of postcards featuring African American writers \u2013 James Baldwin, Richard Wright, Ntozake Shange and Toni Morrison. In the image, she has an afro with gentle waves of hair, her arms spread wide as if in wonder and joy. And she was sitting at her desk where she was senior editor at Random House. The picture has moved with me from desk to desk. I looked at her and knew that I was not only possible, but necessary. My sister describes reading The Bluest Eye as a young girl at a friend\u2019s farm outside Harare, in Zimbabwe. \u201cI finished it,\u201d she said, \u201cand I was furious that this white man Toni knew our secrets\u201d. In the days before Google \u2013 and perhaps too young to know that all she had to do was read the author bio \u2013 she carried this fury until I sent her (from my college in the US) Morrison\u2019s 1987 novel Beloved, along with a letter telling her why she had to read it. Today, we whisper tears over the phone across an ocean and remember for each other a writer who gave us language that was big enough to describe the love that is friendship, who taught us to look from the bottom rung of the ladder that is too often the reality of black womanhood and to perceive from this most difficult and complex of perspectives the most beautiful and terrifying of all the truths that make up the human condition. Aminatta Forna Writer Morrison was one of the greatest of a generation of writers who helped to shift the centre of the literary imagination. She did so in her choice of theme and character, voicing the African American experience through black protagonists, and she brilliantly subverted expectations by choosing, at times, to identify only white characters by skin colour, or erasing mention of colour from her narrative altogether. Having lived in the US for the past four years, I feel her most significant contribution is to have memorialised, through art, the history and horror of slavery in a country that has thus far failed publicly to acknowledge or to offer redress for this original sin. This task has been left to artists, specifically African American artists. Morrison\u2019s legacy in commemorating slavery\u2019s survivors will endure and uplift for centuries to come. Danez Smith Poet The first time I came across her work, I didn\u2019t read it. Song of Solomon sat on my dresser, unopened, until it was too late and I panicked, plagiarising an essay on the novel for my 11th-grade English class. Thank God I got caught. My teacher failed me for the paper, but made me reread the book and submit an essay anyway. I thought then that she wanted to teach me a lesson about following through on a task. But from where I am now I can see that she was saying: \u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to miss this. You need to see what Morrison has written for you.\u201d Morrison is, to me, the best writer the English-speaking world has ever seen. The best novelist, one of the best essayists, one hell of an editor, and sometimes one of our greatest poets in the midst of her prose. By the time I came into the world, there was no question that this black woman from Ohio, writing about black people in the midwest, was one of the greats. What does that do to a young black writer? To a generation of black writers and writers of colour? By Morrison\u2019s example, we knew we could write ourselves and our people with love, rigour, and intention. We knew that to be asked to bend our writing towards the comfort of some imagined white reader was a distraction from the good and necessary work of achieving and dreaming up our people. We knew that the best writers don\u2019t just clear space for their own name, but make their abundance the wealth of many. Morrison did the thing. She lived a mighty life. She was loved and asked us to love harder. She wrote and we\u2019ll be trying to catch up to her for ever. Morrison is the foundation. I\u2019m wrecked to see her go, but as I sit here I can\u2019t help but smile thinking about all she did, all she enabled, all she built, all she dreamed, all those she invited into the room of letters. Rest, Toni. You did magnificent. You took this language they beat into our people and made us a feast. Thank you for making us better. Thank you for it all. Caryl Philips Author and playwright Morrison almost single-handedly took American fiction forward in the second half of the 20th century, to a place where it could finally embrace the subtleties and contradictions of the great stain of race which has blighted the republic since its inception. She broke ground, not only as a writer of great fiction and nonfiction, but as one of the most influential editors of her time \u2013 a pioneer, being both black and female. But more than this, an inspiration with her unswerving support for books and the authors in whom she believed. She fought tenaciously, as a writer and as an editor. Lynn Nottage Playwright Toni Morrison on a very personal level was immensely important to me. As a young girl, as a reader looking for representations of self, she was one of the first novelists who I felt captured the experience of being black in a way that resonated for me. I came of age in the 70s and prior to Toni Morrison there just wasn\u2019t an abundance of work written by black women that truthfully told our stories. She was immensely significant. The first book I read by Morrison was Sula and I think that the reason I responded to that book in particular was that the central character was this young, irreverent, unconventional, defiant black girl who felt very dangerous and familiar. Perhaps, Sula is the Morrison book that means the most because it was my introduction to her work and in many ways it was like a literary awakening for me. I remember the cover art, and I had such a visceral response that it continues to stay with me. Even though it might not be her most accomplished book, it is to me her most important book. At the time I read the book, she wasn\u2019t really a public figure \u2013 she hadn\u2019t risen to prominence. You have to understand that many of us were engaged with her work long before she became a public figure, books like Sula and The Bluest Eye were very much part of the black discourse they were widely embrace by the white mainstream. In many ways her middle novels like Song of Solomon and Beloved are the ones that she\u2019s most recognised for, but my love for Toni Morrison started long before those books were written. I would say that she was able to capture a very specific black vernacular that at once elevated the language. There are elements of magical realism that permeate her novels, but I also think that I responded to her work because it was raw and honest, and there was always a sense of danger. She repeatedly wrestled with characters that were morally ambiguous and she wasn\u2019t afraid to lean into some of the contradictions of what it meant to be a black woman who was struggling to survive in a culture that sought to diminish your power and to render you invisible. No doubt she influenced my writing, she\u2019s part of my literary DNA because her books are the ones that I was leaning on when I was developing my voice. I did get to meet her \u2013 I had a fellowship at Princeton for the African-American studies department and she gave a talk and then a dinner afterwards which was one of those magical literary moments. I was sitting next to Joyce Carol-Oates and got to meet Toni Morrison who at that time was struggling with health issues, but still a very commanding presence in the room. What did I say to her? Probably something like \u201cGood to meet you\u201d [laughs]. Since I\u2019ve heard the news of her death I\u2019ve been in that space of mourning and just trying to process my own experience with her work. Candice Carty-Williams Novelist A friend called me to let me know that Morrison had died, such was her importance in my life. It feels as if I have lost a relative. I have always loved her work; one of the last books I worked on before I left my job in publishing was Mouth Full of Blood: Essays, Speeches, Meditations. I just assumed she would be here for ever. If it wasn\u2019t for Morrison, I wouldn\u2019t be a writer. If it wasn\u2019t for her work, I don\u2019t think I would be here. We owe so much to her as a people, as black women. She paved the way for so many of us, naturally inspiring us to do what we need to do without any force or showiness. There\u2019s her quote: \u201cIf you don\u2019t see yourself in a book, write it.\u201d That\u2019s what I did with my novel Queenie. If it wasn\u2019t for her words, would I have thought I could do it? Would I have felt equipped to do it? Probably not. Another quote that I\u2019ll always remember is from Beloved: \u201cAnything dead coming back to life hurts.\u201d I have never heard human emotion summed up better, in anything I have read before or since. It\u2019s that way of accessing human emotion into so many books that we can relate to, even though she\u2019s not writing in this time and in this space. We owe the world to her. They say you should give people their flowers while they\u2019re still here, and part of me worries that she never had that, that she didn\u2019t know how important she was not just to literature, but the world. I want her to see the tribute that she deserves. Four years ago, I came across a photograph of her at a disco party. She looks incredible: literally afro out, in a slip dress, braless \u2013 the constraints are not there. I sent it to loads of my friends and I was like, \u201cI can\u2019t imagine what this feels like, to look like that.\u201d It\u2019s just the most amazing thing \u2013 it\u2019s like she has seen someone across the room, and she is free and happy. There\u2019s a \u201ccarefree black girl\u201d movement that I have never felt able to fit into, because I have a lot of cares, a lot of worries \u2013 I\u2019ve always looked at this photo whenever I\u2019ve needed to remind myself that I can be carefree. It was my computer desktop background when I was struggling in my job, struggling to get my words out, struggling with my identity. When I was feeling that I couldn\u2019t be more trapped, that was the picture that kept me going, and when I saw the news, that\u2019s what came up in my mind. I\u2019m just so grateful to Toni Morrison for that. Alice Walker Novelist We have lost a great writer whose extraordinary novels leave an indelible imprint on the consciousness of all who read them. What a force her thoughts have been and how grateful we must be that they were offered to us in this extremely challenging age. Candace Allen Author Morrison is always the ideal when it comes to writing. I had just found the possibility of a topic for my third novel when I saw the news of her death on Twitter. It completely floored me, but I quickly got the best rum in the house, went out into the garden and poured a libation in thanks for all she has done. For me, the message from Toni to take away, even though the words are Beckett\u2019s, is to fail better. We only have our language with which to tell our stories. At university, I remember reading The Bluest Eye and being devastated. I then went on to Sula and Beloved and Jazz \u2013 all of them depict black women so powerfully. At that time, I wasn\u2019t aspiring to be a writer, but she was telling me how to be a writer, how to be alive and how to give it profundity. Her legacy is human; the huge breadth of humanity is what she expressed \u2013 and in places people wouldn\u2019t perhaps notice it \u2013 and it\u2019s profound. It doesn\u2019t just affect black female writers; anyone with sense can only be inspired by her. Elif Shafak Author When you live in different countries and several cities throughout your life, one thing you will find hard as a novelist is to keep a library. But wherever I went there would always be a novel of hers travelling with me. Sometimes in English, sometimes in Turkish. The Bluest Eye. Song of Solomon. Beloved. Tar Baby. I felt soothed by her words, encouraged by her presence, inspired by her vision. Morrison had a huge impact on me. Secretly, I dreamed of being able to tell her this someday. Slavery, memory, sanity, spirituality, myth, destruction and inequality, but above all, survival. Her stories changed the literary landscape not only in America but also, through myriad translations, across the world. It wasn\u2019t only her novels, though. The way she defended and explained her craft was remarkable; she was a fighter and she was not afraid of taking risks. In her personal life she had to overcome many barriers - gender, racial and class. Novelist, editor, scholar, she was one of our most important public intellectuals. Recently, at an event at Daunt Books in London, a young mother from Sudan put her hand up and said she wanted to keep writing fiction but she found it hard to do so while raising three young kids. I said to her: \u201cThink about Toni Morrison. Remember what she said. Some days we won\u2019t be able to write, and that\u2019s all right. Other days we will be more productive. Sometimes we will work at night, sometimes during the day. We will carve out little pockets of spaces for ourselves, just like many women do. It is only privileged authors of a certain background who are proud of their precise schedules. The rest of us will keep struggling, sometimes failing, sometimes succeeding. It was Morrison who showed us that this is how we write.\u201d Morrison\u2019s work bore echoes of her life, but she insisted on the need for literature to be free, not necessarily autobiographical. Although her work was multilayered, and her themes diverse, in the end she always wrote about love \u2013 its powerful presence or painful absence. Bonnie Greer Playwright, novelist and critic Toni Morrison was a quintessential, unabashedly American writer. Like her fellow giant, Walt Whitman, her work was, above all, audacious. She seized the landscape with a flourish and wove it, unwove it and put it back together. Done with spirit and The Spirit. What it was. What it is. In this, and at the same time, she invented and reinvented the music of her people. She took for granted that we knew what she was doing, and put that music before us. With a blessing. Like her equal, Whitman, she cannot be imitated. Charlie Brinkhurst-Cuff Writer How can you do justice to a writer who saw your soul and wrote it too? I first read Toni Morrison\u2019s Beloved in high school and it was the first time I felt allowed to access the pain of my ancestors, the first time I felt like that deep welt inside of me had reason to be there and the first time I felt soothed by representation. I was captivated by the magic of Sethe\u2019s story, her haunting, her ability to sink into her pain, the chokecherry tree of scars that criss crossed her back. I hadn\u2019t read anything else up to then that allowed me to understand what it means to be able to trace your lineage back to slavery. Morrison\u2019s characters and her distinct voice will be with me for life. On days where it feels like there is nothing to do but listen and learn, I sit in bed with earphones clamped on tight, listening to her voice narrate the stories of a past I feel intimately connected to. I am so grateful and so sad. I often thought about the possibility of meeting her, but then realised that I wouldn\u2019t have anything interesting to say to someone of her greatness. Attica Locke Author A single question from Morrison\u2019s lips \u2013 \u201cBut invisible to whom?\u201d \u2013 had a greater effect on my life and psychological health than all of her novels put together. For in that question, in response to Ralph Ellison\u2019s novel The Invisible Man, she invited me to stop trying to see myself through the distorted mirror of the white gaze, which as often reflects me back to myself as grotesque or broken or obsequious toward my tormentors or violent and dangerous as it completely erases me. Not a part of the American history, or the country\u2019s political and cultural landscape. But Morrison\u2019s novels showed me myself. They made me real because I saw myself in print. I was literature. In The Bluest Eye and my beloved Beloved, in Song of Solomon, Sula and Paradise, her love for my blackness invited me as a young girl to love it too. Her novels moved and sustained me through young adulthood, through marriage and motherhood, through the pain and near nihilism of the last few years in US political life. But it is her work as a critical cultural theorist that has had the most lasting impression on my life. Playing in the Dark: Whiteness and the Literary Imagination, winner of the Nobel prize in literature, is a seminal text in my home. In this book, Morrison went past refusing to be viewed through the lens of white America and instead turned a black gaze on white life. Through a brilliant takedown of the canon of American literature, she boldly told white folks about themselves, reminding them that black people \u2013 blackness itself, the other \u2013 has given white Americans their identity, has defined the US\u2019s sense of itself. For there is no freedom \u2013 as reality or a concept \u2013 without enslaved men and women. There is no sense of white exceptionalism without white folks\u2019 boots on the neck of somebody brown. The book\u2019s query was: without your distorting gaze on black beauty and grace, fortitude and black artistry, who exactly are you? That question, cutting though it may be, gave me, as the kids say these days, \u201cmy whole life\u201d. Only in this case, I mean it quite literally. Toni Morrison saved my life many times, got me through the exquisite existential pain of feeling invisible, by displacing the white authority in my own head and replacing it with a new perspective that celebrated every aspect \u2013 pain, joy and, yes, frailty. And wisdom \u2013 of my blackness. I am psychologically healthier because she lived and thought and loved and wrote it all down. I will love her for ever. Preti Taneja Author Sweet Home. Here boy. The sense of rememory \u2013 Toni Morrison\u2019s words and phrases seem so simple, but they are laden with the history of slavery and they break the power of white silencing. She takes the language of the oppressors, and instead of cursing with it, rinses liberation for the oppressed from it. I first read Beloved at 17. I knew it was specifically about black American history and experience, but I held on to each line \u2013 it was a revelation; it was proof. It was all I needed to confirm what I hadn\u2019t been able to say out loud: that there was violence in the way \u201ccivilised\u201d language works, and I felt that violence every day. Toni Morrison gave me early courage to believe that non-white women could own the English language with all the beauty of our own styles; and to hope that when we did write we would not be silenced and our words might not be lost. I never met her. But when my own book was picked up to be published by AA Knopf, the house in New York where she worked and which publishes her, I hoped maybe it would rub covers with hers on a shelf somewhere in that office. By way of homage and thanks, it was more than enough. Hannah Azieb Pool Artistic director/CEO Bernie Grants Arts Centre I can\u2019t remember a time when I didn\u2019t love Morrison. She moved the very core of me at a young age. But the book that changed me the most was Beloved. It\u2019s such raw and beautiful storytelling. It changed me in a way that was almost physical. It gave me the confidence to own my blackness \u2013 especially in my writing. To voice it, to articulate it, to be proud of it, not to shy away from it. And to understand that black stories are universal, and at the same time very specific. You knew you were safe in her hands. She found a way to take the violence inflicted on black bodies \u2013 structural and systemic violence \u2013 and turn it into beautiful storytelling, but without glossing over anything or losing the politics. She is a vital example of a black woman writer who took on the mantle of being a black literary icon to create a space for generations of black, female writers who came after her. That\u2019s why we all feel we have ownership of her, that she\u2019s ours. The thought of no more words from Morrison, particularly in the world we are in at the moment, is such a loss. At times like this we look to our writers. To lose her voice at this time feels like a blow. Some writers you can always turn to to contextualise difficult moments in history in a way that makes me feel hopeful in spite of devastation. She was endlessly producing work that reached across generations, so you didn\u2019t have to be of her experience to feel she was talking about your experience. Her impact and reach were incredible. It\u2019s a seismic loss. It feels as if a tectonic plate has shifted. It\u2019s odd how devastating it is, to know she\u2019s not here any more. Because she gave black women everywhere a voice, and a way of telling our own stories. Tahmima Anam Author I write this from a small children\u2019s hospital in Queens, New York, where my son is learning to eat. This morning, when I read the news of Toni Morrison\u2019s death, my son had just eaten his first piece of toast. He is six years old. So I cried seeing him eat that toast and at the loss of this great woman who has been speaking to my soul for as long as I can remember. The thing about Morrison is that she allows us, at any moment, to be in the presence of utter greatness. You can just open one of her books and something incredible will be there. It\u2019s like being able to walk into a cathedral any time you want. Her writing is a daily reminder of our capacity for magic. Eating toast. Making miracles out of words. Kamila Shamsie Author No other writer in my lifetime, or perhaps ever, has married so completely an understanding of the structures of power with knowledge of the human heart. No one else had her mastery of compression while being so expansive. She taught me about the world even while she was teaching me about the sentence, the word, the syllable. But though there\u2019s so much to say about her I find that all I really want to do is go to her novels and look again at their impossible brilliance. You might as well start with the opening of \u2018Jazz\u2019: \u201cSth, I know that woman. She used to live with a flock of birds on Lenox Avenue. Know her husband, too. He fell for an 18-year-old girl with one of those deepdown, spooky loves that made him so sad and happy he shot her just to keep the feeling going.\u201d Margaret Busby Publisher, editor, writer and broadcaster From the moment I knew of her, Toni Morrison was my literary inspiration, the person who I wished I could become \u2013 a feeling shared with many another black woman. I began to read her visionary novels in the 1970s, and to learn that she was also working in the very un-diverse publishing industry where I too was trying to make my way was both a solace and humbling. She once spoke to me of the challenges she faced as an editor having to ensure success for every black writer she took on \u2013 who included Gayl Jones, Angela Davis, Henry Dumas, and Toni Cade Bambara \u2013 lest negative assumptions be made about all black writers. Toni left publishing in 1983 so as to be able to devote more time to her own writing. After The Bluest Eye (1970), Sula (1973), Song of Solomon (1977), and Tar Baby (1981), Beloved was published in 1987 and has since been considered by many to be her breakthrough novel. However, when she came to London in 1988 for the UK publication of Beloved a television appearance that she and I had been due to make discussing publishing was dropped, ostensibly because Toni was not well enough known. Sindamani Bridglal, then a fledgling film-maker, has written about how we addressed this huge faux pas by making our own film, which we sold to Channel 4 the month Toni won the Pulitzer prize. She would go on to become a Nobel prize-winner in 1993 and to garner many other prestigious accolades. In an article I wrote in 1993 I quoted something she had said in 1987, embracing the universal and the personal in a way that continues to resonate with me unapologetically: \u201cI really think the range of emotions and perceptions I have had access to as a black person and as a female person are greater than those of people who are neither \u2026 my world did not shrink because I was a black female writer. It just got bigger.\u201d The wisdom, compassion, dignity and genius Toni embodied was phenomenal, unforgettable and will be much missed.",

      "body": "<p>Toni Morrison, who has died aged 88, was the only African American writer and one of the few women to have received the Nobel prize for literature. The announcement of her 1993 award cited her as a writer \u201cwho, in novels characterised by visionary force and poetic import, gives life to an essential aspect of American reality\u201d. In her acceptance speech Morrison emphasised the importance of language \u201cpartly as a system, partly as a living thing over which one has control, but mostly as an agency \u2013 as an act with consequences\u201d.</p> <p>She expressed her own credo, and indicated the core preoccupations of her fiction, in the fable at the heart of her speech, where she imagines young people telling an old black woman: \u201cNarrative is radical, creating us at the very moment it is being created ... For our sakes and yours forget your name in the street; tell us what the world has been to you in the dark places and in the light ... Tell us what it is to be a woman so that we may know what it is to be a man. What moves at the margin. What it is to have no home in this place. To be set adrift from the one you knew. What it is to live at the edge of towns that cannot bear your company.\u201d</p> <p>When she started producing fiction, she was editing other writers for the publishers Random House in New York and began to feel the lack of novels which spoke to readers such as herself. Beginning with The Bluest Eye (1969), her novels portray the psychic and social lives of African American women, as well as men, covering the trauma of slavery and its economic and psychological consequences during and after the 19th century.</p> <p>Her second novel, Sula (1973), provides a terse and vivid contrast between two black women, one a rebel and the other a conformist, whose stories and struggle to come to terms with one another and their community set the pattern for some of her later fiction. Song of Solomon (1977) is wider ranging historically and geographically and, unusually within Morrison\u2019s oeuvre, has a black male character, Milkman Dead, as its main protagonist. Here the elements of magic realism suggested in Sula are developed and Morrison draws on the African American myth of slaves escaping by flying away as an image of Milkman\u2019s discovery of his roots in a southern African American tradition. For this novel Morrison won the National Book Critics\u2019 Circle award.</p> <p>Many readers and critics on both sides of the Atlantic regard her highest achievement to be Beloved (1987), the first novel in a trilogy chronicling black American small town and urban communities over the past 150 years. It is based on a factual incident that she uncovered while preparing a historical collection, The Black Book (1974), and explores the terrible impact of slavery, its brutality and its dehumanisation, on a young mother who murders her child to prevent her being repossessed by the slave-owner from whom she has escaped. The mother and those who live with her are haunted by the memory of the dead child, and the novel is also a more general representation of the terrible history that continues to haunt African Americans, a history that must be confronted in all its anguish before black people can learn to love themselves and one another.</p> <p>The New York Times columnist Michiko Kakutani wrote that Beloved \u201cpossesses the heightened power and resonance of myth \u2013 its characters, like those in an opera or Greek drama, seem larger than life and their actions, too, tend to strike us as enactments of ancient rituals and passions. To describe Beloved only in these terms, however, is to diminish its immediacy, for the novel also remains precisely grounded in American reality \u2013 the reality of black history as experienced in the wake of the civil war.\u201d</p> <p>Beloved was awarded the Pulitzer prize for fiction in 1988, although not before a letter signed by more than 40 of America\u2019s leading black writers and scholars had decried the lack of recognition for this outstanding novel. However, the New Republic critic Stanley Crouch felt the book was over-written, and at times became trite and sentimental. Crouch was among a number of black critics who dismissed the award of the Nobel prize as a mark of her ties to a European literary tradition rather than an African American one. Morrison won it following the publication of Jazz (1992), a novel set in Harlem in the 1920s concerning a love triangle in which a husband murders his teenage mistress, which employs a narrative structure akin to jazz, with the opening statement of a theme and a series of elaborations. Paradise (1998) returned to the small-town setting in rural Ohio that had featured in Beloved. Like the two preceding novels, it evolves from a catastrophic act of violence, in this case a murderous attack on a community of women.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"46bbf7f8ea54cfafeda3a689c8bcc47676b5bc15\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/46bbf7f8ea54cfafeda3a689c8bcc47676b5bc15/0_392_4656_2794/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Oprah Winfrey in Beloved, directed by Jonathan Demme (1998).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oprah Winfrey in Beloved, directed by Jonathan Demme (1998).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Photo 12/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Five years later, she published Love (2003), a family saga that has some similarities to The Song of Solomon in that it weaves its story around the lasting impact of a wealthy black patriarch and entrepreneur, Bill Cosey, the owner of Cosey\u2019s Hotel and Resort, whose fortunes rest on the need for a holiday resort for black people in segregated America. His character becomes the focus of various generations of women\u2019s longing for father, husband, lover, guardian and friend. Some critics have cautiously noted the teasing similarity between the central male protagonist\u2019s name and that of the millionaire African American entertainer Bill Cosby.</p> <p>Like The Song of Solomon, this novel records the historical and cultural changes affecting African Americans from the 1930s till the 80s, before, during and after the civil rights movement. Although many reviewers hailed the publication of Love as demonstrating a return to the kind of writing that had made Morrison a Nobel laureate, Kakutani wrote in The New York Times that \u201cthe story as a whole reads like a gothic soap opera, peopled by scheming, bitter women and selfish, predatory men: women engaged in cartoon-violent catfights; men catting around and going to cathouses\u201d.</p> <p>Morrison\u2019s ninth novel, A Mercy (2008), is set in 1682 in the early years of colonial Virginia, where English, Dutch, African, Portuguese and Native Americans compete to survive and rule. Her next novel, Home (2012), moves forward to the 20th century, portraying the life of a Korean war veteran in segregated 1950s America and his attempt to save his sister from medical experiments carried out by a white doctor. It is dedicated to her son Slade, who died in 2010 aged 45, and with whom she had written several books for children. God Help the Child (2015) returns to the theme of her first novel and traces the life of a young woman in the fashion industry tormented by memories of her mother\u2019s dislike of her dark skin.</p> <p>In an interview recorded soon after the publication of Love, Morrison spoke of her lifelong concern as a writer to move away from a notion of writing by African Americans as sociology, influenced by its awareness of a white readership, and concerned with the encounter between black people and white people. She had declared in a 1998 interview: \u201cThe black narrative has always been understood to be a confrontation with some white people ... They\u2019re not terribly interesting to me. What is interesting to me is what is going on within the community. And within the community, there are no major white players. Once I thought: \u2018What is life like if they weren\u2019t there?\u2019 Which is the way we lived it, the way I lived it.\u201d</p> <p>Morrison sought to change not just the content and audience for her fiction; her desire was to create stories which could be lingered over and relished, not \u201cconsumed and gobbled as fast food\u201d, and at the same time to ensure that these stories and their characters had a strong historical and cultural base. She also compared her writing and its technique to music whose enjoyment and significance can change on a second hearing, and which has a style, structure and tone that is specifically African American. </p> <p>Born Chloe Ardelia Wofford in Lorain, Ohio, she was the second of four children of working-class parents, George Wofford, a shipyard welder, and his wife, the former Ella Ramah Willis, who had migrated to Ohio from the south. When she was about two years old her family\u2019s home was set on fire by the landlord while she and her family were in it. \u201cPeople set our house on fire to evict us,\u201d Morrison later told an interviewer, but her father refused to be intimidated by white hostility and told her that such actions merely demonstrated the inferiority of white people.</p> <p>Her parents encouraged her early interest in literature, which encompassed Austen, Flaubert and Tolstoy. But an interest in narrative and the African American tradition was also nurtured by her father, who told her stories and anecdotes he had heard as he grew up in the south. She graduated with honours from Lorain high school and studied humanities at Howard University in Washington DC, the most prestigious of the historically black universities founded in the 19th century.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dbf467fd7139e35d9922c8578ac40d5152e6a30f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dbf467fd7139e35d9922c8578ac40d5152e6a30f/0_37_3000_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Morrison receives the Nobel prize for literature from King Carl XVI Gustaf in 1993.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Morrison receives the Nobel prize for literature from King Carl XVI Gustaf in 1993.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At Howard she changed her name from Chloe to Toni (having taken the name Anthony on becoming a Roman Catholic at the age of 12), apparently because she found that people constantly mispronounced \u201cChloe\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Toni Morrison, who has died aged 88, was the only African American writer and one of the few women to have received the Nobel prize for literature. The announcement of her 1993 award cited her as a writer \u201cwho, in novels characterised by visionary force and poetic import, gives life to an essential aspect of American reality\u201d. In her acceptance speech Morrison emphasised the importance of language \u201cpartly as a system, partly as a living thing over which one has control, but mostly as an agency \u2013 as an act with consequences\u201d. She expressed her own credo, and indicated the core preoccupations of her fiction, in the fable at the heart of her speech, where she imagines young people telling an old black woman: \u201cNarrative is radical, creating us at the very moment it is being created ... For our sakes and yours forget your name in the street; tell us what the world has been to you in the dark places and in the light ... Tell us what it is to be a woman so that we may know what it is to be a man. What moves at the margin. What it is to have no home in this place. To be set adrift from the one you knew. What it is to live at the edge of towns that cannot bear your company.\u201d When she started producing fiction, she was editing other writers for the publishers Random House in New York and began to feel the lack of novels which spoke to readers such as herself. Beginning with The Bluest Eye (1969), her novels portray the psychic and social lives of African American women, as well as men, covering the trauma of slavery and its economic and psychological consequences during and after the 19th century. Her second novel, Sula (1973), provides a terse and vivid contrast between two black women, one a rebel and the other a conformist, whose stories and struggle to come to terms with one another and their community set the pattern for some of her later fiction. Song of Solomon (1977) is wider ranging historically and geographically and, unusually within Morrison\u2019s oeuvre, has a black male character, Milkman Dead, as its main protagonist. Here the elements of magic realism suggested in Sula are developed and Morrison draws on the African American myth of slaves escaping by flying away as an image of Milkman\u2019s discovery of his roots in a southern African American tradition. For this novel Morrison won the National Book Critics\u2019 Circle award. Many readers and critics on both sides of the Atlantic regard her highest achievement to be Beloved (1987), the first novel in a trilogy chronicling black American small town and urban communities over the past 150 years. It is based on a factual incident that she uncovered while preparing a historical collection, The Black Book (1974), and explores the terrible impact of slavery, its brutality and its dehumanisation, on a young mother who murders her child to prevent her being repossessed by the slave-owner from whom she has escaped. The mother and those who live with her are haunted by the memory of the dead child, and the novel is also a more general representation of the terrible history that continues to haunt African Americans, a history that must be confronted in all its anguish before black people can learn to love themselves and one another. The New York Times columnist Michiko Kakutani wrote that Beloved \u201cpossesses the heightened power and resonance of myth \u2013 its characters, like those in an opera or Greek drama, seem larger than life and their actions, too, tend to strike us as enactments of ancient rituals and passions. To describe Beloved only in these terms, however, is to diminish its immediacy, for the novel also remains precisely grounded in American reality \u2013 the reality of black history as experienced in the wake of the civil war.\u201d Beloved was awarded the Pulitzer prize for fiction in 1988, although not before a letter signed by more than 40 of America\u2019s leading black writers and scholars had decried the lack of recognition for this outstanding novel. However, the New Republic critic Stanley Crouch felt the book was over-written, and at times became trite and sentimental.

This Saturday, the first Bledisloe Cup match of the year will be played in Perth, but will the two-match series be sacrificed at the altar of the World Cup, just like Super Rugby and the Rugby Championship have been? Australia and New Zealand devalued Super Rugby when they systematically rested Test players this year, while the Wallabies, All Blacks and South Africa experimented during the first two rounds of the truncated Rugby Championship. The Wallabies won the 2015 Rugby Championship title and its precursor, the Tri Nations, in 2011, but did not receive much credit. The implication was that the Wallabies\u2019 rivals had their eyes on a bigger prize, but surely the Bledisloe Cup is worth striving for every year. We will find just out how much importance both teams place on it when the teams run out at Optus Stadium in the second part of a double-header with the women\u2019s teams on Saturday. Administrators, coaches and players increasingly believe their careers are judged almost exclusively on World Cup performance, but Australia and New Zealand cannot afford to devalue the Bledisloe \u2013 the State of Origin of Trans-Tasman rugby. It is second in importance only to the World Cup and the integrity of the series must be preserved, even in a World Cup year. There should be sufficient motivation to go all-out, given it is the major Test series before the World Cup, and the winner will head to Japan with self-belief and momentum. In his last year as All Blacks coach Steve Hansen will not want to be known as the coach who surrendered the Bledisloe Cup, while Wallabies coach Michael Cheika has an opportunity to break a 16-year drought. But there is enormous pressure on the pair to succeed at the World Cup. Hansen is aiming to coach the All Blacks (as an assistant and head coach) to an historic three-peat of World Cup victories, while Cheika has vowed to step down as Wallabies coach if they do not win the tournament. As holders the All Blacks are in a more advantageous position than the Wallabies in the Bledisloe series because they only have to win one of the two Tests \u2013 reduced from the usual three because of the World Cup \u2013 to retain the silverware. The All Blacks can secure the Cup with a win in Perth and then conduct any last-minute experiments in the second Test in Auckland the following Saturday night. Conversely, the Wallabies need to focus on winning both Tests to regain the Bledisloe Cup, something Cheika may or may not be prepared to do as part of the preparation for Japan, especially if he still has unanswered questions after Perth. In 2015 the Wallabies upset the All Blacks 27-19 in the opener in Sydney, their first win against the Kiwis in four years, but Cheika changed half his team for the second Test in Auckland and they were thrashed 41-13. It was a missed opportunity. This year the All Blacks have looked disjointed in their first two Rugby Championship Tests against Argentina and South Africa and may be uncharacteristically vulnerable.

      "bodyText": "\u201cAustralia is the only continent on the planet, other than Antarctica, that does not have high-speed rail,\u201d says the former managing director of Hitachi Consulting, Gary Fisher. Hitachi has been involved in high-speed rail since it was introduced into Japan in the 1960s and Fisher has been one of the principal enthusiasts for an Australian project. Australian politicians have been talking about it for almost as long, yet high-speed rail (above 250km/h) or even fast rail (above 200km/h) still seem a distant pipe dream. The University of Wollongong academic Philip Laird calculates $125m in today\u2019s dollars has been spent on high speed rail investigations, but not one kilometre of corridor has been reserved. \u201cHigh-speed rail has often been promised, often before elections (a Melbourne-Geelong service is the latest one) only to vanish afterwards,\u201d he says. A lack of vision and political will, short-termism, genuine concerns about viability and vested interests have all played a part in creating stumbling blocks. But now there is a renewed push, this time by state governments as well as by a few in federal parliament. It\u2019s driven by a new concern that congestion and the cost of retrofitting major cities with mass transport is crippling Australia\u2019s competitiveness and making cities unliveable. \u201cOne of the problems with high-speed rail, for too long it was seen as a method of getting from Sydney to Melbourne as an alternative to flying,\u201d says the Liberal MP John Alexander, who has chaired several inquiries into the future of cities and is now an evangelist for high-speed rail. \u201cThe real problem we are trying to address is housing supply and affordability,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause we have had no plan of settlement, we have had an imbalance of settlement. It has resulted in congestion in our major cities and the second highest cost of housing in the world.\u201d Alexander has seen the impacts first hand. His electorate of Bennelong, centred on Epping in Sydney\u2019s middle ring, is feeling the pressure as the city has expanded. Roads into the city are clogged, trains are full and there have been big increases in housing density around railway stations. The median price of a suburban bungalow has risen to $1.5m and houses often sell for close to $3m. With high-speed rail, he says, \u201cGosford, the southern highlands and Wollongong could be 15 minutes from the centre of Sydney and Newcastle, Goulburn and Nowra 30 minutes\u201d. \u201cYou are uplifting the value of that land enormously to compete with one of the most expensive markets in the world. \u201cYou can reduce the number of cars coming into Sydney and you can strategically rebalance our settlement.\u201d The Very Fast Train that never arrived In the past most of the focus has been on a Sydney \u2013 Canberra \u2013 Melbourne line. In the early 1980s, Paul Wild, the head of the CSIRO, returned from a trip to Japan inspired by his travel on the Shinkansen, and urged the federal government to consider what was then known as the Very Fast Train linking the three capitals. The prime minister, Bob Hawke, was hooked and set the ball rolling. The scheme was backed by BHP, Elders IXL, Kumagai Gumi and TNT, who proposed that the project would be funded entirely by the private sector. Over objections from the bureaucracy, the VFT joint venture proceeded through a feasibility study but was abandoned in 1991, primarily because it failed to secure tax changes from the federal government that it claimed would have made it financially viable. The deregulation of the airline industry, which has slashed airfares, also helped undermine the economics of Melbourne to Sydney high-speed rail. Sydney to Melbourne is now the world\u2019s second busiest domestic air route, with 54,519 flights a year and the airlines have become highly protective of this lucrative part of their business. Since the failure of the VFT project there have periodic attempts to revive the concept. The latest was between 2010 and 2013 when the former Labor government produced a two-stage report on high-speed rail between Brisbane and Melbourne. It went nowhere. In 2017 the Morrison/Turnbull government embarked on the latest attempt to explore either fast rail or high-speed rail by allocating $20m to fund business cases for such schemes. They include studies for high-speed rail between Melbourne and Shepparton, which is being proposed by a private sector consortium, and two fast-rail projects: Sydney to Newcastle and Brisbane to the Sunshine Coast. The latter two have state involvement. But there are question marks over the private consortium, Consolidated Land and Rail Australia, that won funding for the Melbourne-Shepparton business case and which has designs on a much grander plan: a high-speed line between Melbourne and Sydney funded by eight new cities along the route. The federal government has given the consortium $8m towards development of the business case, although it has no shareholders with experience in construction of major projects. Laird says the latest federal government initiative of seed funding is welcome, but more details are needed. The National Faster Rail agency was established on 1 July, but so far it has only an acting chief executive, Malcolm Southwell from the Department of Infrastructure. There is no expert committee yet, so no one is moving at high speed to get these projects rolling. A piecemeal alternative It may well be that states will drive the push to faster rail, if not high-speed rail. Laird says Victoria is the most advanced, and there is a good case for pursuing the more modest goal, given the difficulties of making progress on high-speed rail. \u201cAustralia could follow the lead of Germany and other countries in building isolated new sections of track to high-speed standards, one at a time. These sections can link with existing mainlines, to allow for new trains to run faster than cars,\u201d he says. This is the approach taken by Victoria, where some track can already run trains at 160km/h and more sections are planned. During the federal election campaign the Coalition promised $2bn to upgrade the line between Melbourne and Geelong, which would cut the journey to just 32 minutes. Scott Morrison said the project would take pressure off the Princes Freeway, which normally carries more than 54,000 vehicles a day. Another $40m has been promised to fund businesses cases for five rail corridors, including Melbourne to Albury-Wodonga, and Melbourne to Traralgon in the Latrobe Valley. NSW lags much further behind, although the premier, Gladys Berejiklian, says faster rail is now a priority. Laird notes that it will be a much bigger and more expensive task for NSW. Many of its mainline tracks have \u201csteam age\u201d alignments with tight curves, making intercity train speeds much too slow without spending large sums to realign the tracks, he says. The NSW government has retained Prof Andrew MacNaughton, who has worked on the UK\u2019s hugely controversial HS2 project, to advise on options for high-speed rail or track upgrades to enable faster rail. The study involves main lines from Sydney to Newcastle, Orange, Canberra and Wollongong. A spokesman for Transport for NSW said the NSW government would prepare a high-level strategy this year and planning would take place over the next four years. \u201cA key consideration of the strategy is the development of a staged approach to ensure that each stage delivers immediate benefits while stepping closer to the game-changing vision,\u201d a spokesperson said. The federal government has chipped in with $5m towards the business case for the Newcastle line. But these sums for business cases represent only the tiniest fraction of what needs to be spent to turn vision into reality. Alexander says government will almost certainly need to play a role in the most ambitious projects, such as the Sydney \u2013 Canberra \u2013 Melbourne line. \u201cMy view has always been: why wouldn\u2019t you make it a giant public-private partnership?\u201d he says. Without a federal hand in driving progress, particularly towards a Sydney-Melbourne line, the very fast train has every chance of going metaphorically off the rails once again. A good start would be to reserve the critical rail corridors that will be needed for high-speed lines. \u2022 Next: the former politicians who see profit in high-speed rail",

      "bodyText": "Australians are overwhelmingly concerned about the power of Google and Facebook and want them held to account for the proliferation of fake news online, according to the latest Guardian Essential poll. The survey of more than 1,000 voters has also found strong support for tighter regulation of the digital media giants, as the government prepares to crack down on the sector following an 18-month digital platforms inquiry undertaken by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. Eighty per cent of those surveyed reported that they were concerned about how Facebook and Google collected and used personal information, while 75% of participants agreed that the platforms were responsible for distributing deliberately misleading and harmful news stories. Only 31% of people said they were not interested in how the tech giants used personal data to target advertisements when using the sites. Support for a specialist body to oversee the operations of Facebook and Google was 75%, while 80% agreed with the more general principle that there needed to be \u201ctighter regulation\u201d. Older Australians expressed the strongest support for cracking down on the sector, with almost 9o% of those aged over 55 backing better regulations, compared with 76% of those aged 18 to 54. The finding comes after the ACCC\u2019s final report, released last week, made 23 recommendations to better regulate the dominant tech giants, with the Coalition agreeing to the recommendation to establish a new regulating division that will investigate, monitor and enforce issues of monopoly power and breaches of privacy law. It will consider its position with regard to the other 22 recommendations and report back by the end of the year. According to the report, 19.2 million Australians use Google every month, 17.6 million use YouTube (owned by Google), 17.3 million use Facebook and 11.2 million use Facebook-owned Instagram. Voter concern about the proliferation of fake news on social media comes after Labor raised concerns with Facebook about a death tax misinformation campaign in the lead-up to the May federal election. But despite the circulation of false information, Facebook told the Labor party it had no role to remove content that one side of a political debate \u201cconsiders to be false\u201d. The communications minister, Paul Fletcher, has expressed sympathy with Facebook, telling Guardian Australia that the social media giant does not hold itself out as a traditional media publisher with editorial standards. Amid growing concern about the power and influence of Google and Facebook, the ACCC recommended that digital platforms implement a code of conduct to govern how they handle complaints about the spread of inaccurate information, which would be registered and enforced by an independent regulator such as the Australian Communications and Media Authority. The Essential poll, undertaken from 1-5 August, also gauged voter support for the current rate of Newstart, with almost 60% of people believing the Newstart benefit of about $280 a week was too low for a single person with no children. About 30% said they thought the amount was \u201cabout right\u201d while 5% said it was too high. Two-thirds of Labor voters were concerned that the Newstart benefit was too low, compared with about 50% of Coalition voters. When asked about lifting the rate from $280 to $355 a week, 75% of people were in favour, with Greens and Labor voters more likely to strongly support an increase to Newstart (63% and 55%) than Coalition voters (29%). Amid growing calls from the the Greens, Labor, welfare and business groups \u2013 and from government MPs \u2013 for the rate to be changed the prime minister, Scott Morrison, has ruled out raising Newstart beyond the usual indexation levels, saying his focus is on finding jobs for the unemployed. But while Morrison has criticised advocates for what he said was \u201cunfunded empathy\u201d for Newstart recipients, the Essential survey found that almost three-quarters of people believe politicians are \u201cout of touch\u201d. The poll finds that low-income earners are most concerned about the current payment, with 68% saying it is too low compared with mid and high-income earners (55% and 51% respectively). Both Labor and Coalition voters said they would prefer the government prioritise spending on Newstart over \u201ca tax cut for Australia\u2019s top income earners\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Landowners across Victoria are facing a multimillion-dollar clean-up bill after the discovery of tens of thousands of tonnes of previously unknown recycling stockpiled at sites rented by failed company SKM. On Friday, creditors of SKM Corporate, which leased the sites and is at the centre of a recycling crisis gripping Victoria, obtained orders from the state\u2019s supreme court liquidating the company. Following fires at its properties and a series of bans imposed by the Environment Protection Authority that the company said crippled its operations, SKM last month told 30 local councils it could no longer accept about 300,000 tonnes a year of recycling. Under a state government contingency plan, up to 60% of that recycling is being sent to landfill, with the remainder being handled by other industry players. On Friday, shortly after the court appointed David Ross, of Hall Chadwick, to liquidate the company, the Commonwealth Bank, which is believed to be owed about $50m, moved to protect its position by appointing Brendan Richards and Peter McCluskey of KPMG as receivers. It is believed about 60,000 tonnes of recycling is stored at properties rented from parties not associated with the family that controls SKM, on top of 10,000 tonnes stored at SKM\u2019s facilities, which the company also leased. Action taken by Ross on Monday means landowners are now potentially on the hook to pay to send all 70,000 tonnes to landfill at an estimated cost of more than $10m. SKM Corporate is just one of about 10 companies that together operated as the SKM group. It is believed to have few or no assets and, after laying off about 15 workers shortly before Ross was appointed, no employees. The Commonwealth Bank is expected to appoint receivers over most or all of the remaining companies in the SKM group by the end of the week. On Monday, Ross used a provision of the law allowing liquidators to disclaim onerous property to void the leases over 12 properties. The properties include SKM\u2019s headquarters in Melbourne suburb Laverton North and the company\u2019s Tasmanian depot, but also take in locations in western and northern Melbourne. \u201cThey stored some of their recycling at these premises,\u201d Ross told the Guardian. He said that if he had not disclaimed the leases he would have been personally liable for the cost of cleaning up the mess. \u201cAs the bank has appointed over the assets I am totally unfunded at this point,\u201d he said. He said he empathised with landowners who now face unexpected clean-up bills. \u201cIf it was me I wouldn\u2019t be ecstatic either,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m trying to deal with the EPA to see if there is something they can do, but I haven\u2019t heard back from them.\u201d An EPA spokesman said the agency had spoken to both Ross and the receivers. Ross said creditors were likely to be owed far more than the $5.5m claimed during the court proceedings. In addition to the CBA, Westpac is also a lender to a company in the SKM group, but it is believed to be owed less than $10m. A CBA spokesman said that before appointing receivers to SKM the bank had \u201cbeen working closely and cooperatively with this customer for an extended period of time\u201d. Richards said KPMG would work \u201cclosely with state and local governments to minimise the impact to the community and to provide certainty to all stakeholders.\u201d For the over 30 Victorian councils affected by SKM\u2019s insolvency, Friday\u2019s decision was not unexpected, but they are still working through a solution. While some have made contingency plans with some of SKM\u2019s competitors to fill the gap, at least half are believed to still be sending recycling to landfill. City of Melbourne confirmed on Monday it was sending 45 tonnes per day of recycling to landfill since SKM stopped taking the city\u2019s recycling. The Municipal Association of Victoria president, Cr Coral Ross, said in an update this week that before the court ruling she met with the environment minister, Lily D\u2019Ambrosio, to seek support from the state government to increase capacity at non-SKM facilities, and for more assistance when the recycling does need to go into landfill. \u201cWhere councils have to send to landfill as a last resort, we are seeking for the state to provide some relief on the landfill levy and funding assistance for additional transport costs incurred as a result of the shutdowns,\u201d she said. The councils involved are pushing for the introduction of a container deposit scheme, which has been ruled out by the government, and a number of other changes to help fix the recycling system. The changes would include more recycling facilities in Victoria, better regulation of the recycling companies, and investigating separating glass out from the rest of kerbside recycling materials to reduce contamination. Meanwhile, the Metropolitan Waste and Resource Recovery Group is advancing plans for 60 councils to form 11 clusters and embark on collaborative procurements to offer large contracts to market for recycling in the state. Expressions of interest will go out this month, with contracts expected to be in place by June 2020.",

He adds another dimension to this England bowling attack \u2013 he\u2019s got pace, bounce, movement off the seam, through the air. Four-day cricket, five-day cricket is his best format to appreciate how good he is.\u201d That claim stands up to scrutiny, given Archer\u2019s first-class average is 23.44, compared with 27.59 in List A cricket. He certainly looked ready in this match, striking twice in his first spell and peppering the inexperienced Gloucestershire team with plenty of short balls. One interested spectator was Chris Jordan, Archer\u2019s fellow Barbadian and Sussex teammate. \u201cHe\u2019s been good ever since the World Cup,\u201d said Jordan. \u201cHe had that week break [in Barbados] which did him a lot of good, freed his mind, rested his body and, as you can see from the couple of T20s he\u2019s played and a session here today, he\u2019s more than ready. \u201cYou see that every time a challenge is put in front of him he seems to rise to it. He\u2019s very competitive and he sets himself high standards and he\u2019ll be looking to live up to those. So going into the second Test, he\u2019ll be a big, big asset for England.\u201d",

The confession was obtained under oppression given the threats made, that she was not cautioned, and that she was not given access to a lawyer as was her right under the Cypriot constitution and European convention on human rights,\u201d Polak said. Before being formally charged at 2.30am local time after eight hours of questioning, he claimed the teenager had sent text messages to friends saying police were preventing her from contacting anyone else. \u201c[She] was not told that she could leave the police station nor given the option of leaving at any point,\u201d Polak said. The island\u2019s police spokesman, Christos Andreou, rejected the Briton\u2019s claims. Calling the accusations \u201cbaseless\u201d, he said: \u201cThe Cypriot police insist that the 19-year-old Briton freely asked to make a second deposition in which she retracted everything that she had claimed in the first she had made.\u201d He claimed it was impossible for the teenager to have conversed with friends via text message, as her mobile phone had been taken away from her as soon as she was arrested. The woman\u2019s lawyer, Andreas Pittadjis, last week asked for the case to be adjourned so he could gather evidence, including a video that had gone viral purporting to show several men having sex with the woman. He said the circulation of the video clip on the internet was \u201ca much more serious offence than what my client faces\u201d. As diplomatic ties have warmed between the two countries, the Mediterranean island has become increasingly popular among young Israelis with many heading straight for Ayia Napa, which is famous for its all-night bars, sandy beaches and seemingly endless revelry. An estimated 1.3 million holidaymakers fly to the island from Britain each year. Pittadjis would not reveal how the teenager will plead in court on Wednesday.",

Khadijah became the first jockey to ride in \u2013 and win \u2013 a race in Britain wearing a hijab. The job of steering Haverland to glory in the Magnolia Cup took not much more than a minute. It is a minute that Khadijah has been reliving endlessly since. \u201cI\u2019ve spent a lot of time talking to people about my race, it\u2019s been a busy few days.

In this country ITV has given the green light to a documentary about her journey in horse racing, to be called Riding A Dream and due on screens in the autumn. Khadijah radiates a sense of unreality that any of this is happening to her, as well she may. In January, impending A level exams were the biggest thing in her calendar, before the ITV Racing presenter Oli Bell, a patron of the Ebony Riding School in Brixton where she occasionally rode, started to think she might be a suitable candidate for an ambitious project.

      "bodyText": "On Valentine\u2019s Day this year, Narendra Modi went on a date with Bear Grylls. As the two men set off on an \u201cadventure of a lifetime\u201d in India\u2019s Corbett national park, 500 miles to the north in the valley of Kashmir a suicide bomber drove a truck laden with explosives into a convoy of vehicles carrying Indian paramilitary forces. Forty troops were blown to bits in the blast. It was the bloodiest single atrocity suffered by Indian security personnel in the savage history of the Kashmir conflict. A trailer for Grylls\u2019 programme Man vs Wild, released last week by Discovery, shows the duo wandering the wilderness that afternoon, sniffing animal excrement and sharing laughs and survival techniques. Opposition politicians have seized on the film to accuse the Indian prime minister of not interrupting his escapade with Grylls immediately on news of the atrocity \u2013 a charge the government has denied. Either way, Modi, a consummate method actor, was playing \u201cthe conservationist\u201d. He added this role to an extensive repertoire \u2013 poet, sage, statesman, he-man, yogi \u2013 that he has deftly deployed to craft a cult of personality unrivalled in the democratic world, not least for a man who was once widely castigated as a Hindu supremacist.

Anderson pulled up lame after just four overs of bowling proved catastrophic to Joe Root\u2019s side at Edgbaston, with Steve Smith feasting on a resulting four-man attack for centuries in both innings that propelled Australia to a 251-run win. Stuart Broad revealed his strike partner was \u201cdistraught\u201d at letting his teammates down while Root tried to describe the injury as a \u201cfreak\u201d after the Test given Anderson had passed the fitness tests and the decision to select the 37\u2011year\u2011old was \u201cunanimous\u201d.

Vidal highlighted that \u201cmany in areas of high growth want fewer children but cannot access contraception\u201d, and as CEO of a global organisation providing women and girls with access to family planning, I agree. More than 214 million women and girls worldwide are unable to access contraception. Yet we know that when they have access to contraception and safe abortion, they often choose, like Meghan, to have smaller families.</p> <p>Women are increasingly and disproportionately bearing the burden of the climate crisis. It often falls on women to care for growing families in worsening conditions. Droughts mean limited access to food and water. Rising sea levels lead to floods. Humans and animals are competing for dwindling resources, especially in countries that contribute least to global carbon emissions.</p> <p>By 2050, populations in low and middle income countries are expected to more than double to 1.7 billion \u2013 and offering women real choice in contraception to empower them to determine their futures in the face of the climate crisis is something that can no longer be overlooked.

      "bodyText": "John Vidal hit the nail on the head by linking Meghan and Harry\u2019s choice to limit their family size for the sake of the climate to the lack of access many women globally have to services that would enable them to make the same choice (Having kids is bad for the planet. So are the royal jets, 1 August). Vidal highlighted that \u201cmany in areas of high growth want fewer children but cannot access contraception\u201d, and as CEO of a global organisation providing women and girls with access to family planning, I agree. More than 214 million women and girls worldwide are unable to access contraception. Yet we know that when they have access to contraception and safe abortion, they often choose, like Meghan, to have smaller families. Women are increasingly and disproportionately bearing the burden of the climate crisis. It often falls on women to care for growing families in worsening conditions. Droughts mean limited access to food and water. Rising sea levels lead to floods. Humans and animals are competing for dwindling resources, especially in countries that contribute least to global carbon emissions. By 2050, populations in low and middle income countries are expected to more than double to 1.7 billion \u2013 and offering women real choice in contraception to empower them to determine their futures in the face of the climate crisis is something that can no longer be overlooked. Women want it, the world needs it, and governments must take action to increase access to family planning now. Simon Cooke CEO, Marie Stopes International \u2022 You write that \u201cPoorer countries, which broadly speaking are the least to blame for the climate crisis \u2013 emitting less carbon dioxide per capita \u2013 will suffer most\u201d (Editorial, 1 August). As overseas development charities like Cafod witness every day, there is no \u201cwill\u201d about it. Poor people in poorer countries have been suffering the effects of climate change for many years. A 2013 DfID-funded paper found: \u201cThis analysis provides evidence that a drought in East Africa such as seen in 2011 has become more probable as a result of anthropogenic climate change.\u201d The drought affected 10 million people in Ethiopia, Djibouti, Somalia, Kenya, Sudan and Uganda. Many of whom would have migrated, some possibly to Europe. David Murray Wallington, Surrey \u2022 There is a silver lining to the dark cloud of the insulting and offensive comments made by Andrew Bolt about Greta Thunberg (Thunberg hits back at columnist who mocked her autism, 3 August). The fact that Bolt has resorted to such a personal attack on her means he has no credible arguments against the substance and science of what she is telling the world about the seriousness of climate change. Small comfort for Ms Thunberg perhaps, but telling. Harvey Sanders London \u2022 Mark Carney is right to stress the need for urgent action to tackle climate change.

Then in the morning: \u201cBam, there\u2019s a curfew, internet is cut, telephone lines are snapped, you can\u2019t make any kind of communication,\u201d he says. Outside, access to main roads in Srinagar, the largest city in Indian-administered Kashmir, had been blocked.</p> \n<p>Hours later, the Indian government announced the most radical change any government has suggested for Kashmir since the region joined the Indian union.<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/05/india-revoke-disputed-kashmir-special-status\"> It would revoke Kashmir\u2019s special status</a> and divide the state in two.</p> \n<p>The move immediately angered Pakistan, which also claims Kashmir, and provoked warnings from China, which holds a thinly populated area in the disputed region.</p> \n<p>In Kashmir, people watched the news unfold on TV, the only source of information, and began to meet on the streets in residential areas, where some movement was still allowed. \u201cBecause the internet was down, telephones were down, so people congregated in small groups everywhere within the residential areas \u2026 There was this apprehension that things are going to get worse because this is what India does,\u201d said Siraj, who spoke to the Guardian after flying to Delhi on Monday night.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"1a6ba9a1-6cf4-4c41-97ae-7af3f3152187\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>Who controls Kashmir?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The region in the foothills of the Himalayas has been under dispute since&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/india\">India</a>&nbsp;and Pakistan came into being in 1947.</p>\n    <p>Both claim it in full, but each controls a section of the territory, separated by one of the world's most heavily militarised borders: the \u2018line of control\u2019 based on a ceasefire border established after a 1947-48 war. China controls another part in the east.<br></p>\n    <p>India and Pakistan have gone to war a further two times over Kashmir, most recently in 1999. Artillery, mortar and small arms fire are still frequently exchanged.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How did the dispute start?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>After the partition of colonial India in 1947, small, semi-autonomous \u2018princely states\u2019 across the subcontinent were being folded into India or Pakistan. The ruler of Kashmir dithered over which to join until tribal fighters entered from Pakistan intent on taking the region for Islamabad.</p>\n    <p>Kashmir asked Delhi for assistance, signing a treaty of accession in exchange for the intervention of Indian troops, who fought the Pakistanis to the modern-day line of control.</p>\n    <p>In 1948, the UN security council called for a referendum in Kashmir to determine which country the region would join or whether it would become an independent state. The referendum has never been held.</p>\n    <p>In its 1950 constitution, India granted Kashmir a large measure of independence. But since then it has eroded some of that autonomy and repeatedly intervened to rig elections and dismiss and jail democratically elected leaders.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What was Kashmir\u2019s special status?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Kashmir\u2019s special status, given in exchange for joining the Indian union, had been in place since 14 May 1954. Under article 370, the state was given a separate constitution, a flag, and autonomy over all matters except for foreign affairs and defence.&nbsp;<br></p>\n    <p>An additional provision, article 35a, prevented people from outside the state buying land in the territory. Many Kashmiris believed this was crucial to protecting the demography of the Muslim-majority state and its way of life.</p>\n    <p>The ruling Bharatiya Janata party repeatedly promised to scrap such rules, a long-term demand of its Hindu nationalist support base. But analysts warned doing so would almost certainly ignite unrest.</p>\n    <p>On Wednesday 31 October 2019, the government formally revoked Kashmir\u2019s special status. The government argued that the provision had&nbsp; only ever intended to be temporary and that scrapping it would boost investment in Kashmir. Critics, however, said the move would escalate tensions with Pakistan \u2013 which quickly called India\u2019s actions illegal \u2013 and fuel resentment in Kashmir, where there is an insurgency against Indian rule.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What do the militants want?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>There has been an armed insurgency against Indian rule over its section of Kashmir for the past three decades. Indian soldiers and Pakistan-backed guerrillas fought a war rife with accusations of torture, forced disappearances and extra-judicial killing.<br></p>\n    <p>Until 2004, the militancy was made up largely of Pakistani and Afghan fighters. Since then, especially after protests were quashed with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/08/india-crackdown-in-kashmir-is-this-worlds-first-mass-blinding\">extreme force</a>&nbsp;in 2016, locals have made up a growing share of the anti-India fighters.</p>\n    <p>For Indians, control of Kashmir \u2013 part of the country\u2019s only Muslim-majority state \u2013 has been proof of its commitment to religious pluralism. For Pakistan, a state founded as a homeland for south Asian Muslims, it is the last occupied home of its co-religionists. <br><b><br>Michael Safi and Rebecca Ratcliffe</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Concerns had mounted over the last week as a series of government orders leaked to the media began to provoke panic.

An extra 10,000 troops were sent to the already heavily militarised territory, prompting fears Delhi might be about to remove Kashmir\u2019s special status.</p> \n<p>Rumours intensified further when, in an unprecedented move, the government curtailed a Hindu pilgrimage to a Himalayan cave shrine \u2013 a 45-day trek that about 300,000 people had embarked upon since July.

      "bodyText": "When Gauhar Siraj woke on Monday, he realised something was about to happen. He\u2019d travelled to Kashmir for a wedding, and tension had been building all week. Then in the morning: \u201cBam, there\u2019s a curfew, internet is cut, telephone lines are snapped, you can\u2019t make any kind of communication,\u201d he says. Outside, access to main roads in Srinagar, the largest city in Indian-administered Kashmir, had been blocked. Hours later, the Indian government announced the most radical change any government has suggested for Kashmir since the region joined the Indian union. It would revoke Kashmir\u2019s special status and divide the state in two. The move immediately angered Pakistan, which also claims Kashmir, and provoked warnings from China, which holds a thinly populated area in the disputed region. In Kashmir, people watched the news unfold on TV, the only source of information, and began to meet on the streets in residential areas, where some movement was still allowed. \u201cBecause the internet was down, telephones were down, so people congregated in small groups everywhere within the residential areas \u2026 There was this apprehension that things are going to get worse because this is what India does,\u201d said Siraj, who spoke to the Guardian after flying to Delhi on Monday night. Concerns had mounted over the last week as a series of government orders leaked to the media began to provoke panic.

The request could mark a new tactic in Moscow\u2019s attempts to quash recent political protests, which have led to more than 2,000 people being detained, including dozens of underage demonstrators. Prosecutors said on Tuesday that they had asked a court to remove the parental rights of a couple from Moscow because they had given the child to another protester, who had \u201cput the child\u2019s health and life in danger\u201d. The boy\u2019s father, Dmitry Prokazov, told the Russian service of RFE/RL that he was \u201cabsolutely innocent\u201d and had given the child to a friend \u2013 and relative of the boy\u2019s mother \u2013 as they left the protest. Prokazov said investigators searched his house after a video of the handover was broadcast on television. The couple were summoned for questioning on Tuesday. The friend, an activist named Sergei Fomin, is currently being sought by police as part of an investigation into \u201cmass unrest\u201d during a protest on 27 July, and he faces up to eight years in prison under the charges. No video has been released showing Fomin endangering the child. Yulia Gorbunova, a researcher for Human Rights Watch, said the move to relieve the couple of their parental rights appeared to be an \u201cintimidation tactic and was meant to instil fear\u201d.

Russia\u2019s opposition has held large protests for the past two weekends after independent candidates were disbarred from an election to Moscow\u2019s municipal legislature. The demonstrations have been forcibly dispersed by police, who have arrested more than 1,000 protesters at each rally.

      "bodyText": "Stephen Colbert In the wake of the mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, that killed 31 people this weekend, Stephen Colbert compared America\u2019s gun culture to the melting nuclear core at Chernobyl. Over and over again in HBO\u2019s show depicting the USSR\u2019s nuclear disaster, Colbert explained, \u201ca scientist or engineer will tell a politician: \u2018Hey, we\u2019ve got a real problem here. The nuclear core is going to melt down and kill everyone.\u2019 But the politicians refuse to believe it, because the acknowledgment of failure threatens their position of power, and their power is more important than saving any lives. \u201cI think at this point, it\u2019s clear that America\u2019s gun culture is melting down,\u201d Colbert continued. \u201cBut the Republicans in Congress would rather maintain their power than save lives.\u201d For example, Colbert pointed to two bipartisan bills that would establish background checks, slowing the purchase of guns, that have passed the House.

Three people were taken to hospital after the incident and each was later discharged.</p> \n<p>One passenger, Gayle Fitzpatrick, described anxiety among passengers as the incident unfolded. \u201cIt was very scary,\u201d she said. \u201cThe flight was just ending, and with 10 minutes to go, it started descending rapidly as smoke started to fill the cabin.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"4dbeb586-f53e-490f-abc2-a935130e4213\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FsTa3HlmuBo?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cThere were no communications from the crew, who started to wear full oxygen masks and protective fire wear.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cEventually they managed to open the emergency doors and told us to go down the chutes. There were fire engines waiting and then we were all ushered into a bus to the airport.\u201d</p> \n<p>Unite, the UK and Ireland\u2019s largest union, has called for an inquiry into toxic cabin air and fume events on board jet airliners following Monday\u2019s incident.</p> \n<p>Describing the event as the tip of the iceberg, Unite called on the airline industry to \u201ccome clean\u201d over toxic cabin air and \u201cclean up\u201d its act by using safer oil to lubricate jet engines and fitting cabin air filters on board planes.</p> \n<p>Howard Beckett, Unite\u2019s assistant general secretary for legal affairs, said: \u201cThis latest fume event is deeply alarming. British Airways has some serious questions to answer regarding the safety of the aircraft, in addition to providing health and safety guarantees for our cabin crew members.</p> \n<p>Unite said it is currently supporting 51 high court actions against five UK airlines after they said they found evidence that the air in most commercial airline cabins can cause irreversible neurological damage and chronic illness among susceptible individuals.</p> \n<p>Beckett added: \u201cFar too often fume events like these go unreported and are brushed under the carpet by the airline industry. This latest fume event only came to light because members of the media were on board the flight. The airline industry cannot continue to hide from the issue of toxic cabin air whilst placing the health and safety of aircrew at risk.\u201d</p> \n<p>Brian Strutton, the general secretary of the British Airline Pilots\u2019 Association, said the aircraft clearly suffered a technical problem, the cause of which will need to be investigated.</p> \n<p>Strutton praised the pilot and crew for their \u201cexcellent and highly professional job of getting this aircraft safely on to the ground in very difficult circumstances, and safely evacuating all the passengers with no reported serious injuries.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe will await the accident report, but this looks to have been a very well-managed emergency situation, and overall a good outcome, and I pay tribute to the pilots and crew for a job very well done.\u201d</p> \n<p>A spokesperson for the Professional Pilots Union said: \u201cAll the crew on that aircraft did what they\u2019re trained for brilliantly, and they\u2019re a credit to all of us in the industry. Pilots and crew are the face of the company in these situations, and airlines would do well to remember that when negotiating with the unions representing these fantastic people.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Aviation unions have praised British Airway pilots and cabin crew for landing their plane safely and evacuating all passengers after their aircraft filled with smoke. One of the unions called for an inquiry into the incident in which nearly 200 people had to be evacuated from a British Airways flight after smoke poured into the cabin minutes before it was due to land in Valencia on Monday. Three people were taken to hospital after the incident and each was later discharged. One passenger, Gayle Fitzpatrick, described anxiety among passengers as the incident unfolded. \u201cIt was very scary,\u201d she said. \u201cThe flight was just ending, and with 10 minutes to go, it started descending rapidly as smoke started to fill the cabin. \u201cThere were no communications from the crew, who started to wear full oxygen masks and protective fire wear.\u201d \u201cEventually they managed to open the emergency doors and told us to go down the chutes. There were fire engines waiting and then we were all ushered into a bus to the airport.\u201d Unite, the UK and Ireland\u2019s largest union, has called for an inquiry into toxic cabin air and fume events on board jet airliners following Monday\u2019s incident. Describing the event as the tip of the iceberg, Unite called on the airline industry to \u201ccome clean\u201d over toxic cabin air and \u201cclean up\u201d its act by using safer oil to lubricate jet engines and fitting cabin air filters on board planes. Howard Beckett, Unite\u2019s assistant general secretary for legal affairs, said: \u201cThis latest fume event is deeply alarming. British Airways has some serious questions to answer regarding the safety of the aircraft, in addition to providing health and safety guarantees for our cabin crew members. Unite said it is currently supporting 51 high court actions against five UK airlines after they said they found evidence that the air in most commercial airline cabins can cause irreversible neurological damage and chronic illness among susceptible individuals. Beckett added: \u201cFar too often fume events like these go unreported and are brushed under the carpet by the airline industry. This latest fume event only came to light because members of the media were on board the flight. The airline industry cannot continue to hide from the issue of toxic cabin air whilst placing the health and safety of aircrew at risk.\u201d Brian Strutton, the general secretary of the British Airline Pilots\u2019 Association, said the aircraft clearly suffered a technical problem, the cause of which will need to be investigated. Strutton praised the pilot and crew for their \u201cexcellent and highly professional job of getting this aircraft safely on to the ground in very difficult circumstances, and safely evacuating all the passengers with no reported serious injuries. \u201cWe will await the accident report, but this looks to have been a very well-managed emergency situation, and overall a good outcome, and I pay tribute to the pilots and crew for a job very well done.\u201d A spokesperson for the Professional Pilots Union said: \u201cAll the crew on that aircraft did what they\u2019re trained for brilliantly, and they\u2019re a credit to all of us in the industry. Pilots and crew are the face of the company in these situations, and airlines would do well to remember that when negotiating with the unions representing these fantastic people.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Dementia is the biggest health crisis of our time, experts have said, as statistics show the condition was the primary cause of death in England and Wales last year. Almost one in eight people died from dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease in 2018, with the proportion increasing for the fourth consecutive year \u2013 up from 12.7% in 2017 to 12.8% in 2018. There were 541,589 deaths registered in England and Wales last year, the highest total since 1999. With the numbers of people living with dementia in the UK expected to rise to 1 million by 2021, campaigners are urging the government to fulfil its pledges on adult social care, including publishing its long-awaited green paper. In his first speech as prime minister, Boris Johnson vowed to solve the UK\u2019s social care crisis \u201conce and for all\u201d, asserting that he would protect the elderly from the fear of having to sell their home to pay for the cost of care. Sally Copley, the director of policy and campaigns at Alzheimer\u2019s Society, said: \u201cFor four years now, we\u2019ve seen deaths caused by dementia increase. We need to take action now to tackle the biggest health crisis of our time. One person develops dementia in the UK every three minutes and there are still far too many facing a future alone, without adequate support. \u201cThere has never been a more urgent need for the government, the NHS, the research community and society to unite with us against this devastating condition. We need the government to prioritise dementia with a dedicated NHS dementia fund and invest in a plan for long-term social care reform.\u201d The increase in the numbers of those developing dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease was a result of people living longer, surviving other illnesses and of the syndrome being better understood by doctors, said the Office for National Statistics (ONS) report published on Tuesday. But with the number of people with dementia living alone expected to double by 2040, experts say people deserve to see the same life-changing breakthroughs that have benefitted other major disease areas, such as cancer, made in the treatment of dementia. \u201cRight now, we have no way to slow, stop or treat the diseases that cause dementia but with the right support, research can change this,\u201d said Dr Alison Evans, the head of policy at Alzheimer\u2019s Research UK, said. \u201cThe UK government currently only invests 0.3% of the annual cost of dementia towards research and this is pitifully low. We\u2019ve called on the government and our new prime minister to join countries around the world and commit to put the equivalent of just 1% of the cost of dementia towards research.\u201d Caroline Abrahams, the charity director at Age UK, said: \u201cOlder people living with long-term health conditions like dementia who need social care are suffering every day in huge numbers because they do not get the care they need. \u201cOver a million are living with unmet needs for care and many more are being turned down for care or simply cannot access any in their area. Most tragically of all, many have died waiting for their care to be put in place. This is simply unacceptable.\u201d The mortality rates were released on the same day the ONS published data that revealed vacancy rates in adult social care in the public sector were running at an 8% high, equating to 110,000 vacancies \u2013 among the highest rates across all public services. The report warned that, with a growing ageing population pushing up demand for labour, vacancy rates in adult social care services could increase further. Barbara Keeley, the shadow minister for social care and mental health, said: \u201cThese statistics show that dementia is set to be one of the biggest challenges for the health and social care system over the coming years, and the social care system just isn\u2019t equipped to provide the level of care that people with dementia need.\u201d \u201cA decade of Tory cuts to council budgets has seen \u00a37.7bn less funding for social care and it\u2019s often people with dementia and their families who are paying the price. It\u2019s time for the government to come forward with proposals for much-needed reform of social care. She said a Labour government would invest \u00a38bn extra in social care, providing additional publicly funded care packages to ensure more people get the support they they needed. Mortality rates from dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease are highest for women, accounting for 16.7% of all reported deaths, and rising to 23.6% for women over 80. The leading cause of death for men continues to be ischaemic heart disease, but for men aged 80 and over, dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease is the biggest cause, at 15.1% of all reported deaths. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \u201cDementia is a major health and care challenge and we\u2019re working to improve care and support to make this the best country in the world to live with the condition. \u201cWe have given local authorities access to nearly \u00a34bn more dedicated funding for adult social care this year, and a further \u00a3410m is available for adults and children\u2019s services.

The millimetre-long animals, sometimes known as water bears or moss piglets after their favoured environment and food, resemble cheerful eight-legged maggots wearing distinctly sphincter-like faces.</p> <p>But it is not their appearance that has made their name. Tardigrades are considered the hardiest animals on Earth. They have been found on mountain tops, in scorching deserts, and lurking in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/jan/18/antarctica-tardigrades-crustaceans-mercer-subglacial-lake\">subglacial lakes</a> in Antarctica. In his book <a href=\"http://www.karlshuker.com/hidden_powers.htm\">The Hidden Powers of Animals</a>, Dr Karl Shuker claimed the beasts survived being frozen in liquid helium and being boiled at 149C.</p> <p>The tardigrade\u2019s secret is the ability to shrivel into a seed-like pod, expelling nearly all of its water and slashing its metabolism. In this \u201ctun\u201d state, the animals can hunker down and survive conditions that would normally be swiftly fatal. In 2007, scientists discovered that inactive tardigrades are so tough they can survive the harsh radiation and frigid vacuum of space travel.</p> <p>And so it came to be that there is life on the moon, probably. Lukasz Kaczmarek, a tardigrade expert and astrobiologist at the Adam Mickiewicz University in Pozna\u0144, said the animals may well have survived the crash landing. \u201cTardigrades can survive pressures that are comparable to those created when asteroids strike Earth, so a small crash like this is nothing to them,\u201d he said. The animals could potentially survive on the moon for years, he added.</p> <p>Dehydrated tardigrades have been revived after years in an inactive state by plunging them into water.

      "bodyText": "The odds of finding life on the moon have suddenly rocketed skywards. But rather than elusive alien moonlings, the beings in question came from Earth and were spilled across the landscape when a spacecraft crashed into the surface. The Israeli Beresheet probe was meant to be the first private lander to touch down on the moon. And all was going smoothly until mission controllers lost contact in April as the robotic craft made its way down. Beyond all the technology that was lost in the crash, Beresheet had an unusual cargo: a few thousand tiny tardigrades, the toughest animals on Earth. Now, the organisation behind the tardigrades\u2019 trip, the US-based Arch Mission Foundation \u2013 whose goal is to find a backup for Earth \u2013 has said the organisms may well have shrugged off the collision. \u201cOur payload may be the only surviving thing from that mission,\u201d Nova Spivack, the organisation\u2019s founder, told Wired magazine. Tardigrades have fascinated scientists since their discovery in the 18th century by the German zoologist and pastor Johann August Ephraim Goeze. The millimetre-long animals, sometimes known as water bears or moss piglets after their favoured environment and food, resemble cheerful eight-legged maggots wearing distinctly sphincter-like faces. But it is not their appearance that has made their name. Tardigrades are considered the hardiest animals on Earth. They have been found on mountain tops, in scorching deserts, and lurking in subglacial lakes in Antarctica. In his book The Hidden Powers of Animals, Dr Karl Shuker claimed the beasts survived being frozen in liquid helium and being boiled at 149C. The tardigrade\u2019s secret is the ability to shrivel into a seed-like pod, expelling nearly all of its water and slashing its metabolism. In this \u201ctun\u201d state, the animals can hunker down and survive conditions that would normally be swiftly fatal. In 2007, scientists discovered that inactive tardigrades are so tough they can survive the harsh radiation and frigid vacuum of space travel. And so it came to be that there is life on the moon, probably. Lukasz Kaczmarek, a tardigrade expert and astrobiologist at the Adam Mickiewicz University in Pozna\u0144, said the animals may well have survived the crash landing. \u201cTardigrades can survive pressures that are comparable to those created when asteroids strike Earth, so a small crash like this is nothing to them,\u201d he said. The animals could potentially survive on the moon for years, he added. Dehydrated tardigrades have been revived after years in an inactive state by plunging them into water. Once rehydrated, the animals become active again and feed and reproduce as normal. There is little chance of that happening to those that are lost in space, however. \u201cThey cannot colonise the moon because there is no atmosphere and no liquid water,\u201d Kaczmarek said. \u201cBut it could be possible to bring them back to Earth and then add the water. They should resurrect.\u201d Kaczmarek is exploring whether the ageing process itself grinds to a halt in dormant tardigrades, through what he calls a Sleeping Beauty model. He said it appears that a tardigrade that enters a tun state at one month old emerges with the same biological age when it is revived a decade later. \u201cIt is really amazing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt may be that we can use this in the future if we plan missions to different planets, because we will need to be young when we get there.\u201d Philippe Reekie, an astrobiologist and PhD student at the University of Edinburgh, agreed that there was no reason to think dehydrated tardigrades would not survive on the moon. \u201cI would imagine they would survive for some time,\u201d he said. \u201cThe main problem with the moon is the vacuum and the high radiation, but tardigrades are proven to survive those conditions.\u201d But he cautioned that if the tardigrades were in an active state on impact, they may well have met their end. \u201cIn their normal state, you can kill them quite easily,\u201d he said. \u201cWe accidentally killed loads by accident because we subjected them to the extreme cold too fast.\u201d Because the moon is considered lifeless, Nasa\u2019s office of planetary protection does not frown on missions that spill Earthly organisms on its surface.

Capitalism has failed oppressed people and capitalism has failed our planet. And I think more and more people are coming to that realization.\u201d</p> <p>Near the end of a long day of debate, cheers rang out in the conference room.

Polling suggest that young people are increasingly disillusioned by capitalism and more open to socialism than previous generations. At the same time, young people are more likely to associate socialism with the Scandinavian-style social welfare state than with Soviet communism. Though it was her first time attending a DSA conference since she joined a local Atlanta chapter, Kahn spoke passionately on several resolutions, particularly those she thought might affect candidates in the south. On a question about litmus tests, she said forcing southern candidates to identify as \u201cdemocratic socialists\u201d would be a \u201cdeath sentence\u201d. The resolution failed. \u201cPeople here are so institutionally primed to have a visceral, negative reaction to socialism,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we want to win here,\u201d she said afterward, \u201cthat might require molding ourselves to our environment a little bit and leading with our values instead.\u201d khalid kamau, a member of the city council in South Fulton, Georgia, and first #BlackLivesMatter organizer elected to public office, told the conference: \u201cWe have to understand that us fringe people are future thinkers.\u201d At a press conference later that weekend, he joined nearly two dozen locally elected democratic socialists, including from traditionally Republican areas. The slate included Ruth Buffalo, a Native American representative in North Dakota who ousted the sponsor of the state\u2019s ID law, Mik Pappas, a district judge in Pennsylvania who has sought to end cash bail in his court, and a contingent of the six democratic socialists recently elected to Chicago\u2019s 50-member city council. \u201cIt\u2019s a recognition that capitalism has failed us,\u201d Gabriel Acevero, who was elected to the Maryland state house of delegates in 2018, said of their growing ranks in elected office. \u201cCapitalism has failed working people. Capitalism has failed oppressed people and capitalism has failed our planet. And I think more and more people are coming to that realization.\u201d Near the end of a long day of debate, cheers rang out in the conference room. Sean Parker, a democratic socialist in Nashville, had just won a seat on the city council.",

Mackay took some convincing \u2013 Clough had to make several trips, always in his chairman\u2019s white Rolls-Royce in the hope of impressing the player \u2013 but eventually the player agreed to drop down a division and sign for the Rams.

But there are more similarities between Mackay and Rooney than is first apparent. Both were among the world\u2019s best in their position during their heyday.

Both are unassuming gentlemen of few words, though if you don\u2019t heed their point of view when they do speak, and they start breathing a little heavier through the nose, it\u2019s probably best to take a couple of steps back.

But the mention of Bowie will occasionally cause the 81-year-old\u2019s hoarse cockney drawl to soften and lighten up with enthusiasm.</p> <p>\u201cI treated David like a Shakespearean actor as you never knew who was going to show up,\u201d he says affectionately. \u201cHe could look alien-like or female-like; it was always so exciting as everything he did was so unpredictable.\u201d</p> <p>Over a 20-year period, O\u2019Neill captured Bowie\u2019s shapeshifting artistry better than just about anybody else, standing behind the camera as the Space Oddity singer transformed into theatrical glam avatar Ziggy Stardust, then morphed into the coke-addled Thin White Duke, who in 1976 <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/david-bowie-ground-control-to-davy-jones-77059/\">notoriously told Rolling Stone\u2019s Cameron Crowe</a>: \u201cI think I might have been a bloody good Hitler. I\u2019d be an excellent dictator.\u201d Although, O\u2019Neill claims: \u201cI don\u2019t actually remember him saying that stuff.\u201d</p> <p>His last magazine shoot with Bowie in 1992 was shot like a sentimental happy ending, with O\u2019Neill\u2019s warm closeups giving off the impression he was delighted the star had managed to make it out of the 1970s alive. \u201cIt felt like we had come full circle,\u201d he agrees.</p> <p>O\u2019Neill\u2019s photographs have left such a lasting impression because he was able to demystify some of the 20th century\u2019s biggest icons and cut to the core of their personalities. His photographs of Audrey Hepburn, for example, went beyond the clich\u00e9s of her delicate beauty and <a href=\"https://www.morrisonhotelgallery.com/photographs/jVICW7/Audrey-Hepburn\">prioritised her goofy side</a>, as she pulled silly faces while relaxing by the pool.</p> <p>The imperious strength of Winston Churchill, meanwhile, is something O\u2019Neill ripped into pieces. Instead, we saw <a href=\"https://www.morrisonhotelgallery.com/photographs/2xym9E/Winston-Churchill\">a frail old man</a> who was admirably trying to keep up the illusion of the cigar-munching British Bulldog despite the fact he had become so weak he had to be carried around in a chair by minders. \u201cIt was 1962 and I was going home from the office and saw this crowd forming,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI burst my way through it to take a photograph and it was Churchill leaving the hospital. I didn\u2019t really know his whole story so I just shot what was in front of me. The fact I didn\u2019t have any emotional baggage maybe helped.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2207ff34ba5adb0026dcd933081e4a7aeb17877b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2207ff34ba5adb0026dcd933081e4a7aeb17877b/0_0_5908_8961/659.jpg\" alt=\"Farewell Ziggy \u2026 Stardust\u2019s final outing, for an NBC late-night show in London, 1973.\" width=\"659\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Farewell Ziggy \u2026 Stardust\u2019s final outing, for an NBC late-night show in London, 1973.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Terry O\u2019Neill/Iconic Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Three years earlier, O\u2019Neill had started working at the Daily Sketch, becoming one of the youngest photographers on Fleet Street. \u201cI wanted to be just like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/aug/06/w-eugene-smith-photographer-record-everything\">W Eugene Smith</a>, who was such a great photojournalist. His images were full of truth.\u201d One of the first important gigs he can remember taking on was photographing <a href=\"http://www.artnet.com/artists/terry-oneill/laurence-olivier-in-drag-jMvEnL-KRPzG8yzvjxWJ-g2\">Laurence Olivier dressed as a woman</a> for a performance at the London variety show The Night of a Hundred Stars; perfect training for the gender fluidity of Bowie that would await him later on. \u201cThere was a 12-year-age gap between me and the next youngest photographer,\u201d he recalls.</p> <p>According to O\u2019Neill, nobody in Fleet Street wanted to interact with the youth scene and its emerging bands, such as the Beatles and the Rolling Stones. This left him with an opportunity to capture the swinging 60s with real freedom. \u201cI remember I was asked by an editor to go photograph this \u2018little band\u2019 called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/thebeatles\">the Beatles</a> at Abbey Road Studios, then that led to me working with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/therollingstones\">Stones</a>,\u201d says O\u2019Neill. \u201cAll the old timers didn\u2019t want to take these photographs on and almost looked down on them. It meant us youngsters could jump in and take up the opportunity. I could go out and create my own world. There was no other time like it; it was just so much fun!\u201d</p> <p>By the time O\u2019Neill started shooting Bowie during his Ziggy Stardust tour in 1973, he was much more of a respected name in the photography world. But while he had taken important concert photographs before, O\u2019Neill was able to enjoy these ones a lot more. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t bloody hear the Beatles,\u201d he explains, \u201cbut Bowie\u2019s show actually entertained you and had a story to it. I could hear every word and he really gave you a proper show.\u201d</p> <p>Scantily clad in fishnets and monster claws over his chest, rocking a garishly orange mullet, Bowie\u2019s on-stage \u201cbravery\u201d during this era impressed O\u2019Neill, especially the way he wasn\u2019t afraid to look effeminate at a time where this could get you beaten up. Most of all, he liked the fact that Bowie took charge of his own image during their sessions, particularly for their Diamond Dogs shoot, where the singer had a specific, animalistic, bare-chested pose in mind. He also brought a dog on to the set, which jumped up in shock at the flash of the strobe lighting, perfectly capturing the kind of avant garde chaos Bowie had intended for his dystopian album, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/may/19/david-bowie-nineteen-eighty-four-george-orwell-diamond-dogs-dorian-lynskey\">influenced by George Orwell\u2019s 1984</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"335f8a1cfce0ac9025febf69c5e00f8e9083166a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/335f8a1cfce0ac9025febf69c5e00f8e9083166a/0_0_6146_4338/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A contact sheet from the Diamond Dogs shoot.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"706\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A contact sheet from the Diamond Dogs shoot.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Terry O\u2019Neill/Iconic Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI loved that he had all these characters and took charge of our sessions and told me exactly what he wanted,\u201d says O\u2019Neill. \u201cIt meant that our pictures had a purpose.

      "bodyText": "From Audrey Hepburn to the Beatles, Frank Sinatra and Elton John, there aren\u2019t many pop cultural icons Terry O\u2019Neill hasn\u2019t photographed. One of his subjects, Hollywood actress Faye Dunaway \u2013 who he famously captured hungover, surrounded by newspapers the morning after winning an Oscar in 1977 \u2013 became his wife, even if the memory now frustrates him. He agrees that a photographer falling in love with one of their subjects is rarely a good idea: \u201cThat was a waste of 12 years of my life!\u201d Yet the legendary photographer insists none of these stars compared to David Bowie. \u201cHe was my creative muse,\u201d O\u2019Neill tells me authoritatively over the phone. \u201cHe was so charming and warm, and one of the few people [other than Faye] I really felt friendly towards.\u201d Currently suffering from prostate cancer, O\u2019Neill is confined to bed and admits that he\u2019s severely lacking in energy. But the mention of Bowie will occasionally cause the 81-year-old\u2019s hoarse cockney drawl to soften and lighten up with enthusiasm. \u201cI treated David like a Shakespearean actor as you never knew who was going to show up,\u201d he says affectionately. \u201cHe could look alien-like or female-like; it was always so exciting as everything he did was so unpredictable.\u201d Over a 20-year period, O\u2019Neill captured Bowie\u2019s shapeshifting artistry better than just about anybody else, standing behind the camera as the Space Oddity singer transformed into theatrical glam avatar Ziggy Stardust, then morphed into the coke-addled Thin White Duke, who in 1976 notoriously told Rolling Stone\u2019s Cameron Crowe: \u201cI think I might have been a bloody good Hitler. I\u2019d be an excellent dictator.\u201d Although, O\u2019Neill claims: \u201cI don\u2019t actually remember him saying that stuff.\u201d His last magazine shoot with Bowie in 1992 was shot like a sentimental happy ending, with O\u2019Neill\u2019s warm closeups giving off the impression he was delighted the star had managed to make it out of the 1970s alive. \u201cIt felt like we had come full circle,\u201d he agrees.

His photographs of Audrey Hepburn, for example, went beyond the clich\u00e9s of her delicate beauty and prioritised her goofy side, as she pulled silly faces while relaxing by the pool. The imperious strength of Winston Churchill, meanwhile, is something O\u2019Neill ripped into pieces. Instead, we saw a frail old man who was admirably trying to keep up the illusion of the cigar-munching British Bulldog despite the fact he had become so weak he had to be carried around in a chair by minders. \u201cIt was 1962 and I was going home from the office and saw this crowd forming,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI burst my way through it to take a photograph and it was Churchill leaving the hospital. I didn\u2019t really know his whole story so I just shot what was in front of me.

Multi-level classes, where teachers taught Higher and National grades in the same class, were now the norm.</p> <p>\u201cSwinney is trying to pretend this is just a statistical blip,\u201d Gray said. \u201cIt isn\u2019t.

      "bodyText": "Scottish ministers have been accused of failing to invest enough in education after pass rates in nearly all school qualifications fell for the fourth year in a row. The Scottish Qualifications Authority said A-C passes in Higher grades, roughly equivalent to an A level, fell to below 75%, after four consecutive years of decline, while Advanced Higher grades also fell to their lowest pass rate since 2015. The figures showed a slight increase of 0.7% in passes year on year for National 5s, the equivalent of an O level in England and Wales, but in National 4s, an award for students not academically suited to National 5s, they fell by 1.1%. John Swinney, the Scottish education secretary and deputy first minister, said fluctuations in results were acceptable. \u201cThese are a strong set of results which show a degree of year on year variation expected in a high-performing education system with credible assessment,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the pass rate only ever went up people would rightly question the robustness of our assessment system.\u201d That was angrily dismissed by Scottish Labour and the Scottish Conservatives, who said there was now an established trend of declining results in schools, due entirely to cuts in teacher numbers, budgets and in subject choice. Iain Gray, Labour\u2019s education spokesman, said core teaching numbers were 3,000 lower than when the Scottish National party came to power in 2007, increasing the strain on teachers and schools. Multi-level classes, where teachers taught Higher and National grades in the same class, were now the norm. \u201cSwinney is trying to pretend this is just a statistical blip,\u201d Gray said. \u201cIt isn\u2019t. It\u2019s a trend. He is really clutching at straws this year. \u201cWhat he\u2019s desperately trying to avoid admitting what we\u2019ve seen over the last four years is a fall in attainment with Highers \u2013 the gold standard of Scottish education.\u201d Compared with 2013, the year before substantial changes in teaching and exams came into force under Curriculum for Excellence (CfE) reforms, the number of entries for exams and awards have fallen by nearly 17%. Total entries for all awards, including Skills for Work employability courses, fell from 670,568 in 2015 (when CfE was fully in place) to 636,085 this year.

Paul himself called the paper \u201cnon-party-political\u201d, a term that allows for two distinct meanings: not political, belonging to no party; and political but not in the way that parties are.</p> <p>This movable perspective was especially valuable at a time when weekly journals had a much larger effect than they do now. Voices were strong and clear, had not yet faded into abstraction or returned only to confess.</p> <p>Writers in New Society did not have to agree, but just show up on the same page. You could read <a href=\"http://people.duke.edu/~dainotto/Texts/barth.pdf\" title=\"\">John Barth on the literature of exhaustion</a>, Angela Carter on Japan, Reyner Banham on new Cambridge architecture, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jan/02/john-berger-obituary\" title=\"\">John Berger </a>on the Bauhaus or Magritte, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/may/18/guardianobituaries.obituaries\" title=\"\">Mary Douglas</a> on ritual, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jan/17/eric-hobsbawm-mi5-communism-stalin-historian-private-papers\" title=\"\">Eric Hobsbaw</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jan/17/eric-hobsbawm-mi5-communism-stalin-historian-private-papers\" title=\"\">m</a> on violence, RD Laing on Wilhelm Reich, Edmund Leach on structuralism, Dennis Potter on Orwell, Mary Warnock on Freud, Raymond Williams on dissent, DW Winnicott on children, and many other remarkable thinkers on many topics.</p> <p>It was no accident that Paul remained such a good friend of people whose politics were far from his own, since his professional policy as an editor struck exactly the same note. He did not intervene and rewrite a lot, but he knew just who to ask to write on which topic, and something of his own cool combination of scepticism and curiosity affected the writers he worked with. They were clearer than they were elsewhere, and a little more patient with their enemies.</p> <p>Born in Hebden Bridge, West Yorkshire, Paul was the son of Marion (nee Ashworth) and Donald Barker, who ran a fish and chip shop and was also a newsagent. He studied at Hebden Bridge grammar school and Calder high school. He learned Russian while doing national service in the Intelligence Corps (1953-55), and studied French at Brasenose College, Oxford (1955-58). He spent a year as lecteur at the \u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure in Paris, joined the Times in 1959 and the Economist in 1964, before moving on to New Society.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2f0bd71670d20de6812eb7734c92b3fa248952a8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f0bd71670d20de6812eb7734c92b3fa248952a8/0_113_2704_3741/723.jpg\" alt=\"An edition of New Society from 1965.\" width=\"723\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An edition of New Society from 1965.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Sillitoe/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When he started his career as a journalist, Paul was told that he needed to spend five years or so in the provinces before moving to London. He said he had already spent 18 years there, and took a job at the Times. In his book Hebden Bridge: A Sense of Belonging (2012) Paul recalls giving his Yorkshire bank manager this piece of good news. The manager responded: \u201cOh, that\u2019s nice. I look forward seeing you around the village.\u201d He was thinking of the Hebden Bridge Times.</p> <p>In moving to London, Paul was not rejecting the provinces: though he did not want to work there, he maintained an admirable double allegiance. He became the perfect Londoner, knew the city inside out, loved to talk about its old churches, interesting pubs, offbeat restaurants and lurking legends. But he also never lost track of the values, loyalties and habits of thought of Hebden Bridge. He was thus extraordinarily open to any sort of idea or project that made sense to him.</p> <p>He resigned from the magazine in 1986, two years before it was merged with the New Statesman. Paul\u2019s subsequent career involved editorial positions at the Sunday Telegraph and the Independent, and the writing of regular columns for the Evening Standard and the New Statesman. His book The Freedoms of Suburbia (2009), was followed by Hebden Bridge and by two detective novels, A Crooked Smile (2013) and The Dead Don\u2019t Die (2014).</p> <p>Friends think of long conversations when they think of Paul. Of arguments too, although always pursued for the pleasure of arguing rather than for the sake of being right. He was interested in many things \u2013 jazz, film, theatre, politics, literature, history, architecture, urban planning \u2013 and his idea of an interest was actually to know something about the given subject. His smile often said even more than his words. It was invariably welcoming, but showed a flicker of irony, indicating mildly that he thought the world was at it again, behaving in its predictably ridiculous way. </p> <p>In 1960 he married Sally Huddleston. She survives him, along with his daughter, Kate, his sons, Nicholas, Tom and Daniel, and his four grandchildren.</p> <p>\u2022 Paul Barker, writer and editor, born 24 August 1935; died 20 July 2019</p>",

Laurie Taylor, a regular contributor, said that \u201canarchists and socialists and conservatives were all made to feel at home in a magazine that ... had become part of the social conversation of the nation\u201d. Paul himself called the paper \u201cnon-party-political\u201d, a term that allows for two distinct meanings: not political, belonging to no party; and political but not in the way that parties are. This movable perspective was especially valuable at a time when weekly journals had a much larger effect than they do now. Voices were strong and clear, had not yet faded into abstraction or returned only to confess. Writers in New Society did not have to agree, but just show up on the same page. You could read John Barth on the literature of exhaustion, Angela Carter on Japan, Reyner Banham on new Cambridge architecture, John Berger on the Bauhaus or Magritte, Mary Douglas on ritual, Eric Hobsbawm on violence, RD Laing on Wilhelm Reich, Edmund Leach on structuralism, Dennis Potter on Orwell, Mary Warnock on Freud, Raymond Williams on dissent, DW Winnicott on children, and many other remarkable thinkers on many topics. It was no accident that Paul remained such a good friend of people whose politics were far from his own, since his professional policy as an editor struck exactly the same note. He did not intervene and rewrite a lot, but he knew just who to ask to write on which topic, and something of his own cool combination of scepticism and curiosity affected the writers he worked with. They were clearer than they were elsewhere, and a little more patient with their enemies. Born in Hebden Bridge, West Yorkshire, Paul was the son of Marion (nee Ashworth) and Donald Barker, who ran a fish and chip shop and was also a newsagent. He studied at Hebden Bridge grammar school and Calder high school. He learned Russian while doing national service in the Intelligence Corps (1953-55), and studied French at Brasenose College, Oxford (1955-58). He spent a year as lecteur at the \u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure in Paris, joined the Times in 1959 and the Economist in 1964, before moving on to New Society. When he started his career as a journalist, Paul was told that he needed to spend five years or so in the provinces before moving to London. He said he had already spent 18 years there, and took a job at the Times. In his book Hebden Bridge: A Sense of Belonging (2012) Paul recalls giving his Yorkshire bank manager this piece of good news. The manager responded: \u201cOh, that\u2019s nice. I look forward seeing you around the village.\u201d He was thinking of the Hebden Bridge Times. In moving to London, Paul was not rejecting the provinces: though he did not want to work there, he maintained an admirable double allegiance. He became the perfect Londoner, knew the city inside out, loved to talk about its old churches, interesting pubs, offbeat restaurants and lurking legends. But he also never lost track of the values, loyalties and habits of thought of Hebden Bridge. He was thus extraordinarily open to any sort of idea or project that made sense to him. He resigned from the magazine in 1986, two years before it was merged with the New Statesman. Paul\u2019s subsequent career involved editorial positions at the Sunday Telegraph and the Independent, and the writing of regular columns for the Evening Standard and the New Statesman. His book The Freedoms of Suburbia (2009), was followed by Hebden Bridge and by two detective novels, A Crooked Smile (2013) and The Dead Don\u2019t Die (2014). Friends think of long conversations when they think of Paul. Of arguments too, although always pursued for the pleasure of arguing rather than for the sake of being right. He was interested in many things \u2013 jazz, film, theatre, politics, literature, history, architecture, urban planning \u2013 and his idea of an interest was actually to know something about the given subject. His smile often said even more than his words. It was invariably welcoming, but showed a flicker of irony, indicating mildly that he thought the world was at it again, behaving in its predictably ridiculous way. In 1960 he married Sally Huddleston. She survives him, along with his daughter, Kate, his sons, Nicholas, Tom and Daniel, and his four grandchildren. \u2022 Paul Barker, writer and editor, born 24 August 1935; died 20 July 2019",

China fixed the yuan both below the 7 level and about 300 pips less than economists\u2019 expectations. The PBOC\u2019s stronger-than-expected fixing comes after the US labeled the country as a currency manipulator.</p> <p>China\u2019s currency decision is probably more of a move to deliver some stability following Monday\u2019s collapse and not a reaction to any action or rhetoric from the US. Since tariffs have come into play, China has been steadily lowering the yuan to offset the tariffs. If they lower the yuan another 3%, that would pretty much cover the whole 25% tariff on the $300 billion of Chinese goods.</p> <p>The formal designation of being a currency manipulator allows the US to deliver sanctions on China and for the Treasury Department to try to convince the IMF on doing something about the China\u2019s unfair competitive advantage. FX markets are not expecting any immediate impact on the formal designation as the yuan\u2019s move was a depreciation and not a devaluation. The ball is now in China\u2019s court and we could see them try to make life harder for US businesses. It is growing unlikely that we will see any breakthroughs this month and that will remain a difficult an environment to be bullish with equities. </p> <p>Over the next couple of weeks, we will see the US try to deliver rhetoric that will weaken the greenback. The US might seek a Plaza Accord agreement that will look for other nations support in devaluing the dollar. In the 80s, the G5 (US, UK, Germany, Japan, and France) agreed to lower the dollar to help deal with trade imbalances. In today\u2019s world of economic weakness, a Plaza Accord agreement would likely get not any support outside of the US. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d4981188f084f687f351b07\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-06T13:34:04.211Z\">2.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Wall Street opens higher</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Wall Street has risen after the opening bell.</p> <ul> <li>Dow Jones up 139 points, or 0.54%, at 25,856</li> <li>S&amp;P 500 up 17 points, or 0.62%, at 2,862</li> <li>Nasdaq up 76 points, or 0.98%, at 7,802</li> </ul> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-08-06T13:35:00.619Z\">at 2.35pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d4977318f08c7e177d45a46\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-06T12:51:34.051Z\">1.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Here in the UK, the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) has become the first business group to call for an emergency budget before the 31 October Brexit deadline, <em>PA repor</em>ts.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Businesses should receive \u201cBrexit vouchers\u201d as part of an emergency budget to help them cope with a potential no-deal exit from the EU, the Treasury has been told.</p> <p>The Federation of Small Businesses urged the chancellor, Sajid Javid, to produce an emergency budget to support businesses after Brexit.</p> <p>Speaking to PA, FSB policy and advocacy chairman Martin McTague said the UK needs to \u201cget serious\u201d about planning and preparing the economy.</p> <p>The FSB is calling for an emergency budget including a \u201cblanket cut\u201d to employer national insurance contributions.

      "bodyText": "European and US stocks have staged a recovery after two days of heavy selling, as the US-China trade war intensified. The People\u2019s Bank of China hit back at the White House today, saying its labelling of Beijing as a currency manipulator would \u201cseverely damage international financial order and cause chaos in financial markets\u201d. It strongly denied it was using the Chinese currency as a weapon in the trade war with the US, saying it \u201chas not used and will not use the exchange rate as a tool to deal with trade disputes\u201d. At the same time, the Chinese central bank acted to prop up the yuan, setting a stronger-than-expected mid point of 6.9683 per dollar, and sought to reassure foreign firms over the currency\u2019s decline. The Chinese currency steadied, after yesterday\u2019s sharp drop below the seven-to-one-dollar mark for the first time since May 2008. The onshore yuan, which can trade 2% to either side of a daily mid-point set by China\u2019s central bank, rose slightly but remained near 11-year lows. The US Treasury Department said last night that it had determined for the first time since 1994 that China was manipulating its currency. Goldman Sachs no longer expects the US and China to strike a trade deal to end their prolonged dispute before the November 2020 presidential election. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones has gained more than 200 points to 25,918.58, a 0.78% increase after suffering its worst trading day this year yesterday. The Nasdaq is 1.3% ahead and the S&amp;P 500 has added 1.01%. Germany\u2019s Dax is 0.44% ahead at 11,709.54, France\u2019s CAC has risen 0.9% to 5,288.58, Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB is up 0.5% at 20,880.31 and Spain\u2019s Ibex has edged 0.14% higher to 8,789.10. The FTSE 100 index in London, however, is trading 0.29% lower at 7,201.87, a loss of 21 points, after experiencing its worst day so far this year yesterday. The pound has recovered after hitting two-year lows last week. It is 0.32% higher on the day against the dollar at $1.2183 and has gained 0.54% versus the euro, to \u20ac1.0904. Thank you for all your comments. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Edward Moya, senior market analyst at trading platform Oanda in New York, says: Markets are relieved with the PBOC\u2019s decision to weaken the yuan at a slower pace, a sign that we might not just yet see the peak escalation in the US-China trade war. China fixed the yuan both below the 7 level and about 300 pips less than economists\u2019 expectations. The PBOC\u2019s stronger-than-expected fixing comes after the US labeled the country as a currency manipulator. China\u2019s currency decision is probably more of a move to deliver some stability following Monday\u2019s collapse and not a reaction to any action or rhetoric from the US. Since tariffs have come into play, China has been steadily lowering the yuan to offset the tariffs. If they lower the yuan another 3%, that would pretty much cover the whole 25% tariff on the $300 billion of Chinese goods. The formal designation of being a currency manipulator allows the US to deliver sanctions on China and for the Treasury Department to try to convince the IMF on doing something about the China\u2019s unfair competitive advantage. FX markets are not expecting any immediate impact on the formal designation as the yuan\u2019s move was a depreciation and not a devaluation. The ball is now in China\u2019s court and we could see them try to make life harder for US businesses. It is growing unlikely that we will see any breakthroughs this month and that will remain a difficult an environment to be bullish with equities. Over the next couple of weeks, we will see the US try to deliver rhetoric that will weaken the greenback. The US might seek a Plaza Accord agreement that will look for other nations support in devaluing the dollar. In the 80s, the G5 (US, UK, Germany, Japan, and France) agreed to lower the dollar to help deal with trade imbalances. In today\u2019s world of economic weakness, a Plaza Accord agreement would likely get not any support outside of the US. Wall Street has risen after the opening bell. Dow Jones up 139 points, or 0.54%, at 25,856 S&amp;P 500 up 17 points, or 0.62%, at 2,862 Nasdaq up 76 points, or 0.98%, at 7,802 Here in the UK, the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) has become the first business group to call for an emergency budget before the 31 October Brexit deadline, PA reports. Businesses should receive \u201cBrexit vouchers\u201d as part of an emergency budget to help them cope with a potential no-deal exit from the EU, the Treasury has been told. The Federation of Small Businesses urged the chancellor, Sajid Javid, to produce an emergency budget to support businesses after Brexit. Speaking to PA, FSB policy and advocacy chairman Martin McTague said the UK needs to \u201cget serious\u201d about planning and preparing the economy. The FSB is calling for an emergency budget including a \u201cblanket cut\u201d to employer national insurance contributions. They say a reduction from 13.8% to 12% would help small employers manage a surge in staffing costs. The group also recommends an uprating of the \u00a33,000 employment allowance following a decision to target the relief at the small firms that need it most. Other recommendations include reducing the 17.5% VAT rate. For small businesses that could be affected by the prospect of a no-deal Brexit, such as those that trade exclusively with one European market, the FSB is calling for \u201cBrexit vouchers\u201d worth up to \u00a33,000 to assist with planning for the future, accessing new markets, retraining staff and retooling. McTague said: \u201cWith the UK set to leave the EU on 31 October, we need an emergency budget before Brexit happens. It\u2019s time for this government to get serious about planning and preparing the economy. \u201cAdvertising campaigns and small-scale measures focused on a few exporters won\u2019t cut it. Cash is king for small firms, so we urgently need measures that will allow them to shore up balance sheets, keep hiring, and help them prepare for an uncertain future.\u201d Japan\u2019s yen, seen as a safe haven in times of market turmoil, touched a seven-month high of 105.52 per dollar today before dropping back to 106.40 in volatile trade. The Swiss franc, another safe-haven asset, has risen about 1% against the dollar this week. Spot gold, another beneficiary of the flight to safety, hit a six-year peak of $1.474.80 an ounce, but has retreated slightly to $1.466.88, still up 0.2%. Oil prices have steadied, after earlier declines to a seven-month low of $59.07 a barrel for Brent crude, the global benchmark. It is at $60.11 at the moment, up 0.5%. Senior People\u2019s Bank of China officials have reassured foreign companies that the currency won\u2019t continue to weaken significantly, a day after the yuan fell below 7 per dollar for the first time since 2008, Bloomberg reports. The central bank held a meeting with a number of foreign exporters in Beijing today, at which officials also said that companies\u2019 ability to buy and sell dollars would remain normal, according to a statement provided to Bloomberg. The yuan gained in offshore trading following the news, reaching 7.0428 per dollar, its strongest level today. Yesterday, China let the yuan fall in onshore trading below the 7 per dollar level it had defended for years. However, today the PBOC set its daily reference rate at 6.9683 per dollar, stronger than expected. China\u2019s central bank has put out a statement, saying that Washington\u2019s labelling of Beijing as a currency manipulator would \u201cseverely damage international financial order and cause chaos in financial markets\u201d. In the country\u2019s first official response, the People\u2019s Bank of China also said that Washington\u2019s move would \u201cprevent a global economic and trade recovery\u201d. It was emphatic that it was not using its currency as a weapon in the prolonged trade war. It said China has not used and will not use the exchange rate as a tool to deal with trade disputes. The US Treasury Department said last night that it had determined for the first time since 1994 that China was manipulating its currency. The Chinese currency has steadied somewhat, after yesterday\u2019s sharp drop which drew Washington\u2019s ire. The onshore yuan, which can trade 2% to either side of a daily mid-point set by China\u2019s central bank, rose 0.2% but remained near 11-year lows beyond the symbolic seven-to-one-dollar mark, at 7.0321 per dollar. The PBOC set a slightly stronger-than-expected mid point today. European investors have been cheered by news earlier this morning that factory orders in Germany, the eurozone\u2019s largest economy, rose 2.5% in June, the biggest jump since August 2017 (although the government warned that manufacturing is yet to reach a turning point following months of weakness). The data calmed nerves, after China ramped up its rhetoric in its trade war with the US \u2013 although it acted to prop up the yuan. Thomas Glitzel, an economist at VP Bank, was cautious. He told Reuters: The decent increase [in German orders] in June is good news, but is no cause for immediate celebration. In view of the trade conflicts, humility is required. The export-reliant German economy has been battered by trade disputes, cooling global demand and Brexit uncertainty, and is expected to have shrunk in the second quarter. While the pound is enjoying some respite after last week\u2019s sell-off, Domino\u2019s Pizza is fretting about a no-deal Brexit. It said the probability of the UK crashing out of the EU without an agreement at the end of October had increased. This has prompted the pizza chain to spend \u00a37m on stockpiling ingredients, including tomato sauce for its pizzas, in case a no-deal Brexit messes up food supplies. My colleague Jasper Jolly writes: While Domino\u2019s buys its flour and cheese in the UK, it imports the tomato sauce for its pizza bases from Portugal. Other imported ingredients added to the stockpile include frozen chicken and all long-life ambient products, such as tuna and pineapple. British importers of perishable food are particularly exposed to the threat of a no-deal Brexit, which most trade experts believe would cause delays at the border and increase the possibility of higher prices. Boris Johnson\u2019s government has committed to leaving the EU on 31 October with or without a deal. China has hit back at Washington today after being branded a currency manipulator, accusing the US of \u201cdestroying the international order\u201d. The escalation of the trade war between the two sides, which threatens to become a full-blown currency war, drove Asian shares sharply lower. However, European shares have bounced back after the sell-off of the last two days, after China propped up the yuan, and the release of unexpectedly strong German factory orders and a decent eurozone construction survey. The pound has also recovered after hitting two-year lows last week and is up 0.44% against the dollar at $1.2199, and up 0.46% against the euro at \u20ac1.0894. UK\u2019s FTSE 100 up 8 points at 7,231, a 0.11% gain Germany\u2019s Dax up 0.72% at 11,742 France\u2019s CAC 40 up 1% at 5,295 Spain\u2019s Ibex up 0.4% at 8,812 Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB up 0.29% at 20,832 UBS, the world\u2019s largest wealth manager, plans to charge its wealthy individual clients 0.6% for holding more than \u20ac500,000 in cash \u2013 i.e. it will penalise them for being risk averse. Back to the markets. The pound has stabilised after hitting a two-and-half-year low against the dollar last week and a two-year low against the euro. Today, it has risen 0.43% against the dollar to $1.2198 and 0.48% against the euro to \u20ac1.0896. Despite the latest moves, the online bookmaker Betway has cut the odds of the euro being valued higher by the end of this year from 11/4 to 5/2. The bookmaker has never rated it more likely for the pound to fall below parity with the continent\u2019s single currency, and offers those who believe in the \u201cmighty pound\u201d odds of 2/7 that it remains at a higher value for the remainder of the year. Betway\u2019s Alan Alger said: At 5/2, just short of a 30% probability, there looks to be a real chance of the euro ending 2019 with a higher value than sterling. We had offered 11/4 for sterling to dip below the single currency for some weeks, but that price looked too big given the sustained weakness and now anybody wishing to throw their weight behind the pound is welcome to take 2/7 on it remaining stronger. In New York, the Barneys department store chain has filed for bankruptcy protection, which means most of its stores will close \u2013 but a $75m financing package is designed to give the retailer time to find a buyer. Barneys New York, which opened its 10-storey Madison Avenue store in 1993, became a cultural icon in luxury shopping but has been hit by high rents and a shift towards online shopping. The company, which runs 13 department stores and nine warehouse stores, will shut down shops in Chicago, Las Vegas and Seattle, but will keep seven stores including its flagship Manhattan shop. Barneys chief executive Daniella Vitale said Barneys had been hurt by the downturn in retail as well as \u201cexcessively high\u201d rents. She said bankruptcy protection will provide the company the necessary tools to conduct a sale process, review our current leases and optimise our operations. The FTSE 100 has slipped into the red again, trading some 6 points lower at 7,217, after suffering its worst day this year yesterday when it slumped 2.47%. It is the sixth day of declines for Britain\u2019s blue-chip index. To recap: China stepped up the trade war rhetoric today, accusing the US of \u201cdeliberately destroying international order\u201d with \u201cunilateralism and protectionism\u201d. A day after Washington branded China a currency manipulator in a rapidly escalating trade dispute, China\u2019s central bank said it \u201cdeeply regretted\u201d the move by the US and said such behaviour \u201cseriously undermined international rules\u201d and damaged the global economy. In a strongly worded editorial in the People\u2019s Daily, the official newspaper of the Chinese Communist party, China accused the US of \u201cdeliberately destroying the international order\u201d and holding its own citizens hostage. Without mentioning Donald Trump or Washington\u2019s accusations of currency manipulation, it said: Today some in America are obsessed with American privilege to the point of destroying international rules and the international system \u2026 These Americans need to wake up!\u201d The responsibility of big countries is to provide the world with stability and certainty while creating conditions and opportunities for the common development of all countries. Gold has hit a fresh six-year high, rising above $1,473 this morning, after Beijing hit back at Washington\u2019s branding of the country as a currency manipulator. Asian stock markets were painted red overnight but shares in Europe have stabilised, no doubt helped by the strong factory orders data from Germany this morning. Germany\u2019s Dax has risen 0.46%, France\u2019s CAC is up 0.67%, Spain\u2019s Ibex has edged 0.09% higher and Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB is 0.25% ahead. The FTSE 100 index has just ventured into positive territory, trading 7 points higher at 7231, a 0.1% gain. UBS, the Swiss investment bank, has sent us its analysis of the impact of the 10% tariff on $300bn of US imports from China threatened by Donald Trump last Friday. The direct impact of the new tariffs, if implemented, would reduce US GDP by 0.15%, and we estimate Chinese GDP growth in the next 12 months could fall by 0.25\u20130.5 percentage points as a result, which would push the country\u2019s growth rate below 6% into 2020. Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, says: China\u2019s response to recent trade escalations has been relatively measured and we expect a similar reaction this time, with retaliation involving a mix of more tariffs and non-tariff measures. Potential non-tariff measures include a managed depreciation of the yuan to mitigate the trade impact from higher tariffs, penalising select US companies operating in China, and imposing export restrictions on rare earth metals. He warned investors not to overreact. There is still time to find a compromise, trade talks between the US and China scheduled for September have not been called off, and investors should also consider potential offsetting factors such as rate cuts by central banks and stimulus in China. Our base case assumes a long, drawn-out negotiation process, during which tensions can occasionally flare up. An environment of a) rising trade tensions and b) potential stimulus, including falling interest rates, is tricky for investors to navigate. While we ultimately believe that US\u2013China tradetensions will be resolved through negotiations, we think equities may struggle to move markedly higher until there is greater certainty. Goldman Sachs no longer expects the United States and China to strike a trade deal to end their prolonged dispute before the November 2020 presidential election. The US investment bank also now expects two more back-to-back interest rate cuts from the US Federal Reserve, in September and October, \u201cin light of growing trade policy risks, market expectations for much deeper rate cuts, and an increase in global risk related to the possibility of a no-deal Brexit\u201d. The Fed cut rates last week for the first time in more than a decade. Goldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius says: The Fed has been increasingly responsive this year to trade war threats, bond market expectations, and global growth concerns. In a tweet yesterday, Donald Trump urged the Fed to take note of the yuan\u2019s sharp drop against the dollar \u2013 piling pressure on the central bank to cut rates again. Here is our full story on the Boohoo move for Karen Millen and Coast, which is putting 1,100 jobs at risk, by Guardian reporter Jasper Jolly. Eliot Kerr, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey, said: Growth remained subdued in the eurozone construction sector during July, as activity declines in Germany and Italy acted to drag on an expansion in France. New construction orders across the currency area were broadly stagnant for the second month in succession, dampened by a sharp reduction in Germany. At the sub-sector level, the only substantially positive contribution came from commercial project activity. That said, the latest increase for the category was only marginal overall and the slowest for four months. New orders in the eurozone\u2019s construction sector remained unchanged for the second month in a row, but firms reported solid increases in employment and purchasing activity. Construction in the eurozone expanded at a slightly faster rate last month, according to the latest IHS Markit purchasing managers\u2019 index. Its headline reading rose to 50.8 in July from 50.6 in June. It recorded modest expansion in France and small declines in Germany and Italy. The online fashion retailer Boohoo has made an offer to buy the online businesses and brands of Karen Millen and Coast, in a move that will raise fears for the jobs of hundreds of employees in the brands\u2019 high street stores. Karen Millen and Coast together employ about 1,100 people with 32 stores and 177 concessions in the UK. This could be yet more bad news for retail workers, after Tesco slashed 4,500 jobs at 153 Tesco Metro supermarkets in the UK yesterday, while the banking giant HSBC announced up to 4,700 job cuts around the world. European stock markets have stabilised after the rout in recent days, and are trading slightly higher this morning. The Dax in Frankfurt has gained 0.35% while the CAC 40 in Paris is 0.19% ahead. In London, the FTSE 100 is down 0.49%, however, falling to 7,190. Sterling has firmed slightly against the dollar and the euro, by 0.27%, to $1.2175 and \u20ac1.0871 respectively. British retailers have recorded the worst month for sales in July since records began, as consumers tighten their belts with Brexit approaching, the industry body has reported. According to British Retail Consortium sales data compiled by the accountancy firm KPMG, total sales increased by 0.3% in July, compared with a rise of 1.6% in July last year, writes our economics correspondent Richard Partington. With the British economy facing growing uncertainty, the industry lobby group said the rise was the weakest since its records began in 1995. Helen Dickinson, the chief executive of the BRC, said low real-wage growth for UK households and Brexit had left consumer spending languishing. The average growth in sales over the past 12 months was 0.5%, the weakest expansion on record. Whereas last year\u2019s glorious sunshine and World Cup finals led to strong consumer demand over the summer, this year has been weak in comparison. And we are off \u2013 European stock markets are mixed in early trading. UK\u2019s FTSE 100 down 21 points, or 0.29%, at 7,202 Germany\u2019s Dax up 0.3% France\u2019s CAC down 0.1% Spain\u2019s Ibex up 0.1% Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB up 0.16% Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Chinese state media have said that the United States was \u201cdeliberately destroying international order,\u201d a day after Washington branded Beijing a currency manipulator in an escalating trade war. Donald Trump tweeted the accusation after a sharp drop in the yuan beyond the seven-to-one-dollar rate for the first time since 2008. The US Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, then also accused China of manipulating its currency \u201cto gain unfair competitive advantage in international trade\u201d. The US will now ask the International Monetary Fund to \u201celiminate the unfair competitive advantage created by China\u2019s latest actions\u201d. China\u2019s official Communist Party newspaper, the People\u2019s Daily, said in an editorial that the US was holding its own citizens to ransom, Reuters reported. The responsibility of big countries is to provide the world with stability and certainty while creating conditions and opportunities for the common development of all countries, according to the editorial. \u201cBut some people in the United States do just the opposite,\u201d it said. After losing more than 2% in recent days, since Trump threatened fresh 10% tariffs on $300bn of Chinese imports from 1 September on Friday, the yuan has steadied. Today, the People\u2019s Bank of China set set the yuan fixing at 6.9683, stronger than expected. However, Asian stock markets are a sea of red again as traders worry about the impact of the trade tensions on the global economy. The escalation has caused a major sell-off on world markets in recent days. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones and the S&amp;P 500 indices both closed nearly 3% lower yesterday while in the London, the FTSE 100 index tumbled 2.47%. The Dow suffered its worst trading day this year. Japan\u2019s Nikkei down 0.65% at 20,585 Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng down 1.14% at 25,853 China\u2019s CSI 300 down 1.22% at 3,630 South Korea\u2019s Kospi down 1.17% at 25,845 Singapore\u2019s Straits Times down 0.81% at 3,168 European shares are also expected to open lower. The economic calendar looks pretty bare today. We\u2019ve had German factory orders for June this morning, which were surprisingly strong. They rose 2.5% from the previous month, bringing some respite after Germany\u2019s recent manufacturing slump. However, the figures tend to be volatile. The Australian central bank held interest rates at an all-time low of 1% and its governor Philip Lowe said it was \u201creasonable to expect that an extended period of low interest rates will be required in Australia\u201d, to boost employment growth and inflation. He will appear before a parliamentary committee on Friday and is likely to be asked about the impact of the US-China trade war. The Agenda 8:30am BST: Markit Eurozone Construction PMI (July)",

      "bodyText": "It is about now in a Rugby World Cup cycle, with just over 40 days and nights in the phoney war wilderness still to endure, that the truth starts to emerge. There is only so much iron you can pump in a gym: if anyone hoping to lift the Webb Ellis Cup is not fit by now they never will be. You cannot fake it at a World Cup and expect to have a realistic chance. With a slew of warm-up Tests shortly commencing for all the European nations, nevertheless, those seeking clues about the prospects of Wales, England, Scotland, Ireland, France, Italy and others should not focus purely on August\u2019s results. Four years ago, for example, England saw off France and Ireland at Twickenham before hosting the 2015 tournament and still exited in the pool stages. Scotland, conversely, lost against the French and Irish yet came within a midge\u2019s whisker of the semi-finals. Warm-up scorelines can also be warped by variables: coaches protecting their star men, conditioning experts trying to ensure everyone peaks in October and early November rather than August.

Construction is under way of the world\u2019s tallest towers built using modular manufacturing, a method by which houses or blocks of flats are built in sections offsite in a factory.

So we will see it becoming less niche and more mainstream,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Modular construction, which is popular in countries such as Japan, Germany and Sweden, has been slower to take off in the UK. Of the 200,000 homes built each year in the UK, about 15,000 are modular, according to <a href=\"http://constructingexcellence.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/graham-robinson-pinsent-masons-14022017.pdf\">a report</a> by law firm Pinsent Masons.

This year, Japan\u2019s biggest house builder, Sekisui, entered a venture with the UK government expected to result in thousands of modular homes across the country. Ikea has been given the go-ahead by Worthing council to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jun/26/uk-council-ikea-affordable-housing-worthing-boklok\">build affordable modular homes</a> on the south coast, and one of the UK\u2019s largest house builders, Berkley Homes, plans to open <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/31/uk-housebuilders-factories-prefabricating-homes\">a factory in Kent</a> with the aim of producing 1,000 homes a year.</p> <p>Factory-built housing is seen as a way of speeding up productivity and efficiency in construction, a sector that\u2019s been singularly resistant to modernisation. The government aims to get 300,000 new homes built a year by the mid 2020s to fix what it admits is a broken housing market and says that modular homes can play a part in this.</p> <p>Despite pressures on traditional house builders to meet demand, they\u2019ve been slow to adopt new methods of construction. Conventional builders produce homes at the same rate at which they sell them in order to protect their profit margins, so there\u2019s less of a financial incentive to pick up the pace. This is why modular housing has been used primarily for affordable housing schemes, hotels or properties in the rental market. Construction cost for factory-builds is also about 12% higher, according to a report by JLL, the property consultant that led the deal between Sekisui and the UK government. While new entrants to the housing industry are more likely to drive innovation in construction methods, established house builders would have to come on board in order to effect real change, the report says.</p> <p>Whether the big players like it or not, a shake-up is coming. The housing industry has an ageing workforce and relies on migrant labourers from Europe to shore up its skills shortage. Rising labour costs will eventually force a shift towards new construction techniques, Adam Challis, head of living research at JLL, says. \u201c[The industry\u2019s] not recruiting anywhere near the rate people are retiring,\u201d he says. \u201cWe will need to switch to modern methods of construction as a way of offsetting labour irrespective of Brexit, but there\u2019s no question that any labour scarcity from the continent will only exacerbate the problem.\u201d</p> <p>Factory-built homes not only require less labour, they can be built much faster than traditional homes. Though the speed of delivery varies, they can take less than a week to build in a factory. They also have the advantage of being constructed indoors in a controlled environment as opposed to a building site exposed to the elements. Luke Barnes, the co-founder of Ideal Modular Homes, a Liverpool-based manufacturer, says quality is a key differentiator. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t buy a car that\u2019s been built outside in the rain and mud,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a digital quality control system that follows every process in the factory so it leaves with zero defects, unlike traditional builds where after people move in there\u2019s consistent snagging that has to be rectified.\u201d</p> <p>But the technology is not without risk. When it comes to the mass production of anything, from homes to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/02/whirlpool-says-up-to-800000-faulty-dryers-exist\">electrical appliances</a>, there\u2019s always the potential for any error to be replicated. \u201cIf you make a mistake once in construction it\u2019s an isolated issue. In a manufacturing process, you make a mistake once, you make a mistake every time,\u201d says Challis. \u201cManaging systemic risk is the most important upfront issue.\u201d</p> <p>Modular buildings have a lower carbon footprint because there are fewer lorry deliveries to the site, cutting emissions. People living nearby are also less affected by noise, pollution and disruption. Marc Vlessing, the founder of Pocket Living, a London-based affordable housing company, says the method\u2019s eco credentials will be a key driver of demand. \u201cAs residents understand this more, I believe they will press local authorities to ensure homes in their neighbourhood are delivered in this way.\u201d</p> <p>Vlessing, whose firm uses modular construction, believes factory-built housing will have a big part to play in getting people on the property ladder. \u201cWe are in the midst of a housing crisis and we have to find new solutions to break out from the practices that have contributed to it,\u201d he says.</p> <p>But fixing the housing crisis will take more than a government push to increase the number of homes or a switch to speedier new construction methods. \u201cAnything that fails to [address] the power dynamics in the housing system, that fails to address inequality or land ownership, is not going to speak to the real problem,\u201d says David Madden, associate professor in the department of sociology and the cities programme at the London School of Economics. \u201cModular housing could make things more efficient and bring down building costs, but it\u2019s not going to change anything on its own.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 7 and 13 August 2019. Worthing is in West Sussex on the south coast of England, rather than in the south-west as stated in an earlier version. And the government says that it does not have a target to increase modular homes to 100,000 by 2020. Rather it says that modular homes can play a part in its target of building 300,000 homes a year.</p>",

Rising labour costs will eventually force a shift towards new construction techniques, Adam Challis, head of living research at JLL, says. \u201c[The industry\u2019s] not recruiting anywhere near the rate people are retiring,\u201d he says. \u201cWe will need to switch to modern methods of construction as a way of offsetting labour irrespective of Brexit, but there\u2019s no question that any labour scarcity from the continent will only exacerbate the problem.\u201d Factory-built homes not only require less labour, they can be built much faster than traditional homes. Though the speed of delivery varies, they can take less than a week to build in a factory. They also have the advantage of being constructed indoors in a controlled environment as opposed to a building site exposed to the elements. Luke Barnes, the co-founder of Ideal Modular Homes, a Liverpool-based manufacturer, says quality is a key differentiator. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t buy a car that\u2019s been built outside in the rain and mud,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a digital quality control system that follows every process in the factory so it leaves with zero defects, unlike traditional builds where after people move in there\u2019s consistent snagging that has to be rectified.\u201d But the technology is not without risk. When it comes to the mass production of anything, from homes to electrical appliances, there\u2019s always the potential for any error to be replicated. \u201cIf you make a mistake once in construction it\u2019s an isolated issue. In a manufacturing process, you make a mistake once, you make a mistake every time,\u201d says Challis. \u201cManaging systemic risk is the most important upfront issue.\u201d Modular buildings have a lower carbon footprint because there are fewer lorry deliveries to the site, cutting emissions. People living nearby are also less affected by noise, pollution and disruption. Marc Vlessing, the founder of Pocket Living, a London-based affordable housing company, says the method\u2019s eco credentials will be a key driver of demand. \u201cAs residents understand this more, I believe they will press local authorities to ensure homes in their neighbourhood are delivered in this way.\u201d Vlessing, whose firm uses modular construction, believes factory-built housing will have a big part to play in getting people on the property ladder. \u201cWe are in the midst of a housing crisis and we have to find new solutions to break out from the practices that have contributed to it,\u201d he says. But fixing the housing crisis will take more than a government push to increase the number of homes or a switch to speedier new construction methods. \u201cAnything that fails to [address] the power dynamics in the housing system, that fails to address inequality or land ownership, is not going to speak to the real problem,\u201d says David Madden, associate professor in the department of sociology and the cities programme at the London School of Economics. \u201cModular housing could make things more efficient and bring down building costs, but it\u2019s not going to change anything on its own.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 7 and 13 August 2019. Worthing is in West Sussex on the south coast of England, rather than in the south-west as stated in an earlier version. And the government says that it does not have a target to increase modular homes to 100,000 by 2020. Rather it says that modular homes can play a part in its target of building 300,000 homes a year.",

In 2018 Toys R Us, Maplin and Poundworld disappeared as a result.</p>\n    <p>In terms of habits, shoppers are switching to buying online. The likes of Amazon have an unfair advantage because they have a lower business rate bill, which holds down costs and enables online retailers to woo shoppers with low prices. Business rates are taxes, based on the value of commercial property, that are imposed on traditional retailers with physical stores.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>At the same time, there is a move away from buying \u2018stuff\u2019 as more people live in smaller homes and rent rather than buy. Those pressures have come just as rising labour and product costs, partly fuelled by Brexit, have coincided with economic and political uncertainty that has dampened consumer confidence.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What help do retailers need?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Retailers with a high-street presence want the government to change business rates. They also want more political certainty as the potential for a no deal Brexit means some are not only incurring additional costs for stockpiling goods but are unsure about the impact of tariffs after October 2019. Retailers also want more investment in town centres to help them adapt to changing trends, as well as a cut to high parking charges which they say put off shoppers.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the government doing?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>In the October 2018 budget the government announced&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/oct/26/budget-to-offer-business-rates-relief-for-small-shops\">some relief</a>&nbsp;on business rates for independent shopkeepers. It has also set up a \u00a3675m \u2018future high streets\u2019 fund under which local councils can bid for up to \u00a325m towards regeneration projects such as refurbishing local historic buildings and improving transport links. The fund will also pay for the creation of a high street taskforce to provide expertise and hands-on support to local areas.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the outlook in 2019?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Some retailers could go under. Weakened by a difficult Christmas \u2013 which accounts for the entire annual profits of many retailers, and with further Brexit wobbles to come \u2013 retailers are facing a tough 2019. Another rise in the national minimum wage in April and the falling value of the pound against the dollar, which is used to buy goods in the far east, have also added to costs and hit profits.</p>\n    <p><br></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Millen added: \u201cI feel a great sense of loss that a brand that became iconic on the high street and across the world is now likely to close its doors and put an end to everything we put our heart and soul into.

The use of electric scooters was legalised across Germany in June in the hope they may help reduce the carbon footprint of commuter-heavy urban areas. Since then, however, Munich police have caught and reprimanded 418 people for operating them under the influence of alcohol. The scooters have the same drink-drive limits as cars. For Oktoberfest, which starts next month, politicians are calling for restrictions on e-scooters\u2019 access to the main festival site on Theresienwiese square and the surrounding area. \u201cAnyone who\u2019s had one too many should not get on an e-scooter afterwards,\u201d said Kristina Frank of the Christian Social Union party. A number of cities across the country reported accidents involving e-scooters and alcohol over the weekend. In the eastern city of Erfurt, several police officers were injured in a brawl that broke out when they tried to stop a drunken scooter operator. Four e-scooter users in Cologne were seriously injured in accidents, one of them an intoxicated 29-year-old tourist. Other cities around Europe have had similarly sobering experiences with the new technology. Police in Copenhagen arrested 28 people over one weekend last month for riding e-scooters under the influence of cannabis and alcohol. Paris has introduced fines of \u20ac135 (\u00a3120) for riding electric scooters on the pavement and banned them from being parked there. In the UK, where London is the only major European metropolis not to allow e-scooters, the government is leading a review of transport laws that could see them made legal on British streets. \u201cThere are people who enjoy using these vehicles, but many regard them as toys rather than means of transport,\u201d said Helmut Dedy, the head of the Association of German Cities (DST). \u201cWe need clear rules of play and they must be binding,\u201d Dedy told a German collaboration of newspapers called Redaktionsnetzwerk Deutschland. Providers have promised to sign a memorandum outlining rules for e-scooter use in German cities. A recent study by the Civity management consultancy found that e-scooters were mainly used in the late hours of the day and over weekends, raising questions about their attractiveness to commuters. Four main providers \u2013 Tier, Lime, Voi and Circ \u2013 currently provide undocked e-scooters across German cities, which can be unlocked with a smartphone and driven at a maximum speed of 20 km/h on bicycle paths and roads. Riders who stray on to pavements face a \u20ac30 fine. As well as problems with drunken operators and vehicles being steered into pedestrian zones, local people increasingly complain about bad parking. The Green politician Cem \u00d6zdemir criticised Angela Merkel\u2019s government for passing a law to allow their use without having thought through the consequences, and called for mandatory parking zones for the vehicles. \u201cVienna should serve as an example,\u201d he said. In the Austrian capital, the e-scooter provider Bird claims to employ a supervisor for every 100 scooters, tasked with repairing broken-down vehicles and removing those left in the middle of the street. The company also requires users to take a picture of the parked scooter at the end of their journey.",

UBS has been positioning itself to attract more of the savings of the global super-rich as they seek out the stability and privacy of Switzerland\u2019s banks at a time of growing financial instability across the world. The bank employs 23,600 people in its global wealth management division \u201cto provide tailored investment advice and solutions to private clients, in particular in the ultra-high net worth and high net worth segments\u201d. The world\u2019s 500 wealthiest people lost 2.1% of their collective net worth on Monday, as US stock markets had their biggest one-day drop this year. The richest person in the world, Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos, swallowed the biggest paper loss with his fortune falling by $3.4bn, taking it down to $110bn. Twenty-one people on Bloomberg\u2019s billionaires index lost more than $1bn each. Hong Kong\u2019s wealthy are also nursing big losses after weeks of protests and strikes that started over a controversial extradition law, which would have allowed the transfer of suspects to mainland China. The fortunes of the 10 richest people in Hong Kong have fallen by $19bn since 23 July. The paper wealth of its richest man, Li Ka-shing, has dropped by about $2.7bn, or 9%.",

Climate change will see to that. The choice not to turn them away will not be cost-free; there is no costless way to share resources with others. But if we do not, we actively choose the drownings, the detention camps, the funnelling of these people into a life of slave labour in war zones. We choose the hostile environment. We choose to \u201cpreserve our way of life\u201d only by living alongside a growing population of stateless refugees in their foil tents and sweltering warehouses, exhausted to the point of hopelessness. Is there a cost we will finally consider too high to pay? What does it say about us that, so far, it seems there is not? \u2022 Phil McDuff writes on economics and social policy",

Also included are the teenage climate emergency activist Greta Thunberg, and the 17th-century nun and poet Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz, whom they say scandalised readers with her outspoken view on women\u2019s role in society. \u201cEach of these women has fought and won the kinds of victories that pave the way for progress for all of us,\u201d said Clinton. \u201cThis book is a continuation of a conversation Chelsea and I have been having since she was a little girl, and we are excited to welcome others into that conversation.\u201d The pair will also highlight the stories of the civil war surgeon Mary Edwards Walker, who was arrested for wearing trousers; Shirley Chisholm, who ran for US president in 1972; television presenter Ellen DeGeneres; and Manal al-Sharif, who filmed herself driving a car in 2011 in defiance of Saudi Arabian laws. More than 100 women will feature in the book, as the Clintons set out to celebrate \u201cthe histories that all too often get overlooked or are left unwritten\u201d. The Clinton family have produced many books, with Chelsea having previously written She Persisted, a picture book about American women who changed the world. Clinton\u2019s What Happened has sold almost 100,000 copies in the UK since it was published in 2017, with her previous memoirs Living History and Hard Choices bringing her total sales to more than 300,000 copies, according to book sales monitor Nielsen BookScan.",

The retailer, which first opened its doors in New York in 1923, said it would close 15 of its 22 stores, including flagship branches in Chicago, Las Vegas and Seattle, five small concept outlets and seven Barneys Warehouse discount stores. Barneys\u2019 flagship shops on New York\u2019s Madison Avenue, and in Beverly Hills, San Francisco and Boston, are to remain open. Barneys\u2019 decision to file for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection is the latest sign of a tough trading backdrop for US retailers, who are expected to close a total of 9,000 stores this year, according to estimates from Cushman and Wakefield, the property advisory firm. Like many department stores around the world, Barneys has recently been hit by rising rental costs as well as heavy competition from online rivals including luxury goods re-sellers such as The RealReal. The company is continuing to trade after securing $75m in new funds from Hilco Global and Gordon Brothers Group, which have a history of snapping up distressed companies. Barneys is now owned by the investor Richard Perry and the private-equity firm Yucaipa Capital. It previously filed for bankruptcy in the 1990s before enjoying a revival in the days of the designer-obsessed, shopaholic characters featured in the Sex and the City television series. In papers filed in the US bankruptcy court for the southern district of New York, the chain said it had debts of between $100m and $500m. Before an anticipated cash crunch, designer brands had reportedly withheld shipping new orders to the store, a sharp turnaround to years when designers were keen to be listed inside.

In the video, the man and his companion who filmed the incident can be heard joking, \u201crecycling, let\u2019s go, let\u2019s see how many flips it can do\u201d.</p> \n<p>He was identified by the civil guard police who ordered him to haul the fridge back up and recycle it in a proper manner. The police filmed the retrieval which was also posted online.</p> \n<p>The offender was fined \u20ac45,000 (\u00a341,000) and sacked from his job at the waste management firm which also faces possible sanctions of up to \u20ac300,000. Another video has emerged of him disposing of a washing machine in a similar manner.</p> \n<p>When police carried out an inspection of the firm they found 50 washing machines left outside as well as 20 fridges. There was no container for disposing of the goods. The owners were unable to provide evidence that over the last 10 years they had been delivering the waste white goods to a company authorised to recycle them.</p> \n<p>Sergio L\u00f3pez, a civil guard officer, said the 24-year-old man was \u201cactively cooperating\u201d with police and remorseful over his action.</p> \n<p>\u201cI really regret what I\u2019ve done because it\u2019s meant I\u2019ve lost my job and has aggravated the problems I have with anxiety,\u201d he told the online news site El Espa\u00f1ol.</p> \n<p>\u201cAll I want now is for this to go away and the effect it\u2019s having on my family, my girlfriend and me. I don\u2019t want people to have this image of me, as though I were a murderer.\u201d</p> \n<p>Fridges contain gases that can cause serious environmental damage and are among the most toxic white goods if not disposed of correctly, along with freezers and air conditioning units.</p>",

The video went viral after the man, who works for a company that recycles domestic electronic equipment in Olula del R\u00edo in Almer\u00eda was seen tipping the fridge in the Valle de Almanzora. In the video, the man and his companion who filmed the incident can be heard joking, \u201crecycling, let\u2019s go, let\u2019s see how many flips it can do\u201d. He was identified by the civil guard police who ordered him to haul the fridge back up and recycle it in a proper manner. The police filmed the retrieval which was also posted online. The offender was fined \u20ac45,000 (\u00a341,000) and sacked from his job at the waste management firm which also faces possible sanctions of up to \u20ac300,000. Another video has emerged of him disposing of a washing machine in a similar manner. When police carried out an inspection of the firm they found 50 washing machines left outside as well as 20 fridges. There was no container for disposing of the goods. The owners were unable to provide evidence that over the last 10 years they had been delivering the waste white goods to a company authorised to recycle them. Sergio L\u00f3pez, a civil guard officer, said the 24-year-old man was \u201cactively cooperating\u201d with police and remorseful over his action. \u201cI really regret what I\u2019ve done because it\u2019s meant I\u2019ve lost my job and has aggravated the problems I have with anxiety,\u201d he told the online news site El Espa\u00f1ol. \u201cAll I want now is for this to go away and the effect it\u2019s having on my family, my girlfriend and me. I don\u2019t want people to have this image of me, as though I were a murderer.\u201d Fridges contain gases that can cause serious environmental damage and are among the most toxic white goods if not disposed of correctly, along with freezers and air conditioning units.",

They pay high rents for flimsy shacks on land owned by the government and effectively squatted on by landlords. They have no services and the only taxation comes in the form of protection money demanded by police and gangs. Each day is a struggle to scrape together enough money and food to reach the next.</p>\n    <p>Electricity, clean water, toilets, healthcare and schools are either non-existent or not available to all residents. At any one time, 50% of Kibera's 15- to 25-year-old women are pregnant. Abortion is illegal and contraception scarce. Rape and child sex abuse is endemic. Abuse of drink and drugs is rife. Food is cheap but unhealthy \u2013 fizzy drinks are easier to get than clean water.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cIf you\u2019re arrested, you will more than likely pay not to be arrested.\u201d</p> \n<p>Another person wants to know why officers hire out their guns to gangs, perpetuating crime against their community. \u201cThat\u2019s misconduct, such people are not fit to be policemen,\u201d Sulwe says. \u201cThe government is doing its best to eliminate the problem.\u201d</p> \n<p>The people here want more. They want answers about the number of police killings, or \u201cextrajudicial executions\u201d as they are known locally. Sulwe provides an explanation that goes to the heart of such shootings: disillusionment. \u201cIf you tell me someone is a thief, they rob and rape women, and you ask me to arrest him \u2013 but with no evidence \u2013 the judge will ask for evidence.

She wants the inspector to explain why suspects were not simply taken into custody. \u201cYou are just killing us,\u201d she tells him.</p> \n<p>Maina was a football-loving student who had studied at Leeds University. In December 2018 he was heading home in the early hours, having watched a football match with friends in Kibera. An encounter with police resulted in a chase.

Why are such people at risk, not only from suspects, but from corrupt officers working hand-in-hand with criminal gangs? The perception of the audience is clear. Despite a number of high-profile convictions, they believe police fail to protect them and commit crimes against them with impunity.</p> \n<p>Kenya\u2019s government claims to be making an effort to weed out rogue officers and bring them to justice. Figures relating to the number of <a href=\"http://democracyinafrica.org/obtaining-justice-extrajudicial-killings-kenya/\">killings</a> in 2018 vary significantly. One organisation puts the figure at 121, another at 267 \u2013 which would mark a significant increase on the previous year, when there were an estimated 152.</p> \n<p>Data collectors monitor police statistics, news and social media reports, but struggle to obtain accurate information about incidents in Kenya\u2019s 10 slums. Many killings go unreported or the deceased are buried by relatives who say nothing for fear of reprisal.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"86f4116f-4fb6-43de-8f1b-6fba52e9fb97\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>- Estimates of how many people live in Kibera range from 250,000 to 1 million.</p>\n    <p>- Life expectancy is 30 years.</p>\n    <p>- The biggest killers come from diet and dirt.

In Pangani in north-east Nairobi, host to a largely Somali community, residents voice similar concerns. There, specialist police units like \u201cPangani-6\u201d, led by Cpl Ahmed Rachid, have reportedly been involved in alleged unlawful killings. </p> \n<p>Rachid openly admits that his mandate is to rid the streets of gangsters and criminals. \u201cThose we profile, we have to get them alive or dead,\u201d he told a television crew after he was captured on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOjYnSAAcnQ\">film</a> shooting an apparently handcuffed, unarmed suspect. That was in 2017; it appears that in 2019 little has changed. </p> \n<p>Maina\u2019s case and a host of others raise fundamental questions about the conduct of Kenya\u2019s police service. Has the government given certain officers an undisclosed mandate to kill suspects rather than bringing them before the courts? Is the government simply struggling to maintain police discipline? Or is the state simply turning a blind eye to the actions of certain officers in order to focus instead on gang crime and public disorder? </p> \n<p>It has been alleged that some armed officers have openly engaged in<a href=\"https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/article/2001327279/police-officer-arrested-for-robbery\"> robberies</a>, there have been interventions in order to<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-46384297\"> free corrupt officers from detention</a>, and, in one case, <a href=\"https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2019-01-14-ipoa-probes-190-cases-of-suspected-extrajudicial-killings/\">a previously maimed suspect was kidnapped from hospital</a>, and their body discovered days later with gunshot wounds.</p> \n<p>The Kenyan government has to come up with a solution that fits the depth and gravity of the problem. Human rights watchers are still awaiting Kenya\u2019s director of public prosecutions Noordin Haji to make a decision over whether or not the officer implicated in the shooting of Maina will be charged.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>When Kibera cries, the whole of Kenya cries</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Kennedy Odede, Shofco</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p><em>\u201c</em>The problem is complex,\u201d says Ir\u0169ng\u0169 Houghton, Head of Amnesty International in Kenya. \u201cMost officers work within the law. However, it appears that a few have given up on the judicial system, arguing that arresting suspects for serious crime is futile as many are found not guilty and the prisons are full. They take matters into their own hands. Others are simply corrupt, committing crime themselves. These factors fuel extrajudicial killings.\u201d</p> \n<p>Kenya\u2019s 60,000-strong police service is plagued with allegations of unlawful killings, corruption and other misconduct. As of March 2018, the country\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.ipoa.go.ke/\">Independent Policing Oversight Authority</a> were monitoring 9,878 outstanding complaints against police, of which 5,085 were earmarked for detailed investigation.</p> \n<p>There are approximately 2.5 million slum dwellers in Nairobi, representing two thirds of the capital\u2019s population. The largest is Kibera. . Poverty and wrongdoing are apparent on a grand scale. Daylight protects communities from gang activity but allegedly allows some officers to extort money from shopkeepers already struggling to make a living. By night, residents face the savagery of gangs who rob, rape and extort, undeterred by police who tread carefully to avoid confrontation, remaining on the slum\u2019s outskirts and entering only when absolutely necessary \u2013 and then only in sufficient numbers to stave off an ambush from gangs and resentful locals.</p> \n<p>To add to Kibera\u2019s violence, every four years political violence pollutes the slum as electioneering politicians bid for popularity.

      "bodyText": "At a meeting between police and community members in Kibera, Africa\u2019s largest slum in Nairobi, Kenya, where crime is acutely high and mainly unreported, the two sides try to find common ground. There are courteous introductions and then an appeal for openness \u2013 and information \u2013 to help the police tackle Kibera\u2019s crime problems. It\u2019s a frank exchange of words, with the audience seeking confirmation of their rights when they come into contact with police. They remind the officers of the overriding principle of Kenyan law: an individual is innocent until proven guilty, not the reverse. A young man asks why officers take bribes and extort money from the community. \u201cThat is corruption,\u201d responds Insp Nick Sulwe of Kibera\u2019s administration police, firmly. \u201cTo eliminate it you must comply with the law.\u201d \u201cIf you\u2019re arrested, you will more than likely pay not to be arrested.\u201d Another person wants to know why officers hire out their guns to gangs, perpetuating crime against their community. \u201cThat\u2019s misconduct, such people are not fit to be policemen,\u201d Sulwe says. \u201cThe government is doing its best to eliminate the problem.\u201d The people here want more. They want answers about the number of police killings, or \u201cextrajudicial executions\u201d as they are known locally. Sulwe provides an explanation that goes to the heart of such shootings: disillusionment. \u201cIf you tell me someone is a thief, they rob and rape women, and you ask me to arrest him \u2013 but with no evidence \u2013 the judge will ask for evidence. If there is no evidence, he is released and comes back to commit more crime.\u201d A young woman refers to the case of Carilton Maina, a 23-year-old allegedly shot dead by police months earlier. She wants the inspector to explain why suspects were not simply taken into custody. \u201cYou are just killing us,\u201d she tells him. Maina was a football-loving student who had studied at Leeds University. In December 2018 he was heading home in the early hours, having watched a football match with friends in Kibera. An encounter with police resulted in a chase. Maina suffered four gunshot wounds to the chest and one to the head. Authorities say he was \u201cpart of a gang terrorising local residents\u201d something strongly denied by those who knew him. \u201cWhen police officers raid a place \u2026 trust me, they are not wrong,\u201d responds Sulwe. \u201cThere\u2019s something there, there are criminals there. And normally when we come, they open fire. Are we supposed to run away? No, we don\u2019t run away. We fire back. Trust me, if we don\u2019t kill these people, they will kill you.\u201d He is then challenged over the lack of protection for witnesses and those who provide information. Why are such people at risk, not only from suspects, but from corrupt officers working hand-in-hand with criminal gangs? The perception of the audience is clear. Despite a number of high-profile convictions, they believe police fail to protect them and commit crimes against them with impunity. Kenya\u2019s government claims to be making an effort to weed out rogue officers and bring them to justice. Figures relating to the number of killings in 2018 vary significantly. One organisation puts the figure at 121, another at 267 \u2013 which would mark a significant increase on the previous year, when there were an estimated 152. Data collectors monitor police statistics, news and social media reports, but struggle to obtain accurate information about incidents in Kenya\u2019s 10 slums. Many killings go unreported or the deceased are buried by relatives who say nothing for fear of reprisal. Kibera\u2019s residents are not alone. In Pangani in north-east Nairobi, host to a largely Somali community, residents voice similar concerns. There, specialist police units like \u201cPangani-6\u201d, led by Cpl Ahmed Rachid, have reportedly been involved in alleged unlawful killings. Rachid openly admits that his mandate is to rid the streets of gangsters and criminals. \u201cThose we profile, we have to get them alive or dead,\u201d he told a television crew after he was captured on film shooting an apparently handcuffed, unarmed suspect. That was in 2017; it appears that in 2019 little has changed. Maina\u2019s case and a host of others raise fundamental questions about the conduct of Kenya\u2019s police service. Has the government given certain officers an undisclosed mandate to kill suspects rather than bringing them before the courts? Is the government simply struggling to maintain police discipline? Or is the state simply turning a blind eye to the actions of certain officers in order to focus instead on gang crime and public disorder? It has been alleged that some armed officers have openly engaged in robberies, there have been interventions in order to free corrupt officers from detention, and, in one case, a previously maimed suspect was kidnapped from hospital, and their body discovered days later with gunshot wounds. The Kenyan government has to come up with a solution that fits the depth and gravity of the problem. Human rights watchers are still awaiting Kenya\u2019s director of public prosecutions Noordin Haji to make a decision over whether or not the officer implicated in the shooting of Maina will be charged. \u201cThe problem is complex,\u201d says Ir\u0169ng\u0169 Houghton, Head of Amnesty International in Kenya. \u201cMost officers work within the law. However, it appears that a few have given up on the judicial system, arguing that arresting suspects for serious crime is futile as many are found not guilty and the prisons are full. They take matters into their own hands. Others are simply corrupt, committing crime themselves. These factors fuel extrajudicial killings.\u201d Kenya\u2019s 60,000-strong police service is plagued with allegations of unlawful killings, corruption and other misconduct. As of March 2018, the country\u2019s Independent Policing Oversight Authority were monitoring 9,878 outstanding complaints against police, of which 5,085 were earmarked for detailed investigation. There are approximately 2.5 million slum dwellers in Nairobi, representing two thirds of the capital\u2019s population. The largest is Kibera. . Poverty and wrongdoing are apparent on a grand scale. Daylight protects communities from gang activity but allegedly allows some officers to extort money from shopkeepers already struggling to make a living. By night, residents face the savagery of gangs who rob, rape and extort, undeterred by police who tread carefully to avoid confrontation, remaining on the slum\u2019s outskirts and entering only when absolutely necessary \u2013 and then only in sufficient numbers to stave off an ambush from gangs and resentful locals. To add to Kibera\u2019s violence, every four years political violence pollutes the slum as electioneering politicians bid for popularity. Residents allegethe use of criminal gangs to sway voters, creating mayhem and turning Kibera into a tinderbox that sparks conflict in regions of Kenya. It takes little to trigger angry confrontations between stone-throwing mobs and police, who retaliate with tear gas and automatic gunfire. \u201cDuring election time, politicians comes into slums like Kibera, they put Kikuyu against Luyha, Nubians versus Luo, encouraging violence,\u201d says Kennedy Odede, founder of Kibera-based charity Shofco. \u201cPolitically people are used to kill each other. They come here and leave you killing your brother with pangas (machetes) whilst they go and drink champagne in the Serena Hotel. When Kibera cries, the whole of Kenya cries. People are used to kill each other.\u201d In 2007, post-election violence claimed more than 1,000 lives across Kenya. In August 2017, 24 people died following the presidential vote, including a six-month old baby who died after reportedly being struck numerous times by a baton when officers entered a home \u201clooking for protesters\u201d, discharging tear gas and beating the occupants. Earlier this year, an inquest ruled that 36 officers should be held liable for the death. In 2017, Kenya\u2019s police force recorded just 77,992 crimes. In 2018, there were 88,268 recorded crimes, a 13% increase across a population of 52 million. In Kibera, few crimes are reported or registered.

      "bodyText": "Dario Gradi\u2019s long career could be ending in disgrace after an independent inquiry into the football sexual\u2011abuse scandal concluded that he had information that might have stopped one serial offender who is now feared to have preyed on more than 25 victims. According to the findings of a two-and-a-half-year investigation, Gradi failed to report Eddie Heath when they worked together at Chelsea in the early 1970s despite receiving a complaint that his colleague had indecently assaulted one boy in the showers. Instead, Gradi, as Chelsea\u2019s assistant manager, visited the boy\u2019s parents and admits in his own evidence that he did not want the matter to go any further. \u201cI\u2019d got no intention of getting Eddie Heath into trouble,\u201d he says. Heath, the club\u2019s chief scout, went on to abuse boys for many years, with 23 complaints from boys within Chelsea\u2019s youth system, one from a school team and another relating to when he was working for Millwall. Gradi, currently suspended by the Football Association and also facing significant questions about the Barry Bennell scandal at Crewe, has subsequently been accused by Charles Geekie, the QC who was appointed by Chelsea to oversee the inquiry, of giving \u201csomewhat unlikely and unconvincing\u201d evidence. \u201cMr Gradi is the single example of a clear account of an adult in a position of responsibility being informed about an allegation in relation to Mr Heath,\u201d Geekie\u2019s 252-page report states. \u201cThe complaint \u2026 was not referred to more senior members of the club and an opportunity to prevent Mr Heath from going on to abuse others was lost. \u201cThe very purpose of this review is to shine a light on matters such as this. The events involving Mr Gradi are central to the purpose of this review. There is, I consider, a significant public interest in matters such as this being brought fully and openly into view. I consider it absolutely necessary \u2026 to name Mr Gradi.\u201d It can also be revealed that: \u2022 Chelsea\u2019s inquiries have revealed complaints of non-recent sexual abuse relating to three other employees \u2013 one a driver and two scouts \u2013 at Stamford Bridge. \u2022 Heath had a close friendship with another paedophile, John Butcher, and they worked together as scouts for Chelsea. \u2022 Geoff Hurst, one of England\u2019s heroes from the 1966 World Cup, refused to cooperate with the inquiry, despite having been manager of Chelsea when Heath was sacked in 1979. \u2022 Chelsea have found \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d in a separate inquiry that Gwyn Williams, formerly their academy director, subjected young black players to racist remarks \u201con a routine basis\u201d. Gradi, awarded an OBE in 1998 for his services to football, has always denied any wrongdoing since the Guardian\u2019s investigation into sexual abuse in football began what the FA chairman, Greg Clarke, has described as the biggest crisis in the history of the sport. However, it is difficult to see any way that Gradi, 78, can return to the sport now it has been established Crewe\u2019s director of football, still on full pay after being suspended by the FA in December 2016, had been told about a colleague at Chelsea committing a sex act on one boy and decided, according to Geekie\u2019s report, not to report it. In his evidence, Gradi was asked to clarify what the complaint was. \u201cI don\u2019t remember the detail but \u2026 he [Heath] didn\u2019t rape him or anything. He was sexually, I don\u2019t know, touching him, I suppose. I don\u2019t remember. I don\u2019t remember being horrified by it, thinking it was awful, but sorry.\u201d He could recall telling the boy to keep away from Heath and that his colleague had been accused of \u201ctouching him where he shouldn\u2019t have been touching him\u201d. He could also recall offering to \u201ckeep an eye\u201d on the boy from that point onwards, adding: \u201cI probably said something along the lines to partly defend Eddie Heath \u2026 well, he was good with the kids, he\u2019d got a way with the kids and he liked being with the kids and they seemed to like being with him. To be quite honest, I think I would have tried to stand up for Eddie Heath a bit.\u201d Gradi, who went on to manage Crewe in more than 1,000 games, also stated in his evidence that, having left the family home, he did decide the complaint was serious enough to mention it to Ron Suart, who had taken over as manager.

Given the striking, and clearly memorable, nature of the event, this was a significant personal failure by Mr Gradi. It was a lost opportunity to expose Mr Heath and prevent further abuse.\u201d Geekie goes on to state there was no evidence to support Gradi\u2019s assertion, more than 40 years after the event, that the boy was \u201cblaming the sexual stuff going against him as a footballer\u201d. Geekie led a 17-strong legal team that dealt with eight police forces and conducted 139 interviews before reaching their findings. Chelsea\u2019s chairman, Bruce Buck, has met 17 of the victims, hearing evidence that brought him to tears on more than one occasion. A club statement read: \u201cThe board wishes to thank all the survivors and witnesses who came forward to assist the reviews and the club apologises unreservedly for the terrible past experiences of some of our former players.\u201d Chelsea, who are now facing a number of compensation claims, commissioned Barnardo\u2019s to oversee the investigation into allegations that there was a culture of racism and bullying within the club\u2019s youth structure throughout large parts of the 1980s and 1990s. The final report, delivered simultaneously with Geekie\u2019s findings, states that \u201cnumerous examples were given of GW [Williams] humiliating and ridiculing black players by making racially derogatory remarks about them\u201d. Williams, who had a 27-year association with the club, gave evidence that he was not racist and described the evidence against him as \u201cbiased, untrue, unfair and artificial and part of a concerted effort to scapegoat\u201d. Graham Rix, Chelsea\u2019s former youth-team coach, was also investigated, though some of the players relevant to his case were not interviewed. The Barnardo\u2019s team \u201ctakes the view that, while it appears GR [Rix] could be aggressive and bullying, on the evidence presented to them, he was not racially abusive\u201d. Rix has always denied the allegations that were made against him and told the inquiry, via his solicitor, that he would never have contributed to \u201can atmosphere in which would racial abuse would have been tolerated\u201d.",

In 2018-19 the club achieved something incredible in the Championship. They finished as champions with 94 points after scoring 93 goals. Their football was, at times, sumptuous, a possession-based game that thrived on pace out wide and technical players unlocking space in the centre. They had the division\u2019s player of the season and golden boot winner in the shape of Teemu Pukki and, according to the EFL, in Max Aarons they had the best young player in all three divisions. They added 34 points to their previous season\u2019s total. And they did it with a gross spend of less than \u00a35m after a two-year fire sale of talent.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/27/grant-holt-norwich-interview\">Grant Holt: \u2018Who would have thought I\u2019d play in the Premier League?\u2019</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Of Norwich\u2019s three Premier League promotions during the past decade, this one was the best. The sporting director Stuart Webber and head coach Daniel Farke responded publicly to promotion in the way you might expect; they were straight on to the next challenge and the \u2018mountain\u2019 that needed climbing to stay in the top flight. But there will have been a part of them that wanted to stay in the moment, just to take in the enormity of what they achieved.</p> \n<p>The relevant question is to what extent Norwich\u2019s past performance will be indicative of future results. Was last season a fluke or just year one? Did Norwich romp home because they were that good or will they be exposed against tougher opposition? Before a ball has been kicked, the critical consensus is tending towards the latter.</p> \n<p>There are reasons for this. The first is encapsulated in the statistic, revealed by Opta, that Norwich exceeded their expected goals by 20 last season. This means that the team did much better in front of goal than the chances they created would normally merit. On the one hand that\u2019s great; Norwich excelled. On the other, there\u2019s the old saying that everything reverts to the mean. Norwich cannot bank on outperforming in front of goal again, and certainly not against a higher calibre of opposition. When you factor in many of Norwich\u2019s superb results involving late comebacks, this might be a worry.</p> \n<p>There are other numbers that could be a concern. Such as the fact Norwich had the eighth-best defence in the league, conceding more than Nottingham Forest and Stoke. That they shipped 17 goals from set pieces, the sixth-highest total in the league, is a bad omen when roughly 20% of Premier League goals come from this source. Another odd number is that they were dispossessed more often than any other team (perhaps not shocking for a side averaging 55.4% possession, but a stark contrast with Sheffield United, who were dispossessed the least). Boil all that down and you get something like this: Norwich will either have to tighten up or go goal crazy for a second time.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/07/norwich-zip/giv-3902SD0jUnzsGD4Q/\" data-alt=\"Last five seasons\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/07/norwich-zip/giv-3902SD0jUnzsGD4Q/\">Last five seasons</a> \n</figure> \n<p>How likely is that to happen? One way of shoring up the defence would be to recruit. But Norwich have been parsimonious, spending \u00a33.75m to this point. The figure includes a small fee for Sam Byram to West Ham, though the full-back is expected to serve largely as a squad player. There has also been the loan signing of Ralf F\u00e4hrmann from Schalke, a goalkeeper who looks likely to replace Tim Krul and comes with a strong pedigree.</p> \n<p>These deals reflect Norwich\u2019s broader transfer business under Webber; they look to acquire undervalued assets. Or to put it another way, repair damaged goods. F\u00e4hrmann, after several seasons as one of the Bundesliga\u2019s best keepers, lost his place to Alexander N\u00fcbel last year. Byram went to West Ham from Leeds as one of the best prospects in the Championship, but played fewer than 2,000 Premier League minutes in four seasons as he succumbed to injuries.</p> \n<p>Similar stories can be told of City\u2019s two other signings, recruited to bolster the attack. Patrick Roberts was one of the most talked about teens in England when he signed for Manchester City from Fulham. He failed to break into the team however and, last season, struggled to make an impact on loan at Girona. Josip Drmic is a Swistzerland international with Champions League experience but has spent two of the past four years injured and made two league starts for Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach last season.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/07/norwich-zip/giv-3902LwB38iqg9cIA/\" data-alt=\"Last season\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/07/norwich-zip/giv-3902LwB38iqg9cIA/\">Last season</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Norwich say they have no choice but to operate in this way, adopting a \u2018self-financing\u2019 policy in response to their last Premier League season in 2015-16 and relegation that left them holed below the water line. A suspicion remains that there is more money should the right player become available but the likelihood is that Norwich will have to find the solution to staying up from within.</p> \n<p>And that\u2019s where the good news starts. Webber has unearthed no shortage of bargains. Some have been feted \u2013 Pukki and playmaker Emi Buend\u00eda in particular \u2013 but there are several more. Marco Stiepermann joined in 2017 from Bochum as left-back cover. He finished last season as an unconventional No 10 whose physicality and distance shooting consistently unsettled defences. Tom Trybull was a free from Den Haag but had claims to be the Championship\u2019s best defensive midfielder, with league-leading interceptions and pass success in his position.</p> \n<p>Thanks to Webber, Farke has had good raw material to work with. The 42-year-old has then excelled at getting the most from it. Norwich\u2019s defence may have been leaky but they were also highly inexperienced. The average age of Farke\u2019s preferred back four was 21.75, with 26-year-old captain Christoph Zimmermann dragging up the average. Zimmermann was Farke\u2019s captain at Dortmund II and left the Championship having stepped up his level and become an embodiment of the physical commitment demanded by the coach. He played alongside Ben Godfrey, a 21-year-old who shares an agent with Rio Ferdinand and a few other qualities too. A superb athlete, the former midfielder is highly accomplished on the ball and a goal threat with feet and head. The full-backs, Jamal Lewis and Aarons, came from the academy and share the qualities of pace, determination and good judgment.</p> \n<p>It is far from impossible that City\u2019s rearguard learn from their experiences and improve. (This is particularly true if F\u00e4hrmann provides a more reliable presence than the occasionally skittish Krul.)

      "bodyText": "Guardian writers\u2019 predicted position: 17th (NB: this is not necessarily Paul MacInnes\u2019s prediction but the average of our writers\u2019 tips) Last season\u2019s position: 1st in Championship Odds to win the league (via Oddschecker): 2,000-1 Whatever happens next, Norwich City will always have last season. In 2018-19 the club achieved something incredible in the Championship. They finished as champions with 94 points after scoring 93 goals. Their football was, at times, sumptuous, a possession-based game that thrived on pace out wide and technical players unlocking space in the centre. They had the division\u2019s player of the season and golden boot winner in the shape of Teemu Pukki and, according to the EFL, in Max Aarons they had the best young player in all three divisions. They added 34 points to their previous season\u2019s total. And they did it with a gross spend of less than \u00a35m after a two-year fire sale of talent. Of Norwich\u2019s three Premier League promotions during the past decade, this one was the best. The sporting director Stuart Webber and head coach Daniel Farke responded publicly to promotion in the way you might expect; they were straight on to the next challenge and the \u2018mountain\u2019 that needed climbing to stay in the top flight. But there will have been a part of them that wanted to stay in the moment, just to take in the enormity of what they achieved. The relevant question is to what extent Norwich\u2019s past performance will be indicative of future results. Was last season a fluke or just year one? Did Norwich romp home because they were that good or will they be exposed against tougher opposition? Before a ball has been kicked, the critical consensus is tending towards the latter. There are reasons for this. The first is encapsulated in the statistic, revealed by Opta, that Norwich exceeded their expected goals by 20 last season. This means that the team did much better in front of goal than the chances they created would normally merit. On the one hand that\u2019s great; Norwich excelled. On the other, there\u2019s the old saying that everything reverts to the mean. Norwich cannot bank on outperforming in front of goal again, and certainly not against a higher calibre of opposition. When you factor in many of Norwich\u2019s superb results involving late comebacks, this might be a worry. There are other numbers that could be a concern. Such as the fact Norwich had the eighth-best defence in the league, conceding more than Nottingham Forest and Stoke. That they shipped 17 goals from set pieces, the sixth-highest total in the league, is a bad omen when roughly 20% of Premier League goals come from this source. Another odd number is that they were dispossessed more often than any other team (perhaps not shocking for a side averaging 55.4% possession, but a stark contrast with Sheffield United, who were dispossessed the least). Boil all that down and you get something like this: Norwich will either have to tighten up or go goal crazy for a second time. How likely is that to happen? One way of shoring up the defence would be to recruit. But Norwich have been parsimonious, spending \u00a33.75m to this point. The figure includes a small fee for Sam Byram to West Ham, though the full-back is expected to serve largely as a squad player. There has also been the loan signing of Ralf F\u00e4hrmann from Schalke, a goalkeeper who looks likely to replace Tim Krul and comes with a strong pedigree. These deals reflect Norwich\u2019s broader transfer business under Webber; they look to acquire undervalued assets. Or to put it another way, repair damaged goods. F\u00e4hrmann, after several seasons as one of the Bundesliga\u2019s best keepers, lost his place to Alexander N\u00fcbel last year. Byram went to West Ham from Leeds as one of the best prospects in the Championship, but played fewer than 2,000 Premier League minutes in four seasons as he succumbed to injuries. Similar stories can be told of City\u2019s two other signings, recruited to bolster the attack. Patrick Roberts was one of the most talked about teens in England when he signed for Manchester City from Fulham. He failed to break into the team however and, last season, struggled to make an impact on loan at Girona. Josip Drmic is a Swistzerland international with Champions League experience but has spent two of the past four years injured and made two league starts for Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach last season. Norwich say they have no choice but to operate in this way, adopting a \u2018self-financing\u2019 policy in response to their last Premier League season in 2015-16 and relegation that left them holed below the water line. A suspicion remains that there is more money should the right player become available but the likelihood is that Norwich will have to find the solution to staying up from within. And that\u2019s where the good news starts. Webber has unearthed no shortage of bargains. Some have been feted \u2013 Pukki and playmaker Emi Buend\u00eda in particular \u2013 but there are several more. Marco Stiepermann joined in 2017 from Bochum as left-back cover. He finished last season as an unconventional No 10 whose physicality and distance shooting consistently unsettled defences. Tom Trybull was a free from Den Haag but had claims to be the Championship\u2019s best defensive midfielder, with league-leading interceptions and pass success in his position. Thanks to Webber, Farke has had good raw material to work with. The 42-year-old has then excelled at getting the most from it. Norwich\u2019s defence may have been leaky but they were also highly inexperienced. The average age of Farke\u2019s preferred back four was 21.75, with 26-year-old captain Christoph Zimmermann dragging up the average. Zimmermann was Farke\u2019s captain at Dortmund II and left the Championship having stepped up his level and become an embodiment of the physical commitment demanded by the coach. He played alongside Ben Godfrey, a 21-year-old who shares an agent with Rio Ferdinand and a few other qualities too. A superb athlete, the former midfielder is highly accomplished on the ball and a goal threat with feet and head. The full-backs, Jamal Lewis and Aarons, came from the academy and share the qualities of pace, determination and good judgment. It is far from impossible that City\u2019s rearguard learn from their experiences and improve. (This is particularly true if F\u00e4hrmann provides a more reliable presence than the occasionally skittish Krul.) A similar logic applies going forward, where 29-year-old Pukki is surrounded by youngsters. Will the Finn repeat his 30-goal heroics of last season? Unlikely. But is he playing in a team suited to his strengths and with a year of successful experience? Yes. The same goes for pretty much every player, the majority of whom signed new contracts this summer. There are no square pegs in round holes and, to switch metaphors, no bad apples. Just a well-balanced squad of well-coached athletes playing with freedom and little expectation. Yes, they\u2019ll get walloped and the goals will surely not flow as freely. But the club has a plan, a style of play, and proof that it works. There is no doubt the odds are stacked against the Canaries, but those odds might also undervalue their strengths.",

But Sturgeon is too smart to miss an open goal, and right now Johnson is looking like a gift to her cause given his apparent contempt for Scottish feelings about a hard Brexit. A new poll commissioned by the Tory peer Lord Ashcroft puts <a href=\"https://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/poll-majority-of-scots-now-in-favour-of-independence-1-4976640\" title=\"\">52% of Scots now in favour of independence</a>, the biggest lead since Britain voted for Brexit three years ago, with almost half favouring another referendum by 2021. It\u2019s only one poll, obviously; it could easily be an outlier. But, if nothing else, it\u2019s a timely reminder that the newly belligerent Downing Street line on Brexit may have consequences beyond its control.</p> <p>This week\u2019s headlines would be the stuff of nightmares for most new prime ministers: sterling plummeting; high streets suffering as consumer confidence collapses; renewed speculation about the potential breakup of the union, not just in Scotland but in Ireland too. But for the new regime in No 10, they\u2019re a sign that the plan is working. We\u2019ve all bought the line that Johnson intends to Brexit in October with or without a deal, no matter what the cost to the economy, constitution or fabric of society. The greater the panic, in some perverse way the better for Downing Street, whose entire Brexit strategy rests on everyone believing that he actually means it.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The jury is still out on whether this is all simply part of some giant, last-minute game of chicken</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The jury is still out on whether he genuinely does, or whether this is all simply part of some giant, last-minute game of chicken, both with Brussels and with Tory leavers. Johnson\u2019s case has always been that Theresa May failed to extract concessions from the EU because they never seriously believed her when she said no deal would be better than a bad deal, and his aim now is to convince Brussels that this time Britain really is mad enough to leave at any cost. For the other side to believe such a thing, it does not necessarily have to be true, so it remains perfectly possible that Johnson is just blustering on an epic scale; that all those melodramatic Dominic Cummings briefings to special advisers about how deadly serious the government is were simply made to be leaked. Certainly, the EU\u2019s response for now has been to call Johnson\u2019s bluff and refuse to negotiate on his terms.</p> <p>But if it is a bluff, the danger is that it takes on a life of its own, setting in motion a chain of catastrophic events that Downing Street might not be able to stop. Real jobs are being shed as anxious consumers, anticipating trouble ahead, start reining in their spending or manufacturers look to retreat from British operations. Those jobs aren\u2019t going to come flooding back overnight even if October brings some unexpected reprieve. Old party loyalties are snapping as MPs ask themselves how far they are willing to go to stop a no-deal Brexit, and that won\u2019t easily be rebuilt. Even if Johnson cuts a deal at the last minute, voters in both Scotland and Northern Ireland are unlikely to forget how close they came to being dragged off a cliff by the English or how they were treated in the process; their concerns ignored, misrepresented and trampled in the rush. Once lit, a nationalist fire is not so easily put out. Brexiteers, of all people, should surely understand that.</p> <p>\u2022 Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist</p>",

This week\u2019s headlines would be the stuff of nightmares for most new prime ministers: sterling plummeting; high streets suffering as consumer confidence collapses; renewed speculation about the potential breakup of the union, not just in Scotland but in Ireland too. But for the new regime in No 10, they\u2019re a sign that the plan is working. We\u2019ve all bought the line that Johnson intends to Brexit in October with or without a deal, no matter what the cost to the economy, constitution or fabric of society. The greater the panic, in some perverse way the better for Downing Street, whose entire Brexit strategy rests on everyone believing that he actually means it. The jury is still out on whether he genuinely does, or whether this is all simply part of some giant, last-minute game of chicken, both with Brussels and with Tory leavers. Johnson\u2019s case has always been that Theresa May failed to extract concessions from the EU because they never seriously believed her when she said no deal would be better than a bad deal, and his aim now is to convince Brussels that this time Britain really is mad enough to leave at any cost. For the other side to believe such a thing, it does not necessarily have to be true, so it remains perfectly possible that Johnson is just blustering on an epic scale; that all those melodramatic Dominic Cummings briefings to special advisers about how deadly serious the government is were simply made to be leaked. Certainly, the EU\u2019s response for now has been to call Johnson\u2019s bluff and refuse to negotiate on his terms. But if it is a bluff, the danger is that it takes on a life of its own, setting in motion a chain of catastrophic events that Downing Street might not be able to stop. Real jobs are being shed as anxious consumers, anticipating trouble ahead, start reining in their spending or manufacturers look to retreat from British operations. Those jobs aren\u2019t going to come flooding back overnight even if October brings some unexpected reprieve. Old party loyalties are snapping as MPs ask themselves how far they are willing to go to stop a no-deal Brexit, and that won\u2019t easily be rebuilt. Even if Johnson cuts a deal at the last minute, voters in both Scotland and Northern Ireland are unlikely to forget how close they came to being dragged off a cliff by the English or how they were treated in the process; their concerns ignored, misrepresented and trampled in the rush. Once lit, a nationalist fire is not so easily put out. Brexiteers, of all people, should surely understand that. \u2022 Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist",

If so, then like most of Baldrick\u2019s cunning plans, it is destined never to be revealed.</p> <p>Johnson\u2019s pretence of being a buffoon is probably founded on reality. His political record to date certainly indicates this. Any hope that underlying the outward facade there lies a subtle strategist must surely fade away after the confrontational antics in his recent cabinet reshuffle, together with his threatened bluff of taking the choice of new deal or no deal to the EU.</p> <p>The EU leaders have clearly had enough of British prevarication and will most probably leave Johnson with the sole option of calling a general election.</p> <p>The future for the UK is at best grim \u2013 perhaps the only silver lining could be a fresh referendum on Scottish independence coupled with a similar move by Northern Ireland.<br><em>Noel Bird</em><br><em>Boreen Point, Queensland, Australia</em></p> <p><strong>\u2022 </strong>The ascendancy of Donald Trump and Boris Johnson and their vision to make the US and the UK \u201cgreat\u201d again has gone beyond mere hubris to fantasy and delusion.</p> <p>There is a tide of history and it has a power far beyond the capacity of even the best of US presidents and UK prime ministers. There will soon be a period of Chinese dominance and the US needs a next generation of leaders who can deal with the loss of primacy and the adjustments that will be required.

      "bodyText": "Does Boris Johnson really have a cunning plan? It may be that Boris Johnson in his new role as Blackadder does indeed have a Baldrick with a cunning plan to steer the UK through the troubled waters of 31 October, in the shape of Dominic Cummings, who in the words of David Cameron, is \u201ca career psychopath\u201d (2 August). If so, then like most of Baldrick\u2019s cunning plans, it is destined never to be revealed. Johnson\u2019s pretence of being a buffoon is probably founded on reality. His political record to date certainly indicates this. Any hope that underlying the outward facade there lies a subtle strategist must surely fade away after the confrontational antics in his recent cabinet reshuffle, together with his threatened bluff of taking the choice of new deal or no deal to the EU. The EU leaders have clearly had enough of British prevarication and will most probably leave Johnson with the sole option of calling a general election. The future for the UK is at best grim \u2013 perhaps the only silver lining could be a fresh referendum on Scottish independence coupled with a similar move by Northern Ireland. Noel Bird Boreen Point, Queensland, Australia \u2022 The ascendancy of Donald Trump and Boris Johnson and their vision to make the US and the UK \u201cgreat\u201d again has gone beyond mere hubris to fantasy and delusion. There is a tide of history and it has a power far beyond the capacity of even the best of US presidents and UK prime ministers. There will soon be a period of Chinese dominance and the US needs a next generation of leaders who can deal with the loss of primacy and the adjustments that will be required. In the case of the UK there will be further declines in the global pecking order and future UK leaders will have to make the best of that reality. The challenge for the world is to minimise the economic, social, security and cultural damage of Trump and Johnson and pave the way for more effective leaders to emerge to deal with the huge problems of climate emergency, global inequality and poverty. Stewart Sweeney Adelaide, South Australia \u2022 Perhaps future historians will conclude that the Battle of Brexit was lost on the playing fields of Eton? John Wodak Sherwood Park, Alberta, Canada Planting trees is only part of the climate solution So planting 1.7bn hectares of treeless land with 1.2tn native tree saplings will mop up two-thirds of all CO2 emissions related to human activities (12 July). And if we can somehow arrest CO2 concentrations at current levels, we\u2019ll be back to 1975 levels. Sounds good, but is it really achievable? The quickest way to capture carbon is planting fast-growing species, but not for 30 cents per tree, as this requires nutrient inputs, pest control and enough rainfall. Altering landscapes can change the soil, which can work against reintroducing native species. Thus planting native tree saplings is unlikely to work.

The \u201cBasic Law\u201d constitution guarantees to protect, for the next 50 years, the democratic institutions that make&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong&nbsp;distinct from Communist-ruled mainland China.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2003:&nbsp;</b>Hong&nbsp;Kong\u2019s leaders introduce legislation that would forbid acts of treason and subversion against the Chinese government. The bill resembles laws used to charge dissidents on the mainland. An estimated half a million people turn out to protest against the bill. As a result of the backlash, further action on the proposal is halted.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2007:&nbsp;</b>The Basic Law stated that the ultimate aim was for&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong\u2019s voters to achieve a complete democracy, but China decides in 2007 that universal suffrage in elections for the chief executive cannot be implemented until 2017. Some lawmakers are chosen by business and trade groups, while others are elected by vote. In a bid to accelerate a decision on universal suffrage, five lawmakers resign. But this act is followed by the adoption of the Beijing-backed electoral changes, which expand the chief executive\u2019s selection committee and add more seats for lawmakers elected by direct vote. The legislation divides Hong&nbsp;Kong's pro-democracy camp, as some support the reforms while others say they will only delay full democracy while reinforcing a structure that favors Beijing.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2014:&nbsp;</b>The Chinese government introduces a bill allowing Hong&nbsp;Kong&nbsp;residents to vote for their leader in 2017, but with one major caveat: the candidates must be approved by Beijing. Pro-democracy lawmakers are incensed by the bill, which they call an example of \u201cfake universal suffrage\u201d and \u201cfake democracy\u201d. The move triggers a massive protest as crowds occupy some of&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong\u2019s most crowded districts for 70 days. In June 2015,&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong&nbsp;legislators formally reject the bill, and electoral reform stalls.

      "bodyText": "Chinese authorities and masked protesters have held rival press conferences in an attempt to take control of the narrative amid escalating demonstrations in Hong Kong. In a rare press conference on Tuesday, Beijing sounded its strongest warning yet to protesters not to underestimate the power of the Chinese government. Calling the demonstrators \u201cbrazen, violent and criminal actors\u201d, Yang Guang, a spokesman for the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office of the Chinese government, said: \u201cDon\u2019t misjudge the situation or take restraint as a sign of weakness \u2026 don\u2019t underestimate the firm resolve and tremendous power by the central government.\u201d Yang responded to questions about whether Beijing would deploy its military in Hong Kong by reiterating the Chinese government\u2019s support of Hong Kong\u2019s leader, Carrie Lam. Yang said that with the backing of the Chinese government and the people of China, the Hong Kong government and police were \u201cfully capable of punishing those criminal activities and restoring order\u201d. Yet, across the border in the city of Shenzhen, police took part in riot training in footage released by the state-run Global Times on Tuesday. Officers faced people dressed in black and wearing colourful hard hats \u2013 outfits that evoked those worn by Hong Kong protesters \u2013 throwing petrol bombs, pushing a trolley on fire towards police, and hitting officers with wooden sticks. Earlier on Tuesday, masked protesters staged their first \u201ccivilian press conference\u201d, in response to government and police press briefings. \u201cNetizens have initiated the citizens\u2019 press conference, to bring the people\u2019s unheard voice to the public and to highlight the repeated condemnations and empty rhetoric presented by the [Hong Kong] government,\u201d said an unidentified speaker wearing a yellow hard hat, accompanied by a sign language translator. The dual press conferences took place a day after some of the worst confrontations between protesters and police, who clashed in at least seven districts of the semi-autonomous city. Police fired teargas and rubber bullets at protesters who occupied roads and vandalised police stations and arrested 148 people aged between 13 and 63 on suspicion of assault and possession of offensive weapons. Hong Kong, in its ninth week of consecutive mass protests, is facing its most serious political crisis since the former British colony was returned to Chinese control in 1997. Like much of the protest movement, the demonstrators\u2019 press gathering was organised on the online forum LIHKG, the city\u2019s version of Reddit, and those speaking sought to make it clear they had no political or organisational affiliation, and did not represent all the protesters. It came after Lam on Monday announced the police would hold daily press conferences. One of the group\u2019s first orders of business was to provide a counter-narrative to claims by the Hong Kong government that the economic slowdown was due to the protests, instead placing the blame squarely on global economic problems. Later, the speakers reiterated the five demands of the protesters, called for a return of \u201cpower back to the people\u201d, and said the \u201cpursuit of democracy\u201d was \u201cthe inalienable right of the people\u201d. News of Monday\u2019s violence filtered into mainland China, where censors have been allowing more discussion of the protests, framed as riots. On the social media platform Weibo the hashtag #FujianFellows was trending alongside videos of men in white grabbing long bamboo sticks to beat protesters and \u201cprotect ordinary neighbours\u201d. Their attack on protesters was reminiscent of a more brutal attack by men similarly dressed in white on 21 July in and around a subway train station in the district of Yuen Long, in which at least 45 people were injured. The US House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, issued a statement in support of the protesters: \u201cThe people of Hong Kong are sending a stirring message to the world: the dreams of freedom, justice and democracy can never be extinguished by injustice and intimidation.\u201d She said their courage was extraordinary while Hong Kong\u2019s government was \u201ccowardly\u201d, and said it was refusing to respect the rule of law and called for it to meet the Hongkongers\u2019 legitimate democratic aspirations. China\u2019s foreign ministry released a statement on Tuesday rebuking Pelosi, saying her words and that of others in support of Hong Kong\u2019s protesters had made the demonstrators \u201ceven more fearless and lawless\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson could simply ignore a parliamentary vote of no confidence and proceed with a no-deal Brexit followed by an election, unless MPs can form an alternative government in 14 days, a former senior judge has said. Jonathan Sumption, a former supreme court judge, said Johnson would be entitled to stay on as prime minister even if he lost a confidence vote. Under the law, MPs would have two weeks to create an alternative government before an election was automatically triggered. In those circumstances, the prime minister would have the power to set the date of the election for after 31 October, following the UK\u2019s departure from the EU with or without a deal. Lord Sumption told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme the prime minister \u201ccould fix the date for polling\u201d. He said there were two main ways MPs fighting a no-deal Brexit could prevent it from happening. The first was to \u201cpass a statute which limited the right of the government to have a no-deal Brexit by saying they had to revoke article 50\u201d and the second would be an interim government, he said. Sumption argued both options seemed like \u201cvery long shots\u201d, given the parliamentary arithmetic, but conceded the political situation was unpredictable, given the high stakes of a no-deal Brexit. Johnson has insisted he wants a deal with Brussels but has refused to sit down for talks until the EU agreed to scrap what he called the \u201cundemocratic backstop\u201d \u2013 the mechanism to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland that could keep the UK in a customs union. Dominic Cummings, Johnson\u2019s senior adviser and architect of the leave vote, has made clear he would do \u201cwhatever necessary\u201d to take the UK out of the EU by 31 October and EU officials are said to be under the impression that Brexit without a deal is the most likely scenario. There are signs Johnson is preparing for being forced into an election by parliament, even though he insists it is the \u201clast thing\u201d he wants. Speculation intensified after it emerged he has brought in Isaac Levido, the righthand man of the Australian election guru Lynton Crosby, to a new campaigning role at Conservative party headquarters. Rebel Tory MPs are in talks with senior Labour figures about whether a government of national unity can be formed to stop Johnson pursuing no deal. It could potentially be led by a centre-right, pro-EU Tory such as Ken Clarke or David Lidington, with the sole aim of requesting an extension to article 50, but the consequences after that are unclear. Their preferred method is to use legislation to prevent a no-deal Brexit, rather than trying to collapse the government, but No 10 will do everything possible to deny them the opportunity for that. Vernon Bogdanor, the constitutional expert at King\u2019s College London, warned it would be a \u201cHerculean task\u201d for backbenchers to stop a no-deal Brexit at this stage but listed four possible legislative ways plus the option of bringing down the government.",

But the more I consider it, the more sense it makes. It\u2019s clear that migration figures heavily in Steinbeck\u2019s story, about the Joad family\u2019s desperate exodus from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust_Bowl\">the dust bowl in Oklahoma</a> and their long haul to California looking for work and dignity. It was also a popular choice, receiving many nominations, and is of course a hugely important novel.</p> <p>While I\u2019m making admissions, I should also say that when I first read this book as a cynical teenager, I thought it was heavy-footed and sentimental. Since then, however, I\u2019ve read plenty more by Steinbeck (including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2017/apr/25/cannery-row-sentimental-shallow-john-steinbeck\">Cannery Row</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2017/apr/18/john-steinbecks-tortilla-flat-is-not-for-literary-slummers\">Tortilla Flat</a> with the reading group \u2013 he\u2019s one of our first repeat authors) and come to appreciate his humane genius. I also now understand that neither the subject matter nor the situation Steinbeck was writing about in the late 1930s demanded subtlety. If he laid it on thick, it\u2019s because that\u2019s what was required.</p> <p>You get a good impression of that urgency from looking at contemporary journalists writing about the novel\u2019s immediate impact. On 28 August 1939, the Manchester Guardian\u2019s New York correspondent wrote in amazement about \u201cthe extraordinary consequences\u201d of the US publication of the novel in April. \u201cSteinbeck has been able to capture the imagination of the general public as no one else has been able to do,\u201d wrote the reporter. \u201cWith his ability as a novelist he has made the victims of the California situation seem like real people, and not just statistics on a chart. As a result, great strides are now being taken towards aiding those migratory workers.\u201d The article suggested the book had had a direct impact on government policy as well as stirring up public feeling, not to mention angry \u201clocal patriotism\u201d in California. It even cited rumours that a film studio had bought the rights to the book just to stop it from being filmed and causing greater ructions.</p> <p>When Wilfrid Gibson reviewed the book in the Guardian barely a month later, he made the book feel yet more momentous. He started: \u201cAlthough the reading of novels as a relaxation may help one through a period of suspense, when the world is actually crashing into war it is difficult even for the most conscientious reviewer to give the consideration of works of fiction the undistracted concentration that is essential to a just assessment of their values.\u201d</p> <p>Gibson\u2019s conclusion is worth quoting at length \u2013 for all sorts of reasons, which will be immediately apparent:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>He is a conscientious realist; and if at times, after the fashion of the modish novelist, he would seem to dwell unduly on the description of the operation of the ordinary bodily functions, with him this preoccupation is seldom offensive because his presentation of the lives of these primitive people is in all respects to authentic. This is a terrible and an indignant book; yet it is not without passages of lyrical beauty, and the ultimate impression conveyed is that of the dignity of the human spirit under the stress of the most desperate conditions.</p> </blockquote> <p>Incredible.</p> <p><a href=\"https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/97/07/06/home/history-grapes.html\">The New York Times review</a>, from April 1939, seems almost staid in comparison, although it, too, called the book \u201cas pitiful and angry a novel ever to be written about America\u201d, and concluded: \u201cThe real truth is that Steinbeck has written a novel from the depths of his heart with a sincerity seldom equalled. It may be an exaggeration, but it is the exaggeration of an honest and splendid writer.\u201d</p> <p>Since then, The Grapes of Wrath has passed into legend. Steinbeck won a Pulitzer in 1940 and the novel was cited prominently when he won the Nobel in 1960. John Ford\u2019s film was made and <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0032551/\">won two Oscars</a>. The book has sold millions of copies, been the subject of countless school essays and university dissertations. Better still, it also inspired Bruce Springsteen to write The Ghost of Tom Joad and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-mq0uJ7rlM\">so gave us this.</a></p> <p>Thank you, Steinbeck. After that buildup, I\u2019m excited again. It\u2019s a long one, so we\u2019ll take it in stages \u2013 but it\u2019s also written with Steinbeck\u2019s trademark clarity and directness, not to mention his emotional fire. It\u2019s going to be a big journey.

      "body": "<p>It is perhaps the ultimate comfort food: a potato roasted in the oven for so long that it is almost forgotten, until its skin blisters and cracks open, mouth-burning steam pours out and the soft insides then slathered with butter and almost anything else you can get your hands on.</p> <p>I remember, as a child, being dropped off at my auntie\u2019s house during the summer holidays when my mum was at work. She would slow-roast purplish potatoes the size of my fist, stuffing them with unholy amounts of butter, cold cottage cheese, sweetcorn and maybe some tuna. A stodgier, budget version of Proust\u2019s madeleine, every time I eat a jacket potato now, it is made in the same way and it suddenly brings back those rose-tinted memories \u2013 although it never quite tastes as it did before.</p> <p>With the news that Spudulike, the jacket potato high-street chain, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/aug/04/spudulike-closes-all-37-outlets-as-high-street-downturn-continues\" title=\"\">is closing its 37 branches for good on Friday</a>, we asked chefs, food writers and our readers about their own spud stories and their ultimate toppings, from classic beans and cheese to whipped pig fat or seaweed.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018You don\u2019t want to reinvent the wheel \u2013 it\u2019s comfort food\u2019</strong></h2> <p><em>Bob Granleese, food writer, the Guardian</em></p> <p>My favourite topping is beans, cheese and butter. Bake the potato in the oven on its own and then add the salted butter \u2013 a fair amount of it \u2013 the beans, which have to be Heinz, and then mature cheddar. My daughter likes them with no butter, mozzarella and tomatoes \u2013 which is just wrong.</p> <p>You don\u2019t want to reinvent the wheel, the jacket potato is comfort food, so keep it simple, don\u2019t fanny about. Having said that, the best one I ever had was in Tuscany, where this restaurant I went to had wrapped the potato in tinfoil, baked it and then topped it with masses of whipped lardo, which is pig fat. It was delicious.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018An absolute staple for plant-based eaters on the go\u2019</strong></h2> <p><em>Kirsty, London</em></p> <p>A baked potato with plain beans is often the only vegan option at local cafes or at your nan\u2019s house. Therefore, it is an absolute staple for plant-based eaters on the go. I like my potatoes microwaved (because who can be bothered to cook them in the oven?) with two cuts criss-crossed on top, a side of spinach and covered with beans and vegan cheese.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018The perfect antidote to rain and grey skies\u2019</strong></h2> <p><em>Meriel Armitage, founder of Club Mexicana</em></p> <p>I grew up in the north-west of England, so jacket potatoes were an absolute staple \u2013 they were the perfect antidote to the rain and grey skies. I remember there was a Spudulike near Piccadilly station, it was like a \u201cwelcome to Manchester\u201d beacon; steam would come out of the front door every time it was opened and you could barely see inside because the windows were so foggy.</p> <p>I have three favourite childhood memories of baked potatoes, which are all vegan: \u201ctuna mayo\u201d and sweetcorn, my baked bean \u201chotpot\u201d recipe, devised when I was eight years old, and \u201cchilli con carne\u201d and cheese. For the tuna mayonnaise, mash up chickpeas, vegan mayo, seaweed, capers, red onion, sweetcorn, spring onion, dill and mustard. The baked bean hotpot does what it says, really: cook onions, peppers and tomatoes in oil until soft and then add the beans. Finally, chilli con carne, which can be made with mixed beans, or a vegan alternative to minced meat. Chop onion and garlic, add mince, paprika and your favourite herbs and chillies with tinned tomatoes and tomato paste. I like to add a tiny bit of Marmite to make it taste more \u201cmeaty\u201d, too. Keep cooking it and tinker with the seasoning to taste. Finish off with grated vegan cheese.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a13c10582ee1b60e0c9794259fe4bcb0e955cf66\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a13c10582ee1b60e0c9794259fe4bcb0e955cf66/0_230_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018It shouldn\u2019t need to be said the potato must be baked with lots of salt and oil ...\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It shouldn\u2019t need to be said the potato must be baked with lots of salt and oil ...\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: robynmac/Getty/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>\u2018Everyone loves a great baked potato\u2019</strong></h2> <p><em>Jane Nielsen, Denmark</em></p> <p>I came across Spudulike for the first time when I lived in Edinburgh. I fell completely in love with the concept of the store, and their coronation chicken potato was one of my first meals in Scotland. I spent more than 30 very happy years eating their potatoes. Everyone loves a great baked potato.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018I love them with sweet, slow-cooked leeks\u2019</strong></h2> <p><em>Anna Jones, food writer</em></p> <p>Baked potatoes are up there with my favourite foods; I love them with sweet slow-cooked leeks, mixed with grated cheddar, wholegrain mustard, a little creme fraiche and lemon zest. I also love them with baked beans and cheese with lots of black pepper.</p> <p>The best one I\u2019ve ever had was at a beachside restaurant in Biarritz a few summers ago. It was in a fish restaurant, and I don\u2019t eat fish, so I was a bit sullen about the prospect, so just ordered the sides of baked potato and salad. The potatoes were perfectly baked in hot coals, then cut open and topped with a dot of salty butter and cream cheese \u2013 they were perfect and so simple.</p> <p>When I\u2019m making my own, I like to wash the skins well, making sure not to pierce the potato \u2013 keeping the skin intact is what results in a fluffy inside \u2013 then while still wet I scatter with salt and rub into the wet skin which helps it stick.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018Cooking a baked potato expresses my love for my fiancee\u2019</strong></h2> <p><em>John Paul, New York</em></p> <p>I associate the baked potato with moving in with my fiancee and learning to cook for both of us. In many ways, cooking and serving a dish with a baked potato expresses my love for my fiancee. It\u2019s me trying to bring a sense of peace and calm into our busy lives. It\u2019s best served with healthy pats of butter and sour cream with cracked blacked pepper on top.

Spudulike\u2019s potatoes were hard and soft at the same time, with thin pale skin \u2013 nothing like the crisp dark skin my mother would produce on a jacket in our kitchen at home. The cheese was dusty and almost flavourless and the beans were undercooked and too sweet, but I loved a trip there for a clandestine lunch with my pals.

I particularly associate it with student life, cooking these in the mini oven on prongs. Baked potatoes are total comfort food, and, of course, are delicious with ratatouille, chilli or cottage cheese and pickle. Lots of butter is essential, also lots of salt. And it shouldn\u2019t need to be said that the baked potato must be baked with lots of oil.</p> <p>It\u2019s sad to see Spudulike go, also sad that a simple and comforting (and cheap) takeaway food has disappeared, steamrollered by fancy burger joints.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018It was a favourite for my kids when they were growing up\u2019</strong></h2> <p><em>Jennifer, Manchester</em></p> <p>I often cooked this jacket potato recipe for my children, it became a big favourite and they still remember how much they enjoyed it.

      "bodyText": "It is perhaps the ultimate comfort food: a potato roasted in the oven for so long that it is almost forgotten, until its skin blisters and cracks open, mouth-burning steam pours out and the soft insides then slathered with butter and almost anything else you can get your hands on. I remember, as a child, being dropped off at my auntie\u2019s house during the summer holidays when my mum was at work. She would slow-roast purplish potatoes the size of my fist, stuffing them with unholy amounts of butter, cold cottage cheese, sweetcorn and maybe some tuna. A stodgier, budget version of Proust\u2019s madeleine, every time I eat a jacket potato now, it is made in the same way and it suddenly brings back those rose-tinted memories \u2013 although it never quite tastes as it did before. With the news that Spudulike, the jacket potato high-street chain, is closing its 37 branches for good on Friday, we asked chefs, food writers and our readers about their own spud stories and their ultimate toppings, from classic beans and cheese to whipped pig fat or seaweed. \u2018You don\u2019t want to reinvent the wheel \u2013 it\u2019s comfort food\u2019 Bob Granleese, food writer, the Guardian My favourite topping is beans, cheese and butter. Bake the potato in the oven on its own and then add the salted butter \u2013 a fair amount of it \u2013 the beans, which have to be Heinz, and then mature cheddar. My daughter likes them with no butter, mozzarella and tomatoes \u2013 which is just wrong. You don\u2019t want to reinvent the wheel, the jacket potato is comfort food, so keep it simple, don\u2019t fanny about. Having said that, the best one I ever had was in Tuscany, where this restaurant I went to had wrapped the potato in tinfoil, baked it and then topped it with masses of whipped lardo, which is pig fat. It was delicious. \u2018An absolute staple for plant-based eaters on the go\u2019 Kirsty, London A baked potato with plain beans is often the only vegan option at local cafes or at your nan\u2019s house. Therefore, it is an absolute staple for plant-based eaters on the go. I like my potatoes microwaved (because who can be bothered to cook them in the oven?) with two cuts criss-crossed on top, a side of spinach and covered with beans and vegan cheese. \u2018The perfect antidote to rain and grey skies\u2019 Meriel Armitage, founder of Club Mexicana I grew up in the north-west of England, so jacket potatoes were an absolute staple \u2013 they were the perfect antidote to the rain and grey skies. I remember there was a Spudulike near Piccadilly station, it was like a \u201cwelcome to Manchester\u201d beacon; steam would come out of the front door every time it was opened and you could barely see inside because the windows were so foggy. I have three favourite childhood memories of baked potatoes, which are all vegan: \u201ctuna mayo\u201d and sweetcorn, my baked bean \u201chotpot\u201d recipe, devised when I was eight years old, and \u201cchilli con carne\u201d and cheese. For the tuna mayonnaise, mash up chickpeas, vegan mayo, seaweed, capers, red onion, sweetcorn, spring onion, dill and mustard. The baked bean hotpot does what it says, really: cook onions, peppers and tomatoes in oil until soft and then add the beans. Finally, chilli con carne, which can be made with mixed beans, or a vegan alternative to minced meat. Chop onion and garlic, add mince, paprika and your favourite herbs and chillies with tinned tomatoes and tomato paste. I like to add a tiny bit of Marmite to make it taste more \u201cmeaty\u201d, too. Keep cooking it and tinker with the seasoning to taste. Finish off with grated vegan cheese. \u2018Everyone loves a great baked potato\u2019 Jane Nielsen, Denmark I came across Spudulike for the first time when I lived in Edinburgh. I fell completely in love with the concept of the store, and their coronation chicken potato was one of my first meals in Scotland. I spent more than 30 very happy years eating their potatoes. Everyone loves a great baked potato. \u2018I love them with sweet, slow-cooked leeks\u2019 Anna Jones, food writer Baked potatoes are up there with my favourite foods; I love them with sweet slow-cooked leeks, mixed with grated cheddar, wholegrain mustard, a little creme fraiche and lemon zest. I also love them with baked beans and cheese with lots of black pepper. The best one I\u2019ve ever had was at a beachside restaurant in Biarritz a few summers ago. It was in a fish restaurant, and I don\u2019t eat fish, so I was a bit sullen about the prospect, so just ordered the sides of baked potato and salad. The potatoes were perfectly baked in hot coals, then cut open and topped with a dot of salty butter and cream cheese \u2013 they were perfect and so simple. When I\u2019m making my own, I like to wash the skins well, making sure not to pierce the potato \u2013 keeping the skin intact is what results in a fluffy inside \u2013 then while still wet I scatter with salt and rub into the wet skin which helps it stick. \u2018Cooking a baked potato expresses my love for my fiancee\u2019 John Paul, New York I associate the baked potato with moving in with my fiancee and learning to cook for both of us. In many ways, cooking and serving a dish with a baked potato expresses my love for my fiancee. It\u2019s me trying to bring a sense of peace and calm into our busy lives. It\u2019s best served with healthy pats of butter and sour cream with cracked blacked pepper on top. There\u2019s something beautiful about a baked potato flavoured with simple condiments as they don\u2019t mask the taste of the potato, they enhance it. \u2018The best jacket potato I\u2019ve ever had is my wife\u2019s\u2019 Robin Gill, founder, Darby\u2019s restaurant My go-to home comfort jacket potato has to be with tuna mayonnaise, sweetcorn and lashings of tabasco. For something more extravagant, I top my jacket potato with creme fraiche, Exmoor caviar and fresh chives. The best jacket potato I\u2019ve ever had, however, is my wife Sara\u2019s \u2013 her tuna mayonnaise and sweetcorn is a classic. In terms of tips for cooking your own potato, firstly make sure you choose one that is suitable for baking or frying, such as a maris piper or king edward. If the potato is too moist, it will become soggy. Before baking, spike it with a fork as this makes it bake quicker and all the way through; you want it to be tender and fluffy with a crisp skin.

      "bodyText": "A university professor has hit out at the Home Office after being stopped about 100 times in seven years at airports despite having no criminal record. Prof David Baker, a specialist in neuroimmunology at Queen Mary University in London, who has carried out pioneering work into treatments for conditions such as multiple sclerosis and travels frequently for his work, was once stopped three times in a single week by Border Force officials at airports. Baker, 57, has never been arrested and after being diverted from an automated gate to an official he has been allowed to travel. His repeated attempts to get an explanation from the Home Office about why he is continually stopped and questioned at airports have failed. He questioned the safety and reliability of the Home Office\u2019s security databases, saying that he is being confused with one or more individuals with the same name. \u201cI started asking questions and got evasion most times. On a number of instances I was told it was my name, and not me,\u201d he said. \u201cOn one occasion I was told that I have the same name as a drug dealer and would never get into the UK without being stopped. Surely I have a right to know why I am being stopped. \u201cIf I am not the issue, there must be a solution. A biometric passport must be able to carry sufficient information to show that I am not the criminal they are trying to track.\u201d Baker has found media reports relating to four other David Bakers who have convictions for drugs and/or violence offences. However, none have the same date or place of birth as him. He is so frustrated by his frequent stops for no apparent legitimate reason while travelling that he is contemplating changing his name by deed poll. \u201cThis is driving me nuts,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Home Office is not admitting that there is a problem. It\u2019s a real pain for anyone I travel with, too. While they go through the gates I am stopped and taken aside.\u201d Baker has sometimes been stopped at airports even before he reaches the facial recognition cameras, so he believes the flaw is not with this technology. Baker\u2019s case follows that of Antonio Heslop, an innocent Jamaican man whom the Home Office accused of being a convicted drug dealer and threatened with deportation. The Home Office later apologised to him and said it was a case of mistaken identity. Last week government officials confirmed that Heslop had satisfied all checks on him and that they would issue his biometric residence permit in the coming days. A Home Office spokesman said: \u201cBorder Force\u2019s priority is to maintain security on the border at all times, which is why all those arriving in the UK are examined and checked against Home Office databases. \u201cOur ePassport gates work by using facial recognition technology as well as biographical and security checks. There are a number of technical and security reasons why a passport may fail to be accepted at automated border controls.\u201d The spokesman added that they did not routinely comment on individual cases.",

Firstly, the US Olympic and Paralympic Committee must give $20m a year to the US Center for SafeSport, the organization set up to stop the sexual abuse of young athletes. The Center opened its offices in March 2017 and<a href=\"http://safesport.rassmantech.webfactional.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/ColonAnnouncement_PressRelease_Final.pdf\"> got a new CEO</a> in July \u2013 Ju\u2019Riese Col\u00f3n, who has a background in children\u2019s safety issues that critics say previous leaders have lacked. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/01/ashley-wagner-sexual-assault-john-coughlin\">Ashley Wagner: Olympian says she was assaulted by fellow US skater Coughlin</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Secondly, Congress will grant itself power to dissolve the USOPC board and fire staff. Lawmakers could also terminate national governing bodies, such as USA Gymnastics. That organization has been widely criticized for its mishandling the Nassar case, in which dozens of young athletes were sexually abused. </p> <p>Neither senator\u2019s media staff responded to questions on whether such a move would violate the Olympic Charter\u2019s insistence on autonomy, and the International Olympic Committee declined to comment.</p> <p>While the bill is decisive and has been lauded by some survivors of sexual abuse and media pundits, it has a diverse array of critics. The Committee to Restore Integrity to the USOPC, a group of more than 200 Olympians and advocates also known as Team Integrity, released a statement saying the bill doesn\u2019t include<a href=\"https://www.insidethegames.biz/media/file/130910/Team%2BIntegrity%2BAthlete%2BFirst%2BRecommendations%2Bto%2BUSOC%2B1%2B21%2B2019.pdf\"> several of their recommendations</a> and does not adequately address \u201cfear of retaliation and a lack of power balance between the elite athletes and the USOPC.\u201d</p> <p>Another issue is whether the money USOPC must pay to SafeSport will come out of the pockets of the very athletes the bill intends to protect. The USOPC typically runs a deficit of tens of millions of dollars in non-Olympic years and an equivalent surplus in Olympic years.

      "bodyText": "Has Congress finally taken up the leadership reins in combating sexual abuse in Olympic sports? Or are we seeing just another round of grandstanding to make people think the issue is finally being taking seriously? Last week, US senators Richard Blumenthal and Jerry Moran released a 235-page report summing up an 18-month investigation into sexual abuse in sports, prompted by the crimes of former USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar. The senators are also releasing a bill that goes far beyond the benign legislation of the past, instead issuing a demand and a threat. Firstly, the US Olympic and Paralympic Committee must give $20m a year to the US Center for SafeSport, the organization set up to stop the sexual abuse of young athletes. The Center opened its offices in March 2017 and got a new CEO in July \u2013 Ju\u2019Riese Col\u00f3n, who has a background in children\u2019s safety issues that critics say previous leaders have lacked. Secondly, Congress will grant itself power to dissolve the USOPC board and fire staff. Lawmakers could also terminate national governing bodies, such as USA Gymnastics. That organization has been widely criticized for its mishandling the Nassar case, in which dozens of young athletes were sexually abused. Neither senator\u2019s media staff responded to questions on whether such a move would violate the Olympic Charter\u2019s insistence on autonomy, and the International Olympic Committee declined to comment. While the bill is decisive and has been lauded by some survivors of sexual abuse and media pundits, it has a diverse array of critics. The Committee to Restore Integrity to the USOPC, a group of more than 200 Olympians and advocates also known as Team Integrity, released a statement saying the bill doesn\u2019t include several of their recommendations and does not adequately address \u201cfear of retaliation and a lack of power balance between the elite athletes and the USOPC.\u201d Another issue is whether the money USOPC must pay to SafeSport will come out of the pockets of the very athletes the bill intends to protect. The USOPC typically runs a deficit of tens of millions of dollars in non-Olympic years and an equivalent surplus in Olympic years. Its biggest expenses are on training facilities ($28.9m in 2018) and supporting the national governing bodies. The $110m it paid out in 2018 to the governing bodies ranged from $6.09m to US Ski and Snowboard to $131,000 to USA Badminton. \u201cVirtually every Olympian at some point goes through a training center,\u201d said Eli Bremer, a 2008 Olympian in modern pentathlon and a member of Team Integrity\u2019s executive committee. \u201cIn survey after survey, the athletes say that\u2019s the number one benefit they get.\u201d Bremer worries that the SafeSport money will either come out of the training center budget or support to the national governing bodies, who would likely end up cutting their own athlete programs. \u201c[The lawmakers] didn\u2019t think through the consequence of this,\u201d Bremer said. Speaking last week on the ESPN\u2019s Outside the Lines, Blumenthal said athletes will not bear the brunt of the costs. \u201cThat will not and should not happen,\u201d the senator said. \u201cThere is plenty of money for athlete training, for facilities, for fields.\u201d Bremer supports previous legislation.

But from whom? Several people and groups \u2013 Hirshland, Deadspin\u2019s Diana Moskovitz and a commission led by former WNBA president Lisa Borders \u2013 want Congress to back up its rhetoric with money. The Blumenthal/Moran report says the Senate wanted to add funding of $1m a year over five years to a February 2018 SafeSport law, but the House stripped it out.

It is hard to argue that this year\u2019s Ajax team should be in any way disadvantaged by Utrecht\u2019s Europa League defeat to Zenit St-Petersburg two years ago, let alone the same team\u2019s abject humbling by Luxembourg\u2019s Differdange way back in the 2013-14 qualifiers. Meanwhile the top four nations, who automatically get four places in the Champions League, immediately start racking up massive bonuses, making them extremely hard to dislodge. Short of switching to knockout competitions with unseeded draws, it is not obvious what Uefa could do to remedy this situation. At least Ajax now know that with one more run to the semi-finals this year the Dutch champions will, almost certainly, finally earn an automatic place in the Champions League group stage \u2013 even if they will have to wait until 2021 to make use of it.",

After they gambled on fresh tyres there was no real opportunity for Red Bull to react; their only hope lay in Max Verstappen making his rubber last and, valiant as his effort was, just trying to stay ahead pushed them over the edge. The Mercedes team principal, Toto Wolff, described Hamilton\u2019s driving as in \u201canother dimension\u201d but notably paid homage to his team\u2019s strategists. With just over 20 laps remaining they might have settled for the safe option of a guaranteed second place with, perhaps, Hamilton able to challenge Verstappen at the death on the tyres he was happy with.

When you have a desperate partner, that\u2019s when you strike the hardest bargain.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b146305d-32c1-4dc9-9f4d-b60ce025264f\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>At 11pm UK time on 31 October the UK would, by default, become a \u201cthird country\u201d in terms of relations with the EU, with no overarching post-Brexit plan in place and no transition period. The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the \u00a339bn divorce payment.</p>\n    <p>The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods.</p>\n    <p>The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports \u2013 making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO \u201cmost favoured nation\u201d rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.<br></p>\n    <p>WTO rules only cover goods \u2013 they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK\u2019s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.<br></p>\n    <p>Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article 24 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to 10 years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article 24 unilaterally \u2013 the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK\u2019s trading relationship.<br></p>\n    <p>The director general of the WTO, Roberto Azev\u00eado, has <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/economics-and-finance/jumping-from-league-one-to-league-three-wto-insiders-scathing-assessments-of-a-wto-brexit\">told Prospect magazine</a> that \u201cin simple factual terms in this scenario, you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the UK and EU where currently there are none\u201d.</p>\n    <p>Until some agreements are in place, a no-deal scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses \u2013 eg the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europe after 31 October if there is no deal. Those arguing for a \u201cmanaged\u201d no deal envisage that a range of smaller, sector-by-sector, bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.</p>\n    <p><b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a></b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Despite warm words from Donald Trump about a trade deal, Summers said: \u201cWe have economic conflict with China and, even on top of that, the deterioration of the pound is going to further complicate the negotiating picture.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe will see it as giving Britain an artificial comparative advantage and make us think about the need to retaliate against Britain, not to welcome Britain with new trade agreements.\u201d</p> \n<p>Even if the two countries could come to an agreement, Summers said, the UK was in a weak negotiating position.</p> \n<p>\u201cBritain has much less to give than Europe as a whole did, therefore less reason for the United States to make concessions,\u201d he said. \u201cYou make more concessions dealing with a wealthy man than you do dealing with a poor man.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/06/brexit-weekly-briefing-election-speculation-sliding-sterling\">Brexit weekly briefing: election speculation and sliding sterling</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Summers\u2019 remarks came as Raab headed to Canada, the US and Mexico to \u201cfire up\u201d talks about trading relationships.</p> \n<p>The foreign secretary said Asian counterparts he met in Thailand last week expressed a \u201cconsistent warmth\u201d for the UK and a \u201cdesire to work more closely with us\u201d.</p> \n<p>The former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith sought to dispute Summers\u2019 warning, saying: \u201cThis is a classic attempt by Larry Summers to use Brexit for domestic point-scoring.</p> \n<p>\u201cForty-five Republican senators have signed a letter to the prime minister pledging to back a trade deal with Britain once we have left the EU.

Without mentioning Donald Trump or Washington\u2019s accusations of currency manipulation, it said: \u201cToday some in America are obsessed with American privilege to the point of destroying international rules and the international system \u2026 These Americans need to wake up!\u201d \u201cThe responsibility of big countries is to provide the world with stability and certainty while creating conditions and opportunities for the common development of all countries,\u201d according to the editorial. \u201cBut some people in the United States do just the opposite,\u201d it said. On Monday, the US labelled China a currency manipulator, in a move that brings already tense relations to a boil. The US treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, accused China of manipulating its currency \u201cto gain unfair competitive advantage in international trade\u201d. The US will now ask the International Monetary Fund to \u201celiminate the unfair competitive advantage created by China\u2019s latest actions\u201d. It is the first such move since 1994 and came as international stock markets fell on fears of an escalation in the simmering conflict between the two trading superpowers. The Dow Jones index lost close to 3% on Monday following similar falls in Asia and Europe. On Tuesday, Asian markets fell. By the middle of the trading day Australia\u2019s ASX200 had fallen 2%, the Hang Seng was down 0.7%, and the Nikkei 0.7%. The move to designate China a currency manipulator fulfils Donald Trump\u2019s election campaign promise: \u201cChina is intent on continuing to receive the hundreds of billions of dollars they have been taking from the US with unfair trade practices and currency manipulation. So one-sided, it should have been stopped many years ago!\u201d he wrote on Twitter. The US action came after China allowed its yuan to weaken past the key seven-per-dollar level on Monday for the first time in more than a decade. In early offshore Asian trading on Tuesday, the yuan fell as low as 7.1397 per dollar, before clawing back most of the losses after China\u2019s central bank said it was selling yuan-denominated bills in Hong Kong, in a move seen as curtailing short-selling of the currency. China\u2019s central bank said the depreciation in its currency was \u201cdue to the effects of unilateralist and trade-protectionist measures and the expectations for tariffs against China\u201d. Beijing later said it would stop buying US agricultural products and would \u201cnot rule out import tariffs on newly purchased US agricultural products\u201d. In another editorial on Tuesday, the People\u2019s Daily blamed the US for creating new obstacles in trade talks: \u201cA drowning man will clutch at a straw, but he should never blame the others for his own awkward situation.\u201d Washington\u2019s currency manipulation claim will inflame a year-long trade war with China . Trump has already attacked Beijing for reneging on what he claims was a promise to buy more agricultural goods from the US, a claim Chinese authorities dispute. The sharp 1.4% drop in the yuan came days after Trump stunned financial markets by vowing to impose 10% tariffs on the remaining $300bn of Chinese imports from 1 September, abruptly breaking a brief ceasefire in a bruising trade war that has disrupted global supply chains and slowed growth. The news knocked the dollar sharply lower and bolstered the price of gold. The treasury department said a statement from the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC) on Monday made clear that Chinese authorities had ample control over the yuan exchange rate. The PBOC said on Monday it would \u201ccontinue to ... take necessary and targeted measures against the positive feedback behaviour that may occur in the foreign exchange market\u201d. The US treasury statement said: \u201cThis is an open acknowledgement by the PBOC that it has extensive experience manipulating its currency and remains prepared to do so on an ongoing basis.\u201d It said China\u2019s actions violated its commitment to refrain from competitive devaluation as part of the Group of 20 industrialised countries. The treasury said it expected China to adhere to those commitments and not target China\u2019s exchange rate for competitive purposes. US law sets out three criteria for identifying manipulation among major trading partners: a material global current account surplus, a significant bilateral trade surplus with the United States, and persistent one-way intervention in foreign exchange markets. After determining a country is a manipulator, the treasury is required to demand special talks aimed at correcting an undervalued currency, with penalties such as exclusion from US government procurement contracts. The US treasury designated Taiwan and South Korea as currency manipulators in 1988, the year that Congress enacted the currency review law. China was last designated a currency manipulator under the Clinton administration in 1994. In May, the treasury refrained from declaring China a currency manipulator based on new, tougher criteria measuring a country\u2019s global current account surplus, along with persistent one-way intervention and a large bilateral trade surplus with the US. In the report, however, the treasury kept China on an enhanced monitoring list due to a \u201cmisalignment and undervaluation of the RMB relative to the dollar\u201d. Also on Tuesday, Beijing also warned that all \u201ccounter measures\u201d were \u201con the table\u201d if the US placed intermediate-range ground missiles in the region. The US defence secretary, Mark Esper, said on Saturday that he was in favour of putting such missiles in Asia soon. Fu Cong, of China\u2019s foreign ministry, warned China\u2019s neighbours, including Japan, South Korea and Australia, not to allow the US deployment in their territory. Fu said: \u201cIf the US deploys missiles in this part of the world, at the doorstep of China, China will be forced to take countermeasures.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Kevin Blake has made another fascinating and provocative contribution to the debate over female jockeys, using <a href=\"https://www.attheraces.com/blogs/kevin-blake\">his AtTheRaces column</a> to evaluate the statistical effect of French racing\u2019s experiment with a weight allowance. Kevin and I differ on how the numbers should be interpreted but at least we now have some numbers to examine, thanks to his hours of work on the subject in recent weeks.</p> \n<p>One headline is that the strike rate for all female jockeys in French Flat racing last year was 9.03%, which is up from 6.6% three years earlier and closing in on the average for all jockeys of 9.59%. That weight allowance, introduced only two years ago, is seemingly close to levelling the playing field.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/05/too-darn-hot-leg-injury-sussex-dewhurst-stakes\">Too Darn Hot suffers career-ending leg injury at Goodwood</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Female jockeys won almost 15% of all French Flat races last year. The equivalent figure in 2016 was 4.63%.</p> \n<p>The outcome seems close to ideal for French racing. Female jockeys are much more visible and the bad old days, when they were constantly marginalised, are disappearing into the past, but the change has not been so dramatic as to provoke vocal resentment from their male rivals.</p> \n<p>Kevin lays a lot of importance on the fact that the female strike rate, while improved, has not quite caught up with the overall average. He says this shows France-Galop made an accurate calculation of what the weight allowance should be to bring about almost-parity, and also that it justifies the previous reluctance of French trainers and owners to use female jockeys. If they can\u2019t get on level terms with a weight allowance, they clearly aren\u2019t as good as men, on average, is his argument as I understand it. He reckons we should be considering a similar allowance in Britain and Ireland in order to ensure a level playing field.</p> \n<p>My problem with this is that, while Kevin has crunched a lot of numbers, none of them can measure the quality of opportunities now being offered to women, or compare it to what the men are offered. Yes, women are getting more rides and more winners, at an improved rate. But are they getting the leg-up on well-fancied, well-handicapped horses as often as men?</p> \n<p>It wouldn\u2019t be easy to measure that but my intuition is that the answer is \u201cno\u201d. We\u2019re talking about a female population of riders so starved of opportunities just three years ago that some kind of revolution was needed. Now they can claim 1.5kg off each mount, will all trainers and owners abandon their former scepticism about female jockeys? I\u2019m betting that a percentage of them have done so, but by no means all.</p> \n<p>In any case, the French experiment continues and it would be rash to imagine the new status quo is now set in stone.

      "bodyText": "Kevin Blake has made another fascinating and provocative contribution to the debate over female jockeys, using his AtTheRaces column to evaluate the statistical effect of French racing\u2019s experiment with a weight allowance. Kevin and I differ on how the numbers should be interpreted but at least we now have some numbers to examine, thanks to his hours of work on the subject in recent weeks. One headline is that the strike rate for all female jockeys in French Flat racing last year was 9.03%, which is up from 6.6% three years earlier and closing in on the average for all jockeys of 9.59%. That weight allowance, introduced only two years ago, is seemingly close to levelling the playing field. Female jockeys won almost 15% of all French Flat races last year. The equivalent figure in 2016 was 4.63%. The outcome seems close to ideal for French racing. Female jockeys are much more visible and the bad old days, when they were constantly marginalised, are disappearing into the past, but the change has not been so dramatic as to provoke vocal resentment from their male rivals. Kevin lays a lot of importance on the fact that the female strike rate, while improved, has not quite caught up with the overall average. He says this shows France-Galop made an accurate calculation of what the weight allowance should be to bring about almost-parity, and also that it justifies the previous reluctance of French trainers and owners to use female jockeys. If they can\u2019t get on level terms with a weight allowance, they clearly aren\u2019t as good as men, on average, is his argument as I understand it. He reckons we should be considering a similar allowance in Britain and Ireland in order to ensure a level playing field. My problem with this is that, while Kevin has crunched a lot of numbers, none of them can measure the quality of opportunities now being offered to women, or compare it to what the men are offered. Yes, women are getting more rides and more winners, at an improved rate. But are they getting the leg-up on well-fancied, well-handicapped horses as often as men? It wouldn\u2019t be easy to measure that but my intuition is that the answer is \u201cno\u201d. We\u2019re talking about a female population of riders so starved of opportunities just three years ago that some kind of revolution was needed. Now they can claim 1.5kg off each mount, will all trainers and owners abandon their former scepticism about female jockeys? I\u2019m betting that a percentage of them have done so, but by no means all. In any case, the French experiment continues and it would be rash to imagine the new status quo is now set in stone. Rather, I think it will continue to develop as new female jockeys feed into the game and find a warmer welcome than their predecessors, while some trainers and owners become late adopters of the female allowance. Tuesday\u2019s best bets Few trainers just now are hotter than Eric Alston, who is five from 10 over the last fortnight and has made it to the winner\u2019s enclosure with his last four runners, all in handicaps.

The passenger, a Spanish sports journalist called Dani Mero\u00f1o Bori, said he and others had been forced to leave the plane using the emergency slides. \u201cPANIC!!! FEAR \u2013 have never been through anything like that before,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cWhat a miracle. The plane we were on from London to Valencia caught fire. We\u2019ve just landed.\u201d In a later tweet, he said: \u201cWe\u2019re trying to get out but nothing\u2019s working!!! We\u2019re trapped but they\u2019re going to open the door!!! We\u2019ve landed in Manises aiport [in Valencia].\u201d After he got off the plane, Mero\u00f1o tweeted: \u201cEveryone\u2019s OK but there were people who had a really rough time. It was a big shock when smoke started to appear when we were flying. Luckily we were close and everything turned out OK. We took a deep breath when we landed.\u201d The journalist complained about a lack of information from staff and said some passengers had been left to reassure others. Gayle Fitzpatrick, from Glasgow, Scotland, who was on holiday with her husband, Stephen, described the moment smoke entered the cabin. She told PA Media: \u201cIt was very scary. The flight was just ending, and with 10 minutes to go, it started descending rapidly as smoke started to fill the cabin. \u201cA detector was going off saying the cabin was filling with smoke \u2026 There were no communications from the crew, who started to wear full oxygen masks and protective fire wear. \u201cEventually they managed to open the emergency doors and told us to go down the chutes. There were fire engines waiting and then we were all ushered into a bus to the airport.\u201d Fitzpatrick claimed passengers had been stuck at the airport for hours \u201cwithout any information at all\u201d. Stephen Fitzpatrick added: \u201cThe pilot made a very sharp downward trajectory , landed the thing, pulled into a sideway and stopped quite suddenly. \u201cWe could see the fire engines scrambling, but were surprised they weren\u2019t already there given the warning time. There was zero communication at any time from the crew.\u201d Once the passengers were clear of the aircraft, Fitzpatrick said it was up to them to organise themselves and they spent nearly five hours in the baggage area. \u201cThere was some very basic presence from the airport, but essentially the passengers were left entirely to their own devices.\u201d He said he was \u201csurprised at how utterly unprepared they were for an emergency\u201d, calling it a \u201creal eye-opener\u201d. In a statement, British Airways said: \u201cFlight BA422 from Heathrow to Valencia experienced a technical issue on its landing approach into Valencia. All our customers were evacuated safely by our crew and met by the airport\u2019s emergency services. \u201cThere were 175 customers on board the flight, with six cabin crew and two pilots. Three customers were taken to hospital as a precaution and have since been discharged. \u201cThe safety of our customers and crew is always our highest priority. In addition to our team on site, other British Airways team members have arrived in Valencia to help our customers and our local airport partners with anything they need.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>It doesn\u2019t take a seasoned political pundit to understand why MPs might be hostile to any change to our democratic process that puts their job security at risk. That\u2019s not because taking a seat in parliament is an easy option: there\u2019s the online abuse and late-night sessions, the regular cross-country travel and the responsibility inherent to the position. And, apart from the very safest of seats, you could be out of a job whenever the next election may come. Nonetheless, serving your country while attempting to put your beliefs into practice is a privilege. The pay, the perks and future job prospects are not to be sniffed at either.</p> <p>Since Jeremy Corbyn became Labour leader back in 2015, few issues have caused as much division within the parliamentary party as the question of trigger ballots. Or is it deselections? Mandatory reselection? It\u2019s impossible to keep up with the terminology. Whatever it\u2019s called, the fundamental question remains the same: should local Labour party members be able to replace their current representative ahead of an election, if they believe there\u2019s someone better for the job?</p> <p>If you, like me, believe in the principles of democracy and participation, then surely the answer is yes. It is not just Corbyn supporters who think this \u2013 trigger ballots aren\u2019t the creation of Corbyn\u2019s Labour, although the process was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/23/labour-members-in-open-revolt-at-union-backed-party-reforms\">slightly streamlined</a> at Labour conference in Liverpool last year.</p> <p>However, those who are opposed rarely make their case as one of personal interest \u2013 although that is surely part of the consideration \u2013 and some of the criticisms raised require careful thought. Some Labour MPs <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/04/trigger-ballots-prove-an-unwelcome-distraction-for-under-fire-labour-mps\">speaking anonymously to this paper</a> were concerned that reselections and trigger ballots would be a distraction from an increasingly likely 2019 general election. They could shift the focus from tackling the Tories to internal Labour politicking, while eating up an incumbent\u2019s resources, energy and time. Where I differ from them is my belief that the solution to these concerns is not to retreat from further democratisation and public engagement \u2013 but to be more ambitious.</p> <p>The biggest flaw in the current process \u2013 one conveniently overlooked by those resisting changes \u2013 is that they don\u2019t go far enough. More radical proposals could solve these problems and many more. Just look to the US and their primary election model. Both open and closed primaries allow the American public to pick who will run as a candidate. The former \u2013 as used in many US states for presidential candidates \u2013 lets all voters pick one party to select a candidate for. The latter requires you to register as a supporter for your chosen party before you\u2019re given a say.</p> <p>The rigid nature of the US electoral cycle ensures primaries aren\u2019t a distraction from elections but are an important part of the democratic process. They encourage the public to invest support in candidates before election day and to scrutinise them and their platforms \u2013 something evidently lacking in our system. It also allows young, fresh faces such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/27/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-who-is-she-democrats-new-york-life-career-policies\">Alexandria Ocasio Cortez</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/21/ilhan-omar-minnesota-trump-the-squad-minneapolis\">Ilhan Omar</a> to emerge, where otherwise they might have been blocked by large party machines.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/29/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-met-greta-thunberg-hope-contagious-climate\">When Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez met Greta Thunberg: 'Hope is contagious'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Despite the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, in reality British prime ministers are still able to call a general election whenever the idea takes their fancy (<a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/theresa-may-snap-general-election-wales-walking-holiday-husband-easter-robert-peston-uk-prime-a7689046.html\">say while walking through the countryside</a>) and, as such, a British version of such a system would need to be modified. Legislation should be passed \u2013 with the buy-in of all parties \u2013 to create a designated primary period in advance of any general election campaign. Candidates would no doubt posture, prepare and engage with communities in advance, but frankly that\u2019s behaviour that should largely be encouraged. \u201cYou\u2019re being too involved in your local community\u201d is hardly an effective criticism.</p> <p>A process such as this would open up those with \u201cjob-for-life\u201d seats \u2013 such as Tom Watson or Jeremy Corbyn or Philip Davies (insert personal bugbear here) \u2013 to be held accountable and scrutinised, while ensuring they don\u2019t forget who they are there to represent. In marginal seats there would be fewer candidates slipping through the net who later appear unfit for office.</p> <p>Requiring those throwing their hat into the ring to have been a party member for a certain period \u2013 say a year \u2013 seems eminently sensible; as does requiring them to be able to demonstrate their views aren\u2019t opposed to the party\u2019s overall ideology and aims. Perhaps a certain number of nominations should be needed from other local members.</p> <p>As for whether primaries should be open or closed, what\u2019s important is that the opportunity to have a say is opened up to as wide a pool as possible. Closed primaries need not only include fully-fledged paid-up party members. Why not \u2013 as is the case in the US \u2013 allow for voters to instead become registered supporters for local primaries, too? Why not make this free \u2013 on a constituency level \u2013 to try to encourage them? If voters like what they see, they may well sign up. A more involved democracy would surely only benefit us all in the long run.</p> <p>Rather than portraying a need to spend time in your community and respond to it as a hindrance or waste of time, this way we can ensure that MPs from all parties remember representation is part of their core purpose. I\u2019d argue that trigger ballots and reselections would help us on this path \u2013 but only by ensuring that every candidate from every party goes through a primary process would we be sure that everyone is on an equal footing, and that no one party is disadvantaged ahead of an election due to internecine struggles.</p> <p>Instead of focusing on Labour, we should discuss a more fundamental change to the way candidates are chosen by all parties, and open up the process. Let\u2019s not allow refreshing our democracy to become a battle between the Labour left and right; there are bigger fights to be had.</p> <p>\u2022 Michael Segalov is a contributing editor at <a href=\"http://www.huckmagazine.com/\">Huck magazine</a>, a freelance journalist and <a href=\"https://www.laurenceking.com/product/resist/\">author</a></p>",

That\u2019s not because taking a seat in parliament is an easy option: there\u2019s the online abuse and late-night sessions, the regular cross-country travel and the responsibility inherent to the position. And, apart from the very safest of seats, you could be out of a job whenever the next election may come. Nonetheless, serving your country while attempting to put your beliefs into practice is a privilege. The pay, the perks and future job prospects are not to be sniffed at either. Since Jeremy Corbyn became Labour leader back in 2015, few issues have caused as much division within the parliamentary party as the question of trigger ballots. Or is it deselections? Mandatory reselection? It\u2019s impossible to keep up with the terminology. Whatever it\u2019s called, the fundamental question remains the same: should local Labour party members be able to replace their current representative ahead of an election, if they believe there\u2019s someone better for the job? If you, like me, believe in the principles of democracy and participation, then surely the answer is yes. It is not just Corbyn supporters who think this \u2013 trigger ballots aren\u2019t the creation of Corbyn\u2019s Labour, although the process was slightly streamlined at Labour conference in Liverpool last year. However, those who are opposed rarely make their case as one of personal interest \u2013 although that is surely part of the consideration \u2013 and some of the criticisms raised require careful thought. Some Labour MPs speaking anonymously to this paper were concerned that reselections and trigger ballots would be a distraction from an increasingly likely 2019 general election. They could shift the focus from tackling the Tories to internal Labour politicking, while eating up an incumbent\u2019s resources, energy and time. Where I differ from them is my belief that the solution to these concerns is not to retreat from further democratisation and public engagement \u2013 but to be more ambitious. The biggest flaw in the current process \u2013 one conveniently overlooked by those resisting changes \u2013 is that they don\u2019t go far enough. More radical proposals could solve these problems and many more. Just look to the US and their primary election model. Both open and closed primaries allow the American public to pick who will run as a candidate. The former \u2013 as used in many US states for presidential candidates \u2013 lets all voters pick one party to select a candidate for. The latter requires you to register as a supporter for your chosen party before you\u2019re given a say. The rigid nature of the US electoral cycle ensures primaries aren\u2019t a distraction from elections but are an important part of the democratic process. They encourage the public to invest support in candidates before election day and to scrutinise them and their platforms \u2013 something evidently lacking in our system. It also allows young, fresh faces such as Alexandria Ocasio Cortez and Ilhan Omar to emerge, where otherwise they might have been blocked by large party machines. Despite the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, in reality British prime ministers are still able to call a general election whenever the idea takes their fancy (say while walking through the countryside) and, as such, a British version of such a system would need to be modified. Legislation should be passed \u2013 with the buy-in of all parties \u2013 to create a designated primary period in advance of any general election campaign. Candidates would no doubt posture, prepare and engage with communities in advance, but frankly that\u2019s behaviour that should largely be encouraged. \u201cYou\u2019re being too involved in your local community\u201d is hardly an effective criticism. A process such as this would open up those with \u201cjob-for-life\u201d seats \u2013 such as Tom Watson or Jeremy Corbyn or Philip Davies (insert personal bugbear here) \u2013 to be held accountable and scrutinised, while ensuring they don\u2019t forget who they are there to represent. In marginal seats there would be fewer candidates slipping through the net who later appear unfit for office. Requiring those throwing their hat into the ring to have been a party member for a certain period \u2013 say a year \u2013 seems eminently sensible; as does requiring them to be able to demonstrate their views aren\u2019t opposed to the party\u2019s overall ideology and aims. Perhaps a certain number of nominations should be needed from other local members. As for whether primaries should be open or closed, what\u2019s important is that the opportunity to have a say is opened up to as wide a pool as possible. Closed primaries need not only include fully-fledged paid-up party members. Why not \u2013 as is the case in the US \u2013 allow for voters to instead become registered supporters for local primaries, too? Why not make this free \u2013 on a constituency level \u2013 to try to encourage them? If voters like what they see, they may well sign up. A more involved democracy would surely only benefit us all in the long run. Rather than portraying a need to spend time in your community and respond to it as a hindrance or waste of time, this way we can ensure that MPs from all parties remember representation is part of their core purpose. I\u2019d argue that trigger ballots and reselections would help us on this path \u2013 but only by ensuring that every candidate from every party goes through a primary process would we be sure that everyone is on an equal footing, and that no one party is disadvantaged ahead of an election due to internecine struggles. Instead of focusing on Labour, we should discuss a more fundamental change to the way candidates are chosen by all parties, and open up the process. Let\u2019s not allow refreshing our democracy to become a battle between the Labour left and right; there are bigger fights to be had. \u2022 Michael Segalov is a contributing editor at Huck magazine, a freelance journalist and author",

The pair were born five miles apart from each other in the Parisian suburbs and arrived in Newcastle with a similar rap sheet. Ben Arfa, of course, blossomed in the north-east.</p> \n<p>Newcastle is a place where an outsider can come to feel loved, but it is also a working-class city \u2013 flashiness off the pitch must be earned on it \u2013 and it was heartening to see Saint-Maximin ditched his trademark Gucci headband (often seen last season while playing for Nice) for a plain black one at his Newcastle unveiling.

Being a Geordie manager is both a blessing and a curse for Bruce. The Newcastle fans regard the 58-year-old as one of their own \u2013 indeed he used to crawl under the turnstiles to sneak into St James\u2019 Park as a boy \u2013 but he will also feel the criticism of the supporters that more keenly, if things do take a turn for the worse, just as John Carver, Alan Shearer and Kevin Keegan (in his second spell) did.</p> \n<p>Bruce has brought in Jetro Willems on loan to add some much-needed pace to his defence, which continues to be ably lead by Jamaal Lascelles alongside Fabian Sch\u00e4r and Florian Lejeune. In midfield, the promising Sean Longstaff is still recovering from the knee ligament injury that curtailed his breakthrough season, which means there might be room for his teenage brother, Matthew, who has shone during pre-season.

He needs to understand that he needs to work, to make sacrifices, to suffer. And sadly, he has not yet understood that.\u201d Parallels can be drawn between Saint-Maximin and Hatem Ben Arfa. The pair were born five miles apart from each other in the Parisian suburbs and arrived in Newcastle with a similar rap sheet. Ben Arfa, of course, blossomed in the north-east. Newcastle is a place where an outsider can come to feel loved, but it is also a working-class city \u2013 flashiness off the pitch must be earned on it \u2013 and it was heartening to see Saint-Maximin ditched his trademark Gucci headband (often seen last season while playing for Nice) for a plain black one at his Newcastle unveiling. Both Saint-Maximin and Joelinton have been given six-year contracts, the longest at Newcastle since Alan Pardew and his backroom staff were all handed eight-year deals in 2012. Bruce \u2013 a lifelong Newcastle fan \u2013 has only been awarded an initial three-year deal, but was given a warm reception at St James\u2019 Park before a 2-1 friendly win over Saint-\u00c9tienne on Saturday. Being a Geordie manager is both a blessing and a curse for Bruce. The Newcastle fans regard the 58-year-old as one of their own \u2013 indeed he used to crawl under the turnstiles to sneak into St James\u2019 Park as a boy \u2013 but he will also feel the criticism of the supporters that more keenly, if things do take a turn for the worse, just as John Carver, Alan Shearer and Kevin Keegan (in his second spell) did. Bruce has brought in Jetro Willems on loan to add some much-needed pace to his defence, which continues to be ably lead by Jamaal Lascelles alongside Fabian Sch\u00e4r and Florian Lejeune. In midfield, the promising Sean Longstaff is still recovering from the knee ligament injury that curtailed his breakthrough season, which means there might be room for his teenage brother, Matthew, who has shone during pre-season. Elsewhere, it is a squad high on quantity but low on outstanding quality. Until then, much depends on Joelinton, who has \u201clearned the history\u201d of the No 9 shirt that he has been given, and all the expectation that that brings. Newcastle fans famously serenaded another Brazilian forward in the 1980s (to the tune of Do the Conga) \u2013 \u201cWe\u2019ve got Mirandinha, he\u2019s not from Argentina, he\u2019s from Brazil, he\u2019s fucking brill\u201d \u2013 and Joelinton will be hoping for a chant of his own, perhaps riffing on a Dolly Parton number. Newcastle\u2019s fans certainly need something positive to sing about.",

      "body": "<p>Sound massage? Sounds like woo-woo to me. I have been to a gong bath before, lying at the back of a sweaty studio for an hour, confused in the dark while a yogi fingered a large gong. It was a pleasant soundscape, but nothing more. I\u2019d only gone because the event description promised participants would be wrapped in a carpet at the end, which sounded amazing; when it came to it, we were told to cover our legs with a blanket in shavasana (AKA corpse pose) if we were chilly. I had pictured someone rolling me up like a cigarillo \u2013 not something a grown man can request with any dignity. I didn\u2019t go back.</p> <p>Only fair to give it another go, this time one-on-one. Michelle Cade, the founder of <a href=\"https://www.mindlikewaterwellbeing.com/book-online\" title=\"\">Mind Like Water</a> (\u00a390 for 90 minutes) leads various sound therapies, and today I\u2019m experiencing it with a full-body ayurvedic massage. I clamber on to the table, ungainly, clammy, full of unrelated anxieties. Luckily, Cade is an innately soothing presence. She is also a composer of <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/sleep-newzzz/201810/how-can-binaural-beats-help-you-sleep-better\" title=\"\">binaural beats</a>, and describes brain entrainment to me; the theory by which brainwaves supposedly align with the frequency of a supplied beat.

      "bodyText": "Sound massage? Sounds like woo-woo to me. I have been to a gong bath before, lying at the back of a sweaty studio for an hour, confused in the dark while a yogi fingered a large gong. It was a pleasant soundscape, but nothing more. I\u2019d only gone because the event description promised participants would be wrapped in a carpet at the end, which sounded amazing; when it came to it, we were told to cover our legs with a blanket in shavasana (AKA corpse pose) if we were chilly. I had pictured someone rolling me up like a cigarillo \u2013 not something a grown man can request with any dignity. I didn\u2019t go back. Only fair to give it another go, this time one-on-one. Michelle Cade, the founder of Mind Like Water (\u00a390 for 90 minutes) leads various sound therapies, and today I\u2019m experiencing it with a full-body ayurvedic massage. I clamber on to the table, ungainly, clammy, full of unrelated anxieties. Luckily, Cade is an innately soothing presence. She is also a composer of binaural beats, and describes brain entrainment to me; the theory by which brainwaves supposedly align with the frequency of a supplied beat. This allows you to shift your brainwaves to, say, a frequency associated with a meditative state. A nicer way of putting it than \u201cgetting mashed to a trippy jam\u201d. I like jam.

Presumably rich beleaguered stepmothers. As a stepmother I know from experience it\u2019s a tough gig, but recent studies have also revealed that statistically stepmothers are the most vulnerable member of a \u201cblended family\u201d. The stepmother\u2019s opinion is considered <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/stepmonster/201106/why-its-easier-love-stepfather-stepmother\" title=\"\">the least important</a>. Which is why I love doing standup comedy because it\u2019s all my opinion and it is VERY important.</p> <p>Important, but not expensive \u2013 an hour of my advice will set you back just \u00a310 for my aptly titled show Mother \u2013 and here I offer the wisdom built up over 12 years to you for free. You should feel very privileged to read it as I\u2019ve had to take time away from my castle, talking to my enchanted mirror.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If you have a difference of opinion, work it out when the kid isn\u2019t around. And then realise that I am right</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <h2>Do<br></h2> <p>Coin your own terms for your family situation. \u201cBlended family\u201d is the new go-to phrase and I am not mad about it. It makes us sound like we\u2019re a smoothie. I suppose it\u2019s better than the alternative which evokes tins of Spam \u2026 RECONSTITUTED family. In 2019 it is totally fine to say \u201cour family\u201d, most families are complicated and no one assumes you mean 2.4 children any more. I like to call us a unit. Because we are tight-knit and you wouldn\u2019t want to fight us outside a pub. Stepmothers are often called \u201cnon bios\u201d which I also detest; I\u2019m not a washing powder. But if you want to go that route, technically I\u2019m less irritating and safer for all the family.</p> <h2>Don\u2019t<br></h2> <p>Force your stepchild to call you \u201cmother\u201d or \u201cmum\u201d no matter how young they are when you come into their life. They have a mum and you ain\u2019t it. Realise this early doors and save yourself much future pain. My stepson calls me Tiff \u2013 use your name, or even better use mine.</p> <h2>Do<br></h2> <p>Be a friend and a confidant, it\u2019s actually really great for a child to have someone in the family who they can talk to as a friend. Sometimes if they are struggling they will open up to you in a way they won\u2019t with their parents.</p> <h2>Don\u2019t<br></h2> <p>Try to be the mother\u2019s friend. Be kind, be civil, but be honest about the boundaries of your relationship.</p> <h2>Don\u2019t<br></h2> <p>Criticise the mother in front of your stepchild. Ever. Even in the face of wild provocation. If it helps, think of the parent as an extension of the child. If you hurt her, you hurt that child.</p> <h2>Do<br></h2> <p>Make sure your partner backs you when it comes to house rules and boundaries. It\u2019s never helpful if you argue in front of the child about whether the TV should be on during dinnertime. If you have a difference of opinion on these things, work them out when the kid isn\u2019t around. And then realise that I am right.</p> <h2>Do<br></h2> <p>Take pride when your stepchild does well. Especially if you helped them achieve a goal. These are shining jewels in the crown of step-parenting. Also remember you will never be given a crown or any other kind of reward. It\u2019s fine, I already have a crown because I live in a castle with an enchanted mirror, remember? Following on from this \u2026</p> <h2>Don\u2019t<br></h2> <p>Expect any acclaim or thanks from the \u201cbio parent\u201d. (Still hate the washing powder thing either way.) It would be lovely if they occasionally thanked you for actively raising their child, feeding and clothing them but it\u2019s unlikely they will. Also, think how many bio parents hear the phrase: \u201cAm I supposed to be grateful? I DIDN\u2019T ASK TO BE BORN.\u201d I know my own mother hears it from me at least once a week.</p> <h2>Do<br></h2> <p>Find a balance between being the disciplinarian and friend. Kids actually like boundaries, it makes them feel safe.</p> <h2>Do<br></h2> <p>Be clear that the systems and boundaries you put in place may be different to those at Mum\u2019s, but both are equally important and to be respected.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/04/children-are-great-but-they-can-leave-you-skint\">Yes, children are great, but they can leave you skint | Sarah Ditum</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Do<br></h2> <p>Offer incentives. This is a time-honoured parenting tip, and the trick is to establish again that rules are different at yours. For example, sometimes my stepson will do chores for pocket money, such as mowing the lawn or going to the shops. He receives a sense of achievement at getting a job done \u2013 plus a financial reward. You must be clear that these are the rules when he comes to your house. It doesn\u2019t mean that they apply at home with Mum. You don\u2019t want your stepchild to demand a fiver every time he empties the dishwasher there. His mother may not be able to afford to pay him for mowing the lawn. She may not have a lawn. Again this isn\u2019t a problem for me. I have the castle and the grounds, including the haunted maze, which do require a lot of upkeep.</p> <h2>Do<br></h2> <p>Remind them every day that they are wanted, loved and a valuable part of the family. Also that they should behave because the enchanted mirror is watching their every move.</p> <p>\u2022 Tiff Stevenson is a standup comedian and actor.

      "bodyText": "In New York, beleaguered stepmothers are paying $500 per hour to receive stepmother coaching. Presumably rich beleaguered stepmothers. As a stepmother I know from experience it\u2019s a tough gig, but recent studies have also revealed that statistically stepmothers are the most vulnerable member of a \u201cblended family\u201d. The stepmother\u2019s opinion is considered the least important. Which is why I love doing standup comedy because it\u2019s all my opinion and it is VERY important. Important, but not expensive \u2013 an hour of my advice will set you back just \u00a310 for my aptly titled show Mother \u2013 and here I offer the wisdom built up over 12 years to you for free. You should feel very privileged to read it as I\u2019ve had to take time away from my castle, talking to my enchanted mirror. Do Coin your own terms for your family situation. \u201cBlended family\u201d is the new go-to phrase and I am not mad about it. It makes us sound like we\u2019re a smoothie. I suppose it\u2019s better than the alternative which evokes tins of Spam \u2026 RECONSTITUTED family. In 2019 it is totally fine to say \u201cour family\u201d, most families are complicated and no one assumes you mean 2.4 children any more. I like to call us a unit. Because we are tight-knit and you wouldn\u2019t want to fight us outside a pub. Stepmothers are often called \u201cnon bios\u201d which I also detest; I\u2019m not a washing powder. But if you want to go that route, technically I\u2019m less irritating and safer for all the family. Don\u2019t Force your stepchild to call you \u201cmother\u201d or \u201cmum\u201d no matter how young they are when you come into their life. They have a mum and you ain\u2019t it. Realise this early doors and save yourself much future pain. My stepson calls me Tiff \u2013 use your name, or even better use mine. Do Be a friend and a confidant, it\u2019s actually really great for a child to have someone in the family who they can talk to as a friend. Sometimes if they are struggling they will open up to you in a way they won\u2019t with their parents. Don\u2019t Try to be the mother\u2019s friend. Be kind, be civil, but be honest about the boundaries of your relationship. Don\u2019t Criticise the mother in front of your stepchild. Ever. Even in the face of wild provocation. If it helps, think of the parent as an extension of the child. If you hurt her, you hurt that child. Do Make sure your partner backs you when it comes to house rules and boundaries. It\u2019s never helpful if you argue in front of the child about whether the TV should be on during dinnertime. If you have a difference of opinion on these things, work them out when the kid isn\u2019t around. And then realise that I am right. Do Take pride when your stepchild does well. Especially if you helped them achieve a goal. These are shining jewels in the crown of step-parenting. Also remember you will never be given a crown or any other kind of reward. It\u2019s fine, I already have a crown because I live in a castle with an enchanted mirror, remember? Following on from this \u2026 Don\u2019t Expect any acclaim or thanks from the \u201cbio parent\u201d. (Still hate the washing powder thing either way.) It would be lovely if they occasionally thanked you for actively raising their child, feeding and clothing them but it\u2019s unlikely they will. Also, think how many bio parents hear the phrase: \u201cAm I supposed to be grateful? I DIDN\u2019T ASK TO BE BORN.\u201d I know my own mother hears it from me at least once a week. Do Find a balance between being the disciplinarian and friend. Kids actually like boundaries, it makes them feel safe. Do Be clear that the systems and boundaries you put in place may be different to those at Mum\u2019s, but both are equally important and to be respected. Do Offer incentives. This is a time-honoured parenting tip, and the trick is to establish again that rules are different at yours. For example, sometimes my stepson will do chores for pocket money, such as mowing the lawn or going to the shops. He receives a sense of achievement at getting a job done \u2013 plus a financial reward. You must be clear that these are the rules when he comes to your house. It doesn\u2019t mean that they apply at home with Mum. You don\u2019t want your stepchild to demand a fiver every time he empties the dishwasher there. His mother may not be able to afford to pay him for mowing the lawn. She may not have a lawn. Again this isn\u2019t a problem for me. I have the castle and the grounds, including the haunted maze, which do require a lot of upkeep. Do Remind them every day that they are wanted, loved and a valuable part of the family. Also that they should behave because the enchanted mirror is watching their every move. \u2022 Tiff Stevenson is a standup comedian and actor.

      "body": "<p>In a frequently quoted passage, the American professor of medicine <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/22/mindfulness-jon-kabat-zinn-depression-trump-grenfell\" title=\"\">Jon Kabat-Zinn</a> defines mindfulness as \u201ca way of being in a wise and purposeful relationship with one\u2019s experience\u2026 cultivated by systematically exercising one\u2019s capacity for paying attention, on purpose, in the present moment and non-judgmentally\u201d. It sounds harmless enough. But San Francisco-based academic Ronald Purser thinks not. He has written a strident polemic attacking the secular mindfulness movement.</p> <p>Forty years ago, Kabat-Zinn set about distilling Buddhist wisdom into a framework that could address modern concerns. He originally designed a short course for people suffering from chronic physical pain. These programmes have since been extended to treat a wide range of cases including depression, addiction and workplace stress. They have been adopted in schools, businesses, criminal justice systems, in the US military, the NHS and UK parliament. Unless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, you are likely to have encountered them.</p> <p>Critics of secular mindfulness often argue that it is influenced by Buddhism either too much or not enough. Purser, an ordained Korean Zen teacher, holds the latter view. He regrets that, as mindfulness has grown in popularity, it has been extracted from its Buddhist roots, turned into a product and debased.</p> <p>According to <em>McMindfulness</em>, there are more than 100,000 books on Amazon with \u201cmindfulness\u201d or something similar in the title. The movement has sprouted mindful surfing, mindful bread and mindful KFC chicken pot pies. Mindfulness apps have become big business, and Purser notes that there is a \u201cpeculiar irony in turning to an app to de-stress from problems that are often made worse by staring at phones\u201d. As he points out, these superficial, gamified versions of mindfulness are a pale imitation of the real thing.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Purser\u2019s amusingly crotchety account of corporate mindfulness depicts a vapid subsector of the wellness industry</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Purser\u2019s critique cuts deeper. He thinks that mindfulness has not just been diluted and commodified by the market \u2013 it is also itself deepening harmful free market ideology. As he sees it, mindfulness claims that \u201cthe source of people\u2019s problems is found in their heads\u201d. It thereby distracts from the worldly, societal causes of stress and anxiety. If you are burnt out from overwork, stressed by precarious employment, or anxious for future generations as a result of climate change, the mindfulness diagnosis is, as Purser puts it, that your \u201cthoughts are the culprit, every time!\u201d. The upshot for him is that mindfulness disables any impetus for collective organisation and action \u2013 it implicitly conserves the neoliberal status quo.</p> <p>Purser\u2019s aspiration to address injustices in society is, of course, laudable. But why does mindfulness have to be purposed for these revolutionary ends? A careful reading of Purser\u2019s book suggests that he accepts that mindfulness-based interventions can help someone cope with chronic back pain, reduce the chance of a person with depression killing themselves, or make a vulnerable teenager less reactive. Is it not excessively demanding to ask of a short course in mindfulness that it also address society\u2019s systemic problems?</p> <p>The ethicist Jeff McMahan notes that \u201cwe do not condemn a doctor who treats the victims of a war for failing to devote his efforts instead to eliminating the root causes of war\u201d. In our big, rainbow-coloured world, war doctors, anti-war activists and activist doctors can all contribute. Similarly, we should not condemn mindfulness teachers who treat the bewildered victims of neoliberalism for not also fighting neoliberalism itself. There seems to be scope for both palliative mindfulness and mindful activism to add layers of value.</p> <p>\u201cSome may think I want to drown the baby, never mind throw it out with the bathwater \u2013 I do not\u201d, Purser reassures the reader during his relentless salvo. There is an awful lot of bathwater in the world of mindfulness. Purser\u2019s amusingly crotchety account of corporate mindfulness depicts a particularly vapid subsector of the wellness industry. One detail that stands out is that, according to Purser, the Californian guru Dawa Tarchin Phillips charges $12,000 for one day of corporate mindfulness training. It\u2019s a far cry from the Buddhist custom of teachers giving their time freely.</p> <p>Practitioners seeking an account of mindfulness that is responsive to the kind of criticisms Purser makes should consult Christina Feldman and Willem Kuyken\u2019s new book, <em>Mindfulness: Ancient Wisdom Meets Modern Psychology</em>. Feldman, a leading Buddhist teacher, and Kuyken, a clinical psychologist at Oxford University, are as critical of \u201cMcMindfulness\u201d as Purser.</p> <p>\u201cMindfulness is neither a quick fix nor simple\u2026 it is not about emptying the mind, not thinking, or turning away from experience\u2026 it is not attentional training that can be used for ethically questionable practice,\u201d they write. For Feldman and Kuyken, mindfulness can play a legitimate role in reducing individual suffering and facilitating wholesome action, even if it only makes a neutral or modest impact on the wider world.</p> <p>Philosopher Amia Srinivasan has written that we \u201cshould be guided by both a concern for appreciating the world as it is, and making the world as it ought to be\u201d. Purser makes the first concern an enemy of the second. In the course of his plea for \u201ctruly revolutionary\u201d mindfulness, perhaps inadvertently, he ends up fulminating against evidence-backed interventions that can ease suffering in the here and now.</p> <p><em>This review is from the Observer</em></p> <p>\u2022 <em>McMindfulness: How Mindfulness Became the New Capitalist Spirituality</em> by Ronald Purser is published by Repeater (\u00a310.99).

      "bodyText": "In a frequently quoted passage, the American professor of medicine Jon Kabat-Zinn defines mindfulness as \u201ca way of being in a wise and purposeful relationship with one\u2019s experience\u2026 cultivated by systematically exercising one\u2019s capacity for paying attention, on purpose, in the present moment and non-judgmentally\u201d. It sounds harmless enough. But San Francisco-based academic Ronald Purser thinks not. He has written a strident polemic attacking the secular mindfulness movement. Forty years ago, Kabat-Zinn set about distilling Buddhist wisdom into a framework that could address modern concerns. He originally designed a short course for people suffering from chronic physical pain. These programmes have since been extended to treat a wide range of cases including depression, addiction and workplace stress. They have been adopted in schools, businesses, criminal justice systems, in the US military, the NHS and UK parliament. Unless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, you are likely to have encountered them. Critics of secular mindfulness often argue that it is influenced by Buddhism either too much or not enough. Purser, an ordained Korean Zen teacher, holds the latter view. He regrets that, as mindfulness has grown in popularity, it has been extracted from its Buddhist roots, turned into a product and debased. According to McMindfulness, there are more than 100,000 books on Amazon with \u201cmindfulness\u201d or something similar in the title. The movement has sprouted mindful surfing, mindful bread and mindful KFC chicken pot pies. Mindfulness apps have become big business, and Purser notes that there is a \u201cpeculiar irony in turning to an app to de-stress from problems that are often made worse by staring at phones\u201d. As he points out, these superficial, gamified versions of mindfulness are a pale imitation of the real thing. Purser\u2019s critique cuts deeper. He thinks that mindfulness has not just been diluted and commodified by the market \u2013 it is also itself deepening harmful free market ideology. As he sees it, mindfulness claims that \u201cthe source of people\u2019s problems is found in their heads\u201d. It thereby distracts from the worldly, societal causes of stress and anxiety. If you are burnt out from overwork, stressed by precarious employment, or anxious for future generations as a result of climate change, the mindfulness diagnosis is, as Purser puts it, that your \u201cthoughts are the culprit, every time!\u201d. The upshot for him is that mindfulness disables any impetus for collective organisation and action \u2013 it implicitly conserves the neoliberal status quo. Purser\u2019s aspiration to address injustices in society is, of course, laudable. But why does mindfulness have to be purposed for these revolutionary ends? A careful reading of Purser\u2019s book suggests that he accepts that mindfulness-based interventions can help someone cope with chronic back pain, reduce the chance of a person with depression killing themselves, or make a vulnerable teenager less reactive. Is it not excessively demanding to ask of a short course in mindfulness that it also address society\u2019s systemic problems? The ethicist Jeff McMahan notes that \u201cwe do not condemn a doctor who treats the victims of a war for failing to devote his efforts instead to eliminating the root causes of war\u201d. In our big, rainbow-coloured world, war doctors, anti-war activists and activist doctors can all contribute. Similarly, we should not condemn mindfulness teachers who treat the bewildered victims of neoliberalism for not also fighting neoliberalism itself. There seems to be scope for both palliative mindfulness and mindful activism to add layers of value. \u201cSome may think I want to drown the baby, never mind throw it out with the bathwater \u2013 I do not\u201d, Purser reassures the reader during his relentless salvo. There is an awful lot of bathwater in the world of mindfulness. Purser\u2019s amusingly crotchety account of corporate mindfulness depicts a particularly vapid subsector of the wellness industry. One detail that stands out is that, according to Purser, the Californian guru Dawa Tarchin Phillips charges $12,000 for one day of corporate mindfulness training. It\u2019s a far cry from the Buddhist custom of teachers giving their time freely. Practitioners seeking an account of mindfulness that is responsive to the kind of criticisms Purser makes should consult Christina Feldman and Willem Kuyken\u2019s new book, Mindfulness: Ancient Wisdom Meets Modern Psychology. Feldman, a leading Buddhist teacher, and Kuyken, a clinical psychologist at Oxford University, are as critical of \u201cMcMindfulness\u201d as Purser. \u201cMindfulness is neither a quick fix nor simple\u2026 it is not about emptying the mind, not thinking, or turning away from experience\u2026 it is not attentional training that can be used for ethically questionable practice,\u201d they write. For Feldman and Kuyken, mindfulness can play a legitimate role in reducing individual suffering and facilitating wholesome action, even if it only makes a neutral or modest impact on the wider world. Philosopher Amia Srinivasan has written that we \u201cshould be guided by both a concern for appreciating the world as it is, and making the world as it ought to be\u201d. Purser makes the first concern an enemy of the second. In the course of his plea for \u201ctruly revolutionary\u201d mindfulness, perhaps inadvertently, he ends up fulminating against evidence-backed interventions that can ease suffering in the here and now.

Three-quarters of students are predicted higher grades than they achieve, and only 16% of grades are predicted accurately, according to University College London\u2019s Institute of Education. The Sutton Trust has found that the grades of 1,000 top-performing disadvantaged students are under-predicted each year, making them less likely to apply to competitive universities. The charity says teachers are less likely to identify poorer young people as gifted. James Turner, the Sutton Trust\u2019s CEO, says: \u201cWe would like students to apply after they have received their A-level results. This does away with predicted grades and unconditional offers, and empowers students. They can pick the right course at the right university with a high degree of certainty they are making the right choice.\u201d The idea of applying after results is far from new. A review for the Labour government back in 2004, led by Steven Schwartz, then vice-chancellor of Brunel University, called for the immediate introduction of a post-qualification admissions system. Schwartz concluded that using predicted grades was unfair \u201csince it is based on data which are not reliable, it is not transparent for applicants or institutions, and may present barriers to applicants who lack self confidence\u201d. University leaders succeeded in burying the plan, arguing that it would involve too much disruption for both universities and schools. One obstacle is that academics typically use the gap in teaching during the summer to concentrate on research. Under the suggested new system many would instead be immersed in students\u2019 personal statements. The Universities and Colleges Union, which has been campaigning for a move to PQA since 2015, suggests students should sit A-levels earlier, and universities should push the start of term back to November for first years. The union says applicants should still research their university choices early in the year, making expressions of interest to up to 12 universities in January. But under its model students would apply in the first week of August, after receiving their A-level results, with universities making offers by the end of September. Chris Ince, chair of the Association of University Administrators and registrar at London Metropolitan University, says that while there are strong arguments for PQA \u201cthe changes that would be required in universities and also in secondary education are really quite challenging. It would need incredibly strong political will to push this through and I doubt whether that is there.\u201d Nick Hillman, chief executive of the Higher Education Policy Institute thinktank, accepts that a change to the system is fraught with challenges but says the use of \u201cconditional-unconditional\u201d is manipulating students. \u201cThis is someone who isn\u2019t even an adult yet making a life-transforming decision, and universities are applying pressure,\u201d he says. \u201cThat just doesn\u2019t feel right to me. I want young people to follow their hearts.\u201d Meanwhile Green, whose daughter is waiting for A-level results next week, says that the predicted grades system is hugely stressful for students and \u201cwholly outdated\u201d. He says: \u201cWhen results come in next Thursday the newspapers will be full of pictures of delighted students who have got three A*s. But they forget there are people who are deeply anxious because they are so worried about not making their grades.\u201d Green says many young people start basing their lives around their prospective university long before they go. \u201cA slip in grades can seem like a disaster and lead to trauma, which is all too real.\u201d",

He has unleashed immigration officers to engage in mass sweeps of immigrant neighborhoods in search of anyone who might lack documentation \u2013 often nabbing and detaining US citizens in the process.

Some victims <a href=\"https://www.gq.com/story/el-paso-undocumented-hospital\">were hesitant to seek medical care</a> because they feared Trump\u2019s crackdown on immigration status.</p> <p>In the immediate reporting and analyses, some explored the role of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/aug/04/mass-shootings-el-paso-texas-dayton-ohio-8chan-far-right-website\">notoriously open discussion forum, 8Chan</a>, which has hosted discussions, declarations and plans for numerous such racially motivated attacks. The suspect had posted a long message to the forum outlining his justifications and plans. Others noted that the Trump campaign has since February run <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?active_status=all&amp;ad_type=political_and_issue_ads&amp;country=US&amp;impression_search_field=has_impressions_lifetime&amp;q=Donald%20J.%20Trump%20invasion\">a series of advertisements on Facebook that warn of an \u201cinvasion\u201d </a>and declare, against all evidence and with clear malice, that border crossings constitute a threat to the safety of Americans. And, of course, <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/fox-news-laura-ingraham-anti-immigrant-supercut_n_5c88bf80e4b0450ddae58e8b\">Fox News has played a role in stoking the fear of immigrants</a> that some have used to justify violence.</p> <p>It\u2019s hard in the heat of the moment, in the face of so much suffering and horror, to look at the entire ecosystem that fosters and encourages such thought and action. But we must. There are no simple, straightforward causes for this phenomenon. There is no simple \u201csolution\u201d. There is not one distinct medium to blame.</p> <p>As scholars Joan Donovan of the Shorenstein Center at Harvard and Jesse Daniel of the City University of New York have explained, <a href=\"https://journalistsresource.org/tip-sheets/white-supremacy-alt-right-wing-tips/\">white nationalists are savvy about how they work our dynamic, interconnected media ecosystem</a>. Sometimes the terrorists seem more savvy than the journalists who write about them.</p> <p>When they post screeds on forums such as 8Chan, <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/how-media-coverage-contributes-to-white-supremacist-rhetoric\">white nationalists intend for police and journalists to quote directly from them and spread their messages farther than they could themselves.</a> Their claims and terms of choice leap from the dark recesses of small, discrete groups into wider circulation.</p> <p>Coverage and quotes echo around mainstream news reports, then get recirculated even farther and revised into vernacular commentary via amateur posts to Twitter, WhatsApp and Facebook. Facebook\u2019s algorithms are designed to amplify content that generates strong emotions \u2013 and thus user reactions. Racist violence and the commentary about it tend to do just that. So everyone\u2019s Facebook News Feed fills up with news clips, videos (doctored or not), commentary, jokes and angry expressions.</p> <p>As individuals add their own perspectives, reaction to these events can then gel into new forms and new expressions via Facebook and Twitter. What rises on Twitter tends to echo on Facebook and vice versa. Soon images and messages are bouncing back and forth, getting picked up by cable news, newspapers and news sites, Twitter users, Facebook users, WhatsApp users and YouTube contributors. Every player in this complex ecosystem enhances, amplifies and changes the story and the message. That media effect, as much as the corpses, inspires these attacks. Like with all terrorism, the spectacle is the reward.</p> <p>Add to all of that the power of Facebook advertising. Trump\u2019s campaign in 2020, like in 2016, will depend on the ability to run hundreds or thousands of different versions of advertisements, carefully tested and targeted at slim tranches of the potential electorate. Some messages might motivate those otherwise unaccustomed to voting. Others might demotivate someone who would otherwise vote for Trump\u2019s opponent. Facebook\u2019s constant surveillance of us empowers this system, ensuring that most of these ads run beneath public scrutiny. No one sees them except the intended mark.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Trump must consider the deaths of so many innocent people to be a price worth paying for his own power</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The fact that so many of Trump\u2019s Facebook advertisements overtly appeal to white nationalism should disgust us. It should also alarm those who run Facebook.

      "bodyText": "\u201cHow do you stop these people? You can\u2019t,\u201d Donald Trump said at a rally in Florida in May. The response from someone in the crowd came immediately: \u201cShoot them.\u201d The audience laughed and cheered. Trump smirked and made a joke about it. \u201cThem\u201d meant Latino immigrants and refugees that day. \u201cThem,\u201d to those who take Trump\u2019s permission to spread hatred boldly and openly, has at times in the past two years meant Jews, Muslims, Sikhs, Hindus and anyone who stands against the white nationalist agenda. Since 16 June 2015, the day he rode an escalator down to the lobby of Trump Tower to tell a gathering of paid attendants that he would run for president, he declared that we should fear immigrants from Mexico because they rape, Trump has made fear of immigrants \u2013 and those who might look like immigrants \u2013 the central theme of his campaigns and his administrative priorities. Regardless of his tweets and speeches, his actions have inspired and emboldened violent bigots. Trump has gleefully imprisoned migrant children, illegally separating from their families. He has unleashed immigration officers to engage in mass sweeps of immigrant neighborhoods in search of anyone who might lack documentation \u2013 often nabbing and detaining US citizens in the process. He has denied legal immigrants such as those seeking asylum the opportunity to enter the country to make their case. And he has directed racist insults at his elected critics (not coincidentally, women) intended to question their loyalty to the United States. And, of course, Trump first entered the political arena by spreading racist lies about President Barack Obama\u2019s citizenship and place of birth. On Saturday a Trump supporter, motivated by a fear that white people were losing control of everything in the United States, was arrested. Police said the suspect opened fire in a department store in El Paso, Texas. Twenty-two people died and 27 more were injured. Most of the victims were Latino. Some were immigrants. Some victims were hesitant to seek medical care because they feared Trump\u2019s crackdown on immigration status. In the immediate reporting and analyses, some explored the role of the notoriously open discussion forum, 8Chan, which has hosted discussions, declarations and plans for numerous such racially motivated attacks. The suspect had posted a long message to the forum outlining his justifications and plans. Others noted that the Trump campaign has since February run a series of advertisements on Facebook that warn of an \u201cinvasion\u201d and declare, against all evidence and with clear malice, that border crossings constitute a threat to the safety of Americans. And, of course, Fox News has played a role in stoking the fear of immigrants that some have used to justify violence. It\u2019s hard in the heat of the moment, in the face of so much suffering and horror, to look at the entire ecosystem that fosters and encourages such thought and action. But we must. There are no simple, straightforward causes for this phenomenon. There is no simple \u201csolution\u201d. There is not one distinct medium to blame. As scholars Joan Donovan of the Shorenstein Center at Harvard and Jesse Daniel of the City University of New York have explained, white nationalists are savvy about how they work our dynamic, interconnected media ecosystem. Sometimes the terrorists seem more savvy than the journalists who write about them. When they post screeds on forums such as 8Chan, white nationalists intend for police and journalists to quote directly from them and spread their messages farther than they could themselves. Their claims and terms of choice leap from the dark recesses of small, discrete groups into wider circulation. Coverage and quotes echo around mainstream news reports, then get recirculated even farther and revised into vernacular commentary via amateur posts to Twitter, WhatsApp and Facebook. Facebook\u2019s algorithms are designed to amplify content that generates strong emotions \u2013 and thus user reactions. Racist violence and the commentary about it tend to do just that. So everyone\u2019s Facebook News Feed fills up with news clips, videos (doctored or not), commentary, jokes and angry expressions. As individuals add their own perspectives, reaction to these events can then gel into new forms and new expressions via Facebook and Twitter. What rises on Twitter tends to echo on Facebook and vice versa. Soon images and messages are bouncing back and forth, getting picked up by cable news, newspapers and news sites, Twitter users, Facebook users, WhatsApp users and YouTube contributors. Every player in this complex ecosystem enhances, amplifies and changes the story and the message. That media effect, as much as the corpses, inspires these attacks. Like with all terrorism, the spectacle is the reward. Add to all of that the power of Facebook advertising. Trump\u2019s campaign in 2020, like in 2016, will depend on the ability to run hundreds or thousands of different versions of advertisements, carefully tested and targeted at slim tranches of the potential electorate. Some messages might motivate those otherwise unaccustomed to voting. Others might demotivate someone who would otherwise vote for Trump\u2019s opponent. Facebook\u2019s constant surveillance of us empowers this system, ensuring that most of these ads run beneath public scrutiny. No one sees them except the intended mark. The fact that so many of Trump\u2019s Facebook advertisements overtly appeal to white nationalism should disgust us. It should also alarm those who run Facebook. How they can go to work each day knowing that they directly profit from the spread of ethnic hatred is beyond me. For violent white nationalists (and other propagandists) this is an ideal media system. Their numbers can grow once their messages don\u2019t seem so jarring and outside the bounds of normal conversation. The most dramatic effect of the complex relationship among Trump\u2019s statements, Trump\u2019s policies, Fox News\u2019 fearmongering, mainstream journalism, 8Chan\u2019s collection of misfit manifestos, Twitter obsessions and Facebook commentary, is that the rhetoric of violent white supremacy has become common \u2013 almost normal. And so more people find white nationalism viable, perhaps acceptable. They might be less willing to condemn overt racism. Mainstream journalists and pundits might be more willing to grant racists the benefit of the doubt and take their concerns seriously. More voters might find white nationalism a comfortable world view, one that satisfies a once-latent urge to bond only with those like them and blame problems on those unlike them. Trump\u2019s racism is old, established and well documented. And the spike in white nationalist visibility and violence since 2017 is unambiguous. That does not mean Trump wishes slaughter on those he despises. He might even wish he could get away with his statements and policies without having to face the tirades and admonitions that follow each successive incident of racist violence in America. Yet Trump tolerates the sort of violence we saw in El Paso on Saturday. He easily tolerated the violence that engulfed the streets of my town, Charlottesville, Virginia, just eight months after he took office. After each incident in between those two, Trump resumed inflaming racist passions among his followers within days. Trump must consider the deaths of so many innocent people to be a price worth paying for his own power. Over time, the normalization of white nationalism weakens criticism within his own party and attracts many who might otherwise be alienated from a more humane political culture. It also strengthens the resolve of many of his supporters who see their families and identities under threat. Trump\u2019s campaign to retain the White House in 2020 is already distilled into a series of messages about how his supporters should fear people from other places.

Like Rodrigo Duterte in the Philippines, Narendra Modi in India, Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil, Matteo Salvini in Italy, and Viktor Orb\u00e1n in Hungary, Trump has leveraged fear and hatred to drive his extreme nationalism to power. Unless we can forge a strategic global movement to challenge their vision of pure and intolerant nations, the entire world will suffer from more trauma.

It was important that the community had a stake in the process.\u201d The exhibit features 10 screen prints from Andy Warhol\u2019s 1975 series Ladies and Gentlemen, which depicts black and Hispanic drag queens and trans personalities from New York\u2019s Greenwich Village scene, including one portrait of Marsha P Johnson. \u201cIt\u2019s a logical starting point,\u201d said Barilleaux. \u201cThis series is a lead into the show.\u201d There\u2019s also a photo of a model wearing an elegant dress, strutting through a beauty pageant. The photo was taken by Nan Goldin, and it\u2019s a rare early photo taken in the Boston queer club scene in 1972, before her move to New York. \u201cI\u2019m thinking of the TV series Pose, it\u2019s so reminiscent of this era,\u201d said Barilleaux. \u201cArtists have been dealing with these issues since the beginning of time, it\u2019s now we\u2019re seeing them more pronounced in the forefront.\u201d There are stunning photos by Peter Hujar, who photographed countless cultural figures in New York\u2019s downtown art scene in the 1970s and, here, shows black and white portraits of the experimental playwright Ethyl Eichelberger. The exhibit also features self-portraits by Robert Mapplethorpe, one where he\u2019s dressed in drag, as well as a portrait of a lesbian couple by Catherine Opie taken in 1998, the same year she drove across the country photographing lesbian couples in their day-to-day routines. There is also a lithograph by artist Keith Haring, which reads \u201cIgnorance = Fear/Silence = Death,\u201d from 1989. Eva &amp; Adele are showing three works of video art from their Wings series taken in 1997 and 1998, where they walk in unison wearing winged dresses and matching umbrellas. There\u2019s also a life-sized a photo of the duo, so visitors can take their selfie with them. \u201cI\u2019ve been fascinated by their public appearances they make in the art world,\u201d said Barilleaux. \u201cThey manage to get to every art fair and biennial, all over the world. The fact that people get to take their photograph with them is part of their art.\u201d There are works by the Montreal artist JJ Levine, where two people switch their clothing in a pair of mirrored portraits. \u201cIt\u2019s pairs of gender flips based on clothing,\u201d said Barilleaux. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the most popular works in the show.\u201d Viewers can walk through the exhibit to follow a timeline, seeing how trans art has changed. \u201cIt was more hidden with signifiers and coded with connotation, rather than being upfront and transparent like artwork today,\u201d said Barilleaux. \u201cLike in Nan Goldin\u2019s photo, if you didn\u2019t know what drag culture was, you might think it was just another beauty pageant,\u201d he said, \u201cbut now with Ru Paul\u2019s Drag Race and the rise of drag, it\u2019s a whole different world.\u201d Some of the newer works include photos by Mark Seliger, who includes shots of the trans model Hari Nef from his 2016 book, Christopher Street: Transgender Stories, as well as a neon sign, created by Jacolby Satterwhite in 2014, which reads: \u201cHow Lovely Is Me Being As I Am.\u201d There are also self-portraits by the trans Latinx artist Martine Gutierrez, who created a fashion magazine called Indigenous Woman, which is filled with high fashion images of the artist. There\u2019s a wall in the exhibit for people to share their own transition stories, \u201cfrom a birth to a death to their own transition\u201d, said Barilleaux. \u201cWe wanted to broaden it to all kinds of rites of passage and metamorphoses.\u201d In the end, he says this exhibit is essentially about love. \u201cPeople think it\u2019s an LGBTQ show but it\u2019s much broader,\u201d said Barilleaux. \u201cI don\u2019t think of it for only trans or the LGBTQ community but to embrace all communities. We wanted to make it as broad as possible and embrace love within that.\u201d Transamerica/n: Gender, Identity, Appearance Today is now on display at the McNay Art Museum in San Antonio, Texas, until 15 September",

Under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, a vote of no confidence in the government would trigger a two-week scramble to form a new administration. If that quest failed \u2013 as it would \u2013 an election would be triggered. The Electoral Registration and Administration Act 2013 requires 25 working days between the dissolution of parliament and polling day. To squeeze in an election before Brexit day would require a vote of no confidence as soon as the Commons returned; the pre-emptive cancellation of the party conferences; a fortnight of pointless attempts to form an alternative government ending on, say, 17 September; and a snap election held after the minimum five-week campaign on Thursday, 24 October. Johnson wins, and Britain leaves a week later. How likely is it that this precise sequence will fall into place? How often does politics observe such neat patterns? It is more likely, indeed, that 31 October could fall in the middle of an election campaign \u2013 or even (since it is a Thursday) on polling day itself. Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, believes there is no legal impediment to the UK leaving Europe even as rosette-bearing politicians crisscross the nation in battle buses. Already, the pro-remain campaigner Gina Miller is investigating the potential for a judicial review of this grotesque possibility. For how odd would it be for an election about Brexit, triggered by a confidence vote caused by Brexit, and framed by the prime minister\u2019s readiness to embrace a no-deal Brexit, to be made both redundant and ridiculous in real time by Brexit happening anyway, in the thick of electoral battle?

      "bodyText": "The Republicans have a problem. A white supremacist problem. Decades ago they made a crass political calculation to use the Southern Strategy and ride white resentment and patriarchy to untold power and glory. Instead, they ended up with Donald Trump. He is a man who wallows in a white supremacy so virulent and toxic that it has provided the blueprint and the targets for mass murderers. The Republicans\u2019 road to perdition required mastery of coded racist policy language, such as \u201cwelfare queen\u201d, \u201cforced busing\u201d and \u201claw and order\u201d, to lure disaffected white people out of the Democratic party and into the Republican party. The Southern Strategy was so ruthless in its lurch to the right that it actually neutralized the moderates and drove the majority of African Americans out of the party. Yet it turns out that white supremacy can only go so far. In its unvarnished Trumpian form, it has become so repulsive that the Republican base is rapidly shrinking, Senate leadership is facing valid questions about the Republican commitment to US national security as the president cozies up to a nationalist regime in Moscow that launched a \u201csweeping and systematic\u201d cyberattack on the United States, and there have been a slew of retirements by congressional representatives who were rising stars and supposed to be the next generation of the party\u2019s leadership. The party of Lincoln\u2019s electoral cul de sac was mapped out by the Republicans\u2019 contempt for democracy and, especially, fear of the broader American public\u2019s access to the ballot box. Despite numerous warnings about the consequences of doubling down on racism, homophobia and misogyny in an increasingly diverse and liberalizing nation, the Republican party ignored those broadsides and chose, instead, to hollow out, shrink and tilt the electorate as far to the right as possible. \u201cI don\u2019t want everybody to vote,\u201d bellowed Paul Weyrich, the co-founder of the conservative Heritage Foundation. Those marching orders were dutifully supported by a series of supreme court decisions that gutted the Voting Rights Act, sanctioned voter roll purges in defiance of federal law and ignored the racism embedded in extreme partisan gerrymandered districts. As a result, a range of Republican-sponsored voter suppression policies now scars the American landscape in a concerted effort to politically silence the majority of the people. The Brennan Center recently reported that within the past two years, 17 million Americans have been purged from the voter rolls. Worse yet, states that had previously been subject to oversight under the Voting Rights Act, because of proven rampant discrimination, aggressively removed registered voters at a rate \u201c40% higher than the purge rate in jurisdictions that were not covered by Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act\u201d. This, of course, is in addition to the 16 million eliminated from the rolls between 2014-2016. In short, 33 million Americans were just electorally erased. To put this in perspective, that is the equivalent of the combined populations of New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, Philadelphia, San Antonio, San Diego, Phoenix and Dallas, as well as the states of Wyoming, South Dakota, Nebraska, Iowa, and Idaho. Gone. Not surprisingly, these massive removals are error-ridden and concentrated in precincts that tend to have higher minority populations and vote Democratic. Similarly, other voter suppression techniques, such as poll closures, deliberate long lines on election day, voter ID laws and extreme partisan gerrymandering all weigh disproportionately on minorities and urban areas. For the Republican party, it had to be so. As of July 2018, even with all of that purging, there were 12 million more Democrats than Republicans in the United States. Democrats are 40% of registered voters compared with just 29% listed as Republicans. In fact, the percentage of Americans who identified as members of the Republican party dropped by 5% in four short years. And independents lean overwhelmingly toward Democrats. Those sheer numbers and the Republican party\u2019s hardcore refusal to jettison white supremacy as its operating code has led to policy choices that exacerbate the range of crises facing the nation. It\u2019s not just a tax bill that coddled the 1% and threatens the financial stability of the safety net for everyone else. It\u2019s also the way that seemingly race-neutral issues, such as guns, climate change, protecting our elections from foreign interference and ensuring access to quality affordable healthcare, especially for those with pre-existing conditions, carry such a threat to a party whose membership is nearly 90% white and fearful that \u201cthose people\u201d will gain access to \u201cfree stuff\u201d, take their guns and lead the nation down the road to socialism. These concerns might feel patriotic to the party\u2019s adherents, but they are anything but. With moderates neutralized while the nativists are emboldened, the Republican party has intensified an agenda that includes hostility to civil rights, the environment, reproductive rights and the constitutional separation of church and state. And that list of ignominy is coupled with downright cruelty to non-white immigrants. All this hatred has been wrapped in a fig leaf of legality by demolishing Senate rules and confirming nearly 25% of the federal judiciary without any real vetting except a stamp of approval by the Federalist Society. The Republicans, therefore, continue to resort to voter suppression because that kind of policy frame simply cannot resonate with the majority of American voters, who are concerned that there have been more mass shootings (292) than days in the year (216), anxious that 12.5bn tons of Greenland\u2019s ice melted and poured into the ocean in early August alone, angered that in 2016 the Russians hacked the election systems of 50 states to call into question the very legitimacy of the vote and democracy, and furious that refusal to expand Medicaid and provide access to Obamacare has cost more than 15,000 lives. The Republicans\u2019 white supremacist problem is, indeed, lethal. It extends far beyond \u201cthe freak show of the Trump presidency\u201d, however, and threatens to devour not only to the party of Lincoln, which is bad enough, but America itself.

      "bodyText": "The New South Wales health minister, Brad Hazzard, has urged his colleagues to \u201cright a wrong\u201d by supporting an historic bill to decriminalise abortion in the state. Debate on the bill began in the state parliament on Tuesday amid growing pushback from conservative MPs, the Catholic church, and anti-abortion activists who have sought to derail the latest attempt to make NSW the last state to decriminalise abortions. In the lead up to Tuesday\u2019s debate and possible vote, supporters including the 15 co-sponsors of the bill have urged MPs to be on the right side of history, and Hazzard, a key backer of the bill, pressed that theme in his speech to the parliament. \u201cToday, we the people\u2019s representatives here in the NSW parliament have the opportunity to right a wrong enacted into law 119 years ago,\u201d he said. \u201cA law that no one has had the courage since to change. A law that put women\u2019s reproductive rights into the criminal code. A law which was enacted when this place had legislators that were all men.\u201d Based on laws passed in Queensland last year, the Reproductive Health Care Reform Bill would remove abortion from the criminal code and allow for pregnancy terminations up to 22 weeks. After 22 weeks, abortions could still be provided if two doctors \u201cconsider that, in all the circumstances, the termination should be performed\u201d. Debate on the bill could go well into Tuesday night, with opponents expected to table a number of amendments aimed at placing further restrictions on late-term abortions. Hazzard on Tuesday urged colleagues to support the bill, saying further restrictions were not necessary. \u201cOver the past 20 years or so all states and territories across Australia have moved to reform laws on abortion, but not in NSW. Not until now,\u201d Hazzard said. \u201cIn all jurisdictions other than NSW there is [a] statutory recognition that the termination of a pregnancy is a lawful medical procedure. While there is some variation in the criteria applied and the nature and timing of oversight, the starting point in all jurisdictions is to recognise abortion is legal.\u201d While NSW is the last state to decriminalise abortion, other states still maintain elements of it in its criminal code. In South Australia, abortion is legal up to 28 weeks, but only if two doctors agree that a woman\u2019s physical or mental health is endangered by pregnancy, or for serious foetal abnormality. Unlawful abortion remains a crime. \u201cI strongly believe women in NSW are entitled to the same legal provisions that exist across Australia when it comes to having terminations dealt with as a medical and health care practice rather than through a criminal lens,\u201d Hazzard said. Since the bill was introduced into the state\u2019s parliament by the independent MP for Sydney Alex Greenwich last year MPs have been bombarded by both pro-choice and anti-abortion groups. The NSW Pro-Choice Alliance wrote to all MPs urging them to be on the \u201cright side of history\u201d by supporting the bill to end \u201carchaic, cruel and degrading\u201d laws, and there have been daily protests outside the parliament. Dozens of anti-abortion activists holding up signs reading \u201cwomen deserve better than abortion\u201d, \u201cabortion is murder\u201d and \u201cchoose life\u201d, were sandwiched between hundreds of supporters of the bill. Labor\u2019s families spokeswoman Penny Sharpe was among the MPs who addressed the large pro-choice crowd, who held up signs stating \u201cmind your own uterus\u201d and \u201ctrust women\u201d. \u201cWomen in NSW are not criminals for making decisions about their own bodies,\u201d Sharpe said while thanking those who\u2019ve shared stories about abortions, including via the #arrestus online campaign. Sydney\u2019s Catholic Archbishop Anthony Fisher and Anglican Archbishop Glenn Davis wrote an open letter on Monday declaring NSW was \u201con the edge of a precipice\u201d. \u201c[The bill] not only allows for abortion up until 22 weeks for any reason ... it also allows for abortion for any reason even up until birth provided that two doctors agree,\u201d they wrote. In contrast, Uniting Church moderator the Rev Simon Hansford on the weekend backed Greenwich\u2019s abortion bill. \u201cWhen abortion is practised indiscriminately it damages respect for human life,\u201d he wrote in an open letter to parliamentarians. \u201cHowever, we live in a broken world, where people face difficult decisions. Respect for the sacredness of life means advocating for the needs of women as well as every unborn child.\u201d",

The assessment was made after David Frost, the government\u2019s new chief Europe adviser, was said to have sought discussions with Brussels on how negotiations might be reset after the UK crashes out on 31 October. The UK\u2019s failure to provide any proposals on how to deal with the controversial Irish backstop was felt to be significant by EU officials who spoke to the Guardian. Tory MPs have said they will join with Labour to prevent no deal, but Johnson\u2019s senior adviser, Dominic Cummings, believes that instead of resigning if he lost a no-confidence motion, the PM could respond by scheduling a general election for November when Brexit would already have taken place.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, Johnson\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/05/boris-johnson-ushers-in-radical-new-era-of-special-advisers\">new cadre of special advisers</a> present a radical ideological mix.

      "bodyText": "Top story: Plan to flout no-confidence vote Hello, Warren Murray here, with the right amount of news at just the right time. Boris Johnson has no intention of renegotiating the withdrawal agreement and a no-deal Brexit is his \u201ccentral scenario\u201d, European diplomats have been told. The assessment was made after David Frost, the government\u2019s new chief Europe adviser, was said to have sought discussions with Brussels on how negotiations might be reset after the UK crashes out on 31 October. The UK\u2019s failure to provide any proposals on how to deal with the controversial Irish backstop was felt to be significant by EU officials who spoke to the Guardian. Tory MPs have said they will join with Labour to prevent no deal, but Johnson\u2019s senior adviser, Dominic Cummings, believes that instead of resigning if he lost a no-confidence motion, the PM could respond by scheduling a general election for November when Brexit would already have taken place. Meanwhile, Johnson\u2019s new cadre of special advisers present a radical ideological mix. Cummings has been well profiled but you\u2019ve also got Munira Mirza, a Westminster outsider once linked to Marxists but latterly a libertarian and critic of multiculturalism; Chloe Westley, a Vote Leave and TaxPayers\u2019 Alliance veteran and free marketeer; Ross Kempsell, who comes by way of the rightwing GuidoFawkes website; and Danny Kruger, formerly of the Legatum Institute and the Telegraph, who once called for a \u201cperiod of creative destruction in the public services\u201d. * * * Tate attempted murder charge \u2013 A 17-year-old boy has been charged with attempted murder after a six-year-old boy was allegedly thrown from the viewing platform at Tate Modern. The teenager was first arrested on Sunday afternoon at the gallery, after the younger boy was allegedly thrown from the 10th floor, landing on a fifth-floor roof. At last report he was in critical but stable condition in hospital. The accused, who is too young to be named legally, will appear before Bromley youth court today. * * * \u2018Currency manipulator\u2019 \u2013 Financial markets have fallen sharply after Donald Trump accused China of \u201cunfair trade practices and currency manipulation\u201d, in a major flare-up of his trade war against China. In the first such move since 1994, the US Treasury has officially designated China as a currency manipulator, saying it alters the value of the yuan \u201cto gain unfair competitive advantage in international trade\u201d. China has allowed the yuan to weaken past the key seven-per-dollar level for the first time in more than a decade, blaming \u201cthe effects of unilateralist and trade-protectionist measures and the expectations for tariffs against China\u201d. An editorial in the Communist party\u2019s People\u2019s Daily newspaper accused the US of \u201cdestroying international rules and the international system \u2026 These Americans need to wake up!\u201d * * * Sibera blast sparks evacuation \u2013 This video shows the moment a Siberian arms dump blew up, killing at least one soldier, injuring seven more and sending shrapnel flying. Thousands of local residents were evacuated from nearby neighbourhoods. An estimated 40,000 tank and artillery shells are kept on the base in Achinsk, a Siberian city that lies near the Trans-Siberian railroad, 2,000 miles east of Moscow. The Russian defence ministry said the storage site that exploded held gunpowder charges for artillery shells. * * * \u2018Third Reich\u2019 \u2013 Donald Trump has been condemned for using Nazi-era rhetoric after declaring that gun reform should be linked to immigration reform. In an address the US president went out of his way to blame anything but lack of gun control for America\u2019s latest mass shootings. Separately he wrote: \u201cRepublicans and Democrats must come together and get strong background checks, perhaps marrying this legislation with desperately needed immigration reform.\u201d The Democratic presidential hopeful Beto O\u2019Rourke, from of El Paso, responded: \u201cThe only modern western democracy that I can think of that said anything close to this is the Third Reich, Nazi Germany.\u201d David Smith, our Washington bureau chief, writes that Republicans have become too cowed to call Trump out on such occasions. The hatemongering website 8chan which glorified the shootings has been kicked offline by a succession of web hosts. * * * \u2018Die like cockroaches\u2019 \u2013 Brazil\u2019s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, has said he hopes criminals will \u201cdie in the streets like cockroaches\u201d if he can bring in legislation to shield security forces and citizens who shoot alleged offenders from prosecution. Activists fear it could cause a bloodbath but Bolsonaro argued Brazilian police were fighting an \u201cunequal\u201d battle against crime and should not be taken to court. In the first six months of this year Rio police reportedly killed 881 people \u2013 or one person every five hours. Last year Brazilian police killed nearly 6,200 people. \u201cThese are abhorrent comments,\u201d said Ariel de Castro Alves, a human rights activist and lawyer, who argues Bolsonaro\u2019s truculent and dehumanising discourse has already caused a spike in deadly police violence \u2013 largely against poor, young, black men. * * * Get out to the theatre \u2013 After that lot we could do with a breath of fresh air. Here\u2019s our pick of non-London venues for outdoor summer shows, from Cornwall\u2019s coastal Minack to Glasgow\u2019s wooded Greenbank Garden. Today in Focus podcast: What Google knows about you Alex Hern explains how Google\u2019s use of personal data has potentially helped create a new age of mass surveillance. Plus Lois Beckett on the response to two mass shootings in the US. Lunchtime read: \u2018It would be catastrophic\u2019 Boris Johnson was on the steps of Bute House (the Edinburgh residence of the Scottish first minister) with Nicola Sturgeon, and condescendingly extended one of his arms with a view to escorting her inside. She appeared to say something, whereupon the arm went down and Johnson awkwardly followed her in. \u201cI abhor what he is trying to do to the UK,\u201d Sturgeon tells John Harris. \u201cAnd I abhor what the implications of that are for Scotland. So I don\u2019t think it will be surprising to anyone to hear me say that I wasn\u2019t absolutely thrilled to be welcoming Boris Johnson as prime minister.\u201d \u201cHe talks about Brexit, and a no-deal Brexit in particular, as if there is nothing to worry about, and anyone who says there is just being pessimistic and downbeat. I was very frank with him that I think it would be catastrophic, if it were allowed to happen.\u201d The SNP leader is also \u201cno great fan of Jeremy Corbyn. I think his lack of leadership on Brexit in particular \u2026 well, if we do crash out without a deal, he will bear almost as much responsibility as Theresa May or Boris Johnson. I can\u2019t see the SNP going into formal coalition with Labour \u2026 But some kind of progressive alliance that could lock the Tories out of government \u2026 it wouldn\u2019t be a blank-cheque type scenario. We would want Jeremy Corbyn to take a very firm anti-Brexit position. We would look to do what was right for Scotland.\u201d Sport Joe Root says England must avoid making \u201cshotgun\u201d decisions after their crushing defeat by Australia in the Ashes opener, a result that left the hosts with red faces after years of neglecting Test cricket. The Belgian cyclist Bjorg Lambrecht has died after crashing at the Tour of Poland. Jamie George is enjoying one of the most successful periods of his career but the England hooker insists international rugby and the cauldron of a World Cup will require a step up. Derby County have held talks with the former England captain Wayne Rooney over a potential player-coach role. Harry Maguire has become the most expensive defender in the world and the \u00a380m signing looks to be the right fit for Manchester United, writes Jonathan Wilson, even if the deal should have been pushed through earlier in the summer. Today marks the start of the final Kia Super League which, after four years as the premier domestic women\u2019s cricket competition in England, will be replaced next season by the Women\u2019s Hundred. And the Miami Marlins have said sorry after their official Twitter account blamed their cross-state rivals, the Tampa Bay Rays, for the death of TV presenter Steve Irwin. Business Asian stocks have followed Wall Street lower after China let its currency sink and halted purchases of US farm goods, fuelling fears Beijing\u2019s trade war with Donald Trump will harm the global economy. China\u2019s main index lost 2.5% and Tokyo fell 2%. Markets in Hong Kong, Sydney and Seoul also retreated.

      "bodyText": "\u201cMy name is Clive Palmer, your honour, and I appear for myself, the fourth defendant.\u201d An hour before making this statement, the billionaire Clive Frederick Palmer told reporters outside the Queensland supreme court he had a \u201cmoral responsibility\u201d to fight the $200m claim by the liquidators of Queensland Nickel, his Townsville business that collapsed in 2016. \u201cPeople all across Australia are having trouble now with liquidators and receivers, businesses are closing ... because of their unconscionable behaviour,\u201d Palmer huffed. \u201cSo when that happens to someone like me, I\u2019ve got a moral responsibility not to give up. That\u2019s what I\u2019m doing. It is the greater good.\u201d For three years, Palmer has consistently denied responsibility for QNI\u2019s string of debts \u2013 including entitlements for workers and payments to other creditors \u2013 even as court evidence mounted that, as the business faltered, he had dispersed more than $170m from the company\u2019s accounts. Palmer once listed his hobby as litigation and is renowned for his legal tactics to prolong legal action and rack up costs for opponents. His companies had hired a coterie of solicitors, barristers and experts. But Palmer also sat at the bar table, representing himself and appearing to revel in the spectacle, holding court in the courtroom. On Queensland Nickel, Palmer, the fourth defendant, appeared to have made it clear in any number of ways that he wasn\u2019t the settling kind. And then, on the first day of the third week of the trial, he settled. Transactions of the \u2018most extraordinary kind\u2019 After Queensland Nickel collapsed, liquidators pored over its books and learned dozens of questionable payments had been made from its accounts; payments which appeared to have no logical link to the operation of the business. Most of the money went to Palmer, his family or his other corporate interests. Liquidators later alleged in court that the billionaire used the company as his \u201cpersonal piggy bank\u201d. There was the $8m payment to his father-in-law, Alexander Sokolov. A mysterious woman in Kyrgyzstan was sent $1m. A $15m payment from Queensland Nickel\u2019s accounts went to Palmer\u2019s personal bank account in Hong Kong; and another $15m was sent to French Polynesia, as operational finance for a former Club Med resort in Bora Bora, which Palmer had bought to become a personal retreat. None of the payments were disputed. Liquidators alleged Palmer acted as a \u201cshadow director\u201d of QNI. Part of Palmer\u2019s defence was that the complex corporate structure effectively allowed him to authorise the payments. Queensland Nickel operated the Yabulu refinery at Townsville. The failed company was a joint venture between two others \u2013 QNI Metals and QNI Resources \u2013 both owned by Palmer. He chaired a \u201cjoint venture owners\u2019 committee\u201d as the sole owner of both ventures. In September 2016, as court hearings began, Palmer produced a \u201clittle green book\u201d , a leather-bound 2001 diary that he claimed to have found in a drawer in 2009 and subsequently used to make notes, in pencil, varying the joint venture agreement. At the opening of the trial, Shane Doyle, who represented the liquidators, said he intended to demonstrate the entries were falsified. The scrawled notes purportedly gave Palmer the power to order QNI to make political donations or \u201cany matter or thing requested or required by Clive Palmer\u201d, including investing in Palmer companies. The court heard that by the time of its closure Queensland Nickel was losing $5m a month. Doyle told the court that, after Palmer knew that the company was going into administration, and that workers at the refinery would lose their jobs, he had QNI buy $230m in shares in two other Palmer companies, essentially putting those entities at the front of any creditors\u2019 queue. \u201cThey are transactions of the most extraordinary kind,\u201d Doyle told the court. \u2018I don\u2019t owe them any money\u2019 At the heart of the collapse of Queensland Nickel, and the subsequent court case, has always been the workers; about 800 in total were made redundant when the business closed. The federal government, under its fair entitlements guarantee, paid out $66m of about $73m in entitlements owing to workers. It then sought a special purpose liquidator to investigate the events leading to the closure of the refinery, and to attempt to recover unpaid money. Palmer has consistently denied he owed anything to the workers. He most famously repeated that claim in a fiery interview with Leigh Sales on ABC\u2019s 7.30 in 2018. \u201cI don\u2019t owe them any money, that\u2019s the reality of it,\u201d Palmer said at the time. He argued that administrators refused to allow a plan that would have paid creditors in 2016 and transferred the refinery\u2019s workers to a separate corporate entity. Liquidators described that claim as \u201cscandalous, defamatory and grossly misleading\u201d. For three years, legal proceedings were frequently marked with such bluster and bitterness. Two judges recused themselves from the supreme court case, both after Palmer made applications suggesting bias. The second of those, Justice David Jackson, accused Palmer of \u201cscandalising conduct\u201d. Doyle alleged during proceedings that it had become clear that \u201cMr Palmer will manipulate events to defeat (the actions by liquidators) by whatever means are at his disposal\u201d. In 2o17, while being questioned on the whereabouts of his nephew, the fugitive former QNI director Clive Mensink, Palmer turned up to a court hearing with a sick bag, breathing apparatus and a pillow. He told the court he was taking medication that caused memory loss. Palmer dropped out of the Forbes list of the 50 richest Australians, left federal parliament and wound up the first version of his political vehicle, the Palmer United party. There were times when the liquidators privately questioned whether they would find any money after the melodrama. It continued on the eve of the trial, as Palmer applied to delay proceedings. His insolvency expert, Peter Dinoris, backed out of the hearing, citing ill health. Palmer eventually found a replacement who, it transpired during the second week of the hearing, had gone to South America. \u201cIt turns out he\u2019s actually in Brazil on Friday and can\u2019t actually see us,\u201d Christopher Ward, representing Palmer\u2019s companies, told the court. Palmer: I\u2019m vindicated Palmer has returned to the Forbes rich list, after a bounce in resources prices and a huge 2017 court win in a royalties dispute with the Chinese firm Citic, an estranged joint venture partner on a Pilbara iron ore project. The ruling re-energised Palmer. The yellow political billboards returned, amid a $60m advertising spend for his United Australia party across 18 months before the federal election. He now says he wants to reopen the refinery, and in April set up a $7m trust to cover payments owed to workers, which were above the capped amounts for the federal scheme. Some have still not been paid, refusing to sign an accompanying gag clause. The settlement announced on Monday, understood to total $110m, involves repaying the federal government for the entitlements it has already paid, \u201call other outstanding employee entitlements, and a full recovery for the majority of unsecured creditors\u201d. A small number of debt claims against Palmer\u2019s flagship company, Mineralogy, remain in dispute and before the courts. Special purpose liquidator Stephen Parbery of KPMG said settlement negotiations began after \u201cthe full weight of evidence was laid before the defendants\u201d. Palmer, not famous for critical self-reflection, claimed the settlement of the debts had left him \u201cvindicated\u201d. \u201cToday\u2019s settlement confirms the actions against me were nothing more than a witch-hunt designed to smear my good reputation,\u201d Palmer said.",

      "body": "<p>On a frigid evening in January, Dr Katie McHugh welcomed 20 guests into her Indianapolis home and prepared to tell them a secret she had kept for seven years. They had come for a Planned Parenthood fundraiser party; among them were her father and two sisters. As they gathered in her living room, sipping wine, McHugh\u2019s hands shook.</p> <p>\u201cI was quite nervous, but I wanted to get my secret out as soon as I could,\u201d she says. \u201cI said, \u2018Welcome.

She had never told her conservative-leaning parents or three sisters, despite them being an unusually tight family. Nor had she told her two young children, neighbors, or colleagues at the university where she works as a professor of clinical obstetrics and gynecology.</p> <p>\u201cI knew it would cause angst in my community and potentially increase risk to my family,\u201d she says. \u201cI worried that certain relatives would be ashamed of me.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/24/abortion-wars-alabama-12-hours-besieged-clinic\">On the frontline: 12 hours in a besieged abortion clinic</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Despite living in the proverbial closet, McHugh had been receiving hate mail from anti-choicers since April 2016, when she published an <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/04/01/indianas-new-abortion-law-wont-save-babies-it-will-only-make-my-patients-suffer/?utm_term=.a94c9fcc3b44\">op-ed in </a><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/04/01/indianas-new-abortion-law-wont-save-babies-it-will-only-make-my-patients-suffer/?utm_term=.a94c9fcc3b44\">the Washington Post</a> arguing against new legislative restrictions on abortion in Indiana.

Letters admonishing her that \u201cabortion is murder\u201d arrived at her office in Indianapolis. Her Twitter and Facebook inboxes flooded with messages saying she should get raped or murdered.</p> <p>The harassment she endured after simply advocating for reproductive rights confirmed her belief that it was safer to keep quiet \u2013 to let people keep assuming that she \u201cjust liked to talk about abortion\u201d but didn\u2019t actually provide it herself.</p> <p>That changed this past winter, when she was the target of another wave of vitriol on social media. This time, the hate mail came not from strangers, but from people she knew. Outraged that she had posted about reproductive rights in a Facebook group, conservative acquaintances banned her from the group and told her that she didn\u2019t deserve to be a doctor, that they would never refer to her practice again.</p> <p>\u201cIt was the only response I\u2019ve gotten that really upset me,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten consistent hate mail from my local peers since then.\u201d</p> <p>Instead of pushing her into deeper silence, this harassment provoked her to come out of the closet.</p> <p>\u201cI thought, \u2018This is ridiculous.\u2019 I\u2019m playing into this game by being quiet and secretive.

Knowing that protesters sometimes go through clinics\u2019 garbage, she had all her paychecks and other mail from the clinic sent to her parents\u2019 house in Philadelphia.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want anyone to know my address,\u201d Bass says.</p> <p>She set up security cameras at her house, even though her neighborhood had \u201czero crime\u201d. When she gave guest lectures to Oklahoma University\u2019s Medical Students for Choice group, on such subjects as \u201chow to use a manual vacuum aspirator\u201d, she insisted that the lectures be listed as \u201ctaught by an anonymous doctor\u201d.</p> <p>Her car was listed in the name of her husband, a member of the military, so that if a protester at the clinic looked up her license plate, \u201cthey\u2019d get this military guy\u201d, she says. \u201cThe backup plan was that if any protesters ever came to our home, we\u2019d move to the military base and be protected by giant tanks.\u201d</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t just the wrath of anti-choice activists that concerned Bass. She also worried that disclosing her part-time involvement in abortion care would get her fired from her full-time job as a family medicine physician.</p> <p>\u201cThe CEO of the health center where I worked was extremely anti-choice,\u201d she says. \u201cI was nervous that if he found out, I wouldn\u2019t be able to do family medicine any more.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe problem of employment discrimination is enormous for doctors who want to perform abortion healthcare,\u201d says Noel Leon, a lawyer at the National Women\u2019s Law Center. \u201cI have talked to dozens of clinicians who have faced \u2013 or who fear \u2013 dire employment consequences when they have disclosed their commitment to abortion access.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b94633cf0bdb28154c7877165726aaacc39ca49b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b94633cf0bdb28154c7877165726aaacc39ca49b/0_0_3000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dr Rathika Nimalendran works as an abortion provider at a health clinic in North Carolina.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"800\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dr Rathika Nimalendran works as an abortion provider at a health clinic in North Carolina.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeremy M Lange/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A 2018 <a href=\"https://nwlc-ciw49tixgw5lbab.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/ProviderDiscrimReport2018.pdf\">report</a> authored by Leon, who provides legal support to doctors who perform abortions, offers the disconcerting example of a doctor who was threatened by a senior partner of a private OB/GYN practice during a job interview: \u201cIf I ever find out you did elective abortion any time in your professional life, you\u2019ll never practice medicine in [this state] again. Do you understand that?\u201d the partner said.</p> <p>Such discrimination is particularly harsh at Catholic-owned or affiliated hospitals, which make up <a href=\"http://static1.1.sqspcdn.com/static/f/816571/27061007/1465224862580/MW_Update-2016-MiscarrOfMedicine-report.pdf?token=cHO2jBYG017RabAXAdQXC4c9rps%3D\">14.5%</a> of all acute-care hospitals in the United States, and which often explicitly prohibit their doctors from performing abortions in their off hours, even at unaffiliated clinics. Since many abortion clinics are staffed primarily by part-time employees, these restrictions can lead to staffing shortages where providers are needed most. In some cases, a doctor\u2019s ability to keep helping women is contingent on whether she keeps quiet about it.</p> <p>Dr Rathika Nimalendran, who drives by a giant Confederate flag every morning on her way to her full-time job at a family health clinic in rural North Carolina, keeps the fact that she moonlights as an abortion provider a secret from her mostly conservative Christian patients.</p> <p>\u201cI feel like I\u2019m two different people,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I grew up in a south Asian family in Florida, so I\u2019m used to the idea of code-switching. As a woman of color, I feel doubly careful. A few of my patients have made comments about my gender and ethnicity.\u201d Sharing her commitment to abortion access could invite further scrutiny and jeopardize her work at the family clinic.</p> <p>Last September, tired of staying quiet, Bass moved from Oklahoma back to her hometown of Philadelphia, where she talks openly with friends and family about working in abortion care.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m still in the process of coming out,\u201d she says. \u201cComing out on social media is the hardest.

But then she moved to a town in \u201cthe buckle of the Bible Belt in the south\u201d, she says. \u201cWe had a lot of anxiety about the impact it could have on my husband\u2019s job if it became known that I\u2019m a provider.\u201d</p> <p>She has now lived for 16 years hiding her part-time work as a provider at Planned Parenthood from all but her immediate family and a handful of friends. When people ask what she does, she answers vaguely, saying she works at a \u201cmultistate women\u2019s healthcare organization\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI truly believe I\u2019m making the world a better place by helping women have bodily autonomy,\u201d she says. \u201cIt sucks to have to hide what I do.\u201d</p> <p>She came out to her closest friends only after knowing them for years. \u201cI\u2019ve been terrified every time I\u2019ve done it,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I\u2019ve been met with nothing but love [and] gratitude, actually, for what I do. If I could be confident that that would be everyone\u2019s response, I would be more open.\u201d</p> <p>When it comes to anti-abortion acquaintances, she says, \u201cit would never occur to them that I might be a provider, because I\u2019m fun and friendly, and they have this idea that providers are demons\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"81459061ee3a59e8258e35e30cfa34e923bff8c5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/81459061ee3a59e8258e35e30cfa34e923bff8c5/0_0_2593_1777/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pro-choice supporters protest in front of the Alabama state house as the state senate votes on the strictest anti-abortion bill in the US.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"685\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pro-choice supporters protest in front of the Alabama state house as the state senate votes on the strictest anti-abortion bill in the US.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Aluka Berry/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As Roe v Wade <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/04/new-york-sees-significant-rise-in-women-traveling-across-state-line-for-abortions\">hangs in the balance</a>, pro-choice advocates now fear a day when all abortion providers are once again forced underground.

In recent months, she has taken steps to break her silence, getting involved in more advocacy work: along with McHugh, Nimalendran, Marchin, and Bass, she is a 2019 fellow at Physicians for Reproductive Health, a not-for-profit organization offering doctors advocacy training such as the <a href=\"https://prh.org/leadership-training-academy/\">Leadership Training Academy</a>.</p> <p>\u201cMy rage is overcoming my anxiety,\u201d Farris says. \u201cThis legislation is going to tear women\u2019s lives apart. I can\u2019t stay silent in the face of it. It feels a bit scary to be open. But it\u2019s been exhausting to keep such an important part of my life a secret. I can\u2019t imagine that what will come in the future will be more exhausting.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Scared, but proud</strong></h2> <p>Since coming out to friends and family at her Planned Parenthood fundraiser, McHugh has started talking about her work \u201call the time\u201d, she says.</p> <p>On the 10th anniversary, in June, of Dr George Tiller\u2019s murder at the hands of an anti-abortion extremist in his church, she <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KtMcH/status/1134811700086157312\">tweeted</a>: \u201cBeing an #abortion provider can be scary, intimidating, and challenging but it is some of the most fulfilling work I do. This would not be possible if not for the work of the giants before me, like Dr. Tiller. #AbortionIsHealthcare and I am #Proud2Provide.\u201d</p> <p>After this announcement, many of her local colleagues vowed to stop referring patients to her family medicine practice. Extended family members stopped talking to her and her husband. She was not surprised.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to change their minds and they\u2019re not going to change mine,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m okay with that. It\u2019s their choice.

      "bodyText": "On a frigid evening in January, Dr Katie McHugh welcomed 20 guests into her Indianapolis home and prepared to tell them a secret she had kept for seven years. They had come for a Planned Parenthood fundraiser party; among them were her father and two sisters. As they gathered in her living room, sipping wine, McHugh\u2019s hands shook. \u201cI was quite nervous, but I wanted to get my secret out as soon as I could,\u201d she says. \u201cI said, \u2018Welcome. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re all here. I\u2019m Katie McHugh. I\u2019m an OB-GYN here in Indianapolis, and I\u2019m also an abortion provider.\u2019 My father visibly flinched. Then I stopped to take a breath, and everyone applauded, including my family.\u201d After the event, to her surprise, her Republican father donated to Planned Parenthood. \u201cHe gave me this big hug and said, \u2018I\u2019m so proud of you, but I\u2019m worried about you.\u2019\u201d Until that night, McHugh had told no one but her husband and a few close friends about her part-time work as an abortion provider at one of nine abortion clinics in Indiana. She had never told her conservative-leaning parents or three sisters, despite them being an unusually tight family. Nor had she told her two young children, neighbors, or colleagues at the university where she works as a professor of clinical obstetrics and gynecology. \u201cI knew it would cause angst in my community and potentially increase risk to my family,\u201d she says. \u201cI worried that certain relatives would be ashamed of me.\u201d Despite living in the proverbial closet, McHugh had been receiving hate mail from anti-choicers since April 2016, when she published an op-ed in the Washington Post arguing against new legislative restrictions on abortion in Indiana. (She identified herself in the op-ed as an obstetrician-gynecologist, but did not mention that she herself moonlights as a provider.) Letters admonishing her that \u201cabortion is murder\u201d arrived at her office in Indianapolis. Her Twitter and Facebook inboxes flooded with messages saying she should get raped or murdered. The harassment she endured after simply advocating for reproductive rights confirmed her belief that it was safer to keep quiet \u2013 to let people keep assuming that she \u201cjust liked to talk about abortion\u201d but didn\u2019t actually provide it herself. That changed this past winter, when she was the target of another wave of vitriol on social media. This time, the hate mail came not from strangers, but from people she knew. Outraged that she had posted about reproductive rights in a Facebook group, conservative acquaintances banned her from the group and told her that she didn\u2019t deserve to be a doctor, that they would never refer to her practice again. \u201cIt was the only response I\u2019ve gotten that really upset me,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten consistent hate mail from my local peers since then.\u201d Instead of pushing her into deeper silence, this harassment provoked her to come out of the closet. \u201cI thought, \u2018This is ridiculous.\u2019 I\u2019m playing into this game by being quiet and secretive. It makes me feel like I\u2019m ashamed of this work, which I\u2019m not \u2013 I\u2019m actually so deeply proud of it.\u201d McHugh is one of five formerly closeted abortion providers who spoke to the Guardian about their recent decisions to come out about their work. Fed up with mounting threats to reproductive rights \u2013 including a pending abortion ban in Alabama that would punish providers with up to 99 years in prison, a push to close the last clinic in Missouri, and a president who tweets about doctors \u201cexecuting babies\u201d \u2013 these providers are finally breaking their silence about the cause to which they have devoted their lives. Pushed into the closet Before Roe v Wade, the landmark 1973 ruling that enshrined a woman\u2019s right to choose, anyone who helped terminate an unwanted pregnancy was a criminal under US law. Criminalization did not put a stop to abortion, of course \u2013 estimates of the number of illegal abortions in the 1950s and 1960s range from 200,000 to 1.2m per year \u2013 but it did force so-called back-alley providers to perform the procedure under extreme secrecy. Take, for example, the Jane Collective, an underground network of amateur female abortion providers that launched in Chicago in 1965: to avoid being identified, \u201cThe Janes\u201d, as they dubbed themselves, often blindfolded their patients. In 1972, police raided one of the collective\u2019s secret apartments and arrested seven members. While shackled in the police van, the Janes fished the index cards bearing their patients\u2019 names from their pockets, tore them up, and swallowed them. Each was charged with up to 110 years in prison. (The charges were dropped after Roe v Wade passed the following year.) Nearly 50 years later, many providers still feel pressured to operate in secrecy, even when the job \u201cfeels like a calling\u201d, as McHugh puts it. In a 2014 study about abortion stigma, 66% of providers reported difficulties surrounding disclosure. Many fear getting shunned by their communities, fired from their day jobs, or targeted by anti-choice protesters. Death threats, intimidation and harassment have increased drastically at US abortion clinics since Donald Trump\u2019s election, according to the National Abortion Federation. A survey found that, in 2018, nearly half of US abortion clinics experienced at least one incident of severe violence, threats of severe violence and/or severe harassment. Feeling muzzled can take a psychological toll. Dr Angela Marchin, an OB/GYN in Colorado, says that lying by omission to her conservative, midwestern Catholic family about providing abortions made her feel \u201calmost like a fraud\u201d, as if she were leading a double life. \u201cI was one person when I was around my friends and coworkers, then would go home and have to be someone different,\u201d Marchin says. \u201cI almost felt ashamed or guilty about it, like I wasn\u2019t standing up for what I believed in. But I didn\u2019t want to be shunned by my family.\u201d In April, when Texas lawmakers were considering a bill that would allow the death penalty for patients who get abortions, Marchin tweeted her own abortion story. During her first year of medical school, she got pregnant after being unable to pay $70 a month for birth control. Her local Planned Parenthood helped her get a medical abortion. \u201cNow I am an OB/GYN dedicated to helping other women achieve their goals,\u201d she wrote. The tweet went viral. Since then, she has been building up the courage to come out as a provider to her family during an upcoming family vacation. \u201cI\u2019m planning to put my foot down and stand up for what I believe in to my family,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s so important for people to understand how normal and common [abortion] is, especially now, and that I\u2019m not a bad person for doing this. In fact, I\u2019m doing it out of the goodness of my heart and at great risk to myself.\u201d Dire consequences for speaking up While moonlighting at an abortion clinic in Oklahoma City, from 2016 to 2018, Dr Maya Bass used a burner phone to communicate with her patients. Knowing that protesters sometimes go through clinics\u2019 garbage, she had all her paychecks and other mail from the clinic sent to her parents\u2019 house in Philadelphia. \u201cI didn\u2019t want anyone to know my address,\u201d Bass says. She set up security cameras at her house, even though her neighborhood had \u201czero crime\u201d. When she gave guest lectures to Oklahoma University\u2019s Medical Students for Choice group, on such subjects as \u201chow to use a manual vacuum aspirator\u201d, she insisted that the lectures be listed as \u201ctaught by an anonymous doctor\u201d. Her car was listed in the name of her husband, a member of the military, so that if a protester at the clinic looked up her license plate, \u201cthey\u2019d get this military guy\u201d, she says. \u201cThe backup plan was that if any protesters ever came to our home, we\u2019d move to the military base and be protected by giant tanks.\u201d It wasn\u2019t just the wrath of anti-choice activists that concerned Bass. She also worried that disclosing her part-time involvement in abortion care would get her fired from her full-time job as a family medicine physician. \u201cThe CEO of the health center where I worked was extremely anti-choice,\u201d she says. \u201cI was nervous that if he found out, I wouldn\u2019t be able to do family medicine any more.\u201d \u201cThe problem of employment discrimination is enormous for doctors who want to perform abortion healthcare,\u201d says Noel Leon, a lawyer at the National Women\u2019s Law Center. \u201cI have talked to dozens of clinicians who have faced \u2013 or who fear \u2013 dire employment consequences when they have disclosed their commitment to abortion access.\u201d A 2018 report authored by Leon, who provides legal support to doctors who perform abortions, offers the disconcerting example of a doctor who was threatened by a senior partner of a private OB/GYN practice during a job interview: \u201cIf I ever find out you did elective abortion any time in your professional life, you\u2019ll never practice medicine in [this state] again. Do you understand that?\u201d the partner said. Such discrimination is particularly harsh at Catholic-owned or affiliated hospitals, which make up 14.5% of all acute-care hospitals in the United States, and which often explicitly prohibit their doctors from performing abortions in their off hours, even at unaffiliated clinics. Since many abortion clinics are staffed primarily by part-time employees, these restrictions can lead to staffing shortages where providers are needed most. In some cases, a doctor\u2019s ability to keep helping women is contingent on whether she keeps quiet about it. Dr Rathika Nimalendran, who drives by a giant Confederate flag every morning on her way to her full-time job at a family health clinic in rural North Carolina, keeps the fact that she moonlights as an abortion provider a secret from her mostly conservative Christian patients. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m two different people,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I grew up in a south Asian family in Florida, so I\u2019m used to the idea of code-switching. As a woman of color, I feel doubly careful. A few of my patients have made comments about my gender and ethnicity.\u201d Sharing her commitment to abortion access could invite further scrutiny and jeopardize her work at the family clinic. Last September, tired of staying quiet, Bass moved from Oklahoma back to her hometown of Philadelphia, where she talks openly with friends and family about working in abortion care. \u201cI\u2019m still in the process of coming out,\u201d she says. \u201cComing out on social media is the hardest. I keep wondering, if I tweet about reproductive health, is this going to bring protesters to my house?\u201d \u2018It sucks to have to hide what I do\u2019 Dr Katherine Farris, a self-described former \u201cpro-life, Catholic girl\u201d and family physician in North Carolina, long feared that coming out as an abortion provider could impact not just her own career, but her husband\u2019s, too. When she first decided to become a provider, after reading The Story of Jane: The Legendary Underground Feminist Abortion Service, written by a former member of the covert collective, she never expected she would have to maintain some of the secrecy under which the Janes operated. But then she moved to a town in \u201cthe buckle of the Bible Belt in the south\u201d, she says. \u201cWe had a lot of anxiety about the impact it could have on my husband\u2019s job if it became known that I\u2019m a provider.\u201d She has now lived for 16 years hiding her part-time work as a provider at Planned Parenthood from all but her immediate family and a handful of friends. When people ask what she does, she answers vaguely, saying she works at a \u201cmultistate women\u2019s healthcare organization\u201d. \u201cI truly believe I\u2019m making the world a better place by helping women have bodily autonomy,\u201d she says. \u201cIt sucks to have to hide what I do.\u201d She came out to her closest friends only after knowing them for years. \u201cI\u2019ve been terrified every time I\u2019ve done it,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I\u2019ve been met with nothing but love [and] gratitude, actually, for what I do. If I could be confident that that would be everyone\u2019s response, I would be more open.\u201d When it comes to anti-abortion acquaintances, she says, \u201cit would never occur to them that I might be a provider, because I\u2019m fun and friendly, and they have this idea that providers are demons\u201d. As Roe v Wade hangs in the balance, pro-choice advocates now fear a day when all abortion providers are once again forced underground. In the first five months of 2019, 378 abortion restrictions were introduced across the United States. Nine states have now passed laws to outlaw abortion or forbid it past a certain point in pregnancy. So many women in the US lack access to reproductive healthcare that secret networks around the country are now emulating the Janes, discreetly training women to provide safe abortions outside of the law and the medical establishment, hoarding misoprostol and building manual vacuum aspirators from mason jars in their bedrooms. \u201cWe can never go back to that,\u201d Farris says. In recent months, she has taken steps to break her silence, getting involved in more advocacy work: along with McHugh, Nimalendran, Marchin, and Bass, she is a 2019 fellow at Physicians for Reproductive Health, a not-for-profit organization offering doctors advocacy training such as the Leadership Training Academy. \u201cMy rage is overcoming my anxiety,\u201d Farris says. \u201cThis legislation is going to tear women\u2019s lives apart. I can\u2019t stay silent in the face of it. It feels a bit scary to be open. But it\u2019s been exhausting to keep such an important part of my life a secret. I can\u2019t imagine that what will come in the future will be more exhausting.\u201d Scared, but proud Since coming out to friends and family at her Planned Parenthood fundraiser, McHugh has started talking about her work \u201call the time\u201d, she says. On the 10th anniversary, in June, of Dr George Tiller\u2019s murder at the hands of an anti-abortion extremist in his church, she tweeted: \u201cBeing an #abortion provider can be scary, intimidating, and challenging but it is some of the most fulfilling work I do. This would not be possible if not for the work of the giants before me, like Dr. Tiller. #AbortionIsHealthcare and I am #Proud2Provide.\u201d After this announcement, many of her local colleagues vowed to stop referring patients to her family medicine practice. Extended family members stopped talking to her and her husband. She was not surprised. \u201cI\u2019m not going to change their minds and they\u2019re not going to change mine,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m okay with that. It\u2019s their choice. Turns out I\u2019m all about choice.\u201d",

In a second warehouse, tanks emit a low hum as water brought in from precious underground aquifers passes through a six-stage purification process before bottling. \u201cIn Saudi Arabia there are only two sources of water: the sea and deep wells,\u201d says Ahmed Safar Al Asmari, who manages one of Berain\u2019s two factories in Riyadh. \u201cWe\u2019re in the central region, so there are only deep wells here.\u201d Perhaps not surprising for someone who makes a living selling water, Asmari professes to be untroubled about the future of Saudi Arabia\u2019s water supply. \u201cStudies show water in some reserves can stand consumption for another 150 years,\u201d he says. \u201cIn Saudi Arabia, we have many reserves \u2013 we have no problems in this area.\u201d His confident predictions are out of sync with the facts. One Saudi groundwater expert at King Faisal University predicted in 2016 that the kingdom only had another 13 years\u2019 worth of groundwater reserves left. \u201cGroundwater resources of Saudi Arabia are being depleted at a very fast rate,\u201d declared the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation as far back as 2008. \u201cMost water withdrawn comes from fossil deep aquifers, and some predictions suggest that these resources may not last more than about 25 years.\u201d In a country that rarely sees rain, the habit of draining groundwater, like the Berain factory does, could prove perilous: groundwater makes up an estimated 98% of naturally occurring fresh water in Saudi Arabia. Indeed, oil may have built the modern Saudi state, but a lack of water could destroy it if drastic solutions aren\u2019t found soon. The emergency seems invisible in Riyadh, which is undergoing a construction boom as more buildings creep upwards to join a collection of towering skyscrapers. Although everyone knows this city in the desert owes its existence to the discovery of oil in 1938, fewer realise water was just as important. Decades of efforts to make the desert bloom to feed the city\u2019s population have resulted in agricultural projects to grow water-intensive crops such as wheat, on farmland meted out to figures favoured by the royal family. While many question the accuracy of the kingdom\u2019s optimistic estimates of its own oil reserves, the looming threat of a lack of water could prove to be an even bigger problem. Saudi Arabia consumes double the world average of water per person, 263 litres per capita each day and rising, amid a changing climate that will strain water reserves. In March, the Kingdom launched the Qatrah programme to demand citizens drastically cut their water use. Its aim is to ration water to 200 litres per person per day by 2020 and 150 litres by 2030.

Back then there was no internet or email, so Kevin sent me a tape in the post. I put it on my little cassette recorder and out came <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gr-zG-IXDyo\">Big Fun</a>. The version was very basic, just a keyboard line I think, but I listened to the melody and sang whatever came into my head.</p> <p>I flew over to Kevin\u2019s apartment in Detroit and met his friends. It was only later that I realised they were <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt4aQEXqMRw\">Juan Atkins and Derrick May</a>, AKA the \u201cgodfathers of Detroit techno\u201d who were tearing up the dancefloors. Kevin had a mic set up in his living room and I remember him saying: \u201cEverybody be quiet, she\u2019s gonna sing.\u201d And I did Big Fun just like that. It became our first hit.</p> <p>Good Life was the same \u2013 a cassette, then me singing \u2013 but this time we used a studio in Chicago. I\u2019d grown up singing in church and had been a girl scout and a cheerleader, so lyrics about positive thinking and good vibes came naturally. The 80s had been very hard for people: Good Life and Big Fun tapped into a feeling that things were getting better.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJxJxr9RlKM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KJxJxr9RlKM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJxJxr9RlKM\">Watch the video for Good Life</a> from 1988</figcaption> </figure>   <p>When both songs were global hits, I was flying to the record company in London every week, while working at a department store in Chicago. My bosses were brilliant: \u201cTake another day off! This is great!\u201d I didn\u2019t give up the day job until some time after the hits started.</p> <p>We made the Good Life video in London and had a ball. You can see the famous landmarks \u2013 Trafalgar Square, St Paul\u2019s Cathedral, Piccadilly Circus. We\u2019d grab bystanders on the street and ask to film them. At one point we saw a Rolls-Royce parked on the kerb with a uniformed chauffeur standing by it. The director asked the driver: \u201cCould we use your car for a minute?\u201d The idea was that I\u2019d jump into the Rolls-Royce and head for the Good Life. The chauffeur drove me down the street and then parked it back exactly where it had been, all before the owner returned. I often wonder who that car belonged to.

I had bet Derrick $5 that my football team would beat his, but when they did, he wouldn\u2019t pay up, so I punched him in the face. He respected that and it was the start of a long friendship.</p> <p>We bonded because there weren\u2019t many other black people in our school. I became interested in what they were doing with drum machines and synthesisers. Juan had visions of futuristic, funky synthesiser music, a cross between Kraftwerk and George Clinton, and was the first to make <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/apr/30/techno-detroit-music-of-the-future-classic-feature\">what became known as techno</a> under the names <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqiBFqWCTU\">Cybotron</a> and then <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRVb47WtINI\">Model 500</a>. That inspired Derrick, but I\u2019d been to the Paradise Garage in New York and wanted to use Inner City to create Detroit techno, but with a disco feel.</p> <p>Everything started happening for us after Neil Rushton, a British DJ, came to Detroit and featured our music on a compilation album, <a href=\"https://www.discogs.com/Various-Techno-The-New-Dance-Sound-Of-Detroit/release/65112\">Techno! The New Dance Sound of Detroit</a>. When techno hit the UK, I was suddenly playing in clubs like Spectrum or the Hacienda, warehouses or fields at these enormous raves. It was an amazing time: it felt like the world was changing. </p> <p>Thirty years later, Good Life still instantly gets people dancing and feeling good. It\u2019s funny, because there\u2019s not much to it: a <a href=\"https://mixmag.net/feature/909-tracks-using-the-tr-909\">TR-909 drum machine</a> for the beat and a TR-707 for percussion, Casio and Korg keyboards and a sampler. I started with the main riff, imitated it with the bassline, put some strings on it and sent it to Paris. After she added her lyrics, I did a mix and a friend of mine played more keyboards. I wasn\u2019t a trained musician, but I heard notes in my head and found a way of getting them out. I may have been a \u201cgodfather of techno\u201d, but I couldn\u2019t read music.</p> <p>\u2022 New single <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am1eIMvBEI8\">Need Your Love</a> is out now. <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pg/InnerCityDetroit\">Inner City</a> play at <a href=\"https://lostvillagefestival.com/\">Lost Village festival, Lincoln</a>, 23 August.

The 80s had been very hard for people: Good Life and Big Fun tapped into a feeling that things were getting better. When both songs were global hits, I was flying to the record company in London every week, while working at a department store in Chicago. My bosses were brilliant: \u201cTake another day off! This is great!\u201d I didn\u2019t give up the day job until some time after the hits started. We made the Good Life video in London and had a ball. You can see the famous landmarks \u2013 Trafalgar Square, St Paul\u2019s Cathedral, Piccadilly Circus. We\u2019d grab bystanders on the street and ask to film them. At one point we saw a Rolls-Royce parked on the kerb with a uniformed chauffeur standing by it. The director asked the driver: \u201cCould we use your car for a minute?\u201d The idea was that I\u2019d jump into the Rolls-Royce and head for the Good Life. The chauffeur drove me down the street and then parked it back exactly where it had been, all before the owner returned. I often wonder who that car belonged to. Maybe they saw the video and thought: \u201cHey, that vehicle looks familiar !\u201d Kevin Saunderson, producer Juan Atkins, Derrick May and myself met in school in Belleville, Michigan. I had bet Derrick $5 that my football team would beat his, but when they did, he wouldn\u2019t pay up, so I punched him in the face. He respected that and it was the start of a long friendship. We bonded because there weren\u2019t many other black people in our school. I became interested in what they were doing with drum machines and synthesisers. Juan had visions of futuristic, funky synthesiser music, a cross between Kraftwerk and George Clinton, and was the first to make what became known as techno under the names Cybotron and then Model 500. That inspired Derrick, but I\u2019d been to the Paradise Garage in New York and wanted to use Inner City to create Detroit techno, but with a disco feel. Everything started happening for us after Neil Rushton, a British DJ, came to Detroit and featured our music on a compilation album, Techno! The New Dance Sound of Detroit. When techno hit the UK, I was suddenly playing in clubs like Spectrum or the Hacienda, warehouses or fields at these enormous raves. It was an amazing time: it felt like the world was changing. Thirty years later, Good Life still instantly gets people dancing and feeling good. It\u2019s funny, because there\u2019s not much to it: a TR-909 drum machine for the beat and a TR-707 for percussion, Casio and Korg keyboards and a sampler. I started with the main riff, imitated it with the bassline, put some strings on it and sent it to Paris. After she added her lyrics, I did a mix and a friend of mine played more keyboards. I wasn\u2019t a trained musician, but I heard notes in my head and found a way of getting them out. I may have been a \u201cgodfather of techno\u201d, but I couldn\u2019t read music. \u2022 New single Need Your Love is out now. Inner City play at Lost Village festival, Lincoln, 23 August. Then One Day at the Disco, London, and Moovin festival, Compstall, on 24 August.",

The blockbusters they felt confident about releasing in May, June and July have mostly come and gone, save for a few still ravaging the landscape, picking off repeat viewers still lured by the air conditioning. The new movies tend to be mistakes or misfits, gambles that have either come up snake eyes or are shrouded in uncertainty, because they don\u2019t fit into the usual boxes. If one of them turns out to be a late-summer sensation, there will have been no precedent for it, no tried-and-true formula for what constitutes a Hollywood hit.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jul/23/drop-dead-gorgeous-20th-anniversary-dark-comedy\">Drop Dead Gorgeous at 20: how dark pageant comedy works better in 2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>M Night Shyamalan\u2019s The Sixth Sense was \u2013 and remains \u2013 unclassifiable. It\u2019s usually labeled a horror film, and there\u2019s plenty of evidence to support that reading: a moody Philadelphia haunted by unsettled spirits, a few macabre shocks and a long history of cinematic ghost stories like The Innocents and The Haunting, about souls still trapped in a purgatorial no man\u2019s land between the living and the dead. It could also be seen as an American answer to Wim Wenders\u2019 Wings of Desire, with Bruce Willis taking the Bruno Ganz role of an angel observing \u2013 and occasionally interceding in \u2013 the sad, lonely lives of mortals below. Or, to quote Stephen Holden\u2019s pan in the New York Times, it could be dismissed as \u201csupernatural schmaltz\u201d, with a touchy-feely agenda more in line with films like Ghost or Field of Dreams.</p> <p>Whatever the case, The Sixth Sense struck a chord with audiences in August 1999, thanks in part to the most (not) talked-about twist to hit the culture since The Crying Game seven years earlier. It feels great to be able to have that twist in the open now \u2013 <em>Bruce Willis was dead the whole time! And the kid who sees dead people never brought it up for some reason! </em>\u2013 because it gets at why the film moved so many people after giving them a few mild shocks first. Through the story of a nine-year-old who can see and counsel the deceased, Shyamalan taps into the powerful fantasy that we can still control our own narrative, even after death. All the loose ends can be tidied up \u2013 justice granted, relationships mended, a final \u201cgoodnight\u201d uttered \u2013 and everyone can rest in peace, whether they\u2019re six feet under or sleeping next to an empty divot on the bed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e141c04214cb6df864d0e7d4f098ace244124771\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e141c04214cb6df864d0e7d4f098ace244124771/0_0_4645_3104/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Haley Joel Osment as Cole Sear.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Haley Joel Osment as Cole Sear.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ron Phillips/Hollywood/Kobal/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For Shyamalan, it was a last chance to define himself as Steven Spielberg\u2019s heir apparent after stalling out twice with Praying for Anger, his forgotten 1992 directorial debut, and Wide Awake, a Denis Leary/Dana Delany/Rosie O\u2019Donnell dramedy that bombed in 1998 after three years of reshoots, edits and general psychological torment under the Miramax chief Harvey Weinstein. He even had Spielberg\u2019s producing partners, Frank Marshall and Kathleen Kennedy, along for the ride. He never lacked for confidence \u2013 in fact, it was his confidence that reportedly rankled Weinstein \u2013 but The Sixth Sense feels so much like the first M Night Shyamalan film, in style and tone and twistiness, it\u2019s as if his previous work never happened at all. Like a true movie magician, he made his career struggles disappear.</p> <p>The Shyamalan that emerges in The Sixth Sense may resemble Spielberg in his <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq4tMF98CI0\">storyboard pristine</a> imagery, but the real audacity of the film is his commitment to a somber tone, which goes far beyond the moody trappings associated with horror films. He\u2019d carry it over to even greater effect with his 2001 follow-up, Unbreakable, but his overcast Philadelphia is less about creating a frightening atmosphere than imposing a deeper, more melancholy ambience over the action. The look allows Shyamalan to toggle back to chills on occasion, especially during a stretch where ghosts bombard its young hero with nightly visitations, but he wants to suggest the grief, confusion and misgivings associated with death.</p> <p>The performances all fall in line, starting with Bruce Willis as Dr Malcolm Crowe, a celebrated child psychologist who\u2019s nonetheless tormented by the case of a child he couldn\u2019t help.

      "bodyText": "For major studios, August is where the bodies are buried. The blockbusters they felt confident about releasing in May, June and July have mostly come and gone, save for a few still ravaging the landscape, picking off repeat viewers still lured by the air conditioning. The new movies tend to be mistakes or misfits, gambles that have either come up snake eyes or are shrouded in uncertainty, because they don\u2019t fit into the usual boxes. If one of them turns out to be a late-summer sensation, there will have been no precedent for it, no tried-and-true formula for what constitutes a Hollywood hit. M Night Shyamalan\u2019s The Sixth Sense was \u2013 and remains \u2013 unclassifiable. It\u2019s usually labeled a horror film, and there\u2019s plenty of evidence to support that reading: a moody Philadelphia haunted by unsettled spirits, a few macabre shocks and a long history of cinematic ghost stories like The Innocents and The Haunting, about souls still trapped in a purgatorial no man\u2019s land between the living and the dead. It could also be seen as an American answer to Wim Wenders\u2019 Wings of Desire, with Bruce Willis taking the Bruno Ganz role of an angel observing \u2013 and occasionally interceding in \u2013 the sad, lonely lives of mortals below. Or, to quote Stephen Holden\u2019s pan in the New York Times, it could be dismissed as \u201csupernatural schmaltz\u201d, with a touchy-feely agenda more in line with films like Ghost or Field of Dreams. Whatever the case, The Sixth Sense struck a chord with audiences in August 1999, thanks in part to the most (not) talked-about twist to hit the culture since The Crying Game seven years earlier. It feels great to be able to have that twist in the open now \u2013 Bruce Willis was dead the whole time! And the kid who sees dead people never brought it up for some reason! \u2013 because it gets at why the film moved so many people after giving them a few mild shocks first. Through the story of a nine-year-old who can see and counsel the deceased, Shyamalan taps into the powerful fantasy that we can still control our own narrative, even after death. All the loose ends can be tidied up \u2013 justice granted, relationships mended, a final \u201cgoodnight\u201d uttered \u2013 and everyone can rest in peace, whether they\u2019re six feet under or sleeping next to an empty divot on the bed. For Shyamalan, it was a last chance to define himself as Steven Spielberg\u2019s heir apparent after stalling out twice with Praying for Anger, his forgotten 1992 directorial debut, and Wide Awake, a Denis Leary/Dana Delany/Rosie O\u2019Donnell dramedy that bombed in 1998 after three years of reshoots, edits and general psychological torment under the Miramax chief Harvey Weinstein. He even had Spielberg\u2019s producing partners, Frank Marshall and Kathleen Kennedy, along for the ride. He never lacked for confidence \u2013 in fact, it was his confidence that reportedly rankled Weinstein \u2013 but The Sixth Sense feels so much like the first M Night Shyamalan film, in style and tone and twistiness, it\u2019s as if his previous work never happened at all. Like a true movie magician, he made his career struggles disappear. The Shyamalan that emerges in The Sixth Sense may resemble Spielberg in his storyboard pristine imagery, but the real audacity of the film is his commitment to a somber tone, which goes far beyond the moody trappings associated with horror films. He\u2019d carry it over to even greater effect with his 2001 follow-up, Unbreakable, but his overcast Philadelphia is less about creating a frightening atmosphere than imposing a deeper, more melancholy ambience over the action. The look allows Shyamalan to toggle back to chills on occasion, especially during a stretch where ghosts bombard its young hero with nightly visitations, but he wants to suggest the grief, confusion and misgivings associated with death. The performances all fall in line, starting with Bruce Willis as Dr Malcolm Crowe, a celebrated child psychologist who\u2019s nonetheless tormented by the case of a child he couldn\u2019t help. That child has grown up to shoot Malcolm and himself \u2013 the former fatally, we later discover \u2013 but in his despair, Malcolm tries to redeem himself by seeking out another patient with similar symptoms of acute anxiety and mood disorder. That kid is Cole Sear, played by Haley Joel Osment as a preternaturally thoughtful and sensitive boy who lives alone with his mother (Toni Collette), gets bullied by his peers and carries a secret that he\u2019s unwilling to share with Malcolm. (Or the audience.) The Sixth Sense does a lot of cheating with information, barely bothering to establish the physical and psychological limitations of those who are dead and not loving it. (\u201cThey only see what they want to see,\u201d Cole later explains to Malcolm, a line that patches over the plot holes like Silly Putty on drywall.) Nevertheless, it\u2019s fun to return to the film after knowing the twist and seeing how Shyamalan makes us see only what he wants us to see, like wordless scenes between Malcolm and his wife (Olivia Williams) that are made to seem like marital discord or catching Malcolm in what looks like the end of a conversation with another character.

But this growing army of online activists also attract significant numbers of supporters \u2013 footage of the groups\u2019 confrontations with alleged paedophiles, often streamed live on Facebook, are viewed and liked by millions \u2013 who believe they are doing a job the authorities are unwilling or insufficiently resourced to do properly.</p> <p>\u201cWe embrace the vigilante label,\u201d says Oliver Braid, one of the founders of the Scottish Wolf Pack group. \u201cThe response from the public has been overwhelmingly positive, whether that\u2019s at stings or the thousands of messages we get online. People don\u2019t feel the police take this seriously enough. So it\u2019s about keeping children safe but it\u2019s also about building a sense of community.\u201d</p> <p>Stuart Allardyce, the director of the child abuse prevention campaign Stop It Now! Scotland, confirms the increase in hunting activity north of the border, but warns: \u201cWhile many online activist groups are genuinely trying to help, they often fail to consider the risk of harm to their target, as well as their family and friends. Their work can also be counterproductive \u2013 the evidence they supply is often not high enough quality to secure a conviction.\u201d</p> <p>The police take a firm official line on OCAAGs \u2013 the NPCC is clear that \u201cwe do not endorse these groups and will not work with them\u201d, while Police Scotland says: \u201cIt\u2019s understandable that people want to protect children from harm but we would ask them not to take the law into their own hands.\u201d According to the force, nearly 1,600 crimes where an individual communicated with a child for sexual purposes were recorded between April 2018 and February 2019. Police sources also express frustration that these incidents pull resources from high-harm cases to low-grade grooming offences that might not even make it to court.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019ve had police officers shake me by the hand. They know we\u2019re not leaving any time soon.</p> <footer> <cite>Sophie, Child Protectors Scotland</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But the hunting groups say individual police officers are more supportive of their activities. Sophie (not her real name) runs the Child Protectors Scotland team, which has about 30 members, ranging in age from early 20s to 60s. \u201cCertain police forces will work with us, but they\u2019d never admit it. For example, we might call and say we\u2019re planning a sting at a certain time, and they\u2019ll ask us to delay it because they\u2019re busy. I\u2019ve had police officers shake me by the hand. They know we\u2019re not leaving any time soon.\u201d</p> <p>Speaking to a number of Scottish OCAAGs, what is immediately striking is the degree of organisation involved. Wolf Pack decoys, for example, are given a lengthy handbook that includes suggested childlike responses and tips on evidence gathering. They are also instructed never to initiate sexual conversation or arrangements to meet in person.</p> <p>Decoys are trained to talk about school, homework and parents, and to explain their inexperience if a person tries to introduce sexual content to the exchange. They are also taught to move the chat to WhatsApp as quickly as possible so the conversation can be easily retrieved and is encrypted, reducing the chances of mistaken identity.</p> <p>As CiCi explains: \u201cSome will say immediately: \u201cOh, you\u2019re too young,\u2019 and sometimes report you; others continue to talk. I\u2019m always reminding them of my age. When it comes into the sexual chat, I say: \u2018I don\u2019t know anything about that,\u2019 and again the ball is in their court. Some will go right into it, by which I mean graphic details, pictures, videos, links to porn sites, things that kids should not be seeing.\u201d</p> <p>At a face-to-face meeting, the alleged offender will be met by members of the OCAAG, who will immediately make a citizen\u2019s arrest and call the police, livestreaming the incident to the Wolf Pack Hunters UK Facebook page while waiting for the police to attend.</p> <p>It is this practice of filmed confrontation, reminiscent of the US TV show <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/jul/25/usnews.broadcasting\">To Catch </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/jul/25/usnews.broadcasting\">a Predator</a>, which originally ran from 2004 to 2008, that is most controversial.

He adds that \u201cdespite the events being portrayed negatively in the media, we have had overwhelming support from the people of Armadale\u201d. The man who was hounded out of his home later pleaded guilty to a grooming charge.</p> <p>Interviews with those involved in OCAAGs reveal a strong belief that sexual abuse of children, particularly online grooming, is not being taken seriously enough by the authorities. But their motivation also stems from a deeper personal motivation. \u201cAlmost everybody in the group has direct personal experience of abuse,\u201d one member said.</p> <p>Group members also insist that stings are only the most visible part of their activities, which include internet safety advice to worried parents, support to individuals disclosing historical abuse for the first time, and a gathering place for people who feel their concerns about children\u2019s safety are not being heard elsewhere.</p> <p>CiCi, who has acted as a decoy on about 20 stings, is hopeful that her work is starting to alert those in authority to what she sees as an epidemic of online grooming. \u201cWolf Pack has opened my eyes to how I can prevent this happening to my kids and help other people. I definitely feel I\u2019m making a difference. Since we\u2019ve started pointing this out to people, the police, the courts, the right people are hearing it. They know there\u2019s an epidemic. Do we want to live in a country that just lets this happen?\u201d</p>",

Scotland, confirms the increase in hunting activity north of the border, but warns: \u201cWhile many online activist groups are genuinely trying to help, they often fail to consider the risk of harm to their target, as well as their family and friends. Their work can also be counterproductive \u2013 the evidence they supply is often not high enough quality to secure a conviction.\u201d The police take a firm official line on OCAAGs \u2013 the NPCC is clear that \u201cwe do not endorse these groups and will not work with them\u201d, while Police Scotland says: \u201cIt\u2019s understandable that people want to protect children from harm but we would ask them not to take the law into their own hands.\u201d According to the force, nearly 1,600 crimes where an individual communicated with a child for sexual purposes were recorded between April 2018 and February 2019. Police sources also express frustration that these incidents pull resources from high-harm cases to low-grade grooming offences that might not even make it to court. But the hunting groups say individual police officers are more supportive of their activities. Sophie (not her real name) runs the Child Protectors Scotland team, which has about 30 members, ranging in age from early 20s to 60s. \u201cCertain police forces will work with us, but they\u2019d never admit it. For example, we might call and say we\u2019re planning a sting at a certain time, and they\u2019ll ask us to delay it because they\u2019re busy. I\u2019ve had police officers shake me by the hand. They know we\u2019re not leaving any time soon.\u201d Speaking to a number of Scottish OCAAGs, what is immediately striking is the degree of organisation involved. Wolf Pack decoys, for example, are given a lengthy handbook that includes suggested childlike responses and tips on evidence gathering. They are also instructed never to initiate sexual conversation or arrangements to meet in person. Decoys are trained to talk about school, homework and parents, and to explain their inexperience if a person tries to introduce sexual content to the exchange. They are also taught to move the chat to WhatsApp as quickly as possible so the conversation can be easily retrieved and is encrypted, reducing the chances of mistaken identity. As CiCi explains: \u201cSome will say immediately: \u201cOh, you\u2019re too young,\u2019 and sometimes report you; others continue to talk. I\u2019m always reminding them of my age. When it comes into the sexual chat, I say: \u2018I don\u2019t know anything about that,\u2019 and again the ball is in their court. Some will go right into it, by which I mean graphic details, pictures, videos, links to porn sites, things that kids should not be seeing.\u201d At a face-to-face meeting, the alleged offender will be met by members of the OCAAG, who will immediately make a citizen\u2019s arrest and call the police, livestreaming the incident to the Wolf Pack Hunters UK Facebook page while waiting for the police to attend. It is this practice of filmed confrontation, reminiscent of the US TV show To Catch a Predator, which originally ran from 2004 to 2008, that is most controversial. Braid insists the Wolf Pack team \u201cwill protect both the hunter and the predator\u201d and that stings are timed to last for no longer than 15 minutes, to ensure a potentially aggressive crowd does not gather. But last summer, on a housing estate in the West Lothian town of Armadale, a man who was already a registered sex offender was taken into protective custody for his own safety after an angry mob gathered around his house and a car was set on fire. Braid says the group visited the man\u2019s house because they were concerned that he was living with children of a similar age to the Wolf Pack decoy he was talking to, and insists the location was not posted online in advance. He adds that \u201cdespite the events being portrayed negatively in the media, we have had overwhelming support from the people of Armadale\u201d. The man who was hounded out of his home later pleaded guilty to a grooming charge. Interviews with those involved in OCAAGs reveal a strong belief that sexual abuse of children, particularly online grooming, is not being taken seriously enough by the authorities. But their motivation also stems from a deeper personal motivation. \u201cAlmost everybody in the group has direct personal experience of abuse,\u201d one member said. Group members also insist that stings are only the most visible part of their activities, which include internet safety advice to worried parents, support to individuals disclosing historical abuse for the first time, and a gathering place for people who feel their concerns about children\u2019s safety are not being heard elsewhere. CiCi, who has acted as a decoy on about 20 stings, is hopeful that her work is starting to alert those in authority to what she sees as an epidemic of online grooming. \u201cWolf Pack has opened my eyes to how I can prevent this happening to my kids and help other people. I definitely feel I\u2019m making a difference. Since we\u2019ve started pointing this out to people, the police, the courts, the right people are hearing it. They know there\u2019s an epidemic. Do we want to live in a country that just lets this happen?\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Our fathers \u2013 whether present or absent \u2013 have a huge impact on our lives. In both Leyla Josephine and Charlotte Josephine\u2019s new shows, dads are complicated. Their failures land heavily, bruising the next generation, yet there remains a trace of tangible, unconditional love.</p> <p><strong>Daddy Drag</strong> begins, deceptively, by poking fun. Leyla Josephine gleefully whips out every stereotype in the book: dad jokes, fishing trips, beers and barbecues. Dressed in drag as a bearded, beer-bellied father \u2013 her father? \u2013 she dad-raps and teases audience members. This everydad is silly, laddish and affectionate, his motto a constant refrain of \u201cI\u2019m only joking\u201d. He\u2019s a manchild who\u2019s used to being the \u201cfun\u201d parent, free of responsibilities \u2013 the manifestation of society\u2019s expectations of fatherhood.</p> <p>As the show goes on, it becomes clear that this both is and isn\u2019t Josephine\u2019s own, larger-than-life father. Because stereotypes can\u2019t contain a person. As we learn through audio recordings of Josephine and her mother, her dad was a complex, multifaceted man. He was unforgettable, lovable, always cracking a joke; he was also mysterious, secretive, a notorious ladies man. Gradually, uncomfortable facts spill out \u2013 his children with other women, his problems with drink \u2013 and erode the crumbling facade of the character Josephine has created in front of us. The costume is dismantled as the truth starts to emerge.</p> <p>Similar ties of love and betrayal bind the father and daughter in <strong>Pops</strong>. But in Charlotte Josephine\u2019s play, the real drama lives and breathes in what\u2019s not said. Josephine and director Ali Pidsley are unafraid of silence, painting as much with pauses as with words. These wordless sequences are bold, lasting for longer than is comfortable. And when the characters do speak, their repeated banalities \u2013 \u201chi love\u201d, \u201csit down\u201d \u2013 break all the rules that writers are taught.

      "bodyText": "Our fathers \u2013 whether present or absent \u2013 have a huge impact on our lives. In both Leyla Josephine and Charlotte Josephine\u2019s new shows, dads are complicated. Their failures land heavily, bruising the next generation, yet there remains a trace of tangible, unconditional love. Daddy Drag begins, deceptively, by poking fun. Leyla Josephine gleefully whips out every stereotype in the book: dad jokes, fishing trips, beers and barbecues. Dressed in drag as a bearded, beer-bellied father \u2013 her father? \u2013 she dad-raps and teases audience members. This everydad is silly, laddish and affectionate, his motto a constant refrain of \u201cI\u2019m only joking\u201d. He\u2019s a manchild who\u2019s used to being the \u201cfun\u201d parent, free of responsibilities \u2013 the manifestation of society\u2019s expectations of fatherhood. As the show goes on, it becomes clear that this both is and isn\u2019t Josephine\u2019s own, larger-than-life father. Because stereotypes can\u2019t contain a person. As we learn through audio recordings of Josephine and her mother, her dad was a complex, multifaceted man. He was unforgettable, lovable, always cracking a joke; he was also mysterious, secretive, a notorious ladies man. Gradually, uncomfortable facts spill out \u2013 his children with other women, his problems with drink \u2013 and erode the crumbling facade of the character Josephine has created in front of us. The costume is dismantled as the truth starts to emerge. Similar ties of love and betrayal bind the father and daughter in Pops. But in Charlotte Josephine\u2019s play, the real drama lives and breathes in what\u2019s not said. Josephine and director Ali Pidsley are unafraid of silence, painting as much with pauses as with words. These wordless sequences are bold, lasting for longer than is comfortable. And when the characters do speak, their repeated banalities \u2013 \u201chi love\u201d, \u201csit down\u201d \u2013 break all the rules that writers are taught. Plays are not meant to look like this. But by zoning in on the mundane, Josephine is able to shake off the baggage of familiar, sensational depictions of what addiction does to families. Josephine refuses to even voice the word \u201caddiction\u201d, never naming the destructive force that taints this father-daughter relationship. Instead, we\u2019re left to piece things together as the pair\u2019s brittle routine loops round and round, occasionally interrupted by fleeting moments of connection. The slowly accreting power of this suffocating silence and repetition feels more truthful than the sobbing and hair-tearing more common to portraits of substance abuse. Much of this is down to the extraordinary performances of Nigel Barrett and Sophie Melville, who turn each lingering silence into a symphony of suppressed emotion.

      "body": "<p>Early last week, for the briefest of moments, the tensions swirling around Scotland\u2019s relationship with England and the deepening UK crisis of Brexit were perfectly symbolised by Boris Johnson\u2019s arm.</p> <p>Amid the angry noise of a crowd of demonstrators, Johnson was on the steps of Bute House (the Edinburgh residence of the Scottish first minister) exchanging the usual opening pleasantries with Nicola Sturgeon for the benefit of photographers and TV crews. Then came the moment when everyone had to go inside \u2013 whereupon Johnson rather condescendingly extended one of his upper limbs, with a view to escorting Sturgeon into her own HQ. She appeared to say something, whereupon the arm went down and Johnson awkwardly walked in, a moment that inevitably went viral.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I said: \u2018Put your arm down,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cThose kind of things happen in a flash. But I am aware that he was trying to do something that some people would describe as chivalrous and other people would say was a subconscious powerplay. I was kind of aware of him trying to \u2026 usher me in.\u201d She smiles. \u201cAnd I think, in the instant, I thought: \u2018That\u2019s inappropriate \u2013 you go in first.\u2019 But these things happen in a nanosecond. It wasn\u2019t at all deliberate on my part.\u201d</p> <p>One thing, however, was certain: she did not look happy. \u201cAgain, you\u2019ve got to remember that these photos are taken in an instant,\u201d she insists. \u201cBut, that said, I abhor what he is trying to do to the UK. And I abhor what the implications of that are for Scotland. So I don\u2019t think it will be surprising to anyone to hear me say that I wasn\u2019t absolutely thrilled to be welcoming Boris Johnson as prime minister.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"401759eab9075ffe398682be61ce0ed8390230d2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/401759eab9075ffe398682be61ce0ed8390230d2/1010_774_1397_838/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I don\u2019t think I said: \u201cPut your arm down.\u201d\u2019 The incident outside Bute House.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I don\u2019t think I said: \u201cPut your arm down.\u201d\u2019 The incident outside Bute House.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jane Barlow/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Before that meeting, they had crossed paths once before \u2013 at the VE Day celebrations immediately after the 2015 general election, at which Johnson brusquely asked Sturgeon if granting the Scottish government full control over its tax and spending powers would silence calls for independence. \u201cWe walked together through Horse Guards Parade. And I vividly remember, he said something like \u2013 and this is not a direct quote \u2013 \u2018What would buy you off? Would full fiscal autonomy buy you off?\u2019 I said: \u2018No, not really.\u2019\u201d She laughs.</p> <p>Four years on, she conveys a similar sense of Johnson reducing complex questions to breezy inanities. \u201cTalking to him, there\u2019s a sort of surreal element to it,\u201d she says. \u201cHe talks about Brexit, and a no-deal Brexit in particular, as if there is nothing to worry about, and anyone who says there is just being pessimistic and downbeat. I was very frank with him that I think it would be catastrophic, if it were allowed to happen. But, you know, then there\u2019s just a waving of the hands, and: \u2018No \u2013 it\u2019ll all be fine, and anyone who says otherwise is just indulging in doom and gloom.\u2019 I described it after the meeting as dangerous. \u2019Cos it <em>is</em> dangerous.\u201d</p> <p>One other aspect of Sturgeon\u2019s discussions with Johnson is fascinating. To <a href=\"https://www.holyrood.com/articles/inside-politics/smiling-assassin-interview-first-minister-nicola-sturgeon\" title=\"\">quote</a><a href=\"https://www.holyrood.com/articles/inside-politics/smiling-assassin-interview-first-minister-nicola-sturgeon\" title=\"\"> a profile</a> of her published a few years ago, Sturgeon is \u201cstate-educated, working-class, left-leaning and believably human\u201d. Johnson, who, by contrast, swaggered to where he is along a familiar path that passed through Eton and Oxford, has created his borderline absurd persona with the kind of chutzpah that tends to be the preserve of the truly posh. Class, I suggest, must have been a constant subtext in their exchanges.</p> <p>\u201cI do think there\u2019s an element of \u2026\u201d she pauses. \u201cWell, I said a moment ago that he talks what, in my view, is a load of nonsense, with utter conviction. And I do think there was an element of that sense of entitlement; the idea that you can make anybody believe anything if you say it in a particular way.\u201d</p> <p>Sturgeon became first minister in late 2014, taking over from Alex Salmond after the referendum on Scottish independence was won by the no campaign, but her party was still in the midst of its imperial phase; it would go on to win 56 out of 59 Scottish seats in the 2015 general election.</p> <p>She is one of those politicians whose voice and mannerisms seem instantly familiar: the precise, sometimes overlong, distinctly lawyerly sentences; the way that even her most speech-like utterances contain enough everyday humanity to keep you interested. Her humour, when it enters the conversation, gives a subtle sense of someone who appreciates the ridiculousness of politics, particularly at a time like this. But, unlike Johnson, she is also at pains to point out that Brexit is deadly serious, and that Britain faces \u201cthe most rightwing government we have had in my lifetime, probably including the Thatcher governments\u201d.</p> <p>We talk for an hour in one of Bute House\u2019s meeting rooms on the same day that the Bank of England is saying that there is a one in three chance of a Brexit recession, and Sky News has published a wad of civil service documents warning that a no-deal exit could trigger \u201cpotential consumer panic and food shortages\u201d, \u201coperational gaps\u201d in policing and national security, and \u201claw and order challenges\u201d in Northern Ireland. Given that the UK was meant to leave the EU on 29 March, Sturgeon says that she and her ministers have been grappling with this kind of stuff for a long time. \u201cA lot of the focus has been on continuity of transport \u2013 particularly ferries, and making sure we\u2019ll have supplies of food,\u201d she says. She also mentions \u201cadequate supplies of medicine\u201d, among \u201cmany and varied aspects of what this will mean for people\u2019s lives\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I think the abdication of leadership on the part of Jeremy Corbyn right now will be the stuff of history books</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>If he were here now, I suggest, Johnson might assure her that whatever the disastrous projections of a no-deal Brexit, and however much time and money has been spent preparing for one, it is a negotiating ploy. She half agrees, but insists that whatever he and his allies say, Johnson\u2019s reckless approach to leaving the EU is pointing to inevitable catastrophe.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not breaching confidences here because he\u2019s saying this publicly: he\u2019s saying he doesn\u2019t want a no-deal Brexit, and he doesn\u2019t think that\u2019s where we\u2019ll end up. But that\u2019s part of the delusion in his position. He has set a negotiating position that everybody knows is unachievable: getting rid of the backstop in its entirety, getting rid of the withdrawal agreement in its entirety and starting all over again. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anybody outside his circle and the hangers-on around it who thinks that is remotely achievable. So, if that\u2019s your starting point, where do you go from there, other than over that cliff-edge?\u201d</p> <p>The prospect of this calamity is a big part of Sturgeon\u2019s other focus of attention: the SNP\u2019s renewed push for a second independence referendum. It\u2019s her second since the Brexit vote: in 2017, she announced her intention to hold another Scottish referendum in 2019, only to retreat. Now, she says, the prospect of the UK finally leaving the EU \u2013 and the distinct prospect of us doing so in the most damaging way possible \u2013 makes the case for a vote unanswerable, even if senior Tories from the prime minister down have made it clear that they will not grant her government the relevant powers.</p> <p>She has said she wants a referendum on independence by 2021 and that the second half of next year would be the right time. \u201cThat\u2019s what I intend, yeah.\u201d</p> <p>So what happens when the Westminster government says she can\u2019t have one? \u201cWell, look, if we get to that bridge, I will set out how I intend to cross it \u2026 We\u2019ve got legislation going through the Scottish parliament that is necessary for a referendum on that timescale. When we get to the endpoint of that legislation, we\u2019ll then have that discussion with the UK government about the transfer of power.\u201d</p> <p>Will it be a discussion? Or a historic clash? \u201cLet\u2019s wait and see, OK? And then I\u2019ll set out how we intend to deal with that.\u201d</p> <p>After her meeting with Johnson, she said he hadn\u2019t been \u201cat his most comfortable\u201d when talking about the case for a second independence vote. What did she mean by that? \u201cHe didn\u2019t have much of an answer. He can defend the union and oppose independence: that\u2019s entirely legitimate. He kept trying to get back to the substance of the argument about independence. And the point I made back to him was: \u2018Let\u2019s have the debate on the substance, but let\u2019s have it out there and let the public decide.\u2019 I suggested we might do a live TV debate on it, at which point he decided it was time to go,\u201d she says laughing. \u201cOr his advisers decided it was time to go.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9467afc6461bcf3941f007673483f025b28d350c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9467afc6461bcf3941f007673483f025b28d350c/255_354_5505_3303/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sturgeon with Alex Salmond in 2013, launching the Scottish government\u2019s white paper on independence.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sturgeon with Alex Salmond in 2013, launching the Scottish government\u2019s white paper on independence.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2014, political discourse was already smattered with fake news and polarised nastiness, and, although most of the debate around Scottish independence was substantial and serious, the independence referendum campaign and its aftermath were no exception. Before and after, for example, I met lots of people who had read online that the vote was rigged, and seemed to believe it, and occasionally witnessed aggression that could explode in an instant, online and in the real world. Another Scottish referendum, I suggest, could potentially be a horrible, rancorous mess.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it has to be. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s inevitable at all. The kind of tone and tenor of political debate, and I\u2019m not just talking Scotland here, I\u2019m talking globally \u2026 of course that concerns me. I think it should concern every right-thinking politician. I think one of the challenges for politicians who don\u2019t want politics to continue in that direction is that we have got to be prepared to stand up for a reasoned, logical and respectful way of political debate.\u201d</p> <p>But do people even listen? It\u2019s out of her control, surely? \u201cBut the alternative is a counsel of despair \u2026 that\u2019s not the kind of politician I am. I think there\u2019s a need for politicians who actually value a type of political debate to stand up for that, and defend it, however difficult and, at times, seemingly hopeless that may be.\u201d</p> <p>A little later, she expands further: \u201cWithout saying that anything will ever be perfect, if you contrast the independence referendum with the Brexit referendum, they were worlds apart. You had an electorate in Scotland in 2014 that was highly informed, engaged and knew what they were talking about. That wasn\u2019t the case in 2016, when the equivalent of the 800-page independence prospectus was the lie on the side of the bus.\u201d</p> <p>There is one aspect of the immediate future that we can only talk about in the most minimal way. At some point next year, Salmond will go on trial on two charges of attempted rape, nine of sexual assault, two of indecent assault and one of breach of the peace \u2013 allegations that he continues to strongly deny. Inevitably, the outcome of any Scottish referendum partly hinges on what happens, doesn\u2019t it?</p> <p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think it does. I don\u2019t think it does. We\u2019re talking here about the future of a country. But, for reasons you will understand, it\u2019s not something I\u2019m able to talk about in any more depth or at any more length.\u201d</p> <p>Does she expect to be a participant in the trial? \u201cLook, it\u2019s a criminal process. It would be utterly inappropriate for me to say anything about it.\u201d</p> <p>Leaving aside another independence referendum, the big event that may well materialise very soon is a UK general election. In 2017, amid talk of public weariness about another independence referendum, the SNP lost 21 Westminster seats. Now, she thinks the prospect of Brexit would make things very different. South of the border, I remind her, there is a lot of talk about looking on the bright side of Labour\u2019s dismal poll numbers: the idea that they could at least win enough seats to strike some kind of deal with the SNP and take power that way.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fc9b451d8c86bb3313b3c4453faa6b22100f7953\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc9b451d8c86bb3313b3c4453faa6b22100f7953/0_86_4252_2551/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sturgeon talking to Jeremy Corbyn in 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sturgeon talking to Jeremy Corbyn in 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Matthews/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI have fought two general elections now as SNP leader, and, in both of them, I have been pretty candid. We would always want to be part of a progressive alternative to a Tory government. That remains the case. That said, I\u2019m no great fan of Jeremy Corbyn. I think his lack of leadership on Brexit in particular \u2026 well, if we do crash out without a deal, he will bear almost as much responsibility as Theresa May or Boris Johnson. I can\u2019t see the SNP going into formal coalition with Labour.\u201d</p> <p>Does she rule it out? \u201cLook, I think in politics you\u2019ve got to be careful. But it would not be my intention, to go into a formal coalition. I said that in 2015 and 2017 \u2013 that\u2019s not a new thing. But some kind of progressive alliance that could lock the Tories out of government \u2026 it wouldn\u2019t be a blank-cheque type scenario. We would want Jeremy Corbyn to take a very firm anti-Brexit position. We would look to do what was right for Scotland.\u201d (If Brexit were somehow cancelled, Sturgeon has said that the possibility of an independence referendum would remain because \u201cScotland needs to keep its options as open as possible.\u201d)</p> <p>Our time is running out: among Sturgeon\u2019s engagements today is a Scottish cabinet meeting, which will spend \u201ca fair chunk of time\u201d talking about no-deal planning.

      "bodyText": "Early last week, for the briefest of moments, the tensions swirling around Scotland\u2019s relationship with England and the deepening UK crisis of Brexit were perfectly symbolised by Boris Johnson\u2019s arm. Amid the angry noise of a crowd of demonstrators, Johnson was on the steps of Bute House (the Edinburgh residence of the Scottish first minister) exchanging the usual opening pleasantries with Nicola Sturgeon for the benefit of photographers and TV crews. Then came the moment when everyone had to go inside \u2013 whereupon Johnson rather condescendingly extended one of his upper limbs, with a view to escorting Sturgeon into her own HQ. She appeared to say something, whereupon the arm went down and Johnson awkwardly walked in, a moment that inevitably went viral. \u201cI don\u2019t think I said: \u2018Put your arm down,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cThose kind of things happen in a flash. But I am aware that he was trying to do something that some people would describe as chivalrous and other people would say was a subconscious powerplay. I was kind of aware of him trying to \u2026 usher me in.\u201d She smiles. \u201cAnd I think, in the instant, I thought: \u2018That\u2019s inappropriate \u2013 you go in first.\u2019 But these things happen in a nanosecond. It wasn\u2019t at all deliberate on my part.\u201d One thing, however, was certain: she did not look happy. \u201cAgain, you\u2019ve got to remember that these photos are taken in an instant,\u201d she insists. \u201cBut, that said, I abhor what he is trying to do to the UK. And I abhor what the implications of that are for Scotland. So I don\u2019t think it will be surprising to anyone to hear me say that I wasn\u2019t absolutely thrilled to be welcoming Boris Johnson as prime minister.\u201d Before that meeting, they had crossed paths once before \u2013 at the VE Day celebrations immediately after the 2015 general election, at which Johnson brusquely asked Sturgeon if granting the Scottish government full control over its tax and spending powers would silence calls for independence. \u201cWe walked together through Horse Guards Parade. And I vividly remember, he said something like \u2013 and this is not a direct quote \u2013 \u2018What would buy you off? Would full fiscal autonomy buy you off?\u2019 I said: \u2018No, not really.\u2019\u201d She laughs. Four years on, she conveys a similar sense of Johnson reducing complex questions to breezy inanities. \u201cTalking to him, there\u2019s a sort of surreal element to it,\u201d she says. \u201cHe talks about Brexit, and a no-deal Brexit in particular, as if there is nothing to worry about, and anyone who says there is just being pessimistic and downbeat. I was very frank with him that I think it would be catastrophic, if it were allowed to happen. But, you know, then there\u2019s just a waving of the hands, and: \u2018No \u2013 it\u2019ll all be fine, and anyone who says otherwise is just indulging in doom and gloom.\u2019 I described it after the meeting as dangerous. \u2019Cos it is dangerous.\u201d One other aspect of Sturgeon\u2019s discussions with Johnson is fascinating. To quote a profile of her published a few years ago, Sturgeon is \u201cstate-educated, working-class, left-leaning and believably human\u201d. Johnson, who, by contrast, swaggered to where he is along a familiar path that passed through Eton and Oxford, has created his borderline absurd persona with the kind of chutzpah that tends to be the preserve of the truly posh. Class, I suggest, must have been a constant subtext in their exchanges. \u201cI do think there\u2019s an element of \u2026\u201d she pauses. \u201cWell, I said a moment ago that he talks what, in my view, is a load of nonsense, with utter conviction. And I do think there was an element of that sense of entitlement; the idea that you can make anybody believe anything if you say it in a particular way.\u201d Sturgeon became first minister in late 2014, taking over from Alex Salmond after the referendum on Scottish independence was won by the no campaign, but her party was still in the midst of its imperial phase; it would go on to win 56 out of 59 Scottish seats in the 2015 general election. She is one of those politicians whose voice and mannerisms seem instantly familiar: the precise, sometimes overlong, distinctly lawyerly sentences; the way that even her most speech-like utterances contain enough everyday humanity to keep you interested. Her humour, when it enters the conversation, gives a subtle sense of someone who appreciates the ridiculousness of politics, particularly at a time like this. But, unlike Johnson, she is also at pains to point out that Brexit is deadly serious, and that Britain faces \u201cthe most rightwing government we have had in my lifetime, probably including the Thatcher governments\u201d. We talk for an hour in one of Bute House\u2019s meeting rooms on the same day that the Bank of England is saying that there is a one in three chance of a Brexit recession, and Sky News has published a wad of civil service documents warning that a no-deal exit could trigger \u201cpotential consumer panic and food shortages\u201d, \u201coperational gaps\u201d in policing and national security, and \u201claw and order challenges\u201d in Northern Ireland. Given that the UK was meant to leave the EU on 29 March, Sturgeon says that she and her ministers have been grappling with this kind of stuff for a long time. \u201cA lot of the focus has been on continuity of transport \u2013 particularly ferries, and making sure we\u2019ll have supplies of food,\u201d she says. She also mentions \u201cadequate supplies of medicine\u201d, among \u201cmany and varied aspects of what this will mean for people\u2019s lives\u201d. If he were here now, I suggest, Johnson might assure her that whatever the disastrous projections of a no-deal Brexit, and however much time and money has been spent preparing for one, it is a negotiating ploy. She half agrees, but insists that whatever he and his allies say, Johnson\u2019s reckless approach to leaving the EU is pointing to inevitable catastrophe. \u201cI\u2019m not breaching confidences here because he\u2019s saying this publicly: he\u2019s saying he doesn\u2019t want a no-deal Brexit, and he doesn\u2019t think that\u2019s where we\u2019ll end up. But that\u2019s part of the delusion in his position. He has set a negotiating position that everybody knows is unachievable: getting rid of the backstop in its entirety, getting rid of the withdrawal agreement in its entirety and starting all over again. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anybody outside his circle and the hangers-on around it who thinks that is remotely achievable. So, if that\u2019s your starting point, where do you go from there, other than over that cliff-edge?\u201d The prospect of this calamity is a big part of Sturgeon\u2019s other focus of attention: the SNP\u2019s renewed push for a second independence referendum. It\u2019s her second since the Brexit vote: in 2017, she announced her intention to hold another Scottish referendum in 2019, only to retreat. Now, she says, the prospect of the UK finally leaving the EU \u2013 and the distinct prospect of us doing so in the most damaging way possible \u2013 makes the case for a vote unanswerable, even if senior Tories from the prime minister down have made it clear that they will not grant her government the relevant powers. She has said she wants a referendum on independence by 2021 and that the second half of next year would be the right time. \u201cThat\u2019s what I intend, yeah.\u201d So what happens when the Westminster government says she can\u2019t have one? \u201cWell, look, if we get to that bridge, I will set out how I intend to cross it \u2026 We\u2019ve got legislation going through the Scottish parliament that is necessary for a referendum on that timescale. When we get to the endpoint of that legislation, we\u2019ll then have that discussion with the UK government about the transfer of power.\u201d Will it be a discussion? Or a historic clash? \u201cLet\u2019s wait and see, OK? And then I\u2019ll set out how we intend to deal with that.\u201d After her meeting with Johnson, she said he hadn\u2019t been \u201cat his most comfortable\u201d when talking about the case for a second independence vote. What did she mean by that? \u201cHe didn\u2019t have much of an answer. He can defend the union and oppose independence: that\u2019s entirely legitimate. He kept trying to get back to the substance of the argument about independence. And the point I made back to him was: \u2018Let\u2019s have the debate on the substance, but let\u2019s have it out there and let the public decide.\u2019 I suggested we might do a live TV debate on it, at which point he decided it was time to go,\u201d she says laughing. \u201cOr his advisers decided it was time to go.\u201d In 2014, political discourse was already smattered with fake news and polarised nastiness, and, although most of the debate around Scottish independence was substantial and serious, the independence referendum campaign and its aftermath were no exception. Before and after, for example, I met lots of people who had read online that the vote was rigged, and seemed to believe it, and occasionally witnessed aggression that could explode in an instant, online and in the real world. Another Scottish referendum, I suggest, could potentially be a horrible, rancorous mess. \u201cI don\u2019t think it has to be. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s inevitable at all. The kind of tone and tenor of political debate, and I\u2019m not just talking Scotland here, I\u2019m talking globally \u2026 of course that concerns me. I think it should concern every right-thinking politician. I think one of the challenges for politicians who don\u2019t want politics to continue in that direction is that we have got to be prepared to stand up for a reasoned, logical and respectful way of political debate.\u201d But do people even listen? It\u2019s out of her control, surely? \u201cBut the alternative is a counsel of despair \u2026 that\u2019s not the kind of politician I am. I think there\u2019s a need for politicians who actually value a type of political debate to stand up for that, and defend it, however difficult and, at times, seemingly hopeless that may be.\u201d A little later, she expands further: \u201cWithout saying that anything will ever be perfect, if you contrast the independence referendum with the Brexit referendum, they were worlds apart. You had an electorate in Scotland in 2014 that was highly informed, engaged and knew what they were talking about. That wasn\u2019t the case in 2016, when the equivalent of the 800-page independence prospectus was the lie on the side of the bus.\u201d There is one aspect of the immediate future that we can only talk about in the most minimal way. At some point next year, Salmond will go on trial on two charges of attempted rape, nine of sexual assault, two of indecent assault and one of breach of the peace \u2013 allegations that he continues to strongly deny. Inevitably, the outcome of any Scottish referendum partly hinges on what happens, doesn\u2019t it? \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think it does. I don\u2019t think it does. We\u2019re talking here about the future of a country. But, for reasons you will understand, it\u2019s not something I\u2019m able to talk about in any more depth or at any more length.\u201d Does she expect to be a participant in the trial? \u201cLook, it\u2019s a criminal process. It would be utterly inappropriate for me to say anything about it.\u201d Leaving aside another independence referendum, the big event that may well materialise very soon is a UK general election. In 2017, amid talk of public weariness about another independence referendum, the SNP lost 21 Westminster seats. Now, she thinks the prospect of Brexit would make things very different. South of the border, I remind her, there is a lot of talk about looking on the bright side of Labour\u2019s dismal poll numbers: the idea that they could at least win enough seats to strike some kind of deal with the SNP and take power that way. \u201cI have fought two general elections now as SNP leader, and, in both of them, I have been pretty candid. We would always want to be part of a progressive alternative to a Tory government. That remains the case. That said, I\u2019m no great fan of Jeremy Corbyn. I think his lack of leadership on Brexit in particular \u2026 well, if we do crash out without a deal, he will bear almost as much responsibility as Theresa May or Boris Johnson. I can\u2019t see the SNP going into formal coalition with Labour.\u201d Does she rule it out? \u201cLook, I think in politics you\u2019ve got to be careful. But it would not be my intention, to go into a formal coalition. I said that in 2015 and 2017 \u2013 that\u2019s not a new thing. But some kind of progressive alliance that could lock the Tories out of government \u2026 it wouldn\u2019t be a blank-cheque type scenario. We would want Jeremy Corbyn to take a very firm anti-Brexit position. We would look to do what was right for Scotland.\u201d (If Brexit were somehow cancelled, Sturgeon has said that the possibility of an independence referendum would remain because \u201cScotland needs to keep its options as open as possible.\u201d) Our time is running out: among Sturgeon\u2019s engagements today is a Scottish cabinet meeting, which will spend \u201ca fair chunk of time\u201d talking about no-deal planning. I have only one more question: what would be her advice to someone who lives in England? \u201cMove to Scotland,\u201d she says, with a quiet laugh. Is she at least half-serious? \u201cMore than half-serious. We need more people in Scotland. Absolutely: move to Scotland.\u201d But if someone can\u2019t, or won\u2019t? \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult. And I don\u2019t have an obvious answer to that. I think the abdication of leadership on the part of Jeremy Corbyn right now will be as much of the stuff of the history books as what\u2019s happening in the Tory party. And I think it\u2019s tragic.

The premise sounds politically charged, but the director Maziar Lahooti\u2019s execution is bizarrely coy, rarely articulating his themes in a direct way.

      "bodyText": "Making a comedy themed around Australia\u2019s immigration detention system inevitably entails an element of risk, but one can never underestimate the power of well-directed farce or ironic statements. That is what I told myself going into the new Australian film Below, starring Ryan Corr as a detention centre employee who makes a mint from streaming footage of detainees fighting inside a rectangular outdoor cage \u2013 which looks vaguely like something from Mad Max or Turkey Shoot. Going in, I had in my mind something along the lines of the asylum seeker comedy Lucky Miles, which put forward political commentary by invoking the absurdity of various situations \u2013 many involving flummoxed characters walking cluelessly across an unforgiving Australian landscape. Instead I found something much more elusive. The premise sounds politically charged, but the director Maziar Lahooti\u2019s execution is bizarrely coy, rarely articulating his themes in a direct way. The result is a film that\u2019s difficult to grab on to, emotionally or intellectually. Below begins with a bloodied Corr, playing Dougie, getting beaten up by an unseen party, in a scene drawn out stylishly by a slow-mo shot of a keyboard connecting with his face. When his stepdad Terry (Anthony LaPaglia) comes home, the beaten-up young man, who has a history in ratcheting various unsuccessful schemes, opens up about his financial troubles. Dougie owes money to the wrong kind of people, following a couple of dud projects: something about an old-school rave where ravers pay with rainbows (naturally) and a streaming service broadcasting dodgy v\u00e9rit\u00e9 videos. To pay off his debts, Dougie reluctantly agrees to come work for Terry in a detention centre. The first glimpse of life inside its barbed walls shows a man covering himself in petrol then threatening to light himself on fire. Surprisingly, however, the director does not do much to explore this location or present it as a place of intense ongoing drama. There are rarely more than a small number of people on screen at any time (most of the film comprises dialogue exchanges between two characters) and the central location does not feel large, or particularly populated. The energy of the film is surprisingly low-key, very much in the vein of a filmed play \u2013 not unexpectedly, given it was adapted from Ian Wilding\u2019s stage production of the same name, which was based in an outback mining town rather than a detention centre. Below is set slightly in the future, which explains a jumbled aesthetic (with recycled props and sparse looking backgrounds) as well as freeing it from the expectation of capturing a realistic view of life inside a detention centre. The guards force detainees to participate in one-on-one fights inside the aforementioned cage, with Dougie selling streaming access to faceless online voyeurs and sadists. These grotesque live streams prove popular, as they did in last year\u2019s terrific techno-thriller Cam, which scanned for crumbs of humanity inside a cesspool of online smut. But Below stays clear of exploring voyeurism, and online culture, and even the motivations of the content creator beyond a rudimentary desire to earn cash. Nor does Lahooti offer much overt commentary about the Australian government\u2019s attitude towards asylum seekers \u2013 though there are cryptic messages here and there. The first is the appearance of the film\u2019s title stamped on top of an upside down map of Australia. Others are expressed through Terry\u2019s description of the detention centre.

The frame also has a tendency to dance around, as if unsettled. There are unusual cuts from the veteran editor Ken Sallows (whose oeuvre includes classics such as Malcolm, Chopper and Gurrumul). The overall feel is one of a film engaged in a constant process of finding itself. Corr\u2019s oddly engaging performance is the glue that binds it together. He is erratic and cartoonishly outr\u00e9, but gives the film a continuity not present in its deliberately discordant production values. I found myself sometimes frustrated by Lahooti\u2019s enigmatic approach. What is he trying to say? Why?

The 22 victims ranged in age from 15 to 90 years old. Fifteen people who were left injured by the attack remained in the hospital, with two in critical condition. The victims include Jordan and Andre Anchondo, 25 and 23, who were killed while protecting their two-month-old son. \u201cHer husband was in front of the gunman to protect Jordan, and Jordan was protecting her baby,\u201d Monique Terry, Jordan Anchondo\u2019s 21-year-old cousin, told the Guardian on Sunday. Arturo Benavides, 59, was an army veteran and a bus driver for El Paso\u2019s public transit system, according to CNN. He was at the self-checkout line at Walmart when the shooting started. A niece described him as \u201ca strong-willed, caring, giving and special person\u201d. Ivan Manzano, 41, had crossed the border to visit Walmart to pick up a package he had ordered for his business, reported the El Paso Times. \u201cWe assume that at 10am to 10.15, he walked into the Walmart, because in his Whatsapp messages, it shows that he was last connected at 10.21,\u201d said his aunt Patricia Manzano. Javier Amir Rodriguez, 15, was about to start his second year of high school at Horizon high school in El Paso, according to the El Paso Times. His aunt described him as a loving boy, who did well in school and loved soccer. Angie Englisbee, 86, was in the check-out line when the shooting started, ABC 13 reported. A grandson described her as \u201cthe hero of our family\u201d who \u201cworked hard her entire life and was a very devout Catholic\u201d. Leo Campos and Maribel Hernandez had reportedly dropped their dog off at the groomer before being caught in the Walmart attack. Mar\u00eda Legarreta Rothe from Chihuahua was on her way to pick up her daughter at the airport before she stopped at the Walmart to make some purchases, according to El Diario. The other victims who were Mexican nationals were Sara Regalado, 66, of Ju\u00e1rez, and her husband, Adolfo Hern\u00e1ndez, 68, of Aguascalientes; Jorge Garc\u00eda from Coahuila; Elsa Mendoza de la Mora from Yepomera; Gloria M\u00e1rquez from Ju\u00e1rez; and Ivan Manzano from Ju\u00e1rez. Authorities identified the remaining victims from the US as Maria Flores, 77, Raul Flores, 77, David Johnson, 63, Luis Juarez, 90, Elsa Libera Marquez, 57, Maribel Loya, 56, Margie Reckard, 63, and Juan Velazquez, 77. In Dayton, Ohio, where eight were shot dead in an attack that came just 13 hours after the El Paso incident, the assailant left no clue to his motivation. The Dayton police chief, Richard Biehl, confirmed that the victims of gunman Connor Betts include his own sister, 22-year-old Megan Betts. Connor Betts was killed by police less than a minute after the rampage began, bringing the total number of fatalities in that attack to nine. Lois Oglesby, 27, was a nurse and mother of two. \u201cShe was a wonderful mother, a wonderful person,\u201d friend Derasha Merrett told the Dayton Daily News. \u201cI have cried so much, I can\u2019t cry anymore.\u201d Derrick Fudge, 57 from Springfield, Ohio, was visiting Dayton with his son. \u201cHe had a dog ... that he loved dearly. ... He was fun, happy,\u201d his niece, Asia Fudge, told NPR. A resident of Springboro, Ohio, Logan Turner, 30, was out with friends celebrating his recent birthday, his mother, Danita Turner, told the Dayton Daily News. \u201cHe was very generous and loving and the world\u2019s best son,\u201d she said. Nicholas Cumer, 25, was a graduate student in the cancer care program at Saint Francis University in Loretto, Pennsylvania, according to a statement from the university. \u201cNicholas was dedicated to caring for others,\u201d wrote the university president, Malachi Van Tassell. Thomas McNichols, 25, was a father of four young children. His aunt Donna Johnson described McNichols as a \u201cgentle giant\u201d. Monica Brickhouse, 39, worked as a recovery specialist for an insurance company. And Beatrice Warren-Curtis, 36, was friends with Brickhouse. \u201cTo lose a loved one to senseless violence is just unfair, especially since it could be preventable !!\u201d a friend of the women wrote on Facebook.",

Secrets of a Schoolyard Millionaire \u2013 Nat Amoore Penguin Random House (Australia), ages 9+ Any fan of the Treehouse series will have spent hours inventing the storeys, contraptions and rooms that would be present in their own treehouses, and Nat Amoore\u2019s debut novel posits an equally enticing prospect: what would you do if you found a million dollars in your backyard? When faced with this dilemma, 10-year-old Tess Heckleston, schoolyard entrepreneur and budding businesswoman, is sure she\u2019s got it figured all out. It will surprise few that Tess\u2019 foray into being an instant millionaire is chequered with obstacles not limited to suspicious adults, greedy bad guys and best intentions gone awry. For more: Secrets of a Schoolyard Millionaire is a standalone title. Runaway Robot \u2013 Frank Cottrell-Boyce and Steven Lenton Pan Macmillan (UK), ages 9+ Frank Cottrell-Boyce is hands-down one of my favourite children\u2019s authors; his work has a lot in common with that of early Morris Gleitzman. A former winner of the Carnegie medal, Cottrell-Boyce\u2019s novels are adventures with a touch of Dahlian absurdity, along with emotionally affecting tales of friendship, family and the complex lives of kids. Boyce\u2019s most recent release, Runaway Robot, does not disappoint. This story is of Alfie, a lonely young boy who spends most of his time loitering at the airport, and Eric, the 6ft 2in clumsy robot with super strength that he discovers in lost property. This is sure to satisfy old and new readers, and ideal for Treehouse fans looking to stretch themselves with something more text-heavy.

In the ACT magistrates court on Tuesday, Collaery waived his rights to a committal hearing and prosecutors consented to send his case to the supreme court. Collaery was granted bail and was summoned to appear on 22 August. Haydn Carmichael revealed that his client, Witness K, will plead guilty to a summary offence, one breach of section 39 of the Intelligence Services Act for communicating secret information obtained in the course of his duties as an Australian Secret Intelligence Service agent. Outside the court, Collaery issued a statement that Witness K\u2019s complaint had revealed a \u201ccheating culture motivated by commercial interests\u201d which was both \u201ccontrary to Australia\u2019s national security interests\u201d and unlawful. Collaery said he stood by his legal advice to Witness K, labelling the accusation that he had unlawfully conspired with Witness K \u201ccontemptible\u201d. The two men were charged with disclosing information about the bugging of Timor-Leste government buildings in 2004, an operation that gave Australia the upper hand in talks to carve up resources in the Timor Sea.

Collaery said the prosecution was \u201ca very determined push to hide dirty political linen \u2026 under the guise of national security imperatives\u201d. He said an open court process would reveal the disclosures were \u201ctotally unrelated to national security concerns\u201d. Collaery said he had \u201cgreat empathy for Witness K and the struggle [he] has gone through spiritually, mentally and physically\u201d.

      "bodyText": "President Trump will visit El Paso on Wednesday in the aftermath of the Walmart shooting. The mayor is not exactly psyched. Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, responded vaguely to the calls for Senate action on gun control. Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, was not thrilled by his response. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin designated China as a currency manipulator. The Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, has some thoughts on the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, and his response to the calls for gun control: El Paso Mayor Dee Margo made the announcement just now: Amid a trade war between Washington and Beijing, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin has deemed China a currency manipulator under the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988. \u201cAs a result of this determination, Secretary Mnuchin will engage with the International Monetary Fund to eliminate the unfair competitive advantage created by China\u2019s latest actions,\u201d the Treasury Department said in a statement. According to the Treasury Department, \u201cChina has taken concrete steps to devalue its currency, while maintaining substantial foreign exchange reserves despite active use of such tools in the past.\u201d The current exchange rate is $1 to 7.05 yuan. The yuan hasn\u2019t traded beyond 7 per $1 since 2008. Democrats have been pushing for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to bring his party in line in the Senate on gun control. He released a vague statement just now on the issue: Guardian reporter Sam Levin is in El Paso, talking to parents of Joaquin Oliver, who was killed in the Parkland shooting on 18 February 2018. In the aftermath of the deadly shooting in El Paso, President Trump vowed to support the city reeling from tragedy. Well: The bill stems from a Feb. 11 via his 2020 reelection campaign, according to the Center for Public Integrity. The campaign owes thousands of dollars in police and public safety-related bills and late fees. President Trump has taken heat for his incorrect reference to Toledo, Ohio earlier today. CNN\u2019s Manu Raju astutely pointed out that in the photograph snapped by Reuters photographer Leah Millis, the president\u2019s teleprompter is clearly visible and the misidentification appears to be a fumble all of his own doing. Hey all, Vivian Ho taking over for Joan Greve. Let\u2019s see where the day takes us, shall we? That\u2019s it from me today. Vivian Ho will be taking it over on the West Coast for the next few hours. Here is where the day stands so far: Trump issued a very robotic statement on this weekend\u2019s shootings in El Paso and Toledo -- oh, sorry, Dayton. And while he called on Americans to \u201ccondemn racism, bigotry and white supremacy,\u201d he made no mention of how his own rhetoric has fueled racist sentiments. Barack Obama released a statement expressing condolences for the victims and demanding reform. But he also issued a veiled criticism of Trump, demanding that Americans \u201csoundly reject language coming out of the mouths of any of our leaders that feeds a climate of fear and hatred.\u201d Prominent Democrats, including 2020 candidates, pushed Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell to take up two pieces of gun legislation that have already passed the House. (Trump has vowed to veto the bills.) Wall Street saw its worst day of the year, with the Dow falling nearly 3 percent as Trump escalates his trade war against China. Cesar Sayoc, the man who sent pipe bombs to Trump critics just before the 2018 midterms, was sentenced to 20 years in prison. Vivian will have more coverage on the continuing fallout from this weekend\u2019s shootings, so stay tuned. The Dow closed down 767 points, representing a 2.9-percent drop in the market. But that was a slight improvement from its low point of the day, when the Dow was down 961 points. The market troubles come as Trump escalates his trade war against China. The president announced plans last week to slap a 10 percent tariff on the remaining $300 billion worth of Chinese imports starting Sept. 1. The pain spread beyond the Dow. The S&amp;P 500 fell 2.98 percent, and the Nasdaq dropped 3.47 percent. Beijing also saw its currency, the yuan, dip to its lowest exchange rate in 11 years. Nancy Pelosi has sent a letter to her Democratic colleagues in which the House speaker emphasized that the onus was on the Senate and the White House to advance gun-control legislation. The House has already passed two gun bills that the Republican-controlled Senate has refused to take up and that Trump has vowed to veto. But there were talks earlier today about the House returning from recess to pass more gun-control legislation. Pelosi seems to be making clear here that she will not call the House back until the Senate takes up a bill on the matter. Many Hispanic Texans who have never owned guns are rushing to buy firearms in the wake of the El Paso shooting. Our colleague Bryan Mealer reports: The scene on Sunday at Gun Central, located along Interstate 10 and two miles from where bodies are still being recovered, was more reminiscent of Black Friday than the wake of a national tragedy. People crowded shoulder to shoulder to consult with harried employees, pondering over pistols and assault rifles, banana clips and ammo. Others lined up for their turn inside the store\u2019s indoor shooting range. Staccato gunfire thundered behind the thin walls. \u2018I\u2019m on high alert,\u2019 said April Sanchez, a marketing executive who along with her husband was buying her first weapon. \u2018I never thought I\u2019d carry a gun, but now I want something to defend myself, to defend my fellow El Pasoans.\u2019 ... \u2018This isn\u2019t something I\u2019m proud of,\u2019 she added. \u2018It makes me sad and angry that I\u2019m even here. I\u2019m heartbroken, but I\u2019m also afraid.\u2019 Cesar Sayoc, who previously pleaded guilty to 65 counts for mailing explosive devices to prominent Democrats and media figures days before the 2018 midterms, was sentenced to 20 years in prison. Our colleague Victoria Bekiempis reports: Known as a fanatical Trump supporter, Sayoc, who was also reportedly a former bodybuilder and male exotic dancer. He sent 16 crude explosives to 13 intended victims across the US, prosecutors said. None of the bombs, which prosecutors called \u2018improvised explosive devices\u2019, exploded. Sayoc\u2019s targets included former Democratic Party vice-president Joe Biden, Senator and Democratic 2020 presidential candidate Cory Booker, former CIA director John Brennan, former National Intelligence director James Clapper, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the New York offices of cable news network CNN, actor Robert De Niro, Democratic Senator and 2020 candidate Kamala Harris, former Attorney General Eric Holder, former US president Barack Obama, billionaire liberal philanthropist George Soros, Democrat presidential candidate Tom Steyer, and US Congresswoman Maxine Waters. Meanwhile, the National Rifle Association put out a statement praising Trump\u2019s morning statement. The pro-gun lobbying group added that it \u201cwelcomes the President\u2019s call to address the root causes of the horrific acts of violence that have occurred in our country.\u201d It is safe to assume that the NRA does not consider lax gun laws to be one of those \u201croot causes.\u201d Democratic presidential candidates thanked Barack Obama for putting out a statement on this weekend\u2019s shootings, pointing to him as an example of how a president can provide \u201cmoral clarity\u201d in such moments of tragedy: Barack Obama has issued a statement expressing condolences for the victims of the El Paso and Dayton shootings and demanding action on gun control. And although he did not mention his successor by name, the former president called on Americans to \u201csoundly reject language coming out of the mouths of any of our leaders that feeds a climate of fear and hatred or normalizes racist sentiments.\u201d Obama argued that while such language was not new, it has been \u201cat the root of most human tragedy throughout history.\u201d He specifically named slavery, Jim Crow and the Holocaust. Over Twitter this morning, Trump floated the idea of linking background check legislation to immigration reform. The suggestion was widely denounced as a concession to the white supremacist attacker who posted an anti-immigrant screed before killing 22 in the El Paso shooting. But even Trump\u2019s advisers were unaware of the idea before he publicly pondered it, the New York Times reports: When a draft of his Monday morning remarks began circulating on Sunday night, they did not mention background checks, according to two people briefed on them. A new version Monday morning did not mention background checks or immigration, those people said. So aides were startled to discover that the president, sitting in the White House residence, had posted a tweet linking the two issues. A string of meetings followed, including one with a small group of aides in the residence, ahead of the speech. Most aides argued the linkage was a mistake, and the president dropped both the immigration idea and the call for background checks. El Paso officials confirmed that 22 people have died as a result of Saturday\u2019s shooting. Here is the story of two of them: Jordan and Andre Anchondo went to Walmart to buy decorations for their six-year-old daughter\u2019s birthday party. They brought along their two-month-old baby, a boy named Paul. After the shooting began, family members frantically tried to reach Jordan and Andre. They were contacted by authorities hours later, asking them to come to the hospital. Family members said it appeared that Andre had died trying to protect his wife and child. Based on the baby\u2019s minor injuries, it appears that Jordan also used her body to shield Paul from the gunfire. She was holding him in her arms when she died. Senator Tim Scott, a Republican of South Carolina, has condemned white supremacy in much harsher terms than the leader of his party. Scott is currently the only Republican serving in the Senate who is black. The chamber\u2019s two other black members, Cory Booker and Kamala Harris, are Democrats. Senator Pat Toomey, the Republican who helped craft a background checks bill after the Sandy Hook shooting, has voiced interest in resurrecting the legislation. But it\u2019s unclear if the chamber\u2019s majority leader, Mitch McConnell, would actually take up the bill \u2013 or if any other Republicans would support it. After all, very few Republican senators backed the background checks legislation after the Sandy Hook gunman killed 20 elementary school students, as a Washington Post reporter noted: Trump highlighted a line from his statement this morning to encourage Americans to come together as \u201cONE PEOPLE.\u201d \u201cOpen wounds cannot heal if we are divided,\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter. The tweet comes after one of his senior advisers, Kellyanne Conway, suggested that the president\u2019s statement was meant to set politics aside after the tragedies. But Represemtative Vernoica Escobar, who represents the part of El Paso where Saturday\u2019s shooting occurred, struck a different note. \u201c[U]nless we talk about solutions, it becomes too easy for time to pass and America to move on,\u201d the first-term Democratic congresswoman told the New Yorker. \u201cWe can console the community, we can bring people together, we can care for one another, while at the same time talking about the real problems that caused this epidemic. \u201cI don\u2019t understand the mind-set that you can\u2019t talk about what happened because somehow it is disrespectful to the victims. I think what is disrespectful to the victims is to ignore why it happened. There are going to be 20 funerals in this community. We absolutely have to talk about why.\u201d Mexico\u2019s foreign minister has just announced that another Mexican citizen - the eighth - has died as a result of the El Paso shooting. Marcelo Ebrard named the latest victim as Juan de Dios Vel\u00e1zquez Chairez from the central state of Zacatecas. \u201cEight compatriots have died because of Saturday\u2019s terrorist act,\u201d Ebrard tweeted. Ebrard made the announcement as he arrived in El Paso to offer support to affected Mexicans. A day before Trump read his remarks on the shootings, the American Psychological Association put out a statement warning against blaming such attacks on mental illness. The president was criticized by many for using his speech to focus on, among other things, the need to address mental illness in America. \u201cRoutinely blaming mass shootings on mental illness is unfounded and stigmatizing,\u201d APA president Rosie Phillips Davis said in her statement. \u201cResearch has shown that only a very small percentage of violent acts are committed by people who are diagnosed with, or in treatment for, mental illness. \u201cThe rates of mental illness are roughly the same around the world, yet other countries are not experiencing these traumatic events as often as we face them. One critical factor is access to, and the lethality of, the weapons that are being used in these crimes. Adding racism, intolerance and bigotry to the mix is a recipe for disaster. \u201cIf we want to address the gun violence that is tearing our country apart, we must keep our focus on finding evidence-based solutions. This includes restricting access to guns for people who are at risk for violence and working with psychologists and other experts to find solutions to the intolerance that is infecting our nation and the public dialogue.\u201d A bipartisan pair of senators said that they separately spoke to Trump about legislation to strength the US background checks system and that the president seemed supportive of the idea. But Trump made no mention of promoting such legislation in his statement on the shootings this morning. Dayton Mayor Nan Whaley said that Trump may be visiting the city on Wednesday as it works to heal from the mass shooting that left nine victims dead. But Whaley also got in a jab at the president, who misidentified the site of the shooting as Toledo this morning. \u201cAnd you know he might be going to Toledo, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Whaley said with a smile. The White House is working on its messaging around the shooting, starting with an edit of Trump\u2019s morning statement. The White House scratched out the president\u2019s erroneous reference to Toledo in its official transcript, per an AP reporter: And Trump\u2019s senior adviser Kellyanne Conway told reporters that the president set politics aside in his statement, per a Reuters reporter: In reality, Trump\u2019s focus on mental illness this morning echoes a key talking point from the National Rifle Association. Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren criticized Trump for focusing on mental illness in his morning statement on the shootings. She urged the country to identify white supremacy for the domestic terrorism it is. The Massachusetts senator made a similar statement during the Democratic debates in Detroit last week. \u201cWe need to call out white supremacy for what it is: domestic terrorism. And it poses a threat to the United States,\u201d Warren said at the time. The hashtag #WhiteSupremacistinChief started trending on Twitter after Trump delivered his morning statement on the shootings. Filmmaker Ava DuVernay was among the first to use the hashtag after the president blamed \u201cFake News\u201d for contributing to \u201canger and rage\u201d in the country. The progressive group Democracy for America also used the hashtag to mock Trump for misidentifying the location of the second shooting as Toledo instead of Dayton: Trump spent more time blaming the Internet than condemning white supremacy in his morning statement on the shootings. According to the Washington Post, the president used 105 words of his speech to call out the Internet and social media. He spent 80 words condemning racism and hatred. He also used only 53 words to address access to guns, compared to 62 words on mental illness and evil. House Democratic leaders are debating whether they should return from recess to take up more gun-control legislation. The House has already passed two gun bills that the Republican-controlled Senate has refused to consider. Trump has also vowed to veto the legislation. But House Democrats are divided on whether returning to Capitol Hill would achieve their desired result, per a Politico reporter: Bennie G. Thompson, the Democratic chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, issued a statement criticizing Trump\u2019s statement on this weekend\u2019s shootings. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s words today are meaningless,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cWe know his vile and racist words have incited violence and attacks on Americans.\u201d Representative Joaquin Castro, who represents much of San Antonio, denounced Trump\u2019s statement on the shootings and called on the president to stop demonizing Hispanic immigrants. Castro\u2019s brother, Democratic presidential candidate Juli\u00e1n Castro, similarly criticized Trump\u2019s statement and accused the president of serving as a \u201cnational spokesperson\u201d for white nationalism. A hospital official in El Paso said another victim of the shooting has died. The sad news raises the death toll from the attack to 22. Mexican newspapers have put out searing cartoons criticizing Trump\u2019s response to the El Paso shooting, as our Latin American correspondent Tom Phillips notes: Trump has turned his attention away from the shootings if his Twitter feed is any indication. The president has instead been busy attacking China for harming America\u2019s economy and repeating the (false) claim that US consumers are not covering the cost of his trade war: Another Democratic presidential candidate, Cory Booker, has dismissed Trump\u2019s statement on the shootings this morning as woefully lacking. The New Jersey senator specifically cited Trump\u2019s focus on mental illness in his remarks. \u201cMental illness didn\u2019t kill the people of Dayton,\u201d Booker said. \u201cPeople are too easily getting their hands on guns.\u201d Booker added that Trump has failed to take personal responsibility for how he has contributed to intensifying racist sentiment. \u201cYou can\u2019t speak out of one side of your mouth about the need for us to come together as a country but consistently do things that divide this nation and pit us against each other, that fuel racial bigotry and hatred,\u201d Booker said. He said Trump\u2019s handling of the tragedies represented a \u201ccatastrophic failure of presidential leadership.\u201d Booker also offered Trump some advice on how to start taking responsibility: \u201cSpeak to how you have contributed to the hate and the division and the bigotry and the racism.\u201d Mexico\u2019s president Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador has urged the United States to end the \u201cindiscriminate sale of guns\u201d in the wake of the El Paso shooting, which claimed 7 Mexican lives. Speaking at a daily press conference, Mexico\u2019s leftist leader said the attack underlined the dangers of allowing citizens \u201cto acquire weapons in any shopping centre, as currently happens, without any control\u201d. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t happen in our country,\u201d L\u00f3pez Obrador told reporters. \u201cWe have great respect for the decisions of other governments, but we believe these appalling events that have taken place in the United States should lead to contemplation, discussion and a decision to control the indiscriminate sale of guns\u201d. L\u00f3pez Obrador said he was not seeking to meddle in the internal affairs of another country \u201cbut this matter must be reconsidered because it affects Americans, and it also affects us\u201d. Mexico\u2019s foreign minister, Marcelo Ebrard, traveled to Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, the Mexican border city opposite El Paso, on Monday to offer support to the families of Mexican citizens killed and wounded in the attack. On Sunday Ebrard said his government considered the 21-year-old shooting suspect a terrorist and would consider charging him over the \u201cbarbaric act\u201d. Mexican officials believe the attack deliberately targeted the Latino community. \u201cThe intentionality of the attack against the Mexicans and the Latino community in El Paso is frightening. NO to hate speech. NO to xenophobic discourse,\u201d Mexico\u2019s ambassador to the US, Martha B\u00e1rcena, tweeted on Sunday. On Monday, Mexican newspapers carried a series of scathing cartoons that partly blamed Donald Trump for encouraging such hatred. One, in the Milenio newspaper, showed the US president breathing fire onto a bundle of matches. Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer released a statement calling on Mitch McConnell to bring the Senate back from its recess in order to pass a background check bill. The bill has already passed the Democratic-controlled House, but the Senate has not taken it up, and Trump has said he would veto it. The House and Senate are both currently adjourned for the summer recess and are not expected to return until Sept. 9. Democratic presidential candidates have similarly demanded that McConnell call the Senate back to take up the issue: Trump has postponed a planned trip to Florida tomorrow in reaction to this weekend\u2019s shootings. The president was previously scheduled to visit the Villages, a Republican stronghold, to discuss Medicare. The White House did not say when the trip would be rescheduled. Democratic presidential candidate Juli\u00e1n Castro said in a tweet that Trump\u2019s statement on the shootings rang hollow. He also accused the president of serving as the \u201cnational spokesperson\u201d of white nationalism. The El Paso Police Department just shared the sad news that another victim of the white supremacist attack this weekend has died: In lieu of introducing firearms restrictions following back-to-back mass shootings in El Paso, Texas and Dayton, Ohio, Trump called for \u201cred flag\u201d laws. The National Rifle Association, the powerful firearms lobbying group, has opposed the laws in the past, both for domestic abusers and as part of a broader effort to combat mass shootings. In April, the group opposed an expansion of the Violence Against Women Act to prevent people convicted of a misdemeanor domestic violence or stalking charge from purchasing a firearm. The law also closed the \u201cboyfriend loophole,\u201d ensuring unmarried victims of domestic violence would have similar protections. In May, the NRA came out against a suggestion that cities and towns should enact laws to temporarily remove firearms from people deemed to be a threat, made by Republican Senator Lindsey Graham. Graham said he did not support the legislation at the federal level. All of the top 10 recipients of National Rifle Association donations are Republican Senators, according to the watchdog group Public Citizen. Democratic presidential candidate Tim Ryan, who represents Ohio\u2019s 13th District in the House, slammed Trump for confusing Dayton with Toledo in his statement this morning. As Trump was concluding his remarks, Trump accidentally offered his condolences to the victims in Toledo, which is roughly 150 miles from the shooting site in Dayton. \u201cIt just shows the level of disengagement,\u201d Ryan told CNN, arguing that Trump\u2019s mistake reflected his \u201cdiminished mental capacity\u201d to deal with America\u2019s pressing problems. \u201cIt\u2019s a slap in the face to the people here in Dayton.\u201d Ryan also noted that the Democratic-controlled House has passed two pieces of gun legislation that could help reduce the number of tragedies like those in El Paso and Dayton. Trump has vowed to veto both. Dayton\u2019s mayor, Nan Whaley, said she spoke with Trump yesterday evening before a vigil for the shooting\u2019s victims. When asked how he felt about civilians bringing high-power firearms into his community, Police Chief Richard Biehl said it was \u201cfundamentally problematic.\u201d Dayton\u2019s police chief said he didn\u2019t yet have any further clarification on how the shooter\u2019s sister became one of the victims. There have been many questions on whether the shooter specifically targeted his 22-year-old sister or if she was simply caught in an indiscriminate spray of bullets. \u201cWe just don\u2019t know,\u201d Chief Richard Biehl said. He said he found it hard to believe the shooter would have targeted a family member, but he also questioned how the attacker could not have recognized his weapon was pointed toward his sister. Richard Biehl, Dayton\u2019s police chief, said his officers still had a lot of evidence to go through before making a determination on the shooter\u2019s motive. But he noted that there was no indication as of yet that racism may have motivated the shooter. \u201cWe\u2019re not seeing any [evidence] at this time to suggest that race is a motive,\u201d Biehl said. Six of the nine victims shot and killed in Dayton were black. Dayton\u2019s mayor and police chief delivered an update this morning on the investigation into the shooting this weekend. Mayor Nan Whaley said there was \u201cnot much movement on the investigation\u201d yet, but Chief Richard Biehl offered some numbers on those injured and the number of shots fired. Biehl said between 27 and 32 people had been injured in the attack, and at least 14 of those sustained gunshot wounds. Others were injured trying to flee the scene. The police chief also said that at least 41 spent shell casings had been recovered, but he noted that some evidence may have been lost due to the chaos as the shooting unfolded. The shooter would have been carrying a maximum of 250 rounds, Biehl said. Trump\u2019s prepared statement today emphasized how his responses to various mass shootings have differed depending on who carried out the attack. From a Politico reporter: The 2015 attack in San Bernardino was carried out by a husband and wife who authorities said were inspired by Islamic extremists. Trump was widely criticized for confusing Dayton, the site of one of this weekend\u2019s shootings, with Toledo. Democratic presidential candidate Tim Ryan, who represents Ohio\u2019s 13th District in the House, tweeted this shortly after the speech: But it is only the most recent instance of Trump misidentifying the location of a mass shooting. In November 2017, a message from Trump\u2019s Twitter account read, \u201cMay God be w/ the people of Sutherland Springs, Texas. The FBI and Law Enforcement has arrived.\u201d But the Sutherland Springs shooting had actually occurred days before. It seemed that Trump was trying to reference a more recent attack on the Rancho Tehama Elementary School in northern California. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden also misidentified the locations of both shootings while speaking to donors last night. The former vice president expressed sorrow about \u201cthe tragic events in Houston today and also in Michigan the day before,\u201d according to a pool report. He later corrected himself. Trump is also being criticized for the canned delivery of his statement on the shootings. From a politics editor at the Root: From the press secretary for Democratic presidential candidate Juli\u00e1n Castro: Trump\u2019s statement on the shootings was quickly criticized for downplaying the role of white supremacy and lenient gun laws. Although the president called on America to \u201ccondemn racism, bigotry and white supremacy,\u201d he avoided any mention of his own role in fueling such rhetoric. One political scientist put it this way: His focus on violent video games and mental-health care also enraged commentators who emphasized that Trump avoided outlining any specific action he would take to reform gun laws. From a former Clinton White House aide: From a writer for Salon: And our colleague Sabrina Siddiqui noted that Trump even messed up which city the second shooting took place in: Trump issued a statement on the attacks in El Paso and Dayton in which he blamed violent video games and mental health-care, among other things, for mass shootings. Condemning the \u201cbarbaric slaughters,\u201d Trump called on the nation to reject racism. \u201cIn one voice, our nation must condemn racism, bigotry and white supremacy,\u201d Trump said. But he then pivoted to any number of other subjects -- including violent video games, access to mental-heath care and the federal death penalty. Trump has taken the podium at the White House to deliver a statement on the shootings in El Paso and Dayton. Watch it here. Trump is expected to speak on the shootings at any moment. In the meantime, here are some of the front pages from around the country about the two tragedies: Democratic presidential candidates are coming out in force this morning to condemn Trump\u2019s response to the shootings in the strongest possible terms. Kirsten Gillibrand was on CNN this morning accusing Trump of \u201cemboldening white supremacists,\u201d adding later that \u201che is one himself.\u201d Asked whether America should strengthen its background checks system, the New York senator said, \u201cOf course we do.\u201d She then quickly pivoted to Trump\u2019s role in the two tragedies. \u201cThis president needs to take a lot more responsibility than that,\u201d Gillibrand said. \u201cHe\u2019s been emboldening white supremacists his entire presidency and his campaign. He\u2019s been using language to demonize immigrants, to demonize the vulnerable his entire presidency.\u201d Gillibrand also zeroed in on Trump\u2019s own ideology. \u201cThat is what a lack of leadership in the White House looks like,\u201d she said. \u201cHe is not only egging on white supremacy and white nationalism, but he is one himself. He has been using racist language as a candidate and as president for two years, especially against immigrants.\u201d She also dismissed Trump\u2019s suggestion of linking background check legislation to immigration reform as \u201cabsurd.\u201d \u201cThis is part of the problem,\u201d Gillibrand said. \u201cHe continues to try to demonize people seeking asylum, people needing our help.\u201d The nine victims of the Dayton shooting ranged in age from 22 to 57. Here are their names: An Ohio State Representative is coming under fire for arguing mass shootings should be blamed, in part, on same-sex marriage and rights for transgender people. The representative argued in a Facebook post both contribute to \u201cbreakdown\u201d in society. Ohio State Representative Candice Keller represents a conservative district, almost entirely white, district outside of Cincinnati, Ohio. She is the executive director of a crisis pregnancy center, and was elected in 2016, with Trump. In the past, Keller has been criticized for speaking with a local white supremacist podcaster, has compared the Planned Parenthood logo to a swastika, and supported an Ohio bill which would \u201cabolish\u201d abortion and make it punishable by the death penalty. The Guardian spoke with Keller in April, in an interview where she said abortion rights could cause such a rift in the country that it may lead to civil war. \u201cAbortion is not the law in this country, neither is gay marriage. All these cases are case law,\u201d said Keller, referring to the US Supreme Court precedents legalizing both abortion and gay marriage. \u201cThey can be challenged at any time, just like we are now challenging abortion.\u201d Keller said she believed in the future, \u201cJust like we used to have slave states and free states, there will come a time when Ohio will become a life state, and states along the East coast you will be able to abort your child,\u201d said Keller. \u201cThose will be states where you have a culture of life.\u201d \u201cWhether this ever leads to a tragedy, like it did before with our Civil War, I can\u2019t say,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be something your generation, and your children\u2019s generation, will have to deal with.\u201d The president of a startup news outlet in El Paso lambasted Trump for trying to tie immigration reform to a background checks bill: Another Democratic presidential candidate, Tim Ryan, mocked Trump\u2019s suggestion of linking a background checks bill to immigration reform. \u201cThat\u2019s an absolute freaking joke that he\u2019s going to tie this to the most polarized issue happening in the United States,\u201d the Ohio congressman said on CNN. \u201cMitch McConnell needs to get off his ass and do something.\u201d A CNN reporter also noted that Trump has made similar promises in the wake of previous mass shootings: Democratic presidential candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke issued an impassioned condemnation of Trump\u2019s response to the shootings on MSNBC this morning. Speaking in his hometown of El Paso, the former Texas congressman recounted the president\u2019s hateful rhetoric toward immigrants. \u201cThe only modern Western democracy that I can think of that said anything close to this is the Third Reich, Nazi Germany,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said. He went on to criticize journalists who question whether Trump\u2019s racist comments should be labeled as such. \u201cAnyone who is surprised is part of this problem right now, including members of the media who ask: \u2018Hey Beto, do you think the president is racist?\u2019 Well, Jesus Christ, of course he\u2019s racist,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said. \u201cHe\u2019s been racist from day one.\u201d The editorial board of another conservative outlet, National Review, argued that the El Paso shooting showed the need for America to root out white supremacy. \u201cIn America, as abroad, we see our fair share of inexplicable violence,\u201d the board wrote. \u201cBut the patterns on display over the last few years have revealed that we are contending here not with another \u2018lone wolf,\u2019 but with the fruit of a murderous and resurgent ideology \u2014 white supremacy \u2014 that deserves to be treated by the authorities in the same manner as has been the threat posed by militant Islam.\u201d The editors of the magazine also called on Trump to \u201ccondemn these actions repeatedly and unambiguously, in both general and specific terms.\u201d But perhaps tellingly, the editorial also advised readers against considering gun control legislation. \u201cWe will see a myopic focus on guns in the coming days, tied to a broader discussion of America\u2019s \u2018mass shooting problem,\u2019\u201d the board wrote. \u201cThis will be a mistake \u2014 not because America does not have such a problem, but because to focus on limiting a certain tool in a country with half a billion of those tools in circulation and a constitutional provision protecting their ownership is to set oneself up for guaranteed failure.\u201d Trump began today by blaming \u201cFake News\u201d for having \u201ccontributed greatly to the anger and rage that has built up over many years.\u201d In doing so, he was echoing a line from the El Paso shooter, a Politico reporter noted: The New York Post, one of Trump\u2019s favorite newspapers that is owned by conservative media mogul Rupert Murdoch, is out with a front-page editorial today calling for \u201cthe return of an assault-weapons ban.\u201d But many journalists have noted that the right-leaning outlet issued a similar plea after the Parkland shooting to no avail: The Democratic chairman of the House judiciary committee, Jerry Nadler, compared Trump\u2019s response to the shootings to Nazi Germany: And a University of Alabama law professor made this point about Trump\u2019s morning tweet suggesting that a background checks bill should be linked to immigration reform: At the same time, the president\u2019s daughter and White House advisor Ivanka Trump called white supremacy \u201cterrorism\u201d in a tweet. The language echoed a New York Times editorial over the weekend. She was immediately criticized, including by a lawmaker who was the recent target of a racist tweet by President Trump, Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan. In July, Trump told four female Congresswomen of color to \u201cgo back\u201d to the nations they came from. The tweet played on old racist tropes, and was also inaccurate \u2013 all but one of the women was born in the United States. President Trump is under intense criticism following two back-to-back massacres in Dayton, Ohio and El Paso, Texas, in which dozens of people were killed with military-style assault rifles. In the El Paso shooting, a long manifesto was posted online shortly before the massacre began, saying the attack was motivated by hatred of immigrants. He used language which echoed that often used by President Trump to stoke support for immigration restrictions. Trump responded this morning by blaming the \u201cFake News\u201d media for a contributing to \u201canger and rage,\u201d calling for background checks, and \u201cmarrying\u201d the legislation with immigration reform. \u201cWe must have something good, if not GREAT [sic], come out of these two tragic events!\u201d he tweeted early Monday.",
